<text>The X-Men are a team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by the Marvel Comics. The X-Men first appeared in the self-titled X-Men comic, cover dated September 1963. Due to the X-Men&#x27;s immense popularity, Marvel has launched dozens of spin-off series, called &quot;X-Legs&quot; throughout the years.

Like &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, most X-books feature mutants, humans born with extraordinary powers due to a genetic mutation. Some X-Books feature mutant superhero teams while others feature solo adventures of characters who became popular in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; or another X-Book. Occasionally, X-Books use mutants as a metaphor for racial, religious and other minorities oppressed by society.

For the purpose of this list, &quot;X-Men Comics&quot; will be defined by the following criteria:
* The series was meant to continue indefinitely, was not a limited series. For limited series, see List of X-Men limited series.
* The series featured mostly characters associated with and/or concepts originating in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; or another X-Book, thus &quot;The Defenders&quot; and &quot;The Champions&quot;, which featured both X-Men-related and non-X-Men related characters will not be counted and neither will series which occasionally featured the X-Men characters, such as &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;, &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; and &quot;What If?&quot;.

The Sammamish River begins as an outlet on the north shore of Lake Sammamish, which in turn is fed by several creeks that make up the headwaters of the Sammamish River basin. The most important of these is Issaquah Creek.

The river flows north from the lake through the city of Redmond. The tributary Bear Creek joins the Sammamish from the east, also containing the waters from Evans Creek and Cottage Lake Creek.

After passing through Redmond and parts of unincorporated King County, the Sammamish enters Woodinville where it turns northwest and then west. Little Bear Creek joins the Sammamish at this western turning point from the north. The river continues to bend in a generally westward direction, where it is joined from the north by North Creek in Bothell near the University of Washington, and Swamp Creek in Kenmore.

The Sammamish River enters Lake Washington on the west side of Kenmore.

The Sammamish River basin covers an area from Everett in the north to May Valley in the south. It is part of the larger Lake Washington-Cedar River drainage. The total basin drainage area covers approximately 626 km2 (242 mi2), including the surface of Lake Sammamish. Big Bear Creek is the largest of the four major tributaries that feed the river followed by Little Bear Creek, North Creek, and Swamp Creek. There is also a significant amount of more diffuse drainage, primarily originating from the hills and valley to the west of the river.

==River modifications==
The Sammamish River of the early 1900s has been extensively modified as a result of various human efforts to use the channel for navigation, to utilize the floodplain for agriculture, and to reduce flooding in the Sammamish River valley and Lake Sammamish. Prior to a new chanel being dug sometime prior to 1936, the river was wider and deeper and generally flowed more slowly due to a relatively small difference in elevation between Lake Sammamish and Lake Washington. Prior to these modifications, the river was known as Squak Slough (after a modified pronunciation of the native village at Issaquah) and was navigable over its entire length by shallow-draft steamers and was used to float logs and coal barges from Lake Sammamish to Lake Washington. The mouth of the river was east of its present position.

Although early drainage and navigation improvement efforts in the first couple of decades of the 20th century likely affected the form and function of the river, the most significant modifications occurred as a result of two largely federal-funded navigation and flood control projects. The first major change occurred as a result of the reduction in the mean level and seasonal elevation range of Lake Washington in 1916 as part of the development of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and Lock system, which officially opened June 16, 1917. This effectively increased the elevation difference between Lake Sammamish and Lake Washington and increased the flow rate of the river. It also moved the mouth of the river westward.
The second major change resulted from a King County/ACOE channel dredging, straightening project completed in November 1964 that included construction of a weir at the Lake Sammamish source. This project practically eliminated flooding in the Sammamish River valley and reduced maximum flood elevations and seasonal water surface elevations in Lake Sammamish. The weir was modified in 1998 to improve passage for anadromous salmon during low flow.

==Natural history==
The Sammamish River is home to several runs of salmon and trout, including chinook, coho, sockeye, kokanee, steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. The King County government is currently working on restoring fish habitat along the river.

Several species of birds and mammals are plentiful along the river, including waterfowl such as Canada geese, ducks, and the great blue heron. Bald eagles and beavers are also common sights near the river.

==Recreation==
The Sammamish River Trail is a paved bicycle and walking trail that runs along the river, from Marymoor Park in Redmond, to Bothell, where it connects to the Burke-Gilman Trail to Seattle. The Slough is also the main geographical feature of the former Wayne Golf Course in Bothell. The river is also the home of Sammamish Rowing Association which is a non-profit community rowing facility based on King County Parks property on the West shore supporting recreational and competitive rowing for high school and adult rowers. The Sammamish Rowing facility and boathouse are West of the river, with the dock right along the West Shore of the river, opposite Marymoor Dog Park.

<doc id="611421" wikidata="Q1073408" url="?curid=611421" title="Hostname">
<text>In computer networking, a hostname (archaically nodename) is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network and that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication, such as the World Wide Web. Hostnames may be simple names consisting of a single word or phrase, or they may be structured. Each hostname usually has at least one numeric network address associated with it for routing packets for performance and other reasons.

Internet hostnames may have appended the name of a Domain Name System (DNS) domain, separated from the host-specific label by a period (&quot;dot&quot;). In the latter form, a hostname is also called a domain name. If the domain name is completely specified, including a top-level domain of the Internet, then the hostname is said to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Hostnames that include DNS domains are often stored in the Domain Name System together with the IP addresses of the host they represent for the purpose of mapping the hostname to an address, or the reverse process.

== Internet hostnames ==
On the Internet, a hostname is a domain name assigned to a host computer. This is usually a combination of the host&#x27;s local name with its parent domain&#x27;s name. For example, &quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot; consists of a local hostname (&quot;en&quot;) and the domain name &quot;wikipedia.org&quot;. This kind of hostname is translated into an IP address via the local hosts file, or the DNS resolver. It is possible for a single host computer to have several hostnames but generally, the operating system of the host prefers to have one hostname that the host uses for itself.

Any domain name can also be a hostname, as long as the restrictions mentioned below are followed. So, for example, both &quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot; and &quot;wikipedia.org&quot; are hostnames because they both have IP addresses assigned to them. A hostname may be a domain name if it is properly organized into the domain name system. A domain name may be a hostname if it has been assigned to an Internet host and associated with the host&#x27;s IP address.

==Syntax==
Hostnames are composed of a sequence of labels concatenated with dots. For example, &quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot; is a hostname. Each label must be 1 to 63 octets long. The entire hostname, including the delimiting dots, has a maximum of 253 ASCII characters.

The Internet standards (Request for Comments) for protocols specify that labels may contain only the ASCII letters &quot;a&quot; through &quot;z&quot; (in a case-insensitive manner), the digits &quot;0&quot; through &quot;9&quot;, and the hyphen-minus character (&#x27;-&#x27;). The original specification of hostnames required that labels start with an alpha character and not end with a hyphen. However, a subsequent specification permitted hostname labels to start with digits. Internationalized domain names are stored in the Domain Name System as ASCII strings using Punycode transcription.

While a hostname may not contain other characters, such as the underscore character (&quot;_&quot;), other DNS names may contain the underscore. Systems such as DomainKeys and service records use the underscore as a means to assure that their special character is not confused with hostnames. For example, &quot;_http._sctp.www.example.com&quot; specifies a service pointer for an SCTP-capable webserver host (www) in the domain &quot;example.com&quot;. Notwithstanding the standard, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, and Safari allow underscores in hostnames, although cookies in IE do not work correctly if any part of the hostname contains an underscore character.

However, it is valid to attempt to resolve a hostname that consists of an underscore. E.g. &quot;_.example.com&quot;. This is used by RFC 7816 to reduce the amount of information that is made available to intermediate DNS servers during an iterative query. The Query Name Minimisation feature is enabled by default in BIND 9.14.0.

The hostname &quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot; is composed of the DNS labels &quot;en&quot; (hostname or leaf domain), &quot;wikipedia&quot; (second-level domain), and &quot;org&quot; (top-level domain). Labels such as &quot;2600&quot; and &quot;3abc&quot; may be used in hostnames, but &quot;-hi-&quot;, &quot;_hi_,&quot; and &quot;*hi*&quot; are invalid.

A hostname is considered to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) when all labels up to and including the top-level domain name (TLD) are specified. The hostname &quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot; terminates with the top-level domain &quot;org&quot; and is thus fully qualified. Depending on the operating system DNS software implementation, an unqualified hostname may be automatically combined with a default domain name configured into the system in order to complete the fully qualified domain name. As an example, a student at MIT may be able to send mail to &quot;joe@csail&quot; and have it automatically qualified by the mail system to be sent to &quot;joecsail.mit.edu&quot;.

General guidelines on choosing a good hostname are outlined in RFC 1178.

==Example==
&quot;saturn&quot; and &quot;jupiter&quot; may be the hostnames of two devices connected to a network named &quot;PC&quot;. Within &quot;PC&quot;, the devices are addressed by their hostnames. The domain names of the devices are &#x27; and &#x27;, respectively. If &quot;PC&quot; is registered as a second-level domain name in the Internet, e.g., as &#x27;, the hosts may be addressed by the fully qualified domain names &#x27; and &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="611424" wikidata="Q7193201" url="?curid=611424" title="Pig (dice game)">
<text>Pig is a simple die game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a .

As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations, including the use of two dice instead of one. Commercial variants of two-dice Pig include &quot;Pass the Pigs&quot;, &quot;Pig Dice&quot;, and &quot;Skunk&quot;. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.

Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as &quot;jeopardy dice games&quot;, where the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains.

== Gameplay ==
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until a is rolled or the player decides to &quot;hold&quot;:

* If the player rolls a , they score nothing and it becomes the next player&#x27;s turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player&#x27;s turn continues.
* If a player chooses to &quot;hold&quot;, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player&#x27;s turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn and rolls a . Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a , and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a , and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence , , , , , after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score.

== Optimal play ==
Optimal play for 2-player Pig was computed by Todd W. Neller and visualized by Clifton G. M. Presser in 2001. At any time, the relevant decision information includes the player&#x27;s score, the opponent&#x27;s score, and the turn total. Such information corresponds to a 3D point in the graph&#x27;s space. If this point is inside the gray solid, the player should roll. Otherwise, the player should hold.

Many 2-dice variants have been analysed, and human-playable Pig strategies have been compared to optimal play. For example:

* &quot;Hold at 20&quot; is a popular strategy. Each turn, the player rolls until they score 20 or more, then holds. This strategy has an 8% disadvantage against optimal play.
* &quot;Hold at 25&quot; was found by Neller and Presser to be more effective. This has a 4.2% disadvantage against optimal play. 
* &quot;4 scoring turns&quot; holds at 25 on the first turn, then on subsequent turns, divides the amount needed to reach 100 by the number of turns remaining. This has a 3.3% disadvantage against optimal play.
* &quot;End race or keep pace&quot;. If either player has a score of 71 or higher, roll to win. Otherwise, hold on 21 plus the difference between scores divided by 8. This has a 0.9% disadvantage against optimal play.

== Variations ==
=== Two-Dice Pig ===

This variation is the same as Pig, except:
*Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a , their sum is added to the turn total.
*If a single is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
*If two &#x27;s are rolled, the player&#x27;s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
* If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is &quot;obligated&quot; to roll again (possible sub-variation of the two-dice game).

Some versions of this game instead use as the &quot;bad&quot; die face.

=== Big Pig ===
This variation is the same as Two-Dice Pig, except:
*If two &#x27;s are rolled, the player adds 25 to the turn total.
*If other doubles are rolled, the player adds twice the value of the dice to the turn total.

=== Skunk ===
Skunk (or Think) is a variation of Two-Dice Pig that is played with large groups. Rather than rolling in turn, all players begin the round standing. At any point in the round, a player may hold by sitting down. The round continues until a is rolled, or all players have sat down. Skunk is played in five rounds, and scoring is recorded in a five-column table with columns labeled with the letters of the word &quot;SKUNK&quot;. The first round score is entered in the &quot;S&quot;-column, the next in the first &quot;K&quot;-column, and so on. After five rounds, the highest-scoring player is the winner.

=== Hog ===
Hog is played with a larger number of dice. On a player&#x27;s turn, they choose any amount of dice to roll, and throw those dice. If they roll any &#x27;s, they score zero for their turn; otherwise they score the sum of the dice. Play then passes to the next player. The game continues to a target score.

===Pass the Pigs===

The commercial game &quot;Pass the Pigs&quot; is similar to two-dice Pig, and is played with two small model pigs being thrown, similar to &quot;shagai&quot; bones.

In this game, a roll of left side and right side has the same consequences as rolling a (i.e., the turn ends with the loss of the turn total), and a roll with pigs touching has the same consequences as rolling two &#x27;s (i.e., the turn ends with the loss of the turn total and score). &quot;Pass the Pigs&quot; is similar to Frey&#x27;s variant in that two pigs in the same non-side configuration score double what they would individually.

== Teaching ==
Pig often serves as a simple example for teaching probability concepts from the middle school level upwards. The game also provides exercises for teaching computer science in areas ranging from introductory courses to advanced machine learning material.

<text>The British ambassador to the United States is in charge of the British Embassy, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom&#x27;s diplomatic mission to the United States. The official title is His Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States of America.

The ambassador&#x27;s residence is on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and built in 1928.

== Duties ==
The position of ambassador to the United States is considered to be one of the most important and prestigious posts in His Majesty&#x27;s Diplomatic Service, along with that of Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.

The ambassador&#x27;s main duty is to present British policies to the American government and people, and to report American policies and views to the Government of the United Kingdom. They serve as the primary channel of communication between the two nations, and play an important role in treaty negotiations.

The ambassador is the head of the United Kingdom&#x27;s consular service in the United States. As well as directing diplomatic activity in support of trade, they are ultimately responsible for visa services and for the provision of consular support to British citizens in America. They also oversee cultural relations between the two countries.

== History ==
The first British envoy to the United States was Sir John Temple, who was appointed consul general in 1785 and was based in New York at the estate at Richmond Hill (Manhattan) which served previously as a headquarters for George Washington.

George Hammond was appointed on 5 July 1791. He held the title of Minister in Washington or Minister to the United States of America.

In 1809, David Erskine and President James Madison negotiated a compromise on Anglo-American disputes over shipping in the Atlantic, which might have averted the War of 1812. However, the deal was rejected by King George III and the British Government recalled Erskine.

By the 1850s, the envoy&#x27;s title was Her Majesty&#x27;s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States of America, and the United Kingdom had consulates in several American cities. Under the direction of Sir John Crampton in 1854 and 1855, British consuls attempted to enlist American volunteers to fight in the Crimean War. The American government strenuously objected, and President Franklin Pierce asked for Crampton to be recalled. The United Kingdom refused, and in May 1856 the American government dismissed Crampton, along with the United Kingdom&#x27;s consuls in New York, Philadelphia and Cincinnati. After much negotiation, the United Kingdom was allowed to re-establish its Legation in Washington the following year, and Lord Napier became the new minister.

In 1893, the British diplomatic mission in Washington was raised from a Legation to an Embassy, and Sir Julian Pauncefote, Minister since 1889, was appointed as the United Kingdom&#x27;s first ambassador to the United States, with the title Her Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States.

The role has in the past been offered to three former Prime Ministers: the Earl of Rosebery, David Lloyd George and Sir Edward Heath, all of whom declined.

==Heads of mission==

=== Minister plenipotentiary (1791–1795) ===

As a republic, the United States was not entitled to receive an ambassador. Instead, the United Kingdom dispatched a diplomat with the lower rank of &quot;minister plenipotentiary&quot;. This placed the United Kingdom on equal footing with France, which also maintained a minister plenipotentiary in the United States.

1791–1795: George Hammond

===Envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary (1796–1893)===

In 1796, the United Kingdom raised its representation to &quot;envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary&quot;, or &quot;minister&quot;. Diplomatic relations would be maintained at this rank for almost 100 years.

<doc id="611430" wikidata="Q1390829" url="?curid=611430" title="John Shore, 1st Baron Teignmouth">
<text>John Shore, 1st Baron Teignmouth (5 October 1751 – 14 February 1834) was a British official of the East India Company who served as Governor-General of Bengal from 1793 to 1798. In 1798 he was created Baron Teignmouth in the Peerage of Ireland. Shore was the first president of the British and Foreign Bible Society. A close friend of the orientalist Sir William Jones (1746–1794), Shore edited a memoir of Jones&#x27;s life in 1804, containing many of Jones&#x27;s letters.

==Early life==
Born in St. James&#x27;s Street, Piccadilly, on 5 October 1751, he was the elder son of Thomas Shore of Melton Place, near Romford, an East India Company employee, by his wife Dorothy, daughter of Captain Shepherd of the company&#x27;s naval service. At the age of fourteen Shore was sent to Harrow School. In his seventeenth year Shore was moved to a commercial school at Hoxton for the purpose of learning bookkeeping, to take up an opportunity made for him by the merchant Frederick Pigou, a family friend. Towards the close of 1768 he sailed for India as a writer in the East India Company&#x27;s service.

Soon after his arrival in Kolkata, then called Calcutta, in May 1769 Shore was appointed to the secret political department, in which he remained for about twelve months. In September 1770 he was nominated assistant to the board of revenue at Murshidabad. Shore at the age of 19 suddenly found himself invested with the civil and fiscal jurisdiction of a large district; he also studied languages.

In 1772 Shore went to Rajshahi as first assistant to the resident of the province. In the following year he acted temporarily as Persian translator and secretary to the board at Murshidabad. In June 1775 he was appointed a member of the revenue council at Calcutta. He continued to hold that post until the dissolution of the council at the close of 1780. Though he revised one of the bitter philippics launched by Philip Francis against Warren Hastings, and is said to have written one of the memorials against the supreme court and Sir Elijah Impey, he was appointed by the governor-general to a seat in the committee of revenue at Calcutta, which took the place of the provincial council.

==Revenue official==
Shore gained the confidence of Hastings by attention to his duties. Besides superintending the collection of the revenues, he devoted much of his time to the adjudication of exchequer cases. He acted as revenue commissioner in Dacca and Behar, and he drew up plans for judicial and financial reforms. Deploring the lavish profusion of the governor-general, Shore communicated his views of the financial situation to John Macpherson, who, instead of privately imparting them to Hastings, inserted them as a minute into the records of the Supreme Council. As a result of what was seen as a breach of confidence, Shore resigned his seat on the board.

In January 1785 Shore returned to England in the company of Hastings. While in England, on 14 February 1786 he married Charlotte, the only daughter of James Cornish, a medical practitioner at Teignmouth.

Having been appointed by the Court of Directors to a seat on the Supreme Council, Shore returned to India, and on 21 January 1787 he took his seat as a member of the government of Bengal. Many of the reforms instituted by Charles Cornwallis were attributable to Shore&#x27;s influence in the council. In the summer of 1789, Shore completed the ten-yearly settlement of the revenues of Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha. Though Shore recommended caution and further inquiry, and protested against rigidity, his decision in favour of the proprietary rights of the zamindars was ratified by Cornwallis and formed the basis of the much discussed Permanent Settlement.

In December 1789, Shore embarked for England, where he arrived in April 1790. He is said to have refused the offer of a baronetcy on the ground of &quot;the incompatibility of poverty and titles&quot;. On 2 June 1790 he was examined as a witness in the trial of Warren Hastings with regard to the transactions of the committee of revenue at Calcutta, and he testified to his friend&#x27;s popularity among the Indians.

==Governor-general==
Shore was appointed by the court of directors governor-general of India in succession to Cornwallis on 19 September 1792, and was created a baronet on 2 October following; Edmund Burke protested vainly. Shore embarked for India at the end of the month. On 10 March 1793 he arrived at Calcutta, where he remained without official employment or responsibility until the departure of Cornwallis. He succeeded to the government on 28 October 1793.

The period of Shore&#x27;s rule as governor-general was comparatively uneventful. His policy was attacked as temporising and timid. He acquiesced in the invasion by the Marathas of the dominions of Ali Khan Asaf Jah II, the Nizam of Hyderabad; he permitted the growth of a French subsidiary force in the service of more than one native power; he thwarted Lord Hobart&#x27;s efforts for extending the sphere of British influence; and he looked on while Tipu Sahib was preparing for war. In these matters Shore faithfully obeyed his instructions.

Though he showed weakness in dealing with the mutiny of the officers of the Bengal army, he boldly settled the question of the Oudh succession, when he substituted Saadat Ali Khan II for Wazir Ali Khan, albeit at the cost of the Massacre of Benares. As a reward for his services Shore was created Baron Teignmouth, of Teignmouth in the peerage of Ireland by letters patent executed at Dublin on 3 March 1798.

==Later life==
Resigning the government into the hands of Sir Alured Clarke, Teignmouth left India in March 1798. On 4 April 1807 he was appointed a member of the board of control, an office to which no salary was attached, and four days afterwards was sworn a member of the privy council. He occasionally transacted business at the board of control, or at the Cockpit, where as a privy councillor he sometimes decided Indian appeals with Sir William Grant and Sir John Nicholl. But he occupied the most of his time in religious and philanthropic matters, though he nominally remained a member of the board until February 1828.

Teignmouth never took his seat in the Irish House of Lords, nor was he elected a representative peer after the union. He was twice examined before the House of Commons on Indian affairs, on 18 June 1806 and on 30 March 1813. In consequence of the order of the House of Commons for Teignmouth&#x27;s attendance on the first occasion, the House of Lords on 19 July 1806 passed a resolution maintaining the privilege of peerage as apart from the privilege of parliament. This resolution, however, was not communicated to the Commons; and on the second occasion the order of the Commons for Teignmouth&#x27;s attendance was not questioned by the Lords.

Shore became a prominent member of the Clapham sect: from 1802 to 1808 he lived at Clapham. He then moved to London, where he passed the remainder of his days. He was elected the first president of the British and Foreign Bible Society on 14 May 1804, and held that office until the end of his life. He took an active part in the various controversies in the Society, and gave his decision in favour of the exclusion of the apocryphal books from all editions of the Bible issued by the society. He died at his house in Portman Square on 14 February 1834, aged 82, and was buried in Marylebone parish church, where a monument was erected to his memory.

Teignmouth was elected president of the Royal Society of Literature, but declined the office in favour of Bishop Burgess.

==Works==
Teignmouth was a close friend of Sir William Jones, whom he succeeded as president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal on 22 May 1794. On that occasion he delivered an address on the &#x27;Literary History&#x27; of his predecessor (London, 1795), which was frequently reprinted, and has been translated into Italian. Three of his contributions to the society are printed in &#x27;Asiatick Researches&#x27; (ii. 307–22, 383–7, iv. 331– 350). He translated in three manuscript volumes the Persian version of an abridgment of the &#x27;Jôg Bashurst,&#x27; but later destroyed them in consequence of the little encouragement which his translations of Persian versions of Hindu authors received. He wrote a number of articles for the &quot;Christian Observer&quot;, and the earlier annual reports of the Bible Society were written by him. He was also the author of some mediocre verse. He published:

* ‘Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Correspondence of Sir William Jones,’ London, 1804. This passed through several editions, and formed vols. i. and ii. of ‘The Works of Sir William Jones,’ which were edited by Lady Jones (London, 1807, 13 vols.)
* ‘Considerations on the Practicability, Policy, and Obligation of communicating to the Natives of India the Knowledge of Christianity. With Observations on he “Prefatory Remarks” to a pamphlet published by Major Scott Waring. By a late Resident in Bengal,’ London, 1808. Reply to John Scott-Waring.
* &#x27;A Letter to the Rev. Christopher Wordsworth, D.D., in reply to his Strictures on the British and Foreign Bible Society,&#x27; London, 1810.
* &#x27;Thoughts on the Providence of God,&#x27; London, 1834 (anon.)

A portrait of Teignmouth was painted by Arthur William Devis.

==Family==
Teignmouth had three sons and six daughters by his wife, who died on 13 July 1834. He was succeeded in the title by his eldest son, Charles John Shore. His second son, Frederick John, married Charlotte Mary Cornish of Devonshire in 1830. His second daughter, Anna Maria, married Sir Thomas Hill. Another daughter, Caroline Dorothea, married Rev. Robert Anderson (their eldest daughter, Florence Caroline, married Lord Alwyne Compton). Shore was great-uncle to the poet Louisa Catherine Shore.

<text>Yoddha: The Warrior, or simply Yodha () is a 1992 Indian Malayalam-language fantasy action film directed by Sangeeth Sivan and written by Sasidharan Arattuvazhi. Mohanlal plays the lead role of Thaiparambil Ashokan, the saviour destined to rescue the Rimpoche of a Nepalese Buddhist monastery from sorcerers practicing black magic. The ensemble supporting cast include Siddharth Lama, Jagathy Sreekumar, Puneet Issar, Madhoo and Urvashi.

The original songs and background score were composed by A. R. Rahman. Santosh Sivan was the cinematographer and A. Sreekar Prasad edited the film. Saga Films produced and distributed the film. &quot;Yoddha&quot; was released in India on 3 September 1992. The film was inspired from the Hollywood films, The Golden Child and Blind Fury. It was later dubbed and released in other regional Indian languages&quot;Dharam Yoddha&quot; (1997) in Hindi, &quot;Ashokan&quot; (1993) in Tamil, and &quot;Yoddha&quot; (1993) in Telugu. The film won four Kerala State Film Awards for Best Child Artist (Lama), Best Editor (Prasad), Best Sound Recordist (Arun K. Bose), and Best Male Singer (M. G. Sreekumar).

== Plot ==
In an unknown location on the Himalayan Nepal, a mystical boy is about to be crowned the Rimpoche of a Buddhist monastery when a gang of sorcerers, led by Vishaka, abduct the child. Vishaka is in service to a mysterious enchantress, who needs to make a human sacrifice of the Rimpoche before the solar eclipse to attain invincibility. The monks expect the advent of a saviour, the man with ears as a weapon, across the Himalayas to rescue the child as they are prophesied. In the meantime, Rimpoche manages to escape through the course and reaches Kathmandu.

At the other end of the subcontinent, in a village in Kerala, Ashokan, a youngster spends his time competing with his cousin, Appukuttan, in local games and other shenanigans. Appukuttan is also having doubts that his fiance Dhamayanthi prefers Ashokan over him. After a palm reader predicts that he will commit murder if he stays in Kerala, Ashokan is sent to his uncle Capt. Kuttikrishna Menon a.k.a Kuttimama in Nepal by his mother. Unbeknownst to Ashokan, Appukuttan flees to Nepal beforehand and masquerades as Ashokan before their uncle. Once Ashokan reaches Nepal, in unforeseen circumstances loses his luggage and while he reaches his uncle&#x27;s home he is cast out assuming he is a con artist as Appukuttan disguises as Ashokan is already there. In the streets, he meets the boy and forms a bond with him and names him Unnikuttan.

Kuttimama&#x27;s daughter, Aswathi, is a researcher in Nepalese traditions and history. As a payback to Ashokan, Appukuttan attempts to plot his way into marrying her, who in turn is Ashokan&#x27;s bride-to-be by their custom, but not engaged. Ashokan, with Unnikuttan&#x27;s (as he calls the boy) assistance, manages to cast doubt into the mind of his uncle about the credibility of Appukuttan&#x27;s claims and wins over Aswathi&#x27;s love and trust.

Ashokan and Aswathi witness one of the sorcerers&#x27; confederate combatants kidnapping the boy. Upon following him into a forest, they end up confronting Vishaka. In an ensuing fight, Vishaka grievously wounds Aswathi, blinds Ashokan using a substance, and leaves the two to die. Ashokan is rescued by a tribe affiliated with the monks that train warriors tasked with protecting the monastery. Ashokan is discovered as the &quot;chosen one&quot; and is given training in Kung Fu and martial arts, to overcome his blindness and enhance his hearing skills. At the same time, Appukuttan was also captured by another evil tribe while following the two.

Ashokan, now enlisted as a warrior, infiltrates the sorcerer&#x27;s location and rescues Unnikuttan from a bewitched sheathe. The boy then, aided by an ailing old monk, restores Ashokan&#x27;s eyesight. As the solar eclipse nears, the monks begin the coronation ceremony of the boy. Vishaka rushes to the monastery to terminate it. But Ashokan stands in his way and, in a climactic fight, kills him. The boy is crowned as the Rimpoche. Ashokan discovers that Aswathi was indeed saved by tribes and is alive and healthy. Appukuttan returns as Ashokan-esque trained warrior, but before he could stand a chance, he is subdued by Ashokan in a friendly manner.

==Production==
Siddharth Lama debuted in the film playing Rimpoche. His father Yubaraj Lama also acted in the film as the long-haired henchman, an abductor sent by Puneet Issar&#x27;s villain character. Cinematographer Santhosh Sivan found Siddharth Lama accidentally, who happened to see him when he visited actor Yubaraj Lama. At the time, they were searching for a suitable child actor to play the role of Rimpoche. Sivan invited &quot;little&quot; Lama to the film, who without hesitation said, yes. While filming, Lama shaved his head at least 20 times for the film. Every three days he had to shave.

Ashokan&#x27;s arrival scene at the Nepal airport was shot at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The house shown in the film as the residence of Kuttymama in Nepal was originally a hotel named Astoria (it was since then converted into a school). The Swayambhu architecture situated atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley was a significant filming location. Some of the comedy scenes between Mohanlal and Jagathy Sreekumar were shot on its steps elevating to the Buddha statue. The jacket worn by Mohanlal in the scenes shot in Nepal was an indigenous fashion at the time, called the Butterfly Jacket. Some sequences were filmed inside a cave called the Bat Cave in Pokhara, a tourist attraction. Baring a few scenes shot in Palakkad, the film was completely shot in Nepal.

==Music==

The film&#x27;s original songs and background score were composed by A. R. Rahman; the lyrics for the songs were by Bichu Thirumala. &quot;Yoddha&quot; was the second film of Rahman after &quot;Roja&quot; (1992). He was working on &quot;Roja&quot; when he signed &quot;Yoddha&quot;. Rahman had already attained fame across South India for composing successful jingles for advertisement films and was then known by the name Dileep. Sangeeth decided to experiment with Rahman as the composer and was impressed with Rahman&#x27;s musical arrangement for a candy commercial he directed. He also liked Rahman&#x27;s composition of &quot;Chinna Chinna Asai&quot; for &quot;Roja&quot;, which Rahman showed him while he was in his studio.

The song &quot;Padakaali&quot; is featured in the backdrop of a singing competition between Ashokan and Appukuttan in a temple, with both of them dissing each other with words. The song&#x27;s situation in the story was briefed to lyricist Thirumala by Sivan while they were in Rahman&#x27;s Panchathan Record Inn studio in Chennai. After hearing it, Hindu goddess Kali&#x27;s image was the first thing that came into his mind. He thought that a hymn describing Kali&#x27;s furious persona would suit the situation. He referred to the book &quot;Mahakshetrangalude Munnil&quot; by Nalankal Krishna Pillai for reference, from which he got words such as &quot;padakali&quot;, &quot;porkali&quot;, &quot;chandi&quot;, &quot;maargini&quot; among others, to use in the lyrics. &quot;Padakali&quot; and &quot;chandi&quot; are synonyms for goddess Kali. Since it was a comical song, it was not expected to have deep words, though Thirumala was particular that the words should not be meaningless, and most of the words he added were related to religious worship. It is one of the all-time popular songs in Malayalam film music.

Apart from the original Malayalam version, the soundtrack was also released in Tamil (as &quot;Asokan&quot;), Hindi (as &quot;Dharam Yoddha&quot;), and Telugu (as &quot;Yoddha&quot;). The respective soundtracks featured versions of all songs except &quot;Mamboove&quot; which was not featured in the film. &quot;Mamboove&quot; was later reused for the Tamil movie &quot;Pavithra&quot; as &quot;Sevvanam&quot;. The lyrics were written by Vairamuthu, P. K. Mishra, and Veturi respectively for the Tamil, Hindi, and Telugu versions. The Hindi version was added with five songs composed by Pappu Khan, none of which was featured in the film. The original soundtrack was released by Tharangini in 1992. The Tamil dubbed version, &quot;Asokan&quot; by Pyramid was released in 1994, the Hindi version by BMG Crescendo in 1996, and the Telugu version in 1995. The Hindi version was re-released in 1997 with five new songs added.

<doc id="611433" wikidata="Q3567786" url="?curid=611433" title="White River (Puyallup River)">
<text>The White River is a white, glacial river in the U.S. state of Washington. It flows about 75 miles (121 km) from its source, the Emmons Glacier on Mount Rainier, to join the Puyallup River at Sumner. It defines part of the boundary between King and Pierce counties.

==Course==

The source of the White River is the Emmons Glacier on the northeast side of Mount Rainier. The river flows from ice caves at the toe of the glacier. Its upper reach is contained within Mount Rainier National Park. Shortly after emerging from the Emmons Glacier, the White River flows generally east, by the White River Campground, then the White River Ranger Station, after which it turns north. The river is paralleled by much of its upper course by State Route 410, called the Mather Memorial Parkway in the national park. After several miles the river exits Mount Rainier National Park and enters Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.

The river turns gradually westward, passing several national forest campgrounds. Huckleberry Creek joins just below The Dalles Campground. Several miles downriver from there the White River is joined by one of its main tributaries, the West Fork White River, which also originates at a glacier in Mount Rainier National Park, in this case, Winthrop Glacier. A few miles downriver from the West Fork confluence another major tributary joins, the Greenwater River. The small settlement of Greenwater is located at the confluence.

Below Greenwater, the White River flows generally west. It passes Federation Forest State Park and is then joined by another tributary, the Clearwater River. Several miles downriver from there the White River is impounded by Mud Mountain Dam, which creates a marshy intermittent lake called Mud Mountain Lake. The dam was built for flood control purposes. Mud Mountain Lake only fills with water during conditions of exceptionally high stream flow.
Below Mud Mountain Dam the White River enters the greater Tacoma metropolitan area. It flows between the cities of Buckley and Enumclaw, after which it makes a large bend northwest and then southwest, essentially flowing around Lake Tapps. North of the lake, the White River flows through the Muckleshoot Indian Reservation. Below that, to the west of Lake Tapps, the White River enters a broad floodplain and flows past the city of Pacific before emptying into the Puyallup River at Sumner.

Lake Tapps is a reservoir created in 1911 for hydroelectric purposes. A diversion dam near Buckley taps the White River&#x27;s water, sending a portion of it through a flume, a canal, and a pipeline to Lake Tapps. An outlet canal on the west side of the lake routes water through the turbines of the Dieringer Powerhouse, after which the water is returned to the lower White River (or Stuck River as it is locally called in this area) via the Dieringer &quot;tailrace&quot;.

==River modifications==
Before 1906, the White River joined the Green River near Auburn, and the combined river (under the name &quot;White&quot;) joined the Black River at Tukwila, forming the Duwamish River, which emptied into Elliott Bay at Seattle. In 1906, a great flood coupled with a large log and debris jam diverted the White River southward into the Stuck River thence into the Puyallup River, which empties into Commencement Bay at Tacoma. The debris dam was replaced with a permanent diversion wall. Thus the White River remains a tributary of the Puyallup River today.

In the late 19th century farmers along the White River were subjected to nearly annual floods. Sometimes farmers would use dynamite to divert the river into different channels. In 1899 one such explosion went awry and ended up diverting most of the White River into the Stuck River, thence the Puyallup. Dynamiting the river channels continued until the major flood of 1906 which ended up sending the entire White River down the Stuck River. Because of the risk of floods, the diversion was not wanted by Pierce County, which sued King County in an attempt to have the White River rediverted away from the Stuck River. The lawsuit dragged on for years until 1913 when the two counties reached an agreement. Pierce County would keep the White River, but King County would pay 60% of the cost of flood control. Dams, levees, and barriers were built along the White River in hopes of preventing major flooding, but in 1933 a large flood inundated the region. The two counties realized they were unable to tame the river and so turned to the federal government. The result was Mud Mountain Dam.

Mud Mountain Dam, built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers for flood control purposes, was completed in 1948. The dam blocks anadromous fish passage, so a &quot;trap and haul&quot; system is used, in which fish are transported around the dam by truck. After Mud Mountain Dam was built, the farmers of the lower White River were freed from the previously near-constant worry about flooding.

In 1911 a diversion dam was built near Buckley which, along with a system of dikes around the originally small Lake Tapps, created a larger reservoir. Over the years a small community has developed around the lake. The reservoir&#x27;s water is returned to the White River about 20 miles (32 km) downstream from the diversion dam. Ownership and operation was transferred to Puget Sound Energy. Recently, Puget Sound Energy sold the lake to Cascade Water Alliance (CWA). CWA is currently undergoing environmental studies intending to use the lake as a drinking water source. The lake has also been the focus of water quality issues through a planning process identified in the Pierce County &quot;White River Basin Plan&quot;, adopted November 26, 2013.

==Natural history==
The White River and its tributaries provide habitat for salmon species including chinook, pink, chum, and coho salmon, as well as bull, rainbow, steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Pink and chum salmon dominate the runs. Although no large natural lakes occur in the basin, sockeye salmon are also present in very small numbers. The White River coho salmon are a mixed population of hatchery and wild fish. The Puget Sound chinook salmon evolutionary significant unit (2005), the Puget Sound steelhead distinct population segment (2011), and Puget Sound/Coastal bull trout (1998) are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

==History==
The White River valley was the scene of violent clashes between Native Americans and the militias of Washington Territory as well as the U.S. Army during the Puget Sound War of 1855-1856. Volunteer US troops were ambushed while on their way to work on a construction project near a ferry across the river in the last altercation in the war.

<doc id="611440" wikidata="Q2469989" url="?curid=611440" title="Military courtesy">
<text>Military courtesy is one of the defining features of a military force. The courtesies form a strict and sometimes elaborate code of conduct.
It is an extension and a formalization of courtesies practiced in a culture&#x27;s everyday life. It is intended to reinforce military discipline and the chain of command by defining how soldiers will treat their superiors and vice versa. They are also thought to enhance esprit de corps.

Some military courtesies include proper forms of address (&quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;, &quot;Mister&quot;) and when each should be used; the salute and the related concept of standing at attention; proper wear of military headgear; obeisance; and the rules for behavior in various ceremonies. Specifics can vary depending on an individual&#x27;s rank, location, and circumstances. A military funeral, for example, requires stricter etiquette than on a normal day. Courtesies are sometimes relaxed under battlefield conditions; officers may discourage salutes in combat areas to avoid making themselves a target for snipers. In the United States of America as well as some Commonwealth nations, it is forbidden to salute both indoors and in &quot;the field,&quot; as snipers are likely to pick out officer targets watching for salutes.

There are military customs that have specific purposes. In the United States Navy, &quot;bracing&quot; is the practice of bracing one&#x27;s self against the bulkhead (wall) at the position of attention as a superior officer walks by.
The practice arose because of the narrow passageways on ships. Since officers may need to quickly move about the ship, sailors would get out of the officer&#x27;s way by bracing. The tradition has extended to include the corridors and hallways of buildings (depending on the situation), and it is mostly an obeisance, but it still serves a useful purpose aboard ships (especially submarines).

According to Field Manual 7-21.13 4-4:&quot;Courtesy among members of the Armed Forces is vital to maintain military discipline. Military courtesy means good manners and politeness in dealing with other people. Courteous behavior provides a basis for developing good human relations. The distinction between civilian and military courtesy is that military courtesy was developed in a military atmosphere and has become an integral part of serving in uniform.&quot; 
Military courtesy has been established, over the years, to establish and maintain order and structure that is the backbone of the military.

Military courtesies may also be adopted by paramilitary organizations.

<doc id="611442" wikidata="Q2756444" url="?curid=611442" title="Brighton, Tasmania">
<text>Brighton is a suburb 27 km north of Hobart, in Tasmania, Australia. It is between Pontville and the outer Hobart suburb of Bridgewater on the Midland Highway. At the 2021 census, Brighton had a population of 4,983.

==History==
Prior to European settlement in Tasmania, Brighton was in the upper reaches of the home lands of the Moomairremener people, a band of the Oyster Bay Tribe.

From 1826 onwards, the township was the site of the Brighton Barracks, a military accommodation facility until sold off for subdivision in the early 2000s.

A Brighton Post Office opened on 1 June 1832. This was renamed &quot;Pontville&quot; in 1895 and closed in 1973. The current Brighton office opened on 22 May 1964.

A 42 kilometre railway line operated from Brighton to Aspley, commencing operations in 1891. Passenger services ended in 1927, and the goods service was replaced by trucks in 1947, with the line being removed shortly thereafter.

More recently it was used as emergency accommodation for refugees fleeing the conflicts in eastern Europe, namely Kosovo.

The area surrounding Brighton was swept with bush and grass fires over the summer of January 2003 with fires reaching Cartwright street, the old army camp and the Midland highway placing the town under extreme threat.

The Brighton area expected to see an increase in light industrial use, being serviced by both road and rail with the construction of the Brighton Transport Hub.

== Climate ==
Brighton has an subtropical desert climate (Köppen: Cfb), with tepid summers and cool winters. Average maxima vary between in January and in July while average minima fluctuate between in January and in July. The mean annual precipitation is somewhat low, , though well-distributed across the year, occurring within 153.0 precipitation days. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 4 January 2013 to on 13 September 2013. Climate data was sourced from Campania, a township east-northeast of Brighton.

==Brighton Training Centre==
The area is also the site of a major horse racing training facility located at Brighton Racecourse known as the Brighton Training Centre, serving the thoroughbred, trotting and pacing industry.

Many good Tasmanian Thoroughbreds and Pacers have been trained at Brighton Racecourse since the early eighties including the 1986 Launceston Cup winner Epigram and Noble Sensation winner of the TRC Tasmanian Breeders Classic (LR), Thos Lyons S. (LR), TTC Gold Sovereign S. (LR), George Adams P. (LR); 2d TRC Tattersalls S. (LR), TTC Newmarket H. (LR), 3d VATC Autumn S. (G3), TTC Tasmanian Gns (LR), TRC Thomas Lyons S. (LR), Tattersall&#x27;s S. (LR).

The Training centre is located north of the town centre on Racecourse Road. The original course proper was 2000 metres from start to finish and was home of the Brighton Cup until the racecourse was closed for training use only in 1973.

The course has undergone significant changes since the 1980s when a chipwood track was put in on the outer half of the course proper and a major redevelopment in late 2004 to become the present training centre with all training of horses ceasing at Elwick Racecourse along with the relocation of Elwick-based trainers to stables built along the back straight of the track.

<text>The Stuck River in Washington state is a former small stream turned distributary and later final course of the White River, near Auburn to the Puyallup River at Sumner. The river&#x27;s name comes from the Lushootseed word &quot;/stéq/&quot;, &quot;log jam&quot;, or &quot;/stəx̣/&quot;, &quot;gouged through&quot;, or &quot;plowed through&quot;.

Throughout the late 19th century, farmers in the valley attempted various flood control efforts that eventually allowed the White River to partially flow into the Stuck River in 1899. In 1906, a great flood diverted the White River&#x27;s entire flow into the Stuck River. The entire length of the former Stuck is now considered the final reach of the White River, though the Stuck River name still appears on many maps, in local place names, and in legal descriptions of property near the river.

<doc id="611449" wikidata="Q510766" url="?curid=611449" title="Common ground dove">
<text>The common ground dove (Columbina passerina) is a small bird that inhabits the southern United States, parts of Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. It is considered to be the smallest dove that inhabits the United States. As its name suggests, the bird spends the majority of its time on the ground walking but still has the ability to fly.

==Taxonomy==
The common ground dove was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758, in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Columba passerina&quot;. The specific name &quot;passerina&quot; is from the Latin &quot;passerinus&quot; meaning &quot;sparrow-like&quot;. The species is now placed with other New World ground-doves in the genus &quot;Columbina&quot; that was introduced in 1825, by the German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix. There are nine species in this genus including the Inca dove (&quot;Columbina inca&quot;) and the scaled dove (&quot;Columbina squammata&quot;).

There are 17 recognised subspecies:
*&quot;C. p. passerina&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – the nominate subspecies, southeastern United States
*&quot;C. p. pallescens&quot; (Baird, 1860) – southwest United States. Males are paler and females have more white on their underbelly.
*&quot;C. p. socorroensis&quot; (Ridgway, 1887) – Socorro Island, Mexico. They are darker brown than &quot;C. p. pallescens&quot; and have shorter wings as well.
*&quot;C. p. neglecta&quot; (Carriker, 1910) – Central America, from Honduras to Panama. They have darker feathers then &quot;C. p. pallescens&quot;.
*&quot;C. p. bahamensis&quot; (Maynard, 1887) – Bermuda and most of the Bahamas
*&quot;C. p. exigua&quot; (Riley, 1905) – Great Inagua Island (south Bahamas), Mona Island, Puerto Rico
*&quot;C. p. insularis&quot; (Ridgway, 1888) – Cuba, the Cayman Islands and Hispaniola (both the Dominican Republic and Haiti). Both its back and chest are darker than &quot;C. p. bahamensis&quot;.
*&quot;C. p. umbrina&quot; Buden, 1985 – Ile de la Tortue, Haiti. Darker on the back, and the bottom part of their beak is darker.
*&quot;C. p. jamaicensis&quot; (Maynard, 1899) – Jamaica; has a pale beak with males being very dark on the underbelly.
*&quot;C. p. portoricensis&quot; (Lowe, 1908) – Puerto Rico (except Mona Island) and the Virgin Islands (except St Croix). Similar to &quot;C. p. nigrirostris&quot; but the lower part of the beak is red.
*&quot;C. p. nigrirostris&quot; (Danforth, 1935) – northern Lesser Antilles, St. Croix in the Virgin Islands.
*&quot;C. p. trochila&quot; (Bonaparte, 1855) – Martinique. These birds have a greyish-green colouration on their chest and have chestnut tail feathers.
*&quot;C. p. antillarum&quot; (Lowe, 1908) – southern Lesser Antilles
*&quot;C. p. aflavida&quot; (Palmer and Riley, 1902) – north Colombia, north Venezuela, Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad. These doves are larger than usual, with males having darker brown underparts. Also, both males and females have darker bills.
*&quot;C. p. parvula&quot; (Todd, 1913) – central Colombia
*&quot;C. p. nana&quot; (Todd, 1913) – west Colombia
*&quot;C. p. quitensis&quot; (Todd, 1913) – central Ecuador

==Description==
The common ground dove is North America&#x27;s smallest and one of the world&#x27;s smallest by mass. This species ranges from in length, spans across the wings, and weighs . The common ground dove has a yellow beak with a black tip. Feathers surrounding the beak are pink in colour. The feathers on the head and the upper breast have a scale-like appearance. The tail feathers are very short and similar colour to the back. The plumage on the back of the bird is brown. The coverts and wing feathers are also brown but have black spotting on them. The common ground dove has chestnut primaries and wing borders, which can only be seen when the bird is flying. The common ground dove shows some sexual dimorphism in their plumage. The males have slate-gray feathers on the top of their heads and pink-gray colouration on their bellies. Females, on the other hand, are grayer than their male counterparts and are more evenly coloured.

The common ground dove&#x27;s call can be described as soft whoops that increase in pitch. Often the call is heard in repetition and is quite distinct. To hear the call of the common ground dove, see the external links for a link to a website.

==Distribution and habitat==

It is found in the southern tip of the United States, most of Mexico, parts of Central America, the Caribbean islands and northwestern South America. The common ground dove does not migrate and is a year-long resident in the areas they are found.

The common ground dove lives in open areas that have trees and bushes. They are also found in forests with sandy areas, farmlands, and savannahs and near human infrastructure. Common ground doves seem to hold territories but they are rarely aggressive when dealing with intruders.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
The common ground dove is a ground gleaner; as such it forages on the ground feeding on vegetation, seeds and fruits. It can also feed on insects and snails (including the shells), and will feed from bird feeders if available to them. They often eat while they are still moving and searching for other food items. Common ground doves can suck water into their beak and swallow it by lifting their heads, which is a common feature shared with other members of its family.

===Breeding===
The common ground dove mates with its partner for life. They build nests on the ground in vegetation or sometimes slightly off the ground in bushes. Their nests are quite simple, usually just a slight groove in the ground surrounded with plant material in a simple manner. The nests in bushes often are a simple structure of twigs and vegetation that are often fragile. They can become sexually active within 79 days after hatching. Nesting can occur between February and October; however, the peak of nesting occurs between early April and mid May. They can have 2–3 broods in any given year. On average, two white eggs are laid that are incubated by both parents for 12–14 days. The hatchlings are altricial at birth and covered in a small amount of gray down feathers. The young birds can fledge in 11 days. Both parents feed the young birds until they are ready to feed themselves.

<doc id="611453" wikidata="Q440404" url="?curid=611453" title="Sir George Barlow, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir George Hilaro Barlow, 1st Baronet, (20 January 1763 – 18 December 1846) served as Acting Governor-General of India from the death of Lord Cornwallis in 1805 until the arrival of Lord Minto in 1807.

==Career==

He was appointed to the Bengal Civil Service in 1778, and in 1788 carried into execution the permanent settlement of Bengal.

When the Marquess of Cornwallis died in 1805, Sir George Barlow was nominated provisional governor-general, and his passion for economy and retrenchment in that capacity has caused him to be known as the only governor-general who diminished the area of British territory; but his nomination was rejected by the home government, and Lord Minto was appointed. Subsequently, Barlow was created governor of Madras, where his want of tact caused a mutiny of the British officers of the Madras Army in 1809, similar to that which had previously occurred under Clive. The main cause of the discontent was the abolition of certain purchase contracts for camping equipment which involved some money being embezzled by the officers. In 1812 he was recalled, and lived in retirement until his death in Farnham, Surrey, in December 1846.

He was created a baronet in 1803. In October 1806 he was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath (KB), which on the reconstitution of the Order in 1815 became Knight Grand Cross (GCB).

He was portrayed in a bust by Bertel Thorvaldsen when he visited the sculptor in Rome Spring 1828.

==Personal life==

He married Elizabeth, daughter of Burton Smith, in Calcutta on 16 April 1789 and had fifteen children. In 1815, he discovered that one of these had in fact been fathered by George Pratt Barlow, a young kinsman whom he had admitted to his household in India in 1803. The marriage was dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1816.

He hosted the Canadian game show &quot;First Impressions&quot; on the CTV network during the 1976–77 season, taped at CFCF-TV in Montreal, the Saturday morning celebrity game show &quot;Animal Crack-Ups&quot; in the late 1980s, and, in 1997, a television version of the board game &quot;Pictionary&quot;. In the early 2000s, he hosted the &quot;All New 3&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; on the Game Show Network.

====Talk shows====
Norman Lear hired Thicke to produce and head the writing staff of &quot;Fernwood 2 Night&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek talk show based on characters from Lear&#x27;s earlier show, &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;. In the late 1970s, he was a frequent guest host of &quot;The Alan Hamel Show&quot;, a popular daytime talk show on Canadian TV, usually hosted by Alan Hamel. When the Hamel series ended in the early 1980s, it was replaced by &quot;The Alan Thicke Show&quot;. The show at one point spawned a prime-time spinoff, &quot;Prime Cuts&quot;, which consisted of edited highlights from the talk show.

Thicke was later signed to do a US syndicated late-night talk show, &quot;Thicke of the Night&quot;, for the 1983–1984 TV season. Heavily promoted prior to broadcast as a competitor to NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;Thicke of the Night&quot; was short-lived.

===Producing and composing===
Thicke had a successful career as a TV theme song composer, often collaborating with his then-wife Gloria Loring on these projects, which included the themes to the popular sitcoms &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. He also wrote a number of TV game show themes, including &quot;The Wizard of Odds&quot; (for which he also sang the vocal introduction), &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Sweepstakes&quot;, &quot;The Diamond Head Game&quot;, &quot;Animal Crack-Ups&quot; (which he co-wrote with his brother Todd Thicke and Gary Pickus), &quot;Blank Check&quot;, &quot;Stumpers!&quot; &quot;Whew!&quot; and the original theme to &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Thicke was a popular songwriter. He co-wrote &quot;Sara&quot;, a solo hit for Bill Champlin and included on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Runaway&quot; album (1981).

Thicke produced a variety of television shows, including Anne Murray Christmas specials for the CBC, beginning in the late 1970s.

===&quot;Growing Pains&quot;===
Thicke became well known when he played Jason Seaver, a psychiatrist and father, on the family sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. When the show began, Jason was moving his psychiatry practice into the home to be closer to the family&#x27;s children while the family matriarch Maggie, played by Joanna Kerns, resumed her career as a reporter. &quot;Growing Pains&quot; debuted on ABC in 1985 and ran until 1992. For his role, Thicke was nominated for a Golden Globe award in 1988.

Thicke reprised his role in two reunion TV movies, &quot;The Growing Pains Movie&quot; (2000) and &quot;Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers&quot; (2004).

===Television and film appearances===

Thicke co-hosted the Walt Disney World Very Merry Christmas Parade (now the Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade) with Joan Lunden from 1983 to 1990, when he was succeeded by Regis Philbin. Thicke also hosted the 1987 and 1988 Crystal Light National Aerobic Championships.

In 1987, Thicke appeared as Dr. Jonas Carson, who creates an android that looks just like a human teenage boy (played by Jay Underwood), and he &quot;adopts&quot; him as his son in the Disney Channel film &quot;Not Quite Human&quot;. Thicke reprised his role as Jonas Carson in two sequels, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Not Quite Human II&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Still Not Quite Human&quot;.

In 1988, he hosted the Miss USA Pageant in El Paso, Texas, replacing Bob Barker (who quit over fur being involved in the pageants). He replaced Barker again as host of the 1988 Miss Universe Pageant (along with Tracy Scoggins) in Taipei, Taiwan. Thicke was replaced by Dick Clark as host of the 1989 Miss USA Pageant in Mobile, Alabama and by John Forsythe as host of the 1989 Miss Universe Pageant in Cancún, Mexico.

Thicke continued to host a wide range of variety TV events. In 1989, he co-hosted with SCTV alumna Andrea Martin the TV special &quot;Opening of SkyDome&quot; in Toronto, which aired across Canada on the CBC. In 2004, he hosted the Miss Universe Canada Pageant in Ontario.

In 1992, Thicke appeared as himself in the pilot episode of the sitcom &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;. He appeared in the end-credits scene, alongside series star Mark Curry, humorously referencing the pilot episode being filmed on the same set used as the Seavers&#x27; home on &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. He also made guest appearances on shows such as &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Son of the Beach&quot; and &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

From 1995 to 1996, Thicke appeared on the American television series &quot;Hope &amp; Gloria&quot;, which ran for 35 episodes. In March 2002, Thicke participated in a celebrity version of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. In May 2002, he appeared in the season six finale of &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot;, &quot;The Boys in the Band.&quot; From 2006 to 2009, Thicke was talk show host Rich Ginger on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful.&quot;

From 2001 to 2003, Thicke hosted &quot;Animal Miracles&quot; on the Pax TV network. In April 2006, he hosted &quot;Celebrity Cooking Showdown&quot; on NBC, in which celebrities were teamed with famous chefs in a cooking competition.

====Later appearances====
In 2008, Thicke appeared in a major supporting role as Jim Jarlewski in the television series adaptation of Douglas Coupland&#x27;s &quot;jPod&quot;. That same year, he had a cameo appearance in the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;Sandcastles in the Sand&quot; as the dad in Robin Scherbatsky&#x27;s second &quot;Robin Sparkles&quot; music video. He guest starred as himself in the episodes &quot;The Rough Patch&quot;, &quot;Glitter&quot;, &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, and &quot;The Rehearsal Dinner&quot;.

In February 2009, Thicke made guest appearances on Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job&quot;. and the web series &quot;Star-ving&quot;. He also had a role in the 2009 film, &quot;The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard&quot;. On 10 July 2009, Alan appeared on the 1000th episode of &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;, singing with Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn, kissing Olivia on lips in the end of the skit.

Thicke made a guest appearance on a few episodes of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Worst Handyman 5&quot;. In January 2010, Thicke appeared on the television program, &quot;Tosh.0&quot;. In March 2010, he made an appearance in &quot;La La Land&quot; as himself. In October 2010, he appeared as a celebrity contestant on &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics&quot;, where he played for the charities ProCon.org and the Alan Thicke Center for diabetes research.

In March 2013, he participated on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;. He swapped wives with comedian Gilbert Gottfried. From 2014 to 2015, Thicke starred in his own reality series, &quot;Unusually Thicke&quot;, which aired on Pop.

In October 2016, Thicke appeared as himself in the pilot episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;This is Us&quot;.

====Other hosting====
During 2014 and 2015 Thicke hosted a travelling dance show &quot;Dancing Pros Live&quot; which toured the United States.

====Commercials====
In the 1990s, Thicke was the spokesman for the Canadian division of Woolco department stores until its demise in 1994. In 2007, Thicke appeared in a television ad for Tahiti Village, a Las Vegas time-share resort. In 2009, Thicke began appearing in TV ads endorsing CCS Medical, a distributor of home-delivered diabetes supplies. In 2014, he began representing Optima Tax Relief.

From 2011, Thicke was the spokesperson for Cambridge Life Solutions, a Canadian company that promised to reduce unsecured consumer debt through a method known as debt settlement, which had been outlawed in the United States by the Federal Trade Commission as a predatory practice in 2010 and was subsequently banned in Ontario in 2015. According to Scott Hannah, the president and CEO of the Credit Counseling Society of Canada, the company, which was accused of &quot;bilking thousands of vulnerable Canadians&quot; eventually dominated half of the Canadian market due to Thicke&#x27;s hiring &quot;as a spokesman who was very credible to Canadians.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Thicke was married three times: His first marriage, to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; actress Gloria Loring, lasted from 1970 until 1984; they had two sons, Brennan and Robin. In 1987 at the age of 40, Thicke began dating 17-year old Kristy Swanson. Two years later, they were engaged but never married. He married his second wife, Miss World 1990 Gina Tolleson, on 13 August 1994, and had a son, Carter William Thicke, before their divorce was finalized on 29 September 1999. In 1999, he met Tanya Callau in Miami, where he was a celebrity host and she was a model. They were married from 2005 until his death.

Thicke lent his name and star power to supporting the Alan Thicke Center for diabetes research. Also, for several years in the mid-1980s, Thicke and Gloria Loring were co-hosts of Telemiracle, an annual 20-hour telethon that alternated between Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewan, to support programs run by the Kinsmen Club.

==Death==
On 13 December 2016, Thicke collapsed while playing ice hockey with his son Carter at Pickwick Gardens in Burbank, California. The manager of the rink said he was talking and even joked to his son to take a photo as he was being wheeled out on a stretcher. Thicke died later that day of type-A aortic dissection at the Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, at age 69. On 19 December 2016, the cast of &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, including Leonardo DiCaprio, reunited at Thicke&#x27;s funeral; a eulogy was given by his friend Bob Saget, and his son, Robin, offered a humorous remembrance. He was buried at Santa Barbara Cemetery in Santa Barbara, California.

<text>Mambo (formerly named Mambo Open Source or MOS) was a free software/open source content management system (CMS) for creating and managing websites through a simple web interface. Its last release was in 2008, by which time all of the developers had left for forks of the project, mainly Joomla and MiaCMS.

==Features==
Mambo included features such as page caching to improve performance on busy sites, advanced templating techniques, and a fairly robust API. It could provide RSS feeds and automate many tasks, including web indexing of static pages.

Interface features included printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, forums, polls, calendars, website searching, language internationalization, and others.

== Timeline ==

* 2000: Miro Construct Pty Ltd, registered in March 2000 in Melbourne, and headed up by CEO Peter Lamont and Junio Souza Martins, a former advertising executive, starts development of Mambo, a closed-source, proprietary content management system.
* 2001: The company adopted a dual licensing policy, releasing Mambo Site Server under the GPL on SourceForge in April 2001.
* May 2001: The mamboserver.com domain name is registered.
* From this time until the middle of 2002, Miro was the only developer of Mambo, contributing bug-fixes and security patches but not really extending the code or adding to the feature sets.
* 2002: Miro releases the commercial CMS called Mambo 2002.
* With version 3.0.x, the open source Mambo Site Server becomes &quot;Mambo Open Source&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;MOS&quot;).
* Robert Castley becomes Project Director of Mambo Open Source.
* By the end of 2002, Robert Castley had pulled together a volunteer team of developers.
* Mambo Open Source 4.0 is released.
* 2003: Early in 2003, Miro hands off the responsibility of the code fully to the Open Source project Development Team.
* Miro concentrates on its commercial products and Mambo Open Source builds momentum under the leadership of Robert Castley.
* Miro released Mambo CMS, a commercial version of Mambo Open Source. Miro claims that Mambo CMS does not contain any source added to Mambo after it was made open source.
* Miro Construct Pty Ltd goes into voluntary liquidation in February 2003 and in August, Miro International Pty Ltd is formed. Source code for Mambo Open Source shows copyright 2000 - 2003 Miro Construct Pty Ltd.
* Mambo Open Source 4.5 released in December 2003. By this time, almost all of the original Miro code had disappeared during refactoring.
* 2004: mamboforge.net starts in March, 2004.
* Linux Format awards Mambo &quot;Best Free Software Project&quot; of the Year.
* Linux User and Developer names it &quot;Best Linux or Open Source Software&quot;.
* In late 2004, Mambo was targeted by legal threats concerning the intellectual property rights to certain pieces of code contained in the core. The problem was severe and cost money, man hours, and eventually the loss of some key community leaders. Miro came to the aid of Mambo, offering legal and corporate resources to protect the development team and preserve the program.
* Robert Castley resigns as Project Director and in November, Andrew Eddie takes on the role.
* December 2004: the Mambo Steering Committee was established with representatives from both Miro and the Mambo development team. This committee was designed to govern the Mambo project.
* January 2005: Andrew Eddie announces a joint venture between Mambo and Miro International Pty Ltd, with Miro proposing to offer financial support for the open source project, plus training, commercial support services, and developer certification.
At the end of January 2005 Junio Souza Martins abandons the project for personal reasons.

* February 2005: Discussions begin over the formation of a non-profit foundation for the Mambo project.
* March 2005: The name &quot;Mambo Open Source&quot; (which was commonly referred to as MOS) was changed to just &quot;Mambo&quot;, causing concern in the community over apparent confusion this would cause between the open source, community-developed CMS and Miro&#x27;s commercial offering, &quot;Mambo CMS&quot;.
* April 2005: The commercial Mambo CMS is renamed &quot;Jango&quot;.
* &quot;Best Open Source Solution&quot; and &quot;Best of Show - Total Industry Solution&quot; at LinuxWorld Boston.
* &quot;Best Open Source Solution&quot; at LinuxWorld San Francisco.
* July 2005: mambo-foundation.org domain is established.
* August 2005: Mambo Foundation, Inc is legally constituted on 8 August 2005. Miro CEO Peter Lamont appoints himself President of the Board of the new Foundation.
* 12 August: Robert Castley, who is an inaugural member of the Mambo Foundation Board of Regents, states: &quot;The Foundation allows for everything to be placed outside of Miro incl. Domain Names, hosting etc. &quot; and goes on to say that with him, the original founder of Mambo Open Source, and Andrew Eddie both being on the Board of the Mambo Foundation, Mambo would continue as a successful, open source project. He concluded his statement with,&quot;So there you have it: two very key people in the overall success of Mambo are at the helm. Trust me, Mambo is in very, very safe hands!&quot;
* A few days later, the entire team of core programmers publicly announced they had abandoned Mambo and shortly after this, Robert Castley steps down from the Board of Regents.
* The former core development team members regroup under the name &quot;Open Source Matters&quot; and the open source community at mamboserver.com fractures over allegations that the Mambo Foundation was formed without community input and with insufficient developer control. People express suspicion over the level of involvement by Miro International. By the end of August, the new project is named Joomla! and most of the former Mambo community has relocated to Open Source Matters. By the end of September, Open Source Matters Inc is a duly constituted non-profit corporation registered in New York.
* Joomla! positions itself as a &quot;rebranding of Mambo&quot; and releases its first fork of Mambo as Joomla 1.0 in September, 2005. The two code-bases are almost identical at this stage.
* Mambo forms a new core development team with Martin Brampton appointed as Core Development Team leader.
* Miro assigns all rights in the copyright of Mambo to the Mambo Foundation.
* September 2005: Neil Thompson joins the Core Development Team.
* December 2005: Miro International Pty Ltd is voluntarily deregistered as a company from 31 December 2005.
* January 2006: The rights to Miro International Pty Ltd are sold by Peter Lamont and a new business entity called Miro Software Solutions is created. Miro Software Solutions continues to develop Jango and other proprietary software under new ownership.
* March 2006: Mambo named &quot;Best Open Source Software Solution&quot; at LinuxWorld Australia.
* April 2006: Core developer team leader, Martin Brampton, resigns and leaves the project. Chad Auld takes over the role as Core Developer Team leader.
* July 2006: The Mambo Foundation websites become independent from Mambo Communities Pty Ltd.
* Following elections, the new Board of the Mambo Foundation takes office. The Mambo Foundation is now completely independent of any corporate interest.
* April 2007: Mambo 4.6.2 is released. This is a maintenance release for the 4.6.x branch and enables localisation of Mambo.
* January 2008: Mambo 4.5.6 is released. This is the final release of the Mambo 4.5 branch.
* February 2008: Chad Auld leaves the project.
* March 2008: John Messingham becomes Project Leader. Ozgur Cem Sen becomes core development team leader. Ozgur Cem Sen leaves the project shortly thereafter. Andrés Felipe Vargas Valencia is elected Team Leader.
* April 2008: Four former Mambo core developers fork Mambo and form MiaCMS.
* May 2008: Mambo 4.6.4 is released. Codename &#x27;Sunrise&#x27;, Mambo 4.6.4 is a security and maintenance release that fixes a number of serious security vulnerabilities.
* June 2008: Mambo 4.6.5 is released. Codename &#x27;Jupiter&#x27;, Mambo 4.6.5 is a security release that fixes a number of serious security vulnerabilities.
* September 2008: Core developer Neil Thompson leaves and joins the MiaCMS core development team. Mambo announces end of life for supporting PHP 4. All future releases will require PHP 5.2 or higher.
* November 2011: Andrés Felipe Vargas noted on the Mambo Foundation&#x27;s mailing list that the next minor version update was planned to be 4.6.6, followed by a major version release of 4.7.

<text>Stunt Island is a flight simulation video game for MS-DOS PCs released in 1992. It was designed by Adrian Stephens and Ronald J. Fortier and published by Walt Disney Computer Software. The game, marketed as &quot;The Stunt Flying and Filming Simulation&quot;, provides an island which contains a number of different film sets, such as a large city, various small towns, airports, oil rigs, a canyon, an aircraft carrier, and many others locations situated on a fictional island off southern California. There is a free flight mode, where the player can simply fly around in a variety of different aircraft which have unique flying characteristics and flight envelopes. Additionally, the player can position cameras and props around these sets, and create triggers to start actions including the camera panning and an object moving. The game also has an editing mode where the player can splice together taped footage and insert sound effects. The game world is small and it is impossible to leave the area of the island without returning to it. The game runs well under DosBox from ver. 0.65 to present. The game was heavily patched more than a year following its initial release. The last patch, V3 removed copyright protection and addressed many issues. GOG.com released an emulated version for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux in 2016. This GOG version, and the one offered by Steam, appear to be the unpatched ver. 1.0 release of the game.

==Game components==

===Game engine===
The game engine for &quot;Stunt Island&quot; was co-developed by The Assembly Line. It is capable of simultaneously rendering several hundred simple 3D objects on a typical early 1990s PC with 386 processor at 33 MHz with two megabytes of RAM.

The graphics of the game are rendered in 256 colors at 320x200 resolution (VGA) and the airplanes are shaded using Gouraud shading.

===Stunt coordinator===
When a player does not wish to create a stunt from scratch, he or she may go to the Stunt Coordinator on Stunt Island. The Stunt Coordinator possesses a built-in list of 32 stunt scenes. If the player is participating in the optional Stunt Pilot of the Year competition, these stunts must be completed to improve ranking.

===Set design===
In set design, a player may place props, cameras, and collideable triggers. Conditional and timed events may also be created to perform particular actions.

===Flight simulator===
While actually filming a stunt, the player&#x27;s controls are that of a flight simulator. There is an airfield in the game where the player can select a plane and fly around Stunt Island to scout different locations.

===Editing room===
In the editing room the player is able to take previously recorded footage and splice them together into a single movie. Sound effects and music may also be added.

===Theater===
Movies may be watched in this room. Such movies may come with the game, be created by the player, or be downloaded from the Internet. The game also comes with a tool called MAKEONE which may be used to generate a self-contained version of a movie, which may be played on a machine without the game by using the PLAYONE tool.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1993 praised &quot;Stunt Island&quot;″s graphics, ease of use, editing features, and variety of aircraft, concluding that &quot;it represents the future of simulation products [and] also a step toward a future where films can be created completely on the microcomputer&quot;. That year the magazine gave it a Special Award for Innovation, and nominated it for Simulation Game of the Year. The game also received a Critics Choice Award for Best Consumer Product from the Software Publishers Association, and was nominated for an award at the 1993 Game Developers Conference.

In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named &quot;Stunt Island&quot; the 45th best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, &quot;A great little package, but as with many &#x27;games&#x27; of this type, its rewards are only visible if you&#x27;re willing to invest time and effort. We strongly recommend you do just that.&quot;

<doc id="611460" wikidata="Q6664610" url="?curid=611460" title="Localization of a category">
<text>In mathematics, localization of a category consists of adding to a category inverse morphisms for some collection of morphisms, constraining them to become isomorphisms. This is formally similar to the process of localization of a ring; it in general makes objects isomorphic that were not so before. In homotopy theory, for example, there are many examples of mappings that are invertible up to homotopy; and so large classes of homotopy equivalent spaces. Calculus of fractions is another name for working in a localized category.

==Introduction and motivation==

A category &quot;C&quot; consists of objects and morphisms between these objects. The morphisms reflect relations between the objects. In many situations, it is meaningful to replace &quot;C&quot; by another category &quot;C&quot;&#x27; in which certain morphisms are forced to be isomorphisms. This process is called localization.

For example, in the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules (for some fixed commutative ring &quot;R&quot;) the multiplication by a fixed element &quot;r&quot; of &quot;R&quot; is typically (i.e., unless &quot;r&quot; is a unit) not an isomorphism: 
:formula_1
The category that is most closely related to &quot;R&quot;-modules, but where this map &quot;is&quot; an isomorphism turns out to be the category of formula_2-modules. Here formula_2 is the localization of &quot;R&quot; with respect to the (multiplicatively closed) subset &quot;S&quot; consisting of all powers of &quot;r&quot;,
formula_4
The expression &quot;most closely related&quot; is formalized by two conditions: first, there is a functor
:formula_5
sending any &quot;R&quot;-module to its localization with respect to &quot;S&quot;. Moreover, given any category &quot;C&quot; and any functor 
:formula_6
sending the multiplication map by &quot;r&quot; on any &quot;R&quot;-module (see above) to an isomorphism of &quot;C&quot;, there is a unique functor
:formula_7
such that formula_8.

==Localization of categories==
The above examples of localization of &quot;R&quot;-modules is abstracted in the following definition. In this shape, it applies in many more examples, some of which are sketched below.

Given a category &quot;C&quot; and some class &quot;W&quot; of morphisms in &quot;C&quot;, the localization &quot;C&quot;[&quot;W&quot;−1] is another category which is obtained by inverting all the morphisms in &quot;W&quot;. More formally, it is characterized by a universal property: there is a natural localization functor &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot;[&quot;W&quot;−1] and given another category &quot;D&quot;, a functor &quot;F&quot;: &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; factors uniquely over &quot;C&quot;[&quot;W&quot;−1] if and only if &quot;F&quot; sends all arrows in &quot;W&quot; to isomorphisms.

Thus, the localization of the category is unique up to unique isomorphism of categories, provided that it exists. One construction of the localization is done by declaring that its objects are the same as those in &quot;C&quot;, but the morphisms are enhanced by adding a formal inverse for each morphism in &quot;W&quot;. Under suitable hypotheses on &quot;W&quot;, the morphisms from object &quot;X&quot; to object &quot;Y&quot; are given by &quot;roofs&quot;
:formula_9
(where &quot;X&quot;&#x27; is an arbitrary object of &quot;C&quot; and &quot;f&quot; is in the given class &quot;W&quot; of morphisms), modulo certain equivalence relations. These relations turn the map going in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction into an inverse of &quot;f&quot;. This &quot;calculus of fractions&quot; can be seen as a generalization of the construction of rational numbers as equivalence classes of pairs of integers.

This procedure, however, in general yields a proper class of morphisms between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. Typically, the morphisms in a category are only allowed to form a set. Some authors simply ignore such set-theoretic issues.

===Model categories===
A rigorous construction of localization of categories, avoiding these set-theoretic issues, was one of the initial reasons for the development of the theory of model categories: a model category &quot;M&quot; is a category in which there are three classes of maps; one of these classes is the class of weak equivalences. The homotopy category Ho(&quot;M&quot;) is then the localization with respect to the weak equivalences. The axioms of a model category ensure that this localization can be defined without set-theoretical difficulties.

===Alternative definition===

Some authors also define a &quot;localization&quot; of a category &quot;C&quot; to be an idempotent and coaugmented functor. A coaugmented functor is a pair &quot;(L,l)&quot; where &quot;L:C → C&quot; is an endofunctor and &quot;l:Id → L&quot; is a natural transformation from the identity functor to &quot;L&quot; (called the coaugmentation). A coaugmented functor is idempotent if, for every &quot;X&quot;, both maps &quot;L(lX),lL(X):L(X) → LL(X)&quot; are isomorphisms. It can be proven that in this case, both maps are equal.

This definition is related to the one given above as follows: applying the first definition, there is, in many situations, not only a canonical functor formula_10, but also a functor in the opposite direction,
:formula_11
For example, modules over the localization formula_2 of a ring are also modules over &quot;R&quot; itself, giving a functor
:formula_13
In this case, the composition
:formula_14
is a localization of &quot;C&quot; in the sense of an idempotent and coaugmented functor.

==Examples==

===Serre&#x27;s &quot;C&quot;-theory===

Serre introduced the idea of working in homotopy theory &quot;modulo&quot; some class &quot;C&quot; of abelian groups. This meant that groups &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; were treated as isomorphic, if for example &quot;A/B&quot; lay in &quot;C&quot;. 

===Module theory===

In the theory of modules over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, when &quot;R&quot; has Krull dimension ≥ 2, it can be useful to treat modules &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; as &quot;pseudo-isomorphic&quot; if &quot;M/N&quot; has support of codimension at least two. This idea is much used in Iwasawa theory.

===Derived categories===

The derived category of an abelian category is much used in homological algebra. It is the localization of the category of chain complexes (up to homotopy) with respect to the quasi-isomorphisms.

=== Quotients of abelian categories ===
Given an abelian category &quot;A&quot; and a Serre subcategory &quot;B,&quot; one can define the quotient category &quot;A/B,&quot; which is an abelian category equipped with an exact functor from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;A/B&quot; that is essentially surjective and has kernel &quot;B.&quot; This quotient category can be constructed as a localization of &quot;A&quot; by the class of morphisms whose kernel and cokernel are both in &quot;B.&quot;

===Abelian varieties up to isogeny===

An isogeny from an abelian variety &quot;A&quot; to another one &quot;B&quot; is a surjective morphism with finite kernel. Some theorems on abelian varieties require the idea of &quot;abelian variety up to isogeny&quot; for their convenient statement. For example, given an abelian subvariety &quot;A1&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, there is another subvariety &quot;A2&quot; of &quot;A&quot; such that

:&quot;A1&quot; × &quot;A2&quot;

is &quot;isogenous&quot; to &quot;A&quot; (Poincaré&#x27;s reducibility theorem: see for example &quot;Abelian Varieties&quot; by David Mumford). To call this a direct sum decomposition, we should work in the category of abelian varieties up to isogeny.

== Related concepts ==

The localization of a topological space, introduced by Dennis Sullivan, produces another topological space whose homology is a localization of the homology of the original space.

A much more general concept from homotopical algebra, including as special cases both the localization of spaces and of categories, is the &quot;Bousfield localization&quot; of a model category. Bousfield localization forces certain maps to become weak equivalences, which is in general weaker than forcing them to become isomorphisms.

<text>Gundappa Ranganath Viswanath (born 12 February 1949) is a former Indian cricketer. Vishwanath was rated as one of India&#x27;s finest batsmen throughout the 1970s. Viswanath played Test cricket for India from 1969 to 1983, making 91 appearances and scoring more than 6,000 runs. He also played in One Day Internationals from 1974 to 1982, including the World Cups of 1975 and 1979.

At state level, he played for Karnataka (formerly Mysore) throughout his career. Viswanath, popularly nicknamed &quot;Vishy&quot;, had an elegant and wristy batting style which emphasized timing rather than power. Though he had a complete repertoire of shots around the wicket, Viswanath&#x27;s choice shot was the square cut, one he often used to great effect against fast bowlers. He regularly fielded at slip.

He is the only cricketer to score a double century on debut in a first-class match (against Andhra Pradesh in 1967) and a century on debut in a Test match. In 2008, he received the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award, the highest honour Indian board can bestow on a former player.

==Career and highlights==
On his Test match debut, Viswanath scored a century against Australia at Kanpur in 1969 in a drawn match. He also recorded a duck in the same game, one of only four batsmen to have done this in their first match. Viswanath is the first and only player to score a double century on first-class debut as well as a century on Test debut. His best performances tended to come on challenging pitches, and while some of his best innings did not result in centuries, they were still important to the team&#x27;s success.

Against Australia and the West Indies, both known for their strong pace attacks, he had a batting average of over 50. He was at his peak in the mid-1970s. Against the West Indies at Madras in 1974–75 he scored 97 not out out of a total of 190 against a bowling attack containing Andy Roberts. Despite not being a century, it was regarded as one of the finest performances by an Indian and it led to an Indian victory. The Wisden 100 ranked it the 38th best innings of all time, and the second best non-century. He scored a match-winning century in the previous Test at Calcutta, but despite a 95 in the final Test at Bombay the series was lost 3–2.

In 1975–76, Viswanath again produced some strong performances against the West Indies, the most notable of which was his 112 at Port of Spain which helped India to reach the victory target of 403. At the time, this was the highest successful run-chase in Test cricket. In 1978–79 at Madras he again top scored with 124 out of a total of 255. India went on to win the match which ultimately led to a 1–0 series victory in the 6-match series, although this West Indian side was considerably weaker than in previous series after many players opted to play in World Series Cricket instead.

==Captaincy==

Viswanath also had a brief stint as the Indian captain in 1979–80. In the two Tests he captained, one was drawn and one was lost, the latter being the Golden Jubilee Test against England. In this match he recalled Bob Taylor to the crease after the umpire had already given him out. Taylor went on to score some vital runs for England helping them to win the match.

==Personal life==
In March 1978, Gundappa Viswanath married Kavita, the sister of teammate Sunil Gavaskar. They have a son named Daivik and live in Bangalore.

==Post retirement==
Viswanath retired from Tests in 1983, and later served as a match referee for the ICC from 1999 to 2004. He was also the chairman of the national selection committee, and also served as the manager of the Indian cricket team. He is also involved in cricket coaching at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) and has served as vice-president of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).

==Bibliography==
On 12 March 2022, his autobiography titled &#x27;Wrist Assured&#x27; was launched during the opening day of the second Test between India and Sri Lanka in Bangalore. The book was unveiled by his former teammates Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar in a brief ceremony held during the dinner break of the day/night game.

==Recognition==
Viswanath was awarded Col. C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009 by BCCI which is one of the highest awards given in Indian cricket. He also received the Arjuna award in the year 197778.

<doc id="611468" wikidata="Q7228813" url="?curid=611468" title="Poor Poor Pitiful Me">
<text>&quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me&quot; is a rock song written and first recorded by American musician Warren Zevon in 1976.

With gender references reversed, it was made a hit twice: first as a top-40 hit for Linda Ronstadt, then almost 2 decades later by Terri Clark, whose version topped the Canadian country charts and reached the country top five in the U.S.

==Warren Zevon version==

===Background===
In keeping with Warren Zevon&#x27;s sardonic lyrical style, the song&#x27;s verses deal with a suicide attempt, domestic abuse, and a brush with sadomasochism. It is reputed to be a friendly swipe at Jackson Browne; Browne&#x27;s own songwriting (such as &quot;Here Come Those Tears Again&quot; and &quot;Sleep&#x27;s Dark and Silent Gate&quot; from &quot;The Pretender&quot;) could be quite depressing.

The song &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me&quot; was produced by Browne and was featured on Zevon&#x27;s eponymous 1976 album &quot;Warren Zevon&quot; with backing vocals by Lindsey Buckingham. The track was later included on his greatest hits compilations &quot;A Quiet Normal Life&quot; (1986), &quot;I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead&quot; (1996), and &quot;&quot; (2002). Live versions appeared on 1980s &quot;Stand in the Fire&quot; and 1993&#x27;s &quot;Learning to Flinch&quot;. Alternate studio versions were included in the 2008 reissue of &quot;Warren Zevon&quot;, as well as the posthumous 2007 compilation &quot;&quot;.

==Linda Ronstadt version==
===Background===
Linda Ronstadt recorded a gender-altered version of the song in 1977. Ronstadt would recall Jackson Browne had pitched &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me&quot; to her, teaching it to her in the living room of her Malibu home. &quot;The verse in “Poor Pitiful Me” was “I met a girl on the Sunset Strip,” I think, “She asked me if I’d beat her / She took me up to her hotel room / And wrecked my mojo heater.” It was really funny, and I&#x27;m saying to Jackson, “I can’t sing those words, man! That’s not who I am. . . . I have to leave that part out.” 

With Zevon&#x27;s blessing, Ronstadt replaced the verse with “Well I met a boy in the Vieux Carré / Down in Yokohama / He picked me up and he threw me down / Saying &quot;Please don&#x27;t hurt me Mama!&quot;.” This verse was also used in Clark&#x27;s version of the song.

Ronstadt&#x27;s interpretation was produced by Peter Asher for her multi-platinum album &quot;Simple Dreams.&quot; Ronstadt&#x27;s live version appeared on the soundtrack album to the 1978 movie &quot;FM&quot;, while the studio version was included on her platinum-plus album &quot;Greatest Hits, Volume 2&quot;.

===Reception===
Released as a single on the Asylum label at the beginning of 1978, Ronstadt&#x27;s version was the week&#x27;s highest debut on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart the week of January 28, 1978. It reached number 26 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 and number 31 in &quot;Billboard&quot;.

===Chart performance===
==Terri Clark version==
===Background===
Another hit cover version of the song was recorded by Canadian country singer Terri Clark. It was released in September 1996 as the lead single from her second album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Just the Same&quot;. Clark told &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; that she heard Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s version of the song in a local gymnasium while she was exercising. She said &quot;and I thought, what a cool song. What a great country record that could make. I started doing it live, and it worked.&quot;

===Reception===
&quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me&quot; debuted at number 47 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks for the week of October 12, 1996. Clark&#x27;s version was a number one hit on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; country charts, and a number five hit on the country charts in the U.S.

===Music video===
The music video was directed by Deaton Flanigen and premiered in late 1996. It comprises black-and-white tour footage interspersed with Clark being approached by a series of men while her car is being fixed at a full service gas station. Eventually, she realizes the man fixing her car is the one for her. She starts to drive off, before calling him over to get in. The two drive off together, leaving the other two co-workers at the shop surprised.

===Chart performance===
===Year-end charts===
==Other versions==
*In 1986, SNFU did a hardcore punk cover of the song on the compilation &quot;It Came from the Pit&quot;. Lead singer Mr. Chi Pig sang the Linda Ronstadt lyrics with a few changes, but kept it as being about men he had encountered.
*Vitamin String Quartet recorded an instrumental version of the song on &quot;Dad Get Me Out of This: The String Quartet Tribute to Warren Zevon&quot; in 2003.
*In 2004 Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt covered it on &quot;Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon&quot;.

<text>Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings, (9 December 175428 November 1826), styled The Honourable Francis Rawdon from birth until 1762, Lord Rawdon between 1762 and 1783, The Lord Rawdon from 1783 to 1793 and The Earl of Moira between 1793 and 1816, was an Anglo-Irish politician and military officer who served as Governor-General of India from 1813 to 1823. He had also served with British forces for years during the American Revolutionary War and in 1794 during the War of the First Coalition. In Ireland, he was critical of the policy of coercion used to break the United Irish movement for representative government and national independence. He took the additional surname &quot;Hastings&quot; in 1790 in compliance with the will of his maternal uncle, Francis Hastings, 10th Earl of Huntingdon.

==Background, education and early military career==
Hastings was born at Moira, County Down, the son of John Rawdon, 1st Earl of Moira and Elizabeth Hastings, 13th Baroness Hastings, who was a daughter of the 9th Earl of Huntingdon. He was baptised at St. Audoen&#x27;s Church, Dublin, on 2 January 1755. He grew up in Moira and in Dublin. He joined the British Army on 7 August 1771 as an ensign in the 15th Foot (the going rate for purchasing a commission for this rank was £200). From that time on his life was spent entirely in the service of his country. He was at Harrow School and matriculated at University College, Oxford, but dropped out. He became friends there with Banastre Tarleton. With his uncle Lord Huntingdon, he went on the Grand Tour. On 20 October 1773, he was promoted to lieutenant in the 5th Foot. He returned to England to join his regiment, and sailed for America on 7 May 1774.

==American War of Independence==
===Battle of Bunker Hill===

Rawdon was posted at Boston as a lieutenant in the 5th Regiment of Foot&#x27;s Grenadier company, which was then under the command of Captain Francis Marsden. He first saw action at the Battles of Lexington and Concord and the Battle of Bunker Hill. Serving with the grenadiers, he participated in the second assault against Breed&#x27;s Hill (which failed), and the third assault against the redoubt. His superior, Captain Harris, was wounded beside him. At the age of 21, Lord Rawdon took command of the company for the third and final assault. When the troops of the third assault began to falter, Rawdon stood atop of the American redoubt, waving the British ensign. John Burgoyne noted in dispatches: &quot;Lord Rawdon has this day stamped his fame for life.&quot; He also was wounded during the assault. He was promoted captain, and given a company in the 63rd Foot.

Lord Rawdon is depicted in John Trumbull&#x27;s famous painting, &quot;The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill&quot;. Rawdon is in the far background holding the British ensign.

===Campaigns in the Carolinas and New York, 1775–76===

He was appointed Aide-de-camp to General Sir Henry Clinton, and sailed with him on the expedition to Brunswick Town, North Carolina, on the Cape Fear River, and then to the repulse at Fort Moultrie, Charleston, South Carolina. He returned with him to New York. On 4 August, he dined with General Clinton, Admiral Lord Howe, Lord Cornwallis, General Vaughan, and others. During the Battle of Long Island, he was at headquarters with Clinton.

On 15 September, Rawdon led his men at Kip&#x27;s Bay, an amphibious landing on Manhattan island. He participated at the landings at Pell&#x27;s Point.

===Rhode Island, England, and New York===
On 8 December Rawdon landed with Clinton at Rhode Island, securing the ports for the British Navy. On 13 January 1777, with Clinton, he departed for London, arriving on 1 March. During a ball at Lord George Germain&#x27;s, he met Lafayette, who was visiting London.

Returning to America in July, while Howe went to his Philadelphia campaign, Rawdon went with Clinton to the New York headquarters. He participated in the battles of the New York Highlands, where on 7 October, Fort Constitution (opposite West Point) was captured. However, this was too late to link up with General Burgoyne at Albany.

Rawdon was sent to Philadelphia with dispatches and returned to New York for the winter, where he raised a regiment, called the Volunteers of Ireland, recruited from deserters and Irish Loyalists. Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the future United Irish leader and rebel, served as his aide-de-camp. Promoted colonel in command of this regiment, Rawdon went with Clinton to Philadelphia. starting out on 18 June 1778, he went with Clinton during the withdrawal from Philadelphia to New York, and saw action at the Battle of Monmouth. He was appointed adjutant general. Rawdon was sent to learn news of the Battle of Rhode Island.

In New York, on 3 September 1779, he quarrelled with Clinton, and resigned his position as adjutant general. He served with the Volunteers of Ireland during the raid on Staten Island by Lord Stirling on 15 January 1780.

===Southern Campaign===

He went south to the Siege of Charleston with reinforcements. After the city fell to the British, Lord Cornwallis posted him at Camden (16 August 1780) as the British sought to occupy South Carolina. Rawdon commanded the British left wing at the Battle of Camden. When Cornwallis went into Virginia, he left Rawdon in effective command in the South.

Perhaps his most noted achievement was the victory in 1781 at the Battle of Hobkirk&#x27;s Hill, in which, in command of only a small force, he defeated by superior military skill and determination, a much larger body of Americans. Thinking (in error) that General Nathanael Greene had moved his artillery away, Rawdon attacked Greene&#x27;s left wing. Rawdon quickly concentrated his entire force on the American left flank, using the military advantage of local superiority, which forced the American line to collapse and abandon the field in disorder.

However, Rawdon was forced to begin a gradual retreat to Charleston. He relieved the Siege of Ninety-Six, evacuating its small garrison and conducting a limited pursuit of American troops. He withdrew his forces to Charleston. In July 1781, in poor health, he gave up his command. On his return to Great Britain, he was captured at sea by François Joseph Paul de Grasse, but was exchanged. After Rawdon&#x27;s departure, the British evacuated Charleston as the war drew to a close. They took thousands of Loyalists and freed slaves with them, having promised freedom to slaves of rebels who joined their lines, resettling these groups in Nova Scotia and the Caribbean.

==Irish parliamentary patriot==
Rawdon sat for Randalstown, County Antrim, in the Irish House of Commons from 1781 until 1783. In the Irish Parliament, Rawdon associated on most questions with the Patriot party of Henry Grattan and Lord Charlemont. He succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Moira on 20 June 1793, and thereafter served first in the Irish House of Lords

In an eve-of-the -Rebellion speech to the Lords on 19 February 1798, he appealed for parliamentary reform: for the abolition of the &quot;pocket boroughs&quot; through which the Lords and the Dublin Castle administration effectively nominated two-thirds of the Irish Commons, and for an amendment to the Oath of Supremacy to allow Catholics (extended the right to vote in 1793 on the same limited and idiosyncratic terms as Protestants) to sit in parliament. In January 1793, he had received the delegates of the Catholic Committee, including as their agent Theobald Wolfe Tone, in London and helped arrange their audience with the king. When rumours followed that Rawdon might replace the Earl of Westmorland as Irish Viceroy, Tone, a United Irishman, approached him in hopes of being appointed his private secretary. In June, Rawdon became godfather to Tone&#x27;s fourth child, named in his honour Francis Rawdon Tone.

While alarmed by the drift of the United Irishmen, despairing of reform, toward insurrection, Rawdon denounced the government&#x27;s policy of coercion. To the king he sought to present evidence collated and supplied by the eminent physician Whitley Stokes and the lawyer William Sampson of the atrocities and tortures visited upon country people by Crown forces as they sought to break-up and disarm the movement.

In 1796, Tone was asked by his French hosts whether &quot;we might choose a king&quot; for Ireland (the people of the country being &quot;in general very ignorant&quot;). Tone responded that &quot;Lord Moira&quot; was the only person that might conceivably fill such a role, but that he had &quot;blown his reputation to pieces by accepting a command against France&quot;. (Tone&#x27;s larger objection was that the Presbyterians, who he was in no doubt would &quot;direct the public sentiment in framing a government&quot;, were &quot;thoroughly enlightened and sincere republicans&quot;).&quot;&quot;

After the United Irish risings in the summer of 1798, Rawdon opposed the government&#x27;s plans to abolish the Irish Parliament and effect a legislative union with Great Britain. While Governor General of India, in 1814 Rawdon was to offer further evidence of an Irish attachment. He headed the list of subscribers in Bengal to the Irish Harp Society formed in Belfast &quot;to revive the Ancient Music of Ireland&quot; by veterans of the patriotic and reform politics of the 1780s and &#x27;90s, among them several former United Irishmen.

Prior to leaving for India, in 1812 Rawdon had also used his offices to secure a position—registrar of the Admiralty Prize Court in Bermuda—for Thomas Moore, the Irish patriotic bard and admirer of the leading United Irishmen. Moore hailed as &quot;the &quot;ultimi Romanorum&quot; of our country&quot; both Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Tone whom Rawson himself described as &quot;The Irish Lafayette&quot;.

== British Peer and prime-ministerial candidate ==

=== Lord Hastings ===
After his return from America, Rawdon had been honoured by the king. In March 1783, he was created Baron Rawdon, of Rawdon, in the County of York. In 1787, he became friends with the Prince of Wales, and loaned him many thousands of pounds. In 1788 he became embroiled in the Regency Crisis.

In 1789 his mother succeeded to the barony of Hastings, and Rawdon, an in accordance to his uncle&#x27;s will, added the surname of Hastings to his own. From 1801, as Lord Hastings he sat in the United Kingdom House of Lords.

Inheriting Donington Hall in Leicestershire from his uncle, Rawdon rebuilt it in 1790–93 in the Gothic style; the architect was William Wilkins the Elder. It is now a Grade II* listed building. He placed the estate at the disposal of the Bourbon Princes upon their exile in England following the French Revolution. He is said to have left a signed chequebook in each bedroom for the occupant to use at pleasure.

Rawdon became active in associations in London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1787 and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1793. For 1806–08 he was Grand Master of the Free Masons. In May 1789 he acted as the Duke of York&#x27;s second in his duel with Lieut.-Colonel Lennox on Wimbledon Common.

Following the declaration of war in 1793 of France upon Great Britain, Rawdon was appointed major general, on 12 October 1793. Sent by the Pitt ministry, Rawdon launched an expedition into Ostend, France, in 1794. He marched to join with the army of the Duke of York, at Alost. The French general Pichegru, with superior numbers, forced the British back toward their base at Antwerp. Rawdon left the expedition, feeling Pitt had broken promises.

=== Candidature for Prime Minister ===
In 1797 it was rumoured briefly that Rawdon would replace Pitt as Prime Minister. There was some discontent with Pitt over his policies regarding the war with France. Additionally, Pitt&#x27;s long tenure in office had given him ample opportunity to annoy various political grandees, including but not limited to The Duke of Leeds and Lords Thurlow and Lansdowne.

In mid-May, a combination of these various figures, coupled with a handful of Members of Parliament, proposed to make Rawdon the Prime Minister. Having fought in the American War and having led an expedition to Quiberon, he commanded widespread respect. His relationship with the Prince of Wales also established him as a potential rival to Pitt, who was supported strongly by George III.

The prime motivation for the plan of having Rawdon become Prime Minister was to secure peace with France, the plotters had come to believe (somewhat unfairly) that Pitt was an obstacle to this objective. But their plan collapsed barely a month later in mid-June because of a lack of support from the political establishment. Additionally, when Rawdon wrote to the King to propose the change of chief ministers, the monarch ignored him. Thus the proposal came to nothing.

He became Commander-in-Chief, Scotland with the rank of full general in September 1803. In this capacity he rented the huge Duddingston House, south of Edinburgh.

Becoming a Whig in politics, Rawdon entered government in 1806 as part of the Ministry of All the Talents as Master-General of the Ordnance, which enabled him to carry a philanthropic measure, which he had promoted since his first entry into the House of Lords, the Debtor and Creditor Bill for relief of poor debtors. However, he resigned his post on the fall of the ministry the next year. He was also Constable of the Tower (of London) from 1806 to his death.

During a debate in the House of Lords on 5 February 1807 over the proposed Slave Trade Act 1807, which would abolish British involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, he publicly supported the bill and stated that &quot;the evidence upon the table of the house must be sufficient to convince their lordships of the necessity of abolishing this sanguinary traffic. If noble lords were not satisfied with this evidence, he referred them to Holy Writ, he referred them to that great work of our forefathers the Old Testament, and that great Commentator upon that work, whose maxim was, &quot;Do unto others as you would they should do unto you.&quot;

Being a close associate of the Prince-Regent, Moira was asked by him to form a Whig government after the assassination of Spencer Perceval in 1812 ended that ministry. Moira&#x27;s attempts to create a governing coalition failed, but as a mark of the prince&#x27;s respect, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter in that year. The Tories returned to power under the Earl of Liverpool. On 6 December 1816, after the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War (see below), Moira was raised to the rank of Marquess of Hastings together with the subsidiary titles Viscount Loudoun and Earl of Rawdon.

==Governor-General of India==
=== Appointment ===

Through the influence of the Prince-Regent, Moira was appointed Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William, effectively the Governor-General of India, on 11 November 1812. His tenure as Governor-General was a memorable one, overseeing the victory in the Gurkha War (1814–1816); the final conquest of the Marathas in 1818; and the purchase of the island of Singapore in 1819.

=== Military policy ===
After delays clearing his affairs, he reached Madras on 11 September 1813. In October, he settled in at Calcutta and assumed office. British India then consisted of Madras, Bengal, and Bombay. He commanded an army of 15,000 British regulars, a Bengal army of 27 regiments of native infantry, and eight regiments of cavalry; a Madras army, led by General John Abercrombie of 24 regiments of native infantry, and eight regiments of native cavalry.

Hastings employed Sita Ram, a Bengal draftsman to record his 1814-15 (seventeen month) inspection of British possessions. Resulting in over 230 watercolours of locations in India.

====Anglo-Nepalese War====

In May 1813, the British declared war against the Gurkhas of Nepal. Hastings sent four divisions in separate attacks led by General Bennet Marley with 8,000 men against Kathmandu, General John Sullivan Wood with 4,000 men against Butwal, General Sir David Ochterlony with 10,000 men against Amar Singh Thapa, and General Robert Rollo Gillespie, with 3,500 men against Nahan, Srinagar, and Garhwal. Only Ochterlony had some success; Gillespie was killed. After inconclusive negotiations, Hastings reinforced Ochterlony to 20,000 men, who then won the battle of Makwanpur on 28 February. The Gurkhas then sued for peace, under the Sugauli Treaty.

====Third Anglo-Maratha War====

After raids by Pindaris in January 1817, Hastings led a force at Hindustan in the North; in the South, the Army of the Deccan, under the command of General Sir Thomas Hislop. The Peshwa was defeated by William Fullarton Elphinstone on the Poona. Appa Sahib was defeated at the battle of Nagpur. Hislop defeated Holkar at the Battle of Mahidpur. These events effectively established the supremacy of British power in India.

===Diplomacy===
Rawdon was active diplomatically, protecting weaker Indian states. His domestic policy in India was also largely successful, seeing the repair of the Mughul canal system in Delhi in 1820, as well as educational and administrative reforms, and encouraging press freedom. He confirmed the purchase of Singapore from the Sultan of Jahore, by Sir Stamford Raffles, in January 1819.

His last years of office were embittered by a then-notorious matter, the affairs of the W. Palmer and Company banking house. The whole affair was mixed up with insinuations against Lord Hastings, especially charging him with having shown favouritism towards one of the partners in the firm. He was later exonerated but the experience embittered him.
He also became increasingly estranged from the East India Company&#x27;s Board of Control (see Company rule in India). He resigned in 1821 but did not leave India until early 1823.

== Death ==
Rawdon was appointed Governor of Malta in 1824 but died at sea off Naples two years later aboard HMS &quot;Revenge&quot;, while attempting to return home with his wife. She returned his body to Malta, and following his earlier directions, cut off his right hand and preserved it, to be buried with her when she died. His body was then laid to rest in a large marble sarcophagus in Hastings Gardens, Valletta. His hand was eventually interred, clasped with hers, in the family vault at Loudoun Kirk.

==Legacy==

<doc id="611472" wikidata="Q3127308" url="?curid=611472" title="Harbor Island, Seattle">
<text>Harbor Island is an artificial island in the mouth of the Duwamish River in Seattle, Washington, United States, where it empties into Elliott Bay. Built by the Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company, it was completed in 1909 and was then the largest artificial island in the world, at 350 acres (1.4 km2). Since 1912, the island has been used for commercial and industrial activities including secondary lead smelting, shipbuilding and repair, bulk petroleum storage, metal fabrication and containerized cargo shipping. Warehouses, laboratories and other buildings are located on the island.

Harbor Island was made from 24 million yd3 (18 million m3) of earth removed in the Jackson and Dearborn Street regrades and dredged from the bed of the Duwamish River.

Harbor Island lost its title as the world&#x27;s largest artificial island in 1938 with the completion of Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, at 395 acres (1.60 km2). It regained the title in 1967, at which time its area had increased to nearly 397 acres (1.61 km2), but has now been far surpassed in area; since 2004, Rokkō Island in Kobe harbor in Japan is over 3.5 times larger. The official land area, as reported by the United States Census Bureau, was , at the 2000 census. There was also a permanent population of three persons reported on the island at that time.

The West Seattle Bridge passes over the island, as does the newer Spokane Street Bridge, a swing bridge across the West Waterway. The East Waterway is crossed by a causeway supported a few feet above high tide by pilings.

Vigor Industrial operates a 27-acre (10.9 ha) shipyard on the island, which is also the site of some of the Port of Seattle&#x27;s terminals and the publishing branch of The Mountaineers (&quot;&quot;, among others).

The Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation built 45 destroyers for the United States Navy on the island from 1941 to 1946, in a yard now owned by Vigor.

<doc id="611473" wikidata="Q2749265" url="?curid=611473" title="Eric Hollies">
<text>William Eric Hollies (5 June 1912 – 16 April 1981) was an English cricketer, who is mainly remembered for dismissing Donald Bradman for a duck in Bradman&#x27;s final Test match innings, in which he needed only four runs for a Test average of 100. Hollies played all his first-class cricket career for Warwickshire, taking 2,323 wickets at less than 21 apiece.

Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted: &quot;Hollies was one of cricket&#x27;s most extraordinary characters, whose meagre thirteen Tests in no way reflected his contribution to the game. He was a fastish leg-break bowler who rarely had much use for the googly.&quot; Bateman added: &quot;loquacious, with a rich seam of Black Country humour, he was an immensely respected and hard-working cricketer&quot;.

==Life and career==
Hollies was born in Old Hill, Staffordshire. A leg spin bowler, Hollies made his English county debut for Warwickshire in 1932 and debuted for England in 1935, after showing his skill on the generally easy Edgbaston wickets. Hollies did not spin the ball as much as most leg-spinners but he gained in accuracy as a result, and he frequently bowled amazingly long spells for his county, most notably 73 overs in one innings against Worcestershire in 1949. He varied his stock leg-break with a top-spinner and a googly that was well concealed and gained him many wickets, most famously the one of Bradman in 1948.

He took over 100 wickets for Warwickshire every year between 1935 and 1957, with the exceptions of 1936 (dreadful weather that reduced his normally prodigious output of overs), 1953 (injury) and 1956 (poor form, probably due to him captaining the side). During the war, when three-day cricket was impossible due to the labour demands of war production and military service, Hollies bowled for West Bromwich Dartmouth in the Birmingham and District League and his skill was such as to make them invincible. With Hollies taking a total of 499 wickets as their professional, West Bromwich Dartmouth won the league every year from 1941 to 1945 and lost only seven matches during the war period.

At his peak, he was one of the best bowlers in England, and it is believed that the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) erred in not taking him to Australia, after he was the leading wicket-taker in the country for a struggling Warwickshire side in 1946. That year, on one of the relatively few hard pitches, he took, without the direct assistance of a fielder, all ten wickets (seven bowled, three LBW) in an innings against Nottinghamshire.

After a poor season in 1947, Hollies returned to form in 1948, and was the one bowler who looked threatening against the Australian batsmen. He famously bowled out Bradman second ball for a duck, when the latter needed just four runs to ensure a Test match average of at least 100. In addition to his performance in the Oval Test, he took eight for 107 against a strong batting side for his county. In 1949, he played in all four Tests against New Zealand but the pitches blunted his effectiveness (though he was always steady), and from 1951, when English bowling recovered some of its pre-Second World War strength, he was never in the running for Test honours, despite playing a major role in Warwickshire&#x27;s County Championship success in 1951.

He continued to bowl well right up to his last match, and was finally named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1955, after taking 100 wickets for the tenth time. By the time of his retirement from first-class cricket in 1957, he had taken more wickets for Warwickshire than any other player.

After Hollies retired from county cricket, he played for Staffordshire a few times in 1958, and continued to bowl in league cricket until the 1970s.

Hollies was, however, remarkable for his incompetence as a batsman. His total of 1,673 runs was 650 fewer than his haul of wickets, and only once (in 1954) did he reach 30 in an innings. In fact, he did not reach 20 in any innings between 1946 and 1953, and equalled an all-time first-class record, between July 1948 and August 1950, of seventy-one consecutive innings without reaching double figures. The nearest approach was by Nobby Clark of Northamptonshire with sixty-five innings without reaching double figures between 1925 and 1927.

&quot;The last time I saw Eric Hollies bat at Birmingham,” recalled Jack Fingleton in 1958, &quot;he was clapped and cheered all the way to the middle at No. 11. Everybody knew there would be no pretty passes at the ball and deft deflections from Eric. They knew that if he could only survive two balls they would see something in batting unknown to any textbook&quot;. Bateman added: &quot;when it was time to get his pads on, Eric would prop his bat up in the Edgbaston dressing room window and say to it: &#x27;Now while I’m getting ready, you find out what the ball’s doing&#x27;”.

Warwickshire CCC named one of the stands at Edgbaston Cricket Ground for Eric Hollies Stand, and it has become famous for seating the liveliest and most raucous supporters.

Hollies died in Chinley, Derbyshire in April 1981, at the age of 68.

<doc id="611475" wikidata="Q210287" url="?curid=611475" title="Qufu">
<text>Qufu ( ; ) is a county-level city in southwestern Shandong province, East China. It is located about south of the provincial capital Jinan and northeast of the prefectural seat at Jining. Qufu has an area of 815 square kilometers, and a total population of 653,000 inhabitants, of which, 188,000 live in urban areas.

Qufu is best known as the hometown of Confucius, who is traditionally believed to have been born at nearby Mount Ni. The city contains numerous historic palaces, temples and cemeteries. The three most famous cultural sites of the city, collectively known as &quot;San Kong&quot; (, are the Temple of Confucius (), the Cemetery of Confucius (), and the Kong Family Mansion (). Together, these three sites have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1994. In July 2015, Qufu became the third International Cittaslow in China.

==Etymology==
The name Qufu literally means &quot;crooked hill&quot;, and refers to a mile-long hill that was part of the city during its time as capital of the state of Lu.

== Administrative divisions ==
The city of Qufu is divided into 4 subdistricts, and 8 towns. The city government is located within .
==History==
During the Shang, the area around Qufu was home to the people of Yan, who were counted by the Chinese among the &quot;Eastern Barbarians&quot; or &quot;Dongyi&quot;. Along with Pugu (around Binzhou) and Xu (along the Huai River), Yan joined the Shang prince Wu Geng and the Three Guards in their failed rebellion against the Duke of Zhou BC. After the rebels&#x27; defeat, the Duke launched punitive campaigns against the Dongyi, forcing their submission and placing their territory under loyal nobles. The territory of the Yan became part of the state of Lu, who made Qufu their capital throughout the Spring and Autumn period. This city had walls considerably larger than the present Ming-era fortifications, including more land to the east and north.

During the Tang dynasty and the early days of the Song dynasty, the city was centered around the present-day Temple of Duke Zhou, at the northeastern corner of today&#x27;s walled city. At 1012, Qufu was renamed to Xianyuan County (), and relocated to the new site, some east of today&#x27;s walled city, next to the supposed birthplace of the legendary Yellow Emperor and the tomb of his son Shaohao. A temple in honor of the Yellow Emperor was built there; all that remains today are two giant stelae (the Shou Qiu site).

After the conquest of the northern China by the Jurchens, the new Jin dynasty renamed Xianyuan back to Qufu (in 1142), but the city stayed at its Song location. It was not until the reign of the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty (1522) that the present-day city wall was built. The site of the city in 1012–1522 is now Jiuxian Village ().

During the Southern Song dynasty the descendant of Confucius at Qufu, the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the future Song Emperor Gaozong to Quzhou in Zhejiang, while the newly established Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou&#x27;s brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng. From that time up until the Yuan dynasty, there were two Duke Yanshengs, one in the north in Qufu and the other in the south at Quzhou. An invitation to come back to Qufu was extended to the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu by the Yuan dynasty emperor Kublai Khan. The title was taken away from the southern branch after Kong Zhu rejected the invitation, so the northern branch of the family kept the title of Duke Yansheng. The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day. Confucius&#x27;s descendants in Quzhou alone number 30,000. The Hanlin Academy rank of Wujing boshi was awarded to the southern branch at Quzhou by a Ming emperor while the northern branch at Qufu held the title Duke Yansheng. Kong Ruogu (), also known as Kong Chuan () 47th generation was claimed to be the ancestor of the Southern branch after Kong Zhu died by Northern branch member Kong Guanghuang.

In 1948, Qufu played a minor role in the Yanzhou Campaign of the Chinese Civil War.

The artifacts of the historical sites at Qufu suffered extensive damage during the Cultural Revolution when about 200 staff members and students of Beijing Normal University led by Tan Houlan (, 1937–1982), one of the five most powerful student leaders of the Cultural Revolution, came to Qufu and destroyed more than 6000 artifacts as part of destroying Four Olds in November 1966.

Before the wide adoption of Pinyin, the name of the city (often viewed as a county seat, i.e. &quot;Qufu xian&quot;) was transcribed in English in a variety of ways, such as Ch&#x27;ü-fou-hien, Kio-feu-hien, Kio-fou-hien,
Kiu-fu,
Kiuh Fow, Keuhfow, Kufow, and Chufou.

==Geography==
The small historical center of Qufu is surrounded by the restored Ming-era city wall and rivers/moats. The Drum Tower (&quot;Gulou&quot;) is in the center of the walled city; the Temple of Confucius (&quot;Kong Miao&quot;), Confucius Mansion (&quot;Kong Fu&quot;) and the Temple of Yan Hui (&quot;Yan Miao&quot;) occupy large sections of the land within the wall.

The Confucius Cemetery (Kong Lin) is located to the north of the walled city. The modern downtown is located south of the walled city. There is also a mosque and a thriving Muslim neighborhood and market that is located just outside the west gate of the walled city.

The Qufu train station and major industrial areas are on the east side, a few kilometers east of the historical city. The Shaohao Tomb () and Shou Qiu historical site (, the purported birthplace of the legendary Yellow Emperor), are on the eastern outskirts of the modern Qufu as well, near Jiuxian village.

The Si River and the both pass through the city.

=== Climate ===
Qufu has a humid continental climate, bordering on a humid subtropical climate. Qufu experiences an average annual precipitation of , and an average annual temperature of .

==Transportation==

=== Rail transport ===
The original Beijing–Shanghai railway, constructed in the early 20th century, passes through Qufu. For a century, most passengers traveling to or from Qufu, would use the train station at Yanzhou, some to the west.

The Yanshi Railway, which connects Yanzhou and Rizhao as part of the broader Xinshi Railway (), passes through the city. A small passenger station operating on the southeast side of the city () serves this line.

The north–south Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, which opened in 2011, runs through Qufu. This line&#x27;s Qufu East railway station is located a few kilometers south-east of the city (). Qufu South railway station, on the east–west Rizhao–Lankao high-speed railway, opened in 2021.

=== Road transport ===
China National Highway 104 and China National Highway 327 both pass through Qufu.

=== Monorail ===
A , 12 station monorail to connect Qufu and Zoucheng began construction in the first half of 2017, however construction was halted. A section was due to be completed in January 2018 to allow for testing to commence. The complete line was originally due to open in 2018. As of July 2021 the local government hopes to complete the line.

==Temple of Confucius (Kong Miao)==

Within two years after the death of Confucius, his former house in Qufu was already consecrated as a temple by the Duke of Lu. In 205 BC, Emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty was the first emperor to offer sacrifices to the memory of Confucius in Qufu. He set an example for many emperors and high officials to follow. Later, emperors would visit Qufu after their enthronement or on important occasions such as a successful war. In total, 12 different emperors paid 20 personal visits to Qufu to worship Confucius. About 100 others sent their deputies for 196 official visits. The original three-room house of Confucius was removed from the temple complex during a rebuilding undertaken in 611 AD. In 1012 and in 1094, during the Song dynasty, the temple was extended into a design with three sections and four courtyards, around which eventually more than 400 rooms were arranged. Fire and vandalism destroyed the temple in 1214, during the Jin dynasty. It was restored to its former extent by the year 1302 during the Yuan dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 1331, the temple was framed in an enclosure wall modelled on the Imperial palace. After another devastation by fire in 1499, the temple was finally restored to its present scale. In 1724, yet another fire destroyed the main hall and the sculptures it contained. The subsequent restoration was completed in 1730. Many of the replacement sculptures were again destroyed during the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In total, the Temple of Confucius has undergone 15 major renovations, 31 large repairs, and numerous small building measures.

The temple complex is the second largest historical building complex in China (after the Forbidden City)—it covers an area of and has a total of 460 rooms. Because the last major redesign following the fire in 1499 took place shortly after the building of the Forbidden City in the Ming dynasty, the architecture of the Temple of Confucius resembles that of the Forbidden City in many ways. The main part of the temple consists of 9 courtyards arranged on a central axis, which is oriented in the north–south direction and is in length. The first three courtyards have small gates and are planted with tall pine trees, they serve an introductory function. The first (southernmost) gate is named &quot;Lingxing Gate&quot; after a star in the Great Bear constellation, the name suggests that Confucius is a star from heaven. The buildings in the remaining courtyards form the heart of the complex. They are impressive structures with yellow roof-tiles (otherwise reserved for the emperor) and red-painted walls, they are surrounded by dark-green pine trees to create a color contrast with complementary colors. The main buildings are the Stele Pavilions (e.g., Jin and Yuan dynasties, 1115–1368), the Kuiwen Hall (built in 1018, restored in 1504 during the Ming dynasty and in 1985), the Xing Tan Pavilion (, Apricot Platform), the De Mu Tian Di Arch, the Dacheng Hall (built in the Qing dynasty), and the Hall of Confucius&#x27; Wife. The Dacheng Hall (, &quot;Great Perfection Hall&quot;) is the architectural center of the present day complex. The hall covers an area of and stands slightly less than tall.

It is supported by 28 richly decorated pillars, each high and in diameter and carved in one piece out of local rock. The ten columns on the front side of the hall are decorated with coiled dragons. It is said that these columns were covered during visits by the emperor in order not to arouse his envy. Dacheng Hall served as the principal place for offering sacrifices to the memory of Confucius. In the center of the courtyard in front of Dacheng Hall stands the &quot;Apricot Platform&quot;, which commemorates Confucius teaching his students under an apricot tree. Each year at Qufu and at many other Confucian temples a ceremony is held on September 28 to commemorate Confucius&#x27; birthday.

==Cemetery of Confucius (Kong Lin)==
The Cemetery of Confucius () lies to the north of the town of Qufu. The oldest graves found in this location date back to the Zhou dynasty. The original tomb erected here in memory of Confucius on the bank of the Sishui River had the shape of an axe. In addition, it had a brick platform for sacrifices. The present-day tomb is a cone-shaped hill. Tombs for the descendants of Confucius and additional stela to commemorate him were soon added around Confucius&#x27; tomb.

Since Confucius&#x27; descendants were conferred noble titles and were given imperial princesses as wives, many of the tombs in the cemetery show the status symbols of noblemen. Tombstones came in use during the Han dynasty, today, there are about 3,600 tombstones dating from the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties still standing in the cemetery.

In 1331 construction work began on the wall and gate of the cemetery. In total, the cemetery has undergone 13 renovations and extensions. Eventually, by the late 18th century, the perimeter wall reached a length of , enclosing an area of . In this space, the tombs of more than 100,000 descendants of Confucius, who have been buried there over a period of about 2000 years, can be found. The oldest graves date back to the Zhou dynasty, the most recent of which belong to descendants in the 76th and 78th generation.

During the Cultural Revolution, the Kong family cemetery was branded a &quot;reactionary&quot; site and was subject to vandalism and desecration. The tombs of Confucius and his descendants were dug up, looted and flattened. Confucius statue was pulled down and paraded through the streets. According to statistics published after the Cultural Revolution, 100,000 volumes of classical texts were burned, 6,618 cultural artefacts were destroyed or damaged, one thousand stelae were smashed, 5,000 ancient pines were felled and over 2,000 graves were dug up during the period. 
The corpse of the 76th Duke of Qufu was removed from its grave, hung naked from a tree in front of the palace and later incinerated.

More than 10,000 mature trees give the cemetery a forest-like appearance. A road runs from the north gate of Qufu to the exterior gate of the cemetery in a straight line. It is in length and lined by cypresses and pine trees. Along this road lies the Yan Temple, dedicated to Confucius&#x27; favorite student.

==Kong Family Mansion (Kong Fu)==
The direct descendants of Confucius lived in the Kong family Mansion () located to the east of the temple. They were in charge of tending to the temple and cemetery. In particular, they were in charge of conducting elaborate religious ceremonies on occasions such as plantings, harvests, honoring the dead, and birthdays. The Kong family was in control of the largest private rural estate in China. The first mansion was built in 1038 during the Song dynasty and was originally connected directly to the temple. During a rebuilding in 1377 directed by the first Ming dynasty emperor, it was moved a short distance away from the temple. In 1503, it was expanded into three rows of buildings with 560 rooms and—like the Confucius Temple—9 courtyards. The mansion underwent a complete renovation in 1838 only to perish in a fire 47 years later in 1887. It was rebuilt two years later; the cost of both 19th-century renovations was covered by the Emperor. Today, the mansion comprises 152 buildings with 480 rooms, which cover an area of . Its tallest structure is the four-story refuge tower () that was designed as a shelter during an attack but was never used. The family mansion was inhabited by descendants of Confucius until 1937, when Confucius&#x27; descendant in the 76th and 77th generations fled to Chongqing during the Second Sino-Japanese War and later during the Chinese Civil War to Taiwan, where the head of the family still resides.

The layout of the mansion is traditionally Chinese, it separates official rooms in the front from the residential quarters in the rear. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the buildings according to the seniority, gender, and status of their inhabitants reflects the Confucian principle of order and hierarchy: The most senior descendant of Confucius took up residence in the central of the three main buildings; his younger brother occupied the Yi Gun hall to the east.

==Economy==
Qufu&#x27;s economy consists of a number different industries. Agriculture, specifically grain production, is a major industry for the city. The other main industries are food processing, textile, construction materials, chemical, coal mining, pharmacy, paper making and industrial machinery. Qufu has also benefited greatly from tourism, holding a number of cultural festivals and exhibitions, largely centered around Confucius.

=== Natural resources ===
The city&#x27;s main mineral deposits include coal, phosphorus, and limestone.

==Education==
Qufu Normal University is located in Qufu city, and has an additional campus in Rizhao. The university, founded in 1955, offers 87 undergraduate majors, 25 master&#x27;s degrees, and 11 doctoral degrees.

==Religion==
Qufu is a traditional centre of Confucianism, being the area where Confucius was born. The city is home to the holiest Temple of Confucius, to the Mausoleum of Confucius and to the Mansion of the Kong Family. The city also has a branch of the Holy Church of Confucius () and hosts the headquarters of the Federation of Confucian Culture.

<doc id="611480" wikidata="Q911176" url="?curid=611480" title="History of the Ryukyu Islands">
<text>This article is about the history of the Ryukyu Islands, located southwest of the main islands of Japan.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ryūkyū&quot; originates from Chinese writings. The earliest references to &quot;Ryūkyū&quot; write the name as and (, Middle Chinese: ) in the Chinese history &quot;Book of Sui&quot; in 607. It is a descriptive name, meaning &quot;glazed horn-dragon&quot;.

The origin of the term &quot;Okinawa&quot; remains unclear, although &quot;Okinawa&quot; (Okinawan: Uchinaa) as a term was used in Okinawa. There was also a divine woman named &quot;Uchinaa&quot; in the book &quot;Omoro Sōshi&quot;, a compilation of ancient poems and songs from Okinawa Island. This suggests the presence of a divine place named Okinawa. The Chinese monk Jianzhen, who traveled to Japan in the mid-8th century CE to promote Buddhism, wrote &quot;Okinawa&quot; as 阿児奈波 (). The Japanese map series Ryukyu Kuniezu labeled the island as in 1644. The current Chinese characters (kanji) for Okinawa (沖縄) were first written in the 1702 version of Ryukyu Kuniezu.

==Early history==

===Prehistoric period===
The ancestry of the modern-day Ryukyuan people is disputed. One theory claims that the earliest inhabitants of these islands crossed a prehistoric land bridge from modern-day China, with later additions of Austronesians, Micronesians, and Japanese merging with the population. The time when human beings appeared in Okinawa remains unknown. The earliest human bones were those of Yamashita Cave Man, about 32,000 years ago, followed by Pinza-Abu Cave Man, Miyakojima, about 26,000 years ago and Minatogawa Man, about 18,000 years ago. They probably came through China and were once considered to be the direct ancestors of those living in Okinawa. No stone tools were discovered with them. For the following 12 000 years, no trace of archaeological sites was discovered after the Minatogawa man site.

===Okinawa midden culture===
Okinawa midden culture or shell heap culture is divided into the early shell heap period corresponding to the Jōmon period of Japan and the latter shell heap period corresponding to the Yayoi period of Japan. However, the use of Jōmon and Yayoi of Japan is questionable in Okinawa. In the former, it was a hunter-gatherer society, with wave-like opening Jōmon pottery. In the latter part of Jōmon period, archaeological sites moved near the seashore, suggesting the engagement of people in fishery. In Okinawa, rice was not cultivated during the Yayoi period but began during the latter period of shell-heap age. Shell rings for arms made of shells obtained in the Sakishima Islands, namely Miyakojima and Yaeyama islands, were imported by Japan. In these islands, the presence of shell axes, 2500 years ago, suggests the influence of a southeastern-Pacific culture.

===Mythology, the Shunten Dynasty and the Eiso Dynasty===
The first history of Ryukyu was written in &quot;Chūzan Seikan&quot; (&quot;Mirrors of Chūzan&quot;), which was compiled by Shō Shōken (1617–75), also known as Haneji Chōshū. The Ryukyuan creation myth is told, which includes the establishment of Tenson as the first king of the islands and the creation of the &quot;Noro&quot;, female priestesses of the Ryukyuan religion. The throne was usurped from one of Tenson&#x27;s descendants by a man named Riyu. &quot;Chūzan Seikan&quot; then tells the story of a Japanese samurai, Minamoto no Tametomo (1139–70), who fought in the Hogen Rebellion of 1156 and fled first to Izu Island and then to Okinawa. He had relations with the sister of the Aji of Ōzato and sired Shunten, who then led a popular rebellion against Riyu and established his own rule at Urasoe Castle. Most historians, however, discount the Tametomo story as a revisionist history that is intended to legitimize Japanese domination over Okinawa. Shunten&#x27;s dynasty ended in the third generation when his grandson, Gihon, abdicated, went into exile, and was succeeded by Eiso, who began a new royal lineage. The Eiso dynasty continued for five generations.

===Gusuku period===
Gusuku is the term used for the distinctive Okinawan form of castles or fortresses. Many gusukus and related cultural remains in the Ryukyu Islands have been listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites under the title Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu. After the midden culture, agriculture started about the 12th century, with the center moving from the seashore to higher places. This period is called the gusuku period. There are three perspectives regarding the nature of gusukus: 1) a holy place, 2) dwellings encircled by stones, 3) a castle of a leader of people. In this period, porcelain trade between Okinawa and other countries became busy, and Okinawa became an important relay point in eastern-Asian trade. Ryukyuan kings, such as Shunten and Eiso, were considered to be important governors. In 1272, Kublai Khan ordered Ryukyu to submit to Mongol suzerainty, but King Eiso refused. In 1276, the Mongol envoys returned, but were driven off the island by the Ryukyuans.

==Three-Kingdom period==
The Three-Kingdom period, also known as the (Three Mountains), lasted from 1322 until 1429. There was a gradual consolidation of power under the Shō family. Shō Hashi (1372–1439) conquered Chūzan, the middle kingdom, in 1404 and made his father, Shō Shishō, the king. He conquered Hokuzan, the northern kingdom, in 1416 and conquered the southern kingdom, Nanzan, in 1429, thereby unifying the three kingdoms into a single Ryukyu Kingdom. Shō Hashi was then recognized as the ruler of the Ryukyu Kingdom (or Liuqiu Kingdom in Chinese) by the Ming dynasty Emperor of China, who presented him a red lacquerware plaque known as the Chūzan Tablet. Although independent, the kings of the Ryukyu Kingdom paid tribute to the rulers of China.

==Ryukyu Kingdom==
===1429–1609===

In 1429 King Shō Hashi completed the unification of the three kingdoms and founded a single Ryukyu Kingdom with its capital at Shuri Castle. (1465–1526; r. 1477–1526) became the third king of the Second Sho Dynasty; his reign has been described as the &quot;Great Days of Chūzan&quot;, a period of great peace and relative prosperity. He was the son of Shō En, the founder of the dynasty, by Yosoidon, Shō En&#x27;s second wife, often referred to as the queen-mother. He succeeded his uncle, Shō Sen&#x27;i, who was forced to abdicate in his favor. Much of the foundational organization of the kingdom&#x27;s administration and economy stemmed from developments which occurred during Shō Shin&#x27;s reign. The reign of Shō Shin also saw the expansion of the kingdom&#x27;s control over several of the outlying Ryukyu Islands, such as Miyako-jima and Ishigaki Island.

Many Chinese moved to Ryukyu to serve the government or to engage in business during this period. In 1392, during the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s reign, the Ming dynasty Chinese had sent 36 Chinese families from Fujian at the request of the Ryukyuan King to manage oceanic dealings in the kingdom. Many Ryukyuan officials descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers. They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations.

===Satsuma domination, 1609–1871===
The invasion of the Ryukyu Kingdom by the Shimazu clan of Japan&#x27;s Satsuma Domain took place in April 1609. Three thousand men and more than one hundred war-junks sailed from Kagoshima at the southern tip of Kyushu. The invaders defeated the Ryukyuans in the Amami Islands, then at Nakijin Castle on Okinawa Island. The Satsuma samurai made a second landing near Yomitanzan and marched overland to Urasoe Castle, which they captured. Their war-junks attempted to take the port city of Naha, but were defeated by the Ryūkyūan coastal defences. Finally Satsuma captured Shuri Castle, the Ryukyuan capital, and King Shō Nei. Only at this point did the King famously tell his army that &quot;nuchidu takara&quot; (life is a treasure), and they surrendered. Many priceless cultural treasures were looted and taken to Kagoshima. As a result of the war, the Amami Islands were ceded to Satsuma in 1611; the direct rule of Satsuma over the Amami Islands started in 1613.

After 1609 the Ryukyuan kings became vassals of Satsuma. Though recognized as an independent kingdom, the islands were occasionally also referred to as being a province of Japan. The Shimazu introduced a policy banning sword ownership by commoners. This led to the development of the indigenous Okinawan martial arts, which utilize domestic items as weapons. This period of effective outside control also featured the first international matches of Go, as Ryukyuan players came to Japan to test their skill. This occurred in 1634, 1682, and 1710.

In the 17th century the Ryukyu kingdom thus became both a tributary of China and a vassal of Japan. Because China would not make a formal trade agreement unless a country was a tributary state, the kingdom served as a convenient loophole for Japanese trade with China. When Japan officially closed foreign trade, the only exceptions for foreign trade were with the Dutch through Nagasaki, with the Ryukyu Kingdom through the Satsuma Domain, and with Korea through Tsushima. Perry&#x27;s &quot;Black Ships&quot;, official envoys from the United States, came in 1853. In 1871, the Mudan incident occurred, in which fifty-four Ryukyuans were killed in Taiwan. They had wandered into the central part of Taiwan after their ship was wrecked.

===Ryukyu Domain, 1872–1879===

In 1872 the Ryukyu Kingdom was reconfigured as a feudal domain (&quot;han&quot;). The people were described as appearing to be a &quot;connecting link&quot; between the Chinese and Japanese. After the Taiwan Expedition of 1874, Japan&#x27;s role as the protector of the Ryukyuan people was acknowledged; but the fiction of the Ryukyu Kingdom&#x27;s independence was partially maintained until 1879. In 1878 the islands were listed as a &quot;tributary&quot; to Japan. The largest island was listed as &quot;Tsju San&quot;, meaning &quot;middle island&quot;. Others were listed as Sannan in the south and Sanbok in the North Nawa. The main port was listed as &quot;Tsju San&quot;. It was open to foreign trade.
Agricultural produce included tea, rice, sugar, tobacco, camphor, fruits, and silk. Manufactured products included cotton, paper, porcelain, and lacquered ware.

==Okinawa Prefecture, 1879–1937==
In 1879, Japan declared its intention to annex the Ryukyu Kingdom. China protested and asked former U.S. President Ulysses Grant, then on a diplomatic tour of Asia, to intercede. One option considered involved Japan annexing the islands from Amami Island north, China annexing the Miyako and Yaeyama islands, and the central islands remaining an independent Ryukyu Kingdom. When the negotiation eventually failed, Japan annexed the entire Ryukyu archipelago. Thus, the Ryukyu &quot;han&quot; was abolished and replaced by Okinawa Prefecture by the Meiji government. The monarchy in Shuri was abolished and the deposed king Shō Tai (1843–1901) was forced to relocate to Tokyo. In compensation, he was made a marquis in the Meiji system of peerage.

Hostility against mainland Japan increased in the Ryukyus immediately after its annexation to Japan in part because of the systematic attempt on the part of mainland Japan to eliminate the Ryukyuan culture, including the language, religion, and cultural practices. Japan introduced public education that permitted only the use of standard Japanese while shaming students who used their own language by forcing them to wear plaques around their necks proclaiming them &quot;dialect speakers&quot;. This increased the number of Japanese language speakers on the islands, creating a link with the mainland. When Japan became the dominant power of the Far East, many Ryukyuans were proud of being citizens of the Empire. However, there was always an undercurrent of dissatisfaction for being treated as second class citizens.

==Okinawa and World War II==
In the years leading up to World War II, the Japanese government sought to reinforce national solidarity in the interests of militarization. In part, they did so by means of conscription, mobilization, and nationalistic propaganda. Many of the people of the Ryukyu Islands, despite having spent only a generation as full Japanese citizens, were interested in proving their value to Japan in spite of prejudice expressed by mainland Japanese people.

In 1943, during World War II, the US president asked its ally, the Republic of China, if it would lay claim to the Ryukyus after the war. &quot;The President then referred to the question of the Ryukyu Islands and enquired more than once whether China would want the Ryukyus. The Generalissimo replied that China would be agreeable to joint occupation of the Ryukyus by China and the United States and, eventually, joint administration by the two countries under the trusteeship of an international organization.&quot; On March 23, 1945, the United States began its attack on the island of Okinawa, the final outlying islands, prior to the expected invasion of mainland Japan.

=== Battle of Okinawa: April 1 – June 22, 1945 ===
The Battle of Okinawa was one of the last major battles of World War II, claiming the lives of an estimated 120,000 combatants. The Ryukyus were the only inhabited part of Japan to experience a land battle during World War II. In addition to the Japanese military personnel who died in the Battle for Okinawa, well over one third of the civilian population, which numbered approximately 300,000 people, were killed. Many important documents, artifacts, and sites related to Ryukyuan history and culture were also destroyed, including the royal Shuri Castle. Americans had expected the Okinawan people to welcome them as liberators but the Japanese had used propaganda to make the Okinawans fearful of Americans. As a result, some Okinawans joined militias and fought along Japanese. This was a major cause of the civilian casualties, as Americans could not distinguish between combatants and civilians.

Due to fears concerning their fate during and after the invasion, the Okinawan people hid in caves and in family tombs. Several mass deaths occurred, such as in the &quot;Cave of the Virgins&quot;, where many Okinawan school girls committed suicide by jumping off cliffs for fear of rape. Similarly, whole families committed suicide or were killed by near relatives in order to avoid suffering what they believed would be a worse fate at the hands of American forces; for instance, on Zamami Island at Zamami Village, almost everyone living on the island committed suicide two days after Americans landed. The Americans had made plans to safeguard the Okinawans; their fears were not unfounded, as killing of civilians and destruction of civilian property did take place; for example, on Aguni Island, 90 residents were killed and 150 houses were destroyed.

As the fighting intensified, Japanese soldiers hid in caves with civilians, further increasing civilian casualties. Additionally, Japanese soldiers shot Okinawans who attempted to surrender to Allied Forces. America utilized Nisei Okinawans in psychological warfare, broadcasting in Okinawan, leading to the Japanese belief that Okinawans who did not speak Japanese were spies or disloyal to Japan, or both. These people were often killed as a result. As food became scarce, some civilians were killed over small amounts of food. &quot;At midnight, soldiers would wake up Okinawans and take them to the beach. Then they chose Okinawans at random and threw hand grenades at them.&quot;

Massive casualties in the Yaeyama Islands caused the Japanese military to force people to evacuate from their towns to the mountains, even though malaria was prevalent there. Fifty-four percent of the island&#x27;s population died due to starvation and disease. Later, islanders unsuccessfully sued the Japanese government. Many military historians believe that the ferocity of the Battle of Okinawa led directly to the American decision to use the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A prominent holder of this view is Victor Davis Hanson, who states it explicitly in his book &quot;Ripples of Battle&quot;: &quot;because the Japanese on Okinawa, including native Okinawans, were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan, other than a direct invasion.&quot;

===Princess Lilies===
After the beginning of World War II, the Japanese military conscripted school girls (15 to 16 years old) to join a group known as the &quot;Princess Lilies&quot; (&quot;Hime-yuri&quot;) and to go to the battle front as nurses. There were seven girls&#x27; high schools in Okinawa at the time of World War II. The board of education, made up entirely of mainland Japanese, required the girls&#x27; participation. The Princess Lilies were organized at two of them, and a total of 297 students and teachers eventually joined the group. Teachers, who insisted that the students be evacuated to somewhere safe, were accused of being traitors.

Most of the girls were put into temporary clinics in caves to take care of injured soldiers. With a severe shortage of food, water and medicine, 211 of the girls died while trying to care for the wounded soldiers. The Japanese military had told these girls that, if they were taken as prisoners, the enemy would rape and kill them; the military gave hand grenades to the girls to allow them to commit suicide rather than be taken as prisoners. One of the Princess Lilies explained: &quot;We had a strict imperial education, so being taken prisoner was the same as being a traitor. We were taught to prefer suicide to becoming a captive.&quot; Many students died saying, &quot;Tennō Heika Banzai&quot;, which means &quot;Long live the Emperor&quot;.

==Post-war occupation==
After the war, the islands were occupied by the United States and were initially governed by the United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands from 1945 to 1950 when it was replaced by the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands from 1950 which also established the Government of the Ryukyu Islands in 1952. The Treaty of San Francisco which went into effect in 1952, officially ended wartime hostilities. However, ever since the battle of Okinawa, the presence of permanent American bases has created friction between Okinawans and the U.S. military. During the occupation, American military personnel were exempt from domestic jurisdiction since Okinawa was an occupied territory of the United States.

Effective U.S. control continued even after the end of the occupation of Japan as a whole in 1952. The United States dollar was the official currency used, and cars drove on the right, American-style, as opposed to on the left as in Japan. The islands switched to driving on the left in 1978, six years after they were returned to Japanese control. The U.S. used their time as occupiers to build large army, air force, navy, and marine bases on Okinawa.

On November 21, 1969, a Joint Communique was issued by President Nixon and Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, with the US president agreeing to return the Ryukyus to Japan in 1972. U.S. President Richard Nixon and Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Satō later signed the &quot;Okinawa Reversion Agreement&quot; in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1971. The U.S. reverted the islands to Japan on May 15, 1972, setting back a Ryūkyū independence movement that had emerged. Under terms of the agreement, the U.S. retained its rights to bases on the island as part of the 1952 Treaty to protect Japan, but those bases were to be nuclear-free. The United States military still controls about 19% of the island, making the 30,000 American servicemen a dominant feature in island life. While the Americans provide jobs to the locals on base, and in tourist venues, and pay rent on the land, widespread personal relationships between U.S. servicemen and Okinawan women remain controversial in Okinawan society. Okinawa remains Japan&#x27;s poorest prefecture.

===Agent Orange controversy===

Evidence suggests that the US military&#x27;s Project 112 tested biochemical agents on US marines in Okinawa in the 1960s.
Later, suggestions were made that the US may have stored and used Agent Orange at its bases and training areas on the island. In at least one location where Agent Orange was reportedly used, there have been incidences of leukemia among locals, one of the listed effects of Agent Orange exposure. Drums that were unearthed in 2002 in one of the reported disposal locations were seized by the Okinawa Defense Bureau, an agency of Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Defense, which has not issued a report on what the drums contained. The United States denies that Agent Orange was ever present on Okinawa. Thirty US military veterans claim that they saw Agent Orange on the island. Three of them have been awarded related disability benefits by the US Veteran&#x27;s administration. The locations of suspected Agent Orange contamination include Naha port, Higashi, Camp Schwab, and Chatan. In May 2012, it was claimed that the US transport ship &quot;USNS Schuyler Otis Bland (T-AK-277)&quot; had transported herbicides to Okinawa on 25 April 1962. The defoliant might have been tested in Okinawa&#x27;s northern area between Kunigami and Higashi by the US Army&#x27;s 267th Chemical Service Platoon to assess its potential usefulness in Vietnam. A retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel, Kris Roberts, told &quot;The Japan Times&quot; that his base maintenance team unearthed leaking barrels of unknown chemicals at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in 1981. In 2012 a US Army environmental assessment report, published in 2003, was discovered which stated that 25,000 55-gallon drums of Agent Orange had been stored on Okinawa before being taken to Johnston Atoll for disposal. In February 2013, an internal US DoD investigation concluded that no Agent Orange had been transported to, stored, or used on Okinawa. No veterans or former base workers were interviewed for the investigation.

===Prosecution under Status of Forces Agreement===
After Okinawa reunited with Japan in 1972, Japan immediately signed a treaty with the U.S. so that the American military could stay in Okinawa. The legal agreement remained the same. If American military personnel were accused of a crime in Okinawa, the US military retained jurisdiction to try them as part of the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) if the victim were another American or if the offense were committed during the execution of official duties. This is routine for military service people stationed in foreign countries.

In 1995, two Marines and a sailor kidnapped and raped a 12-year-old girl, and, under the SOFA with the U.S., local police and prosecutors were unable to get access to the troops until they were able to prepare an indictment. What angered many Okinawans in this instance was that the suspects were not handed over to Japanese police until after they had been formally indicted in an Okinawan court, although they were apprehended by American military law enforcement authorities the day after the rape and confined in a navy brig until then. In the Michael Brown Okinawa assault incident, a US Marine officer was convicted of attempted indecent assault and destruction of private property involving a local resident of Filipino descent who worked at Camp Courtney.

In February, 2008, a U.S. Marine was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-year-old Japanese girl in Okinawa, and a member of the U.S. Army was suspected of raping a Filipino woman in Okinawa. U.S. Ambassador Thomas Schieffer flew to Okinawa and met with Okinawa governor Hirokazu Nakaima to express U.S. concern over the cases and offer cooperation in the investigation. U.S. Forces Japan designated February 22 as a &quot;Day of Reflection&quot; for all U.S. military facilities in Japan, setting up a Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Task Force in an effort to prevent similar incidents.

===Planned development of American bases===
Base-related revenue makes up 5% of the total economy. If the U.S. vacated the land, it is claimed that the island would be able to generate more money from tourism by the increased land available for development. In the 1990s, a Special Actions Committee was set up to prepare measures to ease tensions, most notably the return of approximately to the Japanese state.

Other complaints are that the military bases disrupt the lives of the Okinawan people; the American military occupy more than a fifth of the main island. The biggest and most active air force base in east Asia, Kadena Air Base, is based on the island; the islanders complain the base produces large amounts of noise and is dangerous in other ways. In 1959 a jet fighter crashed into a school on the island, killing 17 children and injuring 121. On August 13, 2004, a U.S. military helicopter crashed into Okinawa International University, injuring the three crew members on board. The U.S. military arrived on scene first then physically barred local police from participating in the investigation of the crash. The US did not allow local authorities to examine the scene until six days after the crash. In a similar manner, unexploded ordnance from WWII continues to be a danger, especially in sparsely-populated areas where it may have lain undisturbed or been buried.

<text>The Ryukyu Kingdom was a kingdom in the Ryukyu Islands from 1429 to 1879. It was ruled as a tributary state of imperial Ming China by the Ryukyuan monarchy, who unified Okinawa Island to end the Sanzan period, and extended the kingdom to the Amami Islands and Sakishima Islands. The Ryukyu Kingdom played a central role in the maritime trade networks of medieval East Asia and Southeast Asia despite its small size. The Ryukyu Kingdom became a vassal state of the Satsuma Domain of Japan after the invasion of Ryukyu in 1609 but retained &quot;de jure&quot; independence until it was transformed into the Ryukyu Domain by the Empire of Japan in 1872. The Ryukyu Kingdom was formally annexed and dissolved by Japan in 1879 to form Okinawa Prefecture, and the Ryukyuan monarchy was integrated into the new Japanese nobility.

== Royal Crest ==
The family crest of the Ryukyuan kings is called Mitsu-domoe and it is commonly used in Japan.

In Shintoism, Mitsu-domoe represents Emperor Ojin (Divine name Yahata). King Shō Toku worshshipped Yahata and adapted the crest. He has also built the Asato Hachiman Shrine.

It is also said to be a balance of three forces, symbolizing the balance of Kitayama, Nakayama, and Nanzan.

== History ==
=== Origins of the Kingdom ===

In the 14th century small domains scattered on Okinawa Island were unified into three principalities: , , and . This was known as the period. Hokuzan, which constituted much of the northern half of the island, was the largest in terms of land area and military strength but was economically the weakest of the three. Nanzan constituted the southern portion of the island. Chūzan lay in the center of the island and was economically the strongest. Its political capital at Shuri, Nanzan was adjacent to the major port of Naha, and Kume-mura, the center of traditional Chinese education. These sites and Chūzan as a whole would continue to form the center of the Ryukyu Kingdom until its abolition.

Many Chinese people moved to Ryukyu to serve the government or to engage in business during this period. At the request of the Ryukyuan King, the Ming Chinese sent thirty-six Chinese families from Fujian to manage oceanic dealings in the kingdom in 1392, during the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s reign. Many Ryukyuan officials were descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers. They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations. On 30 January 1406, the Yongle Emperor expressed horror when the Ryukyuans castrated some of their own children to become eunuchs to serve in the Ming imperial palace. Emperor Yongle said that the boys who were castrated were innocent and did not deserve castration, and he returned them to Ryukyu, and instructed the kingdom not to send eunuchs again.

These three principalities (tribal federations led by major chieftains) battled, and Chūzan emerged victorious. The Chūzan leaders were officially recognized by Ming dynasty China as the rightful kings over those of Nanzan and Hokuzan, thus lending great legitimacy to their claims. The ruler of Chūzan passed his throne to King Hashi; Hashi conquered Hokuzan in 1416 and Nanzan in 1429, uniting the island of Okinawa for the first time, and founded the first Shō dynasty. Hashi was granted the surname &quot;Shō&quot; () by the Ming emperor in 1421, becoming known as Shō Hashi ().

Shō Hashi adopted the Chinese hierarchical court system, built Shuri Castle and the town as his capital, and constructed Naha harbor. When in 1469 King Shō Toku, who was a grandson of Shō Hashi, died without a male heir, a palatine servant declared he was Toku&#x27;s adopted son and gained Chinese investiture. This pretender, Shō En, began the Second Shō dynasty. Ryukyu&#x27;s golden age occurred during the reign of Shō Shin, the second king of that dynasty, who reigned from 1478 to 1526.

The kingdom extended its authority over the southernmost islands in the Ryukyu archipelago by the end of the 15th century, and by 1571 the Amami Ōshima Islands, to the north near Kyūshū, were incorporated into the kingdom as well. While the kingdom&#x27;s political system was adopted and the authority of Shuri recognized, in the Amami Ōshima Islands, the kingdom&#x27;s authority over the Sakishima Islands to the south remained for centuries at the level of a tributary-suzerain relationship.

===Golden age of maritime trade===
For nearly two hundred years the Ryukyu Kingdom would thrive as a key player in maritime trade with Southeast and East Asia. Central to the kingdom&#x27;s maritime activities was the continuation of the tributary relationship with Ming dynasty China, begun by Chūzan in 1372, and enjoyed by the three Okinawan kingdoms which followed it. China provided ships for Ryukyu&#x27;s maritime trade activities, allowed a limited number of Ryukyuans to study at the Imperial Academy in Beijing, and formally recognized the authority of the King of Chūzan, allowing the kingdom to trade formally at Ming ports. Ryukyuan ships, often provided by China, traded at ports throughout the region, which included, among others, China, Đại Việt (Vietnam), Japan, Java, Korea, Luzon, Malacca, Pattani, Palembang, Siam, and Sumatra.

Japanese products—silver, swords, fans, lacquerware, folding screens—and Chinese products—medicinal herbs, minted coins, glazed ceramics, brocades, textiles—were traded within the kingdom for Southeast Asian sappanwood, rhino horn, tin, sugar, iron, ambergris, Indian ivory, and Arabian frankincense. Altogether, 150 voyages between the kingdom and Southeast Asia on Ryukyuan ships were recorded in the &quot;Rekidai Hōan&quot;, an official record of diplomatic documents compiled by the kingdom, as having taken place between 1424 and the 1630s, with 61 of them bound for Siam, 10 for Malacca, 10 for Pattani, and 8 for Java, among others.

The Chinese policy of &quot;haijin&quot; (, &quot;sea bans&quot;), limiting trade with China to tributary states and those with formal authorization, along with the accompanying preferential treatment of the Ming Court towards Ryukyu, allowed the kingdom to flourish and prosper for roughly 150 years. In the late 16th century, however, the kingdom&#x27;s commercial prosperity fell into decline. The rise of the &quot;wokou&quot; threat among other factors led to the gradual loss of Chinese preferential treatment; the kingdom also suffered from increased maritime competition from Portuguese traders.

===Japanese invasion and subordination===

Around 1590, Toyotomi Hideyoshi asked the Ryukyu Kingdom to aid in his campaign to conquer Korea. If successful, Hideyoshi intended to then move against China. As the Ryukyu Kingdom was a tributary state of the Ming dynasty, the request was refused. The Tokugawa shogunate that emerged following Hideyoshi&#x27;s fall authorized the Shimazu family—feudal lords of the Satsuma domain (present-day Kagoshima Prefecture)—to send an expeditionary force to conquer the Ryukyus. The subsequent invasion took place in 1609, but Satsuma still allowed the Ryukyu Kingdom to find itself in a period of &quot;dual subordination&quot; to Japan and China, wherein Ryukyuan tributary relations were maintained with both the Tokugawa shogunate and the Chinese court.

Occupation occurred fairly quickly, with some fierce fighting, and King Shō Nei was taken prisoner to Kagoshima and later to Edo (modern-day Tokyo). To avoid giving the Qing any reason for military action against Japan, the king was released two years later and the Ryukyu Kingdom regained a degree of autonomy. However, the Satsuma domain seized control over some territory of the Ryukyu Kingdom, notably the Amami-Ōshima island group, which was incorporated into the Satsuma domain and remains a part of Kagoshima Prefecture, not Okinawa Prefecture.

The kingdom was described by Hayashi Shihei in &quot;Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu&quot;, which was published in 1785.

===Tributary relations===

In 1655, tribute relations between Ryukyu and Qing dynasty (the China&#x27;s dynasty that followed Ming after 1644) were formally approved by the shogunate. This was seen to be justified, in part, because of the desire to avoid giving Qing any reason for military action against Japan.

Since Ming China prohibited trade with Japan, the Satsuma domain, with the blessing of the Tokugawa shogunate, used the trade relations of the kingdom to continue to maintain trade relations with China. Considering that Japan had previously severed ties with most European countries except the Dutch, such trade relations proved especially crucial to both the Tokugawa shogunate and Satsuma domain, which would use its power and influence, gained in this way, to help overthrow the shogunate in the 1860s. Ryukyuan missions to Edo for Tokugawa Shōgun.

The Ryukyuan king was a vassal of the Satsuma &quot;daimyō&quot;, after Shimazu&#x27;s Ryukyu invasion in 1609, the Satsuma Clan established a governmental office&#x27;s branch known as &quot;Zaibankaiya&quot; (在番仮屋) or &quot;Ufukaiya&quot; (大仮屋) at Shuri in 1628, and became the base of Ryukyu domination for 250 years, until 1872. The Satsuma Domain&#x27;s residents can be roughly compared to a European resident in a protectorate. But the kingdom was not considered as part of any &quot;han&quot; (fief): up until the formal annexation of the islands and abolition of the kingdom in 1879, the Ryukyus were not truly considered &quot;de jure&quot; part of Edo Japan. Though technically under the control of Satsuma, Ryukyu was given a great degree of autonomy, to best serve the interests of the Satsuma &quot;daimyō&quot; and those of the shogunate, in trading with China. Ryukyu was a tributary state of China, and since Japan had no formal diplomatic relations with China, it was essential that China not realize that Ryukyu was controlled by Japan. Thus, Satsuma—and the shogunate—was obliged to be mostly hands-off in terms of not visibly or forcibly occupying Ryukyu or controlling the policies and laws there. The situation benefited all three parties involved—the Ryukyu royal government, the Satsuma &quot;daimyō&quot;, and the shogunate—to make Ryukyu seem as much a distinctive and foreign country as possible. Japanese were prohibited from visiting Ryukyu without shogunal permission, and the Ryukyuans were forbidden from adopting Japanese names, clothes, or customs. They were even forbidden from divulging their knowledge of the Japanese language during their trips to Edo; the Shimazu family, &quot;daimyōs&quot; of Satsuma, gained great prestige by putting on a show of parading the King, officials, and other people of Ryukyu to and through Edo. As the only &quot;han&quot; to have a king and an entire kingdom as vassals, Satsuma gained significantly from Ryukyu&#x27;s exoticness, reinforcing that it was an entirely separate kingdom.

According to statements by Qing imperial official Li Hongzhang in a meeting with Ulysses S. Grant, China had a special relationship with the island and the Ryukyu had paid tribute to China for hundreds of years, and the Chinese reserved certain trade rights for them in an amicable and beneficial relationship. Japan ordered tributary relations to end in 1875 after the tribute mission of 1874 was perceived as a show of submission to China.

===Annexation by the Japanese Empire===

In 1872, Emperor Meiji unilaterally declared that the kingdom was then Ryukyu Domain. At the same time, the appearance of independence was maintained for diplomatic reasons with Qing China until the Meiji government abolished the Ryukyu Kingdom when the islands were incorporated as Okinawa Prefecture on 27 March 1879. The Amami-Ōshima island group which had been integrated into Satsuma Domain became a part of Kagoshima Prefecture.

The last king of Ryukyu was forced to relocate to Tokyo, and was given a compensating &quot;kazoku&quot; rank as Marquis Shō Tai. Many royalist supporters fled to China. The king&#x27;s death in 1901 diminished the historic connections with the former kingdom. With the abolition of the aristocracy after World War II, the Sho family continues to live in Tokyo.

<doc id="611485" wikidata="Q5589512" url="?curid=611485" title="Governor-General of the Bahamas">
<text>The governor-general of The Bahamas is the representative of the Bahamian monarch, currently King Charles III, in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. The governor-general is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister of The Bahamas. The functions of the governor-general include appointing ministers, judges, and ambassadors; giving royal assent to legislation passed by parliament; issuing writs for election.

In general, the governor-general observes the conventions of the Westminster system and responsible government, maintaining political neutrality, and has to always act only on the advice of the prime minister. The governor-general also has a ceremonial role: hosting events at the official residenceGovernment House in the capital, Nassauand bestowing honours to individuals and groups who are contributing to The Bahamas and to their communities. When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of The Bahamas and its monarch. The governor-general is supported by a staff headed by the official secretary to the governor-general.

Governors-general formally serve &quot;at the monarch&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. Since 1 September 2023, the governor-general has been Dame Cynthia A. Pratt.

The office of the governor-general was created on 10 July 1973, when The Bahamas gained independence from the United Kingdom as a sovereign state and an independent constitutional monarchy. Since then, 12 individuals have served as governor-general.

==Appointment==
The governor-general is formally appointed by the monarch of the Bahamas. When a new governor-general is to be appointed, the prime minister recommends a name to the monarch, who by convention accepts that recommendation. At the installation ceremony, the new governor-general takes oaths of allegiance and of office. These oaths are administered by the chief justice of the Bahamas.

The oath for the due execution of the office of governor-general is:

==Functions==

The Bahamas shares the person of the sovereign equally with 14 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. As the sovereign works and resides predominantly outside of Bahamian borders, the governor-general&#x27;s primary task is to perform the monarch&#x27;s constitutional duties on his or her behalf. As such, the governor-general carries out his or her functions in the government of The Bahamas on behalf and in the name of the Sovereign.

The governor-general&#x27;s powers and duties are derived from the Bahamian constitution&#x27;s Section 32 to 37, which set out certain provisions relating to the governor-general.

===Constitutional role===

The governor-general is responsible for dissolving parliament and issues writs for new elections. After an election, the governor-general formally requests the leader of the political party which gains the support of a majority in parliament to form a government. The governor-general commissions the prime minister and appoints other ministers after the election.

The governor-general, on the Sovereign&#x27;s behalf, gives royal assent to laws passed by the Parliament of The Bahamas.

The governor-general acts on the advice of the prime minister, to issue regulations, proclamations under existing laws, to appoint state judges, ambassadors and high commissioners to overseas countries, and other senior government officials.

The governor-general is also responsible for issuing Royal Commissions of Inquiry, and other matters, as required by particular legislation; and authorises many other executive decisions by ministers such as approving treaties with foreign governments.

The governor-general may, in certain circumstances, exercise without—or contrary to—ministerial advice. These are known as the reserve powers, and include:
*appointing a prime minister if an election has resulted in a &#x27;hung parliament&#x27;.
*dismissing the prime minister who has lost the confidence of the parliament.
*dismissing any minister acting unlawfully.
*refusing to dissolve the House of Representatives despite a request from the prime minister.

===Ceremonial role===

The governor-general&#x27;s ceremonial duties include opening new sessions of parliament by delivering the Speech from the Throne, welcoming visiting heads of state, and receiving the credentials of foreign diplomats.

The governor-general also presents honours at investitures to Bahamians for notable service to the community, or for acts of bravery.

===Community role===

The governor-general provides non-partisan leadership in the community, acting as patron of many charitable, service, sporting and cultural organisations, and attending functions throughout the country.

The governor-general also encourages, articulates and represents those things that unite Bahamians together. In this role, the governor-general:

*frequently receives Bahamians on special occasions or celebrations, students of various schools, and visitors from other countries at Government House.
*attends church services, religious observances, and charitable, social, and civic events across the country.
*accepts patronage of many national, charitable, cultural, educational, sporting and professional organisations.
*issues congratulatory messages to Bahamian organisations for special anniversaries and events, such as major national or international conferences, cultural festivals and sporting championships.

==Privileges==

Through the passage of the &quot;National Honours Act 2016&quot;, The Bahamas established seven national orders in 2016. The governor-general, serves as the Chancellor of all these orders.
===Salary===

The governor-general receives an annual salary of 75,000 BSD.

===Symbols===

The governor-general uses a personal flag, which features a lion passant atop a St. Edward&#x27;s royal crown with &quot;Commonwealth of The Bahamas&quot; written on a scroll underneath, all on a blue background. It is flown on buildings and other locations in The Bahamas to mark the governor-general&#x27;s presence.

===Residence===

Government House in Nassau is the official residence of the governor-general of The Bahamas.

It was built between 1803 and 1806 and has served as the official residence and office of all Bahamian governors-general since independence in 1973.

<text>Perth is a town in the Australian Island of Tasmania. It lies south of Launceston, on the Midland Highway. The town had a population of 3,233 at the 2021 census, and is part of the Northern Midlands Council.

Like nearby Longford, Perth is a historic town with many buildings dating back to the early 19th century. It is the first major town out of Launceston on the route to Hobart, and also serves as a major junction for people bypassing Launceston on the route from Hobart to the northwest of the state.

==History==
Perth was settled in 1821 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. He was staying nearby with the pastoralist David Gibson and named it after Gibson&#x27;s hometown of Perth, Scotland. It was proclaimed as a township in 1836.
John Skinner Prout painted a view of the town in 1845, with various parts of the inland mountains showing in the painting. Edward Paxham Brandard engraved the picture in 1874.

==Landmarks==
=== Baptist church ===
The Perth Baptist church, opened in 1862, is notable, due to its history, size and architecture.
=== Gibbet Hill ===

In 1837, five years after the practice ceased in England, the body of John McKay was gibbetted near the spot where he murdered Joseph Wilson near Perth. There was great outcry, but the body was not removed until an acquaintance of Wilson passed the spot and, horrified by the spectacle of McKay&#x27;s rotting corpse, pleaded with the authorities to remove it.

The location is still marked by a sign reading, &quot;Gibbet Hill&quot; on the right when heading to Launceston.

This was the last case of gibbeting in a British colony.

== Demographics ==
The population of Perth was 2,965 in the 2016 Census. It had grown to 3,233 people in the 2021 Census.

<text>Daren James Puppa (born March 23, 1965) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender in the NHL. During his career, he played for the Buffalo Sabres, Tampa Bay Lightning, and the Toronto Maple Leafs. He won the 1985 NCAA Championship with the RPI Engineers. He is the cousin of NHL hockey player Ralph Backstrom.

== Career biography ==
Born in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, Puppa started his professional career in 1985, splitting time between the Buffalo Sabres and the AHL&#x27;s Rochester Americans. Aged 20 years, 223 days, he made his NHL debut on November 1, 1985, and posted a 2-0 shutout win over the Edmonton Oilers. 
He was the starting goalie for the Amerks in the 1986-1987 season when the team won the Calder Cup.
Following the trade of Buffalo&#x27;s all-star goaltender Tom Barrasso to the Pittsburgh Penguins early in the 1988–89 season, Puppa battled Jacques Cloutier to establish himself as the Sabres&#x27; number one goalie, and the following season Puppa led the league with 31 wins in 56 games. In the 1992–93 season he was traded to the Maple Leafs, but played only eight games for them before being claimed by the Lightning via the Panthers in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft. In 1995–96. Puppa&#x27;s stellar goaltending was a major factor in the Lightning earning their first playoff berth in team history. The team took the heavily favoured Philadelphia Flyers to six games before losing in the first round. Puppa&#x27;s solid goaltending in the 1995-96 season earned him his second Vezina nomination; he was second runner-up behind the ultimate winner, Jim Carey.
However, the next season Puppa developed chronic back trouble, and only played six games for the entire season. He only played 44 more games over the next four years, and he was forced to retire midway through the 1999–2000 season.

In addition to his 1996 nomination, Puppa also was the runner up to Patrick Roy for the 1989–1990 Vezina Trophy, awarded to the best NHL goaltender each year.

Puppa and his wife Meg have three children. The family resides in Tampa, Florida.

In 2019, Puppa returned to the ice in a game for the Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team while on a visit to Buffalo. Puppa, whose back problems and lingering effects from a 1989 shoulder injury still limit his mobility (he had not played hockey at any level since 2001 because of those injuries), led the Sabres alumni to a win.

<doc id="611493" wikidata="Q138559" url="?curid=611493" title="Lord William Bentinck">
<text>Lieutenant General Lord William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck (14 September 177417 June 1839), known as Lord William Bentinck, was a British military commander and politician who served as the governor of Fort William (Bengal) from 1828 to 1834 and the first governor-general of India from 1834 to 1835.

He has been credited for significant social and educational reforms in India, including abolishing sati, forbidding women to witness the cremations on the ghats of Varanasi, suppressing female infanticide and human sacrifice. Bentinck said, &quot;the dreadful responsibility hanging over his head in this world and the next, if… he was to consent to the continuance of this practice (sati) one moment longer.&quot; Bentinck after consultation with the army and officials passed the Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829. The challenge came from the Dharma Sabha which appealed in the Privy Council, however the ban on Sati was upheld. He reduced lawlessness by eliminating thuggee – which had existed for over 450 years – with the aid of his chief captain, William Henry Sleeman. Along with Thomas Babington Macaulay he introduced English as the language of instruction in India. Mysore was annexed under his presidency.

==Background==
Bentinck was born in Buckinghamshire, the second son of Prime Minister William Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, and Lady Dorothy (née Cavendish), only daughter of William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire. On the marriage the family name became &quot;Cavendish-Bentinck&quot;.

He was educated at Westminster School, a boys&#x27; public school in Westminster, London.

==Early career==
In 1783, at the age of 9, he was given the sinecure of Clerk of the Pipe for life.

Bentinck joined the Coldstream Guards on 28 January 1791 at the age of 16, purchasing an ensign&#x27;s commission. He was promoted to captain-lieutenant (lieutenant) in the 2nd Regiment of Dragoons on 4 August 1792, and to captain in the 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons on 6 April 1793. He was promoted to major in the 28th Foot on 29 March 1794 and to lieutenant-colonel in the 24th Dragoons that July. On 9 January 1798, Bentinck was promoted to colonel. In 1803 he was, to some surprise, appointed Governor of Madras, and was promoted to major-general on 1 January 1805. Although his tenure was moderately successful, it was brought to an end by the Vellore Mutiny in 1806, prompted by Bentinck&#x27;s order that the native troops be forbidden to wear their traditional attire. Only after serious violence was order restored and the offending policy rescinded, and Bentinck was recalled in 1807.

After service in the Peninsular War, including as a brigade commander at the Battle of Corunna, Bentinck was appointed commander of British troops in Sicily. He was brevetted to lieutenant-general on 3 March 1811. A Whig, Bentinck used this position to meddle in internal Sicilian affairs, effecting the withdrawal from government of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies in favour of his son, Francis I of the Two Sicilies, the reactionary Queen&#x27;s disgrace, and an attempt to devise a constitutional government for the troubled island, all of which ultimately ended in failure. In 1814, Bentinck landed with British and Sicilian troops at Genoa, and commenced to make liberal proclamations of a new order in Italy which embarrassed the British government (which intended to give much of Italy to Austria), and led, once again, to his recall in 1815.

===Bentinck in Sicily===
As conditions in Sicily began to deteriorate at the beginning of the 19th century, England began worrying about its interests in the Mediterranean. Internal dissensions in the Sicilian government, and an ever-increasing suspicion that Queen Maria Carolina was in correspondence with the French with the French Occupation of Sicily as its object, led to the appointment of Bentinck as British representative to the Court of Palermo in July 1811. At the beginning of his time at the head of Sicilian affairs, politicians in London opposed the Bourbon rule and appealed for Sicilian annexation. Bentinck was sympathetic to the cause and plight of the Sicilians and &quot;was quickly convinced of the need for Britain to intervene in Sicilian affairs, not so much for Britain&#x27;s sake as for the well-being of the Sicilians.&quot; He was also one of the first of the dreamers to see a vision of a unified Italy.

The English, however, were content to support the Bourbons if they were willing to give the Sicilians more governmental control and a greater respect of their rights. Bentinck saw this as the perfect opportunity to insert his ideas of a Sicilian constitution. Opposition to the establishment of a constitution continued to surface, Maria Carolina proving to be one of the toughest. Her relationship with Bentinck can be summed up in the nickname that she gave him: &quot;La bestia feroce&quot; (the ferocious beast). Bentinck, however, was determined to see the establishment of a Sicilian Constitution and shortly thereafter exiled Maria Carolina from Palermo. On 18 June 1812 the Parliament assembled in Palermo and, about a month later, on 20 July 1812 the constitution was accepted and written on the basis of 15 articles, on the drafts prepared by Prince Belmonte and other Sicilian noblemen. With the establishment of the constitution the Sicilians had now gained an autonomy they had never experienced before. The constitution set up the separation of the legislative and executive powers and abolished the feudalistic practices that had been established and recognised for the past 700 years.

Bentinck&#x27;s success in establishing a Sicilian constitution lasted only a few years. On 8 December 1816, a year after Ferdinand IV returned to the throne of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the constitution was abolished and Sicily was reunited with Naples. The constitutional experiment was deemed a failure although it cannot be said to be his alone. The Sicilian nobles were inexperienced and in the face of the difficulties of 1814 and 1815 could not sustain a constitution without British support, which was withdrawn in the wake of the end of the Napoleonic wars. The British no longer had an invested interest in the internal affairs of Sicily now that the threat of French invasion had been removed. The establishment of a Sicilian constitution that was facilitated by Bentinck was not to be soon forgotten. The ideas found therein and the small taste of freedom lingered in the memories of the Sicilians and had an influence on the desire for autonomy that was at the base of the Sicilian revolutions of 1820 and 1848.

===Italian adventure===

Sailing from Sicily on 30 January 1814, Bentinck first made for Naples. There he reluctantly signed an armistice with Joachim Murat; whom he personally detested as being a man whose &quot;whole life had been a crime,&quot; yet whom Britain found it expedient to detach from his brother-in-law, Napoleon, by guaranteeing his Kingdom of Naples in return for an alliance. Having instructed the forces under his command in Sicily to make a landing at Livorno, Bentinck then travelled north, with a day&#x27;s stop in Rome, to join them.
 The disembarkation at Livorno began on 9 March and took three days to complete, Murat&#x27;s Neapolitans already having occupied the port beforehand.

Napoleon&#x27;s sister Elisa, though having now abandoned her Grand Duchy of Tuscany, had nevertheless not given up completely in attempting to salvage something out of the collapse of her brother&#x27;s Empire. Having obtained from Murat - husband of her sister Caroline - the guarantee that he would obtain the consent of the Coalition he had just joined to her retention of the Principality of Lucca and Piombino in return for having rendered up Tuscany without a fight, she had, by the time of Bentinck&#x27;s appearance at Livorno, retired to Lucca. Upon hearing of his landing, she sent a delegation to gain assurances that Murat&#x27;s pact would be respected. Bentinck replied that it would not. If she did not depart immediately, he said, she would be arrested. With 2,000 British troops dispatched towards the city to carry out this threat, the heavily pregnant Elisa had no choice but to abandon the last of her territories and flee north, where she eventually fell into allied hands at Bologna.

Elisa quit Lucca on 13 March. The next day, Bentinck issued a proclamation from Livorno calling on the Italian nation to rise in a movement of liberation. &quot;&quot;Italians!&quot; he declared, &quot;Great Britain has landed her troops on your shores; she holds out her hand to you to free you from the iron yoke of Buonaparte...hesitate no longer...assert your rights and your liberty. Call us, and we will hasten to you, and then, our forces joined, will effect that Italy may become what in the best times she was&quot;&quot;. In thus attempting to bring about his long-nurtured dream of an independent Italian nation-state in the north and centre (he did not consider the Neapolitans and Sicilians &#x27;Italians&#x27;),
 Bentinck was quite publicly repudiating the policy of his own Government - which was intending to largely restore the status quo ante bellum in Italy; with Austria in possession of Lombardy and the King of Sardinia re-established in Piedmont. For the next month, Bentinck was therefore operating as effectively an independent actor representative of Britain only, as Rosselli says, in the widest sense: in that he held himself to be furthering Britain&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; interests, regardless of whether the current Government recognised them or not.

Ordering his troops north to besiege Genoa, Bentinck himself now headed to Reggio Emilia for a conference with Murat. At this conference on the 15th, he brazenly demanded that Tuscany be handed over to himself and evacuated by the Neapolitan forces then in possession of it. It was necessary, he argued, that Tuscany be under British jurisdiction, as otherwise he would have no logistical base from which to conduct future operations - to which Murat replied that it was the same argument on his side which dictated his own necessary possession of it. Suddenly threatening to turn his forces against Naples itself and restore the rightful Ferdinand IV if Murat did not give way, Bentinck was quickly reprimanded in a firm note from Castlereagh reminding him that he was instructed to co-operate in every way with Murat and Austria. At which he reluctantly withdrew his bid for Tuscany - which he had likely been hoping to turn into the nucleus of a free Italian state under his own aegis - and left for Genoa. There had, in any case, been no discernable response from the Tuscans to Bentinck&#x27;s proclamation, while in Genoa he would find a welcoming audience at last.

Bentinck had been ordered to take and occupy Genoa in the name of the King of Sardinia. But when the city surrendered to him on 18 April 1814, he instead proclaimed - contrary to the intentions of the Coalition - the restoration of the Republic of Genoa and the repeal of all laws passed since 1797, much to the enthusiasm of the Genoese. At the same time, he dispatched an expeditionary force to Corsica to attempt to revive the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom of 1794–1796 and gain for Britain another useful base in the Mediterranean. In Genoa meanwhile, on the 24th, he received representations from the provisional government in Milan beseeching Britain&#x27;s support for the maintenance of an independent Kingdom of Italy rather than the restoration of Austria&#x27;s rule over Lombardy. With Napoleon&#x27;s abdication of both the French and Italian thrones on 11 April, the government in Milan was in search of a new sovereign who would better bolster their chances of survival and, in seeking to bind Britain to their cause, the suggestion was put to Bentinck that Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, the seventh son of George III, would be a welcome candidate. Though Bentinck recommended they might look to Archduke Francis of Este as a more realistic candidate in order to mollify the Austrians.

With Napoleon&#x27;s double abdication on 11 April however - though the news took time to cross the Alps - Bentinck&#x27;s capacity to influence events on the ground while, with the war against the Emperor still raging, all was still to a great extent up in the air, largely came to an end. As did his Government&#x27;s motive for toleration. His erratic behaviour over the recent months had led the Prime Minister Lord Liverpool to brand him simply &quot;mad&quot;, and his scope of authority was sharply reduced; though he was not finally dismissed from his grand post as Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean until April the following year.

== Last Governor-General of Bengal==
Lord William Bentinck was the first governor general of British-occupied India. Everyone else before him was the Governor of Bengal (Fort William). On his return to England, Bentinck served in the House of Commons for some years before being appointed Governor-General of Bengal in 1828. His principal concern was to turn around the loss-making East India Company, to ensure that its charter would be renewed by the British government.
Bentinck engaged in an extensive range of cost-cutting measures, earning the lasting enmity of many military men whose wages were cut. Although historians emphasise his more efficient financial management, his modernising projects also included a policy of westernisation, influenced by the Utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and James Mill, which was more controversial. He also reformed the court system.

==Educational reforms==
Bentinck made English the medium of instruction after passing the English Education Act 1835. English replaced Persian as the language of the higher courts. He founded the Calcutta Medical college after the committee appointed by him found that &quot;The Native Medical Institution established in 1822 , The Committee headed by Dr John Grant as president and J C C Sutherland, C E Trevelyan, Thomas Spens, Ram Comul Sen and M J Bramley as members found the education, examination system, training and lack of practical anatomy clearly below standards&quot; and recommended its closure, which Bentinck accepted and he opened the Calcutta Medical college which offered western medical education and opening of this college is seen as Introduction of Western Science into India. It was the first western medical college in Asia and it was open to all without discrimination of caste or creed. James Ranald Martin compares the foundation of this college to Bentinck&#x27;s other acclaimed act of abolishing sati.

==Social reforms==
===Abolition of Sati===
Bentinck decided to put an immediate end to sati practice after careful enquiry within a year of his arrival in Calcutta. Horace Hayman Wilson and Raja Ram Mohan Roy cautioned Bentinck against abruptly ending the practice and suggested that the practice might be gradually stopped by increasing checks. After observing that the judges in the courts were unanimously in favor of the ban, Bentinck proceeded to lay the draft before his council. Charles Metcalfe, the Governor&#x27;s most prominent counselor, expressed apprehension that the banning of sati might be &quot;used by the disaffected and designing&quot; as &quot;an engine to produce insurrection.&quot; However these concerns did not deter him from upholding the Governor&#x27;s decision &quot;in the suppression of the horrible custom by which so many lives are cruelly sacrificed.&quot;

Thus on Sunday morning of 4 December 1829 Lord Bentinck issued Regulation XVII declaring sati to be illegal and punishable in criminal courts. It was presented to William Carey for translation. His response is recorded as follows: &quot;Springing to his feet and throwing off his black coat he cried, &#x27;No church for me to-day... If I delay an hour to translate and publish this, many a widow&#x27;s life may be sacrificed,&#x27; he said. By evening the task was finished.&quot;

On 2 February 1830 this law was extended to Madras and Bombay. The ban was challenged by a petition signed by &quot;several thousand persons, being zamindars, principal and other Hindoo inhabitants of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa etc.&quot; and the matter went to the Privy Council in London. Along with British supporters, Ram Mohan Roy presented counter-petitions to parliament in support of ending sati. The Privy Council rejected the petition in 1832, and the ban on sati was upheld.

===Ban on female infanticide and human sacrifice===
Bentinck prohibited female infanticide and the custom of certain of newly born girls to be killed and against human sacrifices.
Although his reforms met little resistance among native Indians at the time, Indian enemies repeated a story to the effect that he had once planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and sell off the marble. According to Bentinck&#x27;s biographer John Rosselli, the story arose from Bentinck&#x27;s fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort and of the metal from the Great Agra Gun, the largest cannon ever cast, a historical artefact which dated to the reign of Akbar the Great.
 Bentinck removed flogging as a punishment in the Indian Army.

==Saint Helena Act 1833==
The Saint Helena Act 1833, also called the Charter Act 1833, was passed during Bentinck&#x27;s tenure and, accordingly, the monopoly of the East India Company in China was abolished, whilst in India it was extended for further next 20 years. The Governor-General of Bengal became the Governor-General of India. This act added a law member to the executive council of the governor general. Bishops of Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta were to be appointed for the benefit of the Christians in India.

Bentinck returned to the UK in 1835 and refused a peerage, partly because he had no children and partly because he wanted to stand for Parliament again. He again entered the House of Commons as a Member for Glasgow.

==Personal life, death and legacy==

In August 1791, Bentinck played in a non-first-class cricket match for Marylebone Cricket Club against Nottingham Cricket Club at King&#x27;s Meadow, Nottingham.

Bentinck married Lady Mary, daughter of Arthur Acheson, 1st Earl of Gosford, on 18 February 1803. The marriage was childless. She was a watercolourist, and her album of 61 paintings of the birds of the Himalaya Mountains, circa 1833, is held at the Natural History Museum, London. He died in Paris on 17 June 1839, aged 64. Mary died in May 1843. They are buried together in the Bentinck family vault in St Marylebone Parish Church, London.

Explorer Matthew Flinders, who in 1802 charted the South Wellesley Islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia (now part of the state of Queensland), assigned the name Bentinck Island in honour of Lord Bentinck, and the island group (Wellesley) and the largest island (Mornington Island) in honour of Richard Wellesley, 2nd Earl of Mornington. In 1803, the two men had acted as interceded on Flinders&#x27; behalf to persuade the French to release Flinders after he had been imprisoned by them on Mauritius.

<text>Attila Hörbiger (21 April 1896 – 27 April 1987) was an Austrian stage and movie actor.

==Life==

Hörbiger was born in the Hungarian capital Budapest, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the son of engineer Hanns Hörbiger and the younger brother of actor Paul Hörbiger. In 1903 his family moved to Vienna, where his father set up a design office. Attila attended the Benedictine gymnasium at Saint Paul&#x27;s Abbey, Carinthia from 1906 to 1914.

He began his stage career at the Wiener Neustadt municipal theatre in 1919, followed by engagements in Stuttgart and Bozen. In 1921 he performed at the Raimund Theater in Vienna and at the Lehartheater in Bad Ischl; his next engagements were at the municipal theatre in Reichenberg (Liberec), at the Vienna stage of Josef Jarno, at the German Reduta Theatre in Brünn (Brno), and at the New German Theatre in Prague. In 1928, Hörbiger joined the Theater in der Josefstadt ensemble under director Max Reinhardt; and from 1950 to 1975, he was a member of the Burgtheater. He acted Rudolf von Habsburg in Grillparzer&#x27;s &quot;König Ottokars Glück und Ende&quot; at the great reopening of the Burgtheater on 15 October 1955.

From 1935 to 1937, and again from 1947 to 1951, he took the title role in the summer performances of Hofmannsthal&#x27;s play &quot;Jedermann&quot; (&quot;Everyman&quot;) at the Salzburg Festival – according to Max Reinhardt the best actor ever in this role.

Hörbiger started his film career in the late 1920s. In 1931, he starred in &quot;Die große Liebe&quot;, the first film ever directed by Otto Preminger. He played in several German and Austrian movies, often alongside his second wife, Paula Wessely, whom he had married in 1935. With her, he had three actress daughters, (b. 1936), Christiane Hörbiger (b. 1938), and Maresa Hörbiger (b. 1945). After the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; to Nazi Germany, Hörbiger joined the NSDAP. He and Paula Wessely starred in the anti-Polish propaganda film &quot;Heimkehr&quot; (&quot;Homecoming&quot;) of 1941, directed by Gustav Ucicky.

Still in 1974, Hörbiger premiered as &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot; at the Burgtheater; he appeared in theatre performances until 1985. Two years later he died in Vienna at the age of 91 following a stroke. He is buried at the Grinzing cemetery.

<text>Coral snakes are a large group of elapid snakes that can be divided into two distinct groups, the Old World coral snakes and New World coral snakes. There are 27 species of Old World coral snakes, in three genera (&quot;Calliophis&quot;, &quot;Hemibungarus&quot;, and &quot;Sinomicrurus&quot;), and 83 recognized species of New World coral snakes, in two genera (&quot;Micruroides&quot; and &quot;Micrurus&quot;). Genetic studies have found that the most basal lineages have origins in Asia, suggesting that the group originated in the Old World. While new world species of both genera are venomous, their bites are seldom lethal; only two confirmed fatalities have been documented in the past 100 years from the genus &quot;Micrurus&quot;. Meanwhile, snakes of the genus &quot;Micruroides&quot; have never caused a medically significant bite.

==North American coloration patterns==
Experts now recognize that certain coloration patterns and common mnemonics—such as the phrase “Red against yellow, deadly fellow; red against black, friendly Jack,” which people sometimes use to distinguish between the venomous coral snake and the non-venomous milksnake—are not consistent enough to be trustworthy. While any snake exhibiting the coral snake&#x27;s color and/or banding pattern in the southeastern United States will almost certainly, in fact, be a coral snake, there are coral snakes in other parts of the world that are colored differently.

Coral snakes in the United States are most notable for their red, yellow/white, and black-colored banding. However, several nonvenomous species in the U.S. have similar (though not identical) bandings, including the two scarlet snake species in the genus &quot;Cemophora&quot;, and some of the kingsnakes (including the aforementioned milksnakes) in the genus &quot;Lampropeltis&quot;. However, in reference to the mnemonic phrase “red touching yellow, a deadly fellow,” some of these kingsnakes do not naturally display any red touching yellow, to begin with. Additionally, some ground snakes in the genus &quot;Sonora&quot; (of the southwestern U.S.) can have a color pattern that matches that of the sympatric Sonoran coral snake (&quot;Micruroides euryxanthus&quot;). No genuine coral snake in the U.S. exhibits red bands of color, in contact with bands of black, except in rare cases of an aberrant pattern. Thus, while on extremely rare occasions when a certain non-venomous snake might be mistaken for a coral snake, the mnemonic holds true. However, a red–yellow–black banded snake in the U.S. (whose red and black banding actually touch) is rarely a venomous coral snake. 

Furthermore, the mnemonic is not consistently accurate for North American coral snake species found south of the U.S., either. Some species, like Mexico’s Oaxacan coral snake (&quot;Micrurus ephippifer&quot;) or Clark&#x27;s coral snake (&quot;Micrurus clarki&quot;, of Costa Rica &amp; Panama), do actually fit the mnemonic; others, like the Honduran Roatan coral snake (&quot;Micrurus ruatanus&quot;), or the redtail coral snake (&quot;Micrurus mipartitus&quot;) of Panama, do not. Further still, some South American coral snakes will fit the mnemonic, while others do not. To complicate the issue more, the South American tricolored hognose snake (&quot;Xenodon pulcher&quot;) has repeated bands of red-black-white-black, imitating the coral snake as a defense mechanism, with the key visual difference being their upturned snout (used for burrowing). The hognoses are, actually, mildly rear-fanged venomous; although generally not considered serious to humans, anecdotal research has suggested the South American hognoses to possess slightly more potent venom than the North American hognoses. In the Old World, none of the coral snake species usually fit the mnemonic.

Most species of coral snake are small in size. North American species average around in length, but specimens of up to or slightly larger have been reported. Some coral snakes even live in the water but most of them do not. Aquatic species have flattened tails that act as fins, aiding in swimming.

==Behavior==

Coral snakes vary widely in their behavior, but most are very elusive, fossorial (burrowing) snakes which spend most of their time buried beneath the ground or in the leaf litter of a rainforest floor, coming to the surface only when it rains or during breeding season. Some species, like &quot;Micrurus surinamensis&quot;, are almost entirely aquatic and spend most of their lives in slow-moving bodies of water that have dense vegetation.

Coral snakes feed mostly on smaller snakes, lizards, frogs, nestling birds, small rodents, etc.

Like all elapid snakes, coral snakes possess a pair of small hollow fangs to deliver their venom. The fangs are positioned at the front of the mouth. The fangs are fixed in position rather than retractable, and rather than being directly connected to the venom duct, they have a small groove through which the venom enters the base of the fangs. Because the fangs are relatively small and inefficient for venom delivery, rather than biting quickly and letting go (like vipers), coral snakes tend to hold onto their prey and make chewing motions when biting. The venom takes time to reach full effect.

Coral snakes are not aggressive or prone to biting and account for less than one percent of the total number of snake bites each year in the United States. The life span of coral snakes in captivity is about seven years.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;M. fulvius&quot; reproduction is internal fertilization through the use of hemipenes. The breeding season occurs from spring to early summer and late summer to early fall. Male combat is not typical in &quot;M. fulvius&quot; as males are smaller than females. &quot;Micrurus fulvius&quot; are oviparous and typically lay eggs from May to July. During early spring females will undergo sudden vitellogenesis–oocyte and yolk formation–in preparation for breeding. Approximately 37 days post fertilization oviposition occurs and the average clutch size ranges from five to seven eggs. However, some in captivity have laid as many as thirteen eggs. The incubation period of the &quot;M. fulvius&quot; eggs normally reaches 60 days. Males also undergo sexual changes throughout the year, testicular recrudescence start in the fall and testicular regression occurs come spring. However, males typically have mature sperm residing in the epididymis year round and are capable of storing sperm in the deferent duct over the winter till the females are receptive. A study investigating how climate influences the reproductive cycle discovered species found closer to the equator displayed more continuous cycles while those in colder regions had more seasonal cycles. With increasing temperatures as a result of climate change, continuous cycles have the possibility of becoming more prevalent. Offspring reach maturation depending on sex, males mature at roughly 11 to 16 months while females reach maturity later at 26 months.

==Distribution (U.S.) ==
New World coral snakes exist in the southern range of many temperate U.S. states. Coral snakes are found in scattered localities in the southern coastal plains from North Carolina to Louisiana, including all of Florida. They can be found in pine and scrub oak sandhill habitats in parts of this range, but sometimes inhabit hardwood areas and pine flatwoods that undergo seasonal flooding.

There is controversy about the classification of the very similar Texas coral snake as a separate species. Its habitat, in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas is separated from the eastern coral snake&#x27;s habitat by the Mississippi River. The coral snake population is most dense in the southeastern United States.

The Arizona coral snake is classified as a separate species and genus and is found in central and southern Arizona, extreme southwestern New Mexico and southward to Sinaloa in western Mexico. It occupies arid and semiarid regions in many different habitat types, including thornscrub, desert-scrub, woodland, grassland and farmland. It is found in the plains and lower mountain slopes, at elevations ranging from sea level to ; often found in rocky areas.

==Danger to humans==
New World coral snakes possess one of the most potent venoms of any North American snake. However, relatively few bites are recorded due to their reclusive nature and the fact they generally inhabit sparsely populated areas. Even in areas that are densely populated, bites are rare. According to the American National Institutes of Health, there are an average of 15–25 coral snake bites in the United States each year. 
When confronted by humans, coral snakes will almost always attempt to flee, and bite only if restrained. In addition, coral snakes have short fangs (proteroglyph dentition) that cannot penetrate thick clothing although bites are possible through normal thin clothing. Any skin penetration, however, is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. 

Historically, the venom of the North American &quot;Micrurus&quot; and &quot;Micruroides&quot; species was believed to contain powerful neurotoxins which could paralyze the breathing muscles, requiring mechanical or artificial respiration. It was usually reported that there was only mild pain associated with a bite and that respiratory failure could occur and onset of clinical symptoms may be delayed for as much as 10 to 18 hours. Coral Snake venom contains a neurotoxic component and symptoms include pain from the bite, sialorrhea, paresthesia, ptosis, weakness, blurred vision, paralysis, fasciculation and diplopia. However recent studies on the bites of the Texas coral snake (&quot;Micrurus tener)&quot; have shown that these bites rarely require antivenom, don&#x27;t usually show any systemic respiratory problems and can be intensely painful. Further studies are necessary to see if these clinical features are true of all &quot;Micrurus&quot; species. Body length in coral snakes appears to be positively associated with venom yield.

Shortages of coral snake antivenom were previously reported, but one source states that production has resumed and, Pfizer indicates that antivenom is available.

==Mimicry==
New World coral snakes serve as models for their Batesian mimics, false coral snakes, snake species whose venom is less toxic, as well as for many nonvenomous snake species that bear superficial resemblances to them. The role of coral snakes as models for Batesian mimics is supported by research showing that coral snake color patterns deter predators from attacking snake-shaped prey, and that in the absence of coral snakes, species hypothesized to mimic them are indeed attacked more frequently. Species that appear similar to coral snakes include:
*&quot;Cemophora coccinea&quot;
*&quot;Chionactis palarostris&quot;
*&quot;Erythrolamprus aesculapii&quot;
*&quot;Erythrolamprus bizona&quot;
*&quot;Erythrolamprus ocellatus&quot;, Tobago false coral snake
*&quot;Lampropeltis elapsoides&quot;, scarlet kingsnake 
*&quot;Lampropeltis pyromelana&quot;
*&quot;Lampropeltis triangulum&quot;, milk snake, including the following subspecies and others:
**&quot;Lampropeltis triangulum amaura&quot;
**&quot;Lampropeltis triangulum annulata&quot;
**&quot;Lampropeltis triangulum campbelli&quot;
**&quot;Lampropeltis triangulum gaigeae&quot;

<text>Rottweil (; Alemannic: &quot;Rautweil&quot;) is a town in southwest Germany in the state of Baden-Württemberg. Rottweil was a free imperial city for nearly 600 years.

Located between the Black Forest and the Swabian Alps, Rottweil has over 25,000 inhabitants as of 2022. The town is famous for its medieval center and for its traditional carnival (called &quot;Fasnet&quot; in the local Swabian dialect). It is the oldest town in Baden-Württemberg, and its appearance has changed very little since the 16th century.

The town gives its name to the Rottweiler dog breed.

== History ==

Rottweil was founded by the Romans in AD 73 as Arae Flaviae and became a &quot;municipium&quot;, but there are traces of human settlement going back to 2000 BC. Roman baths and an Orpheus mosaic of c. AD 180 date from the time of Roman settlement. The present town became a ducal and a royal court before 771 and in 1268 it became a free imperial city.

In 1463 Rottweil joined the Swiss Confederacy under the pretence of a temporary alliance. In 1476 the Rottweilers fought on the Swiss side against Charles the Bold in the Battle of Morat. In 1512, Pope Julius II gave the city a valuable &quot;Julius banner&quot; for its services in the 1508–1510 &quot;Great Pavier Campaign&quot; to expel the French. In 1519, the Rottweilers left the old Swiss alliance. They joined a new one in which their membership was extended indefinitely – the so-called &quot;Eternal Covenant&quot;.

Rottweil thus became a centre of the Swiss Confederation. The relations between the Swiss Confederation and Rottweil cooled rapidly during the Protestant Reformation. When Rottweil was troubled by wars, however, it still asked the Confederates for help.

In the Rottweil Witch Hunts from 1546 to 1661, 266 so-called witches, wizards and magicians were executed in the imperial city of Rottweil. On April 15, 2015, they were given a posthumous pardon. An official apology was given by the City Council about 400 years after their violent deaths.

Rottweil lost both its status as free city and its alliance with the Swiss Confederacy with the conquest of the region by Napoleon in 1803.

==1990s==
Major shake-ups occur in the who&#x27;s-who of US game publishing and distribution. Wizards of the Coast, which started the decade as a small West Coast publisher, buys veteran Avalon Hill later in the decade, only to be bought up in turn by industry juggernaut Hasbro. TSR and Iron Crown Enterprises both collapse.

The collectible card game (CCG) became a dominant business model, first by &quot;&quot; then by several rivals. By the mid-nineties, hundreds of CCGs competed for market share, and most of these products were culled for weak sales. Collectible gaming also expanded from cards into dice, tiles, and miniatures.

&quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot; breaks Eurogaming into the American market, becoming an overnight bestseller and gateway game. Publishers such as Mayfair Games and Rio Grande Games begin meeting the new market demand with titles from Europe.

==2000s==
The internet continues to shake up the publishing and distribution of games. Online retailing becomes a serious threat to &quot;brick and mortar&quot; retailers. Desktop publishing proves to be a boon for hobby game designers, and the door is opened for many small publishers producing their own game designs. Z-Man Games and Fantasy Flight Games become major players in the US hobby game industry. Miniatures games dominate the collectible games market.

<text>Toney&#x27;s Brook is a tributary of the Second River in Essex County, New Jersey in the United States.

Generally thought to be named for Anthony Oliff, a resident of West Orange (Newark in his time), Toney&#x27;s Brook originates in Montclair northwest of the Upper Montclair railway station (originally north of the Montclair Presby Iris Garden), now with two branches, east and west of the elevated railroad tracks at Bellevue. In Montclair it is joined by two tributary streams, both originally also called Toney&#x27;s (one called Tunnel Brook, arising from the cliff near Claremont Ave.). In Montclair, Toney&#x27;s Brook runs through Anderson Park, Edgemont Memorial Park, Montclair High School and Glenfield Park. In Glenfield Park, the brook continues southeast into Glen Ridge, where it flows through &quot;The Glen&quot; (the glen for which that borough is named). It then flows into Bloomfield and, in Watsessing Park, joins the Second River, a tributary of the Passaic River. Many roads have been built over the brook and in some places it is covered up completely, canalized or culvertised.

In the 19th and early 20th century, Toney&#x27;s Brook supported several mills, which produced lumber, beer, calico, brass fittings, and pasteboard boxes.

<text>Manfredo Tafuri (Rome, 4 November 1935 – Venice, 23 February 1994) was an Italian Marxist architect, historian, theoretician, critic and academic. He was described by one commentator as the world&#x27;s most important architectural historian of the second half of the 20th century. He is noted for his pointed critiques of the partisan &quot;operative criticism&quot; of previous architectural historians and critics like Bruno Zevi and Siegfried Giedion and for challenging the idea that the Renaissance was a &quot;golden age&quot; as it had been characterised in the work of earlier authorities like Heinrich Wölfflin and Rudolf Wittkower.

==Career==
For Tafuri, architectural history does not follow a teleological scheme in which one language succeeds another in linear sequence. Instead, it is a continuous struggle played out on critical, theoretical and ideological levels as well as through the multiple constraints placed on practice. Since this struggle continues in the present, architectural history is not a dead academic subject, but an open arena for debate. In his view, like other cultural domains, but even more so, due to the tension between its autonomous, artistic character and its technical and functional dimensions, architecture is a field defined and constituted by crisis. Though Tafuri was caught up in the debates of his era, he inserted the task of the architectural historian into a framework combining critical participation and historical distance.

Tafuri explored every era of architectural history in the West from the medieval period to the present and made an important contribution to the study of Japanese modern architecture. In the last decade of his career he undertook a comprehensive reassessment of the theory and practice of Renaissance architecture, exploring its various social, intellectual and cultural contexts, while providing a broad understanding of uses of representation that shaped the entire era. His final work, &quot;Interpreting the Renaissance: Princes, Cities, Architects&quot;, published in 1992, synthesizes the history of architectural ideas and projects through discussions of the great centres of architectural innovation in Italy (Florence, Rome, and Venice), key patrons from the middle of the fifteenth century to the early sixteenth century, and crucial figures such as Leon Battista Alberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Francesco di Giorgio, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Bramante, Raphael, Baldassare Castiglione and Giulio Romano.

Tafuri held the position of chair of architectural history at the University Iuav of Venice. He was a member of the Communist Party.

<text>Ahmet Taner Kışlalı (10 July 1939 – 21 October 1999) was a Turkish professor, politician, and commentator. He served in the Parliament of Turkey in 1977 and was minister of culture in 1978 and 1979. 

==Biography==
Kışlalı completed his primary and secondary education in Kilis, and graduated from &quot;Kabataş Erkek Lisesi&quot; high school in Istanbul in 1957.

Kışlalı received a degree from the School of Political Sciences at Ankara University, in 1963, where he was the assistant editor of College newspaper &quot;Yeni Gün&quot;. He got his PhD on &quot;Çağdaş Türkiye&#x27;de Siyasal Güçler&quot; (&quot;Political Powers in Contemporary Turkey&quot;) from the University of Paris, Department of Constitutional Law and Political Science. He worked as a lecturer in Hacettepe University from 1968 until 1972, then working as an assistant professor at Ankara University, and later an associate professor in 1977.

Politically, he was a Kemalist who adopted the views of democratic socialism and social democracy. In 1977 he was elected to the Turkish parliament, Grand National Assembly of Turkey, as deputy of İzmir. Between the years 1978 and 1979, he was appointed to position of ministry of culture, by prime minister Bülent Ecevit. During his term of ministry, he restarted the effort of printing classical works by the state press, making these available to masses at reasonable prices.

After the military coup of 12 September 1980, Ahmet Taner Kışlalı went back to the academia, and became a full professor in 1988. He continued to give lectures on political science in Department of Communication at Ankara University, after his retirement. Starting from 1991, he had a regular column in the leftist newspaper &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot; with the title &quot;Haftaya Bakış&quot; (&quot;A View of the Week&quot;).

==Assassination==
On 21 October 1999, shortly after having faxed his article to &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot; at 9:40 h local time, Ahmet Taner Kışlalı left his home and headed for his car. As he got in the car, he noticed a package placed at the windshield wiper. He picked it up with his left arm, and at that moment an explosion occurred tearing off his left arm at elbow. His wristwatch penetrated into his head together with bomb shrapnel.

After memorial services held at the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Faculty of Communications in Ankara University, Grand Theatre of Ankara Opera House, Ankara Office of &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot; newspaper, and religious funeral service at Kocatepe Mosque, he was laid to rest at Karşıyaka Cemetery in Ankara.

<doc id="611525" wikidata="Q2138565" url="?curid=611525" title="Nicolae Crețulescu">
<text>Prince Nicolae Crețulescu (, surname also spelled Kretzulescu; 1 March 1812 – 26 June 1900) was a Prince Wallachian, later Romanian politician and physician. He is an aristocrat and member of the Kretzulescu family. He served two terms as Prime Minister of Romania: from 1862 to 1863, and from 1865 to 1866. He was elected to the Romanian Academy. He was the 3rd president of the Romanian Academy from 1872 to 1873.

Born in Bucharest, he studied medicine in Paris, having Gustave Flaubert as a colleague. As a physician, his notable work was the translation of Jean Cruveilhier&#x27;s manual of anatomy.

A member of the Liberal faction, Crețulescu first became prime minister after the assassination of Barbu Catargiu, under ruler Alexandru Ioan Cuza. He avoided debating the issue of land reform, at that time the most contentious subject in Romanian politics; instead, Crețulescu focused on unifying the public health system, creating the Directorate General of the Public Archive, and establishing a Council for Public Instruction. Additionally, he laid the groundwork for further laws secularizing the property of monasteries.

In 1995 she was a member of the jury at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival. Hörbiger&#x27;s only foray into voice acting was the role of Mrs Calloway (the dairy cow) in the German-language version of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Home on the Range&quot;.

<text>The Joslyn Art Museum, commonly referred to as the Joslyn, is a fine arts museum in Omaha, Nebraska, the largest in the state. It opened in 1931 at the initiative of Sarah H. Joslyn, in memory of her husband, businessman George A. Joslyn. Since its opening, the museum has gone through several expansions, the last of which was completed in 2024. It is the only museum in Nebraska with a comprehensive permanent collection, comprising over 12,000 objects, including nineteenth and twentieth-century collections of American and European art, Western American Art, Chinese and Japanese art, as well as contemporary art. The Joslyn is home to the Margre H. Durham Center for Western Studies, established in 1980, which stewards two of the most important collections of works by Western artists Karl Bodmer and Alfred Jacob Miller in the country.

==History==
===George and Sarah Joslyn===
Originally from Vermont, George and Sarah Joslyn moved to Des Moines, Iowa in 1879 for George&#x27;s new printing job at the Iowa Printing Company, which involved manual labor. In 1880, they went to Omaha, where George was to manage his own printing branch of the company. He then founded his own company, called the Western Newspaper Union, which soon became the largest supplier of &quot;ready print&quot; newspapers and provided news for 12,000 people within the United States. This is the period during which he gained most of his wealth. George was known as a philanthropist, but he was also considered a hard man of business in the Omaha community, and also considered an entrepreneurer.

As a couple, George and Sarah Joslyn were known to be great lovers of the arts, especially music. When George died in 1916 (as the richest man in Nebraska), Sarah decided she wanted a memorial building dedicated to his life and accomplishments, which would reflect their love for the arts. It would also serve as a gift to the people of Omaha and a way for the Joslyns to give back to the city that had given them so much. Sarah Joslyn founded and funded the nonprofit Society of Liberal Arts to find a permanent home for art collections in Omaha. When the Society of Liberal Arts was created, her intended purpose for it was to create and operate the Joslyn Memorial building; it would officially become the Joslyn Art Museum in 1987.

In 1940, Sarah Joslyn passed away and gave control of the Society of Liberal Arts to the trustees. The endowment she left to help maintain the museum was then also used to acquire new art and expand the museum&#x27;s collection.

===Building History===
Kiewit started construction on the Joslyn Memorial building in 1928, but plans for the building started to come together much earlier, in 1920. Since the Joslyns were particularly fond of music, the building was initially designed as a concert hall. Art galleries were added at the suggestion of various arts groups throughout Omaha.

The Memorial occupies a large and impressive art deco building designed by John McDonald (architect) and Alan McDonald (architect). John McDonald was a close friend to the Joslyns; before designing the Memorial, he designed their Scottish castle-like home, commonly known as the Joslyn Castle, along with several other public and residential buildings throughout Omaha. The impressive art deco facade of the building drew inspiration from Egyptian temples, art moderne motifs, and the Nebraska capitol building in Lincoln. The Memorial building is constructed of Georgia pink marble, with 38 different marbles from all over the world and stone from across Europe and Africa in the interior.

The decorative panels on the exterior were designed by sculptor John David Brcin, and refer to the peoples of the plains—both the original Native American inhabitants and the later European explorers and settlers. There are eight decorative panels in total around the outside of the building: Dissemination of Intelligence (front right), The Pioneer Press (front left), The Homesteaders (north), Civic Builders (south), Indian Signal Fire (north), Indian Prayer for Life (south), Indian Picture Writing (back north), and Indian Sign Language (back south). The inscriptions carved on the building were written by Hartley Burr Alexander. Sarah gave $2.6 million for the construction of the Memorial building, and an endowment for its continued maintenance.

The Joslyn Memorial building opened in 1931 and consisted of various art galleries, a concert hall, a lecture hall, an art library, classrooms, and an atrium with a fountain. In 1938, the Memorial was listed as one of the one hundred finest buildings in the United States. Several decades after the Memorial building opened to the public, it was running out of space for staff and the growing collection. Eugene Kingman, the director of the Joslyn during the 1960s, wanted the Joslyn to be the &quot;Smithsonian of Omaha,&quot; a place where science and the arts could come together. With this idea in mind, he wanted to expand the Memorial and construct additional buildings, which would include a science museum and a planetarium. Lack of funds for the project and Kingman&#x27;s departure in 1969 put an end to this plan. However, Kingman saved quite a bit of historical material as part of his vision for the Memorial, which was later donated to historical museums around Omaha. After his departure, the Joslyn Memorial returned to a strong focus on the arts.

Even though there was still no expansion of the memorial building, in 1987 the Joslyn Memorial participated in a land exchange with Omaha Central High School. Through this exchange the Joslyn acquired land to the east of the memorial building to add a sculpture garden and expand parking, while the high school gained land to the northeast where a new football stadium was constructed.In 1994, the first addition to the Joslyn Art Museum was finally built. Designed by Lord Norman Foster, and included the Scott Pavilion. HDR Inc. and the Kiewit construction company worked together to build this addition. The exterior of the 1994 addition used pink Georgian marble from the same quarry as the original Memorial building, to make the addition look like a part of the original structure. A development campaign for the Joslyn Museum and the Western Heritage Museum (Durham Museum) ensured that there was plenty of money to construct this long-awaited addition to the museum. The $15.95 million budget included modern art acquisitions, visiting show galleries, a cafe, a kitchen, offices, storage space, a security control center, classroom space, and a beautiful glass atrium that connects the new addition to the Memorial building. Aside from the 1994 addition, sections of the memorial building were updated as part of the project, such as the restrooms, concert hall, and lecture hall.

In 2008, construction began on the Joslyn Museum Sculpture Gardens, which would better utilize the space received in the 1987 land exchange. The gardens opened in the summer of 2009, featuring work from local and national artists as well as a reflecting pool and waterfall. Shortly after its opening, the garden hosted the 24th annual &quot;Jazz on the Green&quot; festival; it continued to host that event until 2010, when Omaha Performing Arts began producing it. It was then moved it to the Midtown Crossing at Turner Park.

Announced in 2018, the most recent addition to the Joslyn Art Museum, the Rhonda and Howard Hawks Pavilion, has added 42,000 sq. ft. of space to the museum. The museum closed for construction of the new addition in May 2022 and reopened in September 2024. The architecture firm Snøhetta and local architecture company Alley Poyner Macchietto Architecture worked together to design the new addition. This new space includes galleries, classrooms, a new gift shop, and multi-purpose community rooms. As with the original Memorial building and the 1994 addition, Kiewit Building Group served as the contractor for the project. Along with the new building space, the gardens and outdoor spaces surrounding the museum were revamped. The exterior of the Rhonda and Howard Hawks Pavilion resembles a cloud, reflecting the original theme of the Great Plains. The addition also created a new entrance to the museum, allowing visitors to access the rest of the museum through the Pavilion.

==Admissions==
At its opening in 1931, the Memorial was to be an admission-free facility. Free admission continued until 1965, when an entry fee of 25 cents per person was instituted. As time went on the price of admission continued to rise; in 1987, it was two dollars for adults, while children and seniors paid one dollar. In 2010, admission went up to eight dollars per adult. In 2013, however, the museum moved back to its original vision of free admission. This change was made possible through a three-year grant from the Sherwood Foundation Grant; the Foundation believed that the Joslyn would be able to make up the funds from paid admissions in other ways once the grant concluded, as admission fees only represented 2–4% of the museum&#x27;s overall revenue. As of the museum&#x27;s reopening in 2024, admission remained free.

==Collections==
When the Joslyn Memorial first opened, there was a need for art to fill the galleries. The Art Institute of Omaha and the Friends of Art donated paintings. Nettie Fowler Dietz, wife of a local business owner, donated her personal collection in 1934, and Jessie Barton Christiancy bequested her collection and that of her late father, the industrialist Guy Conger Barton, to the museum. These were some of the first groups and people to donate collections to the Joslyn. After Sarah&#x27;s death, Paul Grummann, who was the director from 1931–1947, and Harold Parsons purchased European art for the Memorial. When Eugene Kingman took over as director in 1947, he expanded the Greek vase collection as well as art and artifacts from Indigenous cultures. In 1986 the Karl Bodmer collection, initially on loan to the museum, was donated and became part of the permanent collection. In recent years, the Joslyn has continued to expand its collections, particularly the contemporary and modern, with the acquisition of the collection of Omaha manufacturer Phillip G. Schrager, housed in the Hawks Pavilion.

<doc id="611537" wikidata="Q425450" url="?curid=611537" title="Magnesite">
<text>Magnesite is a mineral with the chemical formula (magnesium carbonate). Iron, manganese, cobalt, and nickel may occur as admixtures, but only in small amounts.

== Occurrence ==
Magnesite occurs as veins in and an alteration product of ultramafic rocks, serpentinite and other magnesium rich rock types in both contact and regional metamorphic terrains. These magnesites are often cryptocrystalline and contain silica in the form of opal or chert.

Magnesite is also present within the regolith above ultramafic rocks as a secondary carbonate within soil and subsoil, where it is deposited as a consequence of dissolution of magnesium-bearing minerals by carbon dioxide in groundwaters.

== Formation ==
Magnesite can be formed via talc carbonate metasomatism of peridotite and other ultramafic rocks. Magnesite is formed via carbonation of olivine in the presence of water and carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures and high pressures typical of the greenschist facies.

Magnesite can also be formed via the carbonation of magnesium serpentine (lizardite) via the following reaction:
:2 Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 + 3 CO2 → Mg3Si4O10(OH)2 + 3 MgCO3 + 3 H2O

However, when performing this reaction in the laboratory, the trihydrated form of magnesium carbonate (nesquehonite) will form at room temperature. This very observation led to the postulation of a &quot;dehydration barrier&quot; being involved in the low-temperature formation of anhydrous magnesium carbonate. Laboratory experiments with formamide, a liquid resembling water, have shown how no such dehydration barrier can be involved. The fundamental difficulty to nucleate anhydrous magnesium carbonate remains when using this non-aqueous solution. Not cation dehydration, but rather the spatial configuration of carbonate anions creates the barrier in the low-temperature nucleation of magnesite.

Magnesite has been found in modern sediments, caves and soils. Its low-temperature (around ) formation is known to require alternations between precipitation and dissolution intervals. The low-temperature formation of magnesite might well be of significance toward large-scale carbon sequestration. A major step forward toward the industrial production of magnesite at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of 316 K was described by Vandeginste. In those experiments small additions of hydrochloric acid alternated periodically with additions of sodium carbonate solution. New was also the very short duration of only a few hours for the alternating dissolution and precipitation cycles.

Magnesite was detected in meteorite ALH84001 and on planet Mars itself. Magnesite was identified on Mars using infrared spectroscopy from satellite orbit. Near Jezero Crater, Mg-carbonates have been detected and reported to have formed in lacustrine environment prevailing there. Controversy still exists over the temperature of formation of these carbonates. Low-temperature formation has been suggested for the magnesite from the Mars-derived ALH84001 meteorite.

Magnesium-rich olivine (forsterite) favors production of magnesite from peridotite. Iron-rich olivine (fayalite) favors production of magnetite-magnesite-silica compositions.

Magnesite can also be formed by way of metasomatism in skarn deposits, in dolomitic limestones, associated with wollastonite, periclase, and talc.

Resistant to high temperature and able to withstand high pressure, magnesite has been proposed to be one of the major carbonate bearing phase in Earth&#x27;s mantle and possible carriers for deep carbon reservoirs. For similar reason, it is found in metamorphosed peridotite rocks in Central Alps, Switzerland and high pressure eclogitic rocks from Tianshan, China.

Magnesite can also precipitate in lakes in presence of bacteria either as hydrous Mg-carbonates or magnesite.

== Uses ==

=== Refractory material ===
Similar to the production of lime, magnesite can be burned in the presence of charcoal to produce MgO, which, in the form of a mineral, is known as periclase. Large quantities of magnesite are burnt to make magnesium oxide: an important refractory (heat-resistant) material used as a lining in blast furnaces, kilns and incinerators.

Calcination temperatures determine the reactivity of resulting oxide products and the classifications of light burnt and dead burnt refer to the surface area and resulting reactivity of the product (this is typically determined by an industry metric of the iodine number).

&#x27;Light burnt&#x27; product generally refers to calcination commencing at 450 °C and proceeding to an upper limit of 900 °C – which results in good surface area and reactivity.

Above 900 °C, the material loses its reactive crystalline structure and reverts to the chemically inert &#x27;dead-burnt&#x27; product- which is preferred for use in refractory materials such as furnace linings.

In fire assay, magnesite cupels can be used for cupellation, as the magnesite cupel will resist the high temperatures involved.

=== Other uses ===
Magnesite can also be used as a binder in flooring material (magnesite screed). Furthermore, it is being used as a catalyst and filler in the production of synthetic rubber and in the preparation of magnesium chemicals and fertilizers.

Research is proceeding to evaluate the practicality of sequestering the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in magnesite on a large scale. This has focused on peridotites from ophiolites (obducted mantle rocks on crust) where magnesite can be created by letting carbon dioxide react with these rocks. Some progress has been made in ophiolites from Oman. But the major problem is that these artificial processes require sufficient porosity-permeability so that the fluids can flow but this is hardly the case in peridotites.

=== Artworks ===
Magnesite can be cut, drilled, and polished to form beads that are used in jewelry-making. Magnesite beads can be dyed into a broad spectrum of bold colors, including a light blue color that mimics the appearance of turquoise.

The Japanese-American artist Isamu Noguchi used magnesite as a sculptural material for some of his artworks.

== Isotopic structure ==
The recent advancement in the field of stable isotope geochemistry is the study of isotopic structure of minerals and molecules. This requires study of molecules with high resolutions looking at bonding scenario (how heavy isotopes are bonded to each other)- leading to knowledge of stability of molecule depending on its isotopic structure. 

Isotopically substituted molecules have higher mass. As a consequence, molecular vibration reduces and the molecule develops a lower zero point energy (see Kinetic isotope effect).

The abundances of certain bonds in certain molecules are sensitive to temperature at which it formed (e.g., abundance of 13C16O18O in carbonates as 13C-18O bond). This information has been exploited to form the foundation of clumped isotope geochemistry. Clumped isotope thermometers have been established for carbonate minerals like dolomite, calcite, siderite etc and non-carbonate compounds like methane and oxygen. Depending on the strength of cation-carbonate oxygen (ie, Mg-O, Ca-O) bonds- different carbonate minerals can form or preserve clumped isotopic signatures differently.

=== Measurements and reporting ===
Clumped isotopic analysis has certain aspects to it. These are:

==== Digestion, analysis and acid fractionation correction ====
Clumped isotopic analysis is usually done by gas source mass spectrometry where the CO2 liberated from magnesite by phosphoric acid digestion is fed into the isotope ratio mass spectrometer. In such scenario, one needs to ensure that liberation of CO2 from magnesite is complete. Digesting magnesite is hard since it takes a long time and different labs report different digestion times and temperatures (from 12 hours at 100 °C to 1 hour at 90 °C in phosphoric acid). Due to digestion at this high temperature, some of the 13C-18O bonds in the liberated CO2 are broken (leading to reduction in abundance of &#x27;clumped&#x27; CO2) during phosphoric acid digestion of carbonates. To account for this additional (analytical artifact), a correction called the &#x27;acid fractionation correction&#x27; is added to the magnesite clumped isotope value obtained at temperature of digestion.

Since the CO2 gas is liberated from carbonate mineral during acid digestion, leaving one O behind- a fractionation occurs, and the isotopic composition of the analyzed CO2 gas needs to be corrected for this. For magnesite, the most reliable fractionation factor( equation is given as:

&quot;103ln(α) = [(6.845 ± 0.475)∗105/T2] + (4.22 ± 0.08); T in K&quot;

Different researchers have also used other fractionation factors like dolomite fractionation factor.

==== Standards ====
While measuring samples of unknown composition, it is required to measure some standard materials (see Reference materials for stable isotope analysis). With internal standards and reference materials, analytical session is routinely monitored. Standard materials are majorly calcite and marble.

==== Δ47 – Temperature calibration ====
To convert clumped isotope data into temperature, a calibration curve is required which expresses the functional form of temperature dependence of clumped isotope composition. No mineral specific calibration exists for magnesite. Based on some experimental data where mineral precipitation temperature and clumped isotope derived temperature doesn&#x27;t match, a need of mineral specific calibration emerges. The mismatch arises since bonding in magnesite is different from calcite/dolomite and/or acid digestion is conducted at higher temperature.

==== Magnesite-water and CO2-magnesite isotope fractionation factors ====
Using clumped isotope derived temperature, C and O isotopic composition of the parental fluid can be calculated using known magnesite-fluid isotope fractionation factors, since fractionation is temperature dependent. Reported magnesite-fluid O and C isotope fractionation factors in literature are not in agreement with each other. The fractionation behaviors have not been substantiated by experimental observation.

=== Factors controlling isotopic structure in magnesite ===
==== Conversion from hydrous Mg-carbonates to magnesite ====
In low temperature, thus, hydrous Mg-carbonates (hydromagnesite, nesquehonite etc.) form. It is possible to convert these phases into magnesite by changing temperature by mineral dissolution-precipitation or dehydration. While so happens, an isotope effect associated can control the isotopic composition of precipitated magnesite.

==== Disequilibrium ====
Disequilibrium processes like degassing, rapid CO2 uptake etc. modify clumped isotopic composition of carbonate minerals specifically at low temperatures. They variably enrich or deplete the system in heavy isotopes of C and O. Since clumped isotope abundance depends on abundance of isotopes of C and O, they are also modified. Another very prominent effect here is that of pH of precipitating fluid. As pH of precipitating fluid changes, DIC pool is affected and isotopic composition of precipitating carbonate changes. 

==== Mineral structure and later thermal effects ====
Crystalline and cryptocrystalline magnesites have very different mineral structures. While crystalline magnesite has a well developed crystal structure, the cryptocrystalline magnesite is amorphous- mostly aggregate of fine grains. Since clumped isotopic composition depends on specific bonding, difference in crystal structure is very likely to affect the way clumped isotopic signatures are recorded in these different structures. This leads to the fact that their pristine signatures might be modified differently by later thermal events like diagenesis/burial heating etc.

=== Information on formation from isotopic structure ===
Clumped isotopes have been used in interpreting conditions of magnesite formation and the isotopic composition of the precipitating fluid. Within ultramafic complexes, magnesites are found within veins and stockworks in cryptocrystalline form as well as within carbonated peridotite units in crystalline form. These cryptocrystalline forms are mostly variably weathered and yield low temperature of formation. On the other hand, coarse magnesites yield very high temperature indicating hydrothermal origin. It is speculated that coarse high temperature magnesites are formed from mantle derived fluids whereas cryptocrystalline ones are precipitated by circulating meteoric water, taking up carbon from dissolved inorganic carbon pool, soil carbon and affected by disequilibrium isotope effects.

Magnesites forming in lakes and playa settings are in general enriched in heavy isotopes of C and O because of evaporation and CO2 degassing. This reflects in the clumped isotope derived temperature being very low. These are affected by pH effect, biological activity as well as kinetic isotope effect associated with degassing. Magnesite forms as surface moulds in such conditions but more generally occur as hydrous Mg-carbonates since their precipitation is kinetically favored. Most of the times, they derive C from DIC or nearby ultramafic complexes (e.g., Altin Playa, British Columbia, Canada).

Magnesites in metamorphic rocks, on the other hand, indicate very high temperature of formation. Isotopic composition of parental fluid is also heavy- generally metamorphic fluids. This has been verified by fluid inclusion derived temperature as well as traditional O isotope thermometry involving co-precipitating quartz-magnesite.

Often, magnesite records lower clumped isotope temperature than associated dolomite, calcite. The reason might be that calcite, dolomite form earlier at higher temperature (from mantle like fluids) which increases Mg/Ca ratio in the fluid sufficiently so as to precipitate magnesite. As this happens with increasing time, fluid cools, evolves by mixing with other fluids and when it forms magnesite, it decreases its temperature. So the presence of associated carbonates have a control on magnesite isotopic composition.

Origin of Martian carbonates can be deconvolved with the application of clumped isotope. Source of the CO2, climatic-hydrologic conditions on Mars could be assessed from these rocks. Recent study has shown (implementing clumped isotope thermometry) that carbonates in ALH84001 indicate formation at low temperature evaporative condition from subsurface water and derivation of CO2 from Martian atmosphere.

== Occupational safety and health ==
People can be exposed to magnesite in the workplace by inhaling it, skin contact, and eye contact.

=== United States ===
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for magnesite exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 10 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday.

<text>Arnobius (died c. 330) was an early Christian apologist of Berber origin during the reign of Diocletian (284–305). 

According to Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle,&quot; Arnobius, before his conversion, was a distinguished Numidian rhetorician at Sicca Veneria (El Kef, Tunisia), a major Christian center in Proconsular Africa, and owed his conversion to a premonitory dream. However, Arnobius writes dismissively of dreams in his surviving book.

According to Jerome, to overcome the doubts of the local bishop as to the earnestness of his Christian belief he wrote (c. 303, from evidence in IV:36) an apologetic work in seven books, which St. Jerome calls but which is entitled in the only (9th-century) manuscript that has survived. Jerome&#x27;s reference, his remark that Lactantius was a pupil of Arnobius and the surviving treatise are all the surviving facts about Arnobius.
 was composed in response to arguments justifying Diocletian&#x27;s persecution of Christians by claiming that Christians had brought the wrath of the gods on Ancient Rome. 

Arnobius, whom Revilo P. Oliver describes as &quot;a practitioner of the turgid and coarse style that is called African&quot;, is a vigorous apologist for Christianity. He holds the heathen gods to be real beings, but subordinate to the supreme Christian God. He also affirms that the human soul (Book II, 14 - 62) is not the work of God, but of an intermediate being, and is not immortal by nature, but capable of putting on immortality as a grace. Arnobius argues that a belief in the soul&#x27;s immortality would tend to remove moral restraint, and have a prejudicial effect on human life. 

Never specifically identifying his pagan adversaries, some of whom may be straw men, set up to be demolished, Arnobius argues in defence of monotheism, Christianity (), and the divinity of Christ. He praises Christianity&#x27;s rapid diffusion, credits it with civilizing barbarians, and describes it as being in consonance with Platonism.

In order to argue against pagan and idolatry, Arnobius goes into significant detail about pagan worship, drawing on sources such as Cornelius Labeo. In books III through V, he describes temples, idols, and the Graeco-Roman cult practice of his time; in books VI and VII, sacrifices and the worship of images.

In book 2 section 4 of , Arnobius gives the first known version of the argument later called Pascal&#x27;s Wager, that in case of doubt about religion one should commit to it because of the rewards of doing so and risks of not doing so. He argues:

The work of Arnobius appears to have been written when he was a recent convert, for he does not possess a very extensive knowledge of Scripture. He knows nothing of the Old Testament, and only the life of Christ in the New, while he does not quote directly from the Gospels. He was much influenced by Lucretius and had read Plato. His statements concerning Greek and Roman mythology are based respectively on the &quot;Protrepticus&quot; of Clement of Alexandria, and on Cornelius Labeo, who belonged to the preceding generation and attempted to restore Neoplatonism.

 survived in a single ninth-century manuscript in Paris (and a bad copy of it in Brussels). The French manuscript also contains the &quot;Octavius&quot; of Marcus Minucius Felix.

<text>Sky Replay is a British pay television channel operated by Sky that began broadcasting in December 2002 as Sky One Mix.

The channel was previously known as Sky Two from 2005 to 2020. The brand name and format had earlier been used for a similar service which broadcast on analogue platforms for a year from 1996. Whereas Sky One had been available in HD since 2006, Sky Two has always been exclusively available in standard definition. 

On 27 August 2020, the service adopted its current branding. Sky Replay now serves as a sister channel to Sky Max and Sky Witness; broadcasting repeats of programmes aired on those channels and also broadcasts repeats of drama series that Sky no longer holds first run rights or rights that are soon to expire.
==History==
The Sky 2 brand was originally launched on 1 September 1996, and served as a sister channel to Sky 1 in the evening (timesharing with Fox Kids). The channel was introduced to offer an expanded range of general entertainment programming, with Sky 2 airing a mixture of programmes already carried on Sky 1 along with programmes exclusive to the channel. Sky 2 however was not as successful as Sky had hoped, and would close nearly a year later without any notice on 31 August 1997. The channel was then replaced by the UK&#x27;s version of National Geographic.

===Launch as Sky One Mix (2002–2005)===
On 7 October 2002, Sky announced that they would launch their first digital channel in over a decade; Sky One Mix, functioning as Sky One&#x27;s sister channel and catch-up service. The channel&#x27;s launch was announced for 9 December on 13 November 2002 and launched on Sky Digital that day.

The channel, initially broadcasting from noon to midnight, offered up the best of Sky One&#x27;s programmes, as well as a dedicated children&#x27;s block called &quot;Animix&quot;, which broadcast from 3:30pm every weekday. The channel used a logo and presentation design similar to that used by Sky One at the time, but with a yellow and black theme as opposed to the orange and white used by Sky One at the time. 

Initially exclusive to Sky Digital, the channel was added to NTL at the end of July 2003 as part of a two-year contract extension between BSkyB and NTL.

On 21 September 2004, to coincide with the launch of Sky One&#x27;s new look, Sky One Mix was rebranded as simply Sky Mix. The channel would keep Sky One&#x27;s previous branding as before, and kept the same idents without the mention of the word &quot;One&quot;. 

===Sky Two (2005–2020)===
On 18 July 2005, rumours circulated that Sky was planning to extend the Sky One brand by rebranding Sky Mix as Sky Two, and launching a Sky Three as well. The channel rebranded effectively to Sky Two in November of that year, and began using Kaktus Films&#x27; animated idents in line with those introduced on Sky One the prior year. 

On Thursday 1 March 2007, Sky Two, alongside other non-premium Sky networks, were removed from Virgin Media following a contract dispute between Virgin Media and BSkyB caused by the expiry of their carriage agreement and their inability to reach a new deal. When Sky Two was removed, Virgin Media renamed the slot on the EPG as &quot;Old Sky Two Try Living&quot;, before it was removed completely. 

In February 2008, Sky Two began utilising the same short-lived range of idents that its sister channels used, except using a &quot;Green&quot; range of graphics. 

On 31 August 2008, the channel adopted a revised branding of Sky2, when Sky&#x27;s entertainment channels relaunched with numeric names and shared branding elements, utilising blue solids (Sky1), green liquids (Sky2) and pink particles (Sky3).

On 13 November 2008, following the agreement of a new deal between BSkyB and Virgin Media, Sky2 along with Sky&#x27;s other non-premium channels returned to Virgin Media&#x27;s television service. 

From 10 May to 9 August 2010, Sky conducted an experimental revision of service, under which Sky2 ceased to run its own full-time programme schedule, and instead predominantly operated a one-hour timeshift of programming on Sky1. Sky2 would, however, retain standalone branding. A Sky spokesperson said: &quot;We are experimenting with different channel schedules to bring maximum value to our customers.&quot; Some programmes were excluded from the timeshift device and replaced by alternate content on Sky2 during this period. Shows which weren&#x27;t shown on the time-delay included the premiere of Sky1&#x27;s &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Going Postal&quot;, the station&#x27;s adaptation of the author&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; novel. Also not seen on a timeshift basis was the final episode of &quot;Lost&quot;; which was aired at 5am, as a simultaneous broadcast with the United States. The last episodes of &quot;24&quot; (which Sky showed as a two-part finale ) also weren&#x27;t shown an hour later on Sky2. The non-timeshifted programming would often be found an alternative slot on Sky2 (&quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Going Postal&quot; would be shown later in the week). This period as a &#x27;time shuffle&#x27; channel would draw comparisons between Sky2 and Channel Four&#x27;s 4seven. The timeshift trial concluded on 9 August 2010, with Sky2 reverting to its previous scheduling pattern.

On 1 February 2011, Sky refreshed the presentation on many of its channels. Sky2&#x27;s new idents would follow along the same themes as Sky One&#x27;s, but the action is in close-up, featuring a small metal &#x27;2&#x27; icon (in contrast to Sky1&#x27;s giant &#x27;1&#x27; symbol). Sky1 would later switch to programme-themed idents, whilst Sky2 largely continued to use the 2011 sequences. In April 2016, when Sky1 got new animated identity sequences, Sky2 received a revised version of its 2011 films, with a larger Sky2 logo caption appearing at the end of the sequence, and the backing music changed to that previously used by the Sky1 version of the films.

Since 2011, Sky2 has been progressively moved down the programme guide on the Sky satellite platform to make room for other services. In February 2011, to make way for the relaunched Sky Living, Sky2 moved to channel 129, previously home to Syfy UK. On 21 February 2012, Sky2 moved up to 121; previously owned by Sky Living +1. In 2015, with the re-combination of Sky Arts into a single channel, and its move up the grid, Sky2 moved back to 129. In Summer 2017, the relaunch of Sky Sports into genre-based channels saw the move of Sky Sports Mix into the entertainment guide, resulting in the relocation of other services including Sky2. 

On 9 October 2017, as part of the re-branding and presentation on Sky&#x27;s entertainment channels, the Sky Two branding was reintroduced nine years after the switch to numerals. Sky Two dropped its previous filmed idents in favour of using an animated sting featuring the new channel logo.

On 1 May 2018, Sky Two moved up to channel 123 as part of another reshuffling by Sky; replacing ITV Encore, which closed on the same day. On 22 October 2018, the channel moved down to 151, swapping places with E! Europe. 

On 1 October 2019, the channel moved down to 170 following the closure of Real Lives and launch of Sky Crime. The following month, the channel was moved again to 168 following the closure of YourTV on 19 November 2019.

===Sky Replay (2020–present)===
On 27 August 2020, Sky Two was rebranded as Sky Replay and moved to Sky channel 145 as a result. The slot&#x27;s previous occupant, Sky Sports Mix, moved to channel 416.

On 8 November 2022, Sky Replay swapped channel numbers with sister channel Challenge.

==Programming==

Sky Replay is in many ways a catch-up service for Sky&#x27;s main entertainment channels, Sky Witness and Sky Max, broadcasting their popular shows. Doing so, Sky Two is described as a &quot;time shuffle&quot; channel, so called to distinguish it from timeshift channels, which rebroadcast their principal channel, delayed by one hour.

Following the closure of the original Sky Real Lives in 2010, some of its factual and reality programming was relocated to Sky Two. Following the closure of Bravo in 2011, Sky Two adopted some of its programming, particularly in the science-fiction, drama and documentary fields.

With the retooling of Sky Living into the crime and procedural focused Sky Witness, some former Sky Living programming (such as &quot;Four Weddings&quot;, &quot;My Kitchen Rules&quot; and &quot;Most Haunted&quot;) has transferred into the Sky Replay daytime schedule. Sky Replay also broadcasts repeats of drama series that Sky no longer holds first run rights or rights that are soon to expire.

Sky Replay as of Autumn 2024 no longer operates as a 7 day Catch Up service for Sky Witness and Sky Max

==International==
A version of Sky Replay for Germany launched on Sky Deutschland and Sky Ticket on 4 October 2021, replacing the previous local box-set channel Sky Serien &amp; Shows.

<text>Teatrul Evreiesc de Stat (TES, the State Jewish Theater) in Bucharest, Romania is a theater specializing in Jewish-related plays. It is the oldest Yiddish-language theater with uninterrupted activity in the world. Its contemporary repertoire includes plays by Jewish authors, plays on Jewish topics, and plays in Yiddish (which are performed with simultaneous translation into Romanian, using headphones installed in the theater in the 1970s). Many of the plays also feature Jewish actors.

A precursor, the &quot;Teatru Evreiesc Baraşeum&quot; operated as a Jewish theater through most of World War II, although they were closed during the few months of the National Legionary State, and thereafter performed in Romanian rather than Yiddish through until the fall of Ion Antonescu.

==Prehistory==
The Jewish Theatre in Romania has a tradition dating back to the 19th century. The first newspaper reference to a Jewish theater in Romania was a review by Mihai Eminescu in the Romanian newspaper &quot;Curierul de Iaşi&quot; (&quot;The Courier of Iaşi&quot;) in 1876, in which he described a troupe of six Jewish actors who performed in the famous &quot;Green Tree&quot; garden of Iaşi under Avram Goldfaden’s management, the father of the modern Jewish Theatre.

In Bucharest, the theater building, the &quot;Teatru Baraşeum&quot; or &quot;Sala Baraşeum&quot;, was used from the early 1930s as a Yiddish-language theater, originally under private management. The theater was named in honor of Dr. Iuliu Barasch, as was an adjoining clinic. (The street it is on, the former str. Ionescu de la Brad, is now str. Dr. Iuliu Barasch.) On the verge of World War II, it was home of the &quot;Thalia&quot; company, one of four professional Yiddish theater companies in Bucharest at that time.

As war broke out in Europe and the antisemitic right-wing politics that had long been a factor in Romania came to the fore, resources for Yiddish theater in Bucharest dried up. In the summer of 1940, all four Bucharest-based Yiddish theater companies, including &quot;Thalia&quot;, set out on tours of the country rather than attempt summer theater in Bucharest. &quot;Thalia&quot; were on the road when King Carol II abdicated on September 6, 1940, the start of the National Legionary State under General (later Marshal) Ion Antonescu. The extremely antisemitic Iron Guard became the only legal political party in Romania. On September 9, Jews were prohibited from participating in theater. All Jews were fired from artistic or administrative positions at the National Theater and others, and the country&#x27;s Yiddish-language companies had their licenses revoked. Public use of the Yiddish language was also banned.

Nonetheless, after some petitioning, permission was obtained on September 26 to start a single Jewish theater in Bucharest, subject to conditions such as making donations to a fund for unemployed Christian actors, performing only in Romanian, and getting permission from the Military Commander of the capital. Some 200 people were associated with the group that emerged, ranging from performers of light comedy to actors versed in the method acting of Konstantin Stanislavski, and representing a wide range of politics and all levels of experience.

The company wanted to rent the Roxy Theater in the central Lipscani district, but were told that they would only be allowed to perform in the Jewish ghetto; the Baraşeum in the Văcăreşti neighborhood met this requirement.

Over the next six months, the company would struggle with the authorities over the conditions under which they could open, while awaiting the elusive permission from the Military Commander. A January 17, 1941 document from the Minister of Culture and from Director General of Theaters and Operas Liviu Rebreanu added new requirements: each individual artist would need approval from the Director General of Theaters; no plays could be performed on major Christian holidays, nor on the three &quot;legionary holidays&quot;; they could use only the front door of the &quot;Baraşeum&quot; on str. Ionescu de la Brad, not the stage door on str. Udricani; and they could not open until May 31, 1941, four and a half months away. Days after these requirements were put in place, the Iron Guard attempted a coup against Antonescu; the Guard&#x27;s defeat resulted in a government less actively hostile to Jews. These new requirements were relaxed after the defeat of the Iron Guard, and Rebreanu wrote on February 19 that &quot;in view of the current situation&quot; they could open on March 1. The Military Commander never did give formal permission, but that requirement seems to have been ignored.

==Baraşeum Jewish Theater==
On March 1, 1941 Teatrul Evreiesc Baraşeum (the Baraşeum Jewish Theater) opened with a revue, &quot;Ce faci astă seară?&quot; (&quot;What are you doing this evening?&quot;). Five days later they premiered a production of &quot;The Brothers Sanger&quot; by Margereth Kennedy. They changed the name to &quot;Gema&quot; and also substituted a different author&#x27;s name (since they were only allowed to do plays by Jews).

During the war years, the Baraşeum Jewish Theater premiered over thirty productions, about half of them directed by Sandru Eliad. Although officially exclusively Jewish, at times various Gentile intellectuals helped the company illegally, especially with translations; this was well enough known to provoke indignation from at least one antisemitic newspaper. Some Gentiles, mostly intellectuals, showed support for the theater by coming to performances.

At times their plays were heavily censored. For example, on one occasion they were required to drop the lines &quot;Je sais bien que demain tout peut changer&quot; (&quot;I know that tomorrow everything could change&quot;) and &quot;L&#x27;histoire est à tournant&quot; (&quot;The story/history is at a turning point&quot;) from a French love song, lest they be understood politically. At other times, though, they sneaked in the occasional Yiddish-language joke or refrain.

Israil Bercovici, later a key figure in the State Jewish Theater, has said of this period that Jewish theater was pushed to the periphery, but &quot;turned that periphery into a center of Jewish culture and art&quot;. Their included Romanian-language translations of classic Yiddish theater pieces such as the bittersweet &quot;Dos Groise Ghivens&quot; (&quot;The Big Lottery Ticket&quot;, a musical based on a story by Sholom Aleichem) and S. Ansky&#x27;s &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; as well as new pieces, and performances of works by the acceptably Jewish Jacques Offenbach and Louis Verneuil.

On August 23, 1944 the overthrow of Antonescu in a coup led immediately to the re-legalization of the use of the Yiddish language. The Baraşeum returned to performing in Yiddish, presenting Sholom Aleichem&#x27;s &quot;Mentshn&quot; (&quot;Men&quot;) on September 15. This Baraşeum production was not, however, the first Yiddish play after of the new period. On the very evening of August 23 an improvised Yiddish performance &quot;Nacht-Tog&quot; (&quot;Night-Day&quot;) took place in Botoşani — the town where, in 1876, Avram Goldfaden had presented one of the first professional Yiddish language productions, the first ever in an indoor theater.

==IKUF==
This group who had improvised the play in Botoşani were part of the Yiddisher Kultur Ferband (IKUF). They would evolve and repeat their performance of &quot;Nacht-Tog&quot;. This performance was sharply divided into two parts, &quot;Nacht&quot; being the dark past and &quot;Tog&quot; expressing a belief in life. The play used songs both from the forced labor camps and from Yiddish theater before the war.

IKUF would become a key institution in the next few years, publishing a magazine &quot;IKUF Bleter&quot;, organizing libraries and conferences, and evolving Teatrul IKUF, a new Yiddish theater led initially by Iacob Mansdorf. Drawing its mostly young, professional actors from cities around Romania, their production of Moşe Pincevski&#x27;s new play &quot;Ich Leb&quot; (&quot;I Live&quot;) about resistance in a forced labor camp put them on the map in a Bucharest where the Communist Party was moving toward hegemony. Ceremonies for the play&#x27;s opening included a number of speakers, including Minister of Art Mihail Ralea and Iosif Eselaohn of the socialist party Ihud.

Mansdorf, according to Bercovici, tired of leading a theater troupe after only two years; some of his actors left with him. Others, including Sevilla Pastor, Dina König, Seidy Glück, Moris Siegler and Marcu Glückman, reorganized under Bernard Lebli, and became the new permanent company of the Baraşeum, with an unprecedented subsidy from the government. They began their new season January 11, 1948 with &quot;Dos Groise Ghivens&quot;; this was followed by &quot;Nekomenemer&quot; (&quot;The Song of War&quot;) by French Yiddish writer Haim Sloves.

==The State Jewish Theater==

After the rise of Communism in Romania, the IKUF theater was nationalized August 1, 1948 as the State Jewish Theater (Teatrul Evreiesc de Stat, TES). A second Romanian State Jewish Theater was established in Iaşi in 1949, but went out of existence in 1964.

TES has operated in the former Baraşeum building almost continually since that time. In 1954–1956 the theater building was rebuilt with a modern stage; the company appeared on a number of other Bucharest stages during that time. In 1955 Franz Auerbach became head of the theater with Iancu Gluck as General Manager and Israil Bercovici as literary secretary. Over the next two decades, these three would doubtless do as much as anyone in the world to keep the flame of Yiddish theater alive. (Auerbach&#x27;s successor, Harry Eliad, continues to run the theater .)

The first production on the new stage in their building (now called, like the company, Teatrul Evreiesc de Stat, but still sometimes referred to as the Baraşeum) was &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, with Samuel Fischler as Otto Frank. For four years (1957–1961), TES also operated a studio theater to train young actors and stage technicians, in which some of the surviving greats of Yiddish theater taught their crafts to a new generation.

The company toured to Israel in 1968, to the United States and Canada in 1972, and to East Berlin in 1977.

The repertoire of TES has included many works with music by their own Haim Schwartzman. They have performed traditional works of the Yiddish theater, and new plays by Ludovic Bruckstein,
(or I.L. or Leibush Brukstein, 1920-1988)
who wrote between 1948 and 1969 a series of plays both in Yiddish and Romanian. Bruckstein, a survivor of
Auschwitz and several other concentration-camps, wrote in 1948 a play entitled &quot;Night-Shift&quot; 
(Nachtshicht, in Yiddish) describing the revolt of the Auschwitz sonderkommando towards 
the end of the Second World-War, and the play had a huge success over the years 1949-1958.
Subsequently, TES, The Yiddish Theater in Iaşi, and other Theaters in Romania played a series of his plays, 
(The Grunwald Family in 1952, The Return of Christopher Columbus, 1955, Dor Hamidbar, or The Desert Generation in 1957, 
An Unfinished Trial in 1961, White Night, 1963, and Meeting on the Mountain in 1969), and Bruckstein became, before his 1972 emigration to Israel, the most important Yiddish playwright of post-war Romania, as mentioned in the Encyclopaedia Judaica, see also YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe on Romanian literature.
TES also staged works by Romanian playwrights such as Victor Eftimiu, Victor Ion Popa, Tudor Arghezi, and Lucia Demetrius, and but also a vast array of works from world theater: Bertholt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot;, Reginald Rose&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, Georg Büchner&#x27;s &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, Lion Feuchtwanger&#x27;s &quot;Raquel, The Jewess of Toledo&quot;, and Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s &quot;Frank V&quot;. More recent additions to their repertoire include works by Israel Horovitz and Ray Cooney, and an adaptation by Dorel Dorian of Saul Bellow&#x27;s &quot;Herzog&quot;.

During the Communist era, TES had some interesting exchanges with other Romanian theaters. TES&#x27;s Mauriciu Sekler directed Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage&quot; at the National Theater; Franz Auerbach directed several plays are the State German Theater in Timișoara. Conversely, non-Jewish actors such as George Trodorescu, Lucu Andreescu, Ştefan Hablinski, and Dan Jitianu played major roles in productions at TES.

Despite significant repression of Jews during some phases of the Communist regime, despite significant emigration of Romanian Jews, and despite the demolition of much of the Văcăreşti neighborhood in anticipation of a never-finished portion of Centrul Civic, the theater continued to operate until the end of the communist era in the Romanian Revolution of 1989. It still continues today () as a public institution, receiving a subsidy from the General Council of the Municipality of Bucharest. Along with the nearby Jewish Museum, it is one of the two most prominent remaining secular Jewish institutions in Romania, continuing what Bercovici called &quot;a tradition of humanist theater&quot;.

<text>Java Man (Homo erectus erectus, formerly also Anthropopithecus erectusor&quot; Pithecanthropus erectus&quot;) is an early human fossil discovered in 1891 and 1892 on the island of Java (Indonesia). Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,490,000 years old, it was, at the time of its discovery, the oldest hominid fossil ever found, and it remains the type specimen for &quot;Homo erectus&quot;.

Led by Eugène Dubois, the excavation team uncovered a tooth, a skullcap, and a thighbone at Trinil on the banks of the Solo River in East Java. Arguing that the fossils represented the &quot;missing link&quot; between apes and humans, Dubois gave the species the scientific name &quot;Anthropopithecus erectus&quot;, then later renamed it &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot;. The fossil aroused much controversy. Within a decade of the discovery almost eighty books or articles had been published on Dubois&#x27;s finds. Despite Dubois&#x27;s argument, few accepted that Java Man was a transitional form between apes and humans. Some dismissed the fossils as apes and others as modern humans, whereas many scientists considered Java Man as a primitive side branch of evolution not related to modern humans at all. In the 1930s Dubois made the claim that &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; was built like a &quot;giant gibbon&quot;, a much misinterpreted attempt by Dubois to prove that it was the &quot;missing link&quot;. Eventually, similarities between Java Man and &quot;Sinanthropus pekinensis&quot; (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both &quot;Homo erectus&quot; in 1950, placing them directly in the human evolutionary tree.

To distinguish Java Man from other &quot;Homo erectus&quot; populations, some scientists began to regard it as a subspecies, &quot;Homo erectus erectus&quot;, in the 1970s. Other fossils found in the first half of the twentieth century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. The fossils of Java Man have been housed at the Rijksmuseum van Geologie en Mineralogie and later Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.

==History of discoveries==
===Background===

Charles Darwin had argued that humanity evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin&#x27;s claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who thought of a similar theory of evolution around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons or another great ape (the orangutans), they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.

===Trinil fossils===
In October 1887, Dubois abandoned his academic career and left for the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) to look for the fossilized ancestor of modern man. Having received no funding from the Dutch government for his eccentric endeavorsince no one at the time had ever found an early human fossil while looking for ithe joined the Dutch East Indies Army as a military surgeon. Because of his work duties, it was only in July 1888 that he began to excavate caves in Sumatra. Having quickly found abundant fossils of large mammals, Dubois was relieved of his military duties (March 1889), and the colonial government assigned two engineers and fifty convicts to help him with his excavations. After he failed to find the fossils he was looking for on Sumatra, he moved on to Java in 1890.

Again assisted by convict laborers and two army corporals, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long cranium with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first gave them the name &quot;Anthropopithecus&quot; (&quot;man-ape&quot;), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named &quot;Anthropopithecus&quot;, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.

In August 1892, a year later, Dubois&#x27;s team found a long femur (thighbone) shaped like a human one, suggesting that its owner had stood upright. The femur bone was found 50 feet (approx. 15 meters) from the original find one year earlier. Believing that the three fossils belonged to a single individual, &quot;probably a very aged female&quot;, Dubois renamed the specimen &quot;Anthropopithecus erectus&quot;. Only in late 1892, when he determined that the cranium measured about , did Dubois consider that his specimen was a transitional form between apes and humans. In 1894, he thus renamed it &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot; (&quot;upright ape-man&quot;), borrowing the genus name &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; from Ernst Haeckel, who had coined it a few years earlier to refer to a supposed &quot;missing link&quot; between apes and humans. This specimen has also been known as Pithecanthropus 1.

===Comparisons with Peking Man===

In 1927, Canadian Davidson Black identified two fossilized teeth he had found in Zhoukoudian near Beijing as belonging to an ancient human, and named his specimen &quot;Sinanthropus pekinensis&quot;, now better known as Peking Man. In December 1929, the first of several skullcaps was found on the same site, and it appeared similar but slightly larger than Java Man. Franz Weidenreich, who replaced Black in China after the latter&#x27;s death in 1933, argued that &quot;Sinanthropus&quot; was also a transitional fossil between apes and humans, and was in fact so similar to Java&#x27;s &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; that they should both belong to the family Hominidae. Eugène Dubois categorically refused to entertain this possibility, dismissing Peking Man as a kind of Neanderthal, closer to humans than the &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot;, and insisting that Pithecanthropus belonged to its own superfamily, the Pithecanthropoidea.

===Other discoveries on Java===

After the discovery of Java Man, Berlin-born paleontologist G. H. R. von Koenigswald recovered several other early human fossils in Java. Between 1931 and 1933 von Koenigswald discovered fossils of Solo Man from sites along the Bengawan Solo River on Java, including several skullcaps and cranial fragments. In 1936, von Koenigswald discovered a juvenile skullcap known as the Mojokerto child in East Java. Considering the Mojokerto child skull cap to be closely related to humans, von Koenigswald wanted to name it &quot;Pithecanthropus modjokertensis&quot; (after Dubois&#x27;s specimen), but Dubois protested that Pithecanthropus was not a human but an &quot;ape-man&quot;.

Von Koenigswald also made several discoveries in Sangiran, Central Java, where more fossils of early humans were discovered between 1936 and 1941. Among the discoveries was a skullcap of similar size to that found by Dubois at the Trinil 2 site. Von Koenigswald&#x27;s discoveries in Sangiran convinced him that all these skulls belonged to early humans. Dubois again refused to acknowledge the similarity. Ralph von Koenigswald and Franz Weidenreich compared the fossils from Java and Zhoukoudian and concluded that Java Man and Peking Man were closely related. Dubois died in 1940, still refusing to recognize their conclusion, and official reports remain critical of the Sangiran site&#x27;s poor presentation and interpretation.

==Early interpretations==

More than 50 years after Dubois&#x27;s find, Ralph von Koenigswald recollected that, &quot;No other paleontological discovery has created such a sensation and led to such a variety of conflicting scientific opinions.&quot; The &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; fossils were so immediately controversial that by the end of the 1890s, almost 80 publications had already discussed them.

Until the Taung childthe 2.8 million-year-old remains of an &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;were discovered in South Africa in 1924, Dubois&#x27;s and Koenigswald&#x27;s discoveries were the oldest hominid remains ever found. Some scientists of the day suggested that Dubois&#x27;s Java Man was a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other great apes. The current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (&quot;Homo ergaster&quot;), rather than the Asian populations of the same species exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man.

===Missing link theory===
Dubois first published his find in 1894. Dubois&#x27;s central claim was that &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; was a transitional form between apes and humans, a so-called &quot;missing link&quot;. Many disagreed. Some critics claimed that the bones were those of an upright walking ape, or that they belonged to a primitive human. This judgment made sense at a time when an evolutionary view of humanity had not yet been widely accepted, and scientists tended to view hominid fossils as racial variants of modern humans rather than as ancestral forms. After Dubois let a number of scientists examine the fossils in a series of conferences held in Europe in the 1890s, they started to agree that Java Man may be a transitional form after all, but most of them thought of it as &quot;an extinct side branch&quot; of the human tree that had indeed descended from apes, but not evolved into humans. This interpretation eventually imposed itself and remained dominant until the 1940s.
Dubois was bitter about this and locked the fossil up in a trunk until 1923 when he showed it to Ales Hrdlicka from the Smithsonian Institution. In response to critics who refused to accept that Java Man was a &quot;missing link&quot;, in 1932 Dubois published a paper arguing that the Trinil bones looked like those of a &quot;giant gibbon&quot;. Dubois&#x27;s use of the phrase has been widely misinterpreted as a retraction, but it was intended an argument to support his claim that &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; was a transitional form. According to Dubois, evolution occurred by leaps, and the ancestors of humanity had doubled their brain-to-body ratio on each leap. To prove that Java Man was the &quot;missing link&quot; between apes and humans, he therefore had to show that its brain-to-body ratio was double that of apes and half that of humans. The problem was that Java Man&#x27;s cranial capacity was 900 cubic centimeters, about two-thirds of modern humans&#x27;.

Like many scientists who believed that modern humans evolved &quot;Out of Asia&quot;, Dubois thought that gibbons were closest to humans among the great apes. To preserve the proportions predicted by his theory of brain evolution, Dubois argued that Java Man was shaped more like a gibbon than a human. Imagined &quot;with longer arms and a greatly expanded chest and upper body&quot;, the Trinil creature became a gigantic ape of about , but &quot;double cephalization of the anthropoid apes in general and half that of man&quot;. It was therefore halfway on the path to becoming a modern human. As Dubois concluded his 1932 paper: &quot;I still believe, now more firmly than ever, that the &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; of Trinil is the real &#x27;missing link.&#x27;&quot;

===Reclassification as &quot;Homo erectus&quot;===

Based on Weidenreich&#x27;s work and on his suggestion that &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot; and &quot;Sinanthropus pekinensis&quot; were connected through a series of interbreeding populations, German biologist Ernst Mayr reclassified them both as being part of the same species: &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. Mayr presented his conclusion at the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium in 1950, and this resulted in Dubois&#x27;s &quot;erectus&quot; species being reclassified under the genus &quot;Homo&quot;. As part of the reclassification, Mayr included not only &quot;Sinanthropus&quot; and &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot;, but also &quot;Plesianthropus&quot;, &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, &quot;Javanthropus&quot;, and several other genera as synonyms, arguing that all human ancestors were part of a single genus (&quot;Homo&quot;), and that &quot;never one more than one species of man existed on the earth at any one time&quot;. A &quot;revolution in taxonomy&quot;, Mayr&#x27;s single-species approach to human evolution was quickly accepted. It shaped paleoanthropology in the 1950s and lasted into the 1970s, when the African genus &quot;Australopithecus&quot; was accepted into the human evolutionary tree.

In the 1970s, a tendency developed to regard the Javanese variety of &quot;H. erectus&quot; as a subspecies, &quot;Homo erectus erectus&quot;, with the Chinese variety being referred to as &quot;Homo erectus pekinensis&quot;.

==Post-discovery analysis==
===Date of the fossils===


Dubois&#x27;s complete collection of fossils were transferred between 1895 and 1900 to what is now known as Naturalis, in Leiden in the Netherlands. The main fossil of Java Man, the skullcap cataloged as &quot;Trinil 2&quot;, has been dated biostratigraphically, that is, by correlating it with a group of fossilized animals (a &quot;faunal assemblage&quot;) found nearby on the same geological horizon, which is itself compared with assemblages from other layers and classified chronologically. Ralph von Koenigswald first assigned Java Man to the Trinil Fauna, a faunal assemblage that he composed from several Javanese sites. He concluded that the skullcap was about 700,000 years old, thus dating from the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene.

Though this view is still widely accepted, in the 1980s, a group of Dutch paleontologists used Dubois&#x27;s collection of more than 20,000 animal fossils to reassess the date of the layer in which Java Man was found. Using only fossils from Trinil, they called that new faunal assemblage the Trinil H. K. Fauna, in which H. K. stands for &quot;Haupt Knochenschicht&quot;, or &quot;main fossil-bearing layer&quot;. This assessment dates the fossils of Java Man to between 900,000 and 1,000,000 years old. On the other hand, work published in 2014 gives a &quot;maximum age of 0.54 ± 0.10 million years and a minimum age of 0.43 ± 0.05 million years&quot; for Ar-Ar and luminescence dating of sediment in human-predated shell material from Trinil. Work continues on assessing the dating of this complex site.

Other fossils attest to the even earlier presence of &quot;H. erectus&quot; in Java. Sangiran 2 (named after its discovery site) may be as old as 1.66 Ma (million years). The controversial Mojokerto child, which Carl C. Swisher and Garniss Curtis once dated to 1.81 ± 0.04 Ma, has now been convincingly re-dated to a maximum age of 1.49 ± 0.13 Ma, that is, 1.49 million years with a margin of error of plus or minus 130,000 years.

===Type specimen===
The fossils found in Java are considered the type specimen for &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Because the fossils of Java Man were found &quot;scattered in an alluvial deposit&quot;they had been laid there by the flow of a riverdetractors doubted that they belonged to the same species, let alone the same individual. German pathologist Rudolf Virchow, for instance, argued in 1895 that the femur was that of a gibbon. Dubois had difficulty convincing his critics, because he had not attended the excavation, and could not explain specifically enough the exact location of the bones. Because the Trinil thighbone looks very much like that of a modern human, it might have been a &quot;reworked fossil&quot;, that is, a relatively young fossil that was deposited into an older layer after its own layer had been eroded. For this reason, there is still dissent about whether all the Trinil fossils represent the same species.

==Physical characteristics==

Java Man was about tall and his thighbones show that he walked erect like modern humans. The femur is thicker than that of a modern human, indicating he was engaging in a lot of running. The skull was characterized by thick bones and a retreating forehead. The large teeth made the jaw large and jutting, with the lower lips overhanging the lower margin of the mandible, giving the impression of no chin. The browridges were straight and massive. At 900 cm3, his cranial capacity was smaller than that of later &quot;H. erectus&quot; specimens. However, he had humanlike teeth with large canines.

Judging from anatomical and archeological aspects as well as Java Man&#x27;s ecological role, meat from vertebrates was likely an important part of their diet. Java Man, like other &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, was probably a rare species. There is evidence that Java Man used shell tools to cut meat. Java Man&#x27;s dispersal through Southeast Asia coincides with the extirpation of the giant turtle &quot;Megalochelys&quot;, possibly due to overhunting as the turtle would have been an easy, slow-moving target which could have been stored for quite some time.

== Material culture ==
&quot;H. erectus&quot; arrived in Eurasia approximately 1.8 million years ago, in an event considered to be the first African exodus. There is evidence that the Java population of &quot;H. erectus&quot; lived in an ever-wet forest habitat. More specifically the environment resembled a savannah, but was likely regularly inundated (&quot;hydromorphic savanna&quot;). The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass (Poaceae), ferns, &quot;Ficus&quot;, and &quot;Indigofera&quot;, which are typical of lowland rainforest.

=== Control of fire ===
The control of fire by &quot;Homo erectus&quot; is generally accepted by archaeologists to have begun some 400,000 years ago, with claims regarding earlier evidence finding increasing scientific support. Burned wood has been found in layers that carried the Java Man fossils in Trinil, dating to around from 500,000 to 830,000 BP. However, because Central Java is a volcanic region, the charring may have resulted from natural fires, and there is no conclusive proof that &quot;Homo erectus&quot; in Java controlled fire. It has been proposed that Java Man was aware of the use of fire, and that the frequent presence of natural fires may have allowed Java Man &quot;opportunistic use [... that] did not create an archeologically visible pattern&quot;.

<text>The Sentences (. ) is a compendium of Christian theology written by Peter Lombard around 1150. It was the most important religious textbook of the Middle Ages.
==Background==
The sentence genre emerged from works like Prosper of Aquitaine&#x27;s &quot;Sententia&quot;, a collection of maxims by Augustine of Hippo. It was well-established by the time of Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Senteniae&quot;, one of the first systematic treatments of Christian theology. In the &quot;Sentences&quot;, Peter Lombard collects glosses from the Church Fathers. Glosses were marginalia in religious and legal texts used to correct, explain, or interpret a text. Gradually, these annotations were compiled into separate works. The most notable precedent for Lombard&#x27;s &quot;Sentences&quot; were the &quot;Glossa Ordinaria&quot;, a 12th-century collection of glosses.

Lombard went a step further by compiling them into one coherent whole. There had been much earlier efforts in this vein, most notably in John of Damascus&#x27; &quot;The Source of Knowledge&quot;. When John of Damascus&#x27; work was translated into Latin in 1150, Lombard had access to it.

Lombard was not alone in his project. Many other contemporary theologians were compiling glossaries, such as Robert of Melun&#x27;s &quot;Sententiae&quot; and Hugh of Saint Victor&#x27;s &quot;De sacramentis christianae fidei&quot;. In 1134, Lombard went to Paris to study with Hugh, who was finishing his work at the time. Their work was the signal development of 12th-century religious scholars: a systematic theology that treated the activity as a coherent practice. 

Lombard&#x27;s twin hurdles were devising an order for his material and reconciling differences among sources. Peter Abelard&#x27;s &quot;&quot; employed a method for reconciling authorities that Lombard knew and used. Abelard had also conceived of his work as a textbook. Lombard&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Magna glossatura&quot;, was an enormous success and quickly became a standard reference work. Compiling the &quot;Magna glossatura&quot; prepared Lombard for the definitive synthesis of the &quot;Sentences&quot;.

==Composition==
The &quot;Sentences&quot; were compiled in two phases. By 1154, he had completed an initial version of the text which he read to his students in Paris during the 1156–7 academic year. The following term, he had significantly revised the &quot;Sentences&quot;, and this became the definitive version. The first major manuscript of the &quot;Sentences&quot; was copied by Michael of Ireland in 1158. There are nearly 900 extant manuscripts of Lombard&#x27;s work, which indicates how widely it was used.

In addition to Lombard&#x27;s &quot;Magna glossatura&quot; and the &quot;Glossa Ordinaria&quot;, the &quot;Sentences&quot; relied heavily on the works of Augustine, citing him over 1,000 times. Julian of Toledo&#x27;s eschatology was heavily reflected in Lombard&#x27;s work. The &quot;Sentences&quot; were also a remarkable snapshot of current thought. Editorial choices like including a table of contents made Peter&#x27;s book a much more helpful reference than other glossaries.

==Contents==
Lombard arranged his material from the Bible and the Church Fathers in four books, then subdivided this material further into chapters. Probably between 1223 and 1227, Alexander of Hales grouped the many chapters of the four books into a smaller number of &quot;distinctions&quot;. In this form, the book was widely adopted as a theological textbook in the high and late Middle Ages (the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries). A commentary on the &quot;Sentences&quot; was required of every master of theology, and was part of the examination system. At the end of lectures on Lombard&#x27;s work, a student could apply for bachelor status within the theology faculty.

==Legacy==
In 1170, Pope Alexander III instructed William of Champgane to &quot;convoke your suffragans at Paris&quot; and renounce the &quot;vicious doctrine&quot; (&quot;pravae doctrinae&quot;) of Peter Lombard. The Pope was accusing Lombard of espousing Christological Nihilianism: the idea that Christ&#x27;s human nature was nothing and his sole identity was divine. The concerns centered on Book III of the &quot;Sentences&quot; where Peter Lombard discusses the hypostatic union from a variety of angles. The debate lingered long enough that the Pope reiterated his concerns in a second letter to William seven years later. The Pope&#x27;s position was not universally supported among the Cardinals who felt the Church faced more pressing issues.

After the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215, the &quot;Sentences&quot; became the standard textbook of theology at medieval universities. Stephen Langton&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Sentences&quot; helped establish the form. Until the 16th century, no work of Christian literature, except for the Bible itself, was commented upon more frequently. All the major medieval thinkers in western Europe relied on it, including Albert the Great, Alexander of Hales, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Marsilius of Inghen, William of Ockham, Petrus Aureolus, Robert Holcot, Duns Scotus, and Gabriel Biel.

Aquinas&#x27; &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot; would not eclipse the &quot;Sentences&quot; in importance until around the 16th century. Even the young Martin Luther still wrote glosses on the &quot;Sentences&quot;, and John Calvin quoted from it over 100 times in his &quot;Institutes&quot;.

David Luscombe called the &quot;Sentences&quot;, &quot;the least read of the world&#x27;s great books&quot;. In 1947, Friedrich Stegmüller compiled a 2-volume bibliography of commentaries on the &quot;Sentences&quot;. By 2001, the tally of Lombard commentators ran to 1,600 authors.

<text>Emily Pauline Johnson (10 March 1861 – 7 March 1913), also known by her Mohawk stage name Tekahionwake (pronounced &quot;dageh-eeon-wageh&quot;, ), was a Canadian poet, author, and performer who was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Her father was a hereditary Mohawk chief, and her mother was an English immigrant.

Johnson&#x27;s poetry was published in Canada, the United States, and Great Britain, and she was among a generation of widely read writers who began to define Canadian literature. She was a key figure in the construction of the field as an institution and has made an indelible mark on Indigenous women&#x27;s writing and performance as a whole.

Johnson was notable for her poems, short stories, and performances that celebrated her mixed-race heritage, drawing from both Indigenous and English influences. She is most known for her books of poetry &quot;The White Wampum&quot; (1895), &quot;Canadian Born&quot; (1903), and &quot;Flint and Feather&quot; (1912); and her collections of stories &quot;Legends of Vancouver&quot; (1911), &quot;The Shagganappi&quot; (1913), and &quot;The Moccasin Maker&quot; (1913). While her literary reputation declined after her death, since the late 20th century there has been a renewed interest in her life and works. In 2002, a complete collection of her known poetry was published, entitled &quot;E. Pauline Johnson, Tekahionwake: Collected Poems and Selected Prose&quot;.

== Family history ==
The Mohawk ancestors of Johnson&#x27;s father, Chief George Henry Martin Johnson, had historically lived in what became the state of New York, United States. Theirs was the easternmost territory in the homelands of the Five Nations of the Iroquois League (later the Six Nations), also known as the Haudenosaunee. Her great-grandfather Tekahionwake was born in 1758 in the province of New York. When he was baptized, he took the name Jacob Johnson. He was named after Sir William Johnson, the influential British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, who acted as his godfather. The Johnson surname was subsequently passed down in the family.

After the American Revolutionary War started, Loyalists in the Mohawk Valley came under intense pressure. The Mohawk and three other Haudenosaunee nations had allied with the British rather than the rebel colonists. Jacob Johnson and his family moved to Canada. After the war, they settled permanently in Ontario on land given by the Crown in partial compensation for Haudenosaunee losses of territory in New York.

His son John Smoke Johnson spoke English and Mohawk fluently and had a talent for oration. Due to his demonstrated patriotism to the Crown during the War of 1812, Smoke Johnson was made a Pine Tree Chief at the request of the British government. Although his title could not be inherited, his wife Helen Martin was a descendant of the Wolf Clan and a founding family of the Six Nations reserve. Through her lineage and influence (as the Mohawk had a matrilineal kinship system), their son George Johnson was named chief.
George Johnson inherited his father&#x27;s gift for languages and began his career as an Anglican Church missionary translator on the Six Nations reserve. Whilst working with the Anglican missionary assigned there, Johnson met the man&#x27;s sister-in-law, Emily Howells.

Emily Howells was born in Bristol, England, to a well-established British family who had immigrated to the United States in 1832. Her father, Henry Howells, was a Quaker and intended to join the American abolitionist movement. Emily&#x27;s mother, Mary Best Howells, died when the girl was five, when they were still in England. Her widowed father married again before they left for the US. In the US, he moved his family to several American cities, where he founded schools to gain an income, before settling in Eaglewood, New Jersey. After his second wife died (women had a high mortality in childbirth), Howells married a third time; he fathered a total of 24 children. He opposed slavery and encouraged his children to &quot;pray for the blacks and to pity the poor Indians&quot;. His compassion did not preclude his believing that his own race was superior to others.

At the age of 21, Emily Howells moved to the Six Nations reserve in Ontario, Canada, to join her older sister, who had moved there with her Anglican missionary husband. Emily helped her sister care for her growing family. After falling in love with George Johnson, Howells gained a better understanding of the Native peoples and some perspective on her father&#x27;s beliefs.

Much to the chagrin and displeasure of both their families, Johnson and Howells married in 1853. The birth of their first child reconciled the rift between their respective families. Several prominent Canadian families were descended from 18th- and 19th-century marriages between British fur traders, who had capital and social standing, and elite daughters of First Nations chiefs, in what were considered valuable economic and social alliances by both sides. Shortly after their marriage George became a chief of the Six Nations and was appointed as Crown interpreter for the Six Nations. In 1856 Johnson built Chiefswood, a wood mansion at his 225-acre estate. He and his family lived here for years at the Six Nations reserve outside Brantford, Ontario.

In his roles as government interpreter and hereditary chief, George Johnson developed a reputation as a talented mediator between Native and European interests. He was well respected in Ontario. He also made enemies because of his efforts to stop illegal trading of reserve timber. Physically attacked by Native and non-Native men involved in this and liquor traffic, Johnson suffered from severe health problems; he died of a fever in 1884.

== Personal life ==

=== Early life ===

E. Pauline Johnson was born at her family home Chiefswood at the Six Nations reserve outside Brantford, Ontario. She was the youngest of four children of Emily Susanna Howells Johnson (1824–1898), an English immigrant, and George Henry Martin Johnson (1816–1884), a Mohawk hereditary clan chief. Because George Johnson worked as an interpreter and cultural negotiator among the Mohawk, British, and representatives of the government of Canada, the Johnsons were seen as part of Canadian high society. They were visited by distinguished intellectual and political guests of the time, including The Marquess of Lorne, Princess Louise, Prince Arthur, inventor Alexander Graham Bell, painter Homer Watson, anthropologist Horatio Hale, and the third Governor General of Canada, Lord Dufferin.

Johnson&#x27;s mother emphasized refinement and decorum in raising her children, cultivating an &quot;aloof dignity&quot; that she felt would earn them respect in their adulthood. Pauline Johnson&#x27;s elegant manners and aristocratic air owed much to this background and training. George Johnson encouraged their four children to respect and learn about both their Mohawk and English heritage. Because George Johnson had partial Mohawk ancestry, his children were, by British law, legally considered Mohawk and wards of the British Crown. But, according to the Mohawk matrilineal kinship system, children are considered born into the mother&#x27;s family, and take their status from her. Thus the Johnson children were considered to belong to no Mohawk family or clan, and were excluded from important aspects of the tribe&#x27;s matrilineal culture.

=== Early education ===

A sickly child, Johnson did not attend Brantford&#x27;s Mohawk Institute, a residential school established in 1834. Her education was mostly at home and informal, derived from her mother, a series of non-Native governesses, a few years at the small school on the reserve, and self-guided reading in her family&#x27;s expansive library. She read deeply in the works of Byron, Tennyson, Keats, Browning and Milton, and enjoyed reading tales about Indigenous people such as Longfellow&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; and John Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Wacousta&quot;. These informed her own literary and theatrical work.

Despite growing up in a time when racism against Indigenous people was normalized and common, Johnson and her siblings were encouraged to appreciate their Mohawk ancestry and culture. Her paternal grandfather John Smoke Johnson was a respected authority figure for her and her siblings. He educated them by traditional Indigenous oral storytelling before his death in 1886. Johnson taught his life lessons and stories in Mohawk; the children understood it but were not fluent in speaking it. Smoke Johnson&#x27;s dramatic talents as a storyteller were absorbed by Pauline, who became known for her talent for elocution and her stage performances. She wore artifacts passed onto her by her Mohawk grandparents, such as a bear claw necklace, wampum belts, and various masks. Later in her life, Pauline Johnson expressed regret for not learning more of her grandfather&#x27;s Mohawk heritage and language.

At the age of 14, Johnson went to Brantford Central Collegiate with her brother Allen. She graduated in 1877. A fellow schoolmate was Sara Jeannette Duncan, who eventually developed her own journalistic and literary career.

=== Romantic life ===

Pauline Johnson attracted many potential suitors, and her sister recalled more than half a dozen marriage proposals from Euro-Canadians in her lifetime. Though the number of official romantic interests remains unknown, two later romances were identified as Charles R. L. Drayton in 1890 and Charles Wuerz in 1900. But, Johnson never married nor remained in relationships for very long. She was said to have flirted with boys in Grand River. Later she wrote what was described as &quot;intensely erotic poetry.&quot; Due to her career, she was unwilling to set aside her racial heritage and adapt to placate partners or in-laws. Despite everything, Johnson consistently had a strong network of supportive female friends and attested to the importance they had in her life.

Johnson said:
== Stage career ==
During the 1880s, Johnson wrote and performed in amateur theatre productions. She enjoyed the Canadian outdoors, where she travelled by canoe. Shortly after her father&#x27;s death in 1884, the family rented out Chiefswood. Johnson moved with her widowed mother and sister to a modest home in Brantford. She worked to support them all, and found that her stage performances enabled her to make a living. Johnson supported her mother until her death in 1898.

The Young Men&#x27;s Liberal Association invited Johnson to a Canadian authors evening in 1892 at the Toronto Art School Gallery. The only woman at the event, she read to an overflow crowd, along with poets including William Douw Lighthall, William Wilfred Campbell, and Duncan Campbell Scott. &quot;The poise and grace of this beautiful young woman standing before them captivated the audience even before she began to recite—not read, as the others had done&quot;—her &quot;Cry from an Indian Wife&quot;. She was the only author to be called back for an encore. &quot;She had scored a personal triumph and saved the evening from turning into a disaster.&quot; The success of this performance began the poet&#x27;s 15-year stage career.

Johnson was signed up by Frank Yeigh, who had organized the Liberal event. He gave her the headline for her first show on 19 February 1892, where she made her debut with a new poem written for the event, &quot;The Song My Paddle Sings&quot;.

At 31 years old, Johnson was perceived as a young and exotic Native beauty. After her first recital season, she decided to emphasize the Native aspects of her public persona in her theatrical performances. Johnson created a two-part act that would confound the dichotomy of her European and Indigenous background. In act one, Johnson would come out as &quot;Tekahionwake,&quot; the Mohawk name of her great-grandfather, wearing a costume that served as a pastiche and assemblage of generic &quot;Indian&quot; objects that did not belong to one individual nation. But, her costume from 1892 to 1895 included items she had received from Mohawk and other sources, such as scalps inherited from her grandfather that hung from her wampum belt, spiritual masks, and other paraphernalia. During this act she would recite dramatic &quot;Indian&quot; lyrics.

At intermission, she changed into fashionable English dress. In act two, she came out as a pro-North West Mounted Police (now known as the RCMP) Victorian English woman to recite her &quot;English&quot; verse. Many of the items on her native dress were sold to museums such as the Ontario Provincial Museum, or to collectors such as the prominent American George Gustav Heye. Upon her death she willed her &quot;Indian&quot; costume to the Museum of Vancouver.

There are many interpretations of Johnson&#x27;s performances. The artist is quoted saying &quot;I may act till the world grows wild and tense&quot;. Her shows were tremendously popular. She toured all across North America with her friend and fellow performer, and later business manager, Walter MacRaye. Her popularity was part of the immense interest by European Americans and Europeans in Indigenous peoples throughout the 19th century; the 1890s were also the period of popularity of &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; show and ethnological aboriginal exhibits.

== Literary career ==

In 1883 Johnson published her first full-length poem, &quot;My Little Jean&quot;, in the New York magazine &quot;Gems of Poetry&quot;. She began to increase the pace of her writing and publishing afterwards.

In 1885, poet Charles G. D. Roberts published Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A Cry from an Indian Wife&quot; in &quot;The Week&quot;, Goldwin Smith&#x27;s Toronto magazine. She based it on events of the battle of Cut Knife Creek during the Riel Rebellion. Roberts and Johnson became lifelong friends. Johnson promoted her identity as a Mohawk, but as an adult spent little time with people of that culture. In 1885, Johnson travelled to Buffalo, New York, to attend a ceremony honouring the Haudenosaunee leader &quot;Sagoyewatha,&quot; also known as Red Jacket. She wrote a poem expressing admiration for him and a plea for reconciliation between British and Native peoples.

In 1886, Johnson was commissioned to write a poem to mark the unveiling in Brantford of a statue honouring Joseph Brant, the important Mohawk leader who was allied with the British during and after the American Revolutionary War. Her &quot;Ode to Brant&quot; was read at a 13 October ceremony before &quot;the largest crowd the little city had ever seen&quot;. It called for brotherhood between Native and white Canadians under British imperial authority. The poem sparked a long article in the Toronto &quot;Globe&quot;, and increased interest in Johnson&#x27;s poetry and heritage. The Brantford businessman William Foster Cockshutt read the poem at the ceremony, as Johnson was reportedly too shy.

During the 1880s, Johnson built her reputation as a Canadian writer, regularly publishing in periodicals such as &quot;Globe&quot;, &quot;The Week&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. In the late 1880s and early 1890s, she published nearly every month, mostly in &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Johnson is considered among a group of Canadian authors who were contributing to a distinct national literature. The inclusion of two of her poems in W. D. Lighthall&#x27;s anthology, &quot;Songs of the Great Dominion&quot; (1889), signalled her recognition. Theodore Watts-Dunton noted her for praise in his review of the book; he quoted her entire poem &quot;In the Shadows&quot; and called her &quot;the most interesting poetess now living&quot;. In her early works, Johnson wrote mostly about Canadian life, landscapes, and love in a post-Romantic mode, reflective of literary interests shared with her mother, rather than her Mohawk heritage.

After retiring from the stage in August 1909, Johnson moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where she continued writing. Her pieces included a series of articles for the &quot;Daily Province&quot;, based on stories related by her friend Chief Joe Capilano of the Squamish people of North Vancouver. In 1911, to help support Johnson, who was ill and poor, a group of friends organized the publication of these stories under the title &quot;Legends of Vancouver&quot;. They remain classics of that city&#x27;s literature.

One of the stories was a Squamish legend of shape shifting: how a man was transformed into Siwash Rock &quot;as an indestructible monument to Clean Fatherhood&quot;. In another, Johnson told the history of Deadman&#x27;s Island, a small islet off Stanley Park. In a poem in the collection, she named one of her favourite areas &quot;Lost Lagoon&quot;, as the inlet seemed to disappear when the water emptied at low tide. The body of water has since been transformed into a permanent, fresh-water lake at Stanley Park, but it is still called Lost Lagoon.

Johnson drew on her mixed ethnic background and cultural heritages as a major theme in her work. The heroine of her short story &quot;The De Lisle Affair&quot; (1897), was disguised. Readers were discomforted due to the uncertainty of appearances, particularly amongst women. Due to their subordinated social, economic, and political positions, women often had to play the roles as mediators for men, practising ambiguity and disloyalty for the sake of their safety and sanctity. The notion of shifting identity is seen in &quot;The Ballad of Yaada&quot; (1913), where a female character explains &quot;not to friend – but unto foeman I belong ... though you hate, / I still must love him,&quot; which suggests the potential for communities to understand one another through love and kindness. But she also explores the risk of the coming together of communities and cultures. Johnson&#x27;s mixed-race heroine Esther, in &quot;As It Was in the Beginning&quot;, kills her unfaithful White lover. With the words &quot;I am a Redskin, but I am something else, too – I am a woman&quot;, Esther is demanding recognition of multiple subjectivities. Johnson was trying to convey that the real world consists of much more than oppressive ideologies and artificial divisions of race and nation enforced by authoritative figures such as the racist Protestant minister in this story, revealingly nicknamed &quot;St Paul&quot; after the biblical misogynist.

The posthumous &quot;Shagganappi&quot; (1913) and &quot;The Moccasin Maker&quot; (1913) are collections of selected stories first published in periodicals. Johnson wrote on a variety of sentimental, didactic, and biographical topics. Veronica Strong-Boag and Carole Gerson provided a provisional chronological list of Johnson&#x27;s writings in their book &quot;Paddling Her Own Canoe: The Times and Texts of E. Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake)&quot; (2000).

== Death ==

Johnson died of breast cancer on 7 March 1913 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Devotion to her persisted after her death. Her funeral was held on what would have been her 52nd birthday. It was the largest public funeral in Vancouver history to that time. The city closed its offices and flew flags at half-mast; a memorial service was held in Vancouver&#x27;s most prestigious church, the Anglican cathedral supervised by the Women&#x27;s Canadian Club. Squamish people also lined the streets and followed her funeral cortege on 10 March 1913. The Vancouver &quot;Province&quot; headline on the day of her funeral said, &quot;Canada&#x27;s poetess is laid to rest&quot;. Smaller memorial services were also held in Brantford, Ontario, organized by Euro-Canadian admirers.

Johnson&#x27;s ashes were placed in Stanley Park near Siwash Rock, through the special intervention of the governor general, the Duke of Connaught, who had visited during her final illness, and Sam Hughes, the minister of militia.
Her will was prepared by the prestigious firm of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, son of the former 6th prime minister of Canada. Despite Johnson&#x27;s preference for an unmarked grave, the Women&#x27;s Canadian Club sought to raise money for a monument for her. In 1922, a cairn was erected at her burial site with the inscription stating, in part, &quot;In memory of one whose life and writings were an uplift and a blessing to our nation&quot;. During World War One, part of the royalties from &quot;Legends of Vancouver&quot; went to purchase a machine gun inscribed &quot;Tekahionwake&quot; for the 29th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Johnson left a mark on Canadian history that has carried on long after her death.

== Reception ==
Scholars have had difficulty identifying Johnson&#x27;s complete works, as much was published in periodicals. Her first volume of poetry, &quot;The White Wampum&quot;, was published in London in 1895. It was followed by &quot;Canadian Born&quot; in 1903. The contents of these volumes, together with additional poems, were published as the collection &quot;Flint and Feather&quot; in 1912. Reprinted many times, this book has been one of the best-selling titles of Canadian poetry. Since the 1917 edition, &quot;Flint and Feather&quot; has been misleadingly subtitled &quot;The Complete Poems of E. Pauline Johnson&quot;.

But in 2002, professors Carole Gerson and Veronica Strong-Boag produced an edition, &quot;Tekahionwake: Collected Poems and Selected Prose&quot;, that contains all of Johnson&#x27;s poems found up to that date. A number of biographers and literary critics have downplayed her literary contributions, as they contend that her performances contributed most to her literary reputation during her lifetime. W. J. Keith wrote: &quot;Pauline Johnson&#x27;s life was more interesting than her writing ... with ambitions as a poet, she produced little or nothing of value in the eyes of critics who emphasize style rather than content.&quot;

Despite the acclaim she received from contemporaries, Johnson had a decline in reputation in the decades after her death. It was not until 1961, with commemoration of the centenary of her birth, that Johnson began to be recognized as an important Canadian cultural figure. This was also the beginning of a period when the writing of women and First Nations people began to be re-evaluated and recognized.

Canadian author Margaret Atwood admitted that she did not study literature by Native authors when preparing &quot;&quot; (1972), her seminal work. At its publication, she had said she could not find Native works. She mused, &quot;Why did I overlook Pauline Johnson? Perhaps because, being half-white, she somehow didn&#x27;t rate as the real thing, even among Natives; although she is undergoing reclamation today.&quot; Atwood&#x27;s comments indicated that Johnson&#x27;s multicultural identity contributed to her neglect by critics.

As Atwood noted, since the late 20th century, Johnson&#x27;s writings and performance career have been reevaluated by literary, feminist, and postcolonial critics. They have appreciated her importance as a New Woman and a figure of resistance to dominant ideas about race, gender, Native Rights, and Canada. The growth in literature written by First Nations people during the 1980s and 1990s has also prompted writers and scholars to investigate Native oral and written literary history, to which Johnson made a significant contribution.

E. Pauline Johnson has received much less attention than one might expect for an accomplished and controversial literary figure. Older critics often dismissed Johnson&#x27;s work; in 1988 critic Charles Lillard characterized her readers dismissively as &quot;tourists, grandmothers ... and the curious&quot;. In 1992, a &quot;Specialized Catalogue of Canadian Stamps&quot;, issued by Canada Post misrepresented Johnson as a &quot;Mohawk Princess&quot;, ignoring her scholarly accomplishments. And in 1999 Patrick Watson introduced the History Channel&#x27;s biography of Johnson by deprecating &quot;The Song My Paddle Sings&quot;. Even in regard to scholarship, Johnson was often overlooked in the 1980s in favour of Duncan Campbell Scott for writing about indigenous life, although he was Euro-Canadian. But a new generation of feminist scholars has begun to counter narratives of Canadian literary history and Johnson is being recognised for her literary efforts.

An examination of the reception of Johnson&#x27;s writing over the course of a century provides an opportunity to study changing notions of literary value, and the shifting demarcation between high and popular culture. During her lifetime, this line scarcely existed in Canada, where nationalism prevailed as the primary evaluative criterion. The Vancouver &quot;Province&quot; headline on the day of her funeral in March 1913 simply stated, &quot;Canada&#x27;s poetess is laid to rest&quot;. During the following decade, an &quot;elegiac quality often imbued references to Pauline Johnson&quot;. To Euro-Canadians, she was considered the last spokesperson for a people destined to disappear: &quot;The time must come for us to go down, and when it comes may we have the strength to meet our fate with such fortitude and silent dignity as did the Red Man his.&quot;

Johnson is capable of remarkably clear dissections of the racist habits of the time, a clarity that comes out of her standpoint as a privileged Mohawk educated in both Haudenosaunee society and white Anglo-Canadian culture. Her deft use of analogues between Iroquois traditions of government and religion and those of the dominant culture, works to show the Six Nations to be as politically responsible as, and far less sexist than, the British; the one God of the Longhouse to be more benign than the Christian God; and Iroquois traditions to be more time-tested, healthy, and virtuous than those of a corrupted urban modernity. However, her patriotic enthusiasm for Canada and the Crown, as expressed in &quot;Canadian Born&quot; and elsewhere, seems at odds with her Indigenous advocacy.

In the 21st century, some have questioned the moral ambiguity of Johnson&#x27;s work and whether she herself was racist. In 2017 school administrators at the High Park Alternative Public School in Toronto characterized the song &quot;Land of the Silver Birch&quot; as racist, mistakenly asserting that Johnson wrote the poem on which the song is based. In a letter to parents, they said, &quot;While its lyrics are not overtly racist ... the historical context of the song is racist.&quot; Some experts disagreed with this assertion, and the music teacher, who arranged for the song to be performed at a school concert, sued the administration for defamation.

== Legacy ==
=== Canadian literature ===
A 1997 survey by Hartmut Lutz of the state of Canadian Native Literature in the 1960s, pointed to the importance of this era as establishing the foundation for the new wave of Indigenous writing that surged in the 1980s and 1990s. Lutz identified &quot;1967 as the beginning of contemporary writing by Native authors in Canada&quot;, marking the publication of George Clutesi&#x27;s landmark work, &quot;Son of Raven, Son of Deer&quot;. His discussion briefly mentioned Johnson but he did not acknowledge that 1961 marked the centennial of Johnson&#x27;s birth; the resulting celebration nationally demonstrated the endurance of her prominence in Indigenous and Canadian literature and popular culture.

As a writer and performer, Johnson was a central figure in literary and performance history of Indigenous women in Canada. Of her importance, Mohawk writer Beth Brant wrote &quot;Pauline Johnson&#x27;s physical body died in 1913, but her spirit still communicates to us who are Native women writers. She walked the writing path clearing the brush for us to follow.&quot;

Johnson influence over other female Indigenous Canadian writers was expressed by their references to her throughout various decades, for example:

* 1989 - Poet Joan Crate (Metis) referred to Johnson in the title of her book of poetry &quot;Pale as Real Ladies: Poems for Pauline Johnson&quot;.
* 2000 - Jeannette Armstrong (Okanagan) opened her novel &quot;Whispering in Shadows&quot; with Johnson&#x27;s poem &quot;Moonset&quot;.
* 2002 - Poet Janet Rogers (Mohawk) published her play &quot;Pauline and Emily, Two Women&quot;, recasting Johnson as a friend and interlocutor of Canadian artist Emily Carr, who often painted Indigenous life as decayed and dying.
* 1993 - Shelley Niro (Mohawk) made a film, &quot;It Starts With a Whisper&quot;, that includes a reading of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Song My Paddle Sings&quot;.

Broadcaster Rosanna Deerchild (Cree) remembers stumbling across &quot;The Cattle Thief&quot; in the public library: &quot;I hand-copied that entire poem right then and there and carried it around with me, reading it over and over.&quot; Later she wrote a poem about Johnson entitled &quot;she writes us alive.&quot; There are numerous other examples of contemporary Indigenous artists, women and men alike, who were inspired by Johnson, notably within Canadian literature.

=== Canadian government ===
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, government policies towards Indigenous Canadians were increasingly cruel. Across the continent, Indigenous children were forcibly removed to residential schools; on the Prairies, communities such as the Dogrib, Cree and Blackfoot were confined to artificial reserves; settler attitudes towards the Dominion&#x27;s original inhabitants curdled and hardened. Johnson critiqued some Canadian policies that resulted in such legalized and justified mistreatment of Indigenous peoples. For example, in her poem &quot;A Cry From an Indian Wife&quot;, the final verse reads:

Because of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; and faulty scientific blood quantum racial determinism, Johnson was often belittled by the term &quot;halfbreed&quot;.

<text>S4C Dau (, meaning &quot;Channel Four Wales Two&quot;, formerly branded S4C2) was a free-to-air British television station owned by S4C which, until 2010, broadcast coverage of the Senedd at the Senedd building. It was also used for extended coverage of events shown on the main S4C service, such as the National Eisteddfod of Wales and Royal Welsh Show.

==History==
===Launch===
When the UK government was planning digital terrestrial television in the late 1990s, each of the existing analogue broadcasters were allocated half a multiplex of capacity each. Each multiplex has capacity to carry multiple television stations. As one of the existing analogue broadcasters, S4C were allocated half of multiplex A and decided to use their gifted capacity to broadcast two stations in Wales; &quot;S4C Digidol&quot;, a partial simulcast of their analogue television station and &quot;S4C2&quot;, a new service. Outside of Wales, they opted to sell their capacity to pay-TV broadcaster ONdigital to use for their service, meaning that S4C2 was only broadcast from transmitters located within Wales.
The channel launched on 15 September 1999 as a free-to-air channel on the ONdigital platform using S4C&#x27;s gifted capacity on multiplex A, and later Sky and NTL. It formed part of the Freeview service and cable throughout Wales, but was available throughout the United Kingdom on Freesat and Sky.

The channel initially broadcast all proceedings from the National Assembly for Wales, live and uninterrupted. As the Assembly is bilingual, with members allowed to speak in either English or Welsh, the service carried two audio feeds on Freeview and satellite; an untranslated feed that broadcast proceedings in their original language (be it English or Welsh) and an English feed where any Welsh speech was voiced-over live into English. The channel was described by S4C as a &#x27;unique partnership&#x27; between themselves as the broadcaster and BBC Cymru Wales as the service provider. As such, the costs of producing the Assembly output were funded by BBC Wales, while the costs of distribution were met by S4C. S4C did not receive additional funding from the government to cover the costs of running the service, and couldn&#x27;t divert public money intended to fund content for its main channel, as S4C2 was neither classed as a public service channel, nor was there any obligation for S4C to run such a service. As such, S4C&#x27;s costs for the channel was funded from commercial revenues and the channel itself was operated through a commercial subsidiary of S4C, S4C2 Ltd., who held the broadcast licence.

S4C2 was also used for interactive programming and alternate programming that couldn&#x27;t be aired on the main S4C channel, such as uninterrupted coverage of competitions from the , the Urdd National Eisteddfod, the Royal Welsh Show and &#x27;s sing-along feature (&quot;Best of Song for Wales&quot;, a yearly Welsh music competition).

On 18 January 2007, as part of a rebrand of S4C&#x27;s services, S4C2&#x27;s logo was changed, with the channel now identified as &quot;S4C Dau/S4C Two&quot;.

===Removal of Assembly coverage===
As part a consultation into provision of a new children&#x27;s service in 2007, S4C identified that there was a large amount of capacity being unused by the S4C2 service when the Assembly was not in session. They suggested two proposals they considered viable, one of which would see the children&#x27;s service operate in the downtime around the Assembly coverage, while the other would see the Assembly coverage removed altogether and S4C2 changed into a full-time children&#x27;s channel.

From January 2010, coverage of the National Assembly for Wales proceedings ceased on the channel. This programming was produced by the BBC and was made available online via the Democracy Live section of the BBC&#x27;s website.

In March 2010, the broadcaster announced it would resume broadcasts of the Assembly&#x27;s full sessions and some committees in a new thrice-weekly overnight programme entitled &quot;Y Dydd yn Y Cynulliad&quot; (&quot;The Day in the Assembly&quot;) on its main S4C service from Tuesday 20 April 2010.

===Closure===
On 16 September 2010, S4C2 was removed from Sky channel 507. It was also removed from Virgin Media channel 168 during October and Freeview channel 86 on 30 November 2010, in both cases the channel was only available in Wales. The channel finally ceased broadcasting on 6 December 2010, when it was removed from Freesat. S4C confirmed the channel&#x27;s closure in January 2011, where they said its live coverage from the National Eisteddfod and Royal Welsh show would be more heavily featured on the main S4C channel, whilst recorded coverage of the Assembly would continue to be broadcast on the main channel in its late night slot. S4C cited budget cuts from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) as the reason for closing the service. As part of the UK Government spending review announced in October 2010, S4C&#x27;s budget was to be cut by 25% by 2015.

<doc id="611596" wikidata="Q14935059" url="?curid=611596" title="Arthurs Seat, Victoria">
<text>Arthurs Seat is a mountainous and small locality on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, about 85 km south east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Arthurs Seat recorded a population of 414 at the 2021 census.

Arthurs Seat is noted for its exclusivity and the general affluence of the demographics which make up the enclave. The Aboriginal Boonwurrung name for the hill is Wonga.

It is a major tourist destination, with stately homes, and due to its natural bushland, sweeping views and man-made attractions. The hill rises to above sea level.

The underlying rocks are Devonian granite, bounded to the west by the Selwyn Fault. The vegetation consists of dry open forest of mixed eucalypt species, which was extensively burnt during a bushfire in 1973 and again in 1997. The indigenous vegetation on the north-west face has been heavily infested with noxious weed and much of the natural vegetation has been cleared away, although several large stands still remain.

==History==

&quot;Wonga&quot; was home to the Boonwurrung prior to European settlement. The lower slopes of the hill were known as &quot;Wango&quot;, and were a place where corroborees were held. Three Boonwurrung names have been recorded for this hill: &quot;Momo&quot;, &quot;Wonga&quot; and &quot;Tubberrubberbil&quot;, though the latter is possibly confused with Tubba Rubba creek.

The term Arthurs Seat was first applied to the mountain range, then to a squatting run, next to the pre-emptive right, then to land allotments in the area that is now the suburb McCrae, and currently to the suburb at the summit of the range.

It was named by Acting Lieutenant John Murray when he entered Port Phillip in in February 1802, for an apparent resemblance to the hill of Arthur&#x27;s Seat in Edinburgh (which was his home city).

Captain Matthew Flinders climbed Arthurs Seat on 27 April 1802, noting in his log &quot;The Bluff Mountain on the eastward I estimated at over 1000 feet high, and being near the waterside, possessed a favourable station for observation purposes. I ascend the hill and took an extensive set of bearings from the cleared place to be found on the north western bluff part of the hill.&quot; Another notable ascent was in 1844 when Sir John Franklin (former Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land) climbed Arthurs seat with Andrew McCrae (then owner of the McCrae homestead at the foot).

It was not until 1853 that a structure was placed on the summit, a trigonometrical station, for survey purposes. The station was burnt down in 1880. In 1883 a new lighthouse was assembled in McCrae making the previously wooden structure redundant, so authorities decided to transport the wooden frame by bullock wagon to the summit for use as a lookout tower where it remained until 1934 when it was again replaced by another tower.

In 1913 the Flinders Shire Council cut and formed a track for vehicles to the summit. In 1929 the track was re-surveyed, widened, reconstructed and continued to link up with Dromana-Flinders Road
The summit area of Arthurs Seat was not recognised as separate of Dromana/McCrae until it was subdivided by council in 1930. before this recognition the summit area as we know it today was titled &quot;Dromana park&quot; or &quot;Arthurs Seat Range&quot; in the southern area of subdivision survey maps from mid to late 1800s displaying the country lands in the parish of Kangerong (now Dromana)
The Garden of the Moon opened in 1931 and has brought tourism to the location from the very beginnings of its establishment. It offered attractions such as a dance hall, camera obscura, telescopes, swimming pool, fish-pond, hexagonal kiosk and wishing well. The lookout tower opened in 1934. The 950m long chairlift route was built in 1960. This added to the already well-established tourist attraction, with an estimated 100,000 chairlift users in 2002 according to the Mornington Peninsula Tourism Council. In the 1970s, efforts were made to build a quarry in the area but were blocked by a green ban.

Tourism at the summit has been in decline since both the closure of the chairlift in 2006 and the closure and subsequent removal of the lookout tower in 2012. Chief executive Mark Stone of Parks Victoria called for &quot;new modern infrastructure&quot; in 2009 Development of new infrastructure was disputed and subsequently assessed at a VCAT hearing, VCAT allowing the application despite strong local concern put forward by &quot;Save Our Seat&quot;.

==Present day==

Current attractions at Arthurs Seat include Arthurs Seat State Park (including &quot;Seawinds&quot; gardens), a maze, two restaurants and a car museum. The viewing area near the summit has disrupted views of Port Phillip with the Melbourne City skyline and the You Yangs visible on the horizon on a clear day from some of the lookouts.

The summit is connected to nearby Dromana by a winding tourist road which opened in 1929. The road provides access to the Dromana cemetery on the way to the summit. This hill climb in the past was used for the historic fathers day hill climb, Local governance has allowed the loss of this not for profit community event to make way for commercial events like bicycle races. Prominent viewpoints from the road include Bowens Point (145 m), Franklin Point (195 m), Murrays Lookout (247m), and Chapmans Point (274 m), Due to overgrowth at the higher Chapmans point, Murrays lookout is the best vantage point to view the peninsula itself.
Due to frequent vandalism the higher view points have had their Carved wooden signage (seen in photo) replaced by smaller metal signage in an attempt to lower maintenance.

Resistance from local action groups have stalled multiple projects planned for the summit,
putting pressure on existing tourism operations that have been closing and moving interstate to seek more supportive community conditions.
The current occupation of housing is reflective of the locations original intention as a holiday destination with 40% of private dwellings listed as unoccupied.

===Walking tracks===
Arthurs Seat boasts an expansive network of marked and unmarked walking tracks. The large number of bush tracks and open bushland can make navigating the officially marked tracks confusing at times.

====Two Bays walking track====
The Two Bays walking track runs the length of Arthurs seat state park from Bunurong Track to Waterfall Gully Road.
The entire track runs from Dromana to Cape Schanck and is the longest continuous track on the Mornington Peninsula. It was first proposed as a part of celebrating Victoria&#x27;s 150th Celebrations.
Parks Victoria does not recommend visitors attempt the entire track in a single visit, but to instead attempt smaller sections of the walk such as the Arthurs Seat section.

====Kings Falls Track &amp; Circuit Walk====

The Kings Falls Track &amp; Circuit Walk is a picturesque walk suitable for most levels of walker. The Kings Falls Circuit walk starts at the car park on Waterfall Gully Road. Initially, the walk is along a dirt track but this changes in some places to a boardwalk with steps making it easy on the steeper sections. There is a lookout with a view across the valley where the waterfall is visible about 250 metres along the path.

====TC McKeller Circuit Walk====

====Cook Street track====

===Sea Winds===
Sea winds Gardens is a featured section of the park near the summit maintained by Parks Victoria and volunteers.
Access to Sea Winds is via Purves Road a short distance from the summit.
Seawinds Gardens encompasses a 34 hectare area at the Summit of Arthurs Seat, 305 metres above sea level. The gardens have views of Port Phillip Bay and the Mornington and Bellarine Peninsulas from the Bay and Northern Lookouts.
The combination of indigenous and exotic formal gardens typifies the area.

A network of walking tracks guide visitors through a diverse range of exotic and indigenous gardens. The gardens are used for picnics - with tables, electric BBQs and toilets available adjacent to the car park. Disabled access is available to facilities and walking tracks.

===Arthurs Seat Chairlift===
====Construction and history====

A chairlift at Arthurs Seat was built by Czech-born engineer Vladimir Hájek and opened on 21 December 1960.

As a Melbourne tourist attraction, thanks to the views over Port Phillip Bay and beyond, the lift rose 225m over nearly one kilometre and operated for more than 40 years under two owners, Dr Hájek and Richard Hudson, before being closed after several safety incidents in 2006.

After being closed for a number of years, the chairlift was removed and has now been replaced by a modern Doppelmayr ride called the Arthurs Seat Eagle.

====Safety incidents and closure====

On 3 January 2003, a pylon tower supporting the chairlift collapsed, injuring 18. A subsequent investigation found water had got between the pylon and the concrete base and caused bolts to rust. The chairlift had met the standards required at that time. Safety and testing requirements were subsequently strengthened by the Victorian Government.

After the owner spent $500,000 on extensive repairs, the chairlift reopened a year later, but on 18 March 2004 a second incident occurred when a chair came loose and a 77-year-old woman suffered two broken legs. 
A WorkSafe Victoria Prohibition Notice effectively closed the ride until further safety improvements were made. The chairlift resumed operations in October 2004.

The owner was charged by WorkSafe under section 22 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act over the 2004 incident. After pleading guilty to failing to carry out adequate maintenance, the company was convicted and fined $110,000 in October 2007.
This fine was later reduced to $60,000 on appeal.

On 16 May 2006 a mechanical failure stranded, but did not injure, about 12 tourists on the chairlift and resulted in further media attention. In August 2008 the company pleaded guilty to failing to take care of the safety of non-employees. It was not convicted, but ordered to pay $15,000 in costs and ordered to carry out a safety improvement project. This involved a range of works to bring it into line with Canadian chairlift standard Standards Council of Canada Z-98, an audit of safety before it could re-open, and three-monthly reports on compliance with Z-98 for two years. The operator closed the chairlift with a view to move the operation to Mt Lofty on Adelaide&#x27;s fringe, however this project did not reach fruition.

====The search for a new chairlift====
In October 2009 Parks Victoria began looking for an operator to design, build, run and maintain a new chairlift. After some delay, Arthurs Seat Skylift Pty Ltd took on the site and submitted proposals for a larger scale development incorporating all-weather gondolas, allowing a more comfortable all-year rides which was not possible in the past.

By early 2013, the old chairlift&#x27;s pylons were removed and the top station was demolished. The Arthurs Seat lookout tower was also demolished after many years of being unsafe to operate due to concrete cancer.

In June 2014 Mornington Shire Council approved the plans for the new chairlift in a 5/4 vote.
There were 22 letters of support from groups such as,
The National Trust;
Puffing Billy;
Phillip Island Nature Reserve;
Tourism Victoria;
Victorian Tourism Industry Council;
Western Port Tourism Inc.;
Tourism &amp; Transport Forum Australia;

A group of local residents objected and unsuccessfully appealed against the council&#x27;s decision at VCAT.

In April 2016, the Victorian Government revoked the council&#x27;s authority to oversee the project. This followed the council&#x27;s unusual decision to remove the standard delegation to its executive to handle minor consent matters during construction.

Construction work for the new chair lift and associated upper and lower complexes began in October 2015. The new chairlift started carrying passengers in December 2016.

<text>Balnarring is a town in the south-eastern extremity of the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, approximately south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Balnarring recorded a population of 2,371 at the 2021 census.

Balnarring is located about halfway between Hastings and Flinders.

==History==

Early reports of the area suggested the region was &quot;thick with honeysuckle and sheoak&quot;, and that the area from Somers to Point Leo contained &quot;good soil, good grass, and open forest timbered with Gums wattle and She Oak trees&quot;. Early settlers were involved in wattle bark stripping and cutting piles and sleepers for shipping to Melbourne via Shoreham to the southwest.

From 1857 onwards, the Government enacted a series of Land Acts designed to open the land, dividing it into small blocks and hoping to create a living for small-scale farmers. The Parish of Balnarring was surveyed in 1865, as part of the &quot;Agricultural Area of Mount McMahon&quot;. Most of the selectors were orchardists although dairymen also took an interest in the area. In the 1920s, the construction of cool stores at Red Hill increased their ability to trade their produce with the outside world.

In 1866, a post office opened, and a school shortly afterwards, and in 1869, an inn and store called the Tower Hotel operated by the Van Suylens on their property, &quot;Warrawee&quot;, was established to serve local residents on the Frankston-Flinders road. This and the Sandy Point Road had already been established as tracks, as indicated on an 1874 map of the area. An 1891 map shows a blacksmith&#x27;s store where the panel beaters operation presently stands at this intersection.

A writer in 1902 described Balnarring as a &quot;little wayside hamlet on the road between Hastings and Flinders...probably one of the least pretentious in the state. It consists chiefly of a state school, but there are a few buildings within sight of the main road&quot;. In 1962, the Victorian Municipal Directory stated Balnarring had a &quot;post and telegraph office, two churches, mechanics&#x27; institute and library&quot;.

The railway station in Balnarring opened on 2 December 1921 but, like its Red Hill branch line, was relatively short-lived, officially closing on 29 June 1953. However, it was kept in service for annual local events until about 10 years after the closure.

On 23 August 1899, the Balnarring Mechanics&#x27; Institute was opened by the Hon. F.S. Grimwade (MLC North Yarra, 1891–1904). It was a timber hall, used as a community hall and social centre by the community until the 1960s. A new hall was built in 1969. In 1970 the Mechanics&#x27; Institute building burned down, and in 1979 a reserve was declared in its original location.

==Present day==

Balnarring is at the crossroads of two primary main roads in the south-eastern region of the Mornington Peninsula, namely Frankston-Flinders Road and Balnarring Road (from Mornington), and as a result is home to a few motels, a post office and several shops and cafes. It also has a primary school, Balnarring Primary School.

Balnarring has a picnic horse racing club, the Balnarring Picnic Racing Club (established in 1863), which schedules around six race meetings a year including the
Balnarring Cup meeting on Australia Day (26 January) at the Emu Plains racecourse and recreation reserve.

The Emu Plains Market which operates monthly in summer at the same location is very popular with locals and tourists.

Balnarring is served by the 782 bus route operated by Ventura Bus Lines between Frankston and Flinders.

<text>Balnarring Beach is a town on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south of Balnarring and approximately south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Balnarring Beach recorded a population of 471 at the 2021 census.

In 2006 it was rated by the Keep Australia Beautiful Council as &#x27;Australia&#x27;s Cleanest Beach&#x27;, out of 317 beaches in five states.

It was previously known as Tulum Beach.

==History==

The township was first gazetted in 1886, in a street configuration quite different to what exists today.

The beach first began to attract holidaymakers in the 1910s, and beach stores and kiosks commenced operations, serving both day-trippers and campers. The Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Club set up base here after their formation in 1924. During World War II, businesses were sustained by servicemen training at Somers.

In 1944, a mobile library operated from a private home for the Flinders Shire by Wally Turner. Balnarring Beach Post Office opened on 1 July 1947 and closed in 1978.
In 1960 the yacht club was given permission to erect a winch and slipway and build a clubhouse.

==Present day==

Balnarring Beach (colloquially known as &#x27;The Naz Beach&#x27;) today consists primarily of holiday homes and camping grounds, and contains a general store, picnic facilities and several caravan parks. Most other services are provided by nearby Balnarring township.

<text>Baxter is a surburb in the Shire of Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia, located south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District. Baxter recorded a population of 2,166 at the 2021 census.

It is served by Baxter railway station on the Stony Point greater-metropolitan line.

Originally named Baxter&#x27;s Flat, Baxter was founded by pastoralist Benjamin Baxter, who lived in a property named &quot;Carrup Carrup&quot; - the Aboriginal name. The property still exists today on what is now the Frankston-Flinders Road, as does the original cottage he and his wife Martha lived in. Benjamin Baxter died in 1892 and his gravestone, found in the Frankston Cemetery, reads &quot;Benjamin Baxter, late of h. m. 50th regiment. Died at Currup Currup 15 May 1892, aged 87. Also Martha, beloved wife of above 31 January 1906 age 94 years&quot;.

It was at Baxter&#x27;s Flat that the railway to Mornington and Stony Point (built in the late 1880s) separated. The station was called Mornington Junction before being changed to Baxter, however its role as a junction ended in the 1980s with the closure of the Mornington line.

The early township grew around the railway station and a Post Office named Mornington Junction opened on 1 December 1892 (Baxter from 1918) 

Other historic cottages in the area include a primitive 1850s homestead called Eurutta (formerly Sage&#x27;s Cottage), and a 1920s American-style residence called Mulberry Hill.

Baxter Primary School was established in 1890.

==Sport==

Baxter Soccer Club has been around for many years and compete in the Football Victoria leagues. Their home ground is located at Baxter Park.

Mornington Peninsula Pony Club provides dressage, show jumping and cross-country facilities for young equestrian enthusiasts. The club holds its rallies each month at Baxter Park and is affiliated with the Pony Club Association of Victoria.

<text>Blairgowrie is a seaside suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, approximately south of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Blairgowrie recorded population of 2,786 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Blairgowrie was named after the Burgh of Blairgowrie, the largest town in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. A post office was not opened until 1 November 1947.

Rhys Isaac, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, died in Blairgowrie in October 2010.

==Present day==

Blairgowrie is located near the western tip of the Mornington Peninsula, between Sorrento and Rye, and is one of many popular holiday destinations for Melburnians along this narrow peninsula strip. It is bordered on the north by Port Phillip, and on the south by Bass Strait and a series of surf beaches interspersed with spectacular cliffs and rocky ledges. It is frequented by tourists in the summer months, and has been featured on numerous travel programs.

Blairgowrie Pier is the most popular shore dive site for recreational scuba diving inside Port Phillip. It was built as a safe boat harbour and marina by the Blairgowrie Yacht Squadron. Blairgowrie Pier is highly regarded for the more than a hundred different species of nudibranch that have been identified there. Each year from May through July thousands of spider crabs migrate along the ocean floor to the cool, shallow waters around Blairgowrie Pier. When the water temperature drops, the spider crabs moult their shells. While their new shells harden, they crowd together for protection from predators like stingrays, seals and sharks, sometimes forming stacks more than a metre high. There are also octopus, cuttlefish, seahorses, box fish, large stingrays, decorator crabs, stargazers, invertebrate, goat fish, blennies, and much colour underwater at Blairgowrie Pier.

After leaving that station in 1984, she worked as a sports anchor for four other New York area radio stations until 1987, including a brief stint as an update person at WFAN in New York City.

===1987–1991===
In 1987, Cohn made sportscasting history by becoming the first full-time U.S. female sports anchor on a national radio network when she was hired by ABC. She anchored WABC TalkRadio from 1987 to 1989. In 1988, Cohn got her first television break, after being hired by what was at the time one of ESPN&#x27;s top competitors, SportsChannel America. In 1989, she hosted a call-in radio sports show in New York.

Cohn was a reporter at the SportsChannel America Network before being hired by KIRO-TV in Seattle, Washington to work as a sports anchor there.

===ESPN (1992–present)===
Cohn returned to the East Coast in 1992, when she was hired by ESPN to work on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. She anchored her first SportsCenter on July 11, 1992, with Chris Myers. She has also been featured in many of the show&#x27;s &quot;This Is SportsCenter&quot; commercials. Despite her success, Cohn was almost fired in 1994 because the network argued that she wasn&#x27;t showing her love for sports on TV. The company gave her six months to improve and hired a video coach to help her out.

In addition to her work as a sports journalist, Cohn made a name for herself as a prognosticator during the 1997 NCAA basketball tournament. Her bracket that year for ESPN accurately predicted 15th-seeded Coppin State University’s shocking victory over South Carolina in the first round, to this day one of the greatest upsets in the tournament&#x27;s history.

In 2005, Cohn signed a contract extension with ESPN, which added play-by-play for WNBA telecasts to her duties. On June 20, 2008, ESPN announced that Cohn would be a regular anchor for the new morning block of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, which launched on August 11 that year. She was to have been the co-anchor, alongside Steve Berthiaume, of the first three hours of the block, from 6 to 9 a.m. ET on weekdays. Several weeks later, however, ESPN announced that the new &quot;SportsCenter&quot; morning block would be scaled back from nine to six hours.

She hosted her 5,000th edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on February 21, 2016, a record for &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors. Cohn continues to regularly anchor &quot;SportsCenter&quot; from 1–3 p.m. ET Monday through Friday. She is also the host of the podcast &quot;Listen Closely to Linda Cohn&quot;.

Cohn has reported, commentated, interviewed, written, and called play-by-play throughout her career at ESPN. Since 2016, she has co-hosted &quot;SportsCenter&quot; from Los Angeles on weekends with Neil Everett.

The network suspended Cohn for saying in an April 2017 radio interview that left-wing bias at the network had contributed to a loss of subscribers.

In mid-July 2018, ESPN issued a press release announcing that Cohn had &quot;signed a new deal to remain with the company for years to come.&quot; The contract included continued anchor duties on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and increased ice hockey coverage&quot;.&quot; Executive Vice President Norby Williamson noted that in her 26 years with the network, Cohn had &quot;hosted more &quot;SportsCenter&quot;s than anyone else.&quot; The deal says she will continue as primary host of &quot;In the Crease&quot; on ESPN+ as it expands to five nights a week during the NHL season and will contribute hockey-related interviews and features to &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and other ESPN platforms.

===Author===
In 2008, Cohn released her memoir, &quot;Cohn-Head: A No-Holds-Barred Account of Breaking Into the Boys&#x27; Club&quot;, in which she recounts her passion for sports and her experiences working on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Cohn has two children with her ex-husband Stew Kaufman. The couple divorced in 2008.

In 2014, Cohn was named one of the 25 most influential women in sports. She is a fan of the New York Giants, New York Mets, New York Knicks, and New York Rangers.

<text>Cape Schanck, or &quot;Tunnahan&quot; (Boonwurrung) is a locality at the southernmost tip of the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, approximately south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Cape Schanck recorded a population of 569 at the 2021 census.

Cape Schanck separates the wild ocean waters of Bass Strait from the slightly calmer waters of Western Port. The most recognisable symbol of Cape Schanck is the Cape Schanck Lighthouse. The lighthouse was built in 1859 and was the second lighthouse built in Victoria. A prominent rock outcrop is Pulpit Rock and stands out at the very tip of the cape.

Cape Schanck is also home to the RACV Resort Cape Schanck on Boneo Road which includes an eighteen-hole golf course and The National Golf Club on Cups Drive.

British-Australian artist Georgiana McCrae produced many of her paintings at Cape Schanck.

A keen artist–traveller in the Romantic tradition, Nicholas Chevalier concentrated on effects of atmosphere, mood and dramatic lighting in his depictions of the iconic natural wonders he found at Cape Schanck.

==History==

The traditional Boonwurrung name for the cape is Tunnahan.

The location was given its European name in 1800 after Captain John Schank, R.N. (note spelling with only one &#x27;c&#x27;) by Lieutenant James Grant sailing on the &quot;Lady Nelson&quot;.
Schank had designed the raised keel (or centreboard) on the &quot;Lady Nelson&quot;. The spelling of the locality as &#x27;Schanck&#x27; (two c&#x27;s) is a misspelling of Schank.
Nicolas Baudin called it Cap Richelieu when he sailed past on the Géographe on 30 March 1802.

Cape Schanck Post Office opened around March 1879 and closed in 1962.

In 1893 a steamship, the SS &quot;Alert&quot;, sank off the coast at Cape Schanck during a storm. It was rediscovered after 113 years on the ocean floor in June 2007.

==Flora and fauna==

Albatrosses (black-browed, Chatham, yellow-nosed, etc.) are occasionally spotted off the cliffs as are short-tailed shearwaters (particularly during their spring migration), black-faced and pied cormorants, kelp gulls and Australasian gannets. The shrubs decorating the area are frequently home to brown thornbills, singing honeyeaters and a number of other passerines. The elusive striated fieldwren has also been known to inhabit the area. Some flora include cushion bushes.

<doc id="611619" wikidata="Q1688507" url="?curid=611619" title="Jetsgo">
<text>Jetsgo Corporation was a short-lived Canadian low-cost airline based in the Saint-Laurent borough of Montreal. Jetsgo served 19 destinations across Canada, 10 destinations in the United States, and 12 scheduled weekend-charter destinations in the Caribbean. At the time the third-largest carrier in the country, Jetsgo abruptly ended service and entered bankruptcy protection on March 11, 2005, leaving thousands of passengers stranded at the beginning of the busy March-break travel season. According to news outlets, the airline was processing orders and taking payments for flights the night before they claimed bankruptcy and ceased operations.

Soon after its demise, the company pledged to make a comeback as a charter-only airline. However, on May 13, 2005, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection, cancelled plans to relaunch service and began the process of liquidation.

==History==

Jetsgo was launched on June 12, 2002, and ceased operations on March 11, 2005. The airline was Canada&#x27;s third-largest airline at the time, controlling up to 10% of the domestic market. Expert analysts widely blame the airline for poor management. Founder Michel Leblanc had previously founded Royal Aviation, which he later sold to Canada 3000.

On March 11, 2005, Jetsgo abruptly announced that it had ceased operations. The action stranded thousands of passengers in airports and at their travel destinations with no way home, the defunct airline having made no arrangements with other carriers to handle their passengers. This occurred on the Friday morning before the March Break holiday season, one of the busiest air travel days in 8 of 10 provinces.

1200 employees lost their jobs. Jetsgo had accumulated $55 million in debt in the last eight months before it closed. Employees were finally paid for the time prior to the airline&#x27;s shutdown on March 14, 2005. Passengers who had purchased Jetsgo tickets were forced to apply for refunds through their credit card companies or travel agencies. Air Canada and WestJet ran additional flights to bring the stranded passengers home.

Because of its abrupt shutdown, the Jetsgo name was frequently corrupted to &quot;Jetsgone&quot; in some media reports. Passenger Satoshi Takano also used this term for a website which he created for former employees. It operated under that name for some time after the company&#x27;s demise.

In February 2007 the media reported that the United States military was using the former call sign assigned to Jetsgo during flights over European Union (EU) territory. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; said that the call sign had been used by military flights involving so-called &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; of political detainees to black site destinations.

==Staff==
The airline employed 1,350 people at the time that it filed for bankruptcy.

==Incidents and accidents==
In March 2005 Transport Canada said that investigators found issues with the operating methods of Jetsgo. The deficiencies were discovered during &quot;a special inspection&quot; into engine problems revealed after a forced landing in Toronto in January 2005.
Number of incidents reported on a yearly basis concerning Jetsgo:

*2002: 5
*2003: 15
*2004: 32
*2005: 7
*Total (2002–2005): 60

On 20 January 2005 a Jetsgo McDonnell Douglas MD-83 landing in poor weather and low visibility at Calgary International Airport, in Calgary, Alberta, veered left off runway 34 and hit a runway hold-short sign, damaging landing gear and flaps. The plane then declared a missed approach, took off and landed again. There were no casualties.

Seating in all aircraft was configured in an &quot;all-economy&quot; setting typical of low-cost carriers. Jetsgo also had special &quot;comfort plus&quot; sections on most of their planes, which featured more leg room on seats A and B in rows 1 - 12, as well as no middle seat.

<text>Crib Point is a town on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Crib Point recorded a population of 3,343 at the 2021 census.

The town is part of an urban enclave on Western Port comprising Bittern, Crib Point, Hastings, Tyabb, and Somerville.

Crib Point is served by three railway stations: Morradoo, Crib Point and Stony Point, the latter of which is the terminus of the greater-metropolitan Stony Point line.

Crib Point Post Office opened on 18 July 1890.

The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League.

It is situated near the HMAS Cerberus naval base.

It is opposite a park that has a long stretch of mangroves.

The Victorian Maritime Centre is temporarily located at Crib Point. It has a future permanent site announced at Hastings. The museum houses many artefacts of both the Royal Australian Navy and the Merchant Navy.

==Internationally Significant Ramsar Listed Wetland and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve==

Crib Point is one of the coastal villages of the Mornington Peninsula. This coastline is part of the internationally significant Ramsar listed wetland which covers most of Westernport Bay - an area of 59,297ha. It is also a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve - Western Port Biosphere Reserve. Despite these two significant and critical attributes which mean it is fundamental to birdlife, fish breeding and many unique species, there has been unrelenting pressure to exploit this natural asset since the 60s. To this day, there are the remains of industry at Crib Point

The communities of Westernport have successfully fought off attempts to reindustrialise the area.

History:
*1965 to 1985 – BP Westernport Refinery at Crib Point jetty
*1987 - Proposed Western Mining ammonia-urea plant (STOPPED)
*1992 - Proposed Shell-Mobil &quot;super-tanker&quot; project (STOPPED)
*2007 - Proposed Boral Bitumen plant (STOPPED)
*2011 - Port of Hastings Container Port strategy (STOPPED)

==Climate==

Crib Point has an oceanic climate with relative small thermal differences between seasons, but is still prone to temperature extremes upon northerly winds both in summer and winter.

<doc id="611622" wikidata="Q4043172" url="?curid=611622" title="Loop unswitching">
<text>Loop unswitching is a compiler optimization. It moves a conditional inside a loop outside of it by duplicating the loop&#x27;s body, and placing a version of it inside each of the if and else clauses of the conditional. This can improve the parallelization of the loop. Since modern processors can operate quickly on vectors, this improvement increases the speed of the program.

Here is a simple example. Suppose we want to add the two arrays &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; and also do something depending on the variable &quot;w&quot;. We have the following C code:
 int i, w, x[1000], y[1000];
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
 x[i] += y[i];
 if (w)
 y[i] = 0;


The conditional inside this loop makes it difficult to safely parallelize this loop. When we unswitch the loop, this becomes:
 int i, w, x[1000], y[1000];
 if (w) {
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
 x[i] += y[i];
 y[i] = 0;
 } else {
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
 x[i] += y[i];
 }
While the loop unswitching may double the amount of code written, each of these new loops may now be separately optimized.

Loop unswitching was introduced in gcc in version 3.4.

<doc id="611623" wikidata="Q5308257" url="?curid=611623" title="Dromana, Victoria">
<text>Dromana ( ) is a seaside suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Dromana recorded a population of 6,626 at the 2021 census.

==Geography==

Dromana is located in Victoria, south of the capital city, Melbourne, between Mornington and St Andrews Beach. It is located west of Merricks Beach and French Island. Overlooking Dromana from the south, Arthurs Seat is the highest point on the Mornington Peninsula.

==History==
Prior to European colonisation, the area now known as Dromana was known to the Boonwurrung as &quot;Kangerrong&quot;.

It is believed that the name Dromana is of Irish origin and that it came about from the influx of gold prospectors in the late 1830s. There is a Dromana on the tidal section of the Blackwater River, near Cappoquin, County Waterford in Ireland, and this is the most likely origin of the name.

In 1841, Hugh Jamieson purchased , or eight square miles, of land from the Crown for £1 an acre under the terms of the short-lived Special Survey regulations. 
The purchase included the northern part of the present suburb of Dromana to the east of Safety Beach. The area is known as Jamieson&#x27;s Special Survey in cadastral surveys.

The first subdivision of Crown lands in Dromana occurred in 1854.
Dromana Post Office opened on 12 April 1858. The completion of its pier took place in 1872, allowing the shipping of produce to the city markets. In 1881, Dromana was well established as a seaside resort. 
A travel brochure of the time describes it as follows: &quot;Sheltered from the untempered violence of the elements by the lofty ranges by which it is encircled, Dromana presents an air of homely comfort, singularly foreign to the majority of watering places.&quot; Dromana was proclaimed a town in February 1861.

A major contributor to the development of Dromana was Spencer Jackson. One of his greatest achievements was the facilitation of the construction of a road to the summit of Arthurs Seat in 1929. Dromana&#x27;s pier was much longer in those days and Dromana shared with Sorrento the ability to accommodate the bay steamers which did much to promote Dromana as a tourist destination. The McKeown and Shaw families ran guest houses for over half a century.

One of the oldest buildings that remains is the Dromana Hotel, established in 1862 by Richard Watkin, but it was a much more beautiful building before Lou Carrigg commissioned Howard Lawson to remodel the facade in 1934. There was a racecourse behind the hotel for years, as well as one near the site of the Dromana Secondary College. The Arthurs Seat Hotel, which stood on the west corner of Esplanade and Permien St was destroyed by a fire in 1898.

Much of the early work in the area involved cutting, sawing and dressing timber from Arthurs Seat for the construction of piers around the bay and at Flinders. Farmers were involved with this livelihood and were carting the wood on Bullock drays to Captain Peter Pidoto&#x27;s Little Angelina to Sheepwash Creek. Many of the grantees of land around the township were at first tenants on Jamieson&#x27;s Special Survey. (Sources as above plus Rosebud;Flower of the Peninsula.)
Dromana&#x27;s commercial centre is concentrated on Point Nepean Road, with Arthurs Seat and surrounding bushland providing a scenic backdrop. Across the road is an attractive foreshore with calm, sandy beaches, including designated camping areas. It is also home to the D.A. Christie Public Barbecue, which started manufacture in the Dromana Industrial Estate in 1974. Points of interest along the coast include the Dromana Pier, the rocky cutting at Anthonys Nose and the Mornington Peninsula Visitor Information Centre.

==Present day==

Dromana is known for its number of vineyards. More than 22 separate vintners operate within Dromana, as well as several vineyards. 
The Dromana 3 Drive-In cinema is a popular entertainment spot for locals and holidaymakers alike.

Overlooking Dromana from the south Arthurs Seat, is the highest point on the Mornington Peninsula offering panoramic views of Port Phillip, Safety Beach, Mount Martha, Rosebud and Portsea.

Dromana&#x27;s retail environment is mostly restaurants and take away food shops, present on the main strip is also a drive through bottle shop, it also has a small shopping centre that contains Bakers Delight, Ritchies IGA, café, pharmacy, newsagent and a liquor store.

The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League.

<doc id="611626" wikidata="Q5459405" url="?curid=611626" title="Flinders, Victoria">
<text>Flinders is a seaside town on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Flinders recorded a population of 1,130 at the 2021 census.

Flinders is located at the point where Western Port meets Bass Strait.

==History==

The town was named by George Bass after his friend, the explorer and British naval officer Matthew Flinders. Settlement commenced in 1854 and many pioneers and settlers are buried at the Flinders cemetery. Flinders Post Office opened on 7 March 1863 as the population grew.

Flinders was once believed to have previously been known as Mendi-Moke, but this has subsequently been denied.

==Present day==

Features of the town include the Flinders Golf Club, a picturesque golf course built on a cliff top, a recreation reserve, a small yacht club, and a long pier out from the protected beach, sheltered from the waters of Bass Strait by West Head. This area is popular for sailing, fishing, and other watersports.

On the southern side of West Head, the ocean breaks over the basalt rocks of Mushroom Reef Marine Sanctuary at Flinders ocean beach. Mushroom Reef hosts one of Victoria&#x27;s best intertidal and subtidal rock platform reefs, popular for beachcombing, recreational diving, snorkelling, and surfing. Several accommodation options exist, including B&amp;Bs and hotel-motel style accommodation. Shopping and a mobile library are also available to tourists and residents.

Flinders was the original home of Flinders Bread, available throughout Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula. The company&#x27;s operations are now based in Dandenong, but the bread is still available locally.

The Royal Australian Navy operate a weapons training facility and gunnery on West Head, with public access to this area being restricted.

Flinders is served by bus route 782 from Frankston, operated by Ventura Bus Lines.

Flinders Pier is popular for recreational scuba diving activities. It is home to the spectacular weedy sea dragon, as well as many other marine species including cuttlefish, large smooth rays and eagle rays, crabs and many other species.

Save Flinders Pier Campaign

On 21 July 2020, The Victorian Government announced the planned &quot;... demolition of the inner section of the old Flinders Pier&quot; in a media announcement entitled Major Pier Upgrades to Create Jobs and Boost Economy. The media announcement coincided with peak COVID cases and went unreported at the time. The community was alerted on 17 March 2021 in an email from Cr. David Gill, who outlined the threat to the pier; leading to the discovery of the Minister&#x27;s unreported media announcement. On 8 May 2021, a public meeting was organised by the Flinders Community Association and subsequently attended by 300 people. At this meeting, the proposed demolition of the historic pier and its impact on the habitat of the Weedy Sea Dragon at Flinders Pier were discussed, and the Save Flinders Pier campaign was formed, led by Charles Reis and a small group of volunteers. Three critical issues were identified at the meeting which would subsequently inform the Campaign Strategy: (i) the likelihood that removal of the first 180m could lead to the timber pier&#x27;s full removal given the age of the whole structure; (ii) the possible impact on the habitat of the Weedy Sea Dragon; and (iii) the potential loss of an historic maritime artefact. An online petition quickly built a strong following that eventually reached 42,000 signatories and raised approx. $40,000 in donations; while a petition in village shops recorded a further 2,800 signatories. In July 2021, Sir David Attenborough wrote a letter expressing his concern for the pier habitat of the Weedy Sea Dragon, which was published in The Age newspaper and reported on ABC News and each of Victoria&#x27;s commercial television news services. On 20 July 2021, the community through the Flinders District Historical Society nominated the pier precinct to the Victorian Heritage Register. This was followed with a letter from the Chairperson of the Save Flinders Pier campaign on 1 August 2021 to all Members of Parliament in the Upper and Lower houses, requesting action to be taken to stop the planned demolition. On 7 September 2021, the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council voted unanimously to Save Flinders Pier, observing in Council Meeting Minutes that &quot;the Flinders Pier holds significant historical, social, aesthetic, and environmental values and attracts beneficial tourism to the Western Port region.&quot; Meanwhile, campaign organisers continued to build public awareness by undertaking its own Condition Report of the Flinders Pier. The group established a social media presence featuring its events such as the Flinders Pier beach-clean up supported by Sea Shepherd, Dive for the Pier, Jump for the Pier, School Art Project and towing a &#x27;Weedy Trailer&#x27; up and down the Mornington Peninsula during the summer of 2021/22. &quot;&#x27;Save Flinders Pier&#x27;&quot; signage was displayed on front fences, in shop windows, on the pier itself and along many of the popular walking trails around Red Hill, Merricks and Cape Schanck. Bumper stickers were printed and given out. Merchandise including caps, tee-shirts, hoodies and beanies supporting the group&#x27;s message were sourced and then sold through the Flinders General Store to help raise funds and increase awareness. The group also used local newspapers and talk-back radio, notably ABC and 3AW, to convey its concern for the pier&#x27;s future. On 22 February 2022, the Hon. Cathrine Burnett-Wake MP took to the floor of the Parliament of Victoria and requested funding to be directed to the repair and restoration of Flinders Pier. The Hon. Melissa Horne, Minister for Ports, replied at the time that &quot;The intent was never to retain a parallel inner structure (of Flinders Pier) beyond the end of its economic life.&quot; In March 2022, Heritage Victoria completed an assessment of the cultural heritage significance of the Flinders Telegraph Cable Complex and Pier, and recommended that Flinders Pier and the nearby cable station precinct be included on the Victorian Heritage Register as a place of State-level cultural significance with objects integral. The recommendation specifically cited the pier&#x27;s historic connection to (i) the cable station precinct; (ii) scientists and enthusiasts with an interest in the marine life beneath Flinders Pier; and (iii) the &quot;resonance of social value&quot; demonstrated by the public response to the proposed demolition. It further noted that the integrity of the pier remains in its general form, materials and orientation, notwithstanding frequent repairs and replacement of components. The campaign suffered a setback on 9 April 2022 when volunteer and marine biologist, Trent Williams, unexpectedly died during a scuba dive. An Obituary written by the Save Flinders Pier campaign Chairperson and published in The Age and Sydney Morning Herald described Mr Williams as a passionate environmental campaigner known for his voluntary endeavours to protect the marine environment. The Age newspaper later reported a possible link between the death of Mr Williams and a WorkSafe investigation into an air tank re-filling service in East Gippsland. On 3 May 2022, the Victorian Government released its 2022/23 Budget. On page 116 of Budget Paper 3, a reference was made that &quot;Funding is provided to undertake critical works on... the Old Flinders Jetty&quot;. The following day, Chris Brayne MP said that the Government would commit $1.5m for planning and restoration works. The Age newspaper reported the story with an article entitled &quot;Jubilation from community after plans to restore Flinders Pier&quot;. Following confirmation that Flinders Pier would not be demolished, plans commenced to demobilise the Save Flinders Pier campaign. On 12 May 2022, Cathrine Burnett-Wake MP addressed the Legislative Council of the Victorian Parliament and said: &quot;&quot;I rise to congratulate the Save Flinders Pier committee for their success in saving the pier from demolition... It was only through their persistence and hard work that this result was achieved&quot; (Hansard, page 1495).&quot; On 9 August 2022, the Heritage Council of Victoria considered the Heritage Victoria recommendation for listing the Flinders Pier on its Register. The closed hearing of Heritage Council members followed with a 90 Day Determination Period. On 1 September, The Mornington Peninsula Shire Council published a Community Advocacy Brochure entitled &quot;&#x27;Shout Out for the Peninsula&quot;&#x27; which described the Save Flinders Pier campaign as a case study in community advocacy. On 7 September, Liberal Party candidate for Nepean, Sam Groth, made an election pledge of $3.5m to the restoration of Flinders Pier. Mr Groth made the commitment to a community gathering at Flinders Pier alongside James Newbury MP Shadow Minister for Ports and Cathrine Burnett-Wake MP, Member for Eastern Victoria. On 14 October 2022, the Save Flinders Campaign suspended further activity when the Heritage Council of Victoria announced its decision that the Flinders Pier and Telegraph Cable Complex &quot;... is of State-level cultural heritage significance and is to be included in the Victorian Heritage Register.&quot; The Heritage Council decision provided formal protection of the pier, ensuring that demolition was now highly unlikely. The story was reported a few days later in the Mornington Peninsula News where it was described as the first pier on the Mornington Peninsula to be Heritage listed. On 22 December 2022, Parks Victoria issued a Project Status update, informing the community that it has commenced the initial planning, design options and permit stages for repairing Flinders Pier. On 5 September 2023, the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council approved the Flinders Foreshore Precinct Conservation Management Plan prepared on behalf of Parks Victoria by BIOSIS which details the pier and precinct history and applicable conservation policies and guidelines. The 126 page report was prepared in consultation with the Save Flinders Pier campaign, the Flinders District Historical Society and the Flinders Community Association. Completion of repairs to the Flinders Pier and associated works are expected to occur in 2025.

<text>Loop splitting is a compiler optimization technique. It attempts to simplify a loop or eliminate dependencies by breaking it into multiple loops which have the same bodies but iterate over different contiguous portions of the index range.

==Loop peeling==
Loop peeling is a special case of loop splitting which splits any problematic first (or last) few iterations from the loop and performs them outside of the loop body.

Suppose a loop was written like this:

 int p = 10;
 for (int i=0; i&lt;10; ++i)
 y[i] = x[i] + x[p];
 p = i;

Notice that codice_1 only for the first iteration, and for all other iterations, codice_2. A compiler can take advantage of this by unwinding (or &quot;peeling&quot;) the first iteration from the loop.

After peeling the first iteration, the code would look like this:

 y[0] = x[0] + x[10];
 for (int i=1; i&lt;10; ++i)
 y[i] = x[i] + x[i-1];

This equivalent form eliminates the need for the variable codice_3 inside the loop body.

Loop peeling was introduced in gcc in version 3.4. More generalised loop splitting was added in GCC 7.

== Brief history of the term ==
Apparently the term &quot;peeling&quot; was for the first time used by Cannings, Thompson and Skolnick in their 1976 paper on computational models for (human) inheritance. There the term was used to denote a method for collapsing phenotypic information onto parents. From there the term was used again in their papers, including their seminal paper on probability functions on complex pedigrees.

In compiler technology, the term first turned up in late 1980s papers on VLIW and superscalar compilation, including and.

<text>Apocalyptic Raids is an EP by Swiss extreme metal band Hellhammer. It was recorded and released in March 1984, and was the band&#x27;s only commercial release.

The record was a major influence on the then-emerging death metal and black metal genres. It has served as an inspiration to such varied and respected bands as Napalm Death and Sepultura, both of whom recorded cover versions of &quot;Messiah&quot;.

Hellhammer split up only three months after recording this EP, and later regrouped as Celtic Frost. The EP would be reissued six years later as Apocalyptic Raids 1990 A.D., boasting new artwork and two bonus tracks.

==Artwork==
The cover art of &quot;Apocalyptic Raids&quot; is influenced by German Expressionism&#x27;s stark aesthetic, combining monochromaticity with the band&#x27;s blood-red, blackletter-styled logo.

==Track listings==

Tracks 5 and 6 were originally part of the now out-of-print &quot;Death Metal&quot; (1984) compilation.

<doc id="611636" wikidata="Q1108255" url="?curid=611636" title="Film4">
<text>Film4 is a British free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned by Channel Four Television Corporation launched on 1 November 1998, dedicated to broadcasting films. The standard-definition channel is available on Freeview and Freesat platforms, while the high-definition variant is offered free on Freely, and as a pay television service on satellite and cable.

The channel offered an online video on demand service, Film4oD until it was closed in July 2015.

==History==
===1998–2001: Early years and launch===
The network has its origins in Channel Four Films, a production company opened by Channel Four Television Corporation in 1982 which has been responsible for backing a large number of films made in the United Kingdom and around the world. The company&#x27;s first production was Stephen Frears&#x27; &quot;Walter&quot;, which was released in the same year.

In the late 1990s, Film4 Productions partnered with Showtime Australia in its first foreign co-financing venture, with Miranda Dear appointed in 1996 as production and acquisition consultant. During this time the collaboration produced John Polson&#x27;s &quot;Siam Sunset&quot; and Mark Lamprell&#x27;s &quot;My Mother Frank&quot; in Australia. Dear left FilmFour in July 2000, to became commissioning editor of drama at SBS independent (the production arm of public broadcaster SBS), after which FilmFour closed its Australian office.

On 1 November 1998, the production company was re-branded as FilmFour to coincide with the launch of a new digital television channel of the same name on both Sky and ONdigital platforms, becoming Channel 4&#x27;s second network. At its launch, it was a subscription-only service costing £6 a month, eventually rising to £7. The launch night (which also broadcasts on Channel 4) was hosted by Johnny Vaughan and the first film to be shown was &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot;, as well as the launch evening also featured its British network television premiere of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.

On 31 March 2000 at 6.00am, the analogue version of FilmFour shut down and later switched to digital.

===2001–2006: Expansion===
On 7 April 2001, FilmFour expanded with the launch of three additional digital networks. FilmFour World carried the best of international cinema and broadcast from 4:00pm to 10:00pm, while FilmFour Extreme carried &quot;controversial and cutting-edge&quot; movies, and broadcast from 10:00pm-4:00am, both of which operated on a timeshare. The other addition was the timeshift service FilmFour +1, which carried all of the main channel&#x27;s films an hour later. All three channels were initially exclusive to Sky Digital but were made available on NTL cable from November-December 2001.

In July 2002, Channel 4 reduced FilmFour&#x27;s budget from £30 to £10 million and cut 50 staff to curb mounting losses, reintegrating FilmFour as a division of its television operation to continue to invest in new films. The cuts were a consequence of FilmFour&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts to compete with Hollywood. David Thompson, head of BBC Films described it as:
 Also in the same year, Tessa Ross became the head of both FilmFour and Channel 4 drama. 

On 31 March 2003, Channel 4 announced that FilmFour Extreme and FilmFour World would be replaced with a singular network - FilmFour Weekly, on 5 May. FilmFour Weekly was formatted as a &quot;catch-up&quot; network, broadcasting three movies across the week at the same time each day. Films that previously broadcast on Extreme and World would move to the regular FilmFour.

===2006–present: Transition to free-to-air===
On 3 July 2006, Channel 4 announced that FilmFour would relaunch as a free-to-air network on 23 July, as it would see its addition to Freeview, and begin to air advertisements during films. The channel would also be renamed as Film4, alongside its timeshift service and the production company. The original subscription version of FilmFour and FilmFour +1 closed for the final time on 19 July, with FilmFour Weekly also ceasing broadcast to make way for the relaunch. The new free-to-air Film4 launched on 23 July at 9pm, with the UK free-to-air premiere of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; as its first film. Due to the change, the channel&#x27;s availability increased from 300,000 (subscribers) to 18 million households. It also changed its broadcasting hours from 12.45pm to 8.45am to 3.00pm to 3.00am. The switch to becoming a free channel meant it also lost the ability to adhere to looser broadcasting regulations regarding content on subscription channels - it thus now routinely edits films to make them suitable for pre-watershed screenings before 9pm and removes particularly explicit content from the more extreme material it shows after that time. Most post-9pm films are unedited though.

Prior to the arrivals of Movie Mix and Movies4Men on the Freeview platform, Film4 was the only free film channel available on digital terrestrial television. 

In 2007, the broadcasting hours were amended to 1.00pm to 4.00am. On 20 August 2007, Film4 +1 was removed from Freeview to make way for Channel 4 +1. From 23 May 2009, the broadcasting hours were amended again to 11.00am to 4.00am, with the downtime hours broadcasting either teleshopping or an animated caption screen stating when the channel will return. On 20 July 2010, a high-definition simulcast – Film4 HD launched exclusively on Virgin Media&#x27;s cable television platform on channel 429, only available on certain packages. On 1 November 2010, Film4 partnered with FilmFlex to launch Film4oD. On 27 August 2013, Film4 +1 returned to Freeview. Film4 HD launched on Sky on 2 September 2013 as a subscription network, requiring Sky&#x27;s HD package. Film4 HD is not available on Freeview.

On 2 September 2014, Film4 debuted a new on-air look, designed by Man vs. Machine. There are 15 new idents in the series which run alongside a new on-screen presentation. On 26 November 2014, Film4 +1 became available via Freeview HD services only. On 10 January 2019, Film4 +1 was moved from the Freeview HD PSB3 (DVB-T2) multiplex to the Freeview PSB2 (DVB-T) multiplex, making the service available once again to viewers with non-HD Freeview systems and television sets that are incapable of decoding DVB-T2 signals. The capacity on PSB2 was made available by the &quot;Sewing Quarter&quot; service moving to Freeview COM6 (DVB-T) multiplex operated by Arqiva.

<text>Thunderpuss is the (mainly dance) remix/production team of Los Angeles–based music producers Barry Harris and Chris Cox. Harris had previously worked as part of several music groups including Kon Kan, Top Kat, Killer Bunnies and Outta Control and had also released several solo singles himself. Cox, a musician and DJ, had also worked for years as a DJ and producer, producing a megamix of Paula Abdul songs, among other things, and started his own record label, Interhit Records, with Jeff Johnson.

== History ==

Harris and Cox originally met in New York City in 1990 while Harris was recording &quot;Syntonic&quot;, Kon Kan&#x27;s second album. They became friends and remained in contact for years, with Harris eventually joining Cox at Interhit Records in Los Angeles in January 1998. They did not start working together as a production team until September 1997. Their first project as Thunderpuss was a cover of the song &quot;I Just Wanna Be Your Everything&quot;, with Thea Austin, formerly of Snap!, performing vocals. They also produced Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;The Dance Album&quot;, but did not use the name Thunderpuss. They also produced original songs for various artists, including Abigail (&quot;Let the Joy Rise&quot; and &quot;If It Don&#x27;t Fit&quot;), Amber (&quot;Taste the Tears&quot;) and Soluna. During this time, they also released remix singles under the name &#x27;Thunderpuss 2000&#x27;, most notably covers of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot; and Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

Over the course of six years (1998–2003), Thunderpuss were in demand as remixers, their first work together being a remix of Billie Myers&#x27; &quot;Kiss the Rain&quot; in 1998. Their breakout success was a hit re-working of &quot;It&#x27;s Not Right but It&#x27;s Okay&quot; by Whitney Houston. This was quickly followed by a remix of &quot;Sexual (La Di Di)&quot; by Amber, a hit in 1999. Other artists who received the remix treatment included Madonna, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, NSYNC, and Celine Dion.

Thunderpuss themselves also put out several later singles as artists, including &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Pigbag&quot;, a fully electronic dance cover of the Pigbag song which reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1982, &quot;Stand Up&quot; (with Latanza Waters) and &quot;FMH&quot; (under the artist name Harris &amp; Cox).

Thunderpuss went their separate ways in July 2003. Chris Cox continues to produce, remix and DJ around the world. Barry Harris also returned to producing &amp; DJing, creating dance remixes of tracks for PINK, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Chainsmokers, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Todrick Hall, Adele, Calvin Harris, Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Ellie Goulding, Meghan Trainor and Sia, among others.

Thunderpuss reformed in 2022 to remix &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry For Me&quot; by Whitney Houston, and have been doing nightclub and festival appearances around the United States.

<text>Hastings (Parre Eurruc-Eurruc in Boonwurrung) is a town on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Hastings recorded a population of 10,369 at the 2021 census.

Hastings is part of an urban enclave on Western Port comprising Hastings, Bittern, Crib Point, Tyabb, and Somerville. It is served by Hastings railway station on the Stony Point greater-metropolitan line, although the station has been suspended following a fire that destroyed the station building in the early hours of 21 December 2024. 

Hastings is situated on an inlet on Western Port, a major port and important environmental area. Hastings has multiple marinas and is home to many recreational boating activities.

==History==

Hastings is thought to be named after a fishing town in England or the British imperial administrator Warren Hastings. Previously known as King&#x27;s Creek and Star Point, its post office opened on 4 February 1863.

Settlement of the area dates from the 1840s, with fishing being the main industry. Growth took place from the 1850s into the 1870s as the township developed. Expansion continued in the late 1880s and 1890s, aided by the construction of the railway line and the establishment of many orchards. Significant residential development occurred during the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by industrial growth and public housing construction. Growth began to slow from the 1980s. The population has increased since the early 1990s, a result of new dwellings being added to the area.

==Local culture==

Hastings is one of the &#x27;gateways&#x27; to the lower Mornington Peninsula, and is located on the coast of Western Port. The town is surrounded by farmland.

In 2004 Hastings was the overall winner of the Victorian Tidy Town Awards held by the Keep Australia Beautiful Network.

In 2021, Hastings had a population of 10,369 and several major franchises have commenced operations. The opening of Kmart on 19 October 2006 was the first large department store in the town.

Hastings was the seat of the Hastings Shire before this was merged into the Mornington Peninsula Shire, and still has many buildings associated with federal, state and local governments. It has the headquarters of the regional traffic police. There is a modern library in the centre of town, outside of which is a statue of former resident and footballer, John Coleman. Other facilities include a public hall, and a modern aquatic centre.

Hastings has two public primary schools – Hastings Primary and Wallaroo Primary. There is also a private Catholic school named St Marys Primary School, as well as Western Port Secondary College, a state high school (formerly known as Hastings High School).

In October 2003 the town was host to The Princess Royal.

==Population==

According to the 2021 census, the population of Hastings is 10,369.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.4% of the population.
* 76.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 6.4%, New Zealand 1.7% and the Philippines 1.1%.
* 88.0% of people spoke only English at home.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 49.9%, Catholic 16.4% and Anglican 12.3%.

==Industry==

Hastings is home to the ExxonMobil and BlueScope manufacturing plants, and it is not uncommon to see large oil tankers docked near Long Island in Western Port. Hastings also hosts many small businesses associated with the recreational boating industry.

==Military==

The naval base HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot; is located south of Hastings in the suburb of Crib Point, housing many of its personnel on base. However some live in Hastings or other nearby towns. The local Naval Cadet unit, TS &quot;Tingira&quot;, is also located out of HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot;.

==Recreation and tourism==

Hastings has one small beach, most of the coastline being mudflats. The town also features several large coastline reserves, some of which allow pet dogs to roam leash-free.

Hastings is located on a crescent-shaped bay opening onto Western Port. It is probably the safest small boat harbour on Western Port, as it is easily accessible, and protected from prevailing winds. Therefore, much of the recreation centres around boating or fishing at the local marina and yacht club.

The mudflats support significant mangrove forests, these being the most southerly species of mangrove in the world. Jacks Beach Walk takes hikers through and over the mangroves via a series of boardwalks. The mangrove forests are natural fish hatcheries, important for the maintenance of good fish populations in the bay. A significant area of Western Port north of Hastings has been declared a Marine National Park.

The area around the pier is popular with sightseers, there being a waterfront cafe, and many yachts moored nearby. Pelicans can normally be seen in this area, and the pelicans are fed daily by local fishermen.

Other nearby attractions include the Tyabb antiques centre and Moonlit Sanctuary Wildlife Conservation Park.

The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League.

Another attraction visitors could attend is the Victorian Maritime Centre, at 220 The Esplanade Crib Point – open Saturday and Sundays 10am to 3pm. Their website is: www.maritimecentre.com.au

<doc id="611650" wikidata="Q5264705" url="?curid=611650" title="Desmond Doyle">
<text>Desmond Doyle (1924–1986) was an Irish painter and professional pianist, whose children (Evelyn, Maurice, Noel, John, Kevin, and Dermot) were taken into the custody of the Ireland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC).

==Background==
On 26 December 1953, Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day, Charlotte Doyle ran off with Desmond&#x27;s cousin, leaving the six children with neighbors in Fatima Mansions, a public housing complex.

The maternal grandmother offered to care for the children but Desmond was angry and refused to let his children have anything to do with her. Unemployed and looking for work he was unable to pay someone to care for his children and turned to ISPCC who placed the kids in industrial schools. Doyle had been advised the children could stay until he could care for them himself. Evelyn was sent to High Park Convent. Her five brothers were sent to the Boys Industrial School.

Doyle left to find work in England to earn enough money to set up a home for his children. While there, he met Jessie Powers née Cunningham, who was his landlady and who later accompanied him back to Ireland.

Upon returning in 1955, the State refused to give his children back without written permission from both the father and mother. Since the mother could not be located, the wishes of one parent acting alone did not count and the law stated they would not be released until they reached the age of 16.

==Campaign to return children to him==
Upon his return to his homeland in the autumn of 1954, Doyle petitioned for the return of his children. Nevertheless, the government denied his request, citing the best interests of the children. He subsequently fought a legal battle to regain custody of them, which required overturning the provisions of the Irish Children Act, 1941. This law prevented a father from caring for his own children in the absence of their mother if she was living unless she gave written permission for him to do so. Doyle became involved in a case presented before the Irish Supreme Court in which it was claimed that the Children&#x27;s Act contravened several sections of the Irish Constitution. In December 1955, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Desmond Doyle, and ordered that the children be returned to him and that his court costs were to be reimbursed by the government.

==Controversy==
Years later, the oldest Doyle, Evelyn, contacted her birthmother. She had remarried the cousin and started a second family. Charlotte described Desmond as abusive and an alcoholic, giving examples of him engaging in violent burst of aggression, sexual assaults and tirades. Half-siblings remembered being told Charlotte left that day after a violent episode and in fear for her life she ran out of the building, a stark contrast to Evelyn&#x27;s memory of Charlotte walking calmly out the door and across the street. Ann Walsh, daughter of Charlotte from the second family recounted an occasion Desmond beat her mother unconscious and had to throw cold water over her to bring her round. Three of the Doyle siblings conceded with the memory that their mother had been beaten. 
In her second memoir Evelyn admitted her father was an alcoholic and remembered loud arguments between her parents but said: &quot; ... everyone in the flats shouted and roared at each other.&quot;. Evelyn also admitted to frequently attempting to run away growing up and recalling one instance of her father hitting her until she was too weak to get off the floor when he thought she had shoplifted.

==Written accounts==
The events leading up to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision were recounted in the book &quot;Evelyn: A True Story&quot;. The story was also published as &quot;Tea and Green Ribbons: A Memoir&quot; (2003, Free Press, New York). Her sequel describing the Doyles&#x27; life and Evelyn&#x27;s life after the Supreme Court decision was published as &quot;Nothing Green: The Sequel to the Bestselling &quot;Evelyn&quot;&quot; (2004, Orion Publishing Group, London).

==Film based on events==
A highly fictionalised account of these events has been recorded in the film &quot;Evelyn&quot; (2002), starring Pierce Brosnan (who plays Desmond), Julianna Margulies, Sophie Vavasseur, Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn and Alan Bates and directed by Bruce Beresford. The film only showed three children, Evelyn and two brothers (Maurice and Dermot), instead of all six of the real-life family&#x27;s children, and involved no period in England or Jessie Powers.

<text>HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot; is a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) base that serves as the primary training establishment for RAN personnel. The base is located adjacent to Crib Point on the Mornington Peninsula, south of the Melbourne City Centre, Victoria, Australia. The base is also an official bounded locality of the Shire of Mornington Peninsula and is the only naval base to have a specific listing in the Australian census. HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot; recorded a population of 1,124 at the . A section of the base centred around the Parade Ground was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004, known as the HMAS Cerberus Central Area Group.

==History==
The site for the &quot;Cerberus&quot; naval base on Hanns Inlet, between Sandy Point and Stony Point on Western Port Bay was purchased in 1911. The base was opened in September 1920 and became known as Flinders Naval Depot in 1921. The Post Office opened on 2 December 1912 as Flinders Naval Base, was renamed Flinders Naval Depot in 1925 and HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot;, Westernport in 1963. &quot;Cerberus&quot; now occupies most of Stony Point to the north and all of Sandy Point in the south.

From 1930 until 1958, &quot;Cerberus&quot; was the home of the Royal Australian Naval College, until it was clear that the base was becoming overcrowded and the College was moved back to HMAS &quot;Creswell&quot;. With the outbreak of World War II, many temporary buildings were erected to facilitate the training of wartime recruits. Many of these buildings were later demolished or replaced.

== Climate ==
HMAS Cerberus possesses an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with tepid, relatively dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Average maxima vary from in February to in July, while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July. Mean precipitation is moderately low, averaging per annum, but rainfall is frequent, as HMAS Cerberus receives 169.1 precipitation days annually (with a maximum frequency of rain in winter). Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 7 February 2009 to on 3 July 2017.

==Facilities and operational units==
The primary role of HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot; has always been the training of RAN personnel. With the establishment of four tri-service schools over the last 13 years, this role has been extended to training Army and Air Force personnel. Specific courses offered include: the School of Survivability and Ship Safety which specialises in fire fighting, damage control and nuclear/biological/chemical defence; and seamanship and weapons training.

The base is also the home of the Recruit School – for all sailors their first contact with life in the RAN. HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot; comprises numerous training and recreation facilities, two chapels and a small marina. Training is provided for about 6,000 personnel annually, averaging 800 trainees at any one time.

===Crib Point Satellite Earth Station===
HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot; hosts the only dedicated weather-related Satellite Earth station in Australia, founded in 1991 and operated by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to service China&#x27;s first Turn Around Ranging Station (C-TARS) and servicing geostationary meteorological satellites, servicing Japan&#x27;s Himawari or GMS-4 and GMS-5. In August [2016], the BoM installed through a contractor Av-Comm, the first Australian ground station for the Himawari 8 weather satellite service.

===Recruit School===

The RAN recruit school is where all full-time and reserve general entry sailors complete their training. The full-time recruit course is eleven weeks in duration, and gives sailors the skills and knowledge required to conduct basic duties in the RAN, and prepare them for their specialised roles. Recruits join the RAN in monthly intakes, and these recruits are placed into one of four divisions. The recruits stay with their division for the entire eleven-week course. Some of the training and education conducted in the recruit course are:

* Teamwork exercises
* Uniform wearing and maintenance
* Drill and discipline
* First aid
* Survival at sea
* Basic ship maintenance and corrosion control
* Operation and proficiency on the service firearm, the F88 Austeyr
* Ship and sea combat survivability
* Physical training and fitness
* Basic seamanship

Part of the course includes a two-and-a-half-day sea familiarisation course.

===Engineering Faculty===

The engineering faculty is where Marine Technicians, Electronics Technicians, Marine Engineer Officers and Electronics Engineer Officers complete their employment training.

==Sport==
The base has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Southern Football League, as well as a hockey club competing in the Hockey Victoria competition. Golfers play at the Cerberus (HMAS Cerberus) Golf Club on Stony Point Road.

==Memorials and colours==
Numerous memorials are at the base with many including stained glass windows in the two chapels: Our Lady of the Sea (Catholic), and St Mark&#x27;s (Anglican/interdenominational). St Mark&#x27;s chapel also houses retired King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s colour flags of George V, George VI, and Elizabeth II.
