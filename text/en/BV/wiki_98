<text>Inverell is a large town in northern New South Wales, Australia, situated on the Macintyre River, close to the Queensland border. It is also the centre of Inverell Shire. Inverell is located on the Gwydir Highway on the western slopes of the Northern Tablelands. It has a temperate climate. In the , the population of Inverell was 12,057 and the Inverell Shire population was 17,853.

==History==
Prior to British colonisation, the Jukambal and Weraerai Aboriginal peoples lived in and occupied this region. Around 1838, colonist Peter MacIntyre directed his employee, Alexander Campbell, to take up land in the area for his sheep and cattle. Campbell subsequently laid claim to a large section of pastureland along the Macintyre River, which he called &#x27;Byron Plains&#x27; after Peter Byron, one of MacIntyre&#x27;s stockmen. Campbell later staked out 50,000 acres for himself on the southern side of Byron Plains. He named his run &#x27;Inverell&#x27;, the word being of Gaelic origin, and signifies &quot;meeting place of the swans&quot;; from &quot;Inbhir&quot;, a confluence, and &quot;eala&quot;, a swan. In the initial years, the local Aboriginal people resisted this occupation by spearing MacIntyre&#x27;s shepherds and taking his livestock.

Inverell is at the junction of the MacIntyre River and Swanbrook Creek and was also known as &quot;Green Swamp&quot; in the 1850s. Wheat growers, Colin and Rosanna Ross established a store there in 1853, and it was proposed that a town be surveyed. In 1858, this was done and in the following years the plan was approved and the first land sale was held. &quot;Byron&quot; Post Office (open since 1855) was replaced by the Inverell Post Office on 15 September 1859. The municipality was proclaimed in March 1872. The last section of the Inverell branchline, from Delungra to Inverell, was opened on 10 March 1902. The last train ran to Inverell on 22 June 1987, and the Delungra to Inverell section of the line was closed on 2 December 1987.

In 1871, the population of Inverell was 509, this increased to 1,212 in 1881. After Federation, the population of Inverell was 1,230 in 1911, and grew to 6,530 (1947) and 8,209 (1961 census).

=== Myall Creek Massacre ===
The massacre of at least 28 Wirrayaraay people by European convicts and settlers took place at Myall Creek near Inverell on 10 June 1838 was notable in that it was one of the very rare cases in colonial Australia for which white people were subsequently executed for the murder of Indigenous people. The crime became known as the Myall Creek Massacre. On 18 December 1838, seven men were publicly hanged at the Sydney Gaol for the atrocity.

Every year on the Sunday of the June long weekend, hundreds of people, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, gather at the Myall Creek Massacre and Memorial Site to attend an annual memorial service.

===Mining===
Diamonds were discovered at Copes Creek in 1875 and were mined at Copeton from 1883 to 1922. Commercial sapphire mining was commenced in 1919 at Frazers Creek near Inverell. Rich alluvial deposits in streams were worked initially by hand miners, but this ceased in the 1930s due to the economic effects of the Great Depression. There was little recorded production up until approximately 1960, when commercial sapphire mining resumed due to a worldwide sapphire shortage. During the 1970s there were over 100 active mining operations in the New England region, however this number declined significantly in the 1980s due to weakening demand and exhaustion of the previously rich alluvial sources. Currently there are only a small number of commercially active mines in the area.

== Heritage listings ==
Inverell has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

==Industry==
The Inverell district is in a fertile agricultural region which produces a wide range of crops, including wheat, barley, oats, sorghum, wine grapes and maize. There are also some mining activities with tin, sapphires, zircons and diamonds (mainly industrial) being found. Inverell is known as the &quot;Sapphire City&quot; because of the sapphires that have been found throughout the local district, which contributed a significant amount of Australia&#x27;s sapphire production in the 1970s.

Copeton Dam, the region&#x27;s main water supply, was completed in 1976. While being smaller than Sydney Harbour, it can hold nearly 2 times the capacity of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour). The Inland Fishing Festival is held there every year.

The highest maximum temperature recorded at Inverell was on 4 January 1903 at the Inverell Comparison site. The lowest maximum temperature for any of the Inverell weather sites was on 3 July 1984 at Inverell Research Centre. In September 1892, the town had its biggest snowfall, with falling. On 5 August 1923, snow fell in parts of the Inverell district.

<doc id="632905" wikidata="Q922208" url="?curid=632905" title="Hudson Lowe">
<text>Sir Hudson Lowe, (28 July 176910 January 1844) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of Saint Helena from 1816 to 1821. Seeing service during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, he is best known for serving as the &quot;de facto&quot; jailor of Napoleon when he was in exile on Saint Helena.

==Early life==
The son of John Lowe, an English surgeon in the British Army, he was born in County Galway, Ireland, his mother&#x27;s native country. His childhood was spent in various military outposts, particularly in the West Indies, but he was educated chiefly at Salisbury Grammar. He obtained a post as ensign in the East Devon Militia when he was eleven. In 1787 he entered his father&#x27;s regiment, the 50th Foot, which was then serving at Gibraltar under Governor-General Charles O&#x27;Hara. In 1791, he was promoted to Lieutenant. The same year he was granted eighteen months&#x27; leave, and chose to spend the time travelling through Italy rather than return to Britain. He chose to avoid travelling to France because the French Revolution had recently broken out.

==Career==

===Corsica===
Lowe arrived back at Gibraltar shortly after the outbreak of war between Britain and France in early 1793. The 50th were sent to take part in the Defence of Toulon which had been seized by an Allied force under Lord Hood after an invitation by French Royalists in the city. The 50th arrived too late to assist the defence, as the Allied forces had already withdrawn from the city. They were then redirected to Corsica, a French-owned island, where British troops had been sent to join with Corsicans under Pasquale Paoli. Lowe&#x27;s regiment served as part of General Dundas&#x27;s force during the Siege of Bastia and Siege of Calvi driving the French from the island. The regiment was stationed in Bastia. Lowe volunteered to fetch supplies from Livorno in Italy, but nearly died of malaria during the journey there.

When he recovered, Lowe returned to Corsica, and was stationed in the citadel at Ajaccio as an aide to the Governor, Colonel Wauchope, close to where Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s sisters had recently been living before they fled to mainland France. In October 1796 it was decided to abandon Corsica and the force at Ajaccio was embarked and taken to Elba. The following year Elba was also abandoned and Lowe was evacuated with his regiment first to Gibraltar and then to Lisbon. He spent the next two years as part of a British force which was placed to deter an invasion by French and Spanish forces.

Lowe later saw active service successively in Elba, Portugal, and Menorca, where he was entrusted with the command of a battalion of volunteer Corsican exiles in the British Army, the Royal Corsican Rangers, who were armed with Baker rifles and trained as light infantry. In Corsica he was actually billeted in the &quot;Casa Buonaparte&quot;. He led the Corsican Rangers in Egypt in 1800–1801.

===Napoleonic Wars===
After the peace of Amiens, Lowe, now a Major, became assistant quartermaster-general. On the renewal of war with France in 1803, he was charged, as a lieutenant-colonel, to raise the Corsican battalion again and with it assisted in the defense of Sicily. On the capture of Capri, he proceeded there with his battalion and a Maltese regiment; but in October 1808, Joachim Murat ordered an attack upon the island, which was organized by General Lamarque. Lowe, owing to the unreliability of the Maltese troops and no hope of help by sea, had to agree to evacuate the island. Sir William Napier criticized him, but his garrison consisted of only 1,362 men, while the assailants numbered between 3,000 and 4,000.

In the course of 1809, Lowe and his Corsicans helped in the capture of Ischia and Procida, as well as of Zante, Cephalonia and Cerigo. For some months, he acted as governor of Cephalonia and Ithaca, and later of Santa Maura. He returned to Britain in 1812, and in January 1813, was sent to inspect a Russo-German legion then being formed. He accompanied the armies of the allies through the campaigns of 1813 and 1814, being present at thirteen important battles. He won praise from Blücher and Gneisenau for his gallantry and judgment, and was chosen to bear to London the news of the first abdication of Napoleon in April 1814.

Lowe was knighted and promoted to major-general; he also received decorations from the Russian and Prussian courts. Charged with the duties of quartermaster-general of the army in the Netherlands in 1814–1815, he was about to take part in the Belgian campaign when he was offered the command of the British troops at Genoa; but while still in the south of France, on 1 August 1815 he received news of his appointment to the position of custodian of Napoleon, Emperor of the French, who had surrendered to Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland on board HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; off Rochefort. Lowe was to be Governor of Saint Helena, the place of the former Emperor&#x27;s exile.
At the time of Lowe&#x27;s appointment, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Lord Bathurst, wrote to Wellington:I do not believe we could have found a fitter person of his rank in the army willing to accept a situation of so much confinement, responsibility and exclusion from society.

===Saint Helena===

On his arrival at Plantation House, he found that Napoleon had an uneasy relationship with Admiral Sir George Cockburn, who had been responsible for conveying Napoleon to St. Helena, and was in charge of him pending the arrival of a new Governor. Napoleon and Governor Lowe had a stormy relationship, and only met half a dozen times. To a large extent, Lowe&#x27;s hands were tied by his instructions from The 3rd Earl Bathurst, but Lowe&#x27;s characteristic lack of tact doubtless exacerbated the friction between them.

The news that rescue-expeditions were being planned by Bonapartists in the United States led to the enforcement of stricter regulations in October 1816. Lowe ordered sentries to be posted round the garden of Napoleon&#x27;s residence, Longwood House, at sunset instead of at 9 p.m. He assigned a British officer the task of catching sight of Napoleon every day. Lowe created a set of petty rules that included restricting Napoleon to the Longwood Estate and requiring that the British not address Napoleon by his Imperial titles but only as a general. He demanded that Napoleon pay for part of his imprisonment, so Napoleon offered up some Imperial silver for sale. This created such a backlash in Europe that the demand had to be cancelled. Then he reduced the amount of firewood for Longwood. News that Napoleon was burning his furniture to stay warm again caused such a backlash of public sympathy that the supply of firewood was restored.

All of this and more offended Napoleon and his followers, who campaigned against Lowe. Barry Edward O&#x27;Meara, the Irish surgeon, while initially providing information for Lowe, ultimately sided with Napoleon, and joined in criticisms from Las Cases and Montholon. The French, Russian and Austrian commissioners on St. Helena, while hostile to Napoleon, were also very critical of Lowe&#x27;s conduct and found it impossible to get on with him.

In addition, modern scholars have debated Lowe&#x27;s role in Napoleon&#x27;s death. Lowe&#x27;s restriction of the former Emperor of the French to what amounted to house arrest rather than simply exile certainly affected Napoleon&#x27;s ability to exercise and his general health. Some sources have gone so far as to suggest that Lowe may have had him poisoned. Napoleon himself claimed just three weeks before his death that he had been &quot;murdered by the English oligarchy and its hired assassin&quot;. However, an autopsy conducted after his death concluded that Napoleon died from natural causes, specifically complications arising from &quot;stomach cancer&quot;.

After the death of the Emperor Napoleon in May 1821, Lowe returned to England. On the publication of O&#x27;Meara&#x27;s book, Lowe resolved to prosecute the author, but his application was too late. Ironically, O&#x27;Meara&#x27;s book was softer on Lowe than what the doctor really thought of him and of his role as &quot;executioner&quot; at St. Helena. His true attitudes are revealed in the letters he passed clandestinely to a clerk at the Admiralty.

Apart from the thanks of George IV, at a levee, he received little reward from the British Government, whose orders he had obeyed to the letter. His treatment of Napoleon and the subsequent public relations problems for the British Government remained an underlying issue for the rest of his career. Field Marshal The Duke of Wellington later said that Lowe was &quot;a very bad choice; he was a man wanting in education and judgment. He was a stupid man. He knew nothing at all of the world, and like all men who knew nothing of the world, he was suspicious and jealous.&quot;

One of Lowe&#x27;s lesser-known accomplishments was his contribution to the abolition of slavery on the island of St. Helena.

===After Saint Helena===

In June 1822 he was appointed Colonel in Chief of the Sutherland Highlanders in place of Sir Thomas Hislop.

In 1825–30, he commanded the forces in Ceylon but was not appointed to the Governorship when it became vacant in 1830. He was appointed to the colonelcy of the 56th (West Essex) Regiment of Foot in 1831, and in 1842 transferred to the colonelcy of his old regiment, the 50th (Queen&#x27;s Own) Regiment of Foot. He was also made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

Lowe died at Charlotte Cottage, near Sloane Street, Chelsea, of paralysis, on 10 Jan. 1844, aged 74.

==Family==
In London on 30 December 1815 Lowe married Susan Johnson, daughter of Stephen De Lancey, sister of William Howe De Lancey, and widow of Colonel William Johnson. She had previously had two daughters, one of whom had died, and the other married Count Balmain. They had five children, two sons, Hudson Lowe, born in 1816, and Edward William Howe de Lancey Lowe, born in 1820, and three daughters, Camilla, Francis, Clara Maria Susanna Lowe, born on 26 August 1818. Lady Lowe died in Hertford Street, Mayfair, London, on 22 August 1832.

==Portrayals in fiction==
Sir Hudson Lowe was portrayed by Orson Welles in Sacha Guitry&#x27;s film &quot;Napoléon&quot; (1955), by Ralph Richardson in &quot;Eagle in a Cage&quot; (1972), by Vernon Dobtcheff in &quot;L&#x27;Otage de l&#x27;Europe&quot; (1989), by David Francis in the Napoleon miniseries (2002), and by Richard E. Grant in &quot;Monsieur N.&quot; (2003). He appears in the play &quot;La Dernière Salve&quot; by Jean-Claude Brisville (1995). He is a character in Tom Keneally’s book &quot;Napoleon’s Last Island&quot; (2015).

<doc id="632910" wikidata="Q1136948" url="?curid=632910" title="Landing platform helicopter">
<text>Landing platform helicopter (LPH) is a term used by some navies to denote a type of amphibious warfare ship designed primarily to operate as a launch and recovery platform for helicopters and other VTOL aircraft. As such, they are considered a type of helicopter carrier.

Under the NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) document for reporting vessels, LPH is a short form designator used for &quot;Amphibious Assault Ship, Helicopter&quot; defined as a &quot;large helicopter carrier&quot; for carrying and deploying around 1,800 assault troops using its own aircraft, but for which use of landing craft is &quot;not a principal function&quot;. For ships of this hull classification in the Royal Navy, LPH is a direct acronym for &quot;Landing Platform Helicopter&quot;, while the United States Navy referred to its vessels within this classification as &quot;Landing ship, Personnel, Helicopter&quot;, and after 2006 as &quot;amphibious assault ships&quot;. The etymology is L for amphibious, P for transport, and H for helicopter. Regardless of the terminology, all vessels classified as an LPH possess essentially similar capabilities.

The Royal Navy also used the term &quot;Commando Carrier&quot;, which it applied to aircraft carriers converted to helicopter only operations. Prior to selling the vessel to the Brazilian Navy in 2018, the RN operated as an LPH. Following the British government&#x27;s decision to withdraw its Harrier aircraft at the end of 2010, the former light fleet carrier also performed this role until decommissioning in 2014.

The LPH classification was used by the U.S. Navy for the amphibious assault ships of the , a converted and three converted s. No ships of this classification are currently in active service with the U.S. Navy, having been replaced with multi-purpose ships classified under NATO naming conventions as landing helicopter dock or landing helicopter assault ships.

<text>RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta (; &quot;Radio of the Gaeltacht&quot;), abbreviated RnaG, is an Irish language radio station owned and operated by Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ). The station is available on FM in Ireland and via satellite and on the internet. In 2022, Raidio na Gaeltachta celebrated its 50th year in broadcasting. The station&#x27;s main-headquarters are in Casla, County Galway with major studios also in Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal and Ballydavid, County Kerry.

==History==
===Background===
After the Irish Free State was formed and the Irish Civil War was concluded, the new state set up a single radio channel named 2RN in 1926, launched by Douglas Hyde. This was run by the Irish Post Office and was not a private enterprise. The radio program, operating out of Dublin, largely served the Anglophone population and at best reached as far as County Tipperary; a situation which did not change until more powerful transmitters were adopted in the 1930s at Athlone. Those involved in setting up 2RN and J. J. Walsh (Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1923 to 1927) discussed the possibility of setting up an Irish-language radio service for the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; community and more widely were sympathetic to Irish culture which included language revival, but the project was frustrated due to economic reasons and came to little. 

As the Irish language was valued as part of Irish national identity and a marker of the young state&#x27;s independence, there were some broadcasts in the language such as &quot;Nuacht&quot; and &quot;Tréimhseachán Teann&quot; (shows with English equivalents), the latter written by Séamus Ó Néill and Ciarán Ó Nualláin (brother of Brian Ó Nualláin). These featured alongside focus on Gaelic games, Irish traditional music and Catholic religious programming as part of a general nation-building content focus. In the 1940s, there were shows which sought to proactively teach the language such as &quot;Is Your Irish Rusty?&quot; and &quot;Listen and Learn&quot;. Irish-language programming suffered from a shortage of materials and for audience figures. In 1943, Taoiseach Éamon de Valera – whose wife Sinéad Ní Fhlannagáin was a keen &quot;Conradh na Gaeilge&quot; activist – promoted the idea of a &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; station again, but there was no breakthrough. By this time, 2RN had become &quot;Radio Éireann&quot; and still only had one channel, with limited broadcasting hours, often in competition for listeners with BBC Radio and Radio Luxembourg.

In the 1950s, a general liberalisation and commercialisation, indeed Americanisation began to occur in Ireland, as a push was made to move Ireland from a rural-agrarian society with a protectionist cultural policy, towards a market economy basis, with supply and demand the primarily basis of public communications. This brought Ireland into line culturally with the Western powers and eventually paved the way for its entrance into the European Economic Community. In 1960, RTÉ was established and direct control of communications moved from a government ministry position to a non-governmental RTÉ Director-General position, first filled by the American, Edward Roth. Previous cultural policies, including broadcasting in Irish, reduced in percentage, as ratings and profit became key. Eventually, in the late 1960s, a civil rights movement in the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;, particularly Conamara emerged, seeking development and services for Irish-speakers, including a radio service. Out of the &#x27;s advocacy came the pirate radio station &quot;Saor Raidió Chonamara&quot; in 1970. This set the subsequent discourse for Irish-language and &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; issues as a civil rights and minority rights imperative.

===Foundation===

Gerry Collins, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, announced in the &quot;Dáil&quot; in February 1971 that a new radio station for the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; would be created. &quot;Raidió na Gaeltachta&quot; began broadcasting at 3pm on 2 April 1972 as part of Easter Sunday programming. During the very first broadcast, the main station at Casla, County Galway was not yet finished and the studios in County Kerry and County Donegal were still in construction, so it was broadcast from Galway. The first &quot;Ceannaire&quot; (Controller) Pádraic Ó Raghallaigh opened the show, which was followed by a recording from President Éamon de Valera. A recording of Seán Ó Riada&#x27;s Irish-language Mass, &quot;Ceol an Aifrinn&quot; (which includes the hymn &quot;Ag Críost an Síol&quot;) from the &quot;Seipéal Mhic Dara&quot; at Carraroe was also played.

At foundation, the station began with a staff of seven, including six former teachers and a businessman: Ó Raghallaigh, Breandán Feiritéar, Timlín Ó Cearnaigh, Máirtín Ó Fátharta, Seán Ó Tuairisg, Maidhc P. Ó Conaola, Mícheál Ó Sé and Feardorcha Ó Colla. Initially, &quot;Raidió na Gaeltachta&quot; broadcast for only two hours a day and was only available in or near the three largest &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; districts. The local studio at Derrybeg in Gweedore, County Donegal, under the direction of Ulstermen, Ó Cearnaigh and Ó Colla, aided the native Irish music scene there. In the 1970s, &quot;Raidió na Gaeltachta&quot; gave early coverage to Clannad and Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh (later the singer for Altan). These groups would gain popularity not only in Ireland, but on the international stage, selling millions of records during the 1980s especially. The station was dedicated to bringing the listener general news, both national and international (which, in the context of the times meant Donegal reporters with Gaelic names having to cross British Army checkpoints into Northern Ireland), as well as Gaelic sports coverage and more localised affairs of significance to the community in the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;.

===21st century===
Following the putting in place of a fourth RTÉ national radio transmitter network (used for RTÉ lyric fm), the station expanded to 24 hours from 1 October 2001. Listenership figures are hard to come by, as the station does not make payments to be included covered in the JNLR listenership survey. It is claimed that – as it doesn&#x27;t carry advertising (the only Irish radio station not to do so) – paying to be included in a survey organised mainly for the benefit of the Irish advertising industry would be a waste of scarce funds. It is generally believed that listenership is high amongst fluent Irish speakers but its appeal among those learning the language is not as high as TG4 because (despite being available nationally) it is widely perceived as being oriented (as its name suggests) towards Gaeltacht residents.

For many years, Raidió na Gaeltachta was the only Irish-language broadcaster in the country; from the 1990s, it was joined by a television service, Telefís na Gaeilge (now known as TG4), and by regional community radio stations: Raidió na Life in Dublin, Raidió Fáilte in Belfast and Raidió Rí-Rá.

====English-language music====
In March 2005, RTÉ announced that RnaG would allow songs with English lyrics to be played between 21:00 and 01:00, as part of a new popular music strand. In April 2005, it was announced that the name of this strand would be (). On weeknights the strand includes a new programme, (), as well as the existing long-running slot. The new service was launched on 2 May 2005. The first track with English-language lyrics played was &quot;Blister in the Sun&quot; by the Violent Femmes, chosen by public vote.

====Pay parity====
On 12 July 2024, staff at RTÉ Raidio na Gaeltachta won the right to pay parity with journalists working through the medium of the English language in Ireland. The development follows a long running campaign by the NUJ, SIPTU and the RTÉ Group of Unions and is in line with the recommendations in the report by the Expert Advisory Committee on Contractor Fees, HR and other matters, the report by the Joint Oireachtas Media Committee and the report of the Future of Media Commission. 
After campaigning for several years for pay parity with equivalent posts working within the English language, the three Irish language grades at Raidio na Gaeltacha will be moved in line with their counterparts in the English language grades.
These three Irish language job grades are: &quot;Clár Reachtaire&quot;, &quot;Reachtaire Rúnaíochta&quot; Grade 1 and &quot;Reachtaire Rúnaíochta&quot; Grade 2, and the National Union of Journalists press release on the matter notes that the job grades combine a range of journalistic and production skills and that they differ only in title from their equivalents working through English.

==Locations==
RnaG is based in Casla, County Galway. It also has studios at Gaoth Dobhair (&quot;Gweedore&quot;), County Donegal; Baile na nGall in Ard na Caithne, County Kerry; Castlebar, County Mayo; with a smaller studio in Ring, County Waterford and the RTÉ Radio Centre in Dublin. The station is operated by RTÉ, but has a separate advisory council, Comhairle Raidió na Gaeltachta, which is appointed by the RTÉ Authority. RTÉ also appoints the Ceannaire, or Controller, of RnaG, who has day-to-day responsibility for the service.

==Notable presenters==
==Audience==
According to the 2011 JNLR survey, RnaG then had a weekly listenership of 100,000 which equates to a 3% market share. This is similar to Welsh-language BBC Radio Cymru, with 116,000 listeners and a 2.4% share.

<text>Julia Babette Sarah Neuberger, Baroness Neuberger, (; born 27 February 1950) is a British rabbi and politician. She was the second woman to be ordained as a rabbi in the UK and the first to lead a synagogue.

Neuberger was made a life peer in 2004. In the House of Lords she took the Liberal Democrat whip until 2011 when she became a crossbencher upon becoming the full-time senior rabbi of the West London Synagogue, from which she retired in 2020. She became the chair of University College London Hospitals (UCLH) in 2019.

==Early life==
Neuberger was born Julia Babette Sarah Schwab in the Hampstead area of London on 27 February 1950, the daughter of art critic Liesel (&quot;Alice&quot;) and civil servant Walter Schwab. Her mother was a German-Jewish refugee who had fled the Nazis, arriving in England at the age of 22 in 1937, while her father was born in England to German-Jewish immigrants who had settled there before the First World War. The Schwab Trust, which supports and educates young refugees and asylum seekers, was later set up in her parents&#x27; name.

She attended South Hampstead High School and Newnham College, Cambridge, where she first studied Assyriology. After she was refused entry to Turkey because she was British, and then to Iraq because she was Jewish, she had to change her subject and instead studied her second language of Hebrew full-time. Her lecturer at the University of Cambridge, Nicholas de Lange, suggested she should become a rabbi. She obtained her rabbinic diploma at Leo Baeck College. She was the second woman to be ordained as a rabbi in the UK, the first being Jackie Tabick in 1975.

==Career==
===Religious roles===
Neuberger taught at her alma mater, Leo Baeck College, from 1977 to 1997. She was rabbi of the South London Liberal Synagogue from 1977 to 1989 and was the first female rabbi to lead a synagogue in the United Kingdom. She was president of West Central Liberal Synagogue. On 1 February 2011, the West London Synagogue (a Movement for Reform Judaism synagogue) announced that she had been appointed as senior rabbi of the synagogue. She retired from her West London Synagogue role in March 2020. She regularly appeared on the &quot;Pause for Thought&quot; section on BBC Radio 2.

===Public sector activity===
Neuberger was chair of Camden and Islington Community Health Services NHS Trust from 1992 to 1997, and chief executive of the King&#x27;s Fund from 1997 to 2004. She was also chancellor of the University of Ulster from 1994 to 2000. &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; lists a large number of voluntary and philanthropic roles she has undertaken. She became the chair of University College London Hospitals (UCLH) in 2019.

Her book, &quot;The Moral State We&#x27;re In&quot;, a study of morality and public policy in modern Britain (), was published in 2005. The title is an allusion to Will Hutton&#x27;s 1997 book, &quot;The State We&#x27;re In&quot;.

===Political and parliamentary roles===
Neuberger was the Social Democratic Party candidate for Tooting in the 1983 general election, coming third with 8,317 votes (18.1%). She was appointed a DBE in the 2004 New Year Honours for &quot;services to the NHS and other Public Bodies&quot;. In June 2004, she was created a life peer as Baroness Neuberger, of Primrose Hill in the London Borough of Camden. She served as a Liberal Democrat Health spokesperson from 2004 to 2007. On 29 June 2007, Neuberger was appointed by the incoming Prime Minister Gordon Brown as the government&#x27;s champion of volunteering. She resigned the Liberal Democrat whip in September 2011 upon becoming senior rabbi of the West London Synagogue.

==Controversy==
In 1997, Neuberger criticised education in Northern Ireland as &quot;sectarian&quot; at the opening of Loughview Integrated Primary School. The &quot;Irish News&quot; claimed she had criticised Catholic schools as sectarian, leading to criticism from the Director of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools. However, she said that the report from the &quot;Irish News&quot; had given a misleading impression and that she had been quoted out of context: &quot;In fact, I think in what I actually said at the opening I didn&#x27;t mention Catholic schools. I think I actually mentioned Protestant, Muslim and Jewish but then I was interviewed afterwards and I certainly said to the reporter that what I said applied just as much to Catholic schools as to Protestant or Jewish or Muslim or whatever.&quot;

==Charity work ==
In January 2013, Neuberger was appointed chair of an Independent Review of the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient. The impartiality of the appointment was questioned by some of the bereaved families, due to her previous endorsement of the pathway, which was written by John Ellershaw, medical director of the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute in Liverpool, in a 2003 &quot;BMJ&quot; article, and her widely publicised support of the Marie Curie Institute. The results of the review were published in July 2013; accepting the review&#x27;s recommendations, the government advised that NHS hospitals should phase out the use of the LCP.

Neuberger was elected vice-president of Attend, a charity that supports and expands the roles volunteers play in creating healthy communities, in 2006 and held the position until she retired in 2011.

Neuberger was appointed to the board of Irish health insurers Vhi Healthcare for a five-year period from 2005 by Mary Harney, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children.

Neuberger is a vice president of the Jewish Leadership Council.

==Personal life==
Neuberger married Professor Anthony Neuberger on 17 September 1973. They have a son named Matthew and a daughter named Harriet. Her brother-in-law is David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury.

In the wake of the Brexit vote in 2016, Neuberger stated that she would apply for a German passport, for which she is eligible through her parents. She said, &quot;My decision has nothing at all to do with anti-Semitism, but with my origins, my admiration for how today&#x27;s Germany has dealt with its past, and my sense of being European as well as British.&quot;

<doc id="632918" wikidata="Q794679" url="?curid=632918" title="Bifid cipher">
<text>In classical cryptography, the bifid cipher is a cipher which combines the Polybius square with transposition, and uses fractionation to achieve diffusion. It was invented around 1901 by Felix Delastelle.

== Operation ==
First, a mixed alphabet Polybius square is drawn up, where the I and the J share their position:
 1 2 3 4 5
 1 B G W K Z
 2 Q P N D S
 3 I O A X E
 4 F C L U M
 5 T H Y V R
The message is converted to its coordinates in the usual manner, but they are written vertically beneath:
 F L E E A T O N C E
 4 4 3 3 3 5 3 2 4 3
 1 3 5 5 3 1 2 3 2 5
They are then read out in rows:
 4 4 3 3 3 5 3 2 4 3 1 3 5 5 3 1 2 3 2 5
Then divided up into pairs again, and the pairs turned back into letters using the square:
 44 33 35 32 43 13 55 31 23 25
 U A E O L W R I N S
In this way, each ciphertext character depends on two plaintext characters, so the bifid is a digraphic cipher, like the Playfair cipher. To decrypt, the procedure is simply reversed.

Longer messages are first broken up into blocks of fixed length, called the period, and the above
encryption procedure is applied to each block. One way to detect the period uses bigram statistics on ciphertext letters separated by half the period. For even periods, &quot;p&quot;, as in the example above (p=10), ciphertext letters at a distance of &quot;p/2&quot; are influenced by &quot;two&quot; plaintext letters (e. g., U and W are influenced by F and L), but for odd periods, &quot;p&quot;, ciphertext letters at distances of &quot;p/2&quot; (rounded either up or down) are influenced by &quot;three&quot; plaintext letters. Thus, odd periods are more secure than even against this form of cryptanalysis, because it would require more text to find a statistical anomaly in trigram plaintext statistics than bigram plaintext statistics.

<text>Whit Taylor (born January 8, 1960) is a former college and professional football quarterback. He was an all-Southeastern Conference quarterback for Vanderbilt University from 1979–1982, a period which included a trip to the 1982 Hall of Fame Bowl. His career at Vanderbilt led in 2003 to his recognition as an SEC Football Legend.

After attempting a career in the National Football League (NFL), he became a backup quarterback for the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League (USFL) and then became quarterback of the Denver Dynamite of the Arena Football League (AFL) in 1987. In that year he became the first player ever to pass for ten touchdowns in any professional game of American football, a record which stood for over a decade.

Taylor was a principal at Shelbyville Central High School. He is now a vice principal at a local elementary school.

== Biography ==
===Professional career===
In 1987, Taylor lead the Denver Dynamite to a 45–16 victory over the Pittsburgh Gladiators in ArenaBowl I. Taylor threw four touchdowns during the game, three of them to future Arena Football Hall of Famer Gary Mullen.

===After football===
Taylor got his start in coaching at the collegiate level, serving as quarterbacks coach at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 1988–1989. He worked as a high school football coach and teacher in the Middle Tennessee area at Shelbyville&#x27;s Central High School, his high school alma mater.

In 2006, he left coaching to go into educational administration. He served as the Harris Middle School Assistant Principal for a few years. He was the Principal of Shelbyville Central High School. He was the vice principal of Eastside Elementary. Whit has now retired from his education career starting in the 2020–2021 school year

<doc id="632922" wikidata="Q2064997" url="?curid=632922" title="Sex-positive feminism">
<text>Sex-positive feminism, also known as pro-sex feminism, sex-radical feminism, or sexually liberal feminism, is a feminist movement centering on the idea that sexual freedom is an essential component of women&#x27;s freedom. They oppose legal or social efforts to control sexual activities between consenting adults, whether they are initiated by the government, other feminists, opponents of feminism, or any other institution. They embrace sexual minority groups, endorsing the value of coalition-building with marginalized groups. Sex-positive feminism is connected with the sex-positive movement. Sex-positive feminism brings together anti-censorship activists, LGBT activists, feminist scholars, producers of pornography and erotica, among others. Sex-positive feminists believe that prostitution can be a positive experience if workers are treated with respect, and agree that sex work should not be criminalized.

== Key ideas ==

Gayle Rubin summarizes the conflict over sex within feminism. She says that one feminist stream criticizes the sexual constraints and difficulties faced by sexually active women (e.g., access to abortion), while another stream views sexual liberalization as an extension of &quot;male privilege&quot;.

Sex-positive feminists reject the vilification of male sexuality that many attribute to radical feminism, and instead embrace the entire range of human sexuality. They argue that the patriarchy limits sexual expression and are in favor of giving people of all genders more sexual opportunities, rather than restricting pornography. Sex-positive feminists generally reject sexual essentialism, defined by Rubin as &quot;the idea that sex is a natural force that exists prior to social life and shapes institutions&quot;. Rather, they see sexual orientation and gender as social constructs that are heavily influenced by society.

Some radical feminists reject the dichotomy of &quot;sex-positive&quot; and &quot;sex-negative&quot; feminism, suggesting that instead, the real divide is between liberal feminism and radical feminism.

Sex-radical feminists in particular, come to a sex-positive stance from a deep distrust in the patriarchy&#x27;s ability to secure women&#x27;s best interest in sexually limiting laws. Other feminists identify women&#x27;s sexual liberation as the real motive behind the women&#x27;s movement. Naomi Wolf writes, &quot;Orgasm is the body&#x27;s natural call to feminist politics.&quot; Sharon Presley, the National Coordinator of the Association of Libertarian Feminists, writes that in the area of sexuality, government blatantly discriminates against women.

The social background in which sex-positive feminism operates must also be understood: Christian societies are often influenced by what is understood as &#x27;traditional&#x27; sexual morality: according to the Christian doctrine, sexual activity must only take place in marriage, and must be vaginal intercourse; sexual acts outside marriage and &#x27;unnatural sex&#x27; (i.e. oral, anal sex, termed as &quot;sodomy&quot;) are forbidden; yet forced sexual intercourse within marriage is not seen as immoral by a few social and religious conservatives, owing to the existence of so-called &#x27;conjugal rights&#x27; defined in the Bible at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5.

Such organization of sexuality has increasingly come under legal and social attack in recent decades.

In addition, in certain cultures, particularly in Mediterranean countries influenced by Roman Catholicism, traditional ideas of masculinity and female purity are still influential. This has led to what many interpret as a double standard between male and female sexuality; men are expected to be sexually assertive as a way of affirming their masculinity, but for a woman to be considered &#x27;good&#x27;, she must remain pure. Indeed, Cesare Lombroso claimed in his book, &quot;The Female Offender&quot;, that women could be categorized into three types: the &quot;Criminal Woman&quot;, the &quot;Prostitute&quot;, and the &quot;Normal Woman&quot;. As such, highly sexed women (prostitutes) were deemed as abnormal.

Feminists &quot;ranging from Betty Friedan and Kate Millett to Karen DeCrow, Wendy Kaminer and Jamaica Kincaid&quot; supported the right to consume pornography. Feminists who have advocated a sex-positive position include writer Kathy Acker, academic Camille Paglia, sex educator Megan Andelloux, Susie Bright, Rachel Kramer Bussel, Diana Cage, Avedon Carol, Patrick Califia, Betty Dodson, Nancy Friday, Jane Gallop, Laci Green, porn performer Nina Hartley, Josephine Ho, Amber L. Hollibaugh, Brenda Howard, Laura Kipnis, Wendy McElroy, Inga Muscio, Joan Nestle, Marcia Pally, Carol Queen, Candida Royalle, Gayle Rubin, Annie Sprinkle, Tristan Taormino, Ellen Willis, and Mireille Miller- Young.

=== Sex positivity ===
According to sexologist and author Carol Queen, in an interview with researcher and professor Lynn Comella, &quot;[sex positivity] is the cultural philosophy that understands sexuality as a potentially positive force in one&#x27;s life, and it can be [...] contrasted with sex-negativity, which sees sex as problematic, disruptive, dangerous. Sex-positivity allows for and [...] celebrates sexual diversity, differing desires and relationships structures, and individual choices based on consent... [negative sexual experiences caused by lack of information, support, and choices] are the cultural conditions that sex-positivity allows us to point out as curtailers of healthy, enjoyable sexual experience.&quot;

Queen also added, &quot;This sense that many of us were being denied space and credentials to speak for ourselves and speak about issues within our community is what [...] led to the efflorescence of sex-positive feminism. And it is why there is a sex-positive &quot;feminism&quot; and not just sex-positivity.&quot;

== Historical roots ==
Authors such as Gayle Rubin and Wendy McElroy see the roots of sex-positive feminism stemming from the work of sex reformers and workers for sex education and access to contraception, such as Havelock Ellis, Margaret Sanger, Mary Dennett and, later, Alfred Kinsey and Shere Hite. However, the contemporary incarnation of sex-positive feminism appeared more recently, following an increasing feminist focus on pornography as a source of women&#x27;s oppression in the 1970s.

The rise of second-wave feminism was concurrent with the sexual revolution and rulings that loosened legal restrictions on access to pornography. In the 1970s, radical feminists became increasingly focused on issues around sexuality in a patriarchal society. Some feminist groups began to concern themselves with prescribing what proper feminist sexuality should look like. This was especially characteristic of lesbian separatist groups, but some heterosexual women&#x27;s groups, such as Redstockings, became engaged with this issue as well. On the other hand, there were also feminists, such as Betty Dodson, who saw women&#x27;s sexual pleasure and masturbation as central to women&#x27;s liberation. Pornography was not a major issue during this era; radical feminists were generally opposed to pornography, but the issue was not treated as especially important until the mid-1970s.

There were, however, feminist prostitutes-rights advocates, such as COYOTE, which campaigned for the decriminalization of prostitution.

The late 1970s found American culture becoming increasingly concerned about the aftermath of a decade of greater sexual freedom, including concerns about explicit violent and sexual imagery in the media, the mainstreaming of pornography, increased sexual activity among teenagers, and issues such as the dissemination of child pornography and the purported rise of &quot;snuff films&quot;. (Critics maintain that this atmosphere amounted to a moral panic, which reached its peak in the mid-1980s.). These concerns were reflected in the feminist movement, with radical feminist groups claiming that pornography was a central underpinning of patriarchy and a direct cause of violence against women. Robin Morgan summarized this idea in her statement, &quot;Pornography is the theory; rape the practice.&quot;

Andrea Dworkin and Robin Morgan began articulating a vehemently anti-porn stance based in radical feminism beginning in 1974, and anti-porn feminist groups, such as Women Against Pornography and similar organizations, became highly active in various US cities during the late 1970s. As anti-porn feminists broadened their criticism and activism to include not only pornography, but prostitution and sadomasochism, other feminists became concerned about the direction the movement was taking and grew more critical of anti-porn feminism.

This included feminist BDSM practitioners (notably Samois), prostitutes-rights advocates, and many liberal and anti-authoritarian feminists for whom free speech, sexual freedom, and advocacy of women&#x27;s agency were central concerns.

One of the earliest feminist arguments against this anti-pornography trend amongst feminists was Ellen Willis&#x27;s essay &quot;Feminism, Moralism, and Pornography&quot; first published in October 1979 in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. In response to the formation of Women Against Pornography in 1979, Willis wrote an article (the origin of the term, &quot;pro-sex feminism&quot;), expressing worries about anti-pornography feminists&#x27; attempts to make feminism into a single-issue movement, arguing that feminists should not issue a blanket condemnation against all pornography and that restrictions on pornography could just as easily be applied to speech that feminists found favorable to themselves.

Rubin calls for a new feminist theory of sex, saying that existing feminist thoughts on sex had frequently considered sexual liberalization as a trend that only increases male privilege. Rubin criticizes anti-pornography feminists who she claims &quot;have condemned virtually every variant of sexual expression as anti-feminist,&quot; arguing that their view of sexuality is dangerously close to anti-feminist, conservative sexual morality. Rubin encourages feminists to consider the political aspects of sexuality without promoting sexual repression. She also argues that the blame for women&#x27;s oppression should be put on targets who deserve it: &quot;the family, religion, education, child-rearing practices, the media, the state, psychiatry, job discrimination, and unequal pay...&quot; rather than on relatively un-influential sexual minorities.

McElroy (1995) argues that for feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, turning to matters of sexual expression was a result of frustration with feminism&#x27;s apparent failure to achieve success through political channels: in the United States, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) had failed, and abortion rights came under attack during the Reagan administration.

Scholar Elaine Jeffreys observes that the &#x27;anti-prostitute&#x27; position gained increased critical purchase in China during the establishment of the international movement for prostitutes in 1985, demanding recognition of prostitutes&#x27; rights as an emancipation and labor issue rather than of criminality, immorality or disease.

In her 1992 book, &quot;Sexual Reality: A Virtual Sex World Reader&quot;, sex-positive feminist Susie Bright dedicated a chapter to a salon gathering she co-hosted with fellow feminists Laura Miller, Amy Wallace, and Lisa Palac at Wallace&#x27;s Berkeley Hills mansion, attended by 16 women writers and served by fully nude men they called &quot;slaveboys&quot;. The hosts had advertised for &quot;slaveboys&quot; in the &quot;San Francisco Weekly&quot;, stating, &quot;Genteel and Bohemian gathering of women writers requires comely slaveboys to serve at our tea party. You will serve nude and will not speak unless spoken to. [...]&quot;. The ad received about 100 responses, from which six were selected after &quot;nude auditions&quot;. The &quot;slaveboys&quot; served tea and meals, provided foot massages, polished nails, brushed hair, tended the fire, and posed for photographs with the guests. Bright also addresses criticism from unattended friends who called the setup &quot;reverse sexism&quot;, to which she responded unapologetically, adding a note of regret for not having sex with them.

By the 2000s, the positive-sex position had driven various international human rights NGOs to actively pressure the Chinese government to abandon its official policy of banning prostitution in post-reform China and recognize voluntary prostitution as legitimate work.

== Related major political issues ==

===Pornography===

The issue of pornography was perhaps the first issue to unite sex-positive feminists, though current sex-positive views on the subject are wide-ranging and complex. During the 1980s, Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, as well as activists inspired by their writings, worked in favor of anti-pornography ordinances in a number of U.S. cities, as well as in Canada. The first such ordinance was passed by the city council in Minneapolis in 1983. MacKinnon and Dworkin took the tactic of framing pornography as a civil rights issue, arguing that showing pornography constituted sex discrimination against women. The sex-positive movement response to this argument was that legislation against pornography violates women&#x27;s right to free speech. Soon after, a coalition of anti-porn feminists and right-wing groups succeeded in passing a similar ordinance in Indianapolis. This ordinance was later declared unconstitutional by a Federal court in &quot;American Booksellers v. Hudnut&quot;.

Rubin writes that anti-pornography feminists exaggerate the dangers of pornography by showing the most shocking pornographic images (such as those associated with sadomasochism) out of context, in a way that implies that the women depicted are actually being raped, rather than emphasizing that these scenes depict fantasies and use actors who have consented to be shown in such a way. Sex-positive feminists argue that access to pornography is as important to women as to men and that there is nothing inherently degrading to women about pornography. However, anti-pornography feminists disagree, often arguing that the very depiction of such acts leads to the actual acts being encouraged and committed.

Feminist curators such as Jasmin Hagendorfer organize feminist and queer porn film festivals (e.g. &quot;PFFV&quot; in Vienna).

===Prostitution and sex workers===

Some sex-positive feminists believe that women and men can have positive experiences as sex workers and that where it is illegal, prostitution should be decriminalized. They argue that prostitution is not necessarily bad for women if prostitutes are treated with respect and if the professions within sex work are destigmatized.

Sex workers are adults who receive money (or other goods) in exchange for consensual sexual services. In the United States, sex work is legal. The sex workers&#x27; rights movement started in the 1970s, and one of the founding groups was COYOTE. The goal of the sex workers activist is to fight for workers by having a better work environment/ conditions, reducing negative fed back, and stopping prohibition. 

Carol Leigh is an American woman who is an artist, filmmaker, and sex worker rights activist. Carol Leigh was the first woman to use the term &quot;sex worker&quot;. She wanted to educate others about the understanding of sex workers as well as the rights they should have. In an interview, she stated how she sees her own sex work and the sex work of others as having the possibility to serve a higher, spiritual function in society.

===BDSM===
Sadomasochism (BDSM) has been criticized by anti porn feminists for eroticizing power and violence and for reinforcing misogyny (Rubin, 1984). They argue that women who choose to engage in BDSM are making a choice that is ultimately bad for women. Sex-positive feminists argue that consensual BDSM activities are enjoyed by many women and validate these women&#x27;s sexual inclinations. They argue that feminists should not attack other women&#x27;s sexual desires as being &quot;anti-feminist&quot; or internalizing oppression and that there is no connection between consensual sexually kinky activities and sex crimes.

While some anti-porn feminists suggest connections between consensual BDSM scenes and rape and sexual assault, sex-positive feminists find this to be insulting to women. It is often mentioned that in BDSM, roles are not fixed to gender, but personal preferences. Furthermore, many argue that playing with power (such as rape scenes) through BDSM is a way of challenging and subverting that power, rather than reifying it.

While the negativities about BDSM are discussed a lot, sex-positive feminists are focusing on safety in the BDSM community. Consent is the most important rule when it comes to BDSM.

Cara Dunkley and Lori Brotto discuss the importance of consent in their journal:Consent represents an ongoing interactive and dynamic process that entails several precautionary measures, including negotiations of play, open communication of desires and boundaries, mutually defining terms, the notion of responsibility and transparency, and ensuring protection from harm through competence and skill.Critics discuss that communication with sexual partners is very important.

===Sexual orientation===
McElroy argues that many feminists have been afraid of being associated with homosexuality. Betty Friedan, one of the founders of second-wave feminism, warned against lesbianism and called it &quot;the lavender menace&quot; (a view she later renounced). Sex-positive feminists believe that accepting the validity of all sexual orientations is necessary in order to allow women full sexual freedom. Rather than distancing themselves from homosexuality and bisexuality because they fear it will hurt mainstream acceptance of feminism, sex-positive feminists believe that women&#x27;s liberation cannot be achieved without also promoting acceptance of homosexuality and bisexuality.

===Gender identity===
Some trans exclusionary radical feminists, such as Germaine Greer, have criticized transgender women (male-to-female) as men attempting to appropriate female identity while retaining male privilege, and transgender men (female-to-male) as women who reject solidarity with their gender. One of the main exponents of this point of view is Janice Raymond. In &quot;The Whole Woman&quot;, Greer went so far as to explicitly compare transgender women to rapists for forcing themselves into women&#x27;s spaces.

Many transgender people see gender identity as an innate part of a person. Some feminists also criticize this belief, arguing instead that gender roles are societal constructs, and are not related to any natural factor. Sex-positive feminists support the right of all individuals to determine their own gender and promote gender fluidity as one means for achieving gender equality. Patrick Califia has written extensively about issues surrounding feminism and transgender issues, especially in &quot;Sex Changes: Transgender Politics&quot;.

== Debates ==

Like feminism itself, sex-positive feminism is difficult to define, and few within the movement (particularly the academic arm of the movement) agree on any one ideology or policy agenda.

An example of how feminists may disagree on whether a particular cultural work exemplifies sex-positivity is Betty Dodson&#x27;s critique of Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. Dodson argues that the play promotes a negative view of sexuality, emphasizing sexual violence against women rather than the redemptive value of female sexuality. Many other sex-positive feminists have embraced Ensler&#x27;s work for its encouragement of openness about women&#x27;s bodies and sexuality.

===Statutory rape laws===

There is debate among sex-positive feminists about whether statutory rape laws are a form of sexism. As illustrated by the controversy over &quot;The Little Coochie Snorcher that Could&quot; from the Vagina Monologues, some sex-positive feminists do not consider all consensual activity between young adolescents and older people as inherently harmful. There has been debate among feminists about whether statutory rape laws benefit or harm teenage girls and about whether the gender of participants should influence the law&#x27;s treatment of sexual encounters. Some sex-positive feminists argue that statutory rape laws were made with non-gender neutral intentions and are presently enforced as such, with the assumption that teenage girls are naive, nonsexual, and in need of protection.

Sex-positive feminists with this view believe that &quot;teen girls and boys are equally capable of making informed choices in regard to their sexuality&quot; and that statutory rape laws are actually meant to protect &quot;good girls&quot; from sex. Other feminists are opposed or ambivalent about strengthening statutory rape statutes because these preclude young women from entering consensual sexual relationships, even if competent to consent.

These feminists view statutory rape laws as more controlling than protective – and of course part of the law&#x27;s historic role was protecting the female&#x27;s chastity as valuable property. One writer also noted that, at that time, in some states, the previous sexual experience of a teenager could be used as a defense by one accused of statutory rape. She argued that this showed that the laws were intended to protect chastity rather than consent.

== Critiques ==
Works that critique sex-positive feminism includes those of Germaine Greer and the essays by Dorchen Leidholdt. According to Ann Ferguson, sex-positive feminists&#x27; only restriction on sexual activity should be the requirement of consent, yet she argues that sex-positive feminism has provided inadequate definitions of consent. Sex-positive feminism has also been criticized for focusing on young women, but ignoring middle-aged and elderly women who are unable or unwilling to direct most of their energy into sexuality.

In her 2005 book &quot;Female Chauvinist Pigs&quot;, Ariel Levy does not oppose sex-positive feminism per se, though sees a popularized form of sex-positivity as constituting a kind of &quot;raunch culture&quot; in which women internalize objectifying male views of themselves and other women. Levy believes it is a mistake to see this as empowering and further holds that women should develop their own forms of sexual expression. The response by sex-positive feminists to Levy&#x27;s book has been mixed; Susie Bright viewed the book quite favorably, stating that much of what can be seen as &quot;raunch culture&quot; represents a bastardization of the work of earlier sex-positive feminists such as herself. Rachel Kramer Bussel, however, sees Levy as largely ignoring much of the female-empowered sexual expression of the last 20 years, or misinterpreting it as internalization of male fantasy.

== More to review and/or consider ==

Authors and activists who have written important works about sex-positive feminism, and/or contributed to educating the public about it, include Kathy Acker, Megan Andelloux, Susie Bright, Rachel Kramer Bussel, Diana Cage, Avedon Carol, Patrick Califia, Betty Dodson, Nancy Friday, Jane Gallop, Nina Hartley, Josephine Ho, Amber L. Hollibaugh, Brenda Howard, Laura Kipnis, Wendy McElroy, Inga Muscio, Joan Nestle, Erika Lust, Carol Queen, Candida Royalle, Gayle Rubin, Annie Sprinkle, Tristan Taormino and Ellen Willis. Several of these have written from the perspective of feminist women working in the sex industry.

Information on formal organizations that endorse sex-positive feminism seems lacking but one major outpost of sex-positive feminism is the former cooperative business Good Vibrations founded by Joani Blank in 1977 in order to sell sex toys and publications about sex in an environment welcoming to women. Blank also founded Down There Press which has published various educational publications inspired by sex-positivity. There are a number of other sex-positive feminist businesses who thrive on a combination of sex toy sales and distribution of educational materials. Good For Her, a woman-owned sex-toy shop in Toronto, Ontario, holds an annual Feminist Porn Awards.

Nonprofit groups supporting sex-positive feminism include the currently defunct Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force associated with Carole Vance and Ann Snitow, Feminists for Free Expression, founded by Marcia Pally, and Feminists Against Censorship associated with anti-censorship and civil liberties campaigner Avedon Carol.

Feminist pornography is a small but growing segment of the pornography industry. A Feminist Porn Award was established in 2006. The equivalent in Europe is the PorYes award for feminist porn, established in 2009. The magazine &quot;On Our Backs&quot; was founded in 1986 to promote a more positive attitude towards erotica within the community of lesbian and bisexual women. It flourished until 1994, struggled with financial problems and changing ownership and the final edition was published in 2006.

<text>Carlos Sanchez Ezquerra (; 12 November 1947 – 1 October 2018) was a Spanish comics artist who worked mainly in British comics. He is best known as the co-creator of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early work===
Born in Ibdes, province of Zaragoza, Aragon, Ezquerra started his career drawing westerns and war stories for Spanish publishers. In 1973, he got work in the UK market through agent Barry Coker, drawing for girls&#x27; romance titles such as &quot;Valentine&quot; and &quot;Mirabelle&quot;, as well as westerns for Thorpe &amp; Porter&#x27;s &quot;Pocket Western Library&quot;, and a variety of adventure strips for D. C. Thomson &amp; Co.&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard&quot;. Despite the UK was a convenient market for artists living in Spain as the exchange rate meant the work paid well, Ezquerra decided to move to London to be near the work, settling in Croydon with his wife.

===&quot;Battle&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot;===
In 1974, on the strength of his uncredited work for &quot;The Wizard&quot;, Pat Mills and John Wagner headhunted him, through Coker, to work for the new IPC title &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;. He drew &quot;Rat Pack&quot;: inspired by the film &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, the strip, written by Gerry Finley-Day, featured a gang of criminals recruited to carry out suicide missions. But his commitments elsewhere meant he could not draw it full-time, and other artists were also used. In 1976 &quot;Battle&quot; editor Dave Hunt convinced him to commit himself to the title, offering him the laid-back anti-hero &quot;Major Eazy&quot;, written by Alan Hebden. Ezquerra drew nearly 100 episodes in the next two and a half years, basing the character&#x27;s appearance on the actor James Coburn.
He was asked to visualise a new character, future lawman Judge Dredd, for the science fiction weekly &quot;2000 AD&quot;, prior to its launch in 1977. His elaborate designs displeased the strip&#x27;s writer, John Wagner, but impressed editor Pat Mills, and his cityscapes persuaded Mills to set the strip further into the future than initially intended. But Wagner (temporarily) quit over ownership issues, and Ezquerra followed him when the first published appearance of the character was drawn by another artist, Mike McMahon. He returned to &quot;Battle&quot;, where he once again teamed up with Alan Hebden to create &quot;El Mestizo&quot;, a black gun-for-hire who played both sides against the middle during the American Civil War.
In 1978 he and Wagner created &quot;Strontium Dog&quot;, a science fictional western about a bounty hunter in a future where mutants are an oppressed minority forced into doing such dirty work, for &quot;Starlord&quot;, a short-lived sister title to &quot;2000 AD&quot; with higher production values. &quot;Starlord&quot; was later merged into &quot;2000 AD&quot;, bringing &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; with it. Ezquerra was almost the only artist to draw the character, until 1988, when writer Alan Grant decided to kill him off in a storyline called &quot;The Final Solution&quot;. Ezquerra disagreed with the decision, and refused to draw the story, which was instead illustrated by Simon Harrison and Colin MacNeil. In 2000 Wagner and Ezquerra revived &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; based on a treatment Wagner had written for an abortive TV pilot. Initially, stories were set before the character&#x27;s death in a revised continuity, but 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha&quot; brought Johnny back from the dead.

Other &quot;2000 AD&quot; strips he drew included &quot;Fiends of the Eastern Front&quot; (1980), a vampire story set in World War II, written by Gerry Finley-Day, and adaptations of Harry Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Stainless Steel Rat&quot; novels, with the title character once again resembling James Coburn. In 1982 he returned to &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; to draw &quot;The Apocalypse War&quot;, a seven-month epic which he drew in its entirety. He continued to draw the character semi-regularly, handling the whole of &quot;Necropolis&quot; in 1990, &quot;Origins&quot; in 2006–07, and many others.

His son Hector inked and coloured in his pencil work for &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; between 2008 and 2012.

The character of Stogie from the long-running 2000 AD strip &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot; was given the full name Carlos Sanchez Robo-Stogie in tribute to Ezquerra.

===Other work===
Ezquerra collaborated numerous times with writer Garth Ennis on &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;, &quot;Adventures in the Rifle Brigade&quot;, &quot;War Stories&quot;, &quot;The Boys: The Self-Preservation Society&quot;, a &quot;Hitman&quot; annual, two &quot;Preacher&quot; specials (&quot;The Good Old Boys&quot; and &quot;The Saint of Killers&quot; miniseries) for DC Comics, and &quot;Just a Pilgrim&quot; for Black Bull Entertainment.

Ezquerra occasionally used the pen name &quot;L. John Silver&quot; for work such as &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Riddle of the Astral Assassin!&quot; prog 118, and &quot;ABC Warriors&quot;, progs 134–136.

===Awards===
*National Comics Awards for Best Artist in Comics Today, 2001
*Inkpot Award, 2015

===Death===
In later life Ezquerra moved to Andorra. He died of lung cancer on 1 October 2018, at the age of 70. He never retired, and his uncompleted final work, &quot;Spector,&quot; was published posthumously in June 2019 by &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

In May 2023 the government of Zaragoza voted to name a street after him.

<text>Joey is an American sitcom created by Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan. It is a spin-off of &quot;Friends&quot;, with Matt LeBlanc reprising his role as Joey Tribbiani. It premiered on NBC on September 9, 2004. Midway through the second season, the show was placed on hiatus but returned on March 7, 2006. Only one more episode aired before the show was pulled. NBC canceled the series due to low ratings in May 2006.

==Overview==
The series centers on Joey Tribbiani, who has struck out on his own and moved to Hollywood, hoping to truly make it as an actor. After reuniting with his high-strung sister, Gina, a hairdresser, Joey moves in with his genius twenty-year-old nephew Michael, who is a rocket scientist. He begins a tentative romance with his superintendent, Alexis Garrett, and becomes close friends with fellow aspiring actor Zach Miller.

==Cast and characters==

* Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani, a struggling actor and food lover who becomes famous for his role on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Dr. Drake Ramoray. Joey is a womanizer with many girlfriends throughout the series, in keeping with his character on &quot;Friends.&quot; The series roughly picks up where &quot;Friends&quot; left off, with Joey at the beginning of the show making a move from New York to Los Angeles to proceed with his acting career. He is constantly talking about food or eating sandwiches or pizza.
* Drea de Matteo as Gina Tribbiani, Joey&#x27;s older sister, who is temperamental and promiscuous. Gina is not too bright, yet very street-wise; she is a caring but over-protective and domineering mother. For years, she convinced her genius son, Michael, that he was born when she was 22 instead of sixteen years old, and always says he is the one thing she has done well. She and Joey are friends in addition to being siblings, both having the gift of being extremely appealing to the opposite sex, with numerous lovers. Initially working as a hairdresser, by season two, she works as a secretary for Joey&#x27;s agent, Bobbie, having impressed Bobbie with her brash manner. In season two, she starts dating Michael&#x27;s father, Jimmy, once again. In the season-two episode &quot;Joey and the Holding Hands&quot;, it is implied that Gina may be bisexual.
* Andrea Anders as Alexis &quot;Alex&quot; Garrett, Joey&#x27;s next-door neighbor, landlady, and friend. She is an educated, yet slightly ditzy, blonde lawyer who graduated from Northwestern University and Pepperdine University School of Law. Initially intimidated but also intrigued by Joey&#x27;s tough street-wise older sister, Gina, the two women eventually become friends and she becomes bolder in the way she dresses and acts, thanks to Gina&#x27;s influence. She is puzzled but impressed by Joey&#x27;s intuitive gift of knowing when she is wearing thong panties and spends most of her time hanging out at Joey and Michael&#x27;s apartment. She and Joey bond and become close friends. Her husband is a professional orchestra musician and is away from home most of the time, and she confides her problems with her marriage in Joey. At the end of season one, she and Joey become romantically involved during her separation from her husband. In season two, she becomes romantically interested in Joey and has a crush on him for a long period. Gina tries to help her get over Joey, but once Alex starts dating Joey&#x27;s friend Dean, Joey soon realizes that he is also in love with Alex. Shortly after the series ended, Anders and LeBlanc entered a relationship for nine years.
* Paulo Costanzo as Michael Tribbiani, Joey&#x27;s nephew, who idolizes Joey&#x27;s ability to date many women and who himself is sheltered and nervous around girls. He is self-conscious that he has been so sheltered and that his mother, Gina, breastfed him until he was seven. He is a huge &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan. He is extremely intelligent, an aerospace engineer, attends Caltech, and specialises in applied thermodynamics. He works with his rival, Seth, on engineering projects, and is an obvious direct opposite from his more street-wise mother and uncle. He turns to Joey as a big brother and substitute father figure, even after his biological father, Jimmy, re-enters Gina&#x27;s love life.
* Jennifer Coolidge as Roberta &quot;Bobbie&quot; Morganstern, Joey&#x27;s agent and reportedly the twelfth most powerful woman in Hollywood. She has an enormous crush on Joey&#x27;s nephew, Michael. She often entertains herself by making her office assistant do funny tricks or shocking herself with a stun-gun. She is brash, forward, aggressive, highly entertaining, and slightly ditzy, laughing at everything and at anyone&#x27;s expense, including her client Joey&#x27;s. She was once sued by Phil Collins.
* Miguel A. Núñez Jr. as Zach Miller (season 2), an actor and amateur play director who becomes close friends with Joey. Zach does not appear to have a home; he was seen at one time living in Joey&#x27;s trailer while working on a major blockbuster movie. In one episode, Zach and Joey, both drunk, get married in Tijuana, possibly a parody of Ross and Rachel marrying each other in the season-five finale of &quot;Friends&quot;. Zach&#x27;s final appearance was in &quot;Joey and the Big Move&quot;. Núñez was absent from the last five episodes, including the finale of the series, because he found another job.
* Ben Falcone as Howard Peckerman, Joey&#x27;s friend and neighbor.

Several cast members had previously appeared as different characters in &quot;Friends&quot;: Coolidge appeared as Amanda, an old friend of Monica and Phoebe, in a tenth-season episode. Adam Goldberg, who played Jimmy, appeared in the second season of &quot;Friends&quot; in the recurring role of Eddie, who moves in with Chandler after Joey moves out. Carlos Gómez, who played Sam the director, appeared in one episode of &quot;Friends&quot; as the restaurant worker Julio in &quot;The One with All the Jealousy&quot;. Patrick Kerr, who played the producer of the Daytime Soap Awards, appeared in one episode of &quot;Friends&quot; as a restaurant manager who auditions Monica for a job as a chef. Brent Spiner, who played himself, appeared in one episode of &quot;Friends&quot; as James Campbell, who interviews Rachel for a job.

Additionally, Robert Costanzo reprised his role as Joey&#x27;s father, Joey Tribbiani Sr., who originated in the first season of &quot;Friends&quot;, in &quot;Joey and the Dad&quot;, making Costanzo the only actor besides LeBlanc to play the same character in both series, since Gina and Mary Theresa both appeared in a third-season episode of &quot;Friends&quot; but were not played by Drea de Matteo and Christina Ricci, respectively. Simon Helberg appeared in four episodes as Seth Tobin, a nerdy engineer and friend/rival of Michael who shared many similarities with one of Helberg&#x27;s later characters, Howard Wolowitz, in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. David Schwimmer, who previously portrayed Ross Geller and directed several episodes of &quot;Friends&quot;, returned to direct two episodes of &quot;Joey&quot;.

==Background and development==
After the series finale of &quot;Friends&quot; in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, &quot;Joey&quot;, following Joey&#x27;s move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. &quot;Friends&quot; producers Marta Kauffman and David Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Kevin S. Bright agreed to be executive producer, along with &quot;Joey&quot; creators Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan, the latter of whom left the show after the first season and was replaced by Jon Pollack.

The pilot episode was released in screener for test audiences and members of the entertainment industry to preview the show and drum up business. The screener was subsequently leaked on the internet and thus received a much wider critical review process than initially conceived. There were few differences between the unaired pilot and the version that was broadcast. Ashley Scott played the role of Allison in the unaired pilot but was replaced by Andrea Anders, and the character name changed to Alex. Episode 5 and Episode 13 of season one were directed by David Schwimmer, who played Ross Geller in &quot;Friends.&quot; 

NBC heavily promoted &quot;Joey&quot; and gave it &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot. The series did well in the Nielsen ratings in its first season (2004–2005) and was subsequently renewed for a second season (2005–2006). In the second season, Miguel A. Núñez Jr. was added to the show as a series regular and Jennifer Coolidge had a more prominent role. The pilot was watched by 18.6 million American viewers, but ratings continually decreased throughout the series, averaging 10.2 million viewers in the first season and 7.1 million in the second. The show was pulled from its Thursday-night timeslot in December 2005 and NBC returned it in a new timeslot (Tuesdays at 8pm) on March 7, 2006. Due in part to being in competition with &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Joey&quot; was the lowest-rated prime time program of the week for NBC. The network pulled the series after the first Tuesday broadcast; the remaining episodes have never been broadcast by NBC but were shown on various other networks around the world. The final broadcast episode, on March 7, 2006, was watched by 4.1 million viewers; NBC canceled the series on May 15, 2006, after two seasons. Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio, and other producers for quickly ruining the series:

<doc id="632931" wikidata="Q7747311" url="?curid=632931" title="Lighthouse Keepers (band)">
<text>The Lighthouse Keepers, initially the Light-Housekeepers, were an Australian country and indie pop band formed in 1981 in Canberra. In November 1984 the group issued their debut studio album, &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, and a single, &quot;Ocean Liner&quot;. In 1985 the band toured the United Kingdom supporting Hot label mates, The Triffids. The Lighthouse Keepers combined a &quot;loosely rehearsed, casual ethos&quot; with humour, punk attitudes and pure pop song craft. The ensemble disbanded in 1986, releasing a compilation album, &quot;Imploding&quot;, in November that year. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, their &quot;tasteful, jangly brand of country-tinged folk rock was at odds with prevailing trends on Sydney&#x27;s early 1980s, Detroit-besotted independent scene. The band nevertheless issued a number of albums and singles, and always lived up to audience expectations&quot;.

==Formation==
The Lighthouse Keepers founders&#x27; Greg Appel on acoustic guitar, bass, keyboards and vocals, and Stephen O&#x27;Neil on drums, bass, guitar and saxophone were members of Canberra-based groups The Grant Brothers and Guthugga Pipeline. The pair were joined by Juliet Ward on vocals, bass guitar and keyboards as Tex Truck and the Semis, for a University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) student talent quest. In 1981 augmented by Michael &quot;Blue&quot; Dalton on slide guitar, dobro, bass guitar and harmonica they formed The Lighthouse Keepers. Dalton was a vintage music enthusiast who contributed a country blues style to arrangements as a foil to multi-instrumentalist O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s nifty and melodic bass, drums, guitar and C melody sax playing, further complementing the rich timbre and interpretive abilities of vocalist Ward, with Appel&#x27;s understated but skilfully rendered jangling Morris brand 12 string guitar. All members rotated to bass playing duties both on stage and also in the studio to facilitate various song arrangements.

==Musical influences==
The Lighthouse Keepers&#x27; repertoire was initially steeped in country, blues, folk, pop and jazz which later infused Appel&#x27;s melodic and lyrically engaging songs melded with emotionally charged vocals by Ward. Along with subtle somewhat larrikin humour, stories dealing with suburban teenage angst and interpersonal relationships, were bitter sweet love songs, a couple of instrumental contributions from O&#x27;Neil and Appel, plus a sprinkling of cover versions highlighting their musical influences, for example, &#x27;St. James Infirmary Blues&#x27; and &#x27;Big Noise from Winnetka&#x27;. Other diverse influences included Australian country musician, Chad Morgan, American C&amp;W songs such as &#x27;A Dear John Letter&#x27; and Sun Records era rockabilly artists including early Narvel Felts, as well as the newly emerging and more contemporary British American and Australian independent bands of the time.

==Early recordings==
The Lighthouse Keepers&#x27; early cassette recordings include a live performance (replete with Ward&#x27;s dog &quot;Chaos&quot; contributing back up vocals) of a Tim Spencer composition &quot;Cigareetes and Whusky&quot;, originally recorded by The Sons of the Pioneers, the Willie Dixon Big Three Trio and Red Ingle. A demo version of the country standard &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; (popularised by Patsy Cline), was recorded in late 1982 on a Sony 4-track and mixed to cassette, with vocals by Ward accompanied by Appel on acoustic guitar who later overdubbed bass and slide guitars.

==&quot;Gargoyle&quot;==

In 1983 The Lighthouse Keepers issued their first single, &quot;Gargoyle&quot;, as a three-track 7 inch vinyl 45rpm on their own independent label, Guthugga Pipeline Records. Production costs were financed independently by the band and early pressings sported individually hand drawn disc labels and cover art by band members. 

The A-side, &quot;Gargoyle&quot;, featured vocals by Ward, and the two B-side tracks: &quot;Demolition Team&quot;, and &quot;Quick Sticks&quot;, were both sung by Appel. All three original compositions were written by Appel who played 12 string acoustic guitar utilising a stomp box effects unit compressor. O&#x27;Neil played percussion on a borrowed drum kit. Initial overdubs including bass guitar played by Appel and blues style harmonica and dobro style slide guitar by Dalton were later finished by doubletracking of Ward&#x27;s vocals.

Recordings were completed at Dream Studios Mk3 on a Teac 8-track 1/2 inch analog reel to reel tape recorder running at 7 1/2 ips and later mixed to a Technics 15 ips -inch 2-track referenced with Auratone 5c sound cubes. 

In keeping with the prevailing autodidactic &#x27;zeitgeist&#x27;, the audio engineers encouraged the band to purchase their own blank tapes and follow the production processes from mastering by Don Bartley at EMI&#x27;s Sydney Studios to &quot;test pressing&quot; at EMI&#x27;s Homebush record plant where vinyl discs were manufactured through EMI&#x27;s custom pressing service. &quot;&quot; is etched near the matrix numbers of the run-out grooves.

==&quot;The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers&quot; (1983)==
In mid-1983, the Lighthouse Keepers added Steven Williams on drums and as their manager – Williams was also a member of post punk band The Particles with O&#x27;Neil. In November The Lighthouse Keepers released a second recording on their own Guthugga Pipeline label. The self-produced and -distributed 12-inch 45 rpm six-track &quot;Lo-fi&quot; extended play was titled &quot;The Exploding Lighthouse Keepers&quot;. The EP showcased another five of Appel&#x27;s songs and musical arrangements plus a cover version of the Bo Carter country blues song &quot;Whisky and Gin&quot;.

Opening with &quot;Springtime&quot;, the EP highlighted the country blues style harmonica of Dalton which was in part characteristic of the Lighthouse Keepers&#x27; sound. The disc heralded the introduction of brass instruments into the group&#x27;s instrumental range which continued in subsequent recordings. Trumpet player Alex Hamilton, who also played the solo on The Particles track &quot;I Luv Trumpet&quot;, contributed overdubbed brass lines on &quot;Bad Mood&quot; and the duet intro for country ballad &quot;Again&quot;. Musical arrangements were embellished with keyboard and tambourine played by Ward with additional percussion by O&#x27;Neil. The integration of the driving pop sensibility of drummer Williams, allowed O&#x27;Neil to add second guitar parts to &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;Narvel Felts&quot;. Album cover artwork was by Appel with the record sleeve insert artwork attributed to Fabian.

With the exception of &quot;Whiskey and Gin&quot; (which was recorded direct to a Technics 15 ips -inch 2-track in the bathroom of a Redfern terrace) , all other tracks were recorded as live instrumental backing tracks (guide vocals retained and later doubled to form a composite vocal track) with drums sub mixed to stereo allowing space for overdubs. Recording was again done at Peter Hornak&#x27;s, Dream Studio Mk3, located in an old warehouse in the historic Haymarket area of Sydney.

==&quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (1984)==
The Lighthouse Keepers signed to Hot Records where their diverse label mates included Wet Taxis, The Triffids and Laughing Clowns. In August 1984 the label re-issued &quot;Gargoyle&quot; and followed in November with the band&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; which resulted in their most successful single &quot;Ocean Liner&quot;. The album was recorded during August at Paradise Studios in Woolloomooloo, Sydney by David Price, assisted by Tom Colley, the house engineers . The recording facility featured Westlake Audio monitors (cross referenced by Yamaha NS-10 near field monitors), twin MCI 24-track tape recorders, Harrison automated mixing console and &#x27;state of the art&#x27; acoustic design and microphones. The album was recorded and mixed at 30ips during ten &quot;discount rate&quot; consecutive midnight to dawn sessions. It was produced by The Lighthouse Keepers and John Basett and mixed by Price, LHK and Basett. Additional musicians provided mandolin, banjo, baritone sax, trombone and trumpet. The band rose to the challenges of working at a professional level, taking the opportunity to develop their own distinctive sound and musical direction. Mastering, test pressing and record production from stampers was completed at the CBS studios (see also Columbia records). The album cover painting artwork was by O&#x27;Neil.

==Career highlights==
The Lighthouse Keepers are described in various rock music publications, including &quot;Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop&quot;(1999) &quot;The Who&#x27;s Who of Australian Rock&quot; (2002), &quot;Inner City Sound&quot; (2005), and &quot;Blunt: A Biased History of Australian Rock&quot; (2001). They were also favourably reviewed by Stuart Coupe in the &quot;Sun Herald&quot;. as well as sections of the local rock press who were generally supportive of indie bands, including &quot;On the Street&quot;, &quot;RAM&quot;, &quot;Juke&quot; and other publications. The Lighthouse Keepers received airplay through the alternative radio stations 2SER, 2JJJ and similar community radio networks interstate. They garnered glowing reviews in the British music journals, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;. They supported international artists touring Australia such as Jonathan Richman and John Cooper Clarke (1983) and The Violent Femmes, as well as the Brisbane band The Go-Betweens (1984). They built up a loyal following whilst performing regularly along the Australian east coast with occasional treks westwards across the Nullarbor Plain to Perth. The Lighthouse Keepers undertook a low key tour of Europe in 1985, which included an outdoor festival in Rotterdam headlined by The Triffids and The Woodentops, as well as gigs in Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Austria, returning to England to support The Triffids at Leeds University, the Clarendon Hammersmith and other shows in and around London.

==&quot;Imploding&quot; (1986)==
Early in 1986 The Lighthouse Keepers returned to Australia and disbanded after a career including over 350 performances. On 28 March they held a farewell show at the Graphics Arts Club, Chippendale. In November, Waterfront Records released their compilation album, &#x27;Imploding&#x27;. The runout groove on side-B read &quot;&quot;.

==Reunions==
Since disbanding, The Lighthouse Keepers have reunited sporadically to play private parties, launch their own 2× CD compilation, &quot;Lipsnipegroin&quot;, at the Annandale Hotel in Sydney (1992) and help launch the 2× CD various artists compilation, &#x27;Tales from the Australian Underground&#x27; at the Metro in Sydney (2003). They have also played tribute shows, benefits, (2009) and opened both nights of the final leg of a Laughing Clowns reformation tour at the Basement in Sydney (2009).

In August 2011, a further compilation of The Lighthouse Keepers&#x27; material &quot;ode to nothing&quot; was issued as a 15-track remastered &quot;best of&quot; CD. They were joined by Perth-based drummer Hugh Veldon for a well attended and reviewed live show at the Sandringham Hotel Sydney September (2011) followed by a string of suburban gigs during January and February 2012 in Melbourne, Canberra with the final performance in Sydney at Marrickville. Some of these shows featured ex- Widdershins left handed drummer Peter Timmerman as well as original drummer Steven Williams returning to reprise his role on some songs with extra excitement generated when he and Timmerman played drums simultaneously. The shows were unique in featuring a &quot;guest speaker&quot; each night.

Adapting to the new media LHK, old fans, and an emerging modern audience interacted via social network services which saw releases of additional self-produced DIY video clips from the band, and had the unexpected reciprocal benefit of generating a number of videos, captured by audience members of live performances from the reunion tour, using a variety of devices ranging from hand held mobile phones and cameras to digital video recorders and then uploaded to YouTube.

==Postscript==
Stephen O&#x27;Neil became a librarian and maintained an international recording and touring career with indie pop group, The Cannanes.

Appel and Ward formed the short-lived Rainlovers, which in 1987 evolved into Widdershins before disbanding in 1989. Appel and younger brother Steve also played live and recorded together in various loose-knit bands sometimes with their youngest brother David (vocals, trumpet, percussion). A fourth Appel brother, Rob, founded the Internet music retail website Chaos.com.

Ward is a scientific researcher who has studied the Dingo and still performs live casually. She participated in a 2007 podcast, and does occasional interviews. As &quot;Jet&quot; Ward she recorded a cover version of the song &quot;Rachael Cooper&quot; by Baterz ( a member of the cult band The Bedridden) on the 3× CD album, &quot;Great Big Sqiddy Fun- A Baterz Tribute&quot;.

Appel has his own Spontaneous Films production company and has also worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) producing and/or directing radio and TV projects, including work with producer Paul Clarke on the ABC six-part music documentary series, &#x27;Long Way To The Top&#x27; (August–September 2001).

Amongst other post The Lighthouse Keepers projects is Van Park – The Musical written by Appel and featuring music by Steve&#x27;s King Curly and a cast including John Paul Young and Steve Kilbey, which premiered at the Seymour Centre during the 2010 Sydney Fringe Festival; and in March 2013 was revived for the Oakleigh &#x27;Carnival of Suburbia&#x27; in Melbourne.

<text>Imants Kalniņš (born 26 May 1941) is a Latvian composer, musician and politician. Having studied classical and choral music, he has written seven symphonies, several operas (including the first rock opera in the USSR, ), oratorios, cantatas, choir songs, a lot of movie and theater music. However, he is generally best known for his rock songs. In 2021, Kalniņš received the Grand Music Award for lifetime achievement.

Furthermore, he served as a member of the 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th sitting of the Saeima, the parliament of Latvia, from 1993 to 1995 and again from 1998 through 2010, representing the For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK party.

== Life and career ==
Kalniņš was born 26 May 1941 in Riga, Latvian SSR. During the 1960s, Kalniņš led the Liepāja rock band 2xBBM, which was extremely loved because of its heartfelt songs and hippy-like lifestyle. Kalniņš became the symbol of the spirituality, rebellion and worldview of the generation, and it was emphasized by the fact the band was forced to stop playing because of the pressure from official institutions. However, this did not stop the music of Kalniņš from being played by the extremely popular band , which almost exclusively plays songs written by Kalniņš.

During the 1970s, Kalniņš returned to writing symphonic music. In 1984, he wrote the rock oratorio &quot;Kā jūra, kā zeme, kā debess&quot; (&quot;Like the sea, like the earth, like the sky&quot;) together with and Juris Sējāns. The oratorio was the first thing played by the band Pērkons for the general public. With it Kalniņš returned to rock and roll once more. He wrote many new songs for Pērkons, and these same songs led him to start his own band, in 1985, however, it never gained the recognition and adoration as Menuets and Pērkons.

During the Singing Revolution, Kalniņš took an active part in the Popular Front of Latvia, which played the most important role in ending Latvia&#x27;s occupation by the USSR.

The festival most associated with Kalniņš is the Imantdienas (&#x27;The Days of Imants&#x27;), extremely popular during the Soviet times and therefore banned. The tradition was reintroduced in 1995, and since then has happened every year (with the exception of 1997, when the composer was away on a trip, and 2009 after the 2008 Latvian financial crisis). It has remained at least as popular as before.

Lately, Imants Kalniņš has been working together with the well-known Latvian musician , and their collaboration has resulted in some albums containing primarily music by Kalniņš, such as &quot;Par lietām, kas tā ar&#x27; nekad nepāriet&quot; (&quot;About things that never truly go away&quot;) (1997), &quot;Es redzēju sapnī&quot; (&quot;I Saw in a dream&quot;) (1998) and &quot;I Love You&quot; (1999; despite the English title, the lyrics are mostly in Latvian in this album).

In 2000, music for the 1973 movie &quot; was re-recorded by the Liepāja Symphony Orchestra as well as many recognized singers.

In 1973, Kalniņš composed the song &quot;, which became the official anthem of Liepāja in 1999.

In April 2015, after his translation of Quran from Arabic to Latvian, Kalniņš was reported to have converted Islam by some outlets, but Kalniņš himself has later refuted these claims.

==Private life==
Kalniņš has been married five times. In total, he has 7 children. The third marriage, the longest of the former wedlocks, was with the actress Helga Dancberga who died in 2019. They had three children, Dana Kalniņa-Zaķe who became the lead for the Latvian Association of Professional Health Care Chaplains, actress Rēzija Kalniņa and pastor Krists Kalniņš. Currently, he is married to Agra (since 1999).

<text>The 2003–04 season was the 124th season of association football in England. Arsenal completed the season without losing a league match, becoming Premier League champions in the process. Leeds United avoided going into administration, but were unable to avoid relegation and lost their place in the Premier League - along with Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Norwich City won promotion to the Premier League as Champions after nine years in Division 1. They were joined by runners-up West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace, who beat West Ham United in the play-off final. Wimbledon completed their relocation to Milton Keynes and moved into the former England National Hockey Stadium, which would be used as a temporary home until a new stadium was built at Denbigh North. At the end of the season, following the Dons&#x27; relegation, club directors changed its name to Milton Keynes Dons. Bradford City and Walsall joined them in relegation to Football League One.

Plymouth Argyle were Division Two champions and ensured that they would be playing in the second tier of English football for the first time in 12 years. Queens Park Rangers joined them together with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion who won the play-off. At the bottom, Rushden &amp; Diamonds were relegated to Division Three along with Grimsby Town, who suffered a second consecutive relegation after losing the last game of the season. Notts County and Wycombe Wanderers were also relegated. In the same division, Oldham Athletic were in financial difficulties but they avoided going into administration after a takeover bid was confirmed.

Doncaster Rovers became Division Three champions to earn their second successive promotion, having been Conference play-off winners the previous season. They had not played above the league&#x27;s lowest tier for nearly 20 years; they were joined by Hull City, Torquay United and play-off winners Huddersfield Town.

Carlisle United were relegated to the Conference from Division Three. They had spent all but two of the previous 17 seasons in the league&#x27;s fourth tier. York City followed them out of the Football League after a poor second half of the season. Chester City and Shrewsbury Town were promoted to the Football League from the Football Conference.

Telford United, who had been members of the Conference for every season since its formation in 1979, went out of business at the end of a season in which they had reached the Fourth Round of the FA Cup. The club was quickly reformed as A.F.C. Telford United and joined the Northern Premier League.

Meanwhile, Wolverhampton Wanderers lost the first three games of their first top flight campaign for 20 years; Bolton Wanderers and Middlesbrough completed the bottom three. The race to get into the Premier League was headed by West Bromwich Albion, who were a point ahead of their nearest rivals Reading and Sheffield United at the top of Division One.

*30 September 2003: Arsenal led the Premier League, but their nearest challengers Chelsea and Manchester United were just a point behind. Surprise title contenders Birmingham City and Southampton completed the top five, but there was widespread doubt as to whether they could continue their good form and make a serious challenge to record their first-ever top division title. Wolverhampton Wanderers were still bottom and looking for their first win of the season; Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur completed the bottom three.

Birmingham remained fourth, while Fulham moved into the top five at the expense of Southampton.

*30 November 2003: Chelsea lead the Premier League, one point ahead of Arsenal and four points ahead of Manchester United. Debt-ridden Leeds propped up the top flight, joined in the relegation zone by Wolves and Everton. West Brom and Norwich were top of Division One, followed by Sheffield United, Ipswich, Wigan and Reading.
*19 December 2003: Rio Ferdinand received an eight-month ban from football and a £50,000 fine as penalty for missing a drugs test on 22 September. The ban commenced on 19 January, though Ferdinand was intent on appealing against it.
*31 December 2003: Manchester United were leaders of the Premier League; their nearest contenders Arsenal (unbeaten) and Chelsea were four points behind. Charlton Athletic and Fulham completed the top five, with Liverpool and Newcastle close behind. Wolves and Leeds were bottom of the division; Everton were comfortably clear of the bottom three.

*28 January 2004: Arsenal signed Sevilla striker José Antonio Reyes for £10.5 million.
*30 January 2004: Chelsea signed Charlton midfielder Scott Parker for £10 million.
*31 January 2004: Manchester United topped the Premier League, with unbeaten Arsenal a point behind and a game in hand. Chelsea&#x27;s bid for the title took a setback; they were in third place with a seven-point gap between them and the top spot followed by Charlton and Liverpool. Leeds, Wolves and Leicester occupied the bottom three places. Norwich and West Brom were still leading the way at the top of Division One. Sheffield United, Sunderland, Ipswich and Wigan occupied the play-off zone.
*2 February 2004: Tottenham paid £7 million for West Ham striker Jermain Defoe.
*29 February 2004: Middlesbrough won their first ever trophy as a professional club by beating Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup final. In the Premier League, Arsenal were still unbeaten and were top of the league with a nine-point advantage over Chelsea and Manchester United. Newcastle and Charlton completed the top five, followed closely by Liverpool and Aston Villa. Leeds and Leicester remained in the bottom three, but Wolves had climbed out of the drop zone at the expense of Portsmouth. Norwich and West Brom remained at the top of Division One, and West Ham edged Sheffield United out of an otherwise unchanged play-off zone.
*2 March 2004: Gordon Strachan, who was due to depart as Southampton manager at the end of the season, resigned from the club with immediate effect.
*4 March 2004: Paul Sturrock departed from Division Two leaders Plymouth Argyle to become Southampton&#x27;s new manager.
*5 March 2004: Three Leicester City players – Paul Dickov, Keith Gillespie and Frank Sinclair – were charged with sexual assault while on a training camp in La Manga, Spain.
*7 March 2004: A brace from Malky Mackay followed up by a goal from Darren Huckerby secured East Anglian derby victory for Norwich over Ipswich.
*31 March 2004: Arsenal, the first team to complete 30 matches unbeaten at the start of a league season, led Chelsea by seven points with Manchester United a further five points behind. They were also in contention for both the Champions League and the FA Cup. Liverpool and Newcastle completed the top five as Charlton&#x27;s bid for a European place was fading fast, the competition now coming from Birmingham and Aston Villa. At the other end of the table, time was running out for Wolves and Leeds; Leicester were still giving the rest of the bottom ten a good run for their money. Norwich and West Brom were equal on points at the top of Division One, and Millwall had edged Wigan out of the top six.
*10 April 2004: Arsenal&#x27;s double hopes ended when they lost 1–0 to Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park.
*25 April 2004: Arsenal clinched the Premier League title – and were still unbeaten – after a 2–2 draw with Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Norwich and West Brom had their promotion from Division One confirmed. The play-off places were still being contested between seven clubs: Sunderland, Ipswich, West Ham, Wigan, Sheffield United, Reading and Crystal Palace, who had climbed from 19th to 7th since the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager four months previously.
*30 April 2004: Arsenal finished April as Premier League champions while Chelsea and Manchester United fought closely for second place. Liverpool and Aston Villa completed the top five, though the seven teams below them still stood a chance of a top-five finish and European qualification. Wolves and Leicester needed a miracle to avoid relegation, and Leeds were still giving most of the rest of the bottom ten a run for their money.
*1 May 2004: Leicester&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League was confirmed just one season after promotion; Wolves needed to win both of their remaining games by a significant margin and hope that Manchester City would suffer heavy defeats in both of theirs to survive, despite beating Everton. Leeds still needed at least a draw against Bolton to have any chance of avoiding relegation. At the top of the Premiership, Chelsea looked set for second place while Manchester United seemed certain to settle for third place, with Liverpool and Newcastle completing the top five.
*2 May 2004: Leeds lost 4–1 to Bolton (despite taking the lead) at the Reebok Stadium, effectively sealing their relegation to the soon-to-be rebranded Football League Championship (exactly three years after contesting a Champions League semi-final), joining Leicester and Wolves.
*15 May 2004: Arsenal completed the Premier League season unbeaten with a 2–1 win over Leicester, only the third time since the formation of the Football League in 1888 that a team has gone an entire season unbeaten in the league. Joining them in next season&#x27;s Champions League were Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool (occupying second, third and fourth place respectively), while fifth-placed Newcastle qualified for the UEFA Cup with League Cup winners Middlesbrough.
*16 May 2004: Arsenal signed Dutch winger Robin van Persie from Feyenoord for £2.75 million.
*17 May 2004: Goalkeeper Paul Robinson left relegated Leeds in a £1.5 million move to Spurs.

*22 May 2004: Manchester United beat Millwall 3–0 to clinch the FA Cup for the 11th time in their history. The losers had played their first-ever major cup final; however, Manchester United&#x27;s participation in the Champions League meant that Millwall would be competing in the UEFA Cup next season, the first time they will have ever played in a European competition.
*24 May 2004: Gérard Houllier was sacked after six years as manager of Liverpool.
*27 May 2004: Telford United, who reached the FA Cup fourth round in this season, were liquidated and removed from the Conference as a result. Leeds sold striker Alan Smith to rivals Manchester United for £7 million.
*29 May 2004: Crystal Palace, who were 19th in Division One when Iain Dowie became manager on 22 December, won promotion to the Premier League with a 1–0 win over West Ham in the play-off final. Neil Shipperley scored the only goal of the game. Ironically, Dowie was a former player of both of these clubs.
*1 June 2004: Chelsea signed Rennes and Czech Republic goalkeeper Petr Čech for £7 million.
*2 June 2004: José Mourinho took over as manager of Chelsea, replacing the sacked Claudio Ranieri.

===FA Premier League===

Despite the Premiership title picture being a three-horse race for much of the campaign, Arsenal remained unbeaten all season long and clinched the title with 90 points and an 11-point gap over runners-up Chelsea, who had been most people&#x27;s favourites for the title after a £100 million summer spending spree. After losing defender Rio Ferdinand to an eight-month ban for missing a drugs test in September, defending champions Manchester United turned in some lacklustre performances during the second half of the season, which put paid to their hopes of retaining their crown and restricting them to a third-place finish, some 15 points behind Arsenal. Solace came in the form of a record 11th FA Cup triumph, defeating Millwall 3–0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium.

Liverpool were the final team to qualify for the Champions League, finishing in fourth place, but leaving them 30 points behind Arsenal and slightly closer to the relegation zone than the title winners, and manager Gérard Houllier was sacked shortly after the season&#x27;s end.

League Cup winners Middlesbrough qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time in their history, joined by fifth-placed Newcastle United, who edged out Aston Villa – who had recovered from as low as 18th place in November – on goal difference. Seventh-placed Charlton Athletic and eighth-placed Bolton Wanderers both achieved their highest league finishes since the 1950s, while ninth-placed Fulham (many people&#x27;s pre-season relegation favourites) defied the odds under 33-year-old manager Chris Coleman and achieved the highest league finish of their history. Birmingham City, in their second season since promotion, also enjoyed a solid year, finishing tenth.

Portsmouth, also considered favourites for relegation pre-season, finished a respectable 13th in their first top-flight season for 16 years, despite finishing behind bitter rivals Southampton, who recovered from the sudden resignation of Gordon Strachan in March to finish 12th.

Newly promoted Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers both went down after just one season (Wolves not gaining one away win all season), while Leeds United&#x27;s Premiership status was crushed under a multi-million pound debt which had been mounting relentlessly for the best part of three years, as their relegation ultimately became a matter of when rather than if, ending their top-flight membership after 14 successive seasons among the elite.

Leading goalscorer: Thierry Henry (Arsenal) – 30

===Football League First Division===

The top three led the division for most of the season, but Sunderland could not shake off their poor start and lost out to Norwich, who returned to the Premiership after nearly a decade, and West Brom, who bounced back to the Premiership after relegation the previous season. Crystal Palace achieved one of the most unlikely promotions of recent times, spending the entire first half of the season in the relegation zone under manager Steve Kember before surging into the play-off places under new manager Iain Dowie.

West Ham continued to sell most of their top players following relegation the previous season, but overcame the sudden sacking of Glenn Roeder only three games into the season as his replacement Alan Pardew guided them to 4th place, with the loss to Crystal Palace in the playoff final the only disappointment. Wigan&#x27;s first season in the First Division saw them finish two points off the play-off places in seventh, failing to win any of their last 4 games, although they did finish above last season&#x27;s playoff finalists Sheffield United on goal difference.

Wimbledon&#x27;s move to Milton Keynes took its toll on the club, and they finished bottom of the table in an abysmal final season for the club before it was renamed as MK Dons. Bradford fared little better, despite the presence of former England captain Bryan Robson in the manager&#x27;s chair. Walsall made a respectable start to the season before slumping somewhat later on, and finally crashing into the relegation zone; just a single point from any of their last three games would have ensured survival.

Millwall qualified for the UEFA Cup for finishing as runners-up in the FA Cup, as winners Manchester United already qualified for the Champions League.

Leading goalscorer: Andrew Johnson (Crystal Palace) – 27

===Football League Second Division===

Plymouth Argyle finished top of the division, though they lost manager Paul Sturrock to Southampton. Queens Park Rangers grabbed the second spot from under the noses of Bristol City, who proceeded to lose the play-off final to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, another side who bounced back from relegation the previous season.

Tony Adams, previously suggested by many as a possible future manager of Arsenal and England, failed to keep Wycombe Wanderers up, ending their ten-year spell in the division. Notts County nearly went bankrupt during the course of the season and the effect on the club was evident, as they slipped into Division Three (or League Two, as it would be called the next season). Rushden &amp; Diamonds&#x27; years of success came to a grinding halt as they suffered their first-ever relegation and crashed out of the division after being promoted the previous year. Grimsby Town filled the final relegation spot, resulting in their second consecutive relegation; they had looked safe in the final weeks, but ultimately went down after a poor sequence of results combined with revivals by Chesterfield and Stockport County.

Leading goalscorer: Leon Knight (Brighton &amp; Hove Albion) and Stephen McPhee (Port Vale) – 25

===Football League Third Division===

Doncaster Rovers earned a second successive promotion, showing that the club was firmly back on track after the years of struggle and scandal that the club had endured in the late 1990s. Hull City were another team who had suffered much strife in the previous decade, but this time their extensive investment in players finally paid off, and they were promoted as runners-up. Torquay United earned the third automatic promotion spot from Huddersfield on the last day of the season. Huddersfield Town would make up for this by beating Mansfield in the play-off final, earning an immediate return after the previous year&#x27;s relegation.

Despite winning 4 out of their last 5 games, Yeovil missed out on the playoffs on goal difference in their first ever season in the Football League, while Swansea, nearly relegated the previous season, finished 10th, but were still closer to the drop zone than the playoffs.

York City were in play-off contention for a large part of the campaign, but a disastrous end to the season saw them lose 16 of their last 20 games, costing them their 80-year-old League status. Conversely, Carlisle United started the season horrendously, but a late run saw them finish 23rd. A few years ago this would have seen them complete an amazing escape from relegation, but with the introduction of two relegation places from the League it was no longer sufficient, and they dropped into the Conference, becoming the first former top-flight team to suffer this indignity.

Leading goalscorer: Steve MacLean (Scunthorpe United) – 23

**– Jimmy Davis, 21, Manchester United and England under-21 striker, died in a car crash on the M40 just hours before the club to whom he had been loaned – Watford – were due to play.

He was promoted from the role of assistant manager to the manager&#x27;s seat at three clubs – Luton Town, Wimbledon and Blackburn Rovers. He also had spells in charge of Fulham, West Bromwich Albion and finally Queens Park Rangers. His last post was as first-team coach at Millwall, and helped them win the Division Two title in 2001.

<text>General Sir William Francis Patrick Napier KCB (7 December 178512 February 1860) was a British soldier in the British Army and a military historian.

==Early life==
Napier was born at Celbridge, County Kildare, the third son of Colonel George Napier (1751–1804) and his wife, Lady Sarah Lennox (1745–1826).

==Military service==
He became an ensign in the Royal Irish Artillery in 1800, but at once exchanged into the 62nd, and was put on half-pay in 1802. He was afterwards made a cornet in the Royal Horse Guards by the influence of his uncle the Duke of Richmond, and for the first time did actual military duty in this regiment, but he soon accepted Sir John Moore&#x27;s suggestion that he should exchange into the 52nd, which was about to be trained at Shorncliffe Army Camp. Through Sir John Moore he soon obtained a company in the 43rd, joined that regiment at Shorncliffe and became a favourite with Moore.

He served in Denmark, and was present at the engagement of Koege (Køge) and, his regiment being shortly afterwards sent to Spain, took part in the retreat to Corunna, the hardships of which permanently impaired his health. In 1809 he became &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to his cousin the Duke of Richmond, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, but joined the 43rd when that regiment was ordered again to Spain. With the light brigade (the 43rd, 52nd, and 95th), under the command of General Craufurd, he was on the march to Talavera which he described in his &quot;History&quot;, and had a violent attack of pleurisy on the way.

He, however, refused to leave Spain, was wounded on the Coa, and shot near the spine at Cazal Nova. After taking part in the pursuit of Masséna after he left the lines of Torres Vedras, he and his brother George were recommended for a brevet majority. He became Brigade Major, was present at Fuentes d&#x27;Onoro, but an attack of fever obliged him to return to England.

In England he married his cousin Caroline Amelia Fox, daughter of General Henry Fox and niece of the statesman Charles James Fox. They had a number of children, one of whom, Pamela Adelaide Napier, married Philip William Skynner Miles and had a son, Philip Napier Miles. Another daughter, Louisa Augusta Napier, married General Sir Patrick Leonard MacDougall.

Three weeks after his marriage he again went to Spain, and was present at the storming of Badajoz, where his friend Colonel McLeod was killed. In the absence of the new Lieutenant-Colonel he took command of the 43rd regiment (he was now a substantive Major) and commanded it at Salamanca. After a short stay at home he again joined his regiment at the Pyrenees, and secured the most strongly fortified part of Soult&#x27;s position at the Nivelle. He served with his regiment at the battles of the Nive, where he received two wounds, Orthes, and Toulouse. For his services he was made brevet Lieutenant-Colonel, and one of the first Companions of the Bath. Like his brother Charles he then entered the military college at Farnham. He commanded his regiment in the invasion of France after Waterloo, and remained in France with the army of occupation until 1819, when he retired on half-pay. As could not live on a Major&#x27;s half-pay with a wife and family, he decided to become an artist, taking a house in Sloane Street, where he studied with George Jones, the academician.

==Historian==
While in France he improved his general education, and his post-army career was in literature, not art. He wrote a review of Jomini&#x27;s works (&quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;) in 1821, and in 1823 Henry Bickersteth suggested that he write a history of the Peninsular War.

As an author he wished to defend the memory of Sir John Moore, and to prevent his old chief being overshadowed by that of Wellington. The Duke of Wellington himself gave him much assistance, and handed over the whole of Joseph Bonaparte&#x27;s correspondence captured at the battle of Vittoria; this was all in cipher, but Mrs Napier discovered the key. Marshal Soult took an active interest in the work arranging for a French translation of &quot;Mathieu Dumas&quot;.

The first volume of his &quot;History of the War in the Peninsular&quot; appeared in 1828. The publisher John Murray was disappointed by the sales of the first volume so Napier published the remaining five volumes himself. These proved successful, and when in 1840 the last volume of the &quot;History&quot; was published, his reputation not only in England but in France and Germany was well established.

His life during these years had been chiefly absorbed in his &quot;History&quot;, but he sympathized with the movement for political reform in England. &#x27;The Radicals&#x27; of Bath, (forerunners of Chartism), among many other cities and towns pressed him to enter parliament. Napier&#x27;s friends actually invited to become the military chief of a national guard to obtain reforms by force of arms, which he refused on the ground that he was in bad health and had a family of eight children. In 1830 he had been promoted Colonel, and by 1841 he attained the rank of Major-General and was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey. On Guernsey he was engaged in controlling relations between soldiers and the inhabitants. He was working on proposals for a complete scheme of reform in the government of the island, upsetting many people in the process, when his tenure came to an end.
While he was at Guernsey his brother Charles had conquered Sindh, and the attacks made on the policy of that conquest led to William Napier again to write. In 1845 he published his &quot;The Conquest of Scinde&quot;, and in 1851 the corresponding &quot;History of the Administration of Scinde&quot;. In 1847 he resigned his governorship, and in 1848 was made a Knight Commander of the Bath and settled at Scinde House, Clapham Park. In 1848 he was given the colonelcy of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot which he held until 1853, when he transferred to succeed his brother Charles as colonel of the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment of Foot. In 1851 he was promoted Lieutenant-General.

His time was fully occupied in defending his brother, in revising the numerous editions of his &quot;History&quot; and in writing letters to &quot;The Times&quot; on military and literary subjects. He never fully recovered from the effects of the wound received at Cazal Nova, and often lay on his back for months to assuage.

William&#x27;s domestic life was overshadowed by an incurable illness of his only son. When his brother Charles died in 1853 he wrote a life for his brother, which appeared in 1857. At the end of 1853 his younger brother, Captain Henry Napier RN., died and, in 1855, his brother Sir George. He lived until the year 1860, when, suffering ill health, he died at Clapham, and was buried at West Norwood. Four months earlier he had been promoted to the full rank of general.

There is a memorial to him in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Works==
The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition considered his military history, at the time, to be &quot;incomparably superior to any other English writer&quot;, comparing him to three other soldier-writers: Thucydides, Julius Caesar and Enrico Caterino Davila. Among his works are:
* &quot;History of the War in the Peninsula and the South of France from the Year 1807 to the Year 1814&quot; (6 vols.) (1828–40)
* &quot;The Conquest of Scinde&quot; (1845)
* &quot;History of General Sir Charles Napier&#x27;s Administration of Scinde, and Campaign in the Cutchee Hills&quot; (1851)
* &quot;The life and opinions of General Sir Charles James Napier&quot;, (4 vols.) (1857)

<doc id="632952" wikidata="Q3294411" url="?curid=632952" title="Leucius Charinus">
<text>Leucius, called Leucius Charinus by Photios I of Constantinople in the ninth century, is named by Evodius, bishop of Uzala, as the author of a cycle of what M. R. James termed &quot;Apostolic romances&quot;. These works seem to have had wide currency long before a selection from them was read aloud at the Second Council of Nicaea (787) and then rejected. Leucius is not among the early heretical teachers mentioned by name in Irenaeus&#x27; &quot;Adversus haereses&quot; (&quot;ca.&quot; 180). Most of the works seem to be products of the mid-third century.

The fullest account of Leucius is that given by Photius (Codex 114). He describes a book, called &quot;The Circuits of the Apostles&quot;, which contained the Acts of Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas, and Paul, that was purported to have been written by &quot;Leucius Charinus&quot;. Photius considers it to be full of folly, self-contradiction, falsehood, and impiety (Wace); Photius is the only source to give his second name, &quot;Charinus&quot;. Epiphanius (&quot;Haer&quot;. 51.427) made Leucius a disciple of John who joined his master in opposing the Ebionites, a characterization that appears unlikely, since other patristic writers agree that the cycle attributed to him was docetic, which denies the humanity of Jesus as Christ. Augustine knew the cycle, which he attributed to &quot;Leutius&quot;, which his adversary Faustus of Mileve thought had been wrongly excluded from the New Testament canon by the Catholics. Gregory of Tours found a copy of the &quot;Acts of Andrew&quot; from the cycle and made an epitome of it, omitting the &quot;tiresome&quot; elaborations of detail he had found within.

The &quot;Leucian Acts&quot; are as follows:

*The &quot;Acts of John&quot;
*The &quot;Acts of Peter&quot;
*The &quot;Acts of Paul&quot;
*The &quot;Acts of Andrew&quot;
*The &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot;
== Reported beliefs ==
Heterodoxy

Certain passages within the Leucian writings suggest a docetic or modalist view of Christ and the trinity. The inconsistency of the Christological language used within the texts either suggests that the works are indeed authored by multiple writers with differing views on the trinity, or that they are authored by someone with emphasis on narrative storytelling but very little theological education.

Before the discovery of the Gnostic texts in the Nag Hammadi codex, scholars believed that the Leucian acts were Gnostic writings, however modern scholars with access to the Nag Hammadi codex reject this, as it does not bare the distinct dualism or esoteric terminology of genuine Gnostic writings such as the Apocryphon of John or the Gospel of Judas.

Statements on the Crucifixion

Regarding the historical crucifixion of Jesus, Photios of Constantinople references a report attributed to Leucius Charinus:&quot;He said that Christ was not crucified, but another in his place, while he himself laughed at the mistake of the executioners.&quot;Leucius&#x27; statements are sometimes used in Islamic polemics against Christianity as this account is similar to the narrative of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion in Islam.

In the Islamic holy text, the Quran. The Quranic narrative in Surah 4:157 states:&quot;They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared so to them. Indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.&quot;Later Islamic scholars of both the Sunni and Shia factions expanded on this tradition. According to the account of the historian al-Tabari (839–923), a leader among the Jews, Yesûʿa, was mistakenly crucified in place of ʿĪsā (Jesus). Tabari recounts that God caused Yesûʿa to resemble ʿĪsā, leading to confusion among those present. While Yesûʿa protested his identity, the crowd crucified him, believing he was ʿĪsā. Meanwhile, ʿĪsā was raised to heaven to remain there until his second coming. Some Muslim sects, such as the Ahmadiyya community, reject this narrative, offering their own expansion on Jesus&#x27; death.

Despite this, the crucifixion of Jesus, along with the baptism of Jesus is considered one of the two historical facts about Jesus&#x27; life and is considered a definite fact, not contended by any mainstream scholars.

== Possible mention in the Acts of Pilate ==
In another apocryphal work, the Acts of Pilate (also known as the Gospel of Nicodemus), two men named Leucius and Charinus are said to be raised from the dead following the crucifixion. These men reportedly testify before the Jewish Sanhedrin, describing how the &quot;Good Thief&quot; (referred to here as Dismas) accompanied Christ through death into the limbo of Hell, where Christ delivered the righteous Old Testament saints.

The mention of Leucius and Charinus stands out, as no explanation is provided for their inclusion in this narrative. Furthermore, the Acts of Pilate is generally dated about a century later than the Leucian acts, raising questions about the connection between the two texts and the significance of these names.

<doc id="632954" wikidata="Q3429299" url="?curid=632954" title="Oholah and Oholibah">
<text>In the Hebrew Bible, Oholah () and Oholibah () (or Aholah and Aholibah in the King James Version and Young&#x27;s Literal Translation) are pejorative personifications given by the prophet Ezekiel to the cities of Samaria in the Kingdom of Israel and Jerusalem in the kingdom of Judah, respectively. They appear in chapter 23 of the Book of Ezekiel.

There is a pun in these names in the Hebrew. means &quot;her tent&quot;, and means &quot;my tent is in her.&quot;

The Hebrew prophets frequently compared the sin of idolatry to the sin of adultery, in a reappearing rhetorical figure. Ezekiel&#x27;s rhetoric directed against these two allegorical figures depicts them as lusting after Egyptian men in explicitly sexual terms in Ezekiel 23:20–21:

==23:44==
There are many opinions available on a detail of translation. &quot;&#x27;He went in to her as to a harlot, indeed they have gone in to Oholah and Oholibah אשח of wickedness.&#x27; The easiest and perhaps correct solution to the difficulty of the anomalous אשח in this verse is to assume the text is corrupt and emend it.&quot; Most translators chose synonyms for harlot.

==Catharism==

In the divergent theology of the Cathars, the heterodox Christian movement thriving in the 12th to 14th centuries, Oholah and Oholibah inspired the belief that the Cathar &quot;Invisible Father&quot; had two spiritual wives, Collam and Hoolibam.

<doc id="632975" wikidata="Q5149215" url="?curid=632975" title="Colour sergeant">
<text>Colour sergeant (CSgt or C/Sgt) is a rank of non-commissioned officer found in several armies and marine corps.

== Australia ==
In the Australian Army, the rank of colour sergeant has only existed in the Corps of Staff Cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon.

==Canada==
Colour sergeant is a rank in the Foot Guards regiments of the Canadian Army, specifically in the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards and the Canadian Grenadier Guards and also previously in The Canadian Guards. It is the equivalent to warrant officer; a colour sergeant wears the rank insignia of a warrant officer (a royal crown) on all uniforms except No. 1 Ceremonial Dress, on which a special rank badge is worn: three chevrons, point down, surmounted by an image of regimental colours.

Canadian colour sergeants are addressed in the same manner as their British counterparts.

==United Kingdom==

Colour sergeant (CSgt or C/Sgt) is a non-commissioned title in the Royal Marines and infantry regiments of the British Army, ranking above sergeant and below warrant officer class 2. It has a NATO ranking code of OR-7 and is equivalent to the rank of staff sergeant in other branches of the Army, flight sergeant or chief technician in the Royal Air Force, and chief petty officer in the Royal Navy. The insignia is the monarch&#x27;s crown above three downward pointing chevrons.
The rank was introduced into British Army infantry regiments in 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars to reward long-serving sergeants; a single colour sergeant was appointed to each company as the senior NCO. From 1 October 1913, British infantry battalions were reorganised from eight companies to four, leaving two colour sergeants in each new company. The senior of the pair was appointed to the new rank of company sergeant major and the junior to that of company quartermaster sergeant. Although the rank of colour sergeant was then abolished, the CQMS of an infantry company continued to be generally addressed as &quot;Colour Sergeant&quot; and the rank was later reintroduced, probably during the Second World War, with CQMS becoming an appointment of it. The Royal Marines retained the rank throughout.

Historically, colour sergeants of British line regiments protected ensigns, the most junior officers who were responsible for carrying their battalions&#x27; colours to rally troops in battles. For this reason, to reach the rank of colour sergeant was considered a prestigious attainment, granted normally to those sergeants who had displayed courage on the field of battle. This tradition continues today as colour sergeants form part of a colour party in military parades. During ceremonial events, it is from a colour sergeant that the ensign collects the colour of the battalion or regiment.

Colour sergeants are referred to and addressed as &quot;Colour Sergeant&quot; or &quot;Colour&quot; (&quot;Colour Sergeant Hewitt&quot; or &quot;Colour Hewitt&quot;, for instance) in the Army, or as &quot;Colour Sergeant&quot; or &quot;Colours&quot; in the Royal Marines, and never by the more junior rank of &quot;Sergeant&quot;. Unusually, NCOs with the rank of colour sergeant who hold the appointment of company quartermaster sergeant are still addressed and referred to by their rank, not their appointment. In Foot Guards regiments, colour sergeants are addressed as &quot;Sir&quot; and afforded the respect and privileges normally accorded to warrant officers. In The Rifles, the spelling &quot;colour serjeant&quot; is used, in common with other Rifles ranks and appointments including the word &quot;serjeant&quot;.

In the Royal Marines Band Service, the bandmasters of the seven Royal Navy Volunteer Bands usually hold the rank of band colour sergeant. The senior playing musician in a Royal Marines band also holds this rank, which replaced the rank of bandmaster in 1969.

Colour sergeants and warrant officers form an important part of the instructor cadre at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

==United States==

Color sergeant is an NCO rank that was used historically in the United States Army, most recently during World War I. Within the United States Military Academy at West Point, the term is used to distinguish second class cadets who are assigned to a colour party (one bearer per colour plus two guards).. In the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, the rank is given to 3rd year cadets that are members of the Regimental Color Guard, with the exception of the guard&#x27;s NCO-in-command, who holds the rank of cadet command color sergeant. All color sergeants in the VTCC must go through the guard&#x27;s joining process (Tap) again, even if they served as cadet color corporals on the guard as sophomores.

The term is used in the US Marine Corps as a billet for sergeants who carry the colours. Additionally, there is a billet of Color Sergeant of the Marine Corps, a sergeant (E5) who is the Commandant of the Marine Corps&#x27; ceremonial representative and the platoon sergeant of the Marine Corps Battle Colors Detachment.

<doc id="632980" wikidata="Q928751" url="?curid=632980" title="Nick Oliveri">
<text>Nick Steven Oliveri (born October 21, 1971) is an American multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter. He is best known as a former bassist of Kyuss and later Queens of the Stone Age from 1998 to 2004. Oliveri is also a solo artist and frequent contributor to his friends&#x27; albums and tours, including Winnebago Deal, Masters of Reality, Turbonegro, Moistboyz, Svetlanas and Big Scenic Nowhere among many others. He is currently the frontman of his project, Mondo Generator, a punk and metal hybrid that he formed in 1997, and the co-founder of the stoner rock power trio, Stöner. He has also worked periodically with the Dwarves since 1993.

== Early life ==
Nick Steven Oliveri was born in Los Angeles on October 21, 1971, and was then raised in Palm Springs from the age of 11. His first instrument was a guitar but he later moved to bass. His major influences were Kiss, Black Sabbath, Ramones, Rush and Van Halen. Oliveri was described by lifelong friend Brant Bjork as having a Spicoli-esque lifestyle growing up in his youth.

== Career ==

=== Kyuss ===

He began his career in 1987 as a guitarist, when he formed Katzenjammer with bandmates John Garcia, Josh Homme, Chris Cockrell and Brant Bjork. In early 1989, shortly after Oliveri&#x27;s departure, the band changed its name to Sons of Kyuss, and after self-releasing an EP in 1990, the band re-recruited Oliveri on bass to replace Cockrell, and shortened their name to Kyuss.

Oliveri left the band following completion of &quot;Blues for the Red Sun&quot; and was replaced by Scott Reeder, who had been approached about joining Kyuss five to six months earlier during a West Coast tour with The Obsessed. Following his departure from Kyuss, Oliveri joined the Dwarves as an on and off again bassist under the moniker &quot;Rex Everything&quot;.

=== Mondo Generator ===

Nick Oliveri (under the moniker &quot;Rex Everything&quot;) formed Mondo Generator in 1997 and with friends Josh Homme, Brant Bjork, Rob Oswald, Karl Doyle and others, recorded the debut album, &quot;Cocaine Rodeo&quot;. The album wouldn&#x27;t be released until three years later due to Oliveri and Homme being full-time members of Queens of the Stone Age. The album was released by cult-favorite Southern Lord Records in 2000. There was little support of the album by the way of live shows, and the band gained cult status among the most devoted Queens of the Stone Age fans.

As of April 2007, Mondo Generator was scheduled to appear on the 12th annual Ozzfest tour (otherwise known as the &quot;FreeFest&quot; tour), but officially dropped off the tour on July 26, 2007 after appearing at four Ozzfest dates. Oliveri stated, &quot;This year it was free for the crowd, which was a great thing, but essentially the bands were playing for free too and we just couldn&#x27;t afford to do that.&quot;

=== Queens of the Stone Age ===
Oliveri was a core contributor to Queens of the Stone Age from 1998 to 2004, playing bass and providing backup and lead vocals on two of the band&#x27;s biggest albums, &quot;Rated R&quot; and &quot;Songs for the Deaf,&quot; in addition to co-writing most of the album&#x27;s songs with bandmate Josh Homme. He first appeared on the band&#x27;s self titled debut album in the form of a voicemail confirming his commitment to the band on the album&#x27;s final song, &quot;I Was a Teenage Hand Model&quot;.

Oliveri&#x27;s lead singing can be heard on songs such as &quot;Auto Pilot&quot;, &quot;Tension Head&quot; and &quot;Quick and to the Pointless&quot; from &quot;Rated R&quot; and &quot;Another Love Song&quot;, &quot;Gonna Leave You&quot;, &quot;Six Shooter&quot; and &quot;You Think I Ain&#x27;t Worth a Dollar but I Feel Like a Millionaire&quot;, from &quot;Songs for the Deaf.&quot;

In January 2004, following a string of dates touring in Australia, Oliveri was fired from the band, with reasoning at first being aggressive treatment of the band&#x27;s fans, later being accusations of possible abuse to his girlfriend. Oliveri has said to have come to the conclusion himself that during a soundcheck at a show in Spain in 2003, he acted too aggressively to Josh Homme over his relationship with then-girlfriend Brody Dalle after getting too drunk on wine, raising tension between the two. In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio 1, Homme stated that he had approached Oliveri about the abuse rumors and told him, &quot;If I ever find out that this is true, I can’t know you, man.&quot; He also revealed an incident that occurred in the UK involving Oliveri and vocalist Mark Lanegan where the former &quot;almost didn&#x27;t make it out of the country.&quot;

=== Post-Queens of the Stone Age ===
Since his firing from Queens of the Stone Age, Oliveri has recorded an acoustic LP entitled &quot;Demolition Day&quot; that was eventually released as a second disc in the limited edition of the Mondo Generator album, &quot;Dead Planet: SonicSlowMotionTrails&quot;. In September 2006, Oliveri stated &quot;I feel that Queens is something I can contribute to and Josh Homme needs me to do it.&quot;

There was speculation that he would return in Queens of the Stone Age during their summer tour due to Josh Homme&#x27;s dedication of &quot;New Fang&quot; to Nick for &quot;new beginnings&quot;. However, this proved to be false. In March 2011, Oliveri stated: &quot;The last time I saw them play was a benefit for Brian O&#x27;Connor in L.A., from the Eagles of Death Metal. I was down there and I mentioned to them, &quot;Why don&#x27;t I come up and do &quot;Millionaire&quot; or something, and sing it and not play bass?&quot; [Josh] was like, &quot;Nah, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good idea yet.&quot; It&#x27;s kind of in his court for stuff like that. I don&#x27;t think he wants to give anybody the wrong idea. I don&#x27;t necessarily know if that would happen. And he&#x27;s got a good band—he&#x27;s taking the band in the direction he wants it to go.&quot;

In late November 2012, Oliveri contributed vocals on the track &quot;If I Had a Tail&quot; for his former band Queens of the Stone Age on their album &quot;…Like Clockwork&quot;. Upon hearing fellow former Queens member Dave Grohl would make a return to drums on the album, Oliveri inquired to Josh Homme if he could play bass: &quot;I actually put in a request with Josh. I heard Dave was playing on the record, and I was like, &#x27;Dude! I wanna play bass on it!&#x27; I&#x27;d be a fool not to ask. If Dave Grohl was playing drums, then I want in. He&#x27;s an amazing drummer. I never had a better time in my life than when Dave was in the band.&quot; Homme instead opted for current bassist Michael Shuman.

In April 2014, Moistboyz opened for Queens of the Stone Age at a concert at the Keller Auditorium in Portland, Oregon. Oliveri then joined Queens of the Stone Age on stage for the first time in over a decade to sing &quot;You Think I Ain&#x27;t Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire&quot;.

=== Kyuss Lives! ===

In June 2010, former Kyuss members Oliveri and Bjork joined Garcia onstage to perform &quot;Green Machine&quot; and &quot;Gardenia&quot; during a headlining appearance by &quot;Garcia Plays Kyuss&quot; at Hellfest in Clisson, France and they also appeared onstage with Garcia in other concerts on the tour.

In November 2010, Oliveri joined Kyuss Lives! with fellow ex band members Garcia and Bjork. The band initially toured Europe, Australian and New Zealand markets in early 2011, and later toured North America. A new studio album was also being planned following the tour. Due to Oliveri&#x27;s ongoing legal problems resulting from a July 2011 incident, he was unable to leave the US and Scott Reeder filled in for him on several international dates. After touring domestically in the US with Kyuss Lives! during 2011, Oliveri decided to leave the band in favor of returning to working on Mondo Generator.

However, in March 2012, it was revealed that Josh Homme, after persuading bassist Scott Reeder to support him, had filed a federal lawsuit against John Garcia and Brant Bjork alleging &quot;trademark infringement and consumer fraud&quot; over the use of the Kyuss name despite the fact Brant Bjork had originally created the name. Nick Oliveri left Kyuss later that month after it was revealed that Garcia and Bjork had tried to take control of the Kyuss trademark.

In December 2012, he announced his return to Kyuss Lives!, however all touring and promotions since have not featured Oliveri. In August 2013, singer John Garcia said that the band &quot;is a three-piece band with [himself], Brant [Bjork, drummer] and Bruno [Fevery, guitarist]. It always will be.&quot; and described Oliveri as &quot;an honorary band member&quot;.

=== Stöner ===

In 2020, Oliveri formed the stoner rock trio Stöner, along with former Kyuss bandmate Brant Bjork and Ryan Güt, touring member for Bjork&#x27;s live band. The band first appeared on Oliveri&#x27;s solo album &quot;N.O. Hits at All Vol.666&quot;. Stöner performed on the fourth volume of the &quot;Live in the Mojave Desert&quot; concert film series and live albums later in the year.

In 2021, the band released their debut album, &quot;Stoners Rule&quot; and embarked on a US tour alongside Clutch.

In 2022, Stöner released their sophomore album &quot;Totally...&quot;.

In 2023, the band released their debut EP, &quot;Boogie to Baja&quot;.

=== Additional projects and contributions ===
In 2005, Oliveri appeared on the Turbonegro album &quot;Party Animals&quot; as guest vocalist on the song &quot;Final Warning&quot;. He joined the band on stage for performances of the song during their US tour in 2007, which included Mondo Generator as support.

In early 2008, Oliveri joined a West Coast offshoot of Moistboyz dubbed Dickie Moist OTC, on bass. In June 2008, he joined Los Angeles-based rock band, The Knives, on bass.

On August 7, 2008, Oliveri appeared on stage with Turbonegro at Øyafestivalen in Oslo to sing &quot;Back to Dungaree High&quot; and &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;, the former being a song that Queens of the Stone Age had previously covered on the Turbonegro tribute album &quot;Alpha Motherfuckers&quot; and the latter a Black Flag cover. The band&#x27;s performance at the festival was the 10th anniversary celebration of their album &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot;. On April 19, 2009, Oliveri again joined Turbonegro on stage for the song &quot;Dungaree High&quot; during their Coachella set.

In 2010, Oliveri appeared on Slash&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Slash&quot;, contributing vocals to the track &quot;Chains and Shackles&quot; that was included on the Australian edition of the album.

Oliveri co-wrote the song &quot;TNA (The Nihilistic Army)&quot; with members of Turbonegro for their 2012 album &quot;Sexual Harassment&quot;.

In July 2013, while on tour in Alaska, Oliveri met members of Men With Guns, Lowell George Granath and Cody Kniceley, resulting in the formation of a band called The Situationalists and the recording of two demo tracks. An LP was planned, but did not materialize.

In late November 2013, Oliveri announced that he would be touring with, and playing bass for Moistboyz, the punk/rock project of Dean Ween, which featured then Mondo Generator drummer Hoss Wright, Guy Heller, and Stephen Haas. Oliveri later announced that he and Hoss were also providing the rhythm section for the reunited California thrash outfit Bl&#x27;ast!.

In 2015, Oliveri collaborated with Russian punk rock band Svetlanas and occasionally toured with the band. Their album, &quot;Naked Horse Rider&quot;, featured Oliveri and was recorded at Josh Homme&#x27;s Pink Duck Studios in California. Oliveri later appeared on the following Svetlanas releases, &quot;This Is Moscow Not L.A.&quot; in 2017, and &quot;Disco Sucks&quot; in 2020.

In November 2016, Oliveri announced the release of a series of compilations titled &quot;N.O. Hits at All&quot;, to be issued on Heavy Psych Sounds Records. Oliveri commented &quot;...Now for the first time, all these songs and bands I&#x27;ve recorded with over the past 25 years are together and available to you to trip out on. So get your head right, put this record on and play it loud!&quot; &quot;N.O. Hits at All Vol.1&quot; was issued on January 27, 2017. &quot;N.O. Hits at All Vol.2&quot; was issued on July 7, 2017. &quot;N.O. Hits at All Vol.3&quot; was released on October 20, 2017, a day before Oliveri&#x27;s birthday. &quot;N.O. Hits at All Vol.4&quot; was released on February 23, 2018. &quot;N.O. Hits at All Vol.5&quot; was released on October 12, 2018. &quot;N.O. Hits at All Vol.666&quot; was released on March 6, 2020. &quot;N.O. Hits at All Vol.7&quot; was released on July 2, 2021.

In 2019, Oliveri joined Desert Rock veterans Bob Balch (Fu Manchu) and Gary Arce (Yawning Man, Ten East) in the band Big Scenic Nowhere for the group&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;Dying on the Mountain&quot;. He again played for the band on their debut full-length album, &quot;Vision Beyond Horizon&quot;.

In 2020, Oliveri collaborated with the Italian rock band Gunash for the recording of the single &quot;Predators&quot; which appeared on both &quot;N.O. Hits at All Vol. 7&quot; and the Gunash album &quot;All You Can Hit&quot;. Gunash supported Nick Oliveri on his European &quot;Death Acoustic Tour&quot; and Mondo Generator on some dates in Italy and France.

== Legal issues and controversy ==
On July 10, 1999, Oliveri and Josh Homme were involved in an altercation with British rock band Terrorvision while Queens of the Stone Age were on tour in London. Oliveri was arrested as a result, but was released several hours later without being charged.

On January 19, 2001, Oliveri was arrested after a performance at Rock in Rio III in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for performing nude on stage. He apologized for the incident and stated that he was not aware that it was a crime in Brazil.

On July 12, 2011, Oliveri was arrested for suspicion of felony domestic violence after a standoff with police SWAT team. He allowed his girlfriend to exit the house two hours into the standoff and two hours before the SWAT team made entry into the home and arrested Oliveri. Drugs and a loaded rifle were found in the home. In August 2012, Oliveri&#x27;s lawyer reached a plea agreement with prosecutors in his case. His lawyer, Freddy Sayegh, told TMZ, &quot;Oliveri agreed to plead to one count of possession of cocaine and a dismissal of the remaining six felony counts.&quot; Oliveri&#x27;s record in the case will be expunged as long as he completes court-ordered community service, anger management, and remains out of trouble for six years.

== Pseudonyms ==
Oliveri adopted the &quot;Rex Everything&quot; moniker after shattering a vase at a former Dwarves bassist&#x27;s house, upon which he replied to Oliveri with &quot;Rex Everything&quot;. The nickname &quot;Rex&quot; was originally given to Oliveri by Blag Dahlia, but a last name, which became Everything, was needed to go along with it. 

&quot;Pierre Pressure&quot; was a nickname given to Oliveri by lifelong friend Josh Homme, to which Homme stated Oliveri pressures people into doing things they should not. &quot;The Great French Manipulator&quot; also came from Homme. 

&quot;Rock &amp; Roll Komodo Dragon&quot; originated from an interview with &quot;Revolver&quot; where Homme states that Oliveri&#x27;s &quot;a bit like a rock and roll komodo dragon, it&#x27;s been that way for thousands of years&quot;. 

&quot;Nikolai Svetlana&quot; was given during Oliveri&#x27;s tenure with Svetlanas, as each band member uses the band name as their stage last name.

<text>Grand Falls () is a town in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada, on the Saint John River. Its name comes from a waterfall created by a series of rock ledges over which the river drops .

On 1 January 2023, Grand Falls expanded to include Drummond, the rural community of Saint-André, the local service district of the parish of Grand Falls, and part of the LSD of the parish of Drummond. Revised census figures have not been released.

==History==

In 1686, Monsignor de Saint-Vallier (of Quebec) was the first known person to mention in writing the magnificent falls for which Grand Falls is named. His words describing the area can be found on a monument erected at the mouth of Davis Park in 1986. He recounts his trip to the region in 1686. He writes: &quot;On May 16 we arrived at a place called Grand Sault St-Jean-Baptiste. Here the river falls madly from a height of 60 feet, forming a huge waterfall that thick fog envelops the tumult of the falls far warns mariners descended in canoes. It also notes the presence of some French settlers in the region. In 1695, the territory between Grand Falls and Médoctec was granted the manor in Sieur Rene D&#x27;Amours. The French missionaries, Récollets, visited Great Falls in 1691 and Antoine de Lamothe Cadillac mentioned the presence of a fort in 1693. The latter was used to supply the passengers, who became more numerous from the Seven Years&#x27; War.

In 1763, the region fully passed into British hands and its French population diminished due to the Expulsion of the Acadians. In 1783, the Loyalists settled in Acadia and the province of New Brunswick was created the next year. In 1785, the Acadians in Fredericton and nearby were evicted from their land and in June 1785, a group decided to establish the region of Grand Falls and the rest of Madawaska and this with the agreement of the Maliseet people.

In 1791, Thomas Carleton, then Governor of New Brunswick, built a fort at Grand Falls. The Madawaska region was then disputed between Quebec, New Brunswick and the United States. The War of 1812 showed that the area&#x27;s roads were not safe and in 1875, the colonial government of New Brunswick decided to build a road from Woodstock to Grand Falls. In 1816, the government gave a grant to two settlers to settle between Grand Falls and Presque Isle. The territorial differences culminated in the Aroostook War in 1838 and Webster–Ashburton Treaty in 1842, gave Grand Falls to the province of New Brunswick. In 1838, James Brown and George Hayward visited Grand Falls and mentioned the presence of a sawmill owned by John Caldwell staffed by French Canadians and Acadians. In 1840, Lieutenant Cavalié Mercer, an Englishman stationed in Woodstock, made the first paintings of the city. In 1842, Grand Falls was included in Colebrook Township, named in honour of the Governor of New Brunswick, William MacBean George Colebrooke. The first survey was done for the British army in 1844 by the Deputy Gordon, while Colonel Beckwith designed the town plan. The survey was made from a large elm to the west, which has now disappeared. The lots were in turn divided into 1847 by the engineer C. Inches.

In 1904, Van Morrell, originally from the State of Maine, crossed the falls on a tightrope. The ring to which this rope was attached can still be found in O.B Davis Park

==Geography==

Grand Falls is located in the valley of the Saint John River, south of Madawaska, 55 kilometres southeast of Edmundston, on the Canada–United States border.

==Economy==

Three main industries reside in Grand Falls: potato farming, potato processing (The McCain frozen food plant) and tourism. The town is also a local commercial centre for Victoria County, catering to the surrounding communities of Plaster Rock, Perth Andover, Blue Bell, and New Denmark.

Tourism centres around the Saint John River’s falls and gorge located in the centre of town. Two tourist attractions line the river; the Malabeam Information Centre and La Rochelle. The Malabeam Centre faces the falls and is across the Grand Falls Farmers Market located on Madawaska Road. Through La Rochelle, you may access the 75-metre gorge via stairwell, which contains 401 steps. Near this location, you will find the Falls and Gorge Campground, which provides access to the Camel&#x27;s back, an impressive rock formation. All of these sites can be visited by following a 1.6KM walking path with the option of a guided tour that can be scheduled with the Malabeam Information Centre. 

The falls are also home to the Grand Falls Generating Station which provides electrical power by use of a hydro electric dam completed in 1931, and provides 66 MW of electricity through four Francis turbines.

The Grand Falls Public Library began as a small group of readers forming the Literary Club founded by Senator Muriel McQueen Fergusson. Members campaigned in 1948 to establish a formal library and the Grand Falls Public Library officially opened its doors for the first time on April 20, 1949. The library was housed in a small building located on Broadway Boulevard where now stands the Dari Delite Ice Cream Store and was once the old Post Office. In 1950, it then relocated further down the boulevard to the Anita Lagace building, which currently houses LP Godbout Insurance. In June 1972, the library moved a third time to the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission building. It also became incorporated into the Haut-Saint-Jean Library Region in the very same year. In August 1983, the library moved from Broadway Boulevard to the Masonic Hall on the corner of Sheriff and Church Street. Since January 1999, the Grand Falls Public Library has been located on Pleasant Street in the municipal building and it is still part of the Haut-Saint-Jean Library Region, one of the five regions of New Brunswick Public Library Service.

John Caldwell School&#x27;s first building, a two-story structure, was built on the site of the John Caldwell School in 1909. In 1951, a brick building was built on the same lot. It housed the industrial shops, gymnasium and home economics facilities. It was named the Grand Falls Composite High School. A wing was built in 1966, and in 1969 the name was changed to the John Caldwell School. In 1982, the original wooden building was demolished leaving only the new structure. In 1971, the school became a Junior High School and in 1981 it became the Junior-Senior High School for the anglophone students of the area with Richard Michaud serving as principal from 1966 to 1991. Major expansion began in 1989 to include the English elementary students making it a K-12 facility. Kevin Harding is the current principal.

<text>The Polish Round Table Talks took place in Warsaw, communist Poland, from 6 February to 5 April 1989. The government initiated talks with the banned trade union Solidarność and other opposition groups to defuse growing social unrest.

==History==
Following the factory strikes of the early 1980s and the subsequent formation of the (then still underground) Solidarity movement under the leadership of Lech Wałęsa, the political situation in Poland started relaxing somewhat. Despite an attempt by the government to crack down on trade unionism, the movement had gained too much momentum, and it became impossible to hold off change any more. In August 1988, the Polish People&#x27;s Republic authorities started a dialogue with the opposition under the influence of multiple internal and external factors. The main reasons were the many social protests, lasting from May 1988 in different regions of Poland, the increasing crisis of the Polish economy, the pressure of the Polish Catholic Church to begin negotiations with the opposition, support of the Western states for Solidarność, and simultaneous internal transformations of the USSR provoked by the politics of perestroika of Gorbaczev, ultimately decided about initiating the talks. Also the changes in the attitude of both ruling party and the opposition were vital to the process; the contemporary authorities knew that they need social permission to conduct required economic reforms, and for that reason, they wanted to share the political responsibility with Solidarność, whereas the opposition prioritized the need to reorganize public life over continuation of resisting the Polish United Workers Party (PZPR).

In September 1988, when a wave of strikes was ending, a secret meeting was held, which included Lech Wałęsa and Minister of Internal Affairs Czesław Kiszczak. They agreed to hold the so-called &quot;Round Table&quot; talks in the near future to plan out the course of action to be undertaken in the country. The Round Table talks began on 6 February 1989 at 14:23 CET. They included the &quot;&quot;Solidarity&quot;&quot; &quot;opposition&quot; side and the government (also referred to as the &quot;ruling coalition&quot; side due to participation in the talks of PZPR&#x27;s bloc parties, like United People&#x27;s Party (ZSL), Alliance of Democrats (SD), and other PZPR-dependent organizations). The talks were held in the Council of Ministers Office. Wałęsa and Kiszczak co-chaired the meetings.

The Polish communists, led by General Jaruzelski, hoped to co-opt prominent opposition leaders into the ruling group without significantly changing the political power structure. In reality, the talks radically altered the shape of the Polish government and society. The events in Poland precipitated and gave momentum to the fall of the entire European communist bloc; the Yalta arrangement collapsed soon after the events in Poland.

==Sessions==
The sessions were divided into three main committees:
*Political reforms committee
*Trade unions pluralism committee
*Economy and social politics committee
Alongside main committees subcommittees and working groups were established:

* Subcommittees:
** Subcommittee on ecology 
** Subcommittee on mining
** Subcommittee on housing policy 
** Subcommittee on youth affairs 
** Subcommittee on science, education and technical progress
** Subcommittee on law and court reforms
** Subcommittee on agriculture 
** Subcommittee on mass media 
** Subcommittee on associations and local government
** Subcommittee on healthcare
* Working groups:
** Working group on wage and income indexation
** Working group on property rights of trade unions
** Working group on amending the Trade Union Act
** Working group on local government
** Working group on associations
** Working group on assumptions for the draft act on the rights of certain employees to re-establish an employment relationship
** Working group on the act on trade unions of individual farmers.

Specific issues were handled by these work groups, although meetings often ground to a halt. This was caused by a mutual distrust of the factions and an obvious unwillingness of the government faction to relinquish power. The most controversial questions were:
*Pay raises and indexation
*Future pluralist elections
*The limit of the future president&#x27;s competence
*The limit of competence for the future parliament
*The access to mass communication media by opposition forces

Principal negotiators of the governing coalition and the opposition camp were chosen by their leaders; respectively Wojciech Jaruzelski (although he did not participate in the talks), Mieczysław Rakowski, Józef Czyrek and Stanisław Ciosek, and then Lech Wałęsa and Henryk Wujec. It is essential to notice that both parties maintained a sense of high legitimacy during the conversations; Solidarność based on representing the society and transparent informing the broad public about the course of the talks, whereas the authorities based on holding the real power and belief that they still represent the interests of a vital part of the society. The most important topics of negotiations were future elections, the position of the president, Senate, practical reforms of the state&#x27;s structure, and bringing back free associations and unions.

Several radical opposition organizations opposed the talks as they did not believe in the good intentions of the sitting government. Despite their fears, several critical documents were signed after the sessions on 5 April. These documents became known as the Round Table Agreement.

== Participants ==
Throughout talks almost 452 people participated in it. Many participants of the talks afterwards held important positions. Among them were three future presidents (Lech Wałęsa, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Lech Kaczyński), five prime ministers (Czesław Kiszczak, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Jan Olszewski, Leszek Miller, Jarosław Kaczyński), four deputy prime ministers, six marshals and deputy marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, over 75 ministers and deputy ministers, about 100 MPs and the First President of the Supreme Court (Adam Strzembosz).

*The formation of a Senate

As a result, real political power was vested in a newly created bicameral legislature and in a president who would be the chief executive. Solidarność became a legitimate and legal political party. Free election to 35% of the seats in Sejm and an entirely free election to the Senate was assured.

The Round Table Agreement also brought more plurality in public media. It allowed for the creation of a first, fully independent journal ‘Gazeta Wyborcza’, whose first edition was published on May 8, 1989. The politicians of the opposition were invited to the national public media, and the spots of Solidarność were released in public television. Simultaneously, Solidarność started to publish their own weekly newspaper ‘Tygodnik Solidarności’, whose editor-in-chief became Tadeusz Mazowiecki.

The election of 4 June 1989 brought a landslide victory to Solidarność: 99% of all the seats in the Senate and all of the 35% possible seats in Sejm. Jaruzelski, whose name was the only one the PZPR allowed on the ballot for the presidency, won by just one vote in the National Assembly. The 65–35 division was soon abolished as well, after the first truly free Sejm elections.

==Criticism==
Andrzej Gwiazda, who was one of the leaders of the so-called &quot;First Solidarity&quot; (August 1980 – December 1981), claims that the Round Table Agreement and the negotiations that took place before it at a Communist government&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior and Administration (Poland) conference center (late 1988 and early 1989) in the village of Magdalenka had been arranged by Moscow. According to Gwiazda, who himself did not take part in the negotiations, the Soviets &quot;carefully selected a group of opposition activists, who passed on as representatives of the whole [Polish] society, and made a deal with them&quot;.

This notion was supported by Anna Walentynowicz, who in an interview given in 2005 stated that the Agreement was a &quot;success of the Communists, not of the nation&quot;. According to Walentynowicz, Czesław Kiszczak and Wojciech Jaruzelski, who initiated the negotiations, &quot;safeguarded their own safety and (...) influence on the government&quot;. Walentynowicz claims that the talks were organized so that in the future, &quot;no Communist criminal, murderer or thief would pay for their crimes&quot;.

Antoni Macierewicz regards the negotiations and the agreement as a &quot;classic Soviet plot of the secret services&quot;. In his opinion, both Kiszczak and Jaruzelski were &quot;at every stage controlled by their Soviet overseers (...) and their autonomy was minimal&quot;. As Macierewicz said in February 2009, the Round Table was a &quot;tactical success of the parts of the elites, but from the point of view of national interests of Poland, it was a failure&quot;.

Piotr Bączek of Gazeta Polska weekly wrote that in the mid-1980s, the so-called Communist &quot;Team of three&quot; (Jerzy Urban, General Władysław Pożoga and Stanisław Ciosek), suggested that among opposition activists, &quot;search for people, who are politically available&quot; should be initiated, as &quot;yesterday&#x27;s opponent, drawn into the power, becomes a zealous ally&quot;. In June 1987 Mieczysław Rakowski, in a report handed to General Jaruzelski, wrote that a &quot;change in the attitude towards the opposition must be initiated (...) Maybe, out of numerous oppositional fractions, one movement would be selected and allowed to participate in the governing&quot;, wrote Rakowski. Bączek&#x27;s opinion is backed by Filip Musiał, a historian of Kraków&#x27;s office of Institute of National Remembrance. In June 2008 Musiał stated that the &quot;Team of three&quot; was ordered to find a solution to a problem, which troubled Communist government of Poland. Economic situation of the country was worsening in the late 1980s, and the threat of social unrest was real. At the same time, the Communists did not want to relinquish power, so they prepared, in Musiał&#x27;s words, &quot;a political marketing operation&quot;.

Musiał says that General Czesław Kiszczak himself decided which oppositional activists were &quot;politically available&quot; – the condition was that the candidates had to be supportive of &quot;evolution&quot; of the system, not its &quot;radical rejection&quot;. Therefore, most opposition activists, who took part in the negotiations, were those who at different points of their lives were close to the &quot;Marxist doctrine&quot; or belonged to the Communist party. Furthermore, all participants were carefully scrutinized by the secret services. As a result, Poland was &quot;the first Eastern Europe country, in which talks were initiated, but the last, in which completely free elections were organized, in the fall of 1991&quot;. The first prime minister after this election, Jan Olszewski, said that &quot;basic issues had been settled before [the talks], and the negotiations at the Round Table were about secondary matters&quot;.

<text>Pranayama (Sanskrit: प्राणायाम, &quot;Prāṇāyāma&quot;) is the yogic practice of focusing on breath. In yoga, the breath is associated with &quot;prana&quot;, thus, pranayama is a means to elevate the &quot;prana-shakti&quot;, or life energies. Pranayama is described in Hindu texts such as the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot;. Later, in Hatha yoga texts, it meant the complete suspension of breathing. The pranayama practices in modern yoga as exercise differ from those of the Hatha yoga tradition.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Prāṇāyāma&quot; (Devanagari: &quot;) is a Sanskrit compound. It is defined variously by different authors.

Macdonell gives the etymology as prana (&quot;), breath, + &quot;āyāma&quot; and defines it as the suspension of breath.

Monier-Williams defines the compound &#x27; as &quot;of the three &#x27;breath-exercises&#x27; performed during (&quot;See&quot; &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;&quot;. This technical definition refers to a particular system of breath control with three processes as explained by Bhattacharyya: &#x27; (to take the breath inside), &#x27; (to retain it), and &quot;&quot; (to discharge it). There are other processes of prāṇāyāma besides this three-step model.

V. S. Apte&#x27;s definition of &#x27; derives it from &#x27; + &#x27; and provides several variant meanings for it when used in compounds. The first three meanings have to do with &quot;length&quot;, &quot;expansion, extension&quot;, and &quot;stretching, extending&quot;, but in the specific case of use in the compound &#x27; he defines &quot;&quot; as meaning &quot;restrain, control, stopping&quot;.

Ramamurti Mishra gives the definition:

== Hinduism ==

=== &quot;Bhagavad Gītā&quot; ===

Pranayama is mentioned in verse 4.29 of the &quot;Bhagavad Gītā&quot;, which states &quot;Still others, who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance, practice by offering the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming, and the incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing. Others, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself as a sacrifice.&quot;

=== &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; ===

Pranayama is the fourth &quot;limb&quot; of the eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga, as mentioned in verse 2.29 of the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot;. Patanjali, a Rishi, discusses his specific approach to pranayama in verses 2.49 through 2.51, and devotes verses 2.52 and 2.53 to explaining the benefits of the practice. Patanjali does not fully elucidate the nature of prana, and the theory and practice of pranayama seem to have undergone significant development after him.

In verse 1.34, pranayama is introduced as a method aimed at stabilizing the mind. The practice involves two primary techniques: exhalation, known as &quot;pracchardana&quot;, which entails expelling air from the stomach through the nostrils, and retention, &quot;known as vidharana&quot;, which focuses on the controlled restraint of breath. Pranayama supports advanced practitioners in gaining control over the mind and complements meditation, aiding in achieving a light body and steady mind by regulating breath.

Yoga teachers including B. K. S. Iyengar have advised that pranayama should be part of an overall practice that includes the other limbs of Patanjali&#x27;s Raja Yoga teachings, especially Yama, Niyama, and Asana.

=== Hatha yoga ===

The Indian tradition of Hatha yoga makes use of various pranayama techniques. The 15th century &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; is a key text of this tradition and includes various forms of pranayama such as Kumbhaka breath retention and various body locks (Bandhas). Other forms of pranayama breathing include the alternate nostril breathing of Nadi Shodhana, Ujjayi breath (&quot;Victorious Breath&quot;), Sitali (breathing through the rolled tongue), Bhastrika (&quot;Bellows Breath&quot;), Kapalabhati (&quot;Skull-shining Breath&quot;, a Shatkarma purification), Surya Bhedana (&quot;Sun-piercing Breath&quot;), and the soothing Bhramari (buzzing like a bee).
B. K. S. Iyengar cautions that pranayama should only be undertaken when one has a firmly established yoga practice and then only under the guidance of an experienced Guru.

According to Theos Bernard, the ultimate aim of pranayama is the suspension of breathing (kevala kumbhaka), &quot;causing the mind to swoon&quot;. Paramahansa Yogananda writes, &quot;The real meaning of Pranayama, according to Patanjali, the founder of Yoga philosophy, is the gradual cessation of breathing, the discontinuance of inhalation and exhalation&quot;.

=== Yoga as exercise ===

The yoga scholar Andrea Jain states that pranayama was &quot;marginal to the most widely cited sources&quot; before the 20th century, and that the breathing practices were &quot;dramatically&quot; unlike the modern ones. She writes that while pranayama in modern yoga as exercise consists of synchronising the breath with movements (between asanas), in texts like the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot;, pranayama meant &quot;complete cessation of breathing&quot;, for which she cites Bronkhorst 2007.

== Buddhism ==

According to the Pali Buddhist Canon, the Buddha, prior to his enlightenment, practiced a meditative technique involving pressing the palate with the tongue and forcibly attempting to restraining the breath. This is described as both extremely painful and not conducive to enlightenment. In some Buddhist teachings or metaphors, breathing is said to stop with the fourth jhana, though this is a side effect of the technique and does not result from purposeful effort.

The Buddha did incorporate moderate modulation of the length of breath as part of the preliminary tetrad in the Anapanasati Sutta. Its use there is preparation for concentration. According to commentarial literature, this is appropriate for beginners.

=== Indo-Tibetan tradition ===

Later Indo-Tibetan developments in Buddhist pranayama which are similar to Hindu forms can be seen as early as the 11th century, in the Buddhist text titled the &quot;Amṛtasiddhi&quot;, which teaches three bandhas in connection with yogic breathing (kumbakha).

Tibetan Buddhist breathing exercises such as the &quot;nine breathings of purification&quot; or the &quot;Ninefold Expulsion of Stale Vital Energy&quot; (&quot;rlung ro dgu shrugs&quot;), a form of alternate nostril breathing, commonly include visualizations. In the Nyingma tradition of Dzogchen these practices are collected in the textual cycle known as &quot;The Oral Transmission of Vairotsana&quot; (&quot;Vai ro snyan brgyud&quot;).

== Effects ==

Yoga has positive effects on blood pressure, heart rate variability, and baroreflex sensitivity. In a systematic review of yoga breathing exercises and blood pressure, a moderate but statistically significant beneficial effect was found. A meta-analysis of &quot;voluntary slow breathing&quot;, heart rate, and heart rate variability found that such breathing leads to an increase in the parasympathetic nervous control of the heart, and notes &quot;By considering the importance of the parasympathetic nervous system for health-related issues, stimulating non-invasively the vagus nerve represents a valid target.&quot;

<doc id="632992" wikidata="Q1119094" url="?curid=632992" title="Paley–Wiener theorem">
<text>In mathematics, a Paley–Wiener theorem is a theorem that relates decay properties of a function or distribution at infinity with analyticity of its Fourier transform. It is named after Raymond Paley (1907–1933) and Norbert Wiener (1894–1964) who, in 1934, introduced various versions of the theorem. The original theorems did not use the language of distributions, and instead applied to square-integrable functions. The first such theorem using distributions was due to Laurent Schwartz. These theorems heavily rely on the triangle inequality (to interchange the absolute value and integration).

The original work by Paley and Wiener is also used as a namesake in the fields of control theory and harmonic analysis; introducing the [[Jensen%27s_formula#Applications|Paley–Wiener condition]] for spectral factorization and the [[Riesz_sequence#Paley-Wiener_criterion|Paley–Wiener criterion]] for non-harmonic Fourier series respectively. These are related mathematical concepts that place the decay properties of a function in context of stability problems.

==Holomorphic Fourier transforms==
The classical Paley–Wiener theorems make use of the holomorphic Fourier transform on classes of square-integrable functions supported on the real line. Formally, the idea is to take the integral defining the (inverse) Fourier transform

:formula_1

and allow formula_2 to be a complex number in the upper half-plane. One may then expect to differentiate under the integral in order to verify that the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold, and thus that formula_3 defines an analytic function. However, this integral may not be well-defined, even for formula_4 in formula_5; indeed, since formula_2 is in the upper half plane, the modulus of formula_7 grows exponentially as formula_8; so differentiation under the integral sign is out of the question. One must impose further restrictions on formula_4 in order to ensure that this integral is well-defined.

The first such restriction is that formula_4 be supported on formula_11: that is, formula_12. The Paley–Wiener theorem now asserts the following: The holomorphic Fourier transform of formula_4, defined by

:formula_14

for formula_2 in the upper half-plane is a holomorphic function. Moreover, by Plancherel&#x27;s theorem, one has

:formula_16

and by dominated convergence, 

:formula_17

Conversely, if formula_3 is a holomorphic function in the upper half-plane satisfying

:formula_19

then there exists formula_12 such that formula_3 is the holomorphic Fourier transform of formula_4.

In abstract terms, this version of the theorem explicitly describes the Hardy space formula_23. The theorem states that

:formula_24

This is a very useful result as it enables one to pass to the Fourier transform of a function in the Hardy space and perform calculations in the easily understood space 
formula_25 of square-integrable functions supported on the positive axis.

By imposing the alternative restriction that formula_4 be compactly supported, one obtains another Paley–Wiener theorem. Suppose that formula_4 is supported in formula_28, so that formula_29. Then the holomorphic Fourier transform

:formula_30

is an entire function of exponential type formula_31, meaning that there is a constant formula_32 such that

:formula_33

and moreover, formula_3 is square-integrable over horizontal lines:

:formula_35

Conversely, any entire function of exponential type formula_31 which is square-integrable over horizontal lines is the holomorphic Fourier transform of an 
formula_37 function supported in formula_28.

==Schwartz&#x27;s Paley–Wiener theorem==
Schwartz&#x27;s Paley–Wiener theorem asserts that the Fourier transform of a distribution of compact support on formula_39 is an entire function on formula_40 and gives estimates on its growth at infinity. It was proven by Laurent Schwartz (1952). The formulation presented here is from .

Generally, the Fourier transform can be defined for any tempered distribution; moreover, any distribution of compact support formula_41 is a tempered distribution. If formula_41 is a distribution of compact support and formula_3 is an infinitely differentiable function, the expression

:formula_44

is well defined.

It can be shown that the Fourier transform of formula_41 is a function (as opposed to a general tempered distribution) given at the value formula_46 by

:formula_47

and that this function can be extended to values of formula_46 in the complex space formula_40. This extension of the Fourier transform to the complex domain is called the Fourier–Laplace transform.

Additional growth conditions on the entire function formula_4 impose regularity properties on the distribution formula_41. 
For instance:

Sharper results giving good control over the singular support of formula_41 have been formulated by . In particular, let formula_53 be a convex compact set in formula_39 with supporting function formula_55, defined by

:formula_56 

Then the singular support of formula_41 is contained in formula_53 if and only if there is a constant formula_59 and sequence of constants formula_60 such that

:formula_61

for formula_62

<text>Blues rock is a fusion genre and form of rock music that relies on the chords/scales and instrumental improvisation of blues. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock (electric guitar, electric bass guitar, drums, and sometimes with keyboards and harmonica). From its beginnings in the early to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced hard rock, Southern rock, and early heavy metal.

Blues rock started with rock musicians in the United Kingdom and the United States performing American blues songs. They typically recreated electric Chicago blues songs, such as those by Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, and Jimmy Reed, at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock. In the UK, the style was popularized by groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, who put several blues songs into the pop charts. In the US, Lonnie Mack, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and Canned Heat were among the earliest exponents. Some of these bands also played long, involved improvisations as were then commonplace on jazz records. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the style became more hard rock-oriented. In the US, Johnny Winter, the early Allman Brothers Band, and ZZ Top represented a hard rock trend, along with Led Zeppelin, Ten Years After, Chicken Shack, and Foghat in the UK.

Along with hard rock, blues rock songs became the core of the music played on album-oriented rock radio in the United States, and later the classic rock format established there during the 1980s.

== Characteristics ==
Blues rock can be characterized by bluesy improvisation, extended boogie jams typically focused on electric guitar solos, and often a heavier, riff-oriented sound and feel to the songs than found in typical Chicago-style blues. Blues rock bands &quot;borrow[ed] the idea of an instrumental combo and loud amplification from rock &amp; roll&quot;. It is also often played at a fast tempo, again distinguishing it from the blues.

Blues rock songs often follow typical blues structures, such as twelve-bar blues, sixteen-bar blues, etc. They also use the I-IV-V progression, though there are exceptions, some pieces having a &quot;B&quot; section, while others remain on the I. The Allman Brothers Band&#x27;s version of &quot;Stormy Monday&quot;, which uses chord substitutions based on Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland&#x27;s 1961 rendition, adds a solo section where &quot;the rhythm shifts effortlessly into an uptempo 6/8-time jazz feel&quot;. The key is usually major, but can also be minor, such as in &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;.

One notable difference is the frequent use of a straight eighth-note or rock rhythm instead of triplets usually found in blues. An example is Cream&#x27;s &quot;Crossroads&quot;. Although it was adapted from Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot;, the bass &quot;combines with drums to create and continually emphasize continuity in the regular metric drive&quot;.

== 1960s–1970s ==

Rock music uses driving rhythms and electric guitar techniques such as distortion and power chords already used by 1950s electric blues guitarists, particularly Memphis bluesmen such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson and Pat Hare. Characteristics that blues rock adopted from electric blues include its dense texture, basic blues band instrumentation, rough declamatory vocal style, heavy guitar riffs, string-bending blues-scale guitar solos, strong beat, thick riff-laden texture, and posturing performances. Precursors to blues rock included the Chicago blues musicians Elmore James, Albert King, and Freddie King, who began incorporating rock and roll elements into their blues music during the late 1950s to early 1960s.

1963 marked the appearance of American rock guitar soloist Lonnie Mack, whose idiosyncratic, fast-paced electric blues guitar style came to be identified with the advent of blues rock as a distinct genre. His instrumentals from that period were recognizable as blues or rhythm and blues tunes, but he relied heavily upon fast-picking techniques derived from traditional American country and bluegrass genres. The best-known of these are the 1963 &quot;Billboard&quot; hit singles &quot;Memphis&quot; and &quot;Wham!&quot;. Around the same time, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was formed. Fronted by blues harp player and singer Paul Butterfield, it included two members from Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s touring band, bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay, and later two electric guitarists, Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop. In 1965, its debut album, &quot;The Paul Butterfield Blues Band&quot; was released. AllMusic&#x27;s Michael Erlewine commented, &quot;Used to hearing blues covered by groups like the Rolling Stones, that first album had an enormous impact on young (and primarily White) rock players.&quot; The second album &quot;East West&quot; (1966) introduced extended soloing – the 13 minute instrumental title track included jazz and Indian raga influences – that served as a model for psychedelic and acid rock. In 1965, avid blues collectors Bob Hite and Alan Wilson formed Canned Heat. Their early recordings focused heavily on electric versions of Delta blues songs, but soon began exploring long musical improvisations (&quot;jams&quot;) built around John Lee Hooker songs. Other popular mid-1960s groups, such as the Doors and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, also adapted songs by blues artists to include elements of rock. Butterfield, Canned Heat, and Joplin performed at the Monterey (1967) and Woodstock (1969) festivals.

In the UK, several musicians honed their skills in a handful of British blues bands, primarily those of Cyril Davies and Alexis Korner. While the early British rhythm and blues groups, such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, incorporated American R&amp;B, rock and roll, and pop, John Mayall took a more distinctly electric blues approach. In 1966, he released &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot;, the first of several influential blues rock albums. When Eric Clapton left Mayall to form Cream, they created a hybrid style with blues, rock, and jazz improvisation, which was the most innovative to date. British band Fleetwood Mac initially played traditionally-oriented electric blues, but soon evolved. Their guitarist Peter Green, who was Clapton&#x27;s replacement with Mayall, brought many innovations to their music. Chicken Shack, early Jethro Tull, Keef Hartley Band and Climax Blues Band recorded blues rock songs.

The electric guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix (a veteran of many American rhythm and blues and soul groups from the early-mid-1960s) and his power trios, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Band of Gypsys, had a broad and lasting influence on the development of blues rock, especially for guitarists. Clapton continued to explore several musical styles and contributed to bringing blues rock into the mainstream. In the late 1960s, Jeff Beck, with his band the Jeff Beck Group, developed blues rock into a form of heavy rock. Jimmy Page, who replaced Beck in the Yardbirds, followed suit with Led Zeppelin and became a major force in the 1970s heavy metal scene. Other blues rock musicians in the 1970s include Pat Travers, Rory Gallagher, Robin Trower and Roy Buchanan.

Beginning in the early 1970s, American bands such as Aerosmith fused blues with a hard rock edge. Blues rock grew to include Southern rock bands, like the Allman Brothers Band, ZZ Top and Lynyrd Skynyrd, while the British scene, except for the advent of groups such as Status Quo and Foghat, became focused on heavy metal innovation.

== 1980s–present ==
While blues rock and hard rock shared many similarities in the early 1970s, more traditional blues styles influenced blues rock in the 1980s. The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Georgia Satellites, and Robert Cray recorded their best-known works. Guitarists Gary Moore, Jeff Healey, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd became popular concert attractions in the 1990s. Female blues singers such as Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, Joanne Shaw Taylor, Beth Hart, Shannon Curfman, and Sue Foley recorded blues rock albums.

Musicians such as the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Ben Harper released alternative blues rock songs. Gary Clark Jr., known for his fusing of blues, rock and soul, has been classified as a blues rock artist, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jonathan Bernstein referring to Clark&#x27;s albums &quot;Blak and Blu&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Story of Sonny Boy Slim&quot; (2015) as &quot;steeped in a sleek, modern blues-rock production style&quot;.

Formed in 2017, Bulls of Prey is a successful Hungarian band in this genre. Popular blues rock performer Joe Bonamassa established Keeping the Blues Alive Records in 2020. Larry McCray, Robert Jon &amp; the Wreck, Joanna Connor and others, released music on the label. Dion also experienced several number one albums via KTBA.

<text>Animal World (Spanish original title: &quot;Mundo animal&quot;, 1953) is a collection of short stories written by Antonio di Benedetto, with hallucinatory animal transformations by the internationally acknowledged Argentine master.

== Summary ==
Written in conversational and even intentionally awkward language, they present a confused and troubled narrator, who, tormented by mysterious gnawings of guilt, becomes involved in some obscure way with an animal or whole group of animals. They invade his soul, drive him to rage or deliver him from his obsession. Often the story hinges on a pun, a distorted folktale, or an illogical association. While not spectacular in itself, each story adds to the preceding to create a growing sense of doom. Thus story by story the reader becomes ensnared in a horrifying, hallucinatory realm of associations.

<doc id="633000" wikidata="Q4704771" url="?curid=633000" title="Martensitic stainless steel">
<text>Martensitic stainless steels are a family of stainless steels having body-centered tetragonal (BCT) crystal structure and a predominately martensite structure. They are characterized by being magnetic and having the ability to be hardened through heat treatment. Martensitic stainless steels are designated as part of the 400-series of stainless steels in the SAE steel grades numbering system.

== History ==
In 1912, Harry Brearley of the Brown-Firth research laboratory in Sheffield, England, while seeking a corrosion-resistant alloy for gun barrels, discovered and subsequently industrialized a martensitic stainless steel alloy. The discovery was announced two years later in a January 1915 newspaper article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Brearly applied for a U.S. patent during 1915. This was later marketed under the &quot;Staybrite&quot; brand by Firth Vickers in England and was used for the new entrance canopy for the Savoy Hotel in 1929 in London.

The characteristic body-centered tetragonal martensite microstructure was first observed by German microscopist Adolf Martens around 1890. In 1912, Elwood Haynes applied for a U.S. patent on a martensitic stainless steel alloy. This patent was not granted until 1919.

== Overview ==
Martensitic stainless steels can be high- or low-carbon steels built around the composition of iron, 12% up to 17% chromium, carbon from 0.10% (Type 410) up to 1.2% (Type 440C): The chromium and carbon contents are balanced to have a martensitic structure. 

They may contain some nickel which allows a higher chromium or molybdenum content, thereby improving corrosion resistance and as the carbon content is also lower, the toughness is improved. Additions of boron, cobalt, niobium, and titanium improve the high temperature properties, particularly creep resistance. 

== Common grades ==
* Type 410 is a general purpose grade containing 0.15% maximum carbon.
* Type 420 increases the carbon content to 0.15% mininum for improved strength 
* Type 431 has added nickel content for improved corrosion resistance
* Types 440A, 440B and 440C increases the carbon content . Type 440C contains 0.95-1.20% carbon for highest hardness. Types 440B and 440A decreases the carbon content relative to Type 440C for improved toughness. 

== Properties ==

=== Corrosion resistance ===
Martensitic stainless steels are generally resistant to corrosion only in relatively mild environments and have lower corrosion resistance compared to austenitic stainless steels. 

=== Strength ===
Martensitic stainless alloys are hardenable by heat treatment, specifically by quenching and stress relieving, or by quenching and tempering (referred to as QT). The alloy composition, and the high cooling rate of quenching enable the formation of martensite. Untempered martensite is low in toughness and therefore brittle.Tempered martensite gives steel good hardness and high toughness as can be seen below, and is largely used for medical surgical instruments, such as scalpels, razors, and internal clamps. 

=== Physical properties ===
Martensitic stainless steels are ferromagnetic due to their BCT crystal structure. 

== Processing ==
When formability, softness, etc. are required in fabrication, steel having 0.12% maximum carbon is often used in soft condition. With increasing carbon, it is possible by hardening and tempering to obtain tensile strength in the range of , combined with reasonable toughness and ductility. In this condition, these steels find many useful general applications where mild corrosion resistance is required. Also, with the higher carbon range in the hardened and lightly tempered condition, tensile strength of about may be developed with lowered ductility.

Martensitic stainless steel can be nondestructively tested using the magnetic particle inspection method, unlike austenitic stainless steel.

==Applications==

Martensitic stainless steels, depending upon their carbon content and are often used for their corrosion resistance and high strength. They are also used for their wear resistance.

* Up to about 0.4% C they are used mostly for their mechanical properties in applications such as pumps, valves, and shafts.
* Above 0.4% C they are used mostly for their wear resistance, such as in cutlery, surgical blades, plastic injection molds, and nozzles.

Grade EN 1.4313 (CA6NM) is used for nearly all the hydroelectric turbines in the world, including those of the huge &quot;Three Gorges&quot; dam in China.

<text>James Young (13 July 1811 – 13 May 1883) was a Scottish chemist best known for his method of distilling paraffin from coal and oil shales. He is often referred to as Paraffin Young.

==Life==
James Young was born in Shuttle Street in the Drygate area of Glasgow, the son of John Young, a cabinetmaker and joiner, and his wife Jean Wilson.

He became his father&#x27;s apprentice at an early age, but educated himself at , attending evening classes in Chemistry at the nearby Anderson&#x27;s College (now Strathclyde University) from the age of 19. At Anderson&#x27;s College he met Thomas Graham, who had just been appointed as a lecturer on chemistry. In 1831 Young was appointed as Graham&#x27;s assistant and occasionally took some of his lectures. While at Anderson&#x27;s College he also met and befriended the explorer David Livingstone; this friendship continued until Livingstone&#x27;s death in Africa many years later.

On 21 August 1838 he married Mary Young of Paisley middle parish; in 1839 they moved to Lancashire.

He died at Kelly House at Wemyss Bay in western Scotland on 13 May 1883. He is buried in Inverkip churchyard.

==Career==
In Young&#x27;s first scientific paper, dated 4 January 1837, he described a modification of a voltaic battery invented by Michael Faraday. Later that same year he moved with Graham to University College, London where he helped him with experimental work.

===Chemicals===
In 1839 Young was appointed manager at James Muspratt&#x27;s chemical works Newton-le-Willows, near St Helens, Merseyside, and in 1844 to Tennants, Clow &amp; Co. at Manchester, for whom he devised a method of making sodium stannate directly from cassiterite.

===Potato blight===
In 1845 he served on a committee of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society for the investigation of potato blight, and suggested immersing the potatoes in dilute sulphuric acid as a means of combatting the disease; he was not elected a member of the Society until 19 October 1847. Finding the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; newspaper insufficiently liberal, he also began a movement for the establishment of the &quot;Manchester Examiner&quot; newspaper which was first published in 1846.

==Oils==
In 1847 Young had his attention called to a natural petroleum seepage in the Riddings colliery at Alfreton, Derbyshire from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery.

In 1848 Young left Tennants&#x27;, and in partnership with his friend and assistant Edward Meldrum, set up a small business refining the crude oil. The new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the sandstone roof of the coal mine, theorised that it somehow originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from this thought that it might be produced artificially.

Following up this idea, he tried many experiments and eventually succeeded in producing, by distilling cannel coal at a low heat, a fluid resembling petroleum, which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named &quot;paraffine oil&quot; because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.

==Patents==
The production of these oils and solid paraffin wax from coal formed the subject of his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young &amp; Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney &amp; Co. at Bathgate in West Lothian and E. Meldrum &amp; Co. at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works in the world, using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite, lamosite, and bituminous coal to manufacture naphtha and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.

In 1852 Young left Manchester to live in Scotland and that same year took out a US patent for the production of paraffin oil by distillation of coal. Both the US and UK patents were subsequently upheld in both countries in a series of lawsuits and other producers were obliged to pay him royalties. Torbanite was exceptionally rich, yielding 537 litres of petroleum spirit per tonne but it was a finite resource, which was completely exhausted by 1862. Geological surveys at the time showed the potential for similar sedimentary deposits in West Lothian, leading to the discovery of oil shales at Broxburn in 1858. The oil shales were less rich, typically yielding 150-180 litres per tonne, but the discovery meant that Young could extend his operations to West Lothian.

==Young&#x27;s Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Company==
In 1865 Young bought out his business partners and built second and larger works at Addiewell, near West Calder. It was a substantial industrial complex, in its time one of the largest chemical works in Scotland. In 1866 Young sold the concern to Young&#x27;s Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Company. Although Young remained in the company, he took no active part in it, instead withdrawing from business to occupy himself with yachting, travelling, scientific pursuits, and looking after the estates which he had purchased.

The company continued to grow and expanded its operations, selling paraffin oil and paraffin lamps all over the world and earning for its founder the nickname &quot;Paraffin&quot; Young. Addiewell remained the centre of operations for Young&#x27;s Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Co. Ltd.. By the 1900s nearly 2 million tons of shale were being extracted annually, employing 4,000 men. The West Lothian oil-shale industry peaked in around 1892 operating 120 oil shale works, but the end was approaching. Retorting the oil shale was energy intensive and expensive. Cheaper free-flowing petroleum from Russia and later the USA, effectively priced oil shales out of the market, causing the industry to almost collapse by 1919, long after Young himself had died. Young&#x27;s refinery closed around 1921.

==Other work==
*During the height of enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement, Young formed the 4th Linlithgowshire Rifle Volunteer Corps at Bathgate on 9 August 1862, mainly from employees of his chemical works, with Young himself as Captain in command until 1865. It later became D Company of the 8th Volunteer Battalion, Royal Scots.
*Young made significant discoveries in rustproofing ships in 1872, which were later adopted by the Royal Navy. Noticing that bilge water was acidic, he suggested that quicklime could be used to prevent it corroding iron ships.
* Young worked with Professor George Forbes on the speed of light around 1880, using an improved version of Hippolyte Fizeau&#x27;s method.

==Honours==
* In 1847 Young was elected to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.
* In 1861 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. (proposed by Lyon Playfair)
* From 1868–1877 he was President of Anderson&#x27;s College and founded the Young Chair of Technical Chemistry at the College.
* In 1873 Young was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
* In 1879 he was awarded an honorary doctorate (LLD) from St. Andrews University.
* From 1879–1881 he was Vice-President of the Chemical Society.

==Retirement and death==

Young&#x27;s wife died on 6 April 1868, and by 1871 he had moved with his children to Kelly House, near Wemyss Bay in the district of Inverkip. The 1881 census record shows him living with his son and daughter at this estate. Young died at the age of 71 in his home on 16 May 1883, in the presence of his son James. He was buried at Inverkip churchyard.

==Legacy==
*Statues of his old professor, Thomas Graham, and of his fellow student and lifelong friend, David Livingstone, which stand respectively in George Square, Glasgow, and at Glasgow Cathedral, were erected by him.
*From 1855 James &#x27;Paraffin&#x27; Young lived at Limefield House, Polbeth. A sycamore tree which Livingstone planted in 1864 is still flourishing in the grounds of Limefield House. There too one can see a miniature version of the &quot;Victoria Falls&quot;, which the missionary discovered in the mid-19th century. It was built, as a tribute to Livingstone, by Young on the little stream which runs through the estate.
* Young had a lifelong friendship with David Livingstone, whom he had met at Anderson&#x27;s College. He gave generously towards the expenses of Livingstone&#x27;s African expeditions, and contributed to a search expedition, which proved too late to find Livingstone alive. He also had Livingstone&#x27;s servants brought to Scotland, and presented to Glasgow a statue to his memory, which was erected in George Square, Glasgow.
*The James Young High School in Livingston, the streets James Young Road in Bathgate and James Young Avenue in Uphall Station, and the James Young Halls at the University of Strathclyde are all named after him.
*In 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.

<text>Hevea brasiliensis, the Pará rubber tree, &quot;sharinga&quot; tree, seringueira, or most commonly, rubber tree or rubber plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, originally native to the Amazon basin, but is now pantropical in distribution due to introductions. It is the most economically important member of the genus &quot;Hevea&quot; because the milky latex extracted from the tree is the primary source of natural rubber.

==Description==

&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot; is a tall deciduous tree growing to a height of up to in the wild. Cultivated trees are usually much smaller because drawing off the latex restricts their growth. The trunk is cylindrical and may have a swollen, bottle-shaped base. The bark is some shade of brown, and the inner bark oozes latex when damaged. The leaves have three leaflets and are spirally arranged. The inflorescences include separate male and female flowers. The flowers are pungent, creamy-yellow and have no petals. The fruit is a capsule that contains three large seeds; it opens explosively when ripe.

==Rubber tree plantation==

In the wild the tree can reach a height of up to . The white or yellow latex occurs in latex vessels in the bark, mostly outside the phloem. These vessels spiral up the tree in a right-handed helix which forms an angle of about 30 degrees with the horizontal, and can grow as high as .

In plantations the trees are generally smaller for two reasons: 1) trees grow more slowly when they are tapped for latex, and 2) trees are generally cut down after only 30 years, because latex production declines as trees age, and they are no longer economically productive. The tree requires a tropical or subtropical climate with a minimum of about per year of rainfall, and no frost. If frost does occur, the results can be disastrous for production. One frost can cause the rubber from an entire plantation to become brittle and break once it has been refined.

===Latex tapping===


The rubber tree takes between seven and ten years to deliver the first harvest.
Harvesters make incisions across the latex vessels, just deep enough to tap the vessels without harming the tree&#x27;s growth, and the latex is collected in small buckets. This process is known as rubber tapping. Latex production is highly variable from tree to tree and across clone types.

===Wood harvesting===
As latex production declines with age, rubber trees are generally felled when they reach the age of 25 to 30 years. The earlier practice was to burn the trees, but in recent decades, the wood has been harvested for furniture making.

==History==
The South American rubber tree grew only in the Amazon rainforest, and increasing demand and the discovery of the vulcanization procedure in 1839 led to the rubber boom in that region, enriching the cities of Belém, Santarém, and Manaus in Brazil and Iquitos, Peru, from 1840 to 1913. In Brazil, before the name was changed to &#x27;Seringueira&#x27; the initial name of the plant was &#x27;pará rubber tree&#x27;, derived from the name of the province of Grão-Pará. In Peru, the tree was called &#x27;árbol del caucho&#x27;, and the latex extracted from it was called &#x27;caucho&#x27;. The tree was used to obtain rubber by the natives who inhabited its geographical distribution. The Olmec people of Mesoamerica extracted and produced similar forms of primitive rubber from analogous latex-producing trees such as &quot;Castilla elastica&quot; as early as 3,600 years ago. The rubber was used, among other things, to make the balls used in the Mesoamerican ballgame. Early attempts were made in 1873 to grow &quot;H. brasiliensis&quot; outside Brazil. After some effort, 12 seedlings were germinated at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. These were sent to India for cultivation, but died. A second attempt was then made, some 70,000 seeds being smuggled to Kew in 1875, by Henry Wickham, in the service of the British Empire. About four percent of these germinated, and in 1876, about 2,000 seedlings were sent, in Wardian cases, to Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka) and 22 were sent to the botanic gardens in Singapore.

Once established outside its native country, rubber was extensively propagated in the British colonies. Rubber trees were brought to the botanical gardens at Buitenzorg, Java, in 1883. By 1898, a rubber plantation had been established in Malaya, with imported Chinese field workers being the dominant work force in rubber production in the early 20th-century.

The cultivation of the tree in South America (Amazon) ended early in the 20th century because of indigenous blights that targeted the rubber tree. The blight, called South American leaf blight, is caused by the ascomycete &quot;Pseudocercospora ulei&quot;, also called &quot;Microcyclus ulei&quot;, or &quot;Dothidella ulei&quot;, which is endemic to the Amazon Basin. The blight was considered one of the five most aggressive diseases in commercial crops in South America.
Rubber production then moved to parts of the world where it is not indigenous, and therefore not affected by local plant diseases. Today, most rubber tree plantations are in South and Southeast Asia, the top rubber producing countries in 2011 being Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, India and Vietnam.

==Environmental concerns==
The toxicity of arsenic to insects, bacteria, and fungi has led to the heavy use of arsenic trioxide on rubber plantations, especially in Malaysia.

The majority of the rubber trees in Southeast Asia are clones of varieties highly susceptible to the South American leaf blight—&quot;Pseudocercospora ulei&quot;. For these reasons, environmental historian Charles C. Mann, in his 2011 book, &quot;1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created&quot;, predicted that the Southeast Asian rubber plantations will be ravaged by the blight in the not-too-distant future, thus creating a potential calamity for international industry.

==Secondary metabolites==
&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot; produces cyanogenic glycosides (CGs) as a defense, concentrated in the seeds. (Although effective against other attackers, cyanogenic glycosides are not very effective against fungal pathogens. In rare cases, they are even detrimental. This is the case for the rubber tree, which actually suffers &quot;worse&quot; from &quot;Pseudocercospora ulei&quot; when it produces more cyanogenic glycosides. This may be because cyanide inhibits the production of other defensive metabolites. This results in significantly divergent subpopulations with selection for or against cyanogenic glycosides, depending on local likelihoods of fungal or non-fungal pest pressure.) The carbon and nitrogen in CGs are recycled for growth and latex production if needed, and the ease of doing so makes them an attractive nitrogen store - especially if the plant is light-deprived and storage in photosynthesis proteins would thus be unhelpful. The α-hydroxynitriles are likely contained in the cytoplasm. Linamarin is hydrolyzed by an accompanying linamarase, a β-glycosidase. &quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot; linamarase &quot;does&quot; act upon linamarin because it is a monoglucoside, while it does &quot;not&quot; for linustatin because it is a diglucoside - in fact, the production of lovastatin inhibits linamarase cleavage of linamarin. This allows intra-plant, post-synthesis transport of linustatin without risking premature cleavage.

<doc id="633020" wikidata="Q847821" url="?curid=633020" title="Ciao! Manhattan">
<text>Ciao! Manhattan is a 1972 American avant garde film starring Edie Sedgwick. Written and directed by John Palmer and David Weisman, Warhol superstar Susan Bottomly (International Velvet) was initially intended to star in the film. When Sedgwick was cast as her replacement the film came to center on a character resembling Sedgwick, dealing with the pain of addiction and the lure of fame.

==Overview==
&quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; is the semi-biographical tale of 1960s counterculture icon Edie Sedgwick. The film follows young Susan Superstar (Sedgwick) through her tumultuous party years in Manhattan as one of Warhol&#x27;s Superstars. Through actual audio recordings of Sedgwick&#x27;s account of her time in Warhol&#x27;s Factory in New York City, paired with clips from the original unfinished script started in 1967, &quot;Ciao!&quot; captures the complete deterioration of Sedgwick&#x27;s fictional alter-ego. The striking similarities between Sedgwick and Susan&#x27;s life story, especially when recounted by Sedgwick in the midst of drug-induced audio interviews, make the film&#x27;s candid depiction of excess and celebrity especially haunting. The film is dedicated to the memory of Sedgwick and ends with the headlines announcing Sedgwick&#x27;s (not Susan Superstar&#x27;s) death, thus inseparably associating the fictional and the genuine figure.

== Production ==

Warhol superstar Susan Bottomly who had starred in &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; (1966) was originally intended to star in the film. David Weisman, who co-wrote and co-directed the film recalled:Edie Sedgwick was never intended to be the lead in this film ... It was going to be a beautiful young lady who had just appeared at the Factory by the name of Susan Bottomly [International Velvet] and she was just this startling young ingenue whose father was the District Attorney of Boston and had convicted the Boston Strangler... we had to.. get releases from everybody and so Susan Bottomly was 17 and we needed her father&#x27;s permission so at the last minute he refused and she was out but in the script her name, the character name, was Susan.Production of &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; began on March 26, 1967 as a project of Factory regulars John Palmer, David Weisman, Genevieve Charbin, Chuck Wein, Bob Margouleff, Gino Piserchio, with supplemental roles and tasks fulfilled by various other hangers-on. The film originally followed the excessively hip lives of Midtown scenesters Sedgwick and fellow Warhol Superstar Paul America as they lived life in the fast lane (literally speeding down the West Side Highway on massive amounts of amphetamine).

The project was riddled with budget problems and an unfinished, nonsensical script of debauchery, drug use and paranoia. Unreliable actors and rampant drug abuse behind the camera pushed shooting out of control as both Sedgwick and America went missing, putting production on hold. With barely any direction and no end in sight, the film&#x27;s backers, Bob Margouleff&#x27;s parents, lost faith in their son&#x27;s project, and Palmer and Weisman were left with the fragments of an unpresentable film. To salvage these fragments, Palmer and Weisman decided to reshape the script to include the previously shot footage as flashback sequences to tell Sedgwick&#x27;s tragic story through the persona of Susan Superstar.

In the Fall of 1970, they resumed filming on the &quot;Lucky&quot; Baldwin estate in Arcadia, California. For a month, they shot Susan recounting her past through the dazed euphoria of perpetual substance abuse. In 1971, the film went into post-production and later that year Sedgwick died from acute barbiturate intoxication.

&quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; was completed on May 25, 1972, and had its premiere in Amsterdam in July 1972 to critical acclaim, due in part to Sedgwick&#x27;s onscreen presence and representation of a culture that she helped to define. The successful screenings continued in London, Germany, France, San Diego, Denver, and Tempe, Arizona, but then the film disappeared for nearly a decade until interest in Edie Sedgwick was sparked again by the best-selling book &quot;Edie: An American Biography&quot; by George Plimpton and Jean Stein in 1982.

==DVD release on 30th anniversary ==
In the years since its original release, &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; has become a cult classic, due in large part to the film being Edie Sedgwick&#x27;s last starring vehicle. On July 19, 2002, exactly 30 years after its world premiere in Amsterdam, &quot;Ciao!&quot; opened at New York&#x27;s Cinema Village. In October 2002, Plexifilm released a special edition DVD with additional 35mm outtake footage, rare pictures and interviews with the cast and crew of the film.

==Soundtrack==
On April 22, 2017, Light in the Attic Records released the film&#x27;s official soundtrack on their Cinewax imprint, for the occasion of Record Store Day. The first vinyl pressing was limited to 3,000 copies, and it contains the prominent songs featured in the film (by Richie Havens, John Phillips, Kim Milford, and the duo of Skip Battin and Kim Fowley), in addition to most of the incidental electronic music performed by Gino Piserchio. Before this release, the film&#x27;s soundtrack never had been released in any form. A CD version of the soundtrack is also available.

<text>The mass media in Japan include numerous television and radio networks as well as newspapers and magazines in Japan. For the most part, television networks were established based on capital investments by existing radio networks. Variety shows, serial dramas, and news constitute a large percentage of Japanese evening shows.

Western movies are also shown, many with a subchannel for English. There are all-English television channels on cable and satellite (with Japanese subtitles).

==Television networks==

There are 6 nationwide television networks, as follows:
* NHK is a public service broadcaster. The company is financed through &quot;viewer fees,&quot; similar to the licence fee system used in the UK to fund the BBC. NHK deliberately maintains neutral reporting as a public broadcast station, even refusing to mention commodity brand names. NHK has 2 terrestrial TV channels, unlike the other TV networks (in the Tokyo region—channel 1 (NHK General TV) and channel 3 (NHK Educational TV)).
* Nippon Television Network System (NNS)/Nippon News Network (NNN) headed by Nippon Television (NTV). In the Tokyo region, channel 4. Affiliated with the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; newspaper.
* The Tokyo Broadcasting System holding company owns the Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) station (which is broadcast nationally) and the Japan News Network (JNN) which supplies news programming to TBS and other affiliates. In the Tokyo region, channel 6. Affiliated with the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; newspaper. Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting Co., Ltd., a quasi-key station in Nagoya, is related to the &quot;Chunichi Shimbun&quot; newspaper.
* Fuji Network System (FNS) and the Fuji News Network (FNN) share the flagship station Fuji Television. In the Tokyo region, channel 8. Part of the Fujisankei Communications Group, a keiretsu. Tokai TV, a quasi-key station in Nagoya, is related to the &quot;Chunichi Shimbun&quot; newspaper.
* TV Asahi Network/All-Nippon News Network (ANN) headed by TV Asahi. Affiliated with the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; newspaper, which owns Nearly 25% of the station. In the Tokyo region, channel 5.
* TV Tokyo Network (TXN) headed by TV Tokyo. Owned by Nikkei, Inc. In the Tokyo region, channel 7.

In addition, there is the Japanese Association of Independent Television Stations (JAITS), which consists of independent stations in the three major metropolitan areas (excluding Ibaraki, Shizuoka, and Osaka), and includes TV stations affiliated with the &quot;Chunichi Shimbun&quot; newspaper such as Tokyo MX and TV Kanagawa.

Other niches include papers devoted entirely to predicting the results of horse races. One of the best-known papers in the genre is Keiba Book (). Shūkan Go () is a weekly newspaper that covers the results of professional Go tournaments and contains hints on Go strategy.

As in other countries, surveys tend to show that the number of newspaper subscribers is declining, a trend which is expected to continue.

===Claims of media bias===
Claims of media bias in Japanese newspapers and the mainstream media in general are often seen on blogs and right-leaning Internet forums, where the &quot;mass media&quot; (&quot;masu-komi&quot; (abbreviation of mass communication) in Japanese) are often referred to as &quot;mass garbage&quot; (&quot;masu-gomi&quot;). S igns with this epithet were carried by demonstrators in Tokyo on 24 October 2010, at what was reportedly the first demonstration in Japan to be organized on Twitter. Among the general public, the credibility of the press suffered after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant crisis, when reporters failed to press government and industry sources for more information, and official reports turned out to be inaccurate or simply wrong. Kazuo Hizumi, a journalist turned lawyer, details structural problems in his book, 「マスコミはなぜマスゴミと呼ばれるのか？」, &quot;Masukomi wa naze masugomi to yobareru no ka?&quot;, (&quot;Why is mass media called mass garbage?&quot;), which argues that a complex network of institutions, such as elite bureaucrats, judiciary, education system, law enforcement, and large corporations, all of whom stand to gain from maintaining the status quo, shapes the mass media and communication in a way that controls Japanese politics and discourages critical thinking.

==Key stations: television and radio==

In Japan, there are five broadcasting stations which take the lead in the network of commercial broadcasting. The five stations are Nippon Television, Tokyo Broadcasting System, Fuji Television, TV Asahi, and TV Tokyo. Their head offices are in Tokyo, and they are called zaikyō kī kyoku (, Key stations in Tokyo) or kī kyoku (, Key stations).

The key stations make news shows and entertainment programs, and wholesale them to local broadcasting stations through the networks. Although local broadcasting stations also manufacture programs, the usage of the key stations is very large, and 55.7% of the TV program total sales in the 2002 fiscal year (April 2002 to March 2003) were sold by the key stations. Furthermore, the networks are strongly connected with newspaper publishing companies, and they influence the media very strongly. For this reason, they are often criticized.

In addition, there is CS broadcasting and Internet distribution by the subsidiaries of the key stations. The definition of key station has changed a little in recent years.

===Outline===
In Japan, every broadcasting company (except NHK and Radio Nikkei) which performs terrestrial television broadcasts has an appointed broadcast region. In Article 2 of the Japanese Broadcasting Law (放送法), the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications defines the fixed zone where the broadcast of the same program for every classification of broadcast is simultaneously receivable. So, the broadcasting company constructs a network with other regions, and with this network establishes the exchange of news or programs. The broadcasting companies which send out many programs to these networks are called key stations.

Presently the broadcasting stations located in Tokyo send out the programs for the whole country. However, although Tokyo MX is in the Tokyo region, it is only a Tokyo region UHF independent station.

Broadcasting stations in Nagoya and other areas are older than those in Tokyo. However, in order to meet the large costs of making programs key stations were established in Tokyo to sell programs nationwide. Some local stations have a higher profit ratio since they can merely buy programs from the networks.

====Sub-key stations====
Since the broadcasting stations which assign the head offices in Kansai region (especially in Osaka) have a program supply frame at prime time etc. and sent out many programs subsequently to kī kyoku, they are called jun kī kyoku (,sub-key stations).

===List of key stations===
== Advertising agencies ==
# Dentsu (電通). The largest advertising agency in Japan, and the fourth-largest worldwide. Dentsu has an enormous presence in television and other media, and has strong ties to the legislative branch of government.
# Hakuhodo (博報堂). The second-largest Japanese advertising agency. Advertisement agencies under its umbrella include Daiko (大広) and Yomiko Advertising (読売広告社, Yomiuri Kōkokusha). Also known as Showgate, the film production division.
# CyberAgent (サイバーエージェント, Saibā Ējento) The third-largest Japanese advertising agency, that is mainly Internet advertising.
# Asatsu-DK (アサツー ディ・ケイ). The fourth-largest Japanese advertising agency. a subsidiary of Bain Capital, LP.

<text>The pearl danio (Danio albolineatus) is a tropical, freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the family Danioinidae. Originating in Sumatra, Myanmar, and Thailand and Vietnam (Phu Quoc Island),this fish is sometimes found in aquariums by fish-keeping hobbyists. It grows to a maximum length of and lives for around five years. The fish could have a brownish-yellow, pink, or a silver body and two light yellow/white or blue/red stripes. It has an iridescent look. The female fish has two pairs of barbels.

In the wild, the pearl danio is found in along the surface of small, clear rivers and hill streams. They live in a tropical climate with water with a 6.0 – 8.0 pH, a water hardness of up to 5 – 19 dGH, and a temperature range of . Their diet consists mostly of exogenous insects and zooplankton. The pearl danio is an egglayer. Golden varieties are often seen in shops; these are in reality semi-albino fish. The [[blue-redstripe danio]] (&quot;D. pulcher&quot;) and the [[Kedah danio]] (&quot;D. tweediei&quot;) were considered synonymous with this species, but &quot;Eschmeyer&#x27;s Catalog of Fishes&quot; recognises them as valid, distinct species.

<text>In metaphysics, conceptualism is a theory that explains universality of particulars as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind. Intermediate between nominalism and realism, the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of universals from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind&#x27;s perception of them. Conceptualism is anti-realist about abstract objects, just like immanent realism is (their difference being that immanent realism accepts there are mind-independent facts about whether universals are instantiated).

== History ==
=== Medieval philosophy ===
The evolution of late scholastic terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective universality was distinctly defined as conceptualism.

Peter Abélard was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Abélard’s view denied the existence of determinate universals within things. William of Ockham was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no &quot;&quot; outside the mind.

In the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the Jesuits: Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza, Rodrigo de Arriaga and Francisco Oviedo are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of Francisco Suárez, the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the early modern philosophy.

=== Modern philosophy ===
Conceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the early modern thinkers, including René Descartes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, George Berkeley, and David Hume – often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.

Sometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of Immanuel Kant, who holds that universals have no connection with things as they are in themselves because they (universals) are exclusively produced by our &quot;a priori&quot; mental structures and functions, even though the &quot;categories&quot; have an objective validity for objects of experience (that is, phenomena).

In late modern philosophy, conceptualist views were held by G. W. F. Hegel.

=== Contemporary philosophy ===
In contemporary times, Edmund Husserl&#x27;s philosophy of mathematics has been construed as a form of conceptualism. 

Conceptualist realism (a view put forward by David Wiggins in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.

Though separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of &quot;Mind and World&quot; by John McDowell in 1994. McDowell&#x27;s touchstone is the famous refutation that Wilfrid Sellars provided for what he called the &quot;Myth of the Given&quot;—the notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or &#x27;given&#x27; items, such as sense data. Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for perceptual conceptualism, according to which perceptual content is conceptual &quot;from the ground up&quot;, that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell&#x27;s philosophy of justification is considered a form of foundationalism: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.

A clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:

I have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world’s impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject’s rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.

McDowell&#x27;s conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism&#x27;s genesis, shares the view that universals are not &quot;given&quot; in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.

The retroactive application of the term &quot;perceptual conceptualism&quot; to Kant&#x27;s philosophy of perception is debatable. Robert Hanna has argued for a rival interpretation of Kant&#x27;s work termed perceptual non-conceptualism.

<doc id="633043" wikidata="Q606149" url="?curid=633043" title="Antonio di Benedetto">
<text>Antonio di Benedetto (2 November 1922 – 10 October 1986) was an Argentine novelist, short story writer and journalist.

==Career==
Di Benedetto began writing and publishing stories in his adolescence, inspired by the works of Fyodor Dostoevsky and Luigi Pirandello. &quot;Mundo Animal&quot;, appearing in 1953, was his first story collection and won prestigious awards. A revised version came out in 1971, but the Xenos Books translation uses the first edition to catch the youthful flavor.

Antonio di Benedetto wrote five novels. &quot;Zama&quot; (1956) is considered by critics to be his magnum opus. &quot;El silenciero&quot; (1964, &quot;The Silentiary&quot;) is noteworthy for expressing his intense abhorrence of noise, and was followed by &quot;Las suicidas&quot; (1969, &quot;The Suicides&quot;). These three novels have come to be known as the &quot;Trilogy of Expectation&quot;. Critics have compared his works to Alain Robbe-Grillet, Julio Cortázar and Ernesto Sábato. 

In 1976, during the military dictatorship of General Videla, di Benedetto was imprisoned and tortured. Released a year later, he went into exile in Spain, then returned home in 1984. He travelled widely and won numerous awards, but never acquired a level of worldwide fame comparable to other Latin American writers, perhaps because his work was not translated to many languages.

<text>The Audi A8 is a full-size luxury sedan manufactured and marketed by the German automaker Audi since 1994. Succeeding the Audi V8, and now in its fourth generation, the A8 has been offered with either front- or permanent all-wheel drive and in short- and long-wheelbase variants. The first two generations employed the Volkswagen Group D platform, with the current generation deriving from the MLB platform. After the original model&#x27;s 1994 release, Audi released the second generation in late 2002, the third in late 2009, and the fourth and current iteration in 2017. Noted as the first mass-market car with an aluminium chassis, all A8 models have used this construction method co-developed with Alcoa and marketed as the Audi Space Frame.

A mechanically upgraded, high-performance version of the A8 debuted in 1996 as the Audi S8. Produced exclusively at Audi&#x27;s Neckarsulm plant, the S8 is fitted standard with Audi&#x27;s quattro all-wheel drive system. The S8 was only offered with a short-wheelbase for the first three generations, being joined by a long-wheelbase variant for the fourth generation.

== D2 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4D; 1994) ==
=== Development ===
In 1982, Ferdinand Piëch signed an agreement with Aluminum Company of America. The objective was to design and develop a car that would be substantially lighter than any other vehicles in its class (to compensate for the fact that standard all-wheel drive was around heavier than competitors&#x27; rear-wheel drive). In the late 1980s, it was decided that the target vehicle would be a successor to the V8 (Typ 4C) flagship introduced in 1988. By 1990, a final design by Chris Bird and Dirk van Braeckel was chosen and frozen for series production in mid-1991. In September 1993, the Audi Space Frame (ASF) Concept was unveiled at the 1993 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) as a D2 Typ 4D prototype in polished aluminum. Pilot production began in December 1993 and development ended in early 1994, at a total cost of $700 million (£418.1 million).

=== Introduction ===
The Audi A8 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4D) was presented in February 1994 and debuted at the 1994 Geneva Auto Show in March, with full-scale factory production commencing in June 1994, although it was not until October 1996, for the 1997 model year that it became available in North America. Unlike its predecessor, the Audi V8 model, which was built on an existing steel platform, the A8 debuted on the then-new Volkswagen Group D2 platform, an all aluminium monocoque, marketed as the (ASF), which helped to reduce weight and preserve structural rigidity. The saloon/sedan was offered in both the A8 (standard wheelbase), and the A8 L extended or long-wheelbase (LWB) version. The A8 L adds of rear legroom. Updates to the car in 1997 included the addition of six interior airbags. The A8 was designed as a competitor to fellow German rivals Mercedes Benz S Class and the BMW 7 Series. It also competed against the British Jaguar XJ and the Japanese Lexus LS.

In 1997, Audi introduced the first series production electronic stability control (ESP) for all-wheel drive vehicles (Audi A8 and Audi A6)– the world&#x27;s first production cars with both front and rear side airbags.

For 1997, the new A8 was available with either front-wheel drive (FWD), or the Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive. The FWD models are powered by a 2.8-litre V6 engine, producing , and a 3.7-litre V8 engine producing , while the quattro received a 4.2-litre V8 producing .

The A8 is available with standard luxury amenities, including dual-zone climate control, wood and leather interior trim, 14-way power and heated seats, and an enhanced Bose audio system.

In 1998, upon assuming office, German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder chose the A8 to be his official state car, marking a break from tradition, as his predecessors had preferred Mercedes-Benz S-Class models. Upon being re-elected to second term in 2002, he moved on to the next generation A8&#x27;s sister model Volkswagen Phaeton.

In 1999, Audi&#x27;s flagship received side curtain airbags, new colours, and restructuring of option packages. The North American &quot;warm weather package&quot; added a solar sunroof which allows the interior ventilation fans to run, keeping the interior cool while the car is parked with the engine turned off. Changes to all models included a larger passenger-side mirror, and a first aid kit located in the rear centre armrest.

In 1999 for the 2000 model year came a minor front-end restyle, with new, larger, clear headlights, a revised grille, and lower front valance with standard projection fog lamps. In the interior, the seats received a new, horizontal stitch pattern. Also, the 3.7-litre V8 FWD model was dropped, leaving the 2.8 V6 model and the long-wheelbase and short-wheelbase 4.2-litre quattro. These restyled cars also featured revised external door handles and an integrated radio antenna. For 2000, the North American A8 line-up was expanded to include the A8 L.

In 2001, Audi introduced its new W12 engine, a compact 6.0-litre unit developed by effectively mating two VR6 engines together at the crankshaft. The engine quickly became available in the A8, though only to European and Asian customers. From its introduction through its discontinuation in 2003, only 750 of the D2 &quot;W12&quot; models were produced. 2001 also marked the debut of the high-performance S8 variant in North American markets. It produced 360 hp.

In 2002, the A8 L received standard xenon high-intensity discharge lamp (HID) headlights, and a heated steering wheel. A tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS), an updated Symphony II stereo, and new exterior colours were also added. For 2002, all A8 variants received a trunk/boot interior release lever to facilitate escape in the event an individual became trapped within.

Factory production of this generation ceased at Number 105,092 on 4 August 2002.

=== Coupé (prototype) ===
In 1997, IVM Automotive of Munich, Germany built a two-door Audi A8 Coupé. The car was unveiled at the 1997 Geneva Motor Show. Audi contracted IVM to build the prototype, and was considering production of the vehicle. The coupé had a re-engineered aluminium body, shorter than the production A8 saloon. Like the Mercedes-Benz CL-Class, there was no central &quot;B&quot; pillar, giving the car a seamless design with a gradually sloping roofline. The car included custom leather seats which could seat four. Ultimately, Audi decided not to put the A8 Coupé into production, citing lower-than-expected sales figures for the similar BMW 8 Series (E31) and Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupé. Only one A8 Coupé was ever built. The single prototype, painted in a colour called &quot;Ming Blue pearl&quot;, remains the property of IVM Automotive, and resides in Munich. Its last public appearance was in 2002 on a series of test drives.

=== S8 ===

Audi introduced the S8 4.2 quattro into the European market in 1996. The S8 followed the naming convention of other high-performance Audi &quot;S&quot; models such as the Audi A6-derived S6 and was similar in vein of Mercedes-Benz AMG models. In some markets such as the UK, the S8 was only available with the automatic transmission. Cosmetically, Audi differentiated the S8 from the A8 with solid aluminium alloy door mirror housings, chrome-effect beltline and lower front grille trim, and polished twin exhaust pipes, along with subtle &quot;S8&quot; badging. 14-way power adjustable and heated sports front seats with memory function were fitted as were heated rear seats. Standard alloy wheels were 18-inch cast aluminium alloy &quot;Avus&quot; six-spoke style. After the 1999 facelift, 20-inch polished nine-spoke RS wheels became an option. In 2002, 18-inch nine-spoke RS wheels became a no-cost option.

At the same time of the A8&#x27;s facelift in late 1999, the S8 received the same cosmetic upgrades. This update marked the release of the S8 to the North American market. Production of the D2 series S8 ended in September 2002.

The D2 series S8 featured an uprated, version of the 4.2-litre V8 with four valves per cylinder. From late 1999, Audi increased this to five valves per cylinder with power increased to and . From launch in 1996, European-market models came standard with a six-speed manual transmission. A sports-recalibrated version of the ZF &quot;5HP24&quot; five-speed tiptronic automatic, featuring &quot;Dynamic Shift Programme&quot; (DSP) was released a year later and was the only transmission available in most other markets.

A retuned, lowered sports suspension included a 30 percent stiffer spring rate and 40 percent more compression damping in the shock absorbers. Speed-sensitive &quot;servotronic&quot; power assisted steering was also standard.

The brakes featured Bosch 5.3 anti-lock braking system (ABS), with electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), and worked radially ventilated front discs. From 2002, an upgraded Bosch 5.7 electronic stability programme became standard fitment.

== D3 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4E; 2002) ==
The second-generation Audi A8 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4E) built on the Volkswagen Group D3 platform was unveiled via press release in July 2002 and introduced in November 2002 in Europe and in June 2003 (as a 2004 model) in the United States. The model was longer than the previous generation, with room for four or five large adult occupants in the cabin, depending on rear seat configuration. The D3 development program began in 1996, with the design process commencing in Ingolstadt in 1997. The whole Audi design studio based in Ingolstadt first contributed sketch proposals, from which numerous different themes emerged. Six of them were developed into full-size clay models and worked up in a traditional manner adjacent to full-size tape drawings. At least three one-quarter scale models were produced to explore other design variations.

The six full-size exterior clay models were reduced to two in late 1998 and these continued to be refined in parallel for a year. At the end of 1999, the final theme selection was made by Miklós Kovács and Imre Hasanic, the main contributing designers. This lengthy development time was in part due to the body being made from aluminium, a material less able to take the small radii of sharp feature lines such as those on the (steel bodied) A4 (B6) designed in 1998.

In parallel to the exterior design development, the interior design was progressed with a total of four full-size models produced, and the production car&#x27;s horizontally-themed instrument panel design dominant from early on, with Norbert Schneider, Mark Bergold and Enzo Rothfuss the main contributing designers.

Grouping major controls nearer to the driver for a more driver focused identity whilst creating a more airy and spacious feel were early priorities for the interior design team, which was headed by Jurgen Albamonte. This was in part facilitated by the Multi Media Interface (MMI) designed by Jurgen Schröder, that pioneered on the D3 A8 after the Audi Avantissimo concept car preview, and also by class leading colour and trim from Barbara Krömeke and Melinda Jenkins.

Under the supervision of Dany Garand, during the first half of 2000 exterior and interior clay models were digitized and developed using digital design tools in a supporting, not leading, capacity. The D3 final production design was later frozen in the summer of 2000 for an August 2002 start of production.

The A8 was previewed at the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show by the Audi Avantissimo concept car. This concept introduced much of the technology later available on the series production A8 D3, including: Multi Media Interface, 6-speed automatic transmission with shift paddles, V8 biturbo engine (RS6), self-levelling adaptive air suspension with continuously controlled damping, electric park brake, bi-xenon headlights with static Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS) curve headlights, dashboard, driver identification systems with fingerprint scanner.

As with the previous version, two body variants of the second generation A8 are offered, the A8 (standard, or short wheelbase), and the long-wheelbase (LWB) A8 L. The A8 L adds to the rear legroom and to the overall height of the car.

For quattro all-wheel drive models, a ZF &quot;6HP26-A61&quot; (lower torque capacity 6HP19 version for 6 cylinder models) six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission with &quot;Dynamic Shift Programme&quot; (DSP) and &quot;sport&quot; mode, with optional steering wheel mounted paddle-shifters, is the only transmission offering. Output is transmitted via Audi&#x27;s quattro generation IV all-wheel drive system using the Torsen T-1 centre differential with a default 50:50 torque split front/rear. If the road conditions change, the purely mechanical Torsen differential responds without any delay; it can divert up to 70 percent of power to the front or rear axles.

=== Innovations ===
* World premiere of Multi Media Interface (MMI) in-car user interface (similar to BMW iDrive)
* Multiplexed high speed MOST Bus optical fiber data networks (interconnecting tens of microprocessors on common databusses), integrated with MMI
* First Audi with Bi-Xenon HID headlamps for both low and high beam
* World premiere of static Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS) curve headlights (from Hella)
* First Audi with 4-wheel Adaptive Air Suspension and Continuous Damping Control (CDC)-(Skyhook suspension).
* First Audi GPS navigation system with DVD maps
* First Audi with six-speed automatic transmission (Tiptronic)
* First Audi featuring driver identification system

In 2005, new internal combustion engines became available. In very limited numbers the A8R was produced for 2005. Using the 3.7 Quad cam V8, 6HP transmission. Although similar to the standard A8 it had an upgraded alloy trim vent package, Wood steering wheel and wood grain Transmission selector, other mechanical differences are not disclosed. The A8R was produced to commemorate Audi&#x27;s past Le Mans success. For European and Asian market customers, the entry-level 3.0-litre V6 engine was replaced with a new 3.1-litre unit (badged as &quot;3.2&quot;) featuring Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), which it shared with the Audi B7 A4 and Audi C6 A6. The top-of-the-line W12 version debuted that year. The advantage of the W12 engine layout is its compact packaging, allowing Audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive, whereas a conventional V12 could only have a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels. In fact, Audi&#x27;s 6.0-litre W12 is slightly smaller (by overall dimensions) than the 4.2-litre V8. This model was also the first to be offered with LED running lights.

In addition to the added powertrains, Audi restyled the D3 platform A8 range slightly in 2005, giving all variants a taller, wider trapezoidal &quot;single-frame&quot; grille. The top-of-the-line W12 engined W12 version was the first model to be equipped with this grille; V8 engined models were fitted with the new grille the following year. The W12 variant was known for its appearance as the hero car in &quot;Transporter 2&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;Transporter 3&quot;.

The D3 generation A8 introduced the 4.1-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) V8 engine (subsequently uprated to ). It is badged as the &quot;4.2 TDI&quot; and is based on the &quot;4.0 TDI&quot; badged 3.9L turbodiesel engine. It uses two turbochargers and two intercoolers, with each turbocharger functioning exclusively for one bank of four cylinders.

The adaptive air suspension gives the vehicle clearance a range from its normal 120 mm up to 145 mm in lift mode and down to 95 mm in the &quot;Autobahn&quot; mode, which is automatically activated when a speed of more than is maintained for more than 30 seconds.

In September 2005 Audi became the first car maker to offer the 1,000-watt 14-channel ICEpower sound system option from Bang &amp; Olufsen.

=== 2007 facelift ===
Changes include:
* Updated front fascia incorporating Audi&#x27;s signature single frame full-nose grill. Complementing the pronounced styling of the nose, designers tossed the understated round fog lights, opting for larger rectangular fog light housings- inside a set of &#x27;Side-View illuminators&#x27; have been integrated into the housing; aiding drivers in low-light or poor visibility conditions by automatically illuminating depending on speed and steering angle. Side-View Illuminators operate independent of fog lights. 
* Updated tail-light assembly featuring much brighter and more efficient LED bulbs. Dual rear fog lights are still standard.
New Optional Features:
* Full speed range adaptive cruise control ACC Plus, can now brake until stop
* Braking guard radar-guided forward collision warning system
* &quot;Side Assist&quot; detects cars in the A8&#x27;s blind spots
* Lane assist helps when the driver attempts to change lanes without signalling first.

=== A8 L W12 quattro Security ===

The A8 L W12 quattro Security is an armoured vehicle with B6+ and B7 (European standard) ballistic ratings. It includes a W12 engine rated at and of torque, emergency exit system featuring pyrotechnic blown-out doors, fire extinguisher system with spray jets located in the engine compartment, underbody and in the wheel arches; smoke extractor in passenger compartment, run flat tires, bullet proof windows, the full protection plus package and LED flashers in the exterior mirrors. Buyers are also offered facility to dispatch two drivers on a special training course.

The A8L W12 was featured as the protagonist&#x27;s car in the &quot;Transporter&quot; film series.

=== S8 5.2 FSI quattro === 
The S8 high-performance sports variant, now called the &quot;Audi S8 5.2 FSI quattro&quot;, was announced in the last quarter of 2005 and full production started in June 2006 and ended in September 2009.

The S8 includes subtle detailing to distinguish it from its related A8. The trapezoidal &quot;single-frame&quot; grille bears the characteristic Audi &quot;S model&quot; vertical strut detail which is highlighted in a chrome finish. &quot;S8&quot; badging is displayed front and rear, whilst &quot;V10&quot; badges are displayed on each front wing above the side-repeater indicators. The rear boot-lid incorporates a subtle rear spoiler, and the rear is finished with four chromed oval exhaust tailpipes. Adaptive Xenon-plus high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamps include static turning lights, along with &quot;swiveling&quot; dynamic cornering lights. Daytime running lamps are five light-emitting diodes (LEDs) incorporated into a cloverleaf designed reflector, incorporated into the main headlamp housing.

The D3 series S8 features a 5.2-litre all-aluminium alloy four-valves per cylinder V10 petrol engine. This engine, a first for Audi, is often incorrectly referred to as a derivative of the Lamborghini 5-litre V10 engine fitted to the first-generation Gallardo. The 5.2-litre V10 in the S8 is based on Audi&#x27;s 4.2-litre V8 FSI. Lamborghini replaced its own 5-litre engine with the 5.2-litre engine from Audi R8 for the second generation Gallardo and its successor, Huracán.

A sports-optimised ZF &quot;6HP26-A61&quot; six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission with &quot;Dynamic Shift Programme&quot; (DSP) and &quot;sport&quot; mode, with steering wheel mounted paddle-shifters, is the only offering. Output is transmitted via Audi&#x27;s quattro generation IV all-wheel drive system, initially using the Torsen T-1 50:50 dynamic centre differential, and from 2007 for the 2008 model year, utilising the Torsen T-3 asymmetric dynamic centre differential, with a &quot;default&quot; torque distribution of 40 percent to the front axle and 60 percent to the rear. If the road conditions change, the purely mechanical differential responds without any delay; it can divert up to 85 percent of power to the rear wheels, and as much as 65 percent to the front wheels.

The S8&#x27;s top speed is electronically limited to . Audi&#x27;s factory performance claims indicate a time of 5.1 seconds whilst consuming 98 RON unleaded petrol. The S8 has similar performance to Audi&#x27;s own top-of-the-line A8 L W12, though the W12 is more expensive, has more torque, and built on a longer wheelbase. Compared to the A8 L W12, the S8 has sportier mechanical features such as a firmer suspension, larger wheels, and ceramic brakes. The shorter wheelbase and 10-cylinder engine save weight for better handling, but at 5.4 seconds from 0– the S8 trails the W12.

The S8, like its related A8, utilises a multi-link suspension layout front and rear, with pressurised air springs. However, for the S8, the effective spring and damper rates are noticeably firmer, along with re-engineered suspension mounts.

The brake system consists of radially ventilated discs all round. The discs are clamped with gloss-black painted dual-piston calipers up front, and a single-piston sliding caliper at the rear, coupled to an electro-mechanical parking brake. A Bosch ESP 5.7 (later upgraded to ESP 8.0) electronic stability control, with ABS, brake assist, and EBD complete the brake system. Optional &quot;Audi ceramic&quot; carbon fibre-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite front and rear brakes are available, which use radially vented, and floating SGL Carbon discs, with anthracite grey painted twelve-piston fixed Brembo monobloc alloy calipers. Standard alloy wheels consist of 20-inch &quot;S design&quot; alloy wheels.

=== A8L Centennial Limited Edition (2009) ===
The A8L Centennial Limited Edition (奧迪A8L百年限量版) is a limited (800 units total) version of the A8L 3.0 FSI with multitronic and the A8L 6.0 W12 quattro for the Chinese market, commemorating Audi&#x27;s 100th anniversary. It includes a horizontal chrome-plated front grille (from the A8L 6.0 W12 quattro), &quot;V6&quot; metal logo at the upper left of the air-inlet grille (A8L 3.0 FSI), LED daytime running lights, 19-inch 12-spoke polished aluminium alloy wheels, heated steering wheel in grey leather with beige stitching, Bang &amp; Olufsen advanced audio system, Alcantara equipment bag, Assam ash red veneer, floor mat with aluminium trim and a metal &#x27;Audi exclusive&#x27; commemorative logo at inner door trims.

A 3.0-litre V6 TDI with either or will be available later. A 6.3-litre W12 engine only for the long wheelbase model was made available in 2010, and compared to its predecessor it has a larger displacement and direct fuel injection. All engines are mated to the new eight-speed ZF 8HP automatic transmission. Although other Audi vehicles such as the 2010 Audi S4 and 2011 Audi A7 had switched from the 4.2 L V8 to the 3.0 L supercharged V6, the Audi A8 retained a higher-output 4.2 L V8 as the base engine for the 2011 and 2012 model years in North America.

Taiwan models went on sale on 11 November 2010. Early models include 3.0 TFSI quattro (290PS).

In the first phase, the system provides warning of an impending accident, while the hazard warning lights are activated, the side windows and sunroof are closed and the front seat belts are tensioned. In the second phase, the warning is followed by light braking, strong enough to win the driver&#x27;s attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking at a rate of . The fourth phase decelerates the car at followed by automatic deceleration at full braking power, roughly half a second before projected impact. A second system, called (Pre Sense Rear), is designed to reduce the consequences of rear-end collisions. The sunroof and windows are closed and seat belts are prepared for impact. The optional memory seats are moved forward to protect the car&#x27;s occupants. The system uses sensor fusion with twin radar and a mono camera, and was introduced in 2010.

==== S8 4.0 TFSI quattro (2012) ====
The D4 series Audi S8 4.0 TFSI quattro went on sale in 2012. The D4 S8 was based on the A8 platform, considered in America to be the &quot;short wheel base&quot; comparative to the A8L. Like the previous iteration, the D4 S8 costs less than the A8 L W12.

The S8 can accelerate from in 4.2 seconds. It is powered by a 4.0-litre TFSI biturbo V8 engine with . The engine utilises cylinder deactivation so it can run as a V4 for better fuel economy. The S8&#x27;s engine is shared with the Bentley Continental GT, while a detuned variant of the engine makes which is found in the 2013 Audi S6, Audi S7, and Audi A8. Direct competitors include the BMW Alpina B7 and Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG, which also have biturbo V8 engines.

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Auto Show, and went on sale in spring 2012.

Taiwan models went on sale in 2013.

The S8 was discontinued in the United States of America, to be replaced by the S8 Plus for the latest iteration of this generation before the facelift in 2018. In other parts of the world customers had the choice between the two variants.

=====S8 Plus 4.0 TFSI Quattro (2016)=====
Based on the same chassis and underpinnings as the D4 S8, the D4 S8 Plus became the sole option for ordering the S8-variant of the Audi A8 line in the US, in the 2016 and 2017 model years. The S8 Plus was dialed up to out of the same powerplant as the previous S8, by remapping the turbo boost and fuel delivery of the engine. Additionally, the Carbon Ceramic braking system is standard on the S8 Plus in some markets. The vast majority of options on the S8 Plus were identical to the previous S8; however, it had darkened tail lights standard, and the option for adding carbon fiber styling elements such as the mirror caps, rear lip spoiler, rear diffuser, and front lip. Different markets had different standard packages combining elements of the external carbon package, the dynamic package and the interior design package. A highly-optioned build of the S8 Plus would outprice the nominally higher-end A8 L W12 whose production ceased after the 2018 model year. Unlike the regular S8 which was built by Audi on the regular assembly line alongside other A8 variants, the S8 Plus was built by Audi Sport (formerly Quattro GmbH) and has a VIN that starts with WUA to identify it.

==== A8, S8, A8 Audi exclusive concept, A8 hybrid (2013) ====
Changes include:
* First worldwide series production car with digitally controlled, full-LED glare-free adaptive highbeam: Matrix LED. The high-beam comprises 25 individual light-emitting diodes per unit that can be switched on and off or dimmed individually depending on the situation. This enables the headlight system to react extremely precisely to other vehicles while always brightly illuminating the road. Additional features of the new headlights are the intelligent cornering light, new-look daytime running lights and dynamic turn signals. The lighting system in the A8 uses predictive route data from the navigation system to adjust the distribution of light in response to the current driving situation. In combination with the optional Navigation plus with MMI touch, the system recognizes route data contained in the navigation system, such as curves and road classifications.
* Cornering light: Using predictive route data supplied by the MMI navigation plus, the focus of the Matrix LED beam is shifted towards the bend even before the driver turns the steering wheel.
* Night Vision Assistant can now recognize larger animals in addition to pedestrians. Pedestrian Marker Lights work together with the optional night vision assistant. As soon as a pedestrian is detected in a critical range in front of the vehicle, individual LEDs flash briefly three times in succession to alert that person, who is then clearly visible to the driver.
* Head-up display
* Standard electromechanical power steering (optional dynamic steering varies its ratio with the car&#x27;s speed)

====Production====

====Marketing====
As an April Fools&#x27; Day joke on 1 April 2015, Audi Japan announced a special edition A8 5.5 with a rice cooker on the rear center console. The 5.5 designation is a play on the Japanese words &quot;go&quot; (five) and &quot;han&quot; (half); when combined, they become , which is the Japanese word for &quot;rice&quot;. Audi S8 was used in &quot;The Transporter Refueled&quot;. Audi S8 was used in &quot;&quot;, alongside &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;. A blockbuster style commercial film &quot;Suspect&quot; was published for the Audi S8 in 2012, which features an unnamed male model as driver.

== D5 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4N, 2017) ==
===A8 and A8 L===
The design of the A8 and A8 L was based on the Audi Prologue concept. The new generation, code-named D5, was unveiled at the Audi Summit in Barcelona on 11 July 2017 and presented at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. The standard wheelbase A8 went on sale in November 2017, and the long wheelbase A8 L was launched in 2018.

Traffic Jam Pilot is the new feature, consisting of Level 3 autonomous driving, that allows the car to travel in the heavy traffic on the highway up to 60 km/h without any assistance from the driver. Due to the complicated legal regulations, Audi cancelled the launch of this feature for the United States market in 2019.

As part of the deal between Marvel Studios and Audi, the fourth generation of A8 first premiered in the &quot;Driver&#x27;s Test&quot; commercial that premiered on 19 June 2017, as a tie-in to &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; movie. In the commercial, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes the car, a prototype belonging to Tony Stark, for a test-drive alongside his driving instructor played by J. B. Smoove. The car also had a small product placement appearance in the actual movie itself.

===S8 (2020)===

The higher performance version, S8, was introduced in the late 2019 for 2020 model year. Unlike the previous generation S8s which were only built upon the short-wheelbase A8 variant, the D5 generation will be available in both short-wheelbase and long-wheelbase, with North America having only the long-wheelbase S8 (i.e. S8 L). The S8 has higher output of petrol V8 as fitted to A8 and A8L 60 TFSI quattro.

=== 2022 model year facelift ===


On 29 October 2021, Audi revealed the facelifted A8 ahead of its Chinese introduction at the Guangzhou Auto Show and later next year in Europe. The facelift also included the revival of the Horch (A8L Horch Founder Edition) brand to compete against other ultra-luxury sedans in China with Europe also a possibility. A facelift Horch was presented in February 2024. Unlike previous generations, the D5 will last longer and not end at least until 2026.

===Engines and Transmission===
At the launch, A8 had two engine options: one 3-litre petrol V6 (55 TFSI quattro) and 3-litre diesel V6 (50 TDI quattro). For 2019, the engine range was expanded to include the petrol and diesel V8 engines (60 TFSI quattro in 2020 and 60 TDI quattro in 2019, respectively). The plug-in hybrid version (PHEV) with a 3-litre petrol V6 and electric motor (60 TFSI e quattro) was launched in 2019. No hybrid system is fitted to the diesel engines. The petrol V8 engines fitted to the 60 TFSI quattro and S8 TFSI quattro have 48-volt MHEV systems that use the electric motor as a starter and for power assistance. No W12 engine has been announced yet as of January 2021.

All A8, A8 L, and the S8 feature the quattro all-wheel-drive system and an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission.

<text>Inglourious Basterds is a 2009 war film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl, Til Schweiger and Mélanie Laurent. The film tells an alternate history story of two converging plots to assassinate Nazi Germany&#x27;s leadership at a Paris cinema—one through a British operation largely carried out by a team of Jewish American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt), and another by French Jewish cinema proprietor Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent) who seeks to avenge her murdered family. Both are faced against Hans Landa (Waltz), an SS colonel with a fearsome reputation for hunting Jews.

The title (but not the story) was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari&#x27;s 1978 Euro War film &quot;The Inglorious Bastards&quot;, but deliberately misspelled as &quot;a Basquiat-esque touch&quot;. Tarantino wrote the script in 1998, but struggled with the ending and chose instead to direct the two-part film &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. After directing &quot;Death Proof&quot; in 2007, Tarantino returned to work on &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. A co-production of the United States and Germany, the film began principal photography in October 2008 and was filmed in Germany and France with a $70 million production budget. It premiered on May 20, 2009, at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival, and received a wide release in theaters in the United States and Europe in August 2009 by the Weinstein Company and Universal Pictures.

&quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; grossed $321 million worldwide, making it Tarantino&#x27;s highest-grossing film to that point, until it was surpassed by &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012). The film received critical acclaim, with Waltz&#x27;s performance as Hans Landa being singled out for praise, but some criticized the historical liberties taken. It also won multiple awards and nominations, among them eight Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay). For his role as Landa, Waltz won the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Best Actor Award, as well as the BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, Critics&#x27; Choice, Golden Globe, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Plot==
In 1941, Austrian SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite about a fugitive Jewish family, the Dreyfuses. Landa boasts about his nickname, &quot;The Jew Hunter,&quot; then urges LaPadite to give up the Dreyfuses for the safety of his own family. After LaPadite tearfully admits that they are hiding under his floorboards, Landa directs his men to massacre them. One of them, young Shosanna, escapes unharmed.

Three years later, U.S. Army Lieutenant Aldo Raine recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the &quot;Basterds,&quot; a black ops commando unit tasked with instilling fear among Nazis in occupied France by killing and scalping them. The group includes Sergeant Donny &quot;The Bear Jew&quot; Donowitz, Privates First Class Smithson Utivich and Omar Ulmer, rogue German Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, and Austrian-born translator Corporal Wilhelm Wicki. In Germany, Adolf Hitler interviews a German soldier, who reveals that Raine carved a swastika into his forehead after massacring his squad. Raine leaves this mark on all surviving German soldiers as a way to make their Nazi affiliations clear even after the war.

In Paris, Shosanna operates a cinema under the name Emmanuelle Mimieux, and meets Fredrick Zoller, a famed German sniper set to star in the German propaganda film &quot;Stolz der Nation&quot; (&quot;Nation&#x27;s Pride&quot;). Infatuated with &quot;Emmanuelle,&quot; Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the film&#x27;s premiere at her cinema. Landa, as the premiere&#x27;s head of security, interrogates Shosanna but does not reveal if he recognizes her. She plots with her Afro-French lover and projectionist, Marcel, to kill the German leaders by burning down the cinema with her collection of highly flammable nitrate films.

British Commando Lieutenant Archie Hicox, a former film critic and fluent German speaker, is recruited for Operation Kino, an attack on the premiere with the Basterds. Disguised as German officers, Hicox, Stiglitz, and Wicki meet with German film star Bridget von Hammersmark, an undercover Allied agent, at a tavern in Nazi-occupied northern France. Hicox&#x27;s unusual accent arouses suspicion from Wehrmacht Sergeant Wilhelm and Major Dieter Hellström, and he blows the group&#x27;s cover with a non-German hand gesture. A gunfight ensues, killing everyone except Wilhelm and a wounded von Hammersmark. Raine arrives and negotiates for von Hammersmark&#x27;s release, giving her a chance to shoot Wilhelm. Raine tortures von Hammersmark, believing she set his men up, but she convinces him of her loyalty to the Allies and reveals that Hitler will be attending the premiere. She proposes that Raine, Donowitz and Ulmer attend the premiere posing as Italian filmmakers, remarking that Germans do not recognize Italian accents. Landa investigates the tavern and finds von Hammersmark&#x27;s shoe and a napkin with her signature.

The Basterds infiltrate the premiere with timed explosives. Landa, who is fluent in Italian, readily sees through their cover and confronts von Hammersmark with her missing shoe before strangling her to death. He has Raine arrested along with Utivich, whom he has also detected, but leaves Ulmer and Donowitz in the theater. Recognizing the opportunity of his situation, Landa offers to let the attack proceed if Raine&#x27;s OSS commanders will guarantee his safety after the war. Raine contacts his commanders and Landa negotiates a generous deal for himself and his radio operator.

During the screening, Zoller slips away to the projection booth and berates Shosanna for rejecting his advances, leading them to shoot each other dead. As &quot;Nation&#x27;s Pride&quot; reaches its climax, Shosanna&#x27;s face appears on the screen telling the Nazi audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Having locked the auditorium, Marcel ignites a pile of nitrate film behind the screen with his cigarette, setting the theater ablaze. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the opera box, gunning down Hitler and Goebbels and firing into the crowd until their explosives kill everyone inside the cinema, including themselves. Donowitz spends his last seconds unloading his submachine gun into Hitler&#x27;s face.

Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender to Raine. Raine casually shoots the radio operator, infuriating Landa for breaking the terms of the deal, but Raine shrugs off his outrage. Utivich and Raine admit that they would make the same deal given the choice, then carve a swastika into Landa&#x27;s forehead that Raine dubs his &quot;masterpiece.&quot;

==Cast==

Director Enzo G. Castellari also makes a cameo appearance in the film at the movie premiere. He previously cameoed as a German in his own &quot;The Inglorious Bastards&quot; and reprised the same role in this film, but under a different rank and SS organization. Bo Svenson, who starred in Castellari&#x27;s &quot;The Inglorious Bastards&quot;, also has a small cameo in the film as a US colonel in the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Pride&quot; movie.

Additionally, Samuel L. Jackson narrates the film, Harvey Keitel voices the Office of Strategic Services Commander, Bela B appears as an usher and Tarantino appears as an American soldier in &quot;Nation&#x27;s Pride&quot; and a scalped German. Two characters, Mrs. Himmelstein and Madame Ada Mimieux, played by Cloris Leachman and Maggie Cheung, respectively, were both cut from the final film due to length.

Quentin Tarantino spent just over a decade creating the film&#x27;s script because, as he told Charlie Rose in an interview, he became &quot;too precious about the page&quot;, meaning the story kept growing and expanding. Tarantino viewed the script as his masterpiece in the making, so felt it had to become the best thing he had ever written. He described an early premise of the film as his &quot;bunch-of-guys-on-a-mission&quot; film, &quot;my &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; or &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; or &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; kind of thing&quot;.

By 2002, Tarantino found &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; to be a bigger film than planned and saw that other directors were working on World War II films. Tarantino had produced three nearly finished scripts, proclaiming that it was &quot;some of the best writing I&#x27;ve ever done. But I couldn&#x27;t come up with an ending.&quot; He moved on to direct the two-part film &quot;Kill Bill&quot; (2003–2004). After the completion of &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, Tarantino went back to his first storyline draft and considered making it a mini-series, but Luc Besson convinced him to finish it as a film. Instead he trimmed the script, using his script for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) as a guide to length. The revised premise focused on a group of soldiers who escape from their executions and embark on a mission to help the Allies. He described the men as &quot;not your normal hero types that are thrown into a big deal in the Second World War&quot;.

Tarantino planned to begin production in 2005. In November 2004, he delayed production and instead took an acting role in Takashi Miike&#x27;s Western film &quot;Sukiyaki Western Django&quot; (2007), and intended to make a kung fu film entirely in Mandarin; this project foundered. He directed &quot;Death Proof&quot; (2007), part of the double feature &quot;Grindhouse&quot;, before returning to work on &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;.

The film&#x27;s title was inspired by the English-language title of director Enzo G. Castellari&#x27;s 1978 war film, &quot;The Inglorious Bastards&quot;.

Tarantino has said that the film&#x27;s opening scene, in which Landa interrogates the French dairy farmer, is his &quot;favorite thing&quot; he&#x27;s &quot;ever written&quot;.

===Casting===

Tarantino originally sought Leonardo DiCaprio to be cast as Hans Landa, before deciding to have the character played by a native German-speaking actor. The role ultimately went to Austrian Christoph Waltz who, according to Tarantino, &quot;gave me my movie&quot; as he feared the part was &quot;unplayable&quot;. Brad Pitt and Tarantino had wanted to work together for a number of years, but they were waiting for the right project. When Tarantino was halfway through the film&#x27;s script, he sensed that Pitt was a strong possibility for the role of Aldo Raine. By the time he had finished writing, Tarantino thought Pitt &quot;would be terrific&quot; and called Pitt&#x27;s agent to ask if he was available.

Tarantino asked Adam Sandler to play the role of Donny Donowitz, but Sandler declined due to schedule conflicts with the film &quot;Funny People&quot; (2009). Eli Roth was cast in the role instead. Roth also directed the film-within-the-film, &quot;Nation&#x27;s Pride&quot;, which used 300 extras. The director also wanted to cast Simon Pegg in the film as Lt. Archie Hicox, but he was forced to drop out due to scheduling difficulties with &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011). Irish-German actor Michael Fassbender began final negotiations to join the cast as Hicox in August 2008, although he originally auditioned for the role of Landa. B. J. Novak was also cast in August 2008 as Private First Class Smithson Utivich, &quot;a New York-born soldier of &#x27;slight build.

Tarantino talked to actress Nastassja Kinski about playing the role of Bridget von Hammersmark and even flew to Germany to meet her, but a deal could not be reached and Tarantino cast Diane Kruger instead. Rod Taylor was effectively retired from acting and no longer had an agent, but came out of retirement when Tarantino offered him the role of Winston Churchill in the film. This would be Taylor&#x27;s last appearance on film before his death on January 7, 2015. In preparation for the role, Taylor watched dozens of DVDs with footage of Churchill in order to get the Prime Minister&#x27;s posture, body language, and voice, including a lisp, correct. Taylor initially recommended British actor Albert Finney for the role during their conversation, but agreed to take the part because of Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;passion&quot;. Mike Myers, a fan of Tarantino, had inquired about being in the film since Myers&#x27; parents had been in the British Armed Forces. In terms of the character&#x27;s dialect, Myers felt that it was a version of Received Pronunciation meeting the officer class, but mostly an attitude of &quot;I&#x27;m fed up with this war and if this dude can end it, great because my country is in ruins.&quot;

Tarantino met Mélanie Laurent in three rounds, reading all the characters on the first round. On the second meeting, he shared the lines with her; the third was a face-to-face dinner. During the dinner, he told Laurent, &quot;Do you know something—there&#x27;s just something I don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s that you&#x27;re famous in your country, and I&#x27;m really wanting to discover somebody.&quot; Laurent replied &quot;No, no, no. ... I&#x27;m not so famous.&quot; After four days, he called to finalize her for the role of Shosanna. Samm Levine was cast as PFC Hirschberg, because, according to Levine, Tarantino was a big fan of &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;, which starred Levine. Filmmaker Tom Tykwer, who translated parts of the film&#x27;s dialogue into German, recommended Daniel Brühl to Tarantino, who recalled that upon seeing the actor&#x27;s performance in &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; (2003), he declared, &quot;That&#x27;s my [Fredrick Zoller] right there. If Daniel&#x27;s mother had never met Daniel&#x27;s father, I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;d ever have the right Zoller&quot;.

Isabelle Huppert was originally cast in the role of Madame Mimieux before being fired due to creative differences. It was also reported that Catherine Deneuve was considered for the role. 
According to French musician and actor Johnny Hallyday, Tarantino had originally written a role for him in the film.

===Filming===
Tarantino teamed with the Weinstein Company to prepare what he planned to be his film for production. In July 2008, Tarantino and executive producers Harvey and Bob Weinstein set up an accelerated production schedule to be completed for release at the Cannes Film Festival in 2009, where the film would compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or.

The Weinstein Company co-financed the film and distributed it in the United States, and signed a deal with Universal Pictures to finance the rest of the film and distribute it internationally. Germany and France were scheduled as filming locations and principal photography started in October 2008 on location in Germany.

Filming was scheduled to begin on October 13, 2008, and shooting started that week. Special effects were handled by KNB EFX Group with Greg Nicotero and much of the film was shot and edited in the Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, Germany, and in Bad Schandau, a small spa town near Germany&#x27;s border with the Czech Republic.

Roth said that they &quot;almost got incinerated&quot;, during the theater fire scene, as they projected the fire would burn at , but it instead burned at . He said the swastika was not supposed to fall either, as it was fastened with steel cables, but the steel softened and snapped.

On January 11, 2013, on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;, Tarantino said that for the scene where Kruger was strangled, he personally strangled the actress, with his own bare hands, in one take, to aid authenticity.

Following the film&#x27;s screening at Cannes, Tarantino stated that he would be re-editing the film in June before its ultimate theatrical release, allowing him time to finish assembling several scenes that were not completed in time for the hurried Cannes première.

===Music===

Tarantino originally wanted Ennio Morricone to compose the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Morricone was unable to, because the film&#x27;s sped-up production schedule conflicted with his scoring of &quot;Baarìa&quot; (2009). However, Tarantino did use eight tracks composed by Morricone in the film, with four of them included on the CD.

The opening theme is taken from the pseudo-folk ballad &quot;The Green Leaves of Summer&quot;, which was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin and Paul Francis Webster for the opening of the 1960 film &quot;The Alamo&quot;. The soundtrack uses a variety of music genres, including Spaghetti Western and R&amp;B. Prominent in the latter part of the film is David Bowie&#x27;s theme from the 1982 film &quot;Cat People&quot;. The soundtrack, the first of Tarantino&#x27;s not to include dialogue excerpts, was released on August 18, 2009.

==Release==

When the script&#x27;s final draft was finished, it was leaked on the Internet and several Tarantino fan sites began posting reviews and excerpts from the script.

The film&#x27;s first full teaser trailer premiered on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; on February 10, 2009, and was shown in US theaters the following week attached to &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. The trailer features excerpts of Lt. Aldo Raine talking to the Basterds, informing them of the plan to ambush and kill, torture, and scalp unwitting German servicemen, intercut with various other scenes from the film. It also features the spaghetti-westernesque terms &quot;Once Upon A Time In Nazi Occupied France&quot;, which was considered for the film&#x27;s title, and &quot;A Basterd&#x27;s Work Is Never Done&quot;, a line not spoken in the final film (the line occurs in the script during the Bear Jew&#x27;s backstory).

The film was released on August 19, 2009, in the United Kingdom and France, two days earlier than the US release date of August 21, 2009. It was released in Germany on August 20, 2009. Some European cinemas, however, showed previews starting on August 15. In Poland, the artwork on all advertisements and on DVD packaging is unchanged, but the title was translated non-literally to (Bastards of War), so that Nazi iconography could stylize the letter &quot;O&quot;. Tarantino did not misspell the title to differentiate his film from the 1978 movie by the same name. He said it instead was a creative decision which he initially refused to explain, simply saying that &quot;Basterds&quot; was spelled as such because &quot;that&#x27;s just the way you say it&quot;.

===Promotion in Germany and Austria===
Universal Pictures adjusted the film&#x27;s publicity materials and website in Germany and Austria to comply with both countries&#x27; penal laws, as the display of Nazi iconography is restricted there: the Hakenkreuz was removed from the typography of the title, and the steel helmet had a bullet hole in place of the Nazi symbol. The site&#x27;s download section was also revised to exclude wallpaper downloads that openly feature the swastika. Though advertising posters and wallpapers may not show Nazi iconography, this restriction does not apply to &quot;works of art&quot;, according to German and Austrian law, so the film itself was not censored in either Germany or Austria.

===Home media===
The film was released on single-disc DVD and a two-disc special-edition DVD and Blu-ray Disc on December 15, 2009, by Universal Studios Home Entertainment in the United States and Australia. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on December 7, 2009, in the United Kingdom. On its first week of release, the film was number two, only behind &quot;The Hangover&quot;, selling an estimated 1,581,220 DVDs, making $28,467,652 in the United States.

The German version is 50 seconds longer than the American version. The scene in the tavern has been extended. Although in other countries, the extended scene was released as a bonus feature, the German theatrical, DVD, and Blu-ray versions are the only ones to include the full scene.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; grossed $120.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $200.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross $321.4 million, against a production budget of $70 million. It became Tarantino&#x27;s highest-grossing film, both in the US and worldwide, until &quot;Django Unchained&quot; in 2012.

Opening in 3,165 screens, the film earned $14.3 million on the opening Friday of its North American release, on the way to an opening-weekend gross of $38 million, giving Tarantino a personal best weekend opening and the number one spot at the box office, ahead of &quot;District 9&quot;. The film fell to number two in its second weekend, behind &quot;The Final Destination&quot;, with earnings of $20 million, for a 10-day total of $73.8 million.

&quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; opened internationally at number one in 22 markets on 2,650 screens, making $27.49 million. First place openings included France, taking in $6.09 million on 500 screens. The United Kingdom was not far behind making $5.92 million (£3.8 m) on 444 screens. Germany took in $4.20 million on 439 screens and Australia with $2.56 million (A$2.8 m) on 266 screens.

===Critical reception===

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 89% of 332 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A classic Tarantino genre-blending thrill ride, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; is violent, unrestrained, and thoroughly entertaining.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a rating on reviews, gives the film a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Critics&#x27; initial reactions at the Cannes Film Festival were mixed. The film received an eight- to eleven-minute standing ovation from critics after its first screening at Cannes, although &quot;Le Monde&quot; dismissed it, saying &quot;Tarantino gets lost in a fictional World War II&quot;. Despite this, Anne Thompson of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film, but opined that it was not a masterpiece, claiming: &quot;&quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; is great fun to watch, but the movie isn&#x27;t entirely engaging ... You don&#x27;t jump into the world of the film in a participatory way; you watch it from a distance, appreciating the references and the masterful mise en scène. This is a film that will benefit from a second viewing&quot;.

Critic James Berardinelli gave the film his first four-star review of 2009, stating, &quot;With &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;, Quentin Tarantino has made his best movie since &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;&quot;, and that it was &quot;one hell of an enjoyable ride&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; also gave the film a four-star review, writing that &quot;Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; is a big, bold, audacious war movie that will annoy some, startle others and demonstrate once again that he&#x27;s the real thing, a director of quixotic delights.&quot;

Author and critic Daniel Mendelsohn was disturbed by the portrayal of Jewish American soldiers mimicking German atrocities done to European Jews, stating, &quot;In &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;, Tarantino indulges this taste for vengeful violence by—well, by turning Jews into Nazis&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated he was &quot;struck ... by how exasperatingly awful and transcendentally disappointing it is&quot;.

While praising Christoph Waltz&#x27;s performance (&quot;a good actor new to American audiences&quot;), David Denby, of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, dismissed the film with the following words: &quot;The film is skillfully made, but it&#x27;s too silly to be enjoyed, even as a joke. ... Tarantino has become an embarrassment: his virtuosity as a maker of images has been overwhelmed by his inanity as an &quot;idiot de la cinémathèque&quot;&quot;. Journalist Christopher Hitchens likened the experience of watching the film to &quot;sitting in the dark having a great pot of warm piss emptied very slowly over your head&quot;.

The film also met some criticism from the Jewish press. In &quot;Tablet&quot;, Liel Liebowitz criticizes the film as lacking moral depth. He argues that the power of film lies in its ability to impart knowledge and subtle understanding, but &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; serves more as an &quot;alternative to reality, a magical and Manichaean world where we needn&#x27;t worry about the complexities of morality, where violence solves everything, and where the Third Reich is always just a film reel and a lit match away from cartoonish defeat&quot;. Anthony Frosh, writer for the online magazine &quot;Galus Australis&quot;, has criticized the film for failing to develop its characters sufficiently, labeling the film &quot;Enthralling, but lacking in Jewish content&quot;. Daniel Mendelsohn was critical of the film&#x27;s depiction of Jews and the overall revisionist history aspect of the film, writing &quot;Do you really want audiences cheering for a revenge that turns Jews into carboncopies of Nazis, that makes Jews into &#x27;sickening&#x27; perpetrators? I&#x27;m not so sure.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum equated the film to Holocaust denial, stating &quot;A film that didn&#x27;t even entertain me past its opening sequence, and that profoundly bored me during the endlessly protracted build-up to a cellar shoot-out, it also gave me the sort of malaise that made me wonder periodically what it was (and is) about the film that seems morally akin to Holocaust denial, even though it proudly claims to be the opposite of that.&quot; When challenged on his opinion, Rosenbaum elaborated by stating, &quot;For me, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; makes the Holocaust harder, not easier to grasp as a historical reality. Insofar as it becomes a movie convention – by which I mean a reality derived only from other movies – it loses its historical reality.&quot;

&quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; was later ranked #62 on a BBC critics&#x27; poll of the greatest films since 2000. In 2010, the &quot;Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance&quot; selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.

===Accolades===

Christoph Waltz was singled out for Cannes honors, receiving the Best Actor Award at the festival&#x27;s end. Film critic Devin Faraci of &quot;CHUD.com&quot; stated: &quot;The cry has been raised long before this review, but let me continue it: Christoph Waltz needs not an Oscar nomination but rather an actual Oscar in his hands. ... he must have gold&quot;.

The film received four Golden Globe Award nominations including Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Supporting Actor for Waltz, who went on to win the award.

The film also received three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations and went on to win the awards for Best Cast and Best Supporting Actor, which was awarded to Waltz.

The film was nominated for six BAFTA Awards, including Best Director for Tarantino, winning only one award—Best Supporting Actor for Waltz.

In February 2010, the film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Waltz, and Best Original Screenplay. Waltz was awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

<text>In Arabic music, a mizmār (; plural مَزَامِير mazāmīr) is any single or double reed wind instrument. In Egypt, the term &quot;mizmar&quot; usually refers to the conical shawm that is called &quot;zurna&quot; in Turkey and Armenia.

&quot;Mizmar&quot; is also a term used for a group of musicians, usually a duo or trio, that play a &quot;mizmar&quot; instrument along with an accompaniment of one or two double-sided bass drums, known in Arabic as &quot;tabl baladi&quot; or simply &quot;tabl.&quot; 

Mizmars are usually played in Egypt at either weddings or as an accompaniment to belly dancers. At Egyptian weddings, the Mizmar Baldi is accompanied with a belly dancer to greet the bride and groom.

In The Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, and Syria, it is influenced by the Anatolian/Armenian &quot;zurna,&quot; a higher-pitched version of the &quot;mizmar&quot;, and may also be known in those countries as a &quot;zamr&quot; (زمر) or &quot;zamour&quot;, as well as &quot;mizmar&quot;. In Algeria a similar instrument is called &quot;ghaita&quot; or &quot;rhaita&quot; (غيطة). Along with belly dancing, the mizmar may accompany the dabke, a folkloric line dance done in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq.

<text>Eliška Junková-Khásová (born Alžběta Pospíšilová; 16 November 1900 – 5 January 1994), also known as Elisabeth Junek, was a Czech automobile racer. She is regarded as one of the most significant drivers in Grand Prix motor racing history, and was the first woman to win a Grand Prix event.

==Early life==
Junková was born on 16 November 1900, in Olomouc, Moravia, Austria-Hungary listed in the registrar&#x27;s office as Betke (&quot;Betty&quot;) Pospisilová.

The sixth of eight children, born to a locksmith in Olomouc, she was nicknamed &quot;smíšek&quot; at an early age for her ever-present smile. Following the end of World War I, when her native Moravia became part of the new republic of Czechoslovakia, she found work in the Olomouc branch of the Pražská úvěrová banka (Prague Credit Bank) thanks to her multilingual skills, honed through her desire to travel the world.

At the age of sixteen, Junková got a job at a bank, where she met young banker Vincenc &quot;Čeněk&quot; Junek. He was several years older than her, and the two soon began a courtship. Upon her marriage to Vincenc she changed her first name to Eliška (&quot;Beth&quot;) and her surname Junková (the feminine of Junek in Czech)

Work took her first to Brno, then Prague, then abroad to France and Gibraltar, although bureaucracy prevented her travelling as far as North Africa, London or Ceylon, as had been her original intention. She returned to Paris to be reunited with her partner, who by this time had become wealthy enough to indulge his automotive passions. Eliška later said, &quot;If he is going to be the love of my life, then I better learn to love these damned engines.&quot; But she too soon fell for the charms of sports cars of the time, especially Bugattis. They returned to Prague in 1922, where she took clandestine driving lessons to obtain her license. Meanwhile, Čeněk had started racing in earnest. He won the Zbraslav–Jíloviště hillclimb in 1922, the year they finally married.

==Racing career==
They purchased a Mercedes that same year, and then a Bugatti Type 30 which had previously been raced in the French Grand Prix. Initially she served as riding mechanic to her husband, but a hand injury incurred during the war affected his ability to shift gears, and this afforded her the opportunity to take the wheel in his place. Eliška&#x27;s first professional race was in 1923, with Čeněk at her side. The following year, she raced by herself, winning her class at the Lochotín-Třemošná hillclimb event which made her a national celebrity overnight. She then placed first at Zbraslav-Jíloviště in 1925, and the Juneks bought a second Bugatti to celebrate, together building a close friendship with Ettore Bugatti. By 1926, Eliška Junková was confident enough to compete in races throughout Europe. She gained fame across the continent, garnering the nickname &quot;Queen of the Steering Wheel&quot;, and in the racing press of the day, Eliška became anglicized to Elizabeth. 
In 1926, she was runner up in the Klausenpass hill climb in Switzerland. She was easily identifiable for always racing in a blue skirt, white blouse, helmet and goggles.

Despite her slight stature, Eliška was a gifted technical driver, and she is often credited for being one of the first drivers to walk round a course before an event, noting landmarks and checking out the best line through the corners.

===1927 Targa Florio===
She competed in the Targa Florio in Sicily for the first time in 1927, driving a 2.3-litre Bugatti Type 35B with her husband as accompanying mechanic-passenger. This was a tough 8-hour race over mountain roads, where stamina was as necessary as speed, due to the demands of the rough and often muddy course. That year, the race was five laps of the 108 km circuit for a total of 540 km. With a strong start, at the end of the first lap, her elapsed time of 1h27m placed her fourth just ten seconds behind the works Bugatti of Emilio Materassi and ahead of the works Maserati and Peugeot. However, her impressive run ended abruptly a third of the way into the next lap when the steering gear broke, throwing them off the road. Fortunately, neither was injured and they were picked up and brought back to the startline pits by fellow driver Saverio Candrilli. This performance garnered great respect from her contemporary drivers and the spectators alike. 

Shortly thereafter, she won the Brno-Soběšice hillclimb and then also won the two-litre sports car class of the German Grand Prix at the new Nürburgring circuit, and the 50-kilometer ladies handicap organized in Montlhéry during the 24 hours of Paris.

===1928 Targa Florio===
With her sights firmly set on winning the 1928 Targa Florio, she acquired a new Type 35B to keep her competitive with the top male racers. Race organiser &quot;Conte&quot; Vincenzo Florio arranged for Vincenzo Gargotta, one of his press officers and a local resident, to accompany her on sighting laps around the course. Periodically she would stop to put chalk marks on posts, walls and trees along the route. This year, there was a strong field with works entries from Bugatti, Maserati and Alfa Romeo. On race day, the cars were flagged off at two-minute intervals, with Junková starting well into the second half of the grid, coincidentally just ahead of Candrilli again. The fastest car on the first lap was Louis Chiron in his works Bugatti, followed by Giuseppe Campari in an Alfa Romeo and Chiron&#x27;s teammate Albert Divo. Junková was a remarkable fourth on elapsed time, barely 30 seconds behind Chiron, showing her skill and the value of her meticulous preparation. On the second lap, Chiron pushed too hard and went off. Divo had pitted and this put Junková into the overall lead, having passed many of the twenty cars that had started ahead of her. Divo, an experienced Grand Prix veteran, had started just ahead of her, and, by now following closely, she was ahead of him on elapsed time. Meanwhile, Campari pushed very hard to take the lead by the end of the third lap after four and a half hours. He built his lead, only to lose time with a puncture and driving the last 10 kilometres on the wheel rim. Going into the final lap, Junková was still in second and had closed to within a minute, with Divo ten seconds back on elapsed time.
Campari crossed the line first of the leaders, but as he had started forty minutes ahead, everyone waited for the rest to arrive to determine the actual winner. First to appear was &quot;Conte&quot; Caberto Conelli in his works Bugatti T37, finishing faster than Campari. Divo came through faster still and eyes were looking for &quot;Miss Bugatti&quot; (as the locals called her). It was not to be, as in the last half of the lap she had suffered a puncture, losing two vital minutes while her husband, as mechanic, changed the tyre. The stop also overheated the engine and they were stymied by loss of radiator water, so she had to ease back to nurse the car home. She finished a creditable fifth out of only twelve finishers, eventually almost nine minutes behind the winner, Divo, and beating 25 other top drivers, including the likes of Luigi Fagioli, René Dreyfus, Ernesto Maserati and Tazio Nuvolari.

In his book &quot;My Two Lives&quot;, Dreyfus says: 

Her tenacity and determination were remarkable. For this event, she travelled to Sicily with a governess and a car like the one with which she would compete, a full month before the race. She began slowly, one lap one day, two laps the next and so on - she must have put up thirty or forty laps in that car. She knew the course better than anybody. She really pounded her Bugatti; it was a very used car by race day, but she had thought ahead of course and the Bugatti team arrived with the new car she had ordered, a T35B painted black and yellow and arranged to have delivered to the course. She was ready with her plan. In the early laps of the race she started to scare the wits out of the other drivers - being beaten by a woman was unthinkable then - and she was up with the leaders until the final lap. What she hadn&#x27;t considered in all her careful pre-race calculations and what she couldn&#x27;t have foreseen, was that mechanical problems might interfere with her plan. When they did, she was forced to drop back. Still, she finished fifth - a terrific showing. Nobody who was in that Targa, ever forgot that formidable Lady.
Vincenzo Florio warmly congratulated her at the finish and, begging Divo&#x27;s pardon, called her the moral victor of the day.

==Retirement from racing==

Two months later, back at the Nürburgring, she shared the driving with her husband in the German Grand Prix (that year run as a sports-car race). On the fifth lap, having just changed places with her, Vincent was rushing to make up lost time after a tyre change. He went wide at the Breitscheid corner, hitting a rock and rolling. Although thrown out of the car, he collapsed and died soon after from a head injury. Junková was devastated — she gave up racing and sold her vehicles. 

==Travelling==
Junková now returned to her first passion of travelling. Ettore Bugatti himself gave her a new touring car for her journey to Ceylon and hired her to seek out new business opportunities in Asia.

In 1929, Junek spent three months travelling 6000km across difficult terrain to drive two Bugatti Type 44 cars to India as part of a promotional campaign. She wasn&#x27;t very complimentary in her analysis of the cars&#x27; performance on the journey but did to sell the two Bugattis on arrival (one car still survives).

==Later life==
Eliška eventually found love again and married Czech writer Ladislav Khás shortly after the Second World War. But from 1948 to 1964, the communist authorities, disapproving of the high-flying, &quot;bourgeois&quot; lifestyle that she had lived, refused to allow her to travel abroad. Like Hellé Nice, her great female counterpart from France, she was largely forgotten by the motor racing world. In 1969 she attended the 40th anniversary of the Bugatti Owners&#x27; Club in Great Britain. In 1972, she published her autobiography &quot;Má vzpomínka je Bugatti&quot; (&quot;My memory is Bugatti&quot;). 

In 1970 she was the inspiration for the founding of the Český automobilový klub žen [Czech Women’s Automobile Club] which is still active today. 

She lived well into her nineties, long enough for the Iron Curtain to fall and for the &quot;Queen of the Steering Wheel&quot; to have her place in automotive racing history be recognized. In 1989, at the age of 89, she attended a Bugatti reunion in the United States as the guest of honour.

In 1990, Porsche design chief Anatole Lapine and Automobile magazine editor Jean Jennings drank Johnnie Walker Red with her in her apartment in the Swedish Embassy in Prague, where she recounted her racing history, including her 1928 race in the Sicilian Targa Florio in a supercharged 2.3-liter Bugatti Type35B.

== Death ==
She died on 5 January 1994, aged 93, in Prague, Czech Republic.

== Legacy ==
On 28 June 2016, the mayor of Prague 1, conveyed the honorary citizenship of Prague 1 posthumously to Eliška Junková. The ceremony was held at the Old Town Hall.

On 16 November 2020, her 120th birthday, Google recognized her by featuring a doodle with an image of her in a racecar.

<text>The Royal Naval Amateur Radio Society (RNARS) is a specialised group or club for amateur radio operators who have a link with maritime employment, such as members of a navy, merchant marine or similar employment. As such, RNARS has become a &quot;&quot; international group for such people.

RNARS is well known for fostering amateur radio stations in museum ships. The best known in the UK is HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;.

RNARS is open to membership by people from &quot;allied&quot; nations. For instance, there are members in countries such as the United States and the Netherlands, and a semi-autonomous national group in Australia that has stations in three museum ships: HMAS &quot;Vampire&quot;, HMAS &quot;Diamantina&quot;, and HMAS &quot;Castlemaine&quot;.

RNARS offers several certificates for amateurs and shortwave listeners (SWLs) who make contacts or copy transmissions by RNARS members. There is also a Morse code speed certificate.

<doc id="633057" wikidata="Q697935" url="?curid=633057" title="Presbyterian Church in Taiwan">
<text>The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT; ) is the largest Protestant Christian denomination based in Taiwan. 

The PCT is a member of the World Council of Churches, and its flag features a &quot;burning bush&quot;, which signifies the concept of burning yet not being destroyed. 

==History==
The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan was started in the 19th century by James Laidlaw Maxwell of the Presbyterian Church of England in Southern Taiwan, and George Leslie Mackay of the Presbyterian Church in Canada in Northern Taiwan. 

In Taiwan, Presbyterians have historically been active in promoting the use of the local vernacular Taiwanese, both during the Japanese colonial period, as well as after the transfer of sovereignty to the Republic of China (ROC), during which the exclusive use of Mandarin was legally mandated. 

Also, the church has historically been an active proponent of human rights and democracy in Taiwan, a tradition which began during the Japanese colonial period and extended into the &quot;White Terror&quot; period of the ROC. 

=== Pre-1945 ===
When Maxwell and Mackay arrived in Taiwan, Taiwan was under the control of the Qing dynasty from the mainland of China. In the beginning, the Taiwanese mission works were not smooth, but the missionaries persevered and continued their works. 

In 1895, as a result of Chinese defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was taken over by Japan, and the Japanese colonial period started. The PCT continued their mission work during the Japanese colonial period and dedicated themselves to the human rights of the Taiwanese people under colonization. 

The Presbyterian Church has been heavily involved in evangelization among the indigenous since the 1930s. Today, about 30 percent of the native Taiwanese belong to the denomination.

=== Post-1945 ===
After the end of World War II in 1945, the Kuomintang (KMT) party, which controlled the Chinese government at that time, took over Taiwan. However, after the loss in the Chinese Civil War, the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1949. By then, the churches in Taiwan were starting to experience conflicts due to linguistic and cultural differences. 

The most rapid church growth was experienced from 1955 to 1965 during the &quot;Double Church Movement&quot;. From 1978, the denomination was engaged in an extensive evangelization effort known as the &quot;Ten plus One Movement&quot;, aimed at 10% increase of the communicant membership each year.

During the martial law period, the Church was monitored by KMT authorities. This came to light during Taiwan’s transitional justice process.

The Kuomintang government forced the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan to withdraw from the World Council of Churches in 1970, as the WCC began supporting China&#x27;s admission to the United Nations, and admitted Chinese religious organizations to its ranks. The WCC, which is more liberal and left-wing on many issues, was condemned by the KMT as a supporter of communism, thus standing on the same side with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 

Therefore, the KMT strongly urged the PCT to withdraw from WCC membership, which the PCT rejected at first, but gave in later to political pressure. However, because of the PCT’s ongoing disobedience to the KMT government, the PCT was still condemned as disloyal to the country even after they left the WCC.

=== Three important statements ===
The fate of Taiwan dramatically changed in the 1970s because of the gradually global recognition of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which was under the CCP&#x27;s control. The KMT government in Taiwan felt extreme pressure, especially when the PRC replaced the ROC as the representative of China in the United Nations in 1971. Considering the global situation and diplomatic challenges, the PCT between 1971-1977 released three important documents in PCT history. 

Led by then General Secretary Kao Chun-ming, the PCT released the &quot;Statement of Our National Fate by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan&quot; in 1971, which asked the KMT government to give Taiwanese people the rights to decide their own future. Reverend Daniel Beeby was expelled from Taiwan in 1972 due to his support of Taiwan independence. 

Following the confiscation of the church&#x27;s Hoklo materials in 1975, the PCT published a second statement, which stressed the importance of religious freedom. The statement is called &quot;Our Appeal by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan – Concerning the Bible, the Church and the Nation&quot;, in which the PCT proposed five (5) ways that the PCT could help the government in that time. 

The PCT did not formally advocate for the Taiwan independence movement until a third statement was released in August 1977, &quot;A Declaration on Human Rights by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan&quot;. It asked the KMT government to declare Taiwan as a novel and independent country. These three documents brought much tension between the PCT and the KMT government, but at the same time they also reflected the PCT’s deep involvement in Taiwanese society beyond the religious community. 

=== Taiwanese democracy movement ===
Since the 1980s, the church formed strong ties with the Tangwai movement and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Although the PCT was never officially involved in the Taiwanese democracy movement by the name of the church, many of its members and clergy dedicated their lives to it. 

Reverend Kao was one of the most prominent figures of the movement. He was imprisoned in 1979 for assisting the leader of the Meilidao movement, Shih Ming-teh. At the same time, Elder Lin Wen-cheng was also arrested because of her involvement during the process of Shih’s hiding from the KMT government. The Meilidao movement is considered one of the most important events in the history of the Taiwanese democracy movement.

=== After martial law ===
In 1987, the KMT government finally ended the 38-year-long martial law and Taiwanese society entered a time of democratization. Even after the democratization of Taiwan, the PCT is still deeply involved in social movements, including human rights and other issues, and continues to play a significant role in Taiwanese society.

=== Indigenous rights ===
The PCT has also been a consistent and conspicuous proponent of indigenous rights:

== Governance ==
In terms of governance, the PCT has a general assembly, and only one synod (the Northern Synod); the presbyteries connect directly to the general assembly. It has 23 presbyteries and four districts. In the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, session is composed of the pastor and elders. Elders must have served two terms as deacon before becoming elders.

== Creeds ==
The church subscribes to:

*Apostles Creed
*Heidelberg Catechism
*Nicene Creed
*Westminster Confession of Faith

== Announcements &amp; Declarations ==

*Statement of Our National Fate by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (12.29.1971)

*Our Appeal by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan-Concerning the Bible, the Church and the Nation(11.18.1975)
*A Declaration on Human Rights by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (08.16.1977)

*Recommendations from the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan- Concerning the Present Situation (05.15.1990)
*The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan-A Public Statement on the Sovereignty of Taiwan (08.20.1991)

== Interchurch relations ==
The PCT is a member church of the World Council of Churches and the World Communion of Reformed Churches. It is also a member of the Council for World Mission through which it is linked in mission with 30 other churches around the world.

Immigrants from Taiwan to the United States and Canada have also started Taiwanese Hokkien churches which are closely related to the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan. While most of these churches are affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and the United Church of Canada, the liturgy and church practices are rooted in the Taiwanese Presbyterian tradition, and the pulpits are usually filled by ministers trained in the PCT.

== Affiliated Institutions ==
The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan has a number of affiliated institutions. 

=== Education ===
Universities and colleges include Aletheia University, Chang Jung Christian University, Mackay Medical College, and Mackay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management. 

The PCT has three theological institutions: the Taiwan Theological College and Seminary in Taipei (also known as Taiwan Graduate School of Theology), the Tainan Theological College and Seminary in Tainan, and the Yu-Shan Theological College and Seminary in Hualien. Secondary schools include the Tamkang Middle and High Schools and the related Suntek Elementary School in Tamsui, as well as the Changjung High School and Changjung Girls&#x27; Senior High School in Tainan.

=== Hospitals ===
The Mackay Memorial Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital and Sin-Lau Hospital are affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan.

=== Media ===
In 1885, the PCT published the printed newspaper in Taiwanese history, the &quot;Taiwan Church News&quot; (which was first called &quot;Taiwan Prefecture City Church News&quot;).

In 2004, the PCT established &quot;News Eyes Television&quot;, which aims to serve the Christians in Taiwan and abroad. At the same time, News Eyes Television also visions to be an anchor in global mission works.

<text>A police authority in the United Kingdom is a public authority that is responsible for overseeing the operations of a police force. The nature and composition of police authorities has varied over time, and there are now just four dedicated &quot;police authorities&quot; in the United Kingdom, although the term can refer to various similar successor bodies.

Until 2012/13, individual police authorities were maintained for each of the 43 territorial police forces in England and Wales, and for the 8 territorial police forces in Scotland. Police authorities in England and Wales were abolished in November 2012, and replaced with directly elected police and crime commissioners, and those in Scotland were merged in April 2013 to form the Scottish Police Authority as part of the creation of Police Scotland, the single police force for Scotland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is overseen by the Northern Ireland Policing Board, and two of the three UK-wide special police forces continue to be overseen by individual police authorities. The oversight of the two police forces serving London continues to be implemented via unique arrangements.

==England and Wales==

===Early history to 1964===
The introduction of police forces on a national scale in England and Wales began with the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which required each borough to establish a &quot;watch committee&quot; and thus appoint constables to &quot;preserve the peace&quot;. Before the advent of police authorities, the regulatory bodies for police forces confined to a single borough were these watch committees, whilst those for counties from 1889 had been &quot;standing joint committees&quot; (after 1889 some control passed to the elected county council; the joint committee also had magistrates).

===1964: creation of independent police authorities===
The Police Act 1964 introduced major reforms to the organisation and oversight of the police in England and Wales, following the report of the Royal Commission on the Police in 1962. The 1964 act abolished the old watch committee system which had come under severe criticism following several high-profile corruption scandals.

The act introduced police areas, which would be administrative counties, county boroughs or &quot;combined police areas&quot;, consisting of combinations of counties and county boroughs, served by a single force, overseen by an independent &quot;police authority&quot;. The new police authorities would consist of two-thirds elected members of county or borough councils, and one-third magistrates. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the remaining borough police forces were abolished, and police authorities consisted of county councillors and magistrates in a ratio of two to one.

The Police and Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1994 altered the composition of the authorities with independent members being added. Typically, a police authority was made up of seventeen members – nine elected members (who were drawn from the local authority or authorities for the force area, and would be reflective of the political makeup of those authorities). The remaining eight members were called independent members, and were appointed from the local community for fixed terms of four years by the police authority itself - a long list, from applications received, was submitted by a committee of elected members and magistrates to the Home Office. That committee then appointed the independent members from a shortlist returned by the Home Office. At least three of the police authority&#x27;s independent members were magistrates. There was no difference in power or responsibility between the different types of member – there were examples of elected, independent and magistrate members chairing police authorities throughout England and Wales.

====Funding====
The bulk of police funding came from the Home Office in the form of an annual grant (calculated on a proportionate basis by the Home Office to take into account the differences between the 43 forces in England and Wales, which vary significantly in terms of population, geographical size and crime levels and trends), though police authorities could also set a precept on the Council Tax to raise additional funds. The Home Office had the power to prevent any precept increases deemed to be excessive. It was the police authority&#x27;s responsibility to set the budget for the force area, which included allocating itself enough money from the overall policing budget to ensure that it can discharge its own functions effectively.

In its annual Policing Plan, a police authority was obliged to publish its budget for the year, as well as a value for money statement and to outline planned efficiency savings.

====Inspections====
Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Audit Commission (or the Welsh Audit Commission in Wales) began a programme of inspection for police authorities in September 2009. Inspection scores four areas of police authority capability:
* Setting strategic direction and priorities
* Scrutinising performance outcomes
* Achieving results through community engagement and partnerships
* Ensuring value for money and productivity
Each theme was scored from one to four:
# Performs poorly
# Performs adequately
# Performs well
# Performs excellently
The police authority was also given an overall score using the same 1-4 system.

Ten inspection reports were published, with the majority of inspected authorities scoring 2. The inspectorates published &quot;Learning Lessons: An overview of the first ten joint inspections of police authorities by HMIC and the Audit Commission&quot;, outlining their findings from the first ten inspections, in March 2010.

===2012: abolition of police authorities in England and Wales===
In the 2010 British general election campaign, both the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats&#x27; manifestos outlined plans, respectively, to replace or reform police authorities, both parties raising concerns about the perceived lack of accountability of police authorities to the communities they served. The Conservatives proposed to replace them with a single elected individual (a &#x27;police and crime commissioner&#x27;, criticised as a model by some in policing), whilst the Liberal Democrats proposed to introduce direct elections to police authorities, whilst strengthening their powers. Following Royal Assent of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 police authorities were abolished and replaced with directly elected police and crime commissioners on 22 November 2012. Many of the outgoing members of police authorities stood for the role of PCC, highlighting their successive experience in the field, and many were elected.

===London===
The Metropolitan Police and City of London Police have historically been exceptions to the national rule. The Metropolitan Police were under the direct control of the Home Secretary from their establishment in 1829 until 2000, when the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) was established under the Greater London Authority to oversee the force. The MPA was replaced in January 2012, alongside the introduction of police and crime commissioners, by the Mayor&#x27;s Office for Policing and Crime, under the control of the Mayor of London, and reporting to the Police and Crime Committee of the London Assembly. Unlike the other police forces in England and Wales, where the chief officer is appointed by the locally elected police and crime commissioner, the national and international importance of the work of the Metropolitan Police means the appointment of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is still in the hands of the Home Secretary (and constitutionally made by the Monarch), although they must &quot;have regard to any recommendations made&quot; by the Mayor of London since the introduction of that position in 2000.

The City of London Corporation has been the police authority for the City of London Police since their formal establishment in 1839. Despite the introduction of police and crime commissioners in 2012, the function of the Corporation as the police authority was retained by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011. This function is currently exercised by the Police Authority Board of the Court of Common Council, the elected body that runs the Corporation. Eleven of the members of the Board — including the chair and their deputy — are elected members of the Common Council, and the other three are appointed independent members. The appointment of the Commissioner of the City of London Police is now made by the Common Council (although technically by the Monarch).

==Northern Ireland==
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is supervised by the Northern Ireland Policing Board, of which ten are members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and nine are independent. The Board and the PSNI are the successors to the Police Authority for Northern Ireland and Royal Ulster Constabulary respectively, who they replaced on 4 November 2001.

==Scotland==
In Scotland, supervision of the police was historically the responsibility of the elected local authority which either directly supervised the local police force where its border was conterminous with the force, or through joint boards with neighbouring local authorities where one forces covered more than one council area. The eight territorial police forces in Scotland were replaced in April 2013 by Police Scotland, which is overseen by the Scottish Police Authority, an independent public body that reports to the Scottish Parliament. The SPA also incorporated the Scottish Police Services Authority, which was the police authority for the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (itself merged into Police Scotland).

===Single authority===
The following police forces were supervised by one single local authority:
===Joint police boards===
The following police forces were supervised by a joint board:
==Special police forces==
The various special police forces in the United Kingdom each have different oversight arrangements.

===British Transport Police===
The British Transport Police, a privately funded police force responsible for policing the railways of Great Britain, is overseen by the British Transport Police Authority. The Authority was created in 2004 by the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 and is made up of approximately 12-15 members, each of whom represents groups concerned with the control, operation or use of the railways. They include representatives of the railway operators, railway users (freight and passenger), employees and the appropriate government departments dealing with transport in England, Scotland and Wales.

===Civil Nuclear Constabulary===
The Civil Nuclear Constabulary, which polices nuclear power-related facilities and shipments in the United Kingdom, is overseen by the Civil Nuclear Police Authority. The Authority was created in 2004 by the Energy Act 2004; it is made up of eight members; four are nominated by the nuclear industry, while the remaining four include the Chairman.

===Ministry of Defence Police===
The Ministry of Defence Police does not have a police authority; however, the Ministry of Defence Police Committee, established by the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987, advises the Secretary of State for Defence on matters concerning the Ministry of Defence Police. The Committee (or its members) also has various functions in determining police misconduct and appeals cases.

<text>The Battle of Vyšehrad was a series of engagements at the start of the Hussite War between Hussite forces and Catholic crusaders sent by Emperor Sigismund. The battle took place at the castle of Vyšehrad from 16 August 1419 to c. 1 November 1420.

==Start of the battle==
After the death of King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, Queen Sophia (with the help of Čeněk of Wartenberg) tried to gain control of Prague. Sophia and Čeněk recruited soldiers from Germany, who took up positions at Vyšehrad, Hradčany, and at the archbishop&#x27;s palace and the cloister of St. Thomas in a part of Prague called New Town. The Hussite uprising was successful in other parts of Bohemia, and the towns of Klatovy, Písek, Louny, Žatec, and Plzeň came under Hussite control. On 25 October 1419, Hussites captured Vyšehrad as well.

In November 1419, fighting took place between Catholic fighters under Petr from Šternberk and Hussite peasants under the command of a priest, Ambrosius. These Hussites went from the area near Usti to Prague, surrounded Novy Knin, and attacked. After gaining reinforcements, Ambrosius&#x27;s forces crossed the Vltava River. The Hussites won the battle but lost about 300 people.

After taking Prague, the Hussites decided to assist citizens in Novy Knin. More fighting commenced as Hussite fighters captured the bridge to New Town on the Vltava River. Catholic soldiers who guarded the bridge were forced to withdraw to Hradcany, but many buildings in New Town were destroyed.

On 13 November 1419 Queen Sophia promised to protect the Hussites in all of Bohemia. Utraquists gave back Vyšehrad to the royal army.

==Battle under Nekmierz==
Later in November, formations of Taborites, several hundred strong, left Prague. In December 1419, one of these formations under the command of Jan Žižka was surprised by Catholic forces under the command of Bohuslav of Švamberk. A cavalry attack at Nekmierz (Nekmer) castle near Plzeň (Pilsen) by the Catholics was stopped by crossbow and gunfire from Hussite soldiers hiding behind wagons. Catholic infantry and cavalry were forced to withdraw. After the battle Žižka ordered a night march to Plzeň.

In the Spring of 1420, after capturing the town of Sezimovo Ústí (German: &quot;Aussig&quot;), Hussite forces went to a hill near the Lužnice river where they built a new town which they named Tábor after the biblical Mount Tabor (but the noun means also &quot;camp&quot;). This new town became the capital of the Taborites&#x27; collective. Citizens of Tábor chose four hetmen, or generals: Nicholas of Husí, Jan Žižka, Zbyněk of Buchovo, and Chval of Machovice.

Similar army camps were also built, notably one on the mountain of Oreb, where another group of radical Hussites established themselves, and became known as the Orebici (Orebites). Their civil leader was the priest Ambrosius, and their hetman was Hynek Krušina from Lichtenburk.

==Battle at Sudoměř==
The Hussites lost Plzeň, in arrangement with the Catholics. Hussites, under command of Jan Žižka, were allowed to leave the town without difficulties. Catholics from Plzen sent information about Žižka&#x27;s forces to Jindrich from hradce master of knights of St. John of Jerusalem and Bohuslav from Švamberk. After massing at Sudoměř, they decided to attack; they had more soldiers than Žižka, as well as reinforcements from Písek. In the opinion of writers of chronicles, the attackers would not have had to fight with the Hussites because the few rebels would be trampled to death beneath the horses&#x27; hooves.

Žižka deployed his men on a small dam between two ponds, one of which was without water. The backs of the Hussites were protected by a swamp. The Catholic commanders divided their forces into two groups. The first group assaulted the Hussites from the front, and sustained heavy casualties. The second group of knights crossed the empty pond and attacked on foot. Soon the field of battle was covered by fog, and the Catholics withdrew, both sides having suffered heavy losses.

In May 1420 Čeněk von Wartenberg surrounded Hradčany and joined Emperor Sigismund&#x27;s side. Soldiers from Vyšehrad advanced on New Town. The Hussites begun a siege of Vyšehrad.
In June 1420 there was a successful advance from Vyšehrad. Soldiers from this castle secured supplies which were sent to Hradčany.

==Siege of Prague==
On 12 June 1420, some formations of Sigismund&#x27;s forces successfully entered Hradčany with supplies. They took horses from the castle.

At the time of the Prague siege, Sigismund&#x27;s soldiers, who were placed in Hradčany and Vyšehrad, advanced on the Hussites&#x27; position in Prague. After a successful defence of Vítkov Hill and the crusaders&#x27; withdrawal, the Hussites begun artillery fire on Vyšehrad, but received heavier losses than Prague&#x27;s defenders.

After an unsuccessful assault on Vítkov Hill, the crusaders decided to attack the local Hussites&#x27; position. In August 1420, Hetman Jan Žižka left Prague with relief forces and headed to Písek, which was in danger from crusaders under the command of Oldřich from Rožmberk. 15 September 1420 saw the beginning of a second siege of Vysehrad. In the last days of October, the commandant of the castle accepted a capitulation arrangement. If he didn&#x27;t receive any help from Sigismund&#x27;s forces by 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning of 1 November 1420, he would surrender the castle. Meanwhile, another formation of Taborites, among them commander Jan Roháč z Dubé, captured the town of Lomnice.

==Battle of Vyšehrad==
Sigismund planned a main attack using soldiers from Hradčany and Vyšehrad, and counting on reinforcements from Plzeň Union. The plan of battle was sent to Hradčany and Vyšehrad by courier, but the courier was captured by Hussites. The Hussites sent some soldiers under the command of Jan Žižka to stop the march of soldiers from Plzeň.

Hussite artillery fire successfully stopped the attack of the Hungarian and German cavalry. Then the Hussite forces made their attack. After the battle, the crusaders&#x27; formations withdrew. Four hundred knights were killed by the Hussites, who didn&#x27;t take any prisoners of war. Among the dead were , , , , and .

1 November saw the capitulation of soldiers from Vyšehrad. Žižka&#x27;s forces captured Zlaté Korouny and Prachatice. December 1420 saw the death of Nicholas from Husí.

==Aftermath==
In January 1421, Taborite forces, under command of Jan Žižka and Chval from Machovice, captured the town of Stříbro and cloister in Krakikov. The commandant of Stříbro Castle, Bohuslav of Švamberk, surrendered; his soldiers were free to go. Because Sigismund didn&#x27;t send a ransom for him, Bohuslav decided to join the Hussites. Eventually the Taborites chose him as their hetman.

In February, Emperor Sigismund withdrew to Moravia and then to Hungary. June 1421 saw the capitulation of the soldiers in Hradčany.

<text>The zurna (Armenian: զուռնա zuṙna; Old Armenian: սուռնայ suṙna; Albanian: surle/surla; Romanian: surlă; Persian: karna/Kornay/surnay; Macedonian: зурла/сурла zurla/surla; Bulgarian: &quot;зурна/зурла&quot;; Hungarian: zurna/töröksip; Serbian: зурла/zurla; Assyrian: ܙܘܪܢܐ/zurna; Tat: zurna; Turkish: zurna; Kurdish: zirne; Greek: ζουρνάς; Azerbaijani: zurna; Sinhalese: හොරණෑව[horaṇǣva]) is a double reed wind instrument played in Central Asia, West Asia, the Caucasus, Southeast Europe and parts of North Africa. It is also used in Sri Lanka. It is usually accompanied by a davul (bass drum) in Armenian, Anatolian and Assyrian folk music.

== Etymology and terminology ==

A folk etymology explains that the name is derived from Persian &quot;&quot; (&quot;surnāy&quot;), composed of &quot;&quot; (&quot;sūr&quot;) meaning &quot;banquet, feast&quot;, and (&quot;nāy&quot;) meaning &quot;reed, pipe&quot;. The term is attested in the oldest Turkic records, as &quot;suruna&quot; in the 12th and 13th century Codex Cumanicus (CCM fol. 45a). Zurna has also been suggested as a possible borrowing from Hittite or Luwian into the Armenian language, where Arm. զուռնա &quot;zuṙna&quot; is compared to Luwian &quot;zurni&quot; &quot;horn&quot;. 

==Origins==
The zurna was said to originate from Central Asia and ancient Asia Minor (Anatolia). Images of the zurna are visible in stone reliefs and artwork by the Hittites, who were an ancient empire from Asia Minor about 2000 to 1200 B.C. It was known in Persia from 6th century A.D., and later introduced in several countries following the spread of Islam (A.D. 650-1500). 
The zurna played an important role in Ottoman mehter music.

As zurna became popular and intriguing, it spread further to the east and west. In the 16th century, the Central Asian shawms got to China under the name &#x27;sona&#x27;. The Kirghiz peoples, from ancient Persia and Afghanistan, had used the zurna, as well as Syrian people, who called it &#x27;zamr&#x27;. As the Ottoman Empire sprawled into Europe, the zurna was introduced to the Balkans, Hungary, and even Western Europe. There were alteration of name and its structure, but the similarities to the original zurna was very apparent, as seen in the zurna of Macedonia, the shepherd flute of the Basque and the mountain territories of Italy, and the zurna in North Africa, called &#x27;zmar&#x27;, of Tunis and Tangier.

In Turkish folk music, the zurna joined with the davul to appoint a melodic concomitant to tribal and village folk dance. Today, the zurna is an essential part of Turkish folk music and dance, as well as in Armenian dance, Assyrian folk dance and Kurdish dance. 

Turkish lore says that Adam, who was moulded from clay, had no soul. It is said only the melodious tuiduk-playing of Archangel Gabriel could breathe life into Adam. According to a Turkmen legend, the devil played the main role in tuiduk invention (note the term &quot;devil openings&quot;, &quot;şeytan delikleri&quot;, in Turkish for the small apertures on the bell).

==Characteristics==
The zurna, like the duduk and kaval, is a woodwind instrument used to play folk music.

The zurna is made from the slow-growing and hardwood of fruit trees such as plum or apricot (&quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot;). There are several different types of zurnas. The most typical is the Armenian zurna. The longest (and lowest-pitched) is the kaba zurna, used in Bulgaria, the shortest (and highest-pitched), which can be made of bone, is the zurna played in Messolonghi and other villages of Aetolia-Acarnania region in Greece. The zurna, a relative of the oboe, is found almost everywhere where the common reed grows because it uses a short cylindrical reed that is tied to a conical brass tube on one end, flattened to a narrow slit on the other end as a source of the sound.

It requires high pressure to give any tone at all and when it does, it is almost constantly loud, high pitched, sharp, and piercing. The need for high pressure makes it suitable for playing without stop using circular breathing. A small pacifier-style disk that the lips may lean on helps the lip muscles that hold the high-pressure air, rest, and recover during long non-stop playing sessions. The combination of constant volume and non-stop playing makes the zurna unsuitable for emphasis of the rhythm. It has therefore been played almost invariably along with big drums that both provide the rhythm and the lower frequencies that travel further away than the zurna&#x27;s loud, high pitched sound.

It has a cylindrical bore, and a bell opening out in a parabolic curve, thus adapted to reflect the sound straight ahead. Because of its loud and highly directional sound as well as accompaniment by big drums, it has historically been played outdoors, during festive events such as weddings and public celebrations. It has also been used to gather crowds in order to make official announcements. This use of the zurna as a token of the ruling power developed into Janissary bands and eventually into military music. Seven holes on the front, and one thumb hole, provide a range of over one octave including some transposition.

==Usage==
Similar to the mizmar and rhaita, zurnas are used in the folk music of many countries and regions, especially in Armenia, Iran, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Central Asia, Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, North Macedonia,  The Maghreb, Albania, Serbia, Bosnia, Kurdistan and the other Caucasian countries, and have now spread throughout India, China, Korea and Eastern Europe. 

The zurna is most likely the immediate predecessor of the European shawm, and is related to the Chinese suona still used today in weddings, temple and funeral music. The Japanese &quot;charumera&quot;, or &quot;charamera&quot;, traditionally associated with itinerant noodle vendors is a small zurna, its name derived from the Portuguese &quot;chirimoya&quot;. Few, if any, noodle vendors continue this tradition, and those who do would use a loudspeaker playing a recorded charumera.

A zurna was used by frontman Stu Mackenzie in King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard&#x27;s 9th studio album, Flying Microtonal Banana.

The Homeworld series uses a zurna quite extensively in its soundtrack, particularly in more action-focused pieces

<text>Docking or bobbing is the removal of portions of an animal&#x27;s tail. It should not be confused with &quot;cropping&quot;, the amputation of ears. Tail docking may be performed cutting the tail with surgical scissors (or a scalpel) or constricting the blood supply to the tail with a rubber ligature for a few days until the tail falls off. The length to which tails are docked varies by breed, and is often specified in the breed standard.
Docking is illegal, or restricted, in many countries.
Some dog breeds have naturally occurring bobtail lines. These appear similar to docked dogs but are a distinct naturally occurring phenotype.

==History==

===Purpose===
Historically, tail docking was thought to prevent rabies, strengthen the back, increase the animal&#x27;s speed, and prevent injuries when ratting, fighting, and baiting.

Tail docking is done in modern times either for prophylactic, therapeutic, cosmetic purposes, and/or to prevent injury. For dogs that work in the field, such as some hunting dogs, herding dogs, or terrier dogs, tails can collect burrs and foxtails, causing pain and infection and, due to the tail&#x27;s wagging, may be subject to abrasion or other injury while moving through dense brush or thickets. Bones in the tail can also be broken by pulling or impact in the field, causing spinal injury to the tail. The American Veterinary Medical Association (the largest veterinary professional organization in the United States), disputes these justifications, saying &quot;These justifications for docking working dogs&#x27; tails lack substantial scientific support. In the largest study to date on tail injuries in dogs the incidence was 0.23% and it was calculated that approximately 500 dogs need to be docked to prevent one tail injury.&quot;
===Modern practice===
Docking of puppies younger than 10 to 14 days old is routinely carried out by both breeders and veterinarians without anesthesia.

While the tails of some working dogs are docked to prevent injury or infection, the tails of larger dogs commonly used for guard work or protection work (not to be confused with patrol work where a handler can provide secondary aid) may be docked to prevent their tails from being grabbed in a fight. This is most common in the Rottweiler, Doberman Pinscher, Bandog, Cane Corso, Boerboel, etc.

===Criticism===
Robert Wansborough found in a 1996 paper
that docking tails puts dogs at a disadvantage in several ways. First, dogs use their tails to communicate with other dogs (and with people); a dog without a tail might be significantly handicapped in conveying fear, caution, aggression, playfulness, and so on. Leaver and Reimchen, in 2007, found that longer tails were more effective than shorter tails at &quot;conveying different intraspecific cues, such as those provided by tail motion&quot;.

It has also been suggested that certain breeds use their tails as rudders when swimming, and possibly for balance when running; so active dogs with docked tails might be at a disadvantage compared to their tailed peers. Videos comparing docked and undocked dogs running and jumping show that dogs who are docked have to work harder to compensate for the loss of the tail. Canine pathologist and sports-medicine expert Prof. Chris Zink believes the extra stress imposed on the joints can have long-term health consequences.

In 2007, Stephen Leaver, a graduate student at the University of Victoria, published a paper on tail docking which found that tail length was important in the transmission of social cues. The study found that dogs with shorter tails (docked tails) would be approached with caution, as if the approaching dog was unsure of the emotional state of the docked dog. The study goes on to suggest that dogs with docked tails may grow up to be more aggressive. The reasoning postulated by Tom Reimchen, UVic Biologist and supervisor of the study, was that dogs who grew up without being able to efficiently transmit social cues would grow up to be more anti-social and thus more aggressive.

H. Lee Robinson argues that reported concerns of tail docking lack empirical evidence, and is primarily supported by animal rights activists that lack experience with working dogs. Robinson suggests that docking the tail of working dogs at approximately one half length provides the benefits of injury prevention and infection prevention, while also maintaining enough tail length to be used for social communication. Robinson, however, is not a veterinarian or researcher but the owner of American Sentinel K9, which derives income from dogs who have been docked.

Docking has been condemned by the American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Animal Hospital Association, and the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association. These organizations have also called on breed organizations to remove docking from all breed standards.

===Influence of kennel clubs===
Critics point out that kennel clubs with breed standards that do not make allowance for uncropped or undocked dogs put pressure on owners and breeders to continue the practice. Although the American Kennel Club (AKC) says that it has no rules that require docking or that make undocked animals ineligible for the show ring, standards for many breeds put undocked animals at a disadvantage for the conformation show ring. The American breed standard for boxers, for example, recommends that an undocked tail be &quot;severely penalized.&quot;

The AKC position is that ear cropping and tail docking are &quot;acceptable practices integral to defining and preserving breed character and/or enhancing good health,&quot; even though the practice is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association.

==Legal status==
Today, many countries ban cropping and docking because they consider the practices unnecessary, painful, cruel or mutilation. In Europe, the cropping of ears is prohibited in all countries that have ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals. Some countries that ratified the convention made exceptions for tail docking.

===United Kingdom===
Show dogs are no longer docked in the United Kingdom. A dog docked before 28 March 2007 in Wales and 6 April 2007 in England may continue to be shown at all shows in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland throughout its life. A dog docked on, or after, the above dates, regardless of where it was docked, may not be shown at shows in England and Wales where the public is charged a fee for admission. Where a working dog has been docked in England and Wales under the respective regulations, however, it may be shown where the public is charged a fee, so long as it is shown &quot;only to demonstrate its working ability.&quot; It will thus be necessary to show working dogs in such a way as to demonstrate their working ability and not conformity to a standard. A dog legally docked in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, or abroad may be shown at any show in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, ear cropping is illegal, and no dog with cropped ears can take part in any Kennel Club event (including agility and other non-conformation events). Tail docking is also illegal, except for a few working breeds; this exemption applies only when carried out by a registered veterinary surgeon.

The Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes the docking of dogs&#x27; tails a criminal offence, except for working dogs such as those used by the police force, the military, rescue services, pest control, and those used in connection with lawful animal shooting. Three options were presented to Parliament in March 2006 with Parliament opting for the second:
* An outright ban on docking dogs&#x27; tails (opposed by a majority of 278 to 267)
* A ban on docking dogs&#x27; tails with an exception for working dogs (supported by a majority of 476 to 63)
* Retention of the status quo.

Those convicted of unlawful docking are liable to a fine of up to £20,000, up to 69 weeks of imprisonment, or both.

Prior to the ban, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), the regulatory body for veterinary surgeons in the United Kingdom, had stated in the 1990s that they considered tail docking to be &quot;an unjustified mutilation and unethical unless done for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons.&quot; In 1995, a veterinary surgeon was brought before the RCVS disciplinary council for &quot;disgraceful professional conduct&quot; for carrying out cosmetic docking. The surgeon claimed that the docking was performed to prevent future injuries, and the case was dismissed for lack of evidence otherwise. Although cosmetic docking was still considered unacceptable by the RCVS, no further disciplinary action was taken against vets performing docking prior to the implementation of the ban.

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, legislation known as Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 made tail docking illegal except for certain working dogs.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, docking of any breed is illegal. The Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 contains provisions prohibiting the mutilation of domesticated animals. However, the Scottish government has carried out a consultation on this issue and declared that they intend to legislate to bring the law in Scotland in line with the law in England and Wales, meaning that there will be an exemption for certain breeds of working dogs. This is due to the increase in serious spinal trauma reported in field dogs with undocked tails.

<text>A school bus is any type of bus owned, leased, contracted to, or operated by a school or school district. It is regularly used to transport students to and from school or school-related activities, but not including a charter bus or transit bus. Various configurations of school buses are used worldwide; the most iconic examples are the yellow school buses of the United States which are also found in other parts of the world.

In North America, school buses are purpose-built vehicles distinguished from other types of buses by design characteristics mandated by federal and state/provincial regulations. In addition to their distinct paint color (National School Bus Glossy Yellow), school buses are fitted with exterior warning lights (to give them traffic priority) and multiple safety devices.

==Design history==
===19th century===


In the second half of the 19th century, many rural areas of the United States and Canada were served by one-room schools. For those students who lived beyond practical walking distance from school, transportation was facilitated in the form of the kid hack; at the time, &quot;hack&quot; was a term referring to certain types of horse-drawn carriages. Essentially re-purposed farm wagons, kid hacks were open to the elements, with little to no weather protection.

In 1892, Indiana-based Wayne Works (later Wayne Corporation) produced its first &quot;school car&quot; A purpose-built design, the school car was constructed with perimeter-mounted wooden bench seats and a roof (the sides remained open). As a horse-drawn wagon, the school car was fitted with a rear entrance door (intended to avoid startling the horses while loading or unloading passengers); over a century later, the design remains in use (as an emergency exit).

In 1869, Massachusetts became the first state to add transportation to public education; by 1900, 16 other states would transport students to school.

===1900–1930===

Following the first decade of the twentieth century, several developments would affect the design of the school bus and student transport. As vehicles evolved from horse-drawn to &quot;horseless&quot; propulsion on a wider basis, the wagon bodies of kid hacks and school cars were adapted to truck frames. While transitioning into purpose-built designs, a number of features from wagons were retained, including wood construction, perimeter bench seating, and rear entry doors. Weather protection remained minimal; some designs adopted a tarpaulin stretched above the passenger seating.

In 1915, International Harvester constructed its first school bus; today, its successor company Navistar still produces school bus cowled chassis.

In 1919, the usage of school buses became funded in all 48 US states.

In 1927, Ford dealership owner A.L. Luce produced a bus body for a 1927 Ford Model T. The forerunner of the first Blue Bird school buses, steel was used to panel and frame the bus body; wood was relegated to a secondary material. While fitted with a roof, the primary weather protection of the Luce bus design included roll-up canvas side curtains.

=== 1930s ===

During the 1930s, school buses saw advances in their design and production that remain in use to this day. To better adapt automotive chassis design, school bus entry doors were moved from the rear to the front curbside, becoming a door operated by the driver (to ease loading passengers and improve forward visibility). The rear entry door of the kid hacks were re-purposed as an emergency exit.

Following the introduction of the steel-paneled 1927 Luce bus, school bus manufacturing began to transition towards all-steel construction. In 1930, both Superior and Wayne introduced all-steel school buses; the latter introduced safety glass windows for its bus body.

As school bus design paralleled the design of light to medium-duty commercial trucks of the time, the advent of forward-control trucks would have their own influence on school bus design. In an effort to gain extra seating capacity and visibility, Crown Coach built its own cabover school bus design from the ground up. Introduced in 1932, the Crown Supercoach seated up to 76 passengers, the highest-capacity school bus of the time.

As the 1930s progressed, flat-front school buses began to follow motorcoach design in styling as well as engineering, gradually adopting the term &quot;transit-style&quot; for their appearance. In 1940, the first mid-engined transit school bus was produced by Gillig in California.

====Developing production standards====
The custom-built nature of school buses created an inherent obstacle to their profitable mass production on a large scale. Although school bus design had moved away from the wagon-style kid hacks of the generation before, there was not yet a recognized set of industry-wide standards for school buses.

In 1939, rural education expert Dr. Frank W. Cyr organized a week-long conference at Teachers College, Columbia University that introduced new standards for the design of school buses. Funded by a $5,000 grant, Dr. Cyr invited transportation officials, representatives from body and chassis manufacturers, and paint companies. To reduce the complexity of school bus production and increase safety, a set of 44 standards were agreed upon and adopted by the attendees (such as interior and exterior dimensions and the forward-facing seating configuration). To allow for large-scale production of school buses among body manufacturers, adoption of these standards allowed for greater consistency among body manufacturers.

While many of the standards of the 1939 conference have been modified or updated, one part of its legacy remains a key part of every school bus in North America today: the adoption of a standard paint color for all school buses. While technically named &quot;National School Bus Glossy Yellow&quot;, school bus yellow was adopted for use since it was considered easiest to see in dawn and dusk, and it contrasted well with black lettering. While not universally used worldwide, yellow has become the shade most commonly associated with school buses both in North America and abroad.

===1940s===
During WWII school bus manufacturers converted to military production, manufacturing buses and license-built trucks for the military. Following the war, school bus operation would see a number of changes, following developments within education systems.

Following WWII and the rise of suburban growth in North America, demand for school busing increased outside of rural areas; in suburbs and larger urban areas, community design often made walking to school impractical beyond a certain distance from home (particularly as students progressed into high school). In all but the most isolated areas, one-room schools from the turn of the century had become phased out in favor of multi-grade schools introduced in urban areas. In another change, school districts shifted bus operation from buses operated by single individuals to district-owned fleets (operated by district employees).

=== 1950s–1960s ===

From 1950 to 1982, the baby boomer generation was either in elementary or high school, leading to a significant increase in student populations across North America; this would be a factor that would directly influence school bus production for over three decades.

During the 1950s, as student populations began to grow, larger school buses began to enter production. To increase seating capacity (extra rows of seats), manufacturers began to produce bodies on heavier-duty truck chassis; transit-style school buses also grew in size. In 1954, the first diesel-engined school bus was introduced, with the first tandem-axle school bus in 1955 (a Crown Supercoach, expanding seating to 91 passengers).

To improve accessibility, at the end of the 1950s, manufacturers developed a curbside wheelchair lift option to transport wheelchair-using passengers. In modified form, the design remains in use today.

During the 1950s and 1960s, manufacturers also began to develop designs for small school buses, optimized for urban routes with crowded, narrow streets along with rural routes too isolated for a full-size bus. For this role, manufacturers initially began the use of yellow-painted utility vehicles such as the International Travelall and Chevrolet Suburban. As another alternative, manufacturers began use of passenger vans, such as the Chevrolet Van/GMC Handi-Van, Dodge A100, and Ford Econoline; along with yellow paint, these vehicles were fitted with red warning lights. While more maneuverable, automotive-based school buses did not offer the reinforced passenger compartment of a full-size school bus.

==== Structural integrity ====
During the 1960s, as with standard passenger cars, concerns began to arise for passenger protection in catastrophic traffic collisions. At the time, the weak point of the body structure was the body joints; where panels and pieces were riveted together, joints could break apart in major accidents, with the bus body causing harm to passengers.

After subjecting a bus to a rollover test in 1964, in 1969, Ward Body Works pointing that fasteners had a direct effect on joint quality (and that body manufacturers were using relatively few rivets and fasteners). In its own research, Wayne Corporation discovered that the body joints were the weak points themselves. In 1973, to reduce the risk of body panel separation, Wayne introduced the Wayne Lifeguard, a school bus body with single-piece body side and roof stampings. While single-piece stampings seen in the Lifeguard had their own manufacturing challenges, school buses of today use relatively few side panels to minimize body joints.

===1970s===

During the 1970s, school buses would undergo a number of design upgrades related to safety. While many changes were related to protecting passengers, others were intended to minimize the chances of traffic collisions. To decrease confusion over traffic priority (increasing safety around school bus stops), federal and state regulations were amended, requiring for many states/provinces to add amber warning lamps inboard of the red warning lamps. Similar to a yellow traffic light, the amber lights are activated before stopping (at distance), indicating to drivers that a school bus is about to stop and unload/load students. Adopted by a number of states during the mid-1970s, amber warning lights became nearly universal equipment on new school buses by the end of the 1980s. To supplement the additional warning lights and to help prevent drivers from passing a stopped school bus, a stop arm was added to nearly all school buses; connected to the wiring of the warning lights, the deployable stop arm extended during a bus stop with its own set of red flashing lights.

In the 1970s, school busing expanded further, under controversial reasons; a number of larger cities began to bus students in an effort to racially integrate schools. Out of necessity, the additional usage created further demand for bus production.

==== Industry safety regulations ====
From 1939 to 1973, school bus production was largely self-regulated. In 1973, the first federal regulations governing school buses went into effect, as FMVSS 217 was required for school buses; the regulation governed specifications of rear emergency exit doors/windows. Following the focus on school bus structural integrity, NHTSA introduced the four &quot;Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for School Buses,&quot; applied on April 1, 1977, bringing significant change to the design, engineering, and construction of school buses and a substantial improvement in safety performance.

While many changes related to the 1977 safety standards were made under the body structure (to improve crashworthiness), the most visible change was to passenger seating. In place of the metal-back passenger seats seen since the 1930s, the regulations introduced taller seats with thick padding on both the front and back, acting as a protective barrier. Further improvement has resulted from continuing efforts by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Transport Canada, as well as by the bus industry and various safety advocates. As of 2020 production, all of these standards remain in effect.

As manufacturers sought to develop safer school buses, small school buses underwent a transition away from automotive-based vehicles. The introduction of cutaway van chassis allowed bus manufacturers to mate a van cab with a purpose-built bus body, using the same construction as a full-size school bus. Within the same length as a passenger van, buses such as the Wayne Busette and Blue Bird Micro Bird offered additional seating capacity, wheelchair lifts, and the same body construction as larger school buses.
===1980s–1990s===
For school bus manufacturers, the 1980s marked a period of struggle, following a combination of factors. As the decade began, the end of the baby-boom generation had finished high school; with a decrease in student population growth, school bus manufacturing was left with a degree of overcapacity. Coupled with the recession economy of the early 1980s, the decline in demand for school bus production left several manufacturers in financial ruin. To better secure their future, during the 1990s, school bus manufacturers underwent a period of transition, with several ownership changes leading to joint ventures and alignments between body manufacturers and chassis suppliers.

In 1986, with the signing of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act, school bus drivers across the United States became required to acquire a commercial driver&#x27;s license (CDL). While CDLs were issued by individual states, the federal CDL requirement ensured that drivers of all large vehicles (such as school buses) had a consistent training level.

In contrast to the 1970s focus on structural integrity, design advances during the 1980s and 1990s focused around the driver. In 1979 and 1980, International Harvester and Ford each introduced a new-generation bus chassis, with General Motors following suit in 1984. To increase driver visibility, updates in line with chassis redesigns shifted the bus driver upward, outward, and forward. To decrease driver distraction, interior controls were redesigned with improved ergonomics; automatic transmissions came into wider use, preventing the risk of stalling (in hazardous places such as intersections or railroad crossings). Initially introduced during the late 1960s, crossview mirrors came into universal use, improving the view of the blind spots in front of the bus while loading or unloading. To supplement the rear emergency door in an evacuation, manufacturers introduced additional emergency exits during the 1980s, including roof-mounted escape hatches and outward-opening exit windows. Side-mounted exit doors (originally introduced on rear-engine buses), became offered on front-engine and conventional-body buses as a supplemental exit.

Alongside safety, body and chassis manufacturers sought to advance fuel economy of school buses. During the 1980s, diesel engines came into wide use in conventional and small school buses, gradually replacing gasoline-fueled engines. In 1987, International became the first chassis manufacturer to offer diesel engines exclusively, with Ford following suit in 1990.

While conventional-style buses remained the most widely produced full-size school bus, interest in forward visibility, higher seating capacity, and shorter turning radius led to a major expansion of market share of the transit-style configuration, coinciding with several design introductions in the late 1980s. Following the 1986 introduction of the Wayne Lifestar, the AmTran Genesis, Blue Bird TC/2000, and Thomas Saf-T-Liner MVP would prove far more successful.

During the 1990s, small school buses shifted further away from their van-conversion roots. In 1991, Girardin launched the MB-II, combining a single rear-wheel van chassis with a full cutaway bus body. Following the 1992 redesign of the Ford E-Series and the 1997 launch of Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana cutaway chassis, manufacturers followed suit, developing bodies to optimize loading-zone visibility. As manufacturers universally adopted cutaway bodies for single rear-wheel buses, the use of the Dodge Ram Van chassis was phased out. By 2005 the United States government banned the use of 15-passenger vans for student transport, leading to the introduction of Multi-Function School Activity Buses (MFSAB). To better protect passengers, MFSABs share the body structure and compartmentalized seating layout of school buses. Not intended (nor allowed) for uses requiring traffic priority, they are not fitted with school bus warning lights or stop arms (nor are they painted school bus yellow).

==== Manufacturer transitions ====
In 1980, school buses were manufactured by six body manufacturers (Blue Bird, Carpenter, Superior, Thomas, Ward, Wayne) and three chassis manufacturers (Ford, General Motors, and International Harvester); in California, two manufacturers (Crown and Gillig) manufactured transit-style school buses using proprietary chassis (sold primarily across the West Coast). From 1980 to 2001, all eight bus manufacturers would undergo periods of struggle and ownership changes. In 1980, Ward filed for bankruptcy, reorganizing as AmTran in 1981. The same year, Superior was liquidated by its parent company, closing its doors. Under its company management, Superior was split into two manufacturers, with Mid Bus introducing small buses in 1981 and a reorganized Superior producing full-size buses from 1982 to 1985. At the end of 1989, Carpenter would file for bankruptcy, emerging from it in 1990. In 1991, Crown Coach would close its doors forever; Gillig produced its last school bus in 1993. Following several ownership changes, Wayne Corporation was liquidated in 1992; successor Wayne Wheeled Vehicles was closed in 1995. In 2001, Carpenter closed its doors.

During the 1990s, as body manufacturers secured their future, family-owned businesses were replaced by subsidiaries as manufacturers underwent mergers, joint ventures, and acquisitions with major chassis suppliers. In 1991, Navistar began its acquisition of AmTran (fully acquiring it in 1995), phasing out the Ward brand name in 1993. In 1992, Blue Bird would change hands for the first of several times. In 1998, Carpenter was acquired by Spartan Motors and Thomas Built Buses was sold to Freightliner; the latter was the final major school bus manufacturer operating under family control.

Alongside the 1981 introduction of Mid Bus, Corbeil commenced production in Canada and the United States in 1985. Following the second (and final) closure of Superior in 1986, New Bus Company acquired the rights to its body design, producing buses from 1988 to 1989. In 1991, TAM-USA was a joint venture to produce the TAM 252 A 121. Assembled in Slovenia with final assembly in California, the TAM vehicle was to be the first American-market school bus imported from Europe.

In comparison to body manufacturers, chassis suppliers saw a smaller degree of transition. As International Harvester became Navistar International in 1986, the company released updated bus chassis for 1989; in 1996, it produced its first rear-engine bus chassis since 1973. In late 1996, Freightliner produced its first bus chassis, expanding to four manufacturers for the first time since the exit of Dodge in 1977. Ford and General Motors gradually exited out of cowled-chassis production with Ford producing its last chassis after 1998; General Motors exited the segment after 2003. Both Ford and GM continue production today, concentrating on cutaway-van chassis.

=== 2000–present ===
The beginning of the twenty-first century introduced extensive changes to the production of school buses. Though vehicle assembly saw few direct changes, manufacturer consolidation and industry contraction effectively ended the practice of customers selecting body and chassis manufacturers independently. While the aspect of customer choice was largely ended (as a result of corporate ownership and supply agreements), decreased complexity paved the way for new product innovations previously thought impossible. During the 2010s, while diesel engines have remained the primary source of power, manufacturers expanded the availability of alternative-fuel vehicles, including CNG, propane, gasoline, and electric-power buses.

At the beginning of the 2000s, manufacturers introduced a new generation of conventional-style school buses, coinciding with the redesign of several medium-duty truck lines. While Ford and General Motors shifted bus production to cutaway chassis, Freightliner and International released new cowled chassis in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In 2003, Blue Bird introduced the Vision conventional; in line with its transit-style buses, the Vision utilized a proprietary chassis (rather than a design from a medium-duty truck). In 2004, Thomas introduced the Saf-T-Liner C2 (derived from the Freightliner M2), with the body designed alongside its chassis (allowing the use of the production Freightliner dashboard). A trait of both the Vision and C2 (over their predecessors) is improved loading-zone visibility; both vehicles adopted highly sloped hoods and extra glass around the entry door. In 2005, IC introduced a redesigned CE-series to fit the International 3300 chassis; to improve visibility, the windshield was redesigned (eliminating the center post).

Between 2004 and 2008, Advanced Energy, an NC based non-profit created by the NC Utilities Commission begun an effort to move to plug-in hybrid school buses. A business and technical feasibility proved the benefits, and in 2006, 20 districts awarded a contract facilitated by Advanced Energy to IC Bus to produce the buses. Although the buses produced significant benefits, the buses were slowly discontinued when the hybrid system manufacture Enova faded into financial challenges.

In 2011, Lion Bus (renamed Lion Electric Company) of Saint-Jérôme, Quebec was founded, marking the first entry into the segment in over 20 years by a full-size bus manufacturer. Using a chassis supplied by Spartan Motors, Lion produces conventional-style school buses, its design features several firsts for school bus production. Along with a 102-inch body width, to resist corrosion, Lion uses composite body panels in place of steel. In 2015, Lion introduced the eLion, the first mass-produced school bus with a fully electric powertrain.

Small school buses have undergone few fundamental changes to their designs during the 2000s, though the Type B configuration has largely been retired from production. Following the 1998 sale of the General Motors P-chassis to Navistar subsidiary Workhorse, the design began to be phased out in favor of higher-capacity Type A buses. In 2006, IC introduced the BE200 as its first small school bus; a fully cowled Type B, the BE200 shared much of its body with the CE (on a lower-profile chassis). In 2010, IC introduced the AE-series, a cutaway-cab school bus (derived from the International TerraStar). In 2015, the Ford Transit cutaway chassis was introduced (alongside the long-running E350/450); initially sold with a Micro Bird body, the Transit has been offered through several manufacturers. In 2018, the first bus derived from the Ram ProMaster cutaway chassis was introduced; Collins Bus introduced the Collins Low Floor, the first low-floor school bus (of any configuration).

==== Manufacturing segment stability ====
Following the 2001 closure of Carpenter, the manufacturing segment has seen a much lower degree of contraction (with the exception of the 2005 failure of startup manufacturer Liberty Bus). Following the bankruptcy of Corbeil, the company was acquired at the end of 2007 by Collins, reorganizing it as a subsidiary (alongside Mid Bus) and shifting production to its Kansas facilities. The same year, U.S. Bus was reorganized as Trans Tech. In 2008, Starcraft Bus entered the segment, producing school buses on cutaway chassis (a 2011 prototype using a Hino chassis was never produced). In 2009, Blue Bird and Girardin entered into a joint venture, named Micro Bird; Girardin develops and produces the Blue Bird small-bus product line in Canada. The 2011 founding of Lion Bus marked the return of bus production to Canada (with the first Canadian-brand full-size buses sold in the United States). During the 2010s, Collins retired the Mid Bus and Corbeil brands (in 2013 and 2016, respectively).

==== Safety innovations ====
During the 2000s, school bus safety adopted a number of evolutionary advances. To further improve visibility for other drivers, manufacturers began to replace incandescent lights with LEDs for running lights, turn signals, brake lights, and warning lamps. School bus crossing arms, first introduced in the late 1990s, came into wider use. Electronics took on a new role in school bus operation. To increase child safety and security, alarm systems were developed to prevent children from being left on unattended school buses overnight. To track drivers who illegally pass school buses loading and unloading students, in the 2010s, some school buses began to adopt exterior cameras synchronized with the deployment of the exterior stop arms. Onboard GPS tracking devices have taken on a dual role of fleet management and location tracking, allowing for internal management of costs and also to alert waiting parents and students of the real-time location of their bus. Seatbelts in school buses underwent a redesign, with lap-type seatbelts phased out in favor of 3-point seatbelts.

== Design overview ==

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), school buses are the safest type of road vehicle. Between 2013 and 2022, there were 976 fatal school bus accidents, resulting in 1,082 deaths and approximately 132,000 injuries. On average, five fatalities involve school-age children on a school bus each year; statistically, a school bus is over 70 times safer than riding to school by car. Many fatalities related to school buses are passengers of other vehicles and pedestrians (only 5% are bus occupants). Since the initial development of consistent school bus standards in 1939, many of the ensuing changes to school buses over the past eight decades have been safety related, particularly in response to more stringent regulations adopted by state and federal governments.

Ever since the adoption of yellow as a standard color in 1939, school buses deliberately integrate the concept of into their design. When making student dropoffs or pickups, traffic law gives school buses priority over other vehicles; in order to stop traffic, they are equipped with flashing lights and a stop sign.

As a consequence of their size, school buses have a number of blind spots around the outside of the vehicle which can endanger passengers disembarking a bus or pedestrians standing or walking nearby. To address this safety challenge, a key point of school bus design is focused on exterior visibility, improving the design of bus windows, mirrors, and the windshield to optimize visibility for the driver. In the case of a collision, the body structure of a school bus is designed with an integral roll cage; as a school bus carries a large number of student passengers, a school bus is designed with several emergency exits to facilitate fast egress.

In the United States and Canada, numerous federal and state regulations require school buses to be manufactured as a purpose-built vehicle distinct from other buses. In contrast to buses in use for public transit, dedicated school buses used for student transport are all single-deck, two-axle design (multi-axle designs are no longer in use). Outside of North America, buses utilized for student transport are derived from vehicles used elsewhere in transit systems, including coaches, minibuses, and transit buses.

=== Types ===

There are four types of school buses produced by manufacturers in North America. The smallest school buses are designated Type A (short bus); a larger format (bodied on bare front-engine chassis) are designated Type B buses. Large school buses include Type C (bodied on cowled medium-duty truck chassis) and Type D (bodied on bare &quot;forward control&quot; or &quot;pusher&quot; chassis). Type C buses are the most common design, while Type D buses are the largest vehicles.

All school buses are of single deck design with step entry. In the United States and Canada, bus bodies are restricted to a maximum width of and a maximum length of . Seating capacity is affected by both body length and operator specifications, with the largest designs seating up to 90 passengers.

====Other formats====
In both public and private education systems, other types of school buses are used for purposes of student transport outside of regular route service. Along with their usage, these buses are distinguished from regular yellow school buses by their exterior design.

An &quot;activity bus&quot; is a school bus used for providing transportation for students. In place of home to school route service, an activity bus is primarily used for the purpose for transportation related to extracurricular activities. Depending on individual state/provincial regulations, the bus used for this purpose can either be a regular yellow school bus or a dedicated unit for this purpose. Dedicated activity buses, while not painted yellow, are fitted with the similar interiors as well as the same traffic control devices for dropping off students (at other schools); conversely, it cannot be used in regular route service.

A Multi-Function School Activity Bus (MFSAB) is a bus intended for use in both the private sector and the educational system. While sharing a body structure with a school bus, an MFSAB is not designed for use in route service, as it is not fitted with traffic control devices (i.e., red warning lights, stop arm) nor is it painted school bus yellow. Within the educational system, the design is primarily used for extracurricular activities requiring bus transportation; in the private sector, the MFSAB is intended as a replacement for 15-passenger vans (no longer legal for child transport in either the public or private sector). Many examples are derived from Type A buses (with derivatives of full-size school buses also offered).

=== Features ===
==== Livery ====
To specifically identify them as such, purpose-built school buses are painted a specific shade of yellow, designed to optimize their visibility for other drivers. In addition to &quot;School Bus&quot; signage in the front and rear above the window line, school buses are labeled with the name of the operator (school district or bus contractor) and an identification number.

===== Yellow color =====

Yellow was adopted as the standard color for North American school buses in 1939. In April of that year, rural education specialist Frank W. Cyr organized a national conference at Columbia University to establish production standards for school buses, including a standard exterior color. The color which became known as &quot;school bus yellow&quot; was selected because black lettering on that specific hue was easiest to see in the semi-darkness of early morning and late afternoon. Officially, school bus yellow was designated &quot;National School Bus Chrome&quot;; following the removal of lead from the pigment, it was renamed &quot;National School Bus Glossy Yellow&quot;.

Outside the United States and Canada, the association of yellow with school buses has led to its use on school-use buses around the world (although not necessarily required by government specification). Some areas establishing school transport services have conducted evaluations of American yellow-style school buses; to better suit local climate conditions, other governments have established their own color requirements, favoring other high-visibility colors (such as white or orange). 

===== Retroreflective markings =====
While its yellow exterior makes it more conspicuous than other vehicles, a school bus can remain hard to see in some low-visibility conditions, including sunrise or sunset, poor weather (all seasons), and in rural areas. To further improve their visibility (to other vehicles), many state and provincial governments (for example, Colorado) require the use of yellow reflective tape on school buses. Marking the length, width, height, and in some cases, identifying the bus as a school bus, reflective tape makes the vehicle easier to see in low light, also marking all emergency exits (so rescue personnel can quickly find them in darkness). Other requirements include reflective &quot;School Bus&quot; lettering (or the use of a front-lighted sign).

The equivalent requirement in Canada is almost identical; the only difference is that red cannot be used as a retroreflective color.

==== Safety devices ====
To comply with federal and state requirements, school buses are equipped with a number of safety devices to prevent accidents and injuries and for the purposes of security.

===== Mirror systems =====

When driving and when loading/unloading students, a key priority for a school bus driver is maintaining proper sightlines around their vehicle; the blind spots formed by the school bus can be a significant risk to bus drivers and traffic as well as pedestrians.

In the United States, approximately of students killed outside of the school bus are not struck by other vehicles, but by their own bus. To combat this problem, school buses are specified with sophisticated and comprehensive mirror systems. In redesigns of school bus bodies, driver visibility and overall sightlines have become important considerations. In comparison to school buses from the 1980s, school buses from the 2000s have much larger windscreens and fewer and/or smaller blind spots.

=====Emergency exits=====
For the purposes of evacuation, school buses are equipped with a minimum of at least one emergency exit (in addition to the main entry door). The rear-mounted emergency exit door is a design feature adopted from horse-drawn wagons (the entrance was rear-mounted to avoid disturbing the horses); in rear-engine school buses, the door is replaced by an exit window mounted above the engine compartment (supplemented by a side-mounted exit door). Additional exits may be located in the roof (roof hatches), window exits, and/or side emergency exit doors. All are opened by the use of quick-release latches which activate an alarm.

The number of emergency exits in a school bus is dependent on its seating capacity and also varies by individual state/provincial requirements. The most currently installed is eight on school buses in Kentucky. Buses that are owned or used by Kentucky school districts require, in addition to the main entry door, a rear exit door (or window, for rear-engine buses), a left-side exit door, four exit windows (two on each side), and two roof-mounted exit hatches. The current Kentucky standards were enacted after 27 people died in the Carrolton bus collision on May 14, 1988, in which a former school bus that was converted into a church bus was hit head on by a drunk driver.

=====Video surveillance=====
Since the 1990s, video cameras have become common equipment installed inside school buses. As recording technology has transitioned from VHS to digital cameras, school buses have adopted multiple-camera systems, providing surveillance from multiple vantage points.

While primarily used to monitor and record passenger behavior, video cameras have also been used in the investigation of accidents involving school buses. On March 28, 2000, a Murray County, Georgia, school bus was hit by a CSX freight train at an unsignaled railroad crossing; three children were killed. The bus driver claimed to have stopped and looked for approaching trains before proceeding across the tracks, as is required by law, but the onboard camera recorded that the bus had in fact not stopped and had the AM/FM radio playing.

In the 2010s, exterior-mounted cameras synchronized with the stop arms have come into use. The cameras photograph vehicles that illegally pass the bus when its stop arm and warning lights are in use (a moving violation).

====Restraint systems====
In contrast to cars and other light-duty passenger vehicles, school buses are not typically equipped with active restraint systems, such as seat belts; whether seat belts should be a requirement has been a topic of controversy. Since the 1970s, school buses have used the concept of compartmentalization as a passive restraint system during the late 2000s and 2010s, seatbelt design transitioned, with 3-point restraints replacing lap belts.

As of 2015, seatbelts are a requirement in at least five states: California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Texas; Canada does not require their installation (at the provincial level). Of the states that equip buses with two-point lap seat belts (Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey and New York), only New Jersey requires seat belt usage by riders. In other states, it is up to the district or operator whether to require riders to use them or not.

===== Passive restraints (compartmentalization) =====
According to the National Highway Transportation Association (NHTSA), studies completed previously on school buses showed that due to their size and heaviness, school buses did not require that safety belts be in place. Information gathered in previous studies showed that a size of a bus, combined with the design of the seat and the material in the space between the seats themselves, showed that there was no need for safety belts on a school bus. A bus is larger and heavier than a normal size passenger vehicle and could distribute the force of the crash evenly. Combined with the space between the seats as well as the design prevented serious injuries from happening. This attribute, does not carry over to a small bus due to its lesser size; buses with a GVWR under 10,000 pounds are required to have safety belts.

However, recent accidents involving school buses that have caused serious (if not fatal) injuries have caused the National Transportation Safety Board to conduct new tests to check the legitimacy of this continued practice. After completing these tests due to bus accidents in 2016, they have recommended that new buses being built need to have both a lap and shoulder harness in place. They have also recommended that 42 states add seat belts as a requirement. There are some states that have already added the lap belt. This study made the NTSB recommend adding shoulder harnesses to those states that already have a lap belt in place.

In 1967 and 1972, as part of an effort to improve crash protection in school buses, UCLA researchers played a role in the future of school bus interior design. Using the metal-backed seats then in use as a means of comparison, several new seat designs were researched in crash testing. In its conclusion, the UCLA researchers found that the safest design was a 28-inch high padded seatback spaced a maximum of 24 inches apart, using the concept of compartmentalization as a passive restraint. While the UCLA researchers found the compartmentalized seats to be the safest design, they found active restraints (such as seatbelts) to be next in terms of importance of passenger safety. In 1977, FMVSS 222 mandated a change to compartmentalized seats, though the height requirement was lowered to 24 inches. According to the NTSB, the main disadvantage of passive-restraint seats is its lack of protection in side-impact collisions (with larger vehicles) and rollover situations. Though by design, students are protected front to back by compartmentalization, it allows the potential for ejection in other crash situations (however rare).

===== Active restraints (seatbelts) =====
&quot;Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 222&quot; was introduced in 1977, requiring passive restraints and more stringent structural integrity standards; as part of the legislation, seatbelts were exempted from school buses with a gross vehicle weight (GVWR) exceeding 10,000 pounds.

In 1987, New York became the first state to require seatbelts on full-size school buses (raising the seat height to 28 inches); the requirement did not mandate their use. In 1992, New Jersey followed suit, becoming the first state to require their use, remaining the only state to do so. Outside of North America, Great Britain mandated seatbelts in 1995 for minibuses used in student transportation. In 2004, California became the first state to require 3-point seatbelts (on small buses; large buses, 2005), with Texas becoming the second in 2010.

In 2011, FMVSS 222 was revised to improve occupant protection in small (Type A) school buses. Along with requiring 3-point restraints (in place of lap belts), the revision created design standards for their use in full-size school buses. While previously reducing seating capacity by up to one-third, NHTSA recognized new technology that allows using seatbelts for either three small (elementary-age) children or two larger children (high-school age) per seat. In October 2013, the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services (NASDPTS) most recently stated at their annual transportation conference (NAPT) that they now fully support three-point lap-shoulder seat belts on school buses.

CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; has been critical of a 1984 Transport Canada study, a crash test of a school bus colliding head-on that suggested that seat belts (at the time, which were two-point lap belts) would interfere with the compartmentalization passive safety system. This had become &quot;the most widely cited study&quot; in North America, according to U.S. regulators, and was frequently quoted for decades by school boards and bus manufacturers across the continent as a reason not to install seat belts. Transport Canada has stuck to its stance against installing seat belts on school buses, despite numerous newer studies and actual accidents showing that compartmentalization could not protect against side impacts, rollovers, and being rear-ended; which would have been avoided by implementing three-point seat belts that would have kept occupants from being thrown from their seats.

== Manufacturing ==
In 2018, 44,381 school buses were sold in North America (compared to 31,194 in 2010). Approximately 70% of production is of Type C configuration.

===Production (North America)===

In the United States and Canada, school buses are currently produced by nine different manufacturers. Four of them—Collins Industries, Starcraft Bus, Trans Tech, and Van Con — specialize exclusively in small buses. Thomas Built Buses and Blue Bird Corporation (the latter, through its Micro Bird joint venture with Girardin)—produce both small and large buses. IC Bus and Lion Electric produce full-size buses exclusively.

During the 20th century, Canada was home to satellite facilities of several U.S. firms (Blue Bird, Thomas, Wayne), exporting production across North America, with other production imported from the United States. Domestically, Corbeil manufactured full-size and small school buses (1985–2007) and Girardin produced small buses. In 2011, Lion Bus (today, Lion Electric Company/La Compagnie Électrique Lion) was founded as a Quebec-based manufacturer of full-size buses, shifting development to fully-electric vehicles.

== Operations ==
Every year in the United States and Canada, school buses provide an estimated 8 billion student trips from home and school. Each school day in 2015, nearly 484,000 school buses transported 26.9 million children to and from school and school-related activities; over half of the United States K–12 student population is transported by school bus. Outside North America, purpose-built vehicles for student transport are less common. Depending on location, students ride to school on transit buses (on school-only routes), coaches, or a variety of other buses.

While school bus operations vary widely by location, in the United States and Canada, school bus services operate independent of public transport, with their own bus stops and schedules, coordinated with school class times.

=== Licensing ===
School bus drivers in the United States are required to hold a commercial driver&#x27;s license (CDL). Full-size school buses are generally considered Class B vehicles; most van-based school buses are considered Class C vehicles. In addition to a standard P (passenger) endorsement, school bus drivers must acquire a separate S (school bus) endorsement; along with a written and driving test, the endorsement requires a background check and sex offender registry check.

===Loading and unloading===

Coinciding with their seating configuration, school buses have a higher seating capacity than buses of a similar length; a typical full-size school bus can carry from 66 to 90 . In contrast to a transit bus, school buses are equipped with a single entry door at the front of the bus. Several configurations of entry doors are used on school buses, including center-hinged (jack-knife) and outward-opening. Prior to the 2000s, doors operated manually by the driver were the most common, with air or electric-assist becoming nearly universal in current vehicles.

School bus routes are designed with multiple bus stops, allowing for the loading (unloading) of several students at a time; the stop at school is the only time that the bus loads (unloads) passengers at once.

To inhibit pedestrians from walking into the blind spot created by the hood (or lower bodywork, on Type D buses), crossing arms are safety devices that extend outward from the front bumper when the bus door is open for loading or unloading. By design, these force passengers ()and other pedestrians) to walk forward several feet forward of the bus (into the view of the driver) before they can cross the road in front of the bus.

In the past, handrails in the entry way posed a potential risk for to students; as passengers exited a bus, items such as drawstrings or other loose clothing could be caught if the driver was unaware and pulled away with the student caught in the door. To minimize this risk, school bus manufacturers have redesigned handrails and equipment in the stepwell area. In its &quot;School Bus Handrail Handbook&quot;, the NHTSA described a simple test procedure for identifying unsafe stepwell handrails.

====Traffic priority====

When loading and unloading students, school buses have the ability to stop traffic, using a system of warning lights and stop arms-a stop sign that is deployed from the bus to stop traffic when the door is opened.

By the mid-1940s, most US states introduced traffic laws requiring motorists to stop for school buses while children were loading or unloading. The justifications for this protocol were:

* Children (especially younger ones) have normally not yet developed the mental capacity to fully comprehend the hazards and consequences of street-crossing, and under US tort laws, a child cannot legally be held accountable for negligence. For the same reason, adult crossing guards often are deployed in walking zones between homes and schools.
* It is impractical in many cases to avoid children crossing the traveled portions of roadways after leaving a school bus or to have an adult accompany them.
* The size of a school bus generally limits visibility for both the children and motorists during loading and unloading.

Since at least the mid-1970s, all US states and Canadian provinces and territories have some sort of school bus traffic stop law; although each jurisdiction requires traffic to stop for a school bus loading and unloading passengers, different jurisdictions have different requirements of when to stop. Outside North America, the school bus stopping traffic to unload and load children is not provided for. Instead of being given traffic priority, fellow drivers are encouraged to drive with extra caution around school buses.

====Warning lights and stop arms====

Around 1946, the first system of traffic warning signal lights on school buses was used in Virginia, consisting of a pair of sealed beam lights. Instead of colorless glass lenses (similar to car headlamps), the warning lamps utilized red lenses. A motorized rotary switch applied power alternately to the red lights mounted at the left and right of the front and rear of the bus, creating a wig-wag effect. Activation was typically through a mechanical switch attached to the door control. However, on some buses (such as Gillig&#x27;s Transit Coach models and the Kenworth-Pacific School Coach) activation of the roof warning lamp system was through the use of a pressure-sensitive switch on a manually controlled stop paddle lever located to the left of the driver&#x27;s seat below the window. Whenever the pressure was relieved by extending the stop paddle, the electric current was activated to the relay. In the 1950s, plastic lenses were developed for the warning lenses, though the warning lights (with colorless glass lenses) used sealed-beam lamps into the mid-2000s, when light-emitting diodes (LEDs) came into use.

The warning lamps initially used for school buses consisted of four red warning lights. With the adoption of FMVSS 108 in January 1968, four additional lights, termed &quot;advance&quot; warning lights&quot;,&quot; were gradually added to school buses; these were amber in color and mounted inboard of the red warning lights. Intended to signal an upcoming stop to drivers, as the entry door was opened at the stop, they were wired to be overridden by the red lights and the stop sign. Although red &amp; amber systems were adopted by many states and provinces during the 1970s and 1980s, the all-red systems remain in use by some locales such as Saskatchewan and Ontario, Canada, older buses from California, as well as on buses built in Wisconsin before 2005.

The Ontario School Bus Association has challenged the effectiveness of Ontario&#x27;s all-red 8-light warning system, citing that the use of red for both &quot;advance&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; warning signals is subject to driver misinterpretation. The Association claims that many motorists only have a vague understanding of Ontario&#x27;s school bus stopping laws and that few drivers know that it is legal to pass a school bus with its inner (advance) warning lights actuated. Transport Canada&#x27;s Transport Development Centre compared the effectiveness of the all-red system to the amber-red system and found that drivers are 21% more likely to safely pass a school bus when presented with amber advance signals instead of red signals. Transport Canada states that amber advance signals are proven to be slightly superior to red signals and recommends that all-red warning signals be replaced by the eight-lamp system in the shortest period possible. After the issue had received media attention, a petition has been signed to make the switch from the all-red to amber advance lights on Ontario school busses. The Ministry of Ontario of Transportation (MTO) has not yet provided any plan or timeline for the change.

To aid visibility of the bus in inclement weather, school districts and school bus operators add flashing strobe lights to the roof of the bus. Some states (for example, Illinois) require strobe lights as part of their local specifications.

During the early 1950s, states began to specify a mechanical stop signal arm which the driver would deploy from the left side of the bus to warn traffic of a stop in progress. The portion of the stop arm protruding in front of traffic was initially a trapezoidal shape with painted on it. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 131 regulates the specifications of the stop arm as a double-faced regulation octagonal red stop sign at least across, with white border and uppercase legend. It must be retroreflective and/or equipped with alternately flashing red lights. As an alternative, the legend itself may also flash; this is commonly achieved with red LEDs. FMVSS 131 stipulates that the stop signal arm be installed on the left side of the bus, and placed so that when it is extended, the arm is perpendicular to the side of the bus, with the top edge of the sign parallel to and within of a horizontal plane tangent to the bottom edge of the first passenger window frame behind the driver&#x27;s window, and that the vertical center of the stop signal arm must be no more than from the side of the bus. One stop signal arm is required; a second may also be installed. The second stop arm, when it is present, is usually mounted near the rear of the bus, and is not permitted to bear a or any other legend on the side facing forward when deployed.

The Canadian standard, defined in Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 131, is substantially identical to the U.S. standard. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, the use of stop signal arms is banned under traffic bylaws in multiple cities, citing that they provide a false sense of safety to students by encouraging jaywalking in front of the bus rather than safely crossing at an intersection. These bans have been the subject of public debate in cities such as Regina and Prince Albert.

==Environmental impact==
As the use of school buses transports students on a much larger scale than by car (on average, the same as 36 separate automobiles), their use reduces pollution in the same manner as carpooling. Through their usage of internal-combustion engines, school buses are not an emissions-free form of transportation (in comparison to biking or walking). As of 2017, over 95% of school buses in North America are powered by diesel-fueled engines.

While diesel offers fuel efficiency and safety advantages over gasoline, diesel exhaust fumes have become a concern (related to health problems). Since the early to mid-2000s, emissions standards for diesel engines have been upgraded considerably; a school bus meeting 2017 emissions standards is 60 times cleaner than a school bus from 2002 (and approximately 3,600 times cleaner than a counterpart from 1990). To comply with upgraded standards and regulations, diesel engines have been redesigned to use ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel with selective catalytic reduction becoming a primary emissions control strategy.

===Alternative fuels===

Although diesel fuel is most commonly used in large school buses (and even in many smaller ones), alternative fuel systems such as LPG/propane and CNG have been developed to counter the emissions drawbacks that diesel and gasoline-fueled school buses pose to the public health and environment.

The use of propane as a fuel for school buses began in the 1970s, largely as a response to the 1970s energy crisis. Initially produced as conversions of gasoline engines (as both require spark ignition), propane fell out of favor in the 1980s as fuel prices stabilized, coupled with the expanded use of diesel engines. In the late 2000s, propane-fueled powertrains reentered production as emissions regulations began to negatively affect the performance of diesel engines. In 2009, Blue Bird Corporation introduced a version of the Blue Bird Vision powered by a LPG-fuel engine. As of 2018, three manufacturers offer a propane-fuel full-size school bus (Blue Bird, IC, and Thomas), along with Ford and General Motors Type A chassis.

Compressed natural gas was first introduced for school buses in the early 1990s (with Blue Bird building its first CNG bus in 1991 and Thomas building its first in 1993). As of 2018, CNG is offered by two full-size bus manufacturers (Blue Bird, Thomas) along with Ford and General Motors Type A chassis.

In a reversal from the 1990s, gasoline-fuel engines made a return to full-size school buses during the 2010s, with Blue Bird introducing a gasoline-fuel Vision for 2016. As of current production, Blue Bird and IC offer gasoline-fuel full-size buses; gasoline engines are standard equipment in Ford and General Motors Type A chassis. As an alternative, gasoline-fuel engines offer simpler emissions equipment (over diesel engines) and a widely available fuel infrastructure (a drawback of LPG/CNG vehicles). 

=== Electric school buses ===

In theory, urban and suburban routes prove advantageous for the use of an electric bus; charging can be achieved before and after the bus is transporting students (when the bus is parked). In the early 1990s, several prototype models of battery-powered buses were developed as conversions of existing school buses; these were built primarily for research purposes.

During the 2000s, school bus electrification shifted towards the development of diesel-electric hybrid school buses. Intended as a means to minimize engine idling while loading/unloading passengers and increasing diesel fuel economy, hybrid school buses failed to gain widespread acceptance. A key factor in their market failure was their high price (nearly twice the price of a standard diesel school bus) and hybrid system complexity.

In the 2010s, school bus electrification shifted from hybrids to fully electric vehicles, with several vehicles entering production. Trans Tech introduced the 2011 eTrans prototype (based on the Smith Electric Newton cabover truck), later producing the 2014 SSTe, a derivative of the Ford E-450. The first full-size electric school bus was the Lion Bus eLion, introduced in 2015; as of 2018, over 150 examples have been produced.

During 2017 and 2018, several body manufacturers introduced prototypes of electric school buses, with electric versions of the Blue Bird All American, Blue Bird Vision, Micro Bird G5 (on Ford E450 chassis), IC CE-Series, and the Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2 previewing production vehicles. During 2018, Blue Bird, Thomas, and IC introduced prototypes of full-size school buses intended for production; Blue Bird intends to offer electric-power versions of its entire product line.

===Walking and cycling &#x27;buses&#x27;===

Walking buses and bike bus (known as &quot;riding school bus&quot; for students) take their names and some of the principle of public transport in a group to travel to school for students under adult supervision.

== Other uses ==
Outside of student transport itself, the design of a school bus is adapted for use for a variety of applications. Along with newly produced vehicles, conversions of retired school buses see a large range of uses. Qualities desired from school buses involve sturdy construction (as school buses have an all-steel body and frame), a large seating capacity, and wheelchair lift capability, among others.

=== School bus derivatives ===
==== Church use ====

Churches throughout the United States use buses to transport their congregants, both to church services and events. A wide variety of buses are owned by churches, depending on needs and affordability. Larger buses may often be derived from school buses (newly purchased or second-hand). Other churches often own minibuses, often equipped with wheelchair lifts. When school bus derivatives are used, church bus livery is dictated by federal regulations, which require the removal of &quot;School Bus&quot; lettering and the disabling/removal of stop arms/warning lights. In some states, School Bus Yellow must be painted over entirely.

In church use, transporting adults and/or children, traffic law does not give church buses traffic priority in most states (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia being the only states where a church bus can stop traffic with flashing red lights).

====Community outreach====
In terms of vehicles used for community outreach, school bus bodyshells (both new and second-hand) see use as bookmobiles and mobile blood donation centers (bloodmobiles), among other uses. Both types of vehicles spend long periods of time parked in the same place; to reduce fuel consumption, they often power interior equipment and climate control with an on-board generator in place of the chassis engine.

Bookmobiles feature interior shelving for books and library equipment; bloodmobiles feature mobile phlebotomy stations and blood storage

====Inmate transport buses====

Larger police agencies may own police buses derived from school bus bodies for a number of purposes. Along with buses with high-capacity seating serving as officer transports (in large-scale deployments), other vehicles derived from buses may have little seating, serving as temporary mobile command centers; these vehicles are built from school bus bodyshells and fitted with agency-specified equipment.

Prisoner transport vehicles are high-security vehicles used to transport prisoners; a school bus bodyshell is fitted with a specially designed interior and exterior with secure windows and doors.

=== Uses of retired school buses ===
As of 2016, the average age of a school bus in the United States is 9.3 years. School buses can be retired from service due to a number of factors, including vehicle age or mileage, mechanical condition, emissions compliance, or any combination of these factors. In some states and provinces, school bus retirement is called for at specific age or mileage intervals, regardless of mechanical condition. In recent years, budget concerns in many publicly funded school districts have necessitated that school buses be kept in service longer.

When a school bus is retired from school use, it can see a wide variety of usage. While a majority are scrapped for parts and recycling (a requirement in some states), better-running examples are put up for sale as surplus vehicles. Second-hand school buses are sold to such entities as churches, resorts or summer camps; others are exported to Central America, South America, or elsewhere. Other examples of retired school buses are preserved and restored by collectors and bus enthusiasts; collectors and museums have an interest in older and rarer models. Additionally, restored school buses appear alongside other period vehicles in television and film.

When a school bus is sold for usage outside of student transport, NHTSA regulations require that its identification as a school bus be removed. To do so, all school bus lettering must be removed or covered while the exterior must be painted a color different than school bus yellow; the stop arm(s) and warning lamps must be removed or disabled.

====School bus conversions====
In retirement, not all school buses live on as transport vehicles. In contrast, the purchasers of school buses use the large body and chassis to use as either a working vehicle, or as a basis to build a rolling home. To build a utility vehicle for farms, owners often remove much of the roof and sides, creating a large flatbed or open-bed truck for hauling hay. Other farms use unconverted, re-painted, school buses to transport their workforce.

Skoolies are retired school buses converted into recreational vehicles (the term also applies to their owners and enthusiasts). Constructed and customized by their owners; while some examples have primitive accommodations, others rival the features of production RVs. Exteriors vary widely, including only the removal of school bus lettering, conservative designs, or the bus equivalent of an art car. An example of a Skoolie is Further, a 1939 (and later, 1947) school bus converted by Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, intended for use on cross-country counterculture road trips. Both versions of Further are painted with a variety of psychedelic colors and designs. 

===School bus export===
Retired school buses from Canada and the United States are sometimes exported to Africa, Central America, South America, or elsewhere. Used as public transportation between communities, these buses are nicknamed &quot;chicken buses&quot; for both their crowded accommodation and the (occasional) transportation of livestock alongside passengers. To attract passengers (and fares), yellow buses are often repainted with flamboyant exterior color schemes and modified with chrome exterior trim.

==Around the world==
Outside the United States and Canada, the usage and design of buses for student transport varies worldwide. In Europe, Asia, and Australia, buses utilized for student transport may be derived from standard transit buses. Alongside differences in body, chassis, engines, and seating design, school buses outside North America differ primarily in their signage, livery, and traffic priority.

<text>The 74th Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), took place on March 24, 2002, at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories honoring films released in 2001. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Laura Ziskin and directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actress Whoopi Goldberg hosted the show for the fourth time. She first hosted the 66th ceremony held in 1994 and had last hosted the 71st ceremony in 1999. Three weeks earlier, in a ceremony held at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on March 2, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Charlize Theron.

&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; won four awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; with four awards, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; with two, and &quot;The Accountant&quot;, &quot;For the Birds&quot;, &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Murder on a Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;Shrek&quot;, &quot;Thoth&quot;, and &quot;Training Day&quot; with one. Despite a record length of four hours and twenty-three minutes, the telecast garnered nearly 42 million viewers in the United States.

==Winners and nominees==
The nominees for the 74th Academy Awards were announced on February 12, 2002, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Frank Pierson, president of the academy, and the actress Marcia Gay Harden. &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; earned the most nominations with thirteen. It was the seventh film to earn that many nominations. &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; tied for second place with eight apiece.

The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 24, 2002. By virtue of its latest Best Picture victory for &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, DreamWorks became the second film studio to release three consecutive Best Picture winners; the studio had previously released &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Denzel Washington was the second African-American to win the Academy Award for Best Actor, following Sidney Poitier for 1963&#x27;s &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;. Halle Berry became the first, and , only, African-American to win the Academy Award for Best Actress. Nominated for their performances as the title character in &quot;Iris&quot;, Best Actress nominee Judi Dench and Best Supporting Actress nominee Kate Winslet became the second pair of actresses nominated for portraying the same character in the same film, following Best Actress nominee Winslet and Best Supporting Actress nominee Gloria Stuart as Rose in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Ceremony information==
The academy wanted to find a new venue for the festivities amid limited seating and rehearsal time concerns with the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. In addition, problems arose regarding staging the Oscars at the Shrine Auditorium because there was difficulty of directing guests from the auditorium where the main event took place to the adjacent Exhibition Hall for the Governor&#x27;s Ball. In August 1997, AMPAS and Canadian development firm TrizecHahn went into negotiations over the development of an entertainment complex located on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue adjacent to the Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. Seven months later, both the academy and TrizecHahn agreed on a twenty-year lease that allowed for the ceremony to be staged at a new venue, which would later be called the Kodak Theatre, located within the property which was also situated near the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel site of the inaugural awards ceremony in 1929. This was the first time the ceremony was held in Hollywood since the 32nd ceremony took place at the Pantages Theatre in 1960.

In view of the return of the Oscars to Hollywood, the academy hired film producer and Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Laura Ziskin in September 2001 to oversee production of the telecast. Pierson explained the decision to hire Ziskin saying, &quot;This show is one of the most difficult—if not the most difficult—producing jobs in show business. Laura Ziskin brings intelligence, experience and wit expressed in everything she has done.&quot; This marked the first occurrence that a woman produced the Oscars solo. Four months later, Whoopi Goldberg was selected as host of the 2002 ceremony. In an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Ziskin justified her choice of Goldberg commenting that she has &quot;great warmth, with humor, humanity and social conscience, all qualities that I feel are essential for this year&#x27;s show. I look forward to collaborating with Whoopi to put on a meaningful and entertaining evening.&quot;

Furthermore, the September 11 attacks affected the telecast and its surrounding events. Despite speculation and suggestions that the festivities be postponed or canceled, AMPAS President Pierson wrote in a &quot;Variety&quot; column refusing to take such action stating that it would send the message that &quot;the terrorists have won&quot;. However, due to security concerns the academy announced that red carpet bleacher seats would now be limited on a reservation basis based on a random selection and a background check.

On Oscar night, Tom Cruise opened the show and stated that it was the job of filmmakers to make films during troubling times. In addition, later in the evening Goldberg introduced a &quot;New York icon&quot; to the stage and filmmaker and director Woody Allen, who had previously refused to attend a ceremony, made a surprise appearance. He was greeted with a hearty standing ovation from audience members including Baz Luhrmann, Ron Howard, Jennifer Connelly, Washington, and Ethan Hawke. He explained after the events that happened that September he was there to represent the city he so loved and to plead filmmakers to continue to film in New York City. Woody then presented a film montage created by fellow New Yorker and screenwriter Nora Ephron saluting New York City in film.

Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Actors Glenn Close and Donald Sutherland served as announcers during the show. The orchestra led by film composer and telecast musical supervisor John Williams, performed selections of film scores during a montage saluting film composers produced by Kyle Cooper. Filmmaker Errol Morris filmed a vignette featuring several famous people discuss movie memories. Director Penelope Spheeris produced a montage saluting 60 years of Oscar-winning documentary feature films. Cirque du Soleil performed a dance number inspired by movies and visual effects.

===Introduction of Best Animated Feature award===
Beginning with this ceremony, AMPAS introduced a new competitive award that would honor animated feature films. According to Academy communications director John Pavlik, the film must be at least 70 minutes in length, have a significant amount of animated characters, and be at least 75 percent animated in order to be qualified for consideration. A minimum of eight qualifying films must be released within the calendar year to permit a slate of three nominees. If the number of films exceeds twelve, the nominee roster increases to five. Prior to the introduction of this category, three Disney films (1937&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, and 1995&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot;) were all given Special Achievement Academy Awards.

===Box office performance of nominated films===
At the time of the nominations announcement on February 12, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $484 million, with an average of $96.9 million per film. &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $271 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; ($113 million), &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; ($57.1 million), &quot;Gosford Park&quot; ($22.2 million), and finally &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; ($19.5 million).

Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 46 nominations went to 14 films on the list. Only &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2nd), &quot;Shrek&quot; (3rd), &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (4th), &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; (15th), &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (25th), &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; (27th), &quot;Training Day&quot; (29th), &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (31st), &quot;Ali&quot; (41st), and &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (44th) were nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature, or any of the directing, acting, or screenwriting awards. The other top-50 box office hits that earned nominations were &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1st), &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (7th), &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (19th), and &quot;AI: Artificial Intelligence&quot; (28th).

===Critical reviews===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Television critic Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; complained that the awards ceremony was &quot;intensely narcissistic and characteristically, almost unrelievedly, dull.&quot; Columnist Matthew Gilbert of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; bemoaned that &quot;TV&#x27;s most-watched slug crawled back into town last night.&quot; He also sniped, &quot;As usual, the technical awards formed a Bermuda Triangle in the middle of the show, and the film-clip fests and production numbers numbed our brains.&quot; &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;&#x27;s Rick Kishman lamented that &quot;It was the first time both best-acting Oscars went to African Americans...yet viewers had to fight hours and hours of boredom to care.&quot; He also quipped that the excessive amount of montage and tributes dragged down the proceedings.

Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. &quot;Orange County Register&quot; film critic Henry Sheehan praised Goldberg&#x27;s performance as hosting writing that her &quot;ensuing entrance a la &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was a comparative triumph and her boom-boom-boom succession of jokes put the show right on track.&quot; Television columnist Joanne Ostrow of &quot;The Denver Post&quot; raved, &quot;The nearly five-hour telecast was stunning, historic, slick, efficient, and helped along by some knockout clothes.&quot; She also commented that Washington and Berry&#x27;s acceptance speeches and the Sidney Poitier tribute added to the historic and emotional mood of the festivities. John Levesque of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; commended producer Ziskin for producing &quot;the best Oscar telecast this TV watcher can remember.&quot; In addition, he wrote that &quot;It was clear the 74th Academy Awards ceremony was something special: fresh, crisp, different from its predecessors.&quot;

===Ratings and reception===
At four hours and 23 minutes, the ceremony was the longest in history. The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 41.82 million people over its length, which was a 3% decrease from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony. The show also earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 25.54% of households watching over a 40.34 share. In addition, it garnered a lower 1849 demo rating with a 16.13 rating over a 36.46 share among viewers in that demographic.

In July 2002, the ceremony presentation received seven nominations at the 54th Primetime Emmys. Two months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Debra Brown&#x27;s choreography during the telecast.

<doc id="633078" wikidata="Q2487555" url="?curid=633078" title="El Barzón">
<text>El Barzón is a movement of middle class private business and farming interests in Mexico.

A &quot;Barzón&quot;, in terms of agriculture, is the yoke-ring to which a rope or chain is attached to pull a farm plow; a hitch-ring, connecting-ring, a pull-ring. The name comes from a Mexican revolutionary song that speaks about injustice in the fields of the countryside. Their motto is: &quot;Debo, no niego, pago lo justo&quot; (&quot;I owe, I don&#x27;t deny it, I&#x27;ll pay what is fair&quot;).

Members of &quot;El Barzón&quot; were responsible for massive amounts of debt denominated in dollars; which they were expected to pay back with a peso worth half of its previous value. Their debts would amount to ten times the loan they had originally taken out, and El Barzón refers to the massive social movement where elements of the traditionally quiet middle class rose up and refused to pay the monstrous sums of money that were expected of them by lending institutions. It was an accepted public venting of frustrations and helped to set up the PRI&#x27;s demise in the 2000 presidential elections.

&quot;El Barzón&quot; is a decentralized movement, and there were actually two main organizations, one that kept a pro-PRI stance and another that took a more leftist approach, siding with the PRD. There were several statewide organizations where debtors would receive legal and group support in exchange for a fee. Maximiano Barbosa Llamas founded this movement in Jalisco, Mexico. He was the most important leader of El Barzón A.C. Also he won a position on the congress by 1997.

One of the groups consisted of long-time members and supporters of the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) after the devaluation in December 1994 of the Mexican peso. This devaluation occurred during the Zedillo administration, but the administration blamed the outgoing President Salinas).

== History ==
In 1994, Mexico had unprecedented economic growth. Analysts even suggested that the country was in the verge of becoming a first-world country. In December Carlos Salinas de Gortari left the presidency and was campaigning to become the leader of the World Trade Organization. At the start of the term of President Ernesto Zedillo, the event known as the December mistake started the 1994 economic crisis where the peso suffered a devaluation from 3 to 6 pesos a dollar.

Many Mexican businesses, during the last years had acquired debts in dollars, or depended heavily on supplies from the United States. Their debt was increased automatically, worsened by the contingency measures that raised interest rates drastically. Many businesses were forced to close and there were several well-publicized suicides.

In this context, several middle-class businessmen, many from agricultural backgrounds, started to make uncoordinated protests starting mainly in northern states such as Chihuahua and Sonora. From these movements some leaders started to organize the seeds of El Barzón. In Zacatecas, Manuel Ortega González, Juan José Quirino Salas and Alfonso Ramírez Cuéllar started a movement that started protests such as partial road blocks using farm equipment. El Barzón has an institutional and juridical step 13 October 1994, in Monterrey, N. L. In that city, the heart of the neoliberalism in México, with Liliana Flores Benavides, Manuel Ortega González, Juan José Quirino Salas and Alfonso Ramírez Cuéllar designed the strategy of these unique social movement in the world.

The leaders of the movement were given prison sentences but were later released. Juan Quirino then became a national leader that created and organized Unión Nacional de Productores Agropecuarios, Comerciantes, Industriales y Prestadores de Servicios El Barzón A.C. in the whole country. 
The movement grew rapidly and soon every state had at least one representation. At that time it was a common banking practice to hire legal advisers who specialized in credit recovery. A frequent tactic was to write intimidating legal letters or place phone calls that threatened recipients with jail, property seizing and other legal measures to pressure and force people to pay. El Barzón provided legal counselling to advise debtors on how to defend their property and renegotiate their debts in better terms.

== Criticism ==
El Barzón has been criticized as being a movement that promotes a culture of ignoring debt through the use of legal or social pressure channels. The group presents itself however as a natural result of liberal economic policies gone wrong. They claim not to ignore debt but just to get a fair deal that works for both debtors and credit institutions alike.

Mainflingen is one of the two constituent communities of Mainhausen, the other one is Zellhausen.

==History==
Mainflingen was first mentioned in a document from the year 775. In this and other documents from 793, 796 and 799 it is confirmed that citizens of the municipality Manolfingen bequeathed fields and meadows to the monastery Lorsch. Researchers believe that the name is not derived from the river Main, but from a man named Manolf and his ancestors.

A document confirms that Witch-hunts also occurred in Mainflingen.

As a direct consequence of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Mainflingen and the surrounding communities had suffered severe population losses.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was approved by the Hessian Ministry of the Interior and Sport on 2 June 1955.

* Blazon The coat of arms of Mainflingen depicts a red shield with a silver wave band and an ascending white horse above it.

<doc id="633081" wikidata="Q256860" url="?curid=633081" title="Leopard gecko">
<text>The leopard gecko or common leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) is a ground-dwelling gecko native to the rocky dry grassland and desert regions of Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Nepal. The leopard gecko is a popular pet, and due to extensive captive breeding it is sometimes referred to as the first domesticated species of lizard.

==Taxonomy==
Leopard geckos were first described as a species by zoologist Edward Blyth in 1854 as &quot;Eublepharis macularius&quot;. The generic name &quot;Eublepharis&quot; is a combination of the Greek words &quot;eu&quot; (good) and &quot;blepharos&quot; (eyelid), as having mobile upper and lower eyelids is the primary characteristic that distinguishes members of this subfamily from other geckos, along with a lack of lamellae. The specific name &quot;macularius&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;macula&quot; meaning &quot;spot&quot; or &quot;blemish&quot;, referring to the animal&#x27;s natural spotted markings.

There are five subspecies of E. macularius:
*&quot;Eublepharis macularius afghanicus&quot;
*&quot;Eublepharis macularius fasciolatus&quot;
*&quot;Eublepharis macularius macularius&quot;
*&quot;Eublepharis macularius montanus&quot;
*&quot;Eublepharis macularius smithi&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
The native habitat of the leopard gecko includes the rocky, dry grassland, and desert regions of south-Asian Afghanistan, Pakistan, north-west India, western Nepal, and some parts of Iran. Leopard geckos inhabit arid and semi-arid areas with sparse vegetation and clay or sandy soils, as well as rocky habitat where crevices can be used as shelter. They reportedly avoid areas where the primary substrate is sand. Leopard geckos may also be found in arid forests of Nepal and Pakistan, and are reported to shelter under loose bark of trees in these environments. Winter temperatures within the range of the leopard gecko can be quite low, below , forcing the animals underground into semi-hibernation, called &quot;brumation&quot;, living on fat reserves.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Wild leopard geckos are generally considered to be nocturnal by field biology sources, academic herpetology sources, and some animal husbandry guides. During the day they retreat to burrows and sheltered hiding spots, becoming active at dusk when the temperature is favorable. Naturalist David Attenborough asserts in the wildlife documentary series &quot;Life in Cold Blood&quot;: &quot;A leopard gecko—like most geckos—is nocturnal, and it manages to get all the heat it needs from rocks, which retain something of their warmth for several hours after the sun has set.&quot; Similarly, Nepalese biologist Yam Rawat writes: &quot;Leopard Geckos remained undetected in Nepal until [2016]. This could be attributable to the secretive nocturnal nature of the species.&quot; In contrast, some sources focused on husbandry of captive leopard geckos have asserted leopard geckos are crepuscular or even cathemeral reptiles. This assertion has been used to explain the ability of leopard geckos to use UVB exposure to synthesize vitamin D3 in captivity, and as a rationale for providing captive leopard geckos with access to UVB lighting. John Courtney Smith, the brand manager for UVB light manufacturing company Arcadia Reptile, asserts in &quot;Bio-activity and the Theory of Wild Re-Creation&quot;: &quot;The leopard gecko is quite crepuscular in its home range ... there are many reports of them being seen even in full daytime desert sunlight openly basking&quot;.

There is also debate as to the degree that leopard geckos interact with conspecifics in the wild. Academic sources have asserted that leopard geckos live in loose colonies in the wild. Pet keeping guides often claim these geckos are solitary and do not usually live with other animals.

== Diet ==

Leopard geckos are opportunistic predators that eat a variety of prey items. Invertebrates are presumed to make up the majority of wild geckos&#x27; diets, but they will also eat small vertebrate prey if given the opportunity, including mouse pups, smaller reptiles, and even hatchling leopard geckos. Breeders of captive leopard geckos report that sufficiently fed leopard geckos will not cannibalize young, and that the cannibalistic behavior appears to take place only in poorly fed animals.

==Characteristics==

Leopard geckos are small lizards that derive their name from their spotted coloration. Hatchlings are on average in length and weigh about 2 to 5 grams. Adult females are about in length and weigh about 50 to 70 grams, while adult male geckos are about in length and weigh about 60 to 80 grams.

Unlike many other species of geckos, leopard gecko toes do not have adhesive lamellae, so they cannot climb smooth vertical walls.

In the wild, leopard geckos live for an average of 4.9 years, while in captivity they can live for more than 20 years with the proper care.

===Teeth===
Leopard geckos are polyphyodonts and able to replace each of their 100 teeth every 3 to 4 months. Next to the full grown tooth there is a small replacement tooth developing from the odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina.

===Tails===
Leopard geckos have distinctly thick tails that store fat; similar to the way in which camels&#x27; humps serve as reservoirs of fatty tissue, the fat stored in the tails of leopard geckos acts as an energy reserve that the geckos can use as nourishment if there is not an available food supply. When hunting, a leopard gecko may lift its tail in a twitching or wagging motion as it approaches its prey; after the gecko eats its prey, the tail will then return to a relaxed position.

Like most geckos, leopard geckos have an ability called autotomy: their tails can regenerate when lost; however, the regenerated tails appear stumpy and never have the same appearance as the original tail.

==Defense mechanisms==

Wild leopard geckos’ primary defense against predators is to avoid detection. This is accomplished with cryptic coloration serving as camouflage. They also remain hidden during daytime, to avoid heat and the risk of being spotted and captured by diurnal predators. If a leopard gecko is confronted by a potential predator, it may vocalize in an attempt to ward off this predator.

Leopard geckos also possess caudal autotomy; this is the ability to voluntarily detach their tail when attacked. After detachment the tail can continue to twitch for as long as 30 minutes, providing a distraction to buy time for the gecko to escape from its predator. The tail is large and at least in one related species (&quot;Christinus marmoratus&quot;) it has been reported that the tail-less fleeing gecko makes for a quicker getaway. Fractures in the tailbone allow the tail to separate easily and rapid vasoconstriction allows the gecko to suffer minimal blood loss. This detaching of the tail causes a high level of stress on the gecko due to the loss of the valuable storage of fat it once had. It will start to regenerate its tail immediately after detachment. Regenerated tails often retain similar colors to the original tail. However, they are often smooth and generally shorter and wider than the original tail.

== Chromatophores and color pigmentation ==

Leopard geckos range in color from a yellow to brownish-orange base with spots covering all or mostly half of the dorsal region of the body. Their color is derived from pigment-containing cells known as chromatophores. These cells are responsible for an array of coloration seen in all reptiles, amphibians, birds and some species of insects. Chromatophores come in a variety of types based on the color they correspond to. Chromatophore types include xanthophores (responsible for yellow coloration), erythrophores (responsible for red coloration), iridophores (responsible for iridescence), leucophores (responsible for white coloration), melanophores (responsible for black coloration), and cyanophores (responsible for blue coloration). The skin of wild leopard geckos contains xanthophores (yellow) and melanophores (black spots). Designer leopard geckos may possess erythrophores and leucophores since commercial breeding and artificial selection have allowed novel coloration to arise.

==Sexual dimorphism==
Sexual dimorphism is defined as a phenotypic difference between males and females of a species. It can be commonly found in animals, such as the leopard gecko and other reptiles. It exists in adult males and females, but can be difficult to determine in young geckos. The underside of a gecko truly determines the sex of the gecko. Males have pre-anal pores and hemipenal bulges while females have smaller pores and do not have external bulges.

Males can determine the sex of other leopard geckos by smelling pheromones on their skin. Males respond to males with aggressive behavior while they demonstrate courtship behavior towards females. Towards other males, the male would raise itself up from the ground, extend his limbs, and arch his back with the swelling of the tongue in aggression. He will then make short dashes and quick, vigorous bites, which frequently lacerate the skin and sometimes severely injure his opponent. Males behave the same way towards females while females are shedding their skin. Before and after the shedding of the skin, the males still express courtship behavior towards the females.

==Reproduction==

Leopard geckos typically breed in the summer. Females can store sperm over the course of their breeding season, and produce up to three clutches from one or two copulations. Females can lay about six to eight clutches of two eggs; eggs are laid approximately 21 to 28 days after mating. The average amount of time it takes for a newborn to hatch is anywhere between 35 and 89 days, although it is usually closer to the latter. Baby leopard geckos will have an &quot;egg tooth&quot;, a calcareous tip at the end of its snout to help break their egg shell. Their &quot;egg tooth&quot; will fall off within one to two days. In addition to this, their skin will usually shed within 24 hours of hatching. The leopard gecko hatchling will not be able to eat until after the first shedding.

Leopard geckos are also known to have temperature-dependent sex determination. Embryos incubated in predominantly cool temperatures (about ) or very warm temperatures (about ) will develop as females, while embryos incubated at intermediate temperatures (about ) will develop as male. Determination of sex is believed to be set during the first two weeks of incubation. Females born in the higher temperatures differed from those who were born in the lower temperatures hormonally and behaviorally. Those born in the warmer temperatures expressed more aggressive behavior. These are known as &quot;hot females&quot; and are often determined to be infertile.

==Leopard geckos as pets==

Leopard geckos are one of the most popular lizard pets, second only to the bearded dragon. They are possibly the first domesticated lizard species. They are easy to breed under captive conditions, so most sold are captive-bred rather than wild-caught. Due to extensive captive breeding and artificial selection, captive animals display a range of colors and patterns. Those found in the wild typically have more dull colorations than those kept in captivity as pets.

<doc id="633084" wikidata="Q113482920" url="?curid=633084" title="Viscount Severn">
<text>Viscount Severn is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The name of the viscountcy is derived from the River Severn that runs through England and Wales. The title, along with the Earldom of Wessex, was bestowed on Prince Edward by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, upon his marriage to Sophie Rhys-Jones. Between 1999 and 2023, the title was a subsidiary title of the Earldom of Wessex and Earldom of Forfar. Since 2023, the title is a subsidiary title of the Dukedom of Edinburgh upon the granting of the dukedom to Prince Edward.

== History ==
Viscount Severn was used by minor members of the royal family in the 18th century. There is a history of being given a secondary title so the eldest son can have it as a courtesy title.

The title Viscount Severn was given in allusion to the Welsh roots of Sophie Rhys-Jones&#x27;s family. The significance of this title is that it alludes to her ancestors having ruled the land Between Wye and Severn. This was the first time a royal prince was granted a viscountcy since 1726 when the title was given to two of George II&#x27;s sons.

===First creation, 1999===
Between 17th December 2007 and 10th March 2023, Viscount Severn was used as a courtesy title by Prince Edward&#x27;s son, James, Earl of Wessex. When his father was conferred the Dukedom of Edinburgh, James instead became styled Earl of Wessex. The title will once again be used as a courtesy title should James have a son.

<doc id="633086" wikidata="Q471969" url="?curid=633086" title="Métropole Européenne de Lille">
<text>The Métropole Européenne de Lille (, MEL; ) is the , an intercommunal structure, composed by a network of big cities (Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing, Villeneuve d&#x27;Ascq, Armentières etc.) whose major city is the city of Lille. It is located in the Nord department, in the Hauts-de-France region, northern France – bordering both the Flemish and Walloon regions of Belgium. It was created in January 2015, replacing the previous &quot;Communauté urbaine de Lille&quot;, and covers that part of the Lille metropolitan area that lies in France. Its area is 671.9 km2. Its population was 1,179,050 in 2019, of which 234,475 in Lille proper. The annual budget of the métropole is €1,865 billion (2018).

==History==
The urban community was founded in 1967 with Augustin Laurent as its first president.

Then, in 1971, Arthur Notebart, Deputy Mayor of Lomme, succeeded him until the election of Pierre Mauroy in 1989.

After the March 2008 municipal elections, each city council sent delegates to the urban community, a total of 170 voting members.

In April 2008, a new president was to be elected on a majority vote, defined at 816 votes. It caused for intense lobbying throughout the 85 cities and villages. One key issue was the investment priorities for the 2008/2014 period, namely transport, housing and the environment. The newly re-elected mayor of Lille, socialist Martine Aubry, tried to impose a new €800 million stadium in the eastern part of the community, which was opposed by three major mayors of her own party, who considered the project as misplaced and too expensive. 

On January 1, 2015, the métropole replaced the urban community in accordance with a law of January 2014. On January 1, 2017, the number of municipalities of the métropole increased from 85 to 90. It was expanded with the 5 communes of the former &quot;Communauté de communes de la Haute Deûle&quot; on March 14, 2020.

==Responsibilities==

===Local public transport===

The metropolitan community is responsible for the co-ordination of Ilévia, the private-sector company that operates a public transport network throughout the métropole. The network comprises buses, trams and a driverless metro system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The Lille Metro is a VAL system (&quot;véhicule automatique léger&quot; = light automated vehicle) that opened on May 16, 1983, becoming the first automatic metro line in the world. The metro system has two lines, with a total length of 45 km and 60 stations. The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. 68 urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.

==Cross-border cooperation==
The MEL metropolitan community encompasses only the French part of the urban area around Lille; the other part is on Belgian territory and outside the scope of MEL. 

The Eurometropolis Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai is a transnational structure founded on January 28, 2008 to overcome this problem, crossing borders and connecting Lille with the nearby Belgian cities Kortrijk, Mouscron and Tournai.

==Communes==
Métropole Européenne de Lille consists of the following 95 communes:

<text>Heart of Empire or The Legacy of Luther Arkwright is a limited series by Bryan Talbot, published in nine monthly parts in 1999 by American company Dark Horse Comics.

It is a sequel to his earlier work &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot;, set twenty-three years later, and centres on Arkwright&#x27;s daughter Victoria.

==Overview==
While the earlier work was highly experimental in its storytelling, with flashbacks and other multiple storylines running at different speeds and told in different styles, only resolving into a single narrative in the later part of the book, &quot;Heart of Empire&quot; is straightforwardly linear and drawn in a consistent style, with computer colouring by Angus McKie and lettering by Ellie DeVille. The pacing of the story is made more natural by the decision to vary the page count of the monthly comics to fit the demands of the storytelling. The story is nevertheless full of mythological, historical, artistic and political references, symbolism, and subliminal imagery. Many events echo those in &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot;.

As well as a collected paperback edition, &quot;Heart of Empire&quot; is available as a CD-ROM containing scans of the pencil roughs, black-and-white inks, final colour pages and high-resolution versions and a great deal of annotation and supplementary material from Talbot. It also includes scans of the whole of &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot;, from the recently created digital remastered version at the best resolution that it has ever been seen in. The CD is in some ways the &quot;Director&#x27;s cut&quot; of the comic and was created to answer the perennial &quot;where do you get your ideas from?&quot; question asked by fans. The first chapter of it was put online for free viewing due to the inherent difficulty in explaining what it contains.

A collected trade paperback edition, titled &quot;Heart of Empire: The Legacy of Luther Arkwright&quot;, was published by Dark Horse in 2001.

A third story, &quot;The Legend of Luther Arkwright&quot;, was published in July 2022 by Jonathan Cape.

==Synopsis==
The story is largely set on the same parallel on which the key events of &quot;Luther Arkwright&quot; occurred. Twenty-three years have passed (putting the date of the events at 2007), and England has emerged from its artificially prolonged Civil War to become the predominant world power under the autocratic rule of its psychic Queen Anne. The decadent court exhibits a mixture of Elizabethan, Restoration and Victorian styles. Ordinary people randomly &quot;disappear&quot; to an unknown fate in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor at Windsor Castle.

Anne&#x27;s only heir is Princess Victoria, her daughter by the long-vanished Luther Arkwright, born during the climactic battle twenty-three years earlier. Victoria is an engineering genius, but suffers constantly from nausea and headaches. Victoria&#x27;s twin brother Henry was assassinated at the age of ten, but when Victoria is told she resembles the revolutionary leader Gabriel Shelley, she becomes fascinated by the possibility that he is her brother, and starts a quest to learn about the circumstances of Henry&#x27;s death. Meanwhile, both a Papal Envoy and a group of fascists within the government plan to assassinate Anne and Victoria in order to seize the Empire for the Roman Catholic Church and themselves, respectively. Furthermore, the advanced society of parallel &quot;zero-zero&quot; has detected an imminent cataclysm centred on Victoria&#x27;s world, and tries in vain to contact Luther.

Gabriel Shelley is not Henry, but Victoria&#x27;s contact with him helps open her eyes to the oppressive nature of her mother&#x27;s empire. It also opens her eyes in other ways, as she accidentally takes a hallucinogen instead of a migraine remedy from his collection of homemade medicines. Under the influence of the potion, she makes her first jump across the parallels to meet her father. They return to Victoria&#x27;s world to defeat the true Heart of Empire and source of the imminent catastrophe - a psychic monster lurking in St George&#x27;s Chapel, created by Anne&#x27;s attempts to keep her son Henry alive. Anne is mortally wounded in combat with the Papal Envoy, and Victoria intervenes decisively to stop a massacre of democracy campaigners and kill the fascist ringleaders. In the final scene, she abdicates the throne and dissolves the Empire.

<text>Cigar (April 18, 1990 – October 7, 2014), was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was the 1995 and 1996 American Horse of the Year. He was the first American racehorse racing against top-class competition to win 16 consecutive races since Triple Crown winner Citation did so between 1948 and 1950. His major wins included the 1995 Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic, the NYRA Mile (later renamed in his honor), Jockey Club Gold Cup, Woodward Stakes (twice), Oaklawn Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup, Donn Handicap (twice) and the first running of the Dubai World Cup. He became the leading money earner in racing history and was later inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Originally campaigned on turf courses, he showed useful but unremarkable form in his early career. However, he emerged as an outstanding performer when switched to racing on dirt in late 1994. He was undefeated in 1995 in ten starts at racetracks across the United States, and received all but two of 306 ballots cast for American Horse of the Year. In 1996, he won the Dubai World Cup and three other races before his winning streak finally came to an end in August in the Pacific Classic. Despite narrowly losing two of his next three starts, he was named the America Horse of the Year for the second time. 

After his retirement from racing, Cigar proved to be infertile and was quickly retired from stud duties. He nevertheless enjoyed a long retirement at Kentucky Horse Park before dying at the age of 24.

==Background==
Cigar was a dark bay colt with three white socks on his legs and a white star and stripe on his forehead. He was bred in Maryland by Allen Paulson and was foaled at Country Life Farm near Bel Air, Maryland. He was sired by Palace Music, who was a Group 1 winner in England and a Grade I winner in the United States on the turf. Cigar&#x27;s success made Palace Music the leading sire in North America for 1995, but otherwise Palace Music was moderately successful with turf runners in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Cigar&#x27;s dam, Solar Slew, was by the 1977 Triple Crown winner, Seattle Slew. Cigar was a half-brother to Corridora Slew (ARG) by Corridor Key (USA), Mulca, and several other lesser performing horses. His second dam, Gold Sun, was a Group 1 winner in Argentina.

Madeleine A. Paulson was the original owner of Cigar. In his 2003 book, &quot;Legacies of the Turf&quot;, noted race historian Edward L. Bowen wrote that according to Paulson family banter, she traded Cigar to husband Allen for the filly Eliza, the 1992 Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Fillies winner and that year&#x27;s Eclipse Award choice for American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly.

Cigar was named after a navigational intersection for airplanes, not for the tobacco product. Owner Allen Paulson was a major figure in American aviation who had owned the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, which manufactured Gulfstream private business jets. He named many of his horses after the five-letter-long names given to intersections on aeronautical navigational charts.

Cigar stood at maturity. He had a scar on his chest as a result of a paddock accident as a weanling. As a young horse, he had a habit of kicking out at his handlers, earning him a nickname of &quot;the Hammer&quot;. He matured though into a kind horse who enjoyed greeting his fans and posing for the camera. His regular jockey, Jerry Bailey, later recalled a meeting between Cigar and Bailey&#x27;s three-year-old son the day after the 1995 Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic. &quot;He was just nuzzling on him,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;Less than 24 hours earlier he was on fire, just a machine, and now he was like a pony in the parking lot of the Kmart. He really liked people.&quot;

==Racing career==
===1993: three-year-old season===
Cigar did not race as a two-year-old. Under his first trainer, Alex Hassinger Jr., he won twice in nine starts at age three, but failed to win in stakes competition. He did finish second in the Grade III Volante Handicap at the Oak Tree Racing Association fall meeting at Santa Anita, and third in the Grade III Ascot Handicap at Bay Meadows. During this period, Hassinger switched from racing him on dirt to racing him on turf tracks, but the horse remained a low-grade stakes/high-class allowance horse. As a three-year-old, Cigar earned $89,175.

Cigar made his first start on February 21, 1993 at Santa Anita in a maiden special weight race over six furlongs on the dirt. He was never a factor, finishing sixth. He then had some bone chips removed from his knees and did not return until May 9 in another maiden special weight over six furlongs on the dirt. He broke slowly but rushed up to second place after a fast opening quarter-mile in 22.19 seconds. He moved to the lead on the turn and continued to draw away to win by lengths.

For his next starts, Hassinger switched Cigar to turf races over miles with moderate results. On May 23, Cigar finished fourth in an allowance race after leading with a furlong to go, then finished third in his next start on June 12. On August 18 though, he displayed a burst of speed at the top of the stretch that quickly moved him from fifth to first. He continued to draw away to win by lengths.

After finishing second in his next start, Cigar made his graded stakes debut in the Ascot Handicap at Bay Meadows. He raced near the front of the pack for the first three-quarters before taking the lead turning for home, opening a -length in mid-stretch. However, he was caught at the finish line and finished third, beaten by a neck. He then finished second in the Volante Handicap on November 5 before finishing a distant eleventh in the Hollywood Derby on November 30.

===1994: four-year-old season===
The following year, Cigar was sent to an east-coast trainer, Bill Mott, who gave him the first half of the year off, bringing him back to racing in July. Cigar had moderate success in his first four starts of the year before breaking through with a dominant win in an allowance race on October 28. He followed up with his first Grade I win in the NYRA Mile (now the Cigar Mile Handicap), finishing the year with two wins from six starts and earnings of $180,838.

Cigar made his first start of the year on July 8 in an allowance race over miles on the turf at Belmont Park. He vied for the early lead with Victory Cross but tired and finished fourth, beaten by nine lengths. Over the next two months, he continued to race in allowance races on the turf, finishing third on August 9 at Saratoga, seventh on September 16 at Belmont Park, and third on October 7 at Belmont Park. For his next start at Aqueduct on October 28, Mott switched Cigar back to dirt in a one-mile allowance race for non-winners of two races other than maiden or claiming (NW2 X). Cigar challenged for the early lead with the favorite, Golden Plover, completing the first quarter-mile in 22.42 seconds. Cigar then took the lead and drew away, winning by eight lengths. He did not lose again for 22 months. 

Mott decided to step Cigar sharply up in class, entering him in the Grade I NYRA Mile at Aqueduct on November 26. He went off at odds of 9-1 in a field of twelve that featured stakes winners Devil His Due, Brunswick, Itaka, Bertrando, and Harlan. Cigar raced for the first half mile in fourth place, then made a strong move on the turn and opened up to win by seven lengths. &quot;Cigar really smoked them,&quot; said jockey Jerry Bailey. &quot;I rode him before, but that was on grass and he was flat that day. On the dirt, he&#x27;s been different.&quot;

===1995: five-year-old season===
At age 5, Cigar scored ten wins from ten starts, earning Beyer Speed Figures of 108, 114, 116, 121, 114, 117, 118, 111, 111, and 117. He travelled widely, winning races in Florida, Arkansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, California, and New York. Mott later commented, &quot;I knew what was going on was special and was never going to happen again. The really good ones win races when they are not at their best. Whether he was coming off a layoff, or had a foot issue, or got caught in compromising position in a race. Cigar overcame all those.&quot;

Cigar started 1995 on January 22 in a mile allowance race at Gulfstream Park in January, which he won by two lengths. He then faced the 1994 American Horse of the Year Holy Bull in the Donn Handicap on February 11 at miles. Holy Bull was heavily favored based on his dominant 1994 campaign, with Cigar going off at 4-1. Cigar went to the early lead with Holy Bull pushing the pace to his outside. The two completed the half-mile heads apart in 46.48 seconds. However, as they turned into the backstretch, Holy Bull suffered a strain of the superficial flexor tendon and was pulled up. Cigar won, but little attention was paid to his victory due to the breakdown of Holy Bull, which signaled the end of his racing career. Cigar&#x27;s winning streak stood at four.

He made his next start on March 5 in the Gulfstream Park Handicap over a distance of miles, and went off as the heavy 1-2 favorite in a field of eleven. He rated behind the early pace set by Northern Trend, then quickly moved to the lead near the top of the stretch. He continued to draw away and won &quot;as rider pleased&quot; by lengths. Cigar then went to Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas for the Oaklawn Handicap at miles. The field featured several other highly rated older horses, including 1994 Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic winner Concern, who carried top weight of 122 pounds compared to Cigar at 120 pounds, and Silver Goblin, who was also on an extended winning streak, at 119 pounds. Cigar settled into position a few lengths behind the early leader, then started his move on the final turn. Silver Goblin was slightly ahead near the top of the stretch when his jockey accidentally struck Cigar in the face with his whip. Cigar briefly checked but then pinned back his ears and rallied, drawing away to win by lengths in a time of 1:47.22.

Next was the Pimlico Special on May 13 at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore at miles. Cigar was the odds-on favorite despite carrying top weight of 122 pounds, compared to Devil His Due and Concern both at 121 pounds. In the absence of other early speed horses, Cigar went to the lead and set moderate opening fractions of 24.38 for the first quarter-mile and 48.16 for the half. He opened up his lead in midstretch and won under a hand ride by lengths in a time of 1:53.72. &quot;I think he&#x27;s more versatile than any horse I&#x27;ve ever seen,&quot; said Paulson. &quot;He can be behind. He can be in front. There&#x27;s no way to defend against him.&quot;

For his next start, Cigar shipped to Suffolk Downs north of Boston for the Massachusetts Handicap at miles on June 3. He was eligible for a $500,000 bonus after also winning the Gulfstream Park Handicap, Oaklawn Handicap, and Pimlico Special. He was the overwhelming favorite at 1-5 despite carrying 124 pounds, 9 to 17 pounds higher than his rivals. He tracked the early pace, then made his move turning into the stretch. He quickly opened a lead and won by four lengths in a time of 1:48.74. &quot;If Cigar runs like he&#x27;s been running, there isn&#x27;t any horse that can beat him,&quot; said Bailey. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to get this horse in trouble. You almost have to go out of your way.&quot;

His connections originally planned to give Cigar some time off but decided instead to travel to California for the Hollywood Gold Cup at Hollywood Park on July 2 when the purse was increased to $1 million. Many great horses from the east, such as Kelso and Seattle Slew, suffered losses on the faster, harder California racing surfaces. The California track also assembled one of the greatest fields in the race&#x27;s history, including Santa Anita Handicap and Pacific Classic Stakes winner Best Pal, Pacific Classic Stakes winner Tinners Way, Santa Anita Handicap winner Urgent Request, and old rival Concern, who had just won the Gold Cup&#x27;s major preparatory race, the Californian Stakes. Nonetheless, Cigar was the odds-on favorite despite carrying top weight of . He broke well and rated a few lengths behind the early pace. Turning into the stretch, he swept to the lead and drew away to win by lengths in a time of 1:59.46. &quot;We put him into a situation where he could have gotten beat, but it didn&#x27;t matter,&quot; said Mott.

After returning to the east coast, Cigar was given a brief layoff before resuming training. He made his next start on September 16 at Belmont Park in the Woodward Stakes over miles. In a field of nine that contained few serious contenders, he went off as the 1-10 favorite. He was even more heavily bet in the show wagering, creating the largest minus pool in New York&#x27;s history. He tracked the early pace set by Star Standard, then moved to the lead in the stretch to win in hand by lengths in 1:47.07. &quot;He was pretty devastating,&quot; said Bailey.

Cigar’s next start was on October 7 in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont over a distance of miles. He was again the odds-on favorite, with his main competition expected to come from three-year-old Thunder Gulch, who had won the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. Star Standard set the early pace, tracked closely by Thunder Gulch on the inside and Cigar on the outside. When Cigar started his move on the turn into the stretch, Thunder Gulch could not keep pace, eventually finishing fourth. Cigar opened up a -length lead in midstretch, then stood off a late run by Unaccounted For to win by a length in a time of 2:01.29. Cigar had not relished the going, which was heavy due to earlier rain, and it was the closest he had come to defeat in his now eleven-race win streak. &quot;I would have to say this was probably not Cigar&#x27;s best race,” said Mott. &quot;He was used more, [Bailey] had to go to the whip... he had to reach down and ask him. It looked as if he had to put him into a little more of a drive. But he still won by a clear length.&quot;

====Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic====
Cigar ended the season by winning the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic at Belmont Park on October 28. He was the odds-on favorite in a field of eleven horses, most of which he had already beaten. The main concern was that predicted heavy rain could turn the track muddy, a surface over which Cigar had never run. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing I can do about it,&quot; said Mott on the day before the race. &quot;We know it&#x27;s going to rain, and we know there&#x27;s going to be some mud. But we&#x27;re running no matter what. If he gets beat, so be it, but we&#x27;re not afraid of anything.&quot;

Bailey was also concerned by his outside post position, number 10, on a day where most winners had run along the rail. Knowing Cigar risked getting stranded out wide for the entire race, Bailey urged him strongly from the starting gate and settled into third place behind L&#x27;Carriere and Star Standard, with Unaccounted For to his inside in fourth. &quot;He leaves the gate wanting to go to the lead, and usually I have to discourage him from doing that,&quot; said Bailey. &quot;But this time I gave him his head. When he got up there, I had to spend the next three-eighths of a mile trying to get him back. By that point I
needed a little rest on my arms.&quot;

The opening fractions were moderate, 24.21 seconds for the first quarter-mile and 48.35 for the half, and Cigar moved easily down the backstretch. Late on the final turn, he made his move and quickly opened a lead on the rest of the field. He was never challenged in the stretch and won by lengths. The final time of 1:59.58 was then the fastest Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic ever run, despite the muddy track condition. &quot;Cigar is so fluid and so efficient that the only way you know you&#x27;re going faster is when you look over and see you&#x27;re going past everyone,” said Bailey. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if this was his best race, but it was his most important race. He did it the same way we&#x27;ve seen him do it so many times before. I don&#x27;t know if he can duplicate this year. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible for him or anybody else.&quot;

As Cigar swept to the lead, track announcer Tom Durkin gave one of the most famous calls in racing history:

Cigar had completed a perfect season, 10 for 10, with earnings of $4,819,800. In doing so, he matched Spectacular Bid&#x27;s record in 1980, the most dominant campaign of that decade. Sportswriter Andrew Beyer said that &quot;it was certainly safe to say [Cigar] is the best of the 1990s&quot; due to his versatility. He received all but two of 306 ballots cast for Horse of the Year and was also named American Champion Older Male Horse. He had won a record eight Grade I events in a single season, equalled only by Lady&#x27;s Secret in 1986. During 1995, Cigar set a single-season stakes-winning record for a North American-based Thoroughbred of $4,819,800, surpassing Sunday Silence&#x27;s mark of $4,578,454.

===1996: six-year-old season===
Cigar&#x27;s six-year-old campaign started on a high note, with wins in the Donn Handicap and the newly created Dubai World Cup making him the world&#x27;s richest racehorse. He then extended his winning streak to 16, matching the great Citation, before he was finally defeated in the Pacific Classic in August. He finished the year with a win in the Woodward Stakes followed by narrow losses in the Jockey Club Gold Cup and Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic. He was again named American Horse of the Year.

Cigar started his 1996 campaign on February 10 in the Donn Handicap, where he carried 128 pounds – 11 to 18 pounds more than the other entrants. Despite the weight difference, he was the heavy 1-5 favorite. He broke well then settled into third position off the opening pace set by Flying Chevron and Star Standard. He started his move on the far turn, followed by stablemate Wekiva Springs who moved to within a head as they turned into the stretch. In response to the challenge, Cigar quickly pulled away and won easily by two lengths. &quot;He&#x27;s going to be vulnerable because we&#x27;re dealing with handicaps,&quot; said Mott. &quot;I know some day this has got to come to an end, because we all get older,&quot; he added. &quot;But Cigar has gotten stronger with every race. He just gets better and better.&quot;

Cigar&#x27;s next start was expected to be in the Santa Anita Handicap but he had to miss the race after developing an abscess in his right front foot. Instead, he had eleven days of stall rest before resuming training for his next target, the inaugural Dubai World Cup, the world&#x27;s richest horse race with a $4,000,000 purse. Cigar had to travel roughly from Florida to Dubai for the race, a journey of about 20 hours. Mott faced some criticism for the decision to run but responded by saying, &quot;If I didn&#x27;t think he was up to it, he wouldn&#x27;t be going.&quot; Great horses had rarely traveled so far, duplicated their form, and then returned home in good shape. 

The Dubai World Cup attracted a top quality field from around the world. The American contingent also included L&#x27;Carriere (second in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic) and Soul of the Matter (fourth in the Classic), while international challengers included Pentire, a multiple Group 1 winner from England, and Danewin with five Group 1 wins in Australia. Running at night and over a deep, sandy track made even heavier by recent rainfall, Cigar was also racing for the first time in twelve starts without Lasix. To further complicate matters, he broke poorly. &quot;His rear end sort of came out from behind him,&quot; said Bailey. &quot;He didn&#x27;t handle the track very well.&quot;

Cigar found himself in the middle of the field behind the early pace set by L&#x27;Carriere. On the backstretch, he worked his way up to fourth, then launched his bid for the lead on the final turn. He pulled away from L&#x27;Carriere near the top of the stretch but then had to withstand a late run from Soul of the Matter. Soul of the Matter pulled almost alongside before Cigar responded to win by less than a length. &quot;I don&#x27;t think it was his best performance,&quot; said Bailey, &quot;but I think it might have been his best effort.&quot; He was now the world&#x27;s highest stakes-winning racehorse, and his streak stood at 14.

Cigar returned to seek a repeat win in the Massachusetts Handicap, where the largest crowd in the history of Suffolk Downs turned out to see him. He had to pass another test of greatness by carrying in the race. Cigar won again for his 15th straight victory, the longest winning sequence for a major American stakes horse since Citation, who won 16 in a row in 1948 and 1950. 

Arlington Park carded a special race, the Arlington Citation Challenge, for Cigar to attempt to tie Citation&#x27;s streak. He faced Dramatic Gold and Unbridled&#x27;s Song and again carried . He pulled away from Dramatic Gold nearing the wire to win his 16th race in a row.

====The end of the winning streak====
Cigar next attempted to surpass Citation&#x27;s record in the Pacific Classic Stakes at Del Mar Thoroughbred Club near San Diego, California. Another record crowd of over 40,000 attended. As in his last race in California, the Hollywood Gold Cup, Bailey took Cigar wide most of the way. However, he was drawn into a three-horse speed duel with the good stakes horses Siphon and Dramatic Gold, going the first of a mile in a very fast 1:09 1/5. The speed duel caused all the leaders to tire, and Dare And Go, ridden by Alex Solis, passed Cigar in the stretch to score the upset, with Cigar finishing second.

Cigar rebounded in the 1996 Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park, which was his last victory ever. Cigar lost to Skip Away (who went on to win the 1997 Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic and the 1998 Horse of the Year title) in the Jockey Club Gold Cup.

====Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic====
Cigar&#x27;s final start was in the 1996 Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic, held on October 26 at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Canada. After Skip Away bypassed the race, Cigar went off as the 3-5 odds-on favorite in a deep field that also included Grade I winners Will&#x27;s Way (Travers Stakes), Atticus (Kentucky Cup Classic), Dare and Go (Pacific Classic), Editor&#x27;s Note (Belmont Stakes), Dramatic Gold (Meadowlands Cup), Mahogany Hall (Whitney Handicap) and Louis Quatorze (Preakness Stakes). Alphabet Soup was a 20-1 longshot after having been disqualified from a win in his previous start. Cigar came into the race a bit short of training after his right front hoof required patching. He shipped to Woodbine on the 23rd, walked the paddock on the 24th and then had a strong gallop on the 25th. &quot;Let&#x27;s face it,&quot; said Jim Bond, the trainer of L’Carriere, who had faced off with Cigar in the Dubai World Cup. &quot;Cigar is vulnerable. He’s had a long, tough year. It took L’Carriere a long time to recover from running in Dubai, and Cigar really didn’t take that much time off. I think it may finally be catching up with him.&quot;

The early speed horses, Atticus, Louis Quatorze and Alphabet Soup, all drew outside posts on a track that appeared to favor horses on the inside. Accordingly, the three horses all broke fast and quickly shifted over to the rail, running the opening quarter-mile in 22 seconds. Cigar broke slowly and on the wrong lead, and found himself in tight quarters in the middle of the pack. He started his move on the far turn but lacked his normal acceleration while running five wide. Turning into the stretch, Mt Sassafrass briefly took the lead before Alphabet Soup and Louis Quatorze rallied, racing heads apart through the final furlong. Cigar inched his way into third but could not get by, losing by a head to Alphabet Soup, who was a nose in front of Louis Quartorze. The final time of 2:01 set a new track record.

As a six-year-old, Cigar won five of eight starts and $4,910,000, breaking his own single-season earnings record. His third-place finish at Woodbine cost him the chance to be the first horse to win $10 million; he finished with $9,999,815.

Until Curlin surpassed him in 2008, Cigar was America&#x27;s top money earner.
==Honors==
Further accolades came when Cigar was named the Racehorse of the Decade of the 1990s. In 2002, he was inducted in his first year of eligibility into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Cigar was ranked #18. In accordance with that ranking, Cigar is the highest-ranked American Thoroughbred during the decade of the nineties (1990–1999) and therefore lays claim to the title American &quot;Horse of the Decade.&quot;

Cigar won four Eclipse Awards. In 1995, he was named the American Horse of the Year and Champion Older Male Horse. Despite the losses during his six-year old campaign, he was named Horse of the Year and Champion Older Male Horse again in 1996.

On February 2, 1997, a life-size bronze statue of Cigar was unveiled at Florida&#x27;s Gulfstream Park on &quot;A Salute to Cigar Day.&quot; Also in 1997, the New York Racing Association renamed the Grade I NYRA Mile, run in November at Aqueduct, as the Cigar Mile. The NYRA Mile was the second race in Cigar&#x27;s winning streak and his first Grade I win. On October 27, 2015, the Kentucky Horse Park unveiled a bronze statue of Cigar by Douwe Blumberg.

==Retirement==
Cigar was retired to stud at the end of the 1996 racing season. Ceremonies took place during the National Horse Show at Madison Square Garden to honor the horse. Cigar was vanned through New York City accompanied for the last few blocks by the New York Knicks cheerleaders and the Budweiser Clydesdales. In the Garden, he was cantered around the arena by Bailey before the lights went out and a trumpeter started to play Auld Lang Syne. Veteran sportswriter Steve Haskin called it &quot;he single most emotional moment I’ve ever experienced in racing.&quot;

Paulson sold 75% of Cigar to Coolmore Stud and Michael Tabor, and this equated to a value of $25 million for him. He was taken to stand at the Ashford Stud, the American division of Coolmore Stud, and began his coverings there in February. An insurance policy on Cigar required that he cover 20 mares twice and get at least 60 percent of them in foal to be considered fertile. He proved infertile as a stallion, as none of the 34 mares bred to him became pregnant.

Cigar lived out his retirement at the Kentucky Horse Park&#x27;s Hall of Champions in Lexington. Around April 2014, Cigar began to suffer increasingly from osteoarthritis in his spine, leading to instability in his legs. He underwent surgery to correct the problem but complications ensued and he died on October 7.

<text>The Northern Ireland Policing Board (, Ulster-Scots: &quot;Norlin Airlan Polisin Boord&quot;) is the police authority for Northern Ireland, charged with supervising the activities of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). It is a non-departmental public body composed of members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and independent citizens who are appointed by the Minister of Justice using the Nolan principles for public appointments.

==History==
The board is not the first police oversight body in the history of Northern Ireland. It was established on 4 November 2001 pursuant to the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, as the direct successor of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, which oversaw the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Appointments were made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland prior to the devolution of policing and justice.

When the Assembly was suspended in October 2002, the first board&#x27;s members were re-appointed as independents by the Secretary of State to enable it to continue its work (despite most being political representatives). The Policing Board was reconstituted on 1 April 2006, 22 May 2007 and again on 24 May 2011.

The third reconstitution of the board in 2007 was historic as Sinn Féin took up its seats on the Policing Board following the party&#x27;s decision to support &#x27;civic policing&#x27; by the PSNI at its ardfheis on 28 January 2007. Sinn Féin was associated in the past with the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), which killed 271 Royal Ulster Constabulary officers and 12 police officers outside Northern Ireland during the Troubles, and had refused to recognise the legal authority of the RUC or PSNI until that point.

On 7 February 2008, the Policing Board decided to appoint a panel of independent experts to re-review the police investigation of the Omagh bombing. Some of the relatives of the bombing victims criticised the decision, saying that an international public inquiry covering both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland should be established instead. The review was to determine whether enough evidence existed for further prosecutions. It would also investigate the possible perjury of two police witnesses made during the trial of suspect Sean Hoey.
Sinn Féin Policing Board member Alex Maskey stated that his party fully supported the families&#x27; right to call for a &quot;full cross-border independent inquiry&quot; while the Policing Board had a &quot;clear and legal obligation to scrutinise the police handling of the investigations.&quot; He also stated: &quot;We recognise that the board has a major responsibility in carrying out our duty in holding the PSNI to account in the interests of justice for the Omagh families.&quot;

On 22 November 2009, a 400lb car bomb was driven to the Policing Board building in Belfast. It partially exploded but no one was hurt. Republican dissidents tried to ambush policemen on the same day. The incident was one of several cross-border attacks carried out by hardline republicans in 2009–2010; others included the 2010 Newry car bombing.

==Composition==
According to the department, the appointment of all independent members is made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, the Commissioner for Public Appointments for Northern Ireland requires that the political activity of appointees be published, for accountability.

The practice of appointing &#x27;independent&#x27; members, who were also full members of political parties, was also common across the district policing partnerships organised by the Policing Board, thus reducing the number of places available for members of the public with no political connections.
