<text>The Reuss (; ) is a river in Switzerland. With a length of and a drainage basin of , it is the fourth largest river in Switzerland (after the Rhine, Aare and Rhône). The upper Reuss forms the main valley of the canton of Uri. The course of the lower Reuss runs from Lake Lucerne to the confluence with the Aare at Brugg and Windisch.

The Reuss is one of the four major rivers taking their source in the Gotthard region, along with the Rhine, Ticino and Rhône.

==Geography==

===Course===



The Gotthardreuss rises in the Gotthard massif, emerging from Lago di Lucendro (reservoir built in 1947; elevation 2,131 m) in the canton of Ticino and passing into the canton of Uri below the &quot;Brigghubel&quot; (1,898 m).

The Furkareuss rises east of Furka Pass (2,429 m), early joined by the &quot;Blaubergbach&quot; (sourced by two mountain lakes on 2,649 m) and several other creeks sourced by still existing glaciers, such as &quot;Sidelengletscher&quot; (3,170 m), &quot;Tiefengletscher&quot; (3,285 m) in the north, and &quot;Muttengletscher&quot; (2,908 m) and &quot;Witenwassergletscher&quot; (2,805 m) in the south, and eventually forms the east–west valley called Urseren, passing Realp at halfway through the valley at 1,540 m in eastern direction until its eastern end at Andermatt. This source is only around 5 km away from, and on the same mountain massif as the source of the Rhône, but will ultimately lead to the opposite side of the continent.

Gotthardreuss and Furkareuss join at Hospental (1,446 m). Downstream of Andermatt the Reuss joins at 1,429 m the village creek &quot;Unteralpreuss&quot;, finally turns to the north, and passes through the 3 km-long narrow and deep Schöllenen Gorge and under the legendary Devil&#x27;s Bridge (1,120 m).

At Göschenen (1,057 m) it is joined by the &quot;Göschenerreuss&quot;, sourced by the glaciers &quot;Dammagletscher&quot; (3,430 m) and &quot;Flachensteinfirn&quot; (3,150 m) besides several others. From here it forms the main valley of the canton of Uri, the &quot;Urner Reusstal&quot;, passing below Wassen (840 m), Gurtnellen (720 m), Amsteg and Silenen (500 m), and through Erstfeld (460 m), past Attinghausen and Altdorf (440 m), joining the southernmost part of Lake Lucerne (the &quot;Urnersee&quot;) between Flüelen and Seedorf (434 m). The Reuss leaves Lake Lucerne some 30 km to the north-west, at the city of Lucerne.

Notable bridges in Lucerne are the Kapellbrücke, first built 1333, rebuilt 1993 and Spreuerbrücke, built 1408. A needle dam just upstream from the Spreuerbrücke) maintains the water level.

It receives the Kleine Emme from Entlebuch at Emmen (432 m). From here, it flows north-east through Buchrain, Root, Gisikon and Honau, and downstream of Honau (402 m) leaves the canton of Lucerne, now forming the border between Aargau and Zug, passing Dietwil (Aargau), Risch-Rotkreuz (Zug), Oberrüti (Aargau) and Sins (Aargau), Hünenberg (Zug) and Mühlau (Aargau). It receives the Lorze from Lake Zug downstream of Maschwanden.

Downstream of this confluence, the Reuss forms the border between Aargau and Zürich, passing Merenschwand (Aargau, 389 m) and Ottenbach (Zurich, 384 m), and enters Aargau downstream of Ottenbach.

Within Aargau, the Reuss flows past Aristau, Jonen, Rottenschwil, Unterlunkhofen, Hermetschwil-Staffeln, here forming Flachsee (380 m), and onward to Zufikon, Bremgarten (370 m). The Reussbrücke at Bremgarten was first built c. 1270, first mentioned 1281 (wooden bridge rebuilt 1953–1957).

From Bremgarten, the Reuss meanders between the villages of Eggenwil, Fischbach-Göslikon, Künten, Niederwil, to Stetten (352 m), flowing past Tägerig, Mellingen (350 m), Birrhard (340 m), Mülligen, Birmenstorf and between Windisch and Gebenstorf, finally joining the Aare just downstream of Brugg, at 327 m.

After the confluence the river continues as the Aare, which flows into the Rhine at Koblenz.

===Catchment area===
The catchment area of approximately covers Central Switzerland.

The catchment area of the upper Reuss includes almost the entire canton of Uri (with the exception of the Urner Boden, and in the uppermost part of the Gotthardreuss a portion of Ticino (Airolo municipality). The highest point of the drainage basin is the summit of Dammastock, at elevation 3,630 m.

The basin of the lower Reuss adds the catchment areas of other tributaries of Lake Lucerne as well as that of the Kleine Emme, including most of Nidwalden and Obwalden, and parts of Schwyz, Lucerne and Zug. Downstream of Lucerne, further tributaries add other parts of Zug as well as parts of Zürich and Aargau.

==History==

===Name===
Ptolemy records the river&#x27;s pre-Germanic name as &quot;Silana&quot; (whence the name of Silenen).
The Germanic name is attested as &quot;Rusa&quot;, &quot;Rusia&quot; from the 9th century (sometimes recorded as &quot;Ursa&quot; in the Early Modern period, c.f. &quot;Urseren&quot;), from an early Germanic &quot;*Rūsi&quot;, oblique &quot;*Rūsjō-&quot;.

Greule (1982) interprets the name as an Old European hydronym, directly cognate with &quot;Riß&quot;. Because of Ptolemy&#x27;s record of the pre-Germanic name &quot;Silana&quot;, it is possible that only part of the river was known as &quot;*Rūsi&quot; in antiquity; alternatively, &quot;*Rūsi&quot; has been interpreted as a purely Germanic name introduced with Germanic settlement in the early medieval period, a derivation from OHG &quot;rūsa, riusa&quot; &quot;fish trap&quot;.

===Upper Reuss===
Until the 13th century, the Schöllenen Gorge was impassable, separating Urseren from Uri. Urseren was accessible via Furka and Oberalp, and was under the influence of the bishopric of Chur.

The main settlement area of Uri was the plain of the Reuss estuary Altdorf (&quot;Reussebene&quot;). Settlements tended to form on either side of the river, while the river itself was often taken as communal or parish boundary.

The Schöllenen Gorge was made passable the 1230s, opening access to the Gotthard Pass. This resulted in an immense increase of the strategic value of the Reuss valley, as reflected in the grant of imperial immediacy to Uri and the wider political backdrop of the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy.

The Reuss was canalised between Attinghausen and Altdorf in 1850–1863, and to the river mouth in 1900–1912, significantly increasing the arable land in the Reuss plain. A small river delta was reconstructed in 1985. After flooding in 1987, improved flood control measures were constructed during 1995–1999.

A small hydroelectric plant was built in Schöllenen Gorge for the construction of the Gotthard Tunnel in 1875. Larger hydroelectric plants were built at Amsteg (1922), Wassen (1949) and Göschenen (1962).

===Lower Reuss===
The lower Reuss flows along a series of former glacial lakes. Settlements along the river were built on lateral moraines, while the river bed itself was marshy and subject to flooding, and thus unsuitable for settlement. The oldest river crossings are along terminal moraines between the former glacial lakes.
The Reuss valley was under Habsburg Austrian rule during the 14th century.

In the 15th century, the Reuss became the border between territories of the Swiss Confederacy, in 1429 between Lucerne and Zürich, and later between Zug, Zürich and the Freie Ämter condominium, between Freie Ämter and Baden, and between Baden and Berne. The Reuss downstream of Ottenbach came to lie within Aargau with the creation of this canton in 1803.

The Reuss had the status of &quot;imperial road&quot; (&quot;freie Reichsstrasse&quot;) in the late medieval period. Until 1798, it was the responsibility of cantonal authorities (the &quot;Reussherren&quot; of Lucerne and Zug) to keep the river navigable. The river was important as waterway for traffic between Lucerne and Zurzach, and via Aare and Rhine to Basel, until the construction of transit roads in the 18th century. River crossings by ferry in the medieval period were at Lunkhofen (mentioned 1160), Windisch, Sins, Mühlau, Oberrüti, and Dietwil. The crossing at Lunkhofen was on the main route from Zürich to Berne. Bridges across the Reuss were in Lucerne, Bremgarten (1230), Mellingen (mentioned 1253) and Gisikon (1432). In 1528, the Catholic cantons blocked the trade routes across the Reuss for Protestant cantons and trade between Zürich and Berne was re-routed through Windisch.

Because ferries and bridges were a source of income, the construction of new crossings was opposed during the early modern period, and only one new bridge was built, commissioned by Zug, at Sins (1640). New bridges were built only after the collapse of the Old Swiss Confederacy, e.g. at Windisch (1799), Ottenbach (1864) and Mühlau (1940).

By the end of the 20th century, there were more than a dozen crossings of the lower Reuss, including a number of railway and motorway bridges.

Projects for canalisation in 1648 (Hans Conrad Gyger) and 1809 (Johann Gottfried Tulla) were not realised.

In 1840, Aargau constructed some canalisation, with limited impact. A large-scale project of river engineering was completed during 1971–1985 (&quot;Reusstalsanierung&quot;). The hydroelectric plant at Bremgarten-Zufikon was built in 1893 and enlarged in 1975 (Flachsee reservoir).

<text>The Canadian River is the longest tributary of the Arkansas River in the United States. It is about long, starting in Colorado and traveling through New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, and Oklahoma. The drainage area is about .

The Canadian is sometimes referred to as the South Canadian River to differentiate it from the North Canadian River that flows into it.

==Etymology==
On John C. Fremont&#x27;s route map of 1845, the river&#x27;s name is listed as &quot;Goo-al-pah or Canadian River&quot; from the Comanche and Kiowa name for the river (Kiowa &quot;gúlvàu&quot;, &#x27;red river&#x27;). In 1929, Muriel H. Wright wrote that the Canadian River was named about 1820 by French traders who noted another group of traders from Canada (&quot;Canadiens&quot;) had camped on the river near its confluence with the Arkansas River.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, Spanish explorers in the 17th and 18th centuries called it the &quot;Rio Buenaventura&quot; and the &quot;Magdalena&quot;. The upper part was called &quot;Rio Colorado&quot; by the Spanish.

A more recent explanation comes from William Bright, who wrote that the name is &quot;probably derived from &quot;Río Canadiano&quot;&quot;, a Spanish spelling of the Caddo word &quot;káyántinu&quot;, which was the Caddo people&#x27;s name for the nearby Red River.

The name could be of Spanish origin from the word &quot;cañada&quot; (meaning &quot;glen&quot;), as the Canadian River formed a steep canyon in northern New Mexico and a somewhat broad canyon in Texas. A few historical records document that explanation. Edward Hale, writing in 1929, considered the French origin of the name most probable. In fact, the river was regularly used by Canadian fur traders (such as Louis Feuilli and Jean Chapuis, as well as the Mallet Brothers) trying to establish contact with Santa Fe as early as 1752.

==History==
The first European to explore the Canadian River was Juan de Oñate, the Spanish Governor of New Mexico, who followed the river from its origin to the western plains of what is now Oklahoma in 1601. Spanish traders and hunters were soon actively working in this area. French voyageurs were active along the lower Canadian. Bénard de la Harpe explored between the mouth of the river and the Kiamichi Mountains in 1715. Pierre and Paul Mallet followed the entire length of the river in 1740, as did another expedition led by Fabry de la Bruyère in 1741. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 resulted in all of the land east of the New Mexico border being acquired by the United States.

In 1818, the Quapaw tribe ceded all its land north of the Canadian to the United States, thus making this river the effective southern boundary of the new nation. In 1825, the Osage ceded their claims to land along the river. The Canadian was designated as the boundary between the Creek-Seminole lands on the north side and the Choctaw (and later the Chickasaw) on the south side. Major Stephen H. Long led an expedition up the Canadian River in 1821. He proclaimed the land along the river as the Great American Desert. Despite this assessment, trading posts were established along the river, starting with Edwards&#x27; Post at the mouth of Little River. Camp Holmes was established by Colonel Henry Dodge&#x27;s Dragoons in 1834. Captain Nathan Boone led a dragoon troop up the river to the 100th Meridian, which was then the western border of the United States. &quot;See also: Stephen H. Long&#x27;s Expedition of 1820&quot;

The Treaty of Doak&#x27;s Stand in 1820, made the Canadian River the northern boundary of the Choctaw Nation. Early immigrants to California followed the south bank of the Canadian to Santa Fe. In 1845 the river was explored by Lieutenants James William Abert and William G. Peck of the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. Their journey was chronicled in the &quot;Journal of Lieutenant J.W. Abert from Bent&#x27;s Fort to St. Louis&quot;, first published in 1846.

Randolph B. Marcy commanded a military expedition to lay out a trail along the Canadian River in 1849. The trail, which was thereafter called the California Road, followed the south side of the river and was soon followed by large numbers of emigrants to California via Santa Fe, especially after the 1849 discovery of gold in California. Travel along the road was sharply curtailed during the American Civil War, as Union and Confederate forces fought for control of Indian Territory.

Lieutenant Amiel Weeks Whipple led an expedition in 1853 to find a railroad route across Indian Territory. It covered some of the same ground as that explored by Abert and Marcy. Whipple&#x27;s group provided extensive reports about the region&#x27;s flora and fauna. However, the group&#x27;s cost estimates discouraged proponents from building a railroad along the proposed route. However, the cumulative reports of Abert, Marcy, and Whipple changed public opinion about &quot;The Great American Desert&quot; and encouraged interest in developing the region.

In 1890, when Oklahoma Territory was proclaimed, the river formed part of the boundary between Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory. This boundary was eradicated when the State of Oklahoma was created in 1907.

==Course==
The river rises on the east side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, around above sea level, in remote southwestern Las Animas County, Colorado, roughly north of the New Mexico border. An upper tributary of the Vermejo River heads around in elevation in the Culebra Range and has a confluence with the Canadian south of Maxwell, New Mexico. Overall, the meandering course is from its origin to its confluence with the Arkansas River. The main tributaries are the North Canadian, Little, and Deep Fork Rivers.

After rising in Colorado, the Canadian flows east-southeast across the New Mexico border, then south, passing west of Raton, New Mexico. It forms a deep canyon south of Springer, New Mexico. The Sabinoso Wilderness area is located in side canyons near the river. At its first dam at Conchas Lake, the river turns eastward. It is also dammed at Logan, New Mexico, where it forms Ute Lake. From there it crosses the Texas Panhandle, dammed at Sanford, Texas, where it forms Lake Meredith. The canyon the river carves through eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle is the northern border of the Llano Estacado, separating it from the rest of the Great Plains. From Texas, the Canadian continues eastward into Oklahoma, passing just south of Oklahoma City. At Eufaula, Oklahoma, it flows into Eufaula Lake, the largest on this river. About downstream, it joins the Arkansas River at Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, around west of the Arkansas border.

For most of its length, the Canadian is a slow-moving waterway bounded by red mud flats and quicksand. When sufficient rain has fallen, the river can carry substantial amounts of water. The river is now under the control of the Canadian River Commission.

<text>The paddyfield pipit or Oriental pipit (Anthus rufulus) is a small passerine bird in the pipit and wagtail family. It is a resident (non-migratory) breeder in open scrub, grassland and cultivation in southern Asia east to the Philippines. Although among the few breeding pipits in the Asian region, identification becomes difficult in winter when several other species migrate into the region. The taxonomy of the species is complex and has undergone considerable changes.

==Description==

This is a large pipit at 15 cm, but is otherwise an undistinguished looking bird, mainly streaked grey-brown above and pale below with breast streaking. It is long legged with a long tail and a long dark bill. Sexes are similar. Summer and winter plumages are similar. Young birds are more richly coloured below than adults and have the pale edges to the feathers of the upper parts more conspicuous with more prominent spotting on the breast. The population &quot;waitei&quot; from north-western India and Pakistan is pale while the population &quot;malayensis&quot; from the Western Ghats is larger, darker and more heavily streaked with the nominate &quot;rufulus&quot; intermediate.

In winter some care must be taken to distinguish this from other pipits that winter in the area, such as Richard&#x27;s pipit, &quot;Anthus richardi&quot; and Blyth&#x27;s pipit, &quot;Anthus godlewskii&quot;. The paddyfield pipit is smaller and dumpier, has a shorter looking tail and has weaker fluttering flight. The usually uttered characteristic &quot;chip-chip-chip&quot; call is quite different from usual calls of Richard&#x27;s pipit (an explosive &#x27;) and Blyth&#x27;s pipit (a nasal &#x27;). The tawny pipit has less streaking on the mantle and has a black loreal stripe and a longer tail. The Western Ghats population can appear very similar to the Nilgiri pipit.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Some of the subspecies in the group were formerly treated as a subspecies of the Australasian pipit &quot;Anthus novaeseelandiae&quot; and the grouping has been in state of flux. Considerable colour and morphological variation with age and latitude make the species difficult to identify from museum specimens. Six subspecies are now included in this species.
* &quot;rufulus&quot; described by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1818 – found in most of Indian Subcontinent (except for the north-west, north and extreme south-west) east to southern China, south to southern Thailand and Indochina
* &quot;waitei&quot; described by Hugh Whistler in 1936 (not always recognized) is found in the dry zone of the north-western part of the Indian Subcontinent
* &quot;malayensis&quot; described by Thomas Campbell Eyton in 1839 is the dark form of the wet zone of the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka
* &quot;lugubris&quot; described by Viscount Walden in 1875 – found in Philippines; possibly also northern Borneo.
* &quot;albidus&quot; described by Erwin Stresemann in 1912 – found in Sulawesi, Bali and the western Lesser Sundas (Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Padar, Rinca, Flores, Sumba).
* &quot;medius&quot; described by Wallace in 1864 – found in the eastern Lesser Sundas (Sawu, Roti, Timor, Kisar, Leti, Moa, Sermata).

Some authorities consider paddyfield pipit to be a subspecies of Richard&#x27;s pipit, &quot;A. richardi&quot;.

==Behaviour and ecology==
A widespread species found in open habitats, especially short grassland and cultivation with open bare ground. It runs rapidly on the ground, and when flushed, does not fly far.

The paddyfield pipit breeds throughout the year but mainly in the dry season. Birds may have two or more broods in a year. During the breeding season, it sings by repeating a note during its descent from a short fluttery flight, a few feet above the ground. It builds its nest on the ground under a slight prominence, a tuft of grass, or at the edge of a bush. The nests are woven out of grass and leaves and are normally cup shaped. Exposed nests are sometimes domed or semi-domed, the long grass at the back and sides extending over the top. Nests are lined with finer grass or roots and sometimes with a little dry moss, bracken or other material at the base of the nest. The usual clutch is three or four eggs with greenish ground colour and numerous small brown specks at the larger end. When disturbed near the nest, the birds flutter nearby with weak &quot;tsip-tsip-tsip&quot; calls. Parent birds may also feign injury to distract predators. Mites are known to cause scaly leg lesions. It feeds principally on small insects but consumes larger beetles, tiny snails, worms etc. while walking on the ground, and may pursue insects like mosquitoes or termites in the air.

A species of &quot;Haemoproteus&quot;, &quot;H. anthi&quot;, has been described from this species.

<doc id="617167" wikidata="Q1470609" url="?curid=617167" title="Piphilology">
<text>Piphilology comprises the creation and use of mnemonic techniques to remember many digits of the mathematical constant . The word is a play on the word &quot;pi&quot; itself and of the linguistic field of philology.

There are many ways to memorize , including the use of &quot;piems&quot; (a portmanteau, formed by combining pi and poem), which are poems that represent in a way such that the length of each word (in letters) represents a digit. Here is an example of a piem: &quot;Now I need a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics.&quot; Notice how the first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. In longer examples, 10-letter words are used to represent the digit zero, and this rule is extended to handle repeated digits in so-called Pilish writing. The short story &quot;Cadaeic Cadenza&quot; records the first 3,834 digits of in this manner, and a 10,000-word novel, &quot;Not A Wake&quot;, has been written accordingly.

However, poems prove to be inefficient for large memorizations of . Other methods include remembering patterns in the numbers (for instance, the year 1971 appears in the first fifty digits of ) and the method of loci (which has been used to memorize to 67,890 digits).

==History==
Until the 20th century, the number of digits of pi which mathematicians had the stamina to calculate by hand remained in the hundreds, so that memorization of &quot;all&quot; known digits at the time was possible. In 1949 a computer was used to calculate π to 2,000 places, presenting one of the earliest opportunities for a more difficult challenge.

Later computers calculated pi to extraordinary numbers of digits (2.7 trillion as of August 2010), and people began memorizing more and more of the output. The world record for the number of digits memorized has exploded since the mid-1990s, and it stood at 100,000 as of October 2006. The previous record (83,431) was set by the same person (Akira Haraguchi) on July 2, 2005, and the record previous to that (42,195) was held by Hiroyuki Goto.
An institution from Germany provides the details of the &quot;Pi World Ranking&quot;.

==Examples in English==
The most common mnemonic technique is to memorize a so-called &quot;piem&quot; (a wordplay on &quot;pi&quot; and &quot;poem&quot;) in which the number of letters in each word is equal to the corresponding digit of π. This famous example for 15 digits has several variations, including:

:&quot;How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy chapters involving quantum mechanics!&quot; - Sir James Hopwood Jeans

Short mnemonics such as these, of course, do not take one very far down π&#x27;s infinite road. Instead, they are intended more as amusing doggerel. If even less accuracy suffices, the following examples can be used:

:&quot;How I wish I could recollect pi easily today!&quot;
:&quot;May I have a large container of coffee, cream and sugar?&quot;

This second one gives the value of π as 3.1415926535, while the first only brings it to the second five. Indeed, many published poems use truncation instead of one of the several roundings, thereby producing a less-accurate result when the first omitted digit is greater than or equal to five. It is advantageous to use truncation in memorizing if the individual intends to study more places later on, otherwise one will be remembering erroneous digits.

Another mnemonic is:
: &quot;The point I said a blind Bulgarian in France could see&quot;
In this mnemonic the word &quot;point&quot; represents the decimal point itself.

Yet another example is:
:&quot;How I wish I could recollect, of circle round, the exact relation Arkimedes (or Archimede) unwound.&quot;
In this example, the spelling of Archimedes is normalised to nine. Although &#x27;Archimedes&#x27; is, today, a more correct spelling of the ancient Greek mathematician&#x27;s name in English, Archimede is also often seen when this mnemonic is given, since Archimède is the more correct spelling in some languages, such as French. This mnemonic also contains a rounding error because the digit represented by the last word &quot;Arkimedes&quot; (9) in 3.141592653589 is followed by 7 in π, which would cause the last two digits to round up.

Longer mnemonics employ the same concept. This example created by Peter M. Brigham incorporates twenty decimal digits:
:&quot;How I wish I could enumerate pi easily, since all these bullshit mnemonics prevent recalling any of pi&#x27;s sequence more simply.&quot;

===Poems===
Some mnemonics, such as this poem which gives the three and the first 20 decimal digits, use the separation of the poem&#x27;s title and main body to represent the decimal point:
: &quot;Pie&quot;
: &quot;I wish I could determine pi&quot;
: &quot;Eureka, cried the great inventor&quot;
: &quot;Christmas pudding, Christmas pie&quot;
: &quot;Is the problem&#x27;s very center.&quot;

Another, more poetic version is:
:&quot;Sir, I have a rhyme excelling,&quot;
:&quot;In mystic power and magic spelling,&quot;
:&quot;Celestial spirits elucidate,&quot;
:&quot;For my own problems can&#x27;t relate.&quot;

Extensions to 30 or 31 decimals of the same proceed as follows:
There are minor variations on the above rhyme, which still allow pi to be worked out correctly. However, one variation replaces the word &quot;lexicon&#x27;s&quot; with &quot;lesson&#x27;s&quot; and in doing so, incorrectly indicates that the 18th digit is seven.

The logologist Dmitri Borgmann gives the following 30-word poem in his book, &quot;Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities&quot;: 
:&quot;Now, a moon, a lover refulgent in flight,&quot;
:&quot;Sails the black silence&#x27;s loneliest ellipse.&quot;
:&quot;Computers use pi, the constant, when polite,&quot;
:&quot;Or gentle data for sad tracking aid at eclipse.&quot;

In the fantasy book, &quot;Somewhen&quot; by David Saul, a 35-word piem both provides a description of the constant pi and the digits. The text is also laid out as a circle to provide another clue to the readers as to the purpose of the poem. In this example, the word &quot;nothing&quot; is used to represent the digit zero. 

:&quot;It&#x27;s a fact&quot;
:&quot;A ratio immutable&quot;
:&quot;Of circle round and width,&quot;
:&quot;Produces geometry&#x27;s deepest conundrum.&quot;
:&quot;For as the numerals stay random,&quot;
:&quot;No repeat lets out its presence,&quot;
:&quot;Yet it forever stretches forth.&quot;
:&quot;Nothing to eternity.&quot;

The following sonnet is a mnemonic for pi to 75 decimal places in iambic pentameter:

:&quot;Now I defy a tenet gallantly&quot;
:&quot;Of circle canon law: these integers&quot;
:&quot;Importing circles&#x27; quotients are, we see,&quot;
:&quot;Unwieldy long series of cockle burs&quot;

:&quot;Put all together, get no clarity;&quot;
:&quot;Mnemonics shan&#x27;t describeth so reformed&quot;
:&quot;Creating, with a grammercy plainly,&quot;
:&quot;A sonnet liberated yet conformed.&quot;

:&quot;Strangely, the queer&#x27;st rules I manipulate&quot;
:&quot;Being followéd, do facilitate&quot;
:&quot;Whimsical musings from geometric bard.&quot;

:&quot;This poesy, unabashed as it&#x27;s distressed,&quot;
:&quot;Evolvéd coherent - a simple test,&quot;
:&quot;Discov&#x27;ring poetry no numerals jarred.&quot;

Note that in this example, 10-letter words are used to represent the digit zero.

Other poems use sound as a mnemonic technique, as in the following poem which rhymes with the first 140 decimal places of pi using a blend of assonance, slant rhyme, and perfect rhyme:
:&quot;dreams number us like pi. runes shift. nights rewind&quot;
:&quot;daytime pleasure-piles. dream-looms create our id.&quot;
:&quot;moods shift. words deviate. needs brew. pleasures rise.&quot;
:&quot;time slows. too late? wait! foreign minds live in&quot;

:&quot;us! quick-minds, free-minds, minds-we-never-mind,&quot;
:&quot;unknown, gyrate! neuro-rhymes measure our &quot;
:&quot;minds, for our minds rhyme. crude ego-emanations&quot;
:&quot;distort nodes. id, (whose basic neuro-spacetime rhymes),&quot;

:&quot;plays its tune. space drones before fate unites&quot;
:&quot;dreams’ lore to unsung measures. whole dimensions&quot;
:&quot;gyrate. new number-games donate quick minds &amp;&quot;
:&quot;weave through fate’s loom. fears, hopes, digits, or devils&quot;

:&quot;collide here—labor stored in gold-mines, lives, lightcone-&quot;
:&quot;piles. fate loops through dreams &amp; pleasure-looms….&quot;
Note that &quot;dreams number us like pi&quot; corresponds to &quot;314159&quot;, &quot;runes shift&quot; corresponds to &quot;26&quot;, &quot;nights rewind&quot; corresponds to &quot;535&quot; and so on. Sound-based mnemonic techniques, unlike pilish, do not require that the letters in each word be counted in order to recall the digits of pi. However, where sound-based mnemonics use assonance, extra care must be taken to distinguish &quot;nine&quot; and &quot;five,&quot; which contain the same vowel sound. In this example, the author assumes the convention that zero is often called &quot;O.&quot;

===Piku===

The age follows the rules of conventional

:&quot;How I love a verse&quot;
:&quot;Contrived to unhusk dryly&quot;
:&quot;One image nutshell&quot;

===Songs===
In 2004, Andrew Huang wrote a song that was a mnemonic for the first fifty digits of pi, titled &quot;I am the first 50 digits of pi&quot;. The first line is:
:&quot;Man, I can’t - I shan’t! - formulate an anthem where the words comprise mnemonics, dreaded mnemonics for pi.&quot;
In 2013, Huang extended the song to include the first 100 digits of pi, and changed the title to &quot;Pi Mnemonic Song&quot;.

===Lengthier works===
There are piphilologists who have written texts that encode hundreds or thousands of digits. This is an example of constrained writing, known as &quot;Pilish&quot;. For example, &quot;Poe, E.: Near a Raven&quot; represents 740 digits, &quot;Cadaeic Cadenza&quot; encodes 3,835, and &quot;Not A Wake&quot; extends to 10,000 digits.

===Sound-based mnemonics===
It is also possible to use the rhythm and sound of the spoken digits themselves as a memorization device. The mathematician John Horton Conway composed the following arrangement for the first 100 digits,
 _ _ _
 3 point 1415 9265 35
 _ _ _ _ _ _ __
 8979 3238 4626 4338 3279
 . _ _ __ _ _ _ . _ .
 502 884 197 169 399 375 105 820 974 944
 59230 78164
 _ _ _ _
 0628 6208 998 6280
 .. _ .._
 34825 34211 70679,

where the accents indicate various kinds of repetition.

Another mnemonic system used commonly in the memorization of pi is the Mnemonic major system, where single numbers are translated into basic sounds. A combination of these sounds creates a word, which can then be translated back into numbers. When combined with the Method of loci, this becomes a very powerful memorization tool.
==Examples in other languages==
===Albanian===
===Armenian===
(10 decimal places)
===Chinese===

It is possible to construct piphilogical poems in Chinese by using homophones or near-homophones of the numbers zero through nine, as in the following well known example which covers 22 decimal places of π. In this example the character meaning &quot;mountain&quot; (山 &quot;shān&quot;) is used to represent the number &quot;three&quot; (三 &quot;sān&quot;), the character meaning &quot;I&quot; (吾 &quot;wú&quot;) is used to represent the number &quot;five&quot; (五 &quot;wǔ&quot;), and the characters meaning &quot;temple&quot; (寺 &quot;sì&quot;) and &quot;die&quot; (死 &quot;sǐ&quot;) are used to represent the number &quot;four&quot; (四 &quot;sì&quot;). Some of the mnemonic characters used in this poem, for example &quot;kill&quot; (殺 &quot;shā&quot;) for &quot;three&quot; (三 &quot;sān&quot;), &quot;jug&quot; (壺 &quot;hú&quot;) for &quot;five&quot; (五 &quot;wǔ&quot;), &quot;happiness&quot; (樂 &quot;lè&quot;) for &quot;six&quot; (六 &quot;liù&quot;) and &quot;eat&quot; (吃 &quot;chī&quot;) for &quot;seven&quot; (七 &quot;qī&quot;), are not very close phonetically in Mandarin/Putonghua.

This can be translated as:

:&quot;On a mountain top a temple and a jug of wine.&quot;
:&quot;Your happiness makes me so bitter;&quot;
:&quot;Take some wine and drink, the wine will kill you;&quot;
:&quot;If it does not kill you, I will rejoice in your happiness.&quot;

===Czech===
(nine decimal places) 
(12 decimal places)
(13 decimal places)
(30 decimal places)
===French===
The following poem composed of alexandrines consists of words each with a number of letters that yields π to 126 decimal places:
An alternative beginning:
:Que j’aime à faire apprendre un nombre utile aux sages !
:Glorieux Archimède, artiste ingénieur,
:Toi de qui Syracuse aime encore la gloire,
:Soit ton nom conservé par de savants grimoires !

===German===
This statement yields π to twenty-two decimal places:
:Wie, o dies π macht ernstlich so vielen viele Müh. Lernt immerhin, Mägdelein, leichte Verselein, wie so zum Beispiel dies dürfte zu merken sein.

English translation that does not encode pi:
:How, oh this π seriously makes so many struggles to so many. Learn at least, girls, simple little verses, just such as this one should be memorizable.

Looser English translation that encodes pi:
:Woe! O this π makes seriously so muchly many&#x27;s woe.

===Hungarian===
An interesting (not math themed) alternative:
Another alternative:
:Íme a szám: a görög periféria pi betűje.
:Euler meg Viète végtelen összeggel közelít értékéhez.
:Lám, őt már Egyiptom, Kína, Európa is akarta, hogy
:„ama kör kerülete úgy ki lehetne számlálva”.

===Irish===
(7 decimal places)
===Italian===
(30 decimal places)
(10 decimal places)
Chi è nudo e crepa limonando la tubera, lieto lui crepa

===Japanese===
Japanese piphilology has countless mnemonics based on punning words with numbers. This is especially easy in Japanese because there are two or three ways to pronounce each digit, and the language has relatively few phonemes to begin with. For example, to 31 decimal places:

This is close to being ungrammatical nonsense, but a loose translation prioritizing word order yields:

:&quot;A person is one; the world is one:&quot;
:&quot;to live this way, it&#x27;s meaningless, one says, and cries,&quot;
:&quot;&quot;step on it, will ya!&quot; then reads—be the same!&quot;
:&quot;Crying uncontrollably in the dark.&quot;

Japanese children also use songs built on this principle to memorize the multiplication table.

===Katharevousa (archaizing) Greek===

Yielding π to 22 decimal places:

===Persian===
Counting the letters in each word (additionally separated by &quot;|&quot;) gives 10 decimal places of : خرد (kherad) = 3, و (va) = 1, دانش (daanesh) = 4, و (va) = 1, آگاهی (aagaahi) = 5, ...

===Polish===
The verse of Polish mathematician Witold Rybczyński (35 decimal places): 

(Note that the dash stands for zero.)

The verse of Polish mathematician Kazimierz Cwojdziński (23 decimal places):
(12 decimal places):
(10 decimal places)
An occasionally seen verse related to Mundial Argentina and the Polish football team (30 decimal places):
===Portuguese===
(11 decimal places)
(8 decimal places)
Or in Brazilian Portuguese: 
A poem written in a more poetic manner:
===Romanian===
One of the Romanian versions of Pi poems is:
There is another phrase known in Romanian that will help to memorize the number by eight decimal places:
&quot;Așa e bine a scrie renumitul și utilul număr.&quot; — &quot;This is the way to write the renowned and useful number.&quot;

Another alternative for 15 decimal places: &quot;Ion a luat o carte, biografie, în latina veche. Are cinci capitole originale clasice latinești. —&quot; &quot;Ion has bought a book, a biography, in old latin. It has five classical original latin chapters.&quot;

===Russian===
In the Russian language, there is a well-known phrase in the reform of 1917 orthography of old tradition:
A more modern rhyme is:
A short approximation is: &quot;Что я знаю о кругах?&quot; (What do I know about circles?)

In addition, there are several nonfolklore verses that simply rhyme the digits of pi &quot;as is&quot;; for examples, see the Russian version of this article.

===Sanskrit===

The Katapayadi System of verses is basically a system of code so that things can be defined in a way so that people can remember. The code is as follows:

With the above key in place, Sri Bharathi Krishna Tirtha in his Vedic Mathematics gives the following verse:

गोपी भाग्य मधुव्रात श्रुङ्गिशो दधिसन्धिग &lt;br&gt;
खलजीवित खाताव गलहालारसंधार

If we replace the code from the above table in the above verse, here is what we get.

31 41 5926 535 89793 &lt;br&gt;
23846 264 33832792

That gives us π/10=0.31415926535897932384626433832792 

===Serbian===
(16 decimal places)
===Slovene===
The following poem gives π to 30 decimal places.
===Spanish===
The following poem, giving π to 31 decimal places, is well known in Argentina:
Another. This piem gives π (correctly rounded) to 10 decimal places. (If you prefer to not round π, then replace &quot;cosmos&quot; with &quot;cielo&quot;.)

==Memorization record holders==

Even before computers calculated , memorizing a record number of digits became an obsession for some people. The record for memorizing digits of , certified by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, is 70,000 digits, recited in India by Rajveer Meena in 9 hours and 27 minutes on 21 March 2015. On October 3, 2006, Akira Haraguchi, a retired Japanese engineer, claimed to have recited 100,000 decimal places, but the claim was not verified by Guinness World Records.

David Fiore was an early record holder for pi memorization. Fiore&#x27;s record stood as an American record for more than 27 years, which remains the longest time period for an American recordholder. He was the first person to break the 10,000 digit mark.

Suresh Kumar Sharma holds Limca Book&#x27;s record for the most decimal places of pi recited by memory. He rattled off 70,030 numbers in 17 hours 14 minutes on October 21, 2015.

<doc id="617169" wikidata="Q865913" url="?curid=617169" title="Edo Castle">
<text>is a flatland castle that was built in 1457 by Ōta Dōkan in Edo, Toshima District, Musashi Province. In modern times it is part of the Tokyo Imperial Palace in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and is therefore also known as .
Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Tokugawa shogunate there, and it was the residence of the &quot;shōgun&quot; and the headquarters of the military government during the Edo period (1603–1867) in Japanese history. After the resignation of the &quot;shōgun&quot; and the Meiji Restoration, it became the Tokyo Imperial Palace. Some moats, walls and ramparts of the castle survive to this day. However, the grounds were more extensive during the Edo period, with Tokyo Station and the Marunouchi section of the city lying within the outermost moat. It also encompassed Kitanomaru Park, the Nippon Budokan Hall and other current landmarks of the surrounding area.

== History ==

The warrior Edo Shigetsugu built his residence in what is now the &quot;Honmaru&quot; and &quot;Ninomaru&quot; part of Edo Castle, around the end of the Heian period (794–1185) or beginning of the Kamakura period (1185–1333). The Edo clan left in the 15th century as a result of uprisings in the Kantō region, and Ōta Dōkan, a retainer of the Ogigayatsu Uesugi family, built Edo Castle in 1457.

The castle came under the control of the Later Hōjō clan in 1524 after the Siege of Edo. The castle was vacated in 1590 due to the Siege of Odawara. Tokugawa Ieyasu made Edo Castle his base after he was offered eight eastern provinces by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He later defeated Toyotomi Hideyori, son of Hideyoshi, at the Siege of Osaka in 1615, and emerged as the political leader of Japan. Tokugawa Ieyasu received the title of &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot; in 1603, and Edo became the center of Tokugawa&#x27;s administration.

Initially, parts of the area were lying under water. The sea reached the present &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; area of Edo Castle, and Hibiya was a beach. The landscape was changed for the construction of the castle. Most construction started in 1593 and was completed in 1636 under Ieyasu&#x27;s grandson, Tokugawa Iemitsu. By this time, Edo had a population of 150,000.

The existing &quot;Honmaru&quot;, &quot;Ninomaru&quot;, and &quot;Sannomaru&quot; areas were extended with the addition of the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot;, &quot;Nishinomaru-shita&quot;, &quot;Fukiage&quot;, and &quot;Kitanomaru&quot; areas. The perimeter measured 16 km.

The &quot;shōgun&quot; required the &quot;daimyō&quot;s to supply building materials or finances, a method shogunate used to keep the powers of the &quot;daimyō&quot;s in check. Large granite stones were moved from afar, the size and number of the stones depended on the wealth of the &quot;daimyō&quot;s. The wealthier ones had to contribute more. Those who did not supply stones were required to contribute labor for such tasks as digging the large moats and flattening hills. The earth that was taken from the moats was used as landfill for sea-reclamation or to level the ground. Thus the construction of Edo Castle laid the foundation for parts of the city where merchants were able to settle.

At least 10,000 men were involved in the first phase of the construction and more than 300,000 in the middle phase. When construction ended, the castle had 38 gates. The ramparts were almost high and the outer walls were high. Moats forming roughly concentric circles were dug for further protection. Some moats reached as far as Ichigaya and Yotsuya, and parts of the ramparts survive to this day. This area is bordered by either the sea or the Kanda River, allowing ships access.

Various fires over the centuries damaged or destroyed parts of the castle, Edo and the majority of its buildings being made of timber.

On April 21, 1701, in the Great Pine Corridor (&quot;Matsu no Ōrōka&quot;) of Edo Castle, Asano Takumi-no-kami drew his short sword and attempted to kill Kira Kōzuke-no-suke for insulting him. This triggered the events involving the forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot;.
After the capitulation of the shogunate in 1867, the inhabitants and &quot;shōgun&quot; had to vacate the premises. The castle compound was renamed in October, 1868, and then renamed in 1869. In the year Meiji 2 (1868), on the 23rd day of the 10th month of the Japanese calendar the emperor moved to Tokyo and Edo castle became an imperial palace.

A fire consumed the old Edo Castle on the night of May 5, 1873. The area around the old keep, which burned in the 1657 Meireki fire, became the site of the new Imperial , built in 1888. Some Tokugawa-period buildings which were still standing were destroyed to make space for new structures for the imperial government. The imperial palace building itself, however, was constructed in &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; Ward, not in the same location as the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s palace in &quot;Honmaru&quot; Ward.

The site suffered substantial damage during World War II and in the destruction of Tokyo in 1945.

Today the site is part of the Tokyo Imperial Palace. The government declared the area an historic site and has undertaken steps to restore and preserve the remaining structures of Edo Castle.

== Appearance of Edo Castle ==
The plan of Edo Castle was not only large but elaborate. The grounds were divided into various wards, or citadels. The &quot;Honmaru&quot; was in the center, with the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; (second compound), &quot;Sannomaru&quot; (third compound) extending to the east; the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; (west compound) flanked by &quot;Nishinomaru-shita&quot; (outer section) and &quot;Fukiage&quot; (firebreak compound); and the &quot;Kitanomaru&quot; (north compound). The different wards were divided by moats and large stone walls, on which various keeps, defense houses and towers were built. To the east, beyond the &quot;Sannomaru&quot; was an outer moat, enclosing the &quot;Otomachi&quot; and &quot;Daimyō-Kōji&quot; districts.
&quot;Ishigaki&quot; stone walls were constructed around the &quot;Honmaru&quot; and the eastern side of the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot;. Each ward could be reached via wooden bridges, which were buffered by gates on either side. The circumference is subject to debate, with estimates ranging from 6 to 10 miles.

With the enforcement of the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system in the 17th century, it became expedient for the &quot;daimyōs&quot; to set up residence in Edo close to the &quot;shōgun&quot;. Surrounding the inner compounds of the castle were the residences of &quot;daimyōs&quot;, most of which were concentrated at the Outer Sakurada Gate to the south-east and in the &quot;Ōtemachi&quot; and &quot;Daimyō-Kōji&quot; districts east of the castle inside the outer moat. Some residences were also within the inner moats in the outer &quot;Nishinomaru&quot;.

The mansions were large and very elaborate, with no expenses spared to construct palaces with Japanese gardens and multiple gates. Each block had four to six of the mansions, which were surrounded by ditches for drainage. &quot;Daimyōs&quot; with lesser wealth were allowed to set up their houses, called &quot;banchō&quot;, to the north and west of the castle.

To the east and south of the castle were sections that were set aside for merchants, since this area was considered unsuitable for residences. The entertainment district Yoshiwara was also there.

=== Gates ===
Edo Castle was protected by multiple large and small wooden gates (&quot;mon&quot;), constructed in-between the gaps of the stone wall. There were 36 major gates. Not many are left on the outer moats, because they were a traffic hazard. Since the central quarter is now Tokyo Imperial Palace, some gates on the inner moats are well maintained and used as security check points. 

In old days, &quot;Ote-mon&quot; was the main gate and the most heavily armed. There were 3 more gates you would go through after &quot;Ote-mon&quot; to reach the Shogun&#x27;s residence. Today, &quot;Nishinomaru-mon&quot; is the main entrance to the Palace. However, the twin bridge &quot;Nijubashi&quot; in front of it is more famous than the gate itself, thus the Palace Entrance is often publicly referred to as &quot;Nijubashi&quot;.

An eye-witness account is given by the French director François Caron from the Dutch colony at Dejima. He described the gates and courts being laid out in such a manner as to confuse an outsider. Caron noted the gates were not placed in a straight line, but were staggered, forcing a person to make a 90 degree turn to pass on to the next gate. This style of construction for the main gates is called &quot;masugata&quot; (meaning &quot;square&quot;). As noted by Caron, the gate consisted of a square-shaped courtyard or enclosure and a two-story gatehouse which is entered via three roofed &quot;kōrai-mon&quot;. The &quot;watari-yagura-mon&quot; was constructed at adjacent angles to each side within the gate. All major gates had large timbers that framed the main entry point and were constructed to impress and proclaim the might of the shogunate.

=== Garrison ===
Accounts of how many armed men served at Edo Castle vary. The Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines Rodrigo de Vivero y Velasco gave an eye-witness account in 1608–1609, describing the huge stones that made up the walls and a large number of people at the castle. He claimed to have seen 20,000 servants between the first gate and the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s palace. He passed through two ranks of 1,000 soldiers armed with muskets, and by the second gate he was escorted by 400 armed men. He passed stables that apparently had room for 200 horses and an armory that stored enough weapons for 100,000 men.

== &quot;Honmaru&quot; ==

 was the central, innermost part of the castle containing the keep and residence of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. The stately and luxurious main buildings of the &quot;Honmaru&quot;, consisting of the outer, central, and inner halls, were said to have covered an area of during the Kan-ei era (1624–1644). Surrounding the &quot;Honmaru&quot; were curtain walls, with 11 keeps, 15 defense houses and more than 20 gates.

&quot;Honmaru&quot; was destroyed several times by fire and reconstructed after each fire. The keep and main palace were destroyed in 1657 and 1863, respectively, and not reconstructed. Some remains, such as the &quot;Fujimi-yagura&quot; keep and &quot;Fujimi-tamon&quot; defense house, still exist.

The &quot;Honmaru&quot; was surrounded by moats on all sides. To the north separating &quot;Honmaru&quot; from the &quot;Kitanomaru&quot; were the &quot;Inui-bori&quot; and &quot;Hirakawa-bori&quot;, to the east separating the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; was the &quot;Hakuchō-bori&quot;, and to the west and south separating the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; were the &quot;Hasuike-bori&quot; and &quot;Hamaguri-bori&quot;.
Most of these still exist, although the &quot;Hakuchō-bori&quot; has partly been filled in since the Meiji era.

=== &quot;Kitahanebashi-mon&quot; ===

 is the northern gate to the &quot;Honmaru&quot; ward, facing &quot;Kitanomaru&quot; ward across Daikan-cho street. It is also constructed as a &quot;masu&quot;-gate just like &quot;Ōte-mon&quot; and &quot;Hirakawa-mon&quot;, and has a &quot;watari-yagura-mon&quot; in a left angle. The bridge in front of the gate, which was once a drawbridge during the Edo period, is now fixed to the ground. The metal clasps used to draw the bridge are still attached to the roof of the gate.

=== Keep ===

The main keep or tower (known as the ) was in the northern corner of the &quot;Honmaru&quot; ward. &quot;Kitahanebashi-mon&quot; is right next to it and was one of the main gateways to this innermost part. The measurements are in width from east to west, in length from north to south, and in height. The castle once had a five-storey keep which was in height and was thus the highest castle tower in the whole of Japan, symbolizing the power of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. The first iteration of the keep and its multiple roofs were constructed in 1607 and ornamented with gold. It was rebuilt in 1623 and again in 1638. The third version of the keep was destroyed in the 1657 Fire of Meireki and not reconstructed. The foundations of the keep that survive today were built in preparation for reconstructing the keep, but were never used. 

Despite this, &quot;jidaigeki&quot; movies (such as &quot;Abarenbō Shōgun&quot;) set in Edo usually depict Edo Castle as having a keep, and substitute Himeji Castle for that purpose.

A non-profit &quot;Rebuilding Edo-jo Association&quot; (NPO江戸城再建) was founded in 2004 with the aim of a historically correct reconstruction of at least the main keep. In March 2013 Naotaka Kotake, head of the group, said that &quot;The capital city needs a symbolic building&quot;, and that the group planned to collect donations and signatures on a petition in the hope of having the tower rebuilt. A reconstruction blueprint had been made based on old documents. The Imperial Household Agency had not indicated whether it would support the project.

=== &quot;Honmaru&quot; Palace ===

The residential and the gardens of the &quot;shōgun&quot; and his court were constructed around the castle keep in the &quot;Honmaru&quot; area. It consisted of a series of low-level buildings, connected by corridors and congregating around various gardens, courtyards or lying detached, similar to the structures that can be seen in Nijō Castle in Kyoto today. These structures were used for either residential or governmental purposes such as audiences.

The &quot;Honmaru&quot; Palace was one story high, and consisted of three sections:

# The &quot;Ō-omote&quot; (Great Outer Palace) contained reception rooms for public audience and apartments for guards and officials;
# The &quot;Naka-oku&quot; (middle interior) was where the &quot;shōgun&quot; received his relatives, higher lords and met his counselors for the affairs of state; and
# &quot;Ōoku&quot; (great interior) contained the private apartments of the &quot;shōgun&quot; and his ladies-in-waiting. The great interior was strictly off-limits and communication went through young messenger boys. The great interior was apparently 1,000 tatami mats in size and could be divided into sections by the use of sliding &quot;shōji&quot; doors, which were painted in elegant schemes.

Various fires destroyed the &quot;Honmaru&quot; Palace over time and was rebuilt after each fire. In the span from 1844 to 1863, &quot;Honmaru&quot; experienced three fires. After each fire, the &quot;shōgun&quot; moved to the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; residences for the time being until reconstruction was complete. However, in 1853 both the &quot;Honmaru&quot; and &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; burned down, forcing the &quot;shōgun&quot; to move into a &quot;daimyō&quot; residence. The last fire occurred in 1873, after which the palace was not rebuilt by the new imperial government.
Behind the &quot;Honmaru&quot; Palace was the main keep. Besides being the location of the keep and palace, the &quot;Honmaru&quot; was also the site of the treasury. Three storehouses that bordered on a rampart adjoined the palace on the other side. The entrance was small, made with thick lumber and heavily guarded. Behind the wall was a deep drop to the moat below, making the area secure.

=== &quot;Fujimi-yagura&quot; ===
The stands in the south-eastern corner of the &quot;Honmaru&quot; enceinte and is three storeys high. &quot;Fujimi-yagura&quot; is one of only three remaining keeps of the inner citadel of Edo Castle, from a total number of originally eleven. The other remaining keeps are &quot;Fushimi-yagura&quot; (next to the upper steel bridge of &quot;Nijūbashi&quot;) and &quot;Tatsumi-nijyu-yagura&quot; (at the corner of &quot;Kikyō-bori&quot; moat next to &quot;Kikyō-mon&quot; gate). It is also called the &quot;all-front-sided&quot; keep because all sides look the same from all directions. It is believed that once Mount Fuji could be seen from this keep, hence the name. Since the main keep of Edo Castle was destroyed in 1657 and not reconstructed, the &quot;Fujimi-yagura&quot; took on its role and was an important building after being constructed in 1659 during the Edo period. About north of the &quot;Fujimi-yagura&quot; is the former site of the &quot;Matsu no Ōrōka&quot; corridor, scene of dramatic events in 1701 that led to the forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot; incident.

=== &quot;Fujimi-tamon&quot; ===

The defense house is about north from the &quot;Matsu no Ōrōka&quot;. This defense house sits on top of the large stone walls overlooking to the &quot;Hasuike-bori&quot; (Lotus-growing moat). Weapons and tools were stored here. During the Edo period, double and triple keeps (&quot;yagura&quot;) were constructed at strategic points on top of the stone wall surrounding the &quot;Honmaru&quot;. In between each keep, a defense house (called &quot;tamon&quot;) was erected for defensive purposes. There were once 15 of these houses in the &quot;Honmaru&quot;, of which only the &quot;Fujimi-tamon&quot; still exists.

=== &quot;Ishimuro&quot; ===

North of the &quot;Fujimi-tamon&quot; is the , on a slope. It is about . Its precise purpose is unknown, but since it is close to the former inner palace storage area, it is believed to have been used for storage of supplies and documents for the shogunate.

=== &quot;Shiomi-zaka&quot; ===
 is a slope running alongside today&#x27;s Imperial Music Department building towards &quot;Ninomaru&quot; enceinte. In old times apparently the sea could be seen from here, therefore its name.

== &quot;Ninomaru&quot; ==

At the foot of the &quot;Shiomi-zaka&quot; on the eastern side of the &quot;Honmaru&quot; lies the of Edo Castle. A palace for the heirs of the Tokugawa &quot;shōguns&quot; was constructed in 1639 in the west area (Western Perimeter) and in 1630 it is reported that a garden designed by Kobori Enshū, who was the founder of Japanese landscaping, was to its south-east. Several fires destroyed whatever stood here and it was not reconstructed. Aside from the &quot;Honmaru&quot; palace, the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; was surrounded by 7 keeps, 8 defense houses, approximately 10 gates and other guardhouses. The &quot;Tenjin-bori&quot; separates a part of the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; to the &quot;Sannomaru&quot;.

Several renovations were carried out over the years until the Meiji era. A completely new garden has been laid out since then around the old pond left from the Edo period. Only the &quot;Hyakunin-bansho&quot; and &quot;Dōshin-bansho&quot; are still standing.

=== &quot;Dōshin-bansho&quot; ===

The is a guardhouse. A big guardhouse was within the &quot;Ōte-mon&quot; where today&#x27;s security is. The passageway proceeding west from the guardhouse becomes narrower within the stone walls on both sides. The &quot;dōshin-bansho&quot; is on the right side past this passageway. This is where the samurai guardsmen were posted to watch over the castle grounds.

=== &quot;Hyakunin-bansho&quot; ===

There is a big stone wall in front of the &quot;Dōshin-bansho&quot;, which is the foundation of the &quot;Ōte-sanno-mon watari-yagura&quot; keep. The long building to the left on the southern side of this foundation is the . The &quot;Hyakunin-bansho&quot; is so called because it housed a hundred guardsmen closely associated with the Tokugawa clan.

=== &quot;Ō-bansho&quot; ===

The large stone wall in front of the &quot;Hyakunin-bansho&quot; is all that is left of the &quot;Naka-no-mon watari-yagura&quot; (Inner Gate Keep). This building to the inner-right side of the gate is the . As the &quot;Honmaru&quot; enceinte was said to begin right behind the &quot;Naka-no-mon&quot; gate, the &quot;Ō-bansho&quot; probably played a key role in the security of Edo Castle.

=== &quot;Suwa-no-Chaya&quot; ===

The is a teahouse that was once in the &quot;Fukiage&quot; garden during the Edo period. After various relocations in the Meiji era, today it is in the modern &quot;Ninomaru&quot; Garden.

== &quot;Sannomaru&quot; ==
The is the easternmost enceinte next to the &quot;Ninomaru&quot;, separated by the &quot;Tenjin-bori&quot;. Ōte-bori is to the north, running then south is &quot;Kikyō-bori&quot;.

=== &quot;Bairin-zaka&quot; ===
A steep slope, , runs from eastern &quot;Honmaru&quot; toward &quot;Hirakawa-mon&quot; in front of the today&#x27;s Archives and Mausolea Department building. It is said that Ōta Dōkan planted several hundred plum trees in 1478 in dedication to Sugawara no Michizane. Dōkan is said to have built the Sanno-Gongendō here, where two shrines were when the Tokugawa clan occupied the site. With the erection of the &quot;Honmaru&quot; of Edo Castle, the shrine dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane was moved to Kojimachi Hirakawa-chō and later became known as Hirakawa Shrine. Sanno Shrine was first moved to &quot;Momijiyama&quot; of Edo Castle and became its tutelary shrine but was moved again. Today it is known as Hie Shrine.

=== &quot;Hirakawa-mon&quot; ===

 is said to have been the main gate to the &quot;Sannomaru&quot; of Edo Castle. It is also said to have been the side gate for maidservants and therefore called the &quot;Otsubone-mon&quot;. The shape of this gate is in the &quot;masugata&quot;, similar to the &quot;Ōte-mon&quot;. However a &quot;watari-yagura-mon&quot; is built to an adjacent left angle within the &quot;kōrai-mon&quot;, of which it has two. The other &quot;kōrai-mon&quot; is to the west of the &quot;watari-yagura-mon&quot; which was used as the &quot;gates of the unclean&quot; for the deceased and criminals from within the castle. Outside this gate is a wooden bridge with railings crowned with &quot;giboshi&quot;-ornamental tops.

=== &quot;Ōte-mon&quot; ===

 was the main gate of the castle. During the reign of the second Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot; Hidetada, the castle underwent repairs in the 1620s and the gate is said to have taken its present form at this time, with the help of Date Masamune, lord of Sendai Castle, and Soma Toshitane, lord of Nakamura Castle.

A fire in Edo destroyed the &quot;Ōte-mon&quot; in January 1657, but was reconstructed in November 1658. It was severely damaged twice, in 1703 and 1855, by strong earthquakes, and reconstructed to stand until the Meiji era. Several repairs were conducted after the Meiji era, but the damage caused by the September 1923 Great Kantō earthquake lead to the dismantling of the &quot;watari-yagura&quot; (渡り櫓) and rebuilding of the stone walls on each side of the gate in 1925.

The &quot;watari-yagura&quot; was burnt down completely during World War II on April 30, 1945. Restoration took place from October 1965 through March 1967, to repair the &quot;kōrai&quot;-mon and its walls, and the &quot;Ōte-mon&quot; was reconstructed.

=== &quot;Tatsumi-yagura&quot; ===

The , also known as , is a two-story high keep at the easternmost corner of the &quot;Sannomaru&quot; and the only keep still remaining in it.

=== &quot;Kikyō-mon&quot; ===
One of the few gates left of the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; is the , which is also known as the Inner &quot;Sakurada-mon&quot;, as opposed to the (Outer) &quot;Sakurada-mon&quot; in the south. The architecture of the tower is a gate and in the &quot;kōrai&quot; style.

== &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; ==

The was the location of the palaces and residences of the retired &quot;shōgun&quot; and the heir-apparent for a while. The outer part of the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; to the east (today&#x27;s Outer Gardens of the Imperial Palace) was the site of various residences of &quot;daimyōs&quot;. The &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; is bordered by moats to the west such as the &quot;Dōkan-bori&quot;, &quot;Sakurada-bori&quot; and Gaisen-bori to the south, &quot;Kikyō-bori&quot; and &quot;Hamaguri-bori&quot; to the north. After each fire in the &quot;Honmaru&quot;, the &quot;shōgun&quot; normally moved into the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot;, although it was also destroyed by fire in 1853. On May 5, 1873, the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; residence burned down. On its site, the imperial palace was built in the Meiji era.

=== &quot;Sakurada-mon&quot; ===
Protecting the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; from the south is the large Outer . This gate is not to be confused with the Inner &quot;Sakurada-mon&quot;, also known as &quot;Kikyo-mon&quot; between &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; and &quot;Sannomaru&quot;.

=== &quot;Seimon Ishibashi&quot; and &quot;Seimon Tetsubashi&quot; ===

Two bridges led over the moats. The bridges that were once wooden and arched, were replaced with modern stone and iron cast structures in the Meiji era. The bridges were once buffered by gates on both ends, of which only the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot;-mon has survived, which is the main gate to today&#x27;s Imperial Palace.

The bridge in the foreground used to be called , while the one in the back was called .

After their replacement in the Meiji era, the bridge is now called ) and , respectively. The iron bridge is also known as , because the original wooden bridge was built on top of an auxiliary bridge due to the deepness of the moat. The stone bridge is also called because of its shape. However, both bridges are often mistakenly collectively called Nijūbashi.

Today both bridges are closed to the public except on January 2 and the Emperor&#x27;s Birthday.

=== &quot;Fushimi-yagura&quot; ===
 is a two-storey keep that still exists at the western corner leading towards the inner &quot;Nishinomaru&quot;, flanked by two galleries (&quot;tamon&quot;) on each side. It is the only keep that is left in the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot;. It comes originally from Fushimi Castle in Kyoto.

=== &quot;Sakashita-mon&quot; ===

 originally faced the north, but was changed to face the east in the Meiji era. This tower gate overlooks &quot;Hamaguri-bori&quot;. The assassination of Andō Nobumasa, a member of the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s Council of Elders, occurred outside this gate.

=== &quot;Momijiyama&quot; ===
 is an area in northern &quot;Nishinomaru&quot;. The area had shrines dedicated to former &quot;shōguns&quot; in which ceremonies were conducted in memory of them and were held regularly.

Tokugawa Ieyasu built a library in 1602 within the Fujimi of the castle with many books he obtained from an old library in Kanazawa. In July 1693, a new library was constructed at &quot;Momijiyama&quot; (&quot;Momijiyama Bunko&quot;).

The so-called &quot;Momijiyama Bunkobon&quot; are the books from that library, which are preserved in the National Archives of Japan today. This group consists chiefly of books published during the Song dynasty, Korean books that were formerly in the possession of the Kanazawa Bunko library, books presented by the Hayashi family as gifts, and fair copies of books compiled by the Tokugawa government.

== &quot;Fukiage&quot; ==
The is the western area that was made into a firebreak after the great Meireki fire of 1657. The &quot;Fukiage&quot; is encircled by the &quot;Dōkan-bori&quot; to the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; to the east, the &quot;Sakurada-bori&quot; to the south, the &quot;Hanzō-bori&quot; to the west, the &quot;Chidorigafuchi&quot; to the northwest and the &quot;Inui-bori&quot; to the north.

=== &quot;Inui-mon&quot; ===
The was in the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; area next to today&#x27;s headquarters of the Imperial Household Agency and called &quot;Nishinomaru Ura-mon&quot;. It was moved to its present location between the &quot;Kitanomaru&quot; and &quot;Fukiage&quot; garden in the Meiji era. It has its name because it was in the northwestern part of the Imperial Palace grounds.

=== &quot;Hanzōmon&quot; ===
The is a gate in the &quot;kōrai&quot; style. The old gate was destroyed by fire during World War II. The Wadakura Gate was moved here in its stead. The &quot;Hanzō-mon&quot; is the only gate to the &quot;Fukiage&quot; area from outside today.

== &quot;Kitanomaru&quot; ==

The is the northern enceinte next to the &quot;Honmaru&quot;. It was used as a medicinal garden (&quot;Ohanabatake&quot;) during the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s rule. During the 17th century, the Suruga Dainagon residence was there as well, which was used by collateral branches of the Tokugawa clan. Today this site is the location of the public Kitanomaru Park. Not much is left from the times of the Edo Castle except for two gates, &quot;Shimizu-mon&quot; and further north &quot;Tayasu-mon&quot;.

&quot;Kitanomaru&quot; is surrounded by moats. The &quot;Inui-bori&quot; and &quot;Hirakawa-bori&quot; to the south separate it from the &quot;Honmaru&quot; and &quot;Chidorigafuchi&quot; to the west.

The suburb, which is situated on 8.9 km2 of land, around the top of the 120 m high Doncaster Hill. The suburb consists of a central area along the top of Doncaster Hill, which includes several historical buildings along Doncaster Road, the Westfield Doncaster Shopping Centre and surrounding high-rise apartments, while the rest of the suburb is typical of many of Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs, with extensive low-density housing.

==Geography==


The border of the suburb follows the Koonung Creek from Doncaster Road, along the south of the suburb to Wetherby Road, which, with Victoria Street, forms the eastern border. The northern border follows Ruffey Creek, Williamsons Road, Manningham Road and Ayr Street, to the junction of the Koonung Creek and Doncaster Road.

The suburb is very hilly and due to its location it has panoramic views in every direction with the view to the west through the city stretching out to Bacchus Marsh on a clear day and the Macedon Ranges, to the north the Kinglake Ranges, to the east the Dandenong and Healesville ranges and south across the eastern suburbs to Glen Waverley/Mt Waverley.

A project to install a water recycling plant is currently planned at Tram Road Reserve.

==History==

In 1841, Frederic Unwin, a Sydney solicitor, bought of land, including most of the present suburb of Doncaster, from the Crown for one pound an acre under the terms of the short-lived Special Survey regulations. The area was sometimes known as Unwin&#x27;s Special Survey.

The Doncaster region was settled in the 1860s and 1870s, predominantly by German settler orchardists. The German community was named Waldau, but the name Doncaster gradually became commonly accepted. A Lutheran church was the first one in Doncaster in 1858. A Lutheran school opened in 1860 and a denominational school in 1861. Doncaster Post Office opened on 17 May 1860.

Schramm&#x27;s Cottage, an historic stone cottage originally located in Doncaster Road (at the site of the fountain next to the Municipal Offices), was relocated to the site of the original Lutheran Church building in Victoria Street in the 1970s. The remains of the Waldau Cemetery, where approximately 150 burials took place between 1853 and 1888, are located in the grounds of Schramm&#x27;s Cottage.

Doncaster was the location of the first electric tram to run in Melbourne in 1889. The tram started in Doncaster and ended in Box Hill (about 3.5 km away). Consequently, this was named &quot;Tram Road&quot;. However, the service did not earn any profit, so it ended in 1896 due to feuds with land holders and financial problems. The main road through the suburb, Doncaster Road, was formerly named Main Street.

Doncaster remained an orchard area until the 1970s, with the majority of houses built from the 1950s to the 1980s.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the suburb was very sought after and many famous builders chose the area along with other similar suburbs like Glen Waverly and Mt Waverley to build their project homes with some very modern designs of which several still remain though, due to redevelopment, some are disappearing.

One good example of modern design and also being of a &quot;cluster housing&quot; project is the Winter Park estate on High St.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Doncaster had a predominantly English ancestral descent population but now has a large Chinese descent population and after several years of stagnant progress, has become a boom suburb for developers.

==Traditional ownership==

The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Doncaster is located are the Wurundjeri people. The Wurundjeri people are represented by the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation.

==Demographics==

In the 2016 Census, there were 20,946 people in Doncaster. 44.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 15.8%, Malaysia 4.0%, Greece 3.4%, Hong Kong 3.0% and Italy 2.7%. 40.5% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 17.6%, Cantonese 10.1%, Greek 7.8%, Italian 3.6% and Persian 2.5%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 33.9%, Catholic 17.6% and Eastern Orthodox 10.2%.

==Transport==
The major east–west road (Doncaster Road) leads from Kew to Donvale. The Eastern Freeway terminated at Doncaster Road at the western edge of the suburb from 1983 to December 1997. The section from Bulleen Road to Doncaster Road was originally built as two lanes each way. During this period Doncaster Road carried 60,000 vehicles a day as a major arterial road. Since then, the Eastern Freeway was extended along the course of the Koonung Creek to Springvale Road.

Throughout the 1970s, the Doncaster line was planned by the State Government to run down the middle of the Eastern Freeway, with land acquired for the line, but was sold in the 1980s. Various plans have also been made for extension of the tram route 48 north to Doncaster. Today the closest railway station to Doncaster remains Box Hill railway station, three kilometres to the south.

Several bus services run in the area including routes to the CBD from the Doncaster Park and Ride bus station centre.

==Shopping==

In 1969, Westfield Doncaster was built on the corner of Doncaster and Williamsons Roads and is a well-known shopping complex in Melbourne. In the early 1980s and again in the early 1990s, it was renovated and extended. From September 2006 to October 2008, it went through a large revitalisation, improving and enlarging the centre dramatically.

==Education==

Schools located in Doncaster are:
* Doncaster Secondary College
* Birralee Primary School
* St. Gregory the Great Primary School
* Doncaster Primary School

==Sport==
The Doncaster Hockey Club was established in October 1974. The council first allowed them to start the club at Timber Ridge Reserve. It was later moved to George Street before being allowed to establish a home at Mullum Mullum Reserve where it is today. In 1985 it was the first Australian Club to have a synthetic turf. The club has had six Olympians as members: Chris Ciriello, Russell Ford, Andrew Smith, Lachlan and James Elmer and Joshua Simmonds.

The suburb has an Australian Rules football team, The Doncaster Sharks, competing in the Eastern Football League.

Doncaster Rovers SC is a Doncaster-based association football club, currently associated with Football Federation Victoria.
The Manningham Cricket Club caters for the area, playing in the Eastern Cricket Association and based at Rieschiecks Reserve, on the corner of Victoria Road and George Street.

The Doncaster Baseball Club was awarded a Diamond Award in 2008 after 10 of the 17 teams it fielded in 2007 made the finals, and three won their premiership titles. In recent years many players from the Dragons (men&#x27;s 18+ team) have gone on to play for Victoria.

Golfers formerly played at the course of the Eastern Golf Club, on Doncaster Road. The club has since relocated, with the land now being developed into a housing estate.

==Government==

Prior to 2014, Doncaster formerly had a Victorian State Parliamentary seat named after it, the Electoral district of Doncaster. It is now in the electorate of Bulleen. The current member for Bulleen is Matthew Guy. Doncaster is encompassed within the Federal Seat of Menzies and Keith Wolahan is the local member. At the municipal level, it is located within the City of Manningham.

<doc id="617172" wikidata="Q4516" url="?curid=617172" title="Lorentz National Park">
<text>Lorentz National Park is an Indonesian national park located in the provinces of Central Papua, Highland Papua and South Papua, in the southwest of western New Guinea. With an area of 25,056 km2 (9,674 mi2), it is the largest national park in Southeast Asia. In 1999 Lorentz was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

An outstanding example of the biodiversity of New Guinea, Lorentz is one of the most ecologically diverse national parks in the world. It is the only nature reserve in the Asia-Pacific region to contain a full altitudinal array of ecosystems ranging through marine areas, mangroves, tidal and freshwater swamp forest, lowland and montane rainforest, subalpine shrub and grassland, alpine tundra, and equatorial glaciers. At 4884 meters, Puncak Jaya (formerly Carstensz Pyramid) is the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.

Birdlife International has called Lorentz Park “probably the single most important reserve in New Guinea”. It contains five of World Wildlife Fund&#x27;s &quot;Global 200&quot; ecoregions: Southern New Guinea Lowland Forests; New Guinea Montane Forests; New Guinea Central Range Subalpine Grasslands; New Guinea Mangroves; and New Guinea Rivers and Streams.

Lorentz Park contains many unmapped and unexplored areas, and is certain to contain many species of plants and animals as yet unknown to Western science. Local communities&#x27; ethnobotanical and ethnozoological knowledge of the Lorentz biota is also very poorly documented.

The park is named for Hendrikus Albertus Lorentz, a Dutch explorer who passed through the area on his 1909–10 expedition.

==Birds==
Lorentz National Park has 630 documented species of bird (around 95% of the total number of bird species in Papua) and 123 mammalian species. Birds include two species of cassowary, 31 dove and pigeon species, and 60 species of kingfisher. Six bird species are endemic to the Snow Mountains including the Snow Mountain quail and Snow Mountains robin, 26 species are endemic to the Central Papuan Ranges while three are endemic to the South Papuan Lowlands. Threatened species include the southern cassowary, Alpine woolly rat, southern crowned pigeon, Pesquet&#x27;s parrot, Salvadori&#x27;s teal and Macgregor&#x27;s giant honeyeater.

The mammal species include the long-beaked echidna, short-beaked echidna, and four species of cuscus as well as wallabies, quolls and tree-kangaroos. Endemic to the Sudirman Range is the dingiso, a tree-kangaroo species only discovered in 1995.

==Human habitation and culture==
The area of the national park has been inhabited for more than 25,000 years. The forests of Lorentz encompass the traditional lands of eight indigenous ethnic groups, including the Asmat, Amung, Dani, Sempan, and Nduga. Estimates of the current population vary between 6,300 and 10,000.

It is widely acknowledged that conservation management strategies for the park will have to incorporate the needs and aspirations of these peoples if the park is to succeed in protecting biodiversity. Moreover, cultural diversity is another important measure of success for the park.

==Ecological threats==
The main threats to the biodiversity of Lorentz are from commercial logging, forest conversion for plantation agriculture, smallholder agricultural conversion, mining/oil/gas development, illegal road construction, and the illegal species trade. Global warming also poses a substantial threat.

As of 2005, there was no reported commercial logging or other large-scale threats present inside the park. There are no currently active forest conversion projects, and agricultural conversion is minimal. The illegal species trade is known to be a serious problem. The large Freeport gold/copper mining operation has been active for decades to the west and north of the park but is not active inside the park boundaries. Oil exploration inside and to the northeast of the park is ongoing.

The overall health of the biodiversity of Lorentz Park is currently excellent. While logging and other threats have yet to materialize, it is likely that this will become a threat in the future. Climate change poses a very real threat, but its specific implications for Lorentz are uncertain.

==Conservation==

The first formal protection of a 3,000 km2 core area of the Lorentz landscape was applied by the Dutch Colonial Government in 1919 with the establishment of the Lorentz Nature Monument. In 1978, the Indonesian Government established a Strict Nature Reserve with an area of 21,500 km2. Lorentz National Park was established in 1997, with a total area of 25,056 km2, including an eastern extension and coastal and marine areas.

Lorentz National Park was listed as a natural World Heritage Site in 1999, however an area of about 1,500 km2 was excluded from listing due to the presence of mining exploration titles within the park.

As of 2005, there were no park staff or guards assigned to Lorentz. However, the park&#x27;s success largely depends on local communities&#x27; understanding of and support for conservation, rather than external enforcement alone. Several conservation organizations are working in the Lorentz area.

In 2006, the Minister of Forestry established a managing structure for Lorentz National Park, the Lorentz National Park Bureau with headquarters in Wamena. The Bureau became functional only in 2007, and reached a staffing of 44 in mid-2008. However an UNESCO Monitoring Mission in 2008 acknowledged that the capacity of the Bureau was seriously limited due to lack of funding, equipment and experience.

<text>Templestowe is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 16 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Manningham local government area. Templestowe recorded a population of 16,966 at the .

The suburb has a number of natural attractions, including parklands, contrasted with large shopping malls.

==Geography==

Templestowe is located in the north-eastern area of Melbourne. Templestowe is bordered by the Yarra River, King Street, Victoria Street, Blackburn Road and some parks.

Gentle, rolling hills extend from east of the Yarra River flood plains, along Templestowe Road (towards the Eastern Freeway) for seven km (4.3 miles), to the north-east. The altitude of the plain above sea level is 50 m, and the topography is subdued and mostly flat; the hills are just below 60 m, the slopes rounded and there are several forested gullies.

Degradation of the soils in the steep slopes at the river&#x27;s edge has been exacerbated over the last century by unsustainable agricultural processes (such as the harvesting of storm-felled trees), deforestation and the introduction of rabbits. Following the 2006 drought, the community newspaper had reported several times that the population was only brought under control in 2007, 12 years after baiting programs were begun and that more conservation funding is needed to halt the loss of vegetation along the river. Most of the surrounding area has been cleared for agricultural and orchard use, although an &quot;urban forest&quot; exists in the densely populated rural-residential areas. There is a wide diversity of growth within the flood plain.

===Climate===
Most of the area corresponds to the climate recorded in Melbourne, though some variation has been recorded in the hills to the north-east. 

===Geology===
A report from &quot;The Argus&quot; in 1923 gives rare insight to interest in the area. It had been recently accepted that &quot;when the coastal plain is overweighted the back country rises&quot; due to inexorable forces moulding the surface of the Earth and the so-called &quot;Templestowe anticline&quot; was studied as representative of microscopic faulting, which accommodated this elevation of the eastern suburbs. It was observed that the new reserve grounds established along it would become a &quot;Mecca&quot; for geologists:

==History==
The land to the east of Melbourne was inhabited by the Wurundjeri people, who had lived in the Yarra River Valley and its tributaries for 40,000 years. Europeans first began to settle in the mid-1830s, and George Langhorne, a missionary in Port Phillip from 1836 to 1839, noted that a substantial monetary trade with the new settlers was &quot;well established&quot; by 1838: &quot;A considerable number of the Aboriginal people obtain food and clothing for themselves by shooting the Menura pheasant or Bullun-Bullun for the sake of the tails, which they sell to the whites.&quot; The increasingly rapid acquisition of guns, the lure of exotic foods and a societal emphasis on maintaining kin relationships meant they weren&#x27;t attracted to the mission.

In the 1850s, the Aboriginals were granted &quot;permissive occupancy&quot; of Coranderrk Station, near Healesville and forcibly resettled. According to John Green, the Inspector of Aboriginal Stations in Victoria and later manager of Corranderrk, the people were able to achieve a &quot;sustainable&quot; degree of economic independence: &quot;In the course of one week or so they will all be living in huts instead of willams [traditional housing]; they have also during that time [four months] made as many rugs, which has enabled them to buy boots, hats, coats etc., and some of them [have] even bought horses.&quot;

Around 1855, another bridge was built nearby in what is now Lower Plenty, built over the Plenty River. This bridge, made up of bluestone blocks and steel, still stands today and is part of the Plenty River Trail, close to the Heidelberg Golf Club and the Lower Plenty Hotel. It is possible that the Templestowe Bridge was similar in appearance to this.

===Founding families===

There was an early settlement of Irish and Scottish folk from the ship &quot;Midlothian&quot;, through Bulleen and Templestowe, which had arrived in June 1839. The grassland there was interspersed with large Manna and River Red (&quot;Be-al&quot;) gum trees and broken up by chains of lagoons, the largest of which, called Lake Bulleen, was surrounded by impenetrable reeds that stove off attempts to drain it for irrigation. Due to the distribution of raised ground, the flats were always flooding and for a long time only the poorest (non-English) immigrants leased &quot;pastoral&quot; land from Unwins Special Survey, the estate of the Port Phillip District Authority. Hence, although far from prosperous, the farmers living close to nature, most were &quot;independent&quot;, such that a private Presbyterian school was begun for the district in 1843.

====Pontville Homestead====
Pontville is historically and aesthetically significant amongst the early towns, as its landscape contributes to the greater understanding of 1840s agricultural and garden history, as well as for containing numerous relics of aboriginal life. The survival of its formal garden terracing and the presence Hawthorn hedgerows, used for fencing, is unusual (with an historical account from Tasmania noting the huge difficulties and costs resulting in the rarity of such plantings in the early 1800s).

The property itself (now subdivided) has several remnant plantings of the colonial era, including Himalayan Cypress, Black Mulberry and willow trees, and the land preserves the integrity of ancient scar trees, ancestral camping sites and other spirit places of the Wurundjeri aborigines. They can be observed in their original form along the trail systems, at the Tikalara (&quot;meeting place&quot;) plains tract of the Mullum-Mullum Creek.

Pontville is archaeologically important for the below ground remains inherent in the location of, and the material contained within the archaeological deposits associated with Newman&#x27;s turf hut and the subsequent homestead building, cottage, associated farm and rubbish deposits. The structures, deposits and associated artefacts are important for their potential to provide an understanding of the conditions in which a squatting family lived in the earliest days of the Port Phillip settlement.

===Namesake===

The name Templestowe was chosen when a village was proclaimed. Its exact origins are unknown, although a &quot;Templestowe&quot; is mentioned in the book &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; by Sir Walter Scott – supposedly modelled after the Temple Newsam preceptory at Leeds. As the village of Ivanhoe was settled immediately prior to Templestowe, it is believed by some that the name was chosen to preserve the literary parallel.

Templestowe Post Office opened on 1 July 1860.

===Development===
The &quot;River Peel&quot; sculpture was installed in 2001, as part of the Manningham City Gateway Sculpture Project.

Until the expansionism of the 1970s, Templestowe was scarcely populated. Additionally, it was then part of the so-called &quot;green belt&quot; of Melbourne and subdivision into less than 20,000 m2 (2 hectares) was not possible in many parts of the suburb. 

==Transport==
Templestowe lies between two of Melbourne&#x27;s suburban rail lines, (the Hurstbridge and Belgrave/Lilydale lines), which hindered the area&#x27;s development. In the 1970s, the Doncaster line was planned by the State Government to run down the middle of the Eastern Freeway, and then veer away from the freeway to run towards the suburb. However, the land acquired for the off-freeway section was sold in the 1980s.

Suburban development began in earnest in the 1970s and, while there is still no rail service, there is now a bus network operating routes to Melbourne in the west, Box Hill and Blackburn in the south, and Ringwood in the east. The service frequency is comparatively poor, with average times of an hour between buses in the off-peak, and few services running after 10pm, although there was some improvement in the late 2000s under the Victorian Government&#x27;s $1.4 billion &quot;SmartBus&quot; program.

Following the 2008 Eddington Report into improving east–west travel in the Melbourne area, which included 20 recommendations for the eastern suburban area, the professor of public transport, at Monash University, Graham Currie, gave his support to expanding the bus transit system (eight older vehicles were replaced in 2007) and argued the need for rapid-transit bus lanes throughout the City of Manningham as an alternative to developing light and heavy rail. That involves &quot;separate road space so [specialised buses] don&#x27;t have to wait in traffic or at traffic lights&quot; as a solution to road congestion, without need for the extension of tram route 48 to Doncaster Hill, favoured by the Manningham City Council.

==Education==
There are currently five state schools (Serpell, Templestowe Heights, Templestowe Park and Templestowe Valley) and two Catholic schools (Saint Charles Borromeo and Saint Kevin&#x27;s), providing primary education to the suburb. Templestowe College serves some of the demand for secondary education. However, Templestowe College, Templestowe Valley Primary School, St Kevins PS and Templestowe Heights PS are located either on the border of Templestowe and Templestowe Lower or in Templestowe Lower.

==Sport==

The suburb has an Australian Rules football team, the Templestowe Dockers, competing in the Eastern Football League. Their junior team competes in the Yarra Junior Football League.

The Bulleen Templestowe Amateur Football Club competes in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). The &quot;Bullants&quot; are a proud family club, who have had some recent premiership success at senior level (2004, 2008, 2012). The Reserves side were also Premiers in 2012, making it a very successful year for the club after building upon the success of their Under 19&#x27;s who were Premiers in 2011. The club were promoted to Division 1 of the Victorian Amateur Football Association for the 2013 season.

The suburb also had a cricket team, the Templestowe Cricket Club, competing in the Box Hill Reporter District Cricket Association. The two football clubs and the cricket club share use of the Templestowe Reserve.

Manningham United FC also has a rich history. The Templestowe located club has been around since 1965, including winning the Dockerty Cup in 1984 when they were known as Fawkner. Manningham is currently the only soccer club located in Templestowe. Although there is a club called Templestowe United, it is actually located in Bulleen.

<text>Wonga Park is a locality on the edge of Greater Melbourne, beyond the Melbourne Metropolitan Urban Growth Boundary area, north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Manningham and Maroondah and the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government areas. Wonga Park recorded a population of 3,843 at the .

Wonga Park is bounded in the west by Jumping Creek, in the north by the Yarra River, in the east by Brushy Park and Old Homestead Roads and in the south by Holloway Road.

The name comes from the Wonga Park grazing property, which itself derives from Simon Wonga, elder of the Wurundjeri indigenous people of Melbourne. The area was part of Mooroolbark until the 1890s.

==History==
Eight Hour Pioneer Settlement Post Office opened in 1902, was renamed Wonga Park around 1907 and closed in 1989. It reopened in its current location in 1994.

One of the grazing properties, Yarra Brae, was acquired by the Lord Clifford in 1942. He made part of it available for Australia&#x27;s first Pan Pacific Scout Jamboree in 1948. Clifford Park hosted another Jamboree in 1955 and is now a major Scout campsite, available for use by non-Scouting organisations as well.

In 1972, Yarra Brae was the site of a proposed Lower Yarra River Reservoir, but residents of the nearby Bend of Isles bushland estate persuaded the Victorian Government to abandon the proposal.

The residential development of Wonga Park came after the subdivisions in Croydon and Mooroolbark, which were on the Maroondah Highway and a railway line. Residential living is most concentrated around the old village settlement where the church, hall, sports facilities, fire station and local shops are found.

The northern boundary of Wonga Park, where land was acquired for the Yarra Brae storage, is a linear riverside part of the Warrandyte State Park. Wonga Park is also home to the largest residential block of land within metropolitan Melbourne, with many of the residential blocks being large in size, creating a private sanctuary for many of its residents. John Farnham resides in Wonga Park, as does V8 Supercar driver Garth Tander.

==Local Services and Shopping Village==
Wonga Park shopping village used to have a number of shops including a newsagent, bakery, supermarket, hairdresser and fish &amp; chip takeaway. As at September 2021, the shopping village is being refurbished and is expected to open in late 2022.

An IGA supermarket and Saam Saii Thai restaurant are located on Jumping Creek Rd, Wonga Park.

A general store with fuel and a post office are located in Wonga Park South.

Wonga Park is served by Country Fire Authority (CFA) volunteers.

==Activities==
Wonga Park is a scenic town with bushland and farm views. Bushwalking and river activities are available.

Wonga Park has a tennis club, a cricket club, a golf course, a soccer club (Wonga Wizards FC) and numerous horse riding clubs. With the Yarra River being so close, canoeing is also a popular activity. The Clifford Park Scout Camp is also located in Wonga Park.

Wonga Park hosts a farmers&#x27; market on the fourth Saturday of the month. It offers local foods and produce, craft, plants, music and children’s activities. The market is held at the Wonga Park Primary School.

The Kellybrook Winery is an established Yarra Valley winery located on Fulford Rd Wonga Park. It has a cellar door for wine tastings, occasional live music and an annual cider festival in autumn.

<doc id="617177" wikidata="Q5694307" url="?curid=617177" title="Heathmont, Victoria">
<text>Heathmont is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Maroondah local government area. Heathmont recorded a population of 9,933 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Heathmont was originally covered by hedge-to-hedge apple orchards. The name appears to have come from the rising land in the area having heath or low, shrub-like vegetation on it. The first shop opened in 1923 in front of a house. The population has grown from 600 people in 1953 to 8,787 people in 2001.

Heathmont Post Office opened on 15 February 1929, sometime after the railway station opened in 1926.

Heathmont was originally within the municipality of the City of Ringwood, but it became part of Maroondah City Council in December 1994.

==Public transport==

Heathmont railway station is located just off Canterbury Road (which runs through the heart of the suburb) and is on the Belgrave railway line. It is within ticketing Zone 2.

Ventura bus route 679, which runs from Chirnside Park to Ringwood Station via Lilydale, Mount Evelyn and along Canterbury Road, Great Ryrie St and Bedford Road, serves much of Heathmont.

==Shopping==

The Heathmont Shopping Centre provides services to the suburb. It includes a handful of cafes, an IGA Supermarket, butcher shop, two bakeries, a newsagent, takeaway shops, multiple hairdressers, several massage parlours, a funeral parlour, a car wash and a post office. There is plenty of parking, and the main shopping precinct is opposite the Heathmont railway station. The distant Mount Dandenong and Dandenong Ranges are visible from much of this shopping strip.

==Demographics==

As of the 2006 Census, the vast majority of residents (78.6%) were born in Australia, with slightly above-average proportions also born in England, Scotland, the Netherlands and Germany. The languages spoken by slightly above-average proportions of residents were English and German. There were above-average proportions of residents of no religion (23.9%) and Uniting Church (7.3%).
The average income of Heathmont residents was above the national average (with a median family income of $1,286 per week); the suburb tends to be better off than most of its nearest neighbours. The largest two occupational groupings were professionals (23.5%, above the national average) and clerical/administrative (17.3%, also above the national average). The unemployment rate of 3.2% was below the national average of 5.2%.

==Politics and representation==

Heathmont contained four voting booths at the 2010 federal election, all lying within the federal electorate of Deakin. Three of those booths saw the Liberal candidate win the most primary votes, yet only two saw the Liberals win a majority of two-party preferred votes after preferences. The combined booth results across the suburb saw the primary vote split 40.1% to Labor, 41.4% to the Liberals and 12.7% to the Greens. After preferences, the split was 52.5% to Labor and 47.5% to the Liberals. The suburb tends to be highly competitive electorally and is generally a reliable barometer for the overall voting population. Heathmont and surrounding areas were visited by federal politicians Joe Hockey, Kevin Rudd, Tony Abbott and Wayne Swan throughout 2010. In 2007, Heathmont was identified as one of the &#x27;wealthier pockets&#x27; of Deakin (along with Blackburn and Vermont) in an analysis of marginal &#x27;leafy&#x27; suburbs in Melbourne&#x27;s east, that were, by swinging to Labor, proving wrong the notion of a &#x27;rich Lib, poor Labor&#x27; myth.

==Schools==

<doc id="617178" wikidata="Q930104" url="?curid=617178" title="Marah (plant)">
<text>Marah (the manroots, wild cucumbers, or cucumber gourds) are flowering plants in the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), native to western North America. The genus (which Kellogg noted was characterized by extreme bitterness) was named for Marah in , which was said to be named for the bitter water there.

Except for the isolated range of &quot;Marah gilensis&quot; (Gila manroot) in west-central Arizona and island populations (&quot;M. macrocarpus&quot; var. &quot;major&quot;), all manroot species inhabit overlapping ranges distributed from Southern Canada to Northern Mexico. Although &quot;Marah oreganus&quot; (coastal manroot) extends inland into Idaho, all other manroot species except &quot;M. gilensis&quot; are confined to areas within 300 km of the Pacific Ocean coast.

==Description==
The manroots are perennial plants, growing from a large tuberous root. Most have stout, scabrous or hairy stems, with coiling tendrils that enable them to climb up other plants; they can also grow rapidly across level ground. Their leaves tend to have multiple lobes, up to 7 in some species. The fruits are striking and easily recognized. They are large, and spherical, oval or cylindrical. At a minimum they are in diameter, but can be up to long, and in many species they are covered in long spines. Both leaf and fruit shape vary widely between individual plants and leaves can be particularly variable even on the same vine.

The anthropomorphic common names &quot;manroot&quot; and &quot;old man in the ground&quot; derive from the swollen lobes and arm-like extensions of the unearthed tuber. On old plants, the tuber can be several meters long and weigh in excess of .

==Taxonomy and systematics==


&quot;Marah&quot; species hybridize freely where ranges overlap and this, in addition to intra-species leaf and fruit variability, makes definite identification of specimens a particular challenge.

A proper genetic analysis of &quot;Marah&quot; phylogeny has not yet been undertaken. The standard taxonomy has been based on morphological comparisons and geographic considerations.

Some authors include the manroots in genus &quot;Echinocystis&quot;. Considered as a separate genus, however, it includes six or seven species, some of them with well-defined varieties within them:

*&quot;Marah fabacea&quot; – California manroot
**&quot;Marah fabacea&quot; var. &quot;agrestis&quot;
**&quot;Marah fabacea&quot; var. &quot;fabacea&quot;
*&quot;Marah gilensis&quot; – Gila manroot
*&quot;Marah guadalupensis&quot; – often included in &quot;M. macrocarpus&quot; var. &quot;major&quot;
*&quot;Marah horridus&quot; – Sierra manroot
*&quot;Marah macrocarpa&quot; – Cucamonga manroot
**&quot;Marah macrocarpa&quot; var. &quot;macrocarpa&quot;
**&quot;Marah macrocarpa&quot; var. &quot;major&quot;
**&quot;Marah macrocarpa&quot; var. &quot;micrantha&quot;
*&quot;Marah oreganus&quot; – coastal manroot
*&quot;Marah watsonii&quot; – Taw manroot

==Use by humans==

&quot;Marah oreganus&quot; are used medicinally by Native Americans. The Chinook make a poultice from the gourd. The Squaxin mash the upper stalk in water to dip aching hands. The Chehalis burn the root and mixed the resulting powder with bear grease to apply to scrofula sores. The Coast Salish make a decoction to treat venereal disease, kidney trouble and scrofula sores.

The dried spiky fruit can be soaked in water so that the spikes can be easily removed. They are difficult to remove otherwise. The hard fruit becomes soft in water and once the spikes are gone, the fruit makes a very efficient loofa. The tubers of &quot;M. fabaceus&quot; and &quot;M. macrocarpus&quot; contain saponins which can act as a natural soap.

Tubers of &quot;M. fabaceus&quot; are crushed and thrown into bodies of water by the Kumeyaay to immobilize fish. The tubers contain megharrhin, a saponin-like glucoside. Saponins lower the surface tension of water allowing the formation of bubbles. It is likely that the substance enters the fish&#x27;s circulation through the gill arches where only a single-cell epithelium separates the water from the animal&#x27;s red blood cells. The affected fish float to the surface.

Like many medicinal plants, at least some &quot;Marah&quot; species are toxic if ingested and deaths have been reported from ingesting them.

Seeds of &quot;Marah fabaceus&quot; have been reported as being hallucinogenic.

<text>Ringwood is an eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Maroondah local government area. Ringwood recorded a population of 19,144 at the 2021 census.

Ringwood has many parks and reserves, most notably Ringwood Lake, an 8.5-hectare park is used for various recreational activities which includes a lake with bridge, sound shell, mining history display, playground, picnic shelters, barbecues and a bushland walking circuit.

==History==
Ringwood village emerged in the mid to late 19th century, following the 1850s land sales. Before this, Ringwood was used primarily for agriculture. The post office opened on 2 August 1875, in the then rural area.

In 1882, the construction of the Hawthorn to Lilydale railway through the suburb caused Ringwood to emerge as a more notable town.

1924 marked major growth for Ringwood. The railway was electrified and the township was further developed. This development boomed post war, causing the City of Ringwood to be declared in 1960.

The Ringwood clock tower was built in 1928 as a memorial to the war. After the successful post-depression subdivisions of land in the area, Ringwood was recognised to be a part of metropolitan Melbourne. Eastland Shopping Centre opened in Ringwood in 1967. It was redeveloped in the late 1990s and again in 2013. Its current state is 131,000 m2 (1,410,000 square feet) of retail and hospitality floor space, car parks and a Hoyts cinema complex. In 2009, the owners of Eastland, Queensland Investment Corporation, planned to commence another redevelopment of the Eastland site. The Arcade near Eastland and the Ringwood Library commenced re-location in 2012. Construction on the new centre began in 2013 and was completed in two stages. Stage one opened on 29 October 2015 and stage two on 5 May 2016.

Ringwood has been the site of a Cadbury chocolate factory since the company&#x27;s acquisition of MacRobertson Chocolates in 1967. The factory is the company&#x27;s second largest in Australia and produces chocolate bars, such as Cherry Ripe and Boost, and Easter eggs.

In 2009, the State Government controversially approved the building of a nine-storey housing development near Ringwood Lake, without Council or public consultation.
In 2007, Ringwood became the home of ConnectEast, owner and operator of Melbourne&#x27;s second toll road, EastLink.
In 2012, major retail chain store Costco announced plans to open in Ringwood. Construction is expected to finish mid-2013. It opened 20 November 2013 (Emma Hastings Maroondah Leader 20 November 2013 12:59PM)

Perhaps Ringwood&#x27;s most global notoriety is the development in 1958 of the &quot;Pride of Ringwood&quot; hop variety, which today flavours Foster&#x27;s Lager, Victoria Bitter and many other beers around the world. The hops were developed along the Mullum Mullum Creek, near the site of what later became Penguin Books, in 1963.

<text>Warranwood is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Maroondah local government area. Warranwood recorded a population of 4,820 at the .

==Etymology==

Warranwood is adjacent to Warrandyte South and Ringwood; its name is a conjunction of the two words. In 1946, the South Warrandyte Progress Association invited suggestions for a name, as at the time there was no definite name for the locality. At one time, it had been referred to as &quot;Croydon Heights&quot;. The choice of &quot;Warranwood&quot; from part-time resident Mrs. J. Harrison of Brysons Road was accepted by postal authorities and the Shire of Lillydale.

==Education==

Two schools are located in Warranwood; Melbourne Rudolf Steiner School, on Wonga Road and Warranwood Primary School, on Wellington Park Drive.

Warranwood Primary was formerly known as Warrandyte South Primary and relocated from Hall Rd. in Warrandyte South to its current location in Term 2, 1996.

<text>Chadstone is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Monash local government area. Chadstone recorded a population of 9,552 at the 2021 census.

Landmarks include the Waverley Basketball Centre, Jordanville Community Centre and the Matthew Flinders Hotel. Scotchmans Creek runs along Chadstone&#x27;s southern boundary, the Glen Waverley railway line along the northern boundary, Warrigal Road to the west and Huntingdale Road to the east. The Monash Freeway runs through the suburb.

==History==


Many of the houses in the Chadstone area were built in the postwar period using prefabricated concrete produced at the current site of Holmesglen Institute. The houses tend to be quite small, with two to three bedrooms and large blocks. It is relatively common for houses to be demolished and larger houses built to take advantage of the block size.

Chadstone Post Office opened on 8 April 1957 and Chadstone Centre Post Office opened on 3 October 1960. The Chadstone office closed in 1998.

Chadstone was home to Jordanville South Primary School on Baradine Street, which closed down at the end of the school year in 1993. It was also home to Chadstone High School (now closed), and Waverley High School (originally named Holmesglen High School, then renamed Jordanville High School and finally Waverley High School not to be confused with Mount Waverley High School located in Mount Waverley) which closed down in 1996. Chadstone&#x27;s &quot;Christ Campus&quot; of the Australian Catholic University closed down in the early 2000s, its land being bought by Chadstone Shopping Centre to expand.

==Today==

Chadstone is a small suburb, with parts previously known as Chadstone being rezoned to be incorporated into Malvern East. Several landmarks such as Chadstone Shopping Centre and the Chadstone campus of Holmesglen Institute of TAFE have retained their original names despite now being technically located in Malvern East. The current Chadstone locality incorporates an area formerly known as Jordanville (even though Jordanville Station is technically in Mount Waverley).

There are two schools in Chadstone, both of which are Roman Catholic Independent schools. They are Salesian College and St Mary Magdalen&#x27;s Primary School.

==Population==

In the 2016 Census, there were 8,641 people in Chadstone. 46.3% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were China 11.2%, India 4.5%, Sri Lanka 3.1%, Greece 2.8% and Malaysia 2.1%. 43.7% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 12.4%, Greek 7.2%, Cantonese 3.4%, Italian 2.8% and Sinhalese 2.4%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 32.7% and Catholic 20.0%.

==History==

The area was first occupied for farming in the 1850s and was originally named after a property, &quot;Clayton Vale&quot;, owned by lawyer John Hughes Clayton in the 1860s. A township was originally gazetted on Dandenong Road and in 1862 a primary school was opened at the corner of Dandenong Road and Clayton Road, to serve the whole of the Clayton district. This school changed its name to Clayton North Primary School in 1954.

The construction of the railway to Dandenong and Gippsland about 1 km south of Dandenong Road in 1878 prompted the start of a second township where the line crossed Clayton Road.

The Post Office opened on 18 November 1887 as Clayton&#x27;s Road Railway Station and was renamed Clayton in 1891.

Clayton&#x27;s rural lands and relative proximity to Melbourne attracted two institutions at the turn of the century: the Talbot Colony for Epileptics on land later occupied by Monash University, and a Women&#x27;s Convalescent Home. Apart from that, in 1900 the community consisted of farms, three hotels, two churches, a tennis court and a few shops. Market gardens, fruit growing and a municipal abattoir were the leading industries.

The 1960s saw the rapid disappearance of market gardens as urbanisation and industry advanced. At the western edge of Clayton the Oakleigh High School had been opened in 1955 and a second primary school was opened next year at Clayton South. Clayton East Post Office opened in 1958 (and closed 1979).

Melbourne&#x27;s second metropolitan university, Monash, was opened at Clayton in 1961. Monash is now Australia&#x27;s largest university. Primary schools at Westall and Clayton West opened in 1961 and 1962, and high schools at Westall and Monash (Clayton North) in 1963 and 1965. In the early sixties Clayton Technical School was opened (Mr Warby inaugural Principal) at the northern end of Browns Rd Clayton, and had pupils attend from wide and far. It had a Science wing and Woodwork and Metalwork workshops, as well as providing studies of the main matric curriculum, however, it was only up to 5th form (year 11). To complete Matric students mainly transferred to the Oakleigh High School for the last year of studies. At its peak attendance would have been over 1000 male pupils. It was closed sometime in the 1980s. The only piece of land left from where the school once stood, is now titled Fregon reserve. In 1971 the Catholic bishops of Victoria and Tasmania purchased land adjacent to Monash University to house their seminary, Corpus Christi College. The seminary was moved to Carlton in 1999, and the site now serves as a conference centre.

Numerous factories, including Volkswagen (later became the Datsun/Nissan plant), Wilke Printing, Robert Bosch GmbH and Repco were opened after the Second World War. Clayton South and Westall are closer to the sandbelt areas, with the Spring Valley Golf Club, The Grange Reserve and Heatherton Park. Sanitary landfill sites occupy former sand quarries.

While the local community was formerly a part of the now defunct City of Oakleigh local council, in 1995 the municipality became the south-western corner for the City of Monash.

==Public Library and Clayton Community Centre==

A large new building at the corner of Cooke Street and Centre Road was opened in April 2008. It houses the Clayton branch of the Monash Public Library Service, a swimming pool, gym, counselling services, health and child care services, theatre and meeting rooms.

<doc id="617189" wikidata="Q3108712" url="?curid=617189" title="Glen Waverley, Victoria">
<text>Glen Waverley is an eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, located southeast of the Melbourne central business district. It is the council seat of the City of Monash local government area and a prominent suburban commercial district, as well as a local transport hub as the interchange between the Glen Waverley line terminus and the upcoming SRL East ring line. Glen Waverley recorded a population of 42,642 at the 2021 census.

==History==
The area was first settled in the mid nineteenth century and later developed as orchards and farming lands. The Post Office opened on 1 July 1885 as Black Flat in the area to the south of the railway line, was renamed &#x27;Glen Waverley&#x27; in 1921, and Glen Waverley South in 1963 on the same day Glen Waverley North office (open since 1954) was renamed Glen Waverley (from 1994 The Glen). The name &quot;Waverley&quot; comes from a novel by Sir Walter Scott.

Major development occurred in the 1950s to 1970s with rapid infilling of housing built to a generally high standard on large (typically 800m2) blocks. In particular Legend Park Estate was opened by Hooker Rex in 1971. Much of that housing stock is now ageing and renewal is occurring, frequently involving subdivision of the larger blocks into townhouse development. The suburb was also the site of Victoria&#x27;s first McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, which opened on 12 September 1973, at the corner of High Street and Springvale Road. It was opened shortly after the original in Sydney. Following the Sydney McDonald&#x27;s closure, it became Australia&#x27;s longest surviving McDonald&#x27;s until it was demolished in 2016, and subsequently replaced with a modernised version.

==Geography==

One of the largest suburbs in Melbourne by land area, Glen Waverley is bounded by the Dandenong Creek and Jells Park to the east, Waverley Road and View Mount Road to the southeast, Ferntree Gully Road to the south, Blackburn Road to the west and Highbury Road to the north. Springvale Road, a major north–south arterial, divides the suburb into two asymmetrical halves. The geography varies from river flats adjacent to the Dandenong Creek in the east to the hilly region between the Dandenong Creek and the Scotchmans Creek (a small first-order tributary of the Yarra River) catchments.

==Economy==
Glen Waverley is home to the only commercial district within its local government area that is north of the Monash Freeway, a suburban region which accounts for more than half of the City of Monash&#x27;s administrative area. Most of its shopping centres are streetside retail stores and restaurants along and around Kingsway and the Glen Waverley railway station. The Glen Shopping Centre, located at southwestern corner of the junction between Springvale Road and High Street Road, is the eleventh-largest shopping mall in Victoria.

Glen Waverley has also developed to become somewhat of a business hub in metropolitan Melbourne, with many international companies including Toshiba, Ansell, and NEC all having their Australian headquarters in the suburb.

==Facilities==

The main street of Glen Waverley is Kingsway. In recent years, Kingsway has developed into a vibrant dining and entertainment area, with strong Asian influences. Also on Kingsway is Century City Walk, a multiplex mall that houses a Village Cinemas multiplex (equipped with 4DX, VMax and Gold Class facilities), a Strike Bowling Bar and various eateries, as well as many hotels such as Novotel Glen Waverley, Hotel Ibis, Waverley International Hotel, Apartments of Waverley and the Quest Hotel. There is also a large branch of the Monash Public Library Service.

High-rise apartment blocks began featuring with the construction of IBIS Hotel, constructed at the southern end of Kingsway and bordering Springvale Rd. In 2011, IKON Glen Waverley was constructed as a 10-storey apartment, office, retail and car parking complex between the railway station and Kingsway. In 2016, the next multi-storey residence apartment block was announced for 52–54 O&#x27;Sullivan Rd, to replace the former The Walk Arcade complex. This project was finally completed in September 2019. The period 2015–2019 also saw major reconstruction work of The Glen which incorporates the Sky Garden apartment complex. Sky Garden was completed in 2019 with residents moving in just prior to COVID in early 2020.

The suburb also has numerous churches, and is home to the Victoria Police Academy, which occupies a former Roman Catholic seminary. Located on and adjacent to Kingsway is also the Monash Council Building and Glen Waverley Library.

The Glen (formerly known as &quot;Centro The Glen&quot;) is a local regional shopping centre owned, (formerly managed and developed by Vicinity Centres). Although smaller than nearby shopping centres such as Westfield Knox or Chadstone, The Glen has continually grown and evolved. In 2015, plans were announced for a $500M redevelopment which was completed 2019 just prior to COVID and the prolonged shutdown periods that Melbourne endured. Major retail tenants of the current shopping centre include David Jones, Target, ALDI, Coles, Woolworths, UNIQLO, H&amp;M, JB Hi-Fi, Chemist Warehouse and Spotlight. A major feature of the redevelopment, besides the 3 Sky Garden apartment towers, is the fine dining/restaurant precinct. Today Vicinity The Glen has a reputation of being a fine dining and up-market retail experience. The relocation of the food court to the north-east corner has enabled diners to enjoy views looking out to Mt Dandenong.

<text>Franz von Bayros (28 May 1866 – 3 April 1924) was an Austrian commercial artist, illustrator, and painter, best known for his controversial &quot;Tales at the Dressing Table&quot; portfolio. He belonged to the Decadent movement in art, often utilizing erotic themes and phantasmagoric imagery.

== Early years ==
Bayros was born in Zagreb, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is, today, Croatia. At the age of seventeen, he passed the entrance examination for the Vienna Academy with Eduard von Engerth. Bayros mixed in high society and was part of the circle of friends of Johann Strauss II, whose stepdaughter Alice he married in 1896. The next year, Bayros moved to Munich.
== Career and death ==

In 1904, he gave his first exhibition in Munich, which was well received. From 1904 until 1908, he traveled to Paris and Italy to further his studies. In 1911, he created his most famous and controversial work, &quot;Tales from the Dressing Table&quot; for which he was later arrested and exiled from Germany. Returning to Vienna, he felt like an outsider and the outbreak of the First World War increased his sense of alienation. His work can be found at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He drew over 2000 illustrations in total.

The artist died in Vienna in 1924, from a cerebral hemorrhage.

<doc id="617191" wikidata="Q3051459" url="?curid=617191" title="Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine">
<text>Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine is a bi-monthly American digest size fiction magazine specializing in crime fiction, particularly detective fiction, and mystery fiction. Launched in fall 1941 by Mercury Press, EQMM is named after the fictitious author Ellery Queen, who wrote novels and short stories about a fictional detective named Ellery Queen. From 1993, EQMM changed its cover title to be &quot;Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine&quot; (without the &quot;&#x27;s&quot;), but the table of contents still retains the full name.

== Background ==
Ellery Queen was the pseudonym of the team of Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee, who had been writing under the name since 1929. &quot;EQMM&quot; was created to provide a market for mystery fiction above the common run of pulp crime magazines of the day. Dannay served as the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief (although still under the name Ellery Queen) from its creation until his death in 1982, when managing editor Eleanor Sullivan succeeded to the post. Following her death in 1991, Janet Hutchings became editor of &quot;EQMM&quot;.

In &quot;Bloody Murder&quot;, Julian Symons offered this description of the publication:
== History ==

=== Mystery League and pre-EQMM era (1933–1934) ===
Around four years after Ellery Queen&#x27;s successful debut, &quot;The Roman Hat Mystery&quot;, Dannay and Lee decided to produce a magazine that would publish only quality mystery fiction. Their first attempt, &quot;Mystery League&quot;, a monthly magazine for mystery fiction, debuted in October 1933, with Dannay and Lee as its only employees. In a time when most of the mystery magazines at the time were digests that would cut long novels into pieces before publishing them, &quot;Mystery League&quot; published only complete short novels, which helped to maintain the quality of the stories it published while leading to a higher selling price of 25¢. When America was still recovering from the Great Depression, this was too high a price for most people to purchase a magazine. The magazine ceased publication after only four issues, but &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; took over the basic principle of publishing complete short mystery novels of high quality.

=== Creation (1941) ===
In the fall of 1941, the first issue of &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, under the ownership of Lawrence E. Spivak of The Mercury Press, went to press. Dannay assumed primary editorial responsibility for the magazine. The magazine debuted as quarterly, and thanks to its popularity, it went bimonthly in the following year and then monthly in 1946.

Just like &quot;Mystery League&quot;, the first issue of &quot;EQMM&quot; contained seven complete mystery stories from Dashiell Hammett, Margery Allingham, T.S. Stribling, Anthony Abbot, Cornell Woolrich, Fredrick Hazlitt Brennan, and Ellery Queen himself. Dannay admitted in his message to readers that &quot;This first issue is frankly experimental.&quot; In sharp contrast to &quot;Mystery League&quot;″s failure, the first issue of &quot;EQMM&quot; sold more than 90,000 copies, far beyond anyone&#x27;s expectations. &quot;EQMM&quot; has become the leading American magazine of the genre and is credited with setting the standard for modern crime and mystery short stories and keeping short stories of the genre alive and flourishing.

=== Frederic Dannay&#x27;s editorship (1941–1982) ===
Frederic Dannay served as editor-in-chief for EQMM for more than 40 years. As an editor, he aimed to establish a more respectful reputation for mysteries and keep the genre strong. Dannay explained his manifesto for &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; as being to &quot;raise the sights of mystery writers generally to a genuine literary form,&quot; to &quot;encourage good writing among our colleagues by offering a practical market not otherwise available,&quot; and to &quot;develop new writers seeking expression in the genre.&quot;

To achieve his goal, Dannay worked hard to explore and represent every aspect of mysteries, expanding the variety of materials of &quot;EQMM&quot; to a great extent, while he believed his efforts also served to cater to the widest possible range of tastes and attract a larger audience. One of his major efforts was to find and publish stories written by big names with elements of crime or mystery, and as a result, more than forty Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners, including William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, had works published in &quot;EQMM&quot;. Dannay also set a global orientation for &quot;EQMM&quot;, publishing works from writers all over the world, from works by English writers like Agatha Christie to the first English translation of the work of Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. Dannay published the first black detective story (&quot;Corollary&quot; by Hughes Allison) in &quot;EQMM&quot; in 1948.

The first &quot;EQMM&quot; short story contest was held in 1946. William Faulkner, the future Nobel Prize winner, wrote a new story for the contest and won second prize, while the first prize went to Manly Wade Wellman. Faulkner was furious about his loss, and in a letter to his agent, he described the contest as &quot;a manufactured mystery story contest.&quot; Some contend that the story Faulkner submitted, &quot;An Error in Chemistry,&quot; is not among his best. Dannay continued to publish works from Faulkner in &quot;EQMM&quot;, increasing Faulkner&#x27;s popularity among the general public.

After the first few years of Dannay reprinted stories he had gathered for his own personal collection of mysteries while slowly adding previously unpublished stories by both famous and unknown authors. &quot;EQMM&quot; began accepting novels from the general public in 1948. As another effort to expand the variety of materials of the magazines, during Dannay&#x27;s editorship, the Department of First Stories was established in 1949, which aimed to publish works from new writers and fostering new talent. Dannay himself published more than 500 first stories by first-time writers, and many of them, including Stanley Ellin and David Morrell, grew to become famous writers. In 1953, &quot;EQMM&quot; bought &quot;Black Mask Magazine&quot;, and turned it into a special department which &quot;features harder-edged works of crime, noir, and private-eye writers.&quot; &quot;Black Mask&quot; ceased to exist in &quot;EQMM&quot; in the 1970s, but was reinstated in 2008 and continues to run today. 

Crime novelist and stage magician Clayton Rawson was the magazine&#x27;s managing editor between 1963 and his death in 1971.

Several spin-offs of the magazine came into being and died during this period. Overseas editions for US troops appeared in May 1945 and ceased publication in June 1946 after the end of World War II and the return of US troops. They were almost identical to the normal US edition of &quot;EQMM&quot;, with the only difference of the title &quot;Special Edition for the Armed Forces Overseas&quot; or &quot;Overseas Edition for the Armed Services&quot; printed on the cover. Since advertisements were not allowed in this kind of publication for the US Army, the opening three pages of this edition, where the ads would typically be, were replaced with an additional story. Otherwise, an additional puzzle would be added at the end as a make-up. An Australian reprint edition started from July 1947 and ceased publication in November 1964, and a UK reprint edition was available between February 1953 and September 1964. Spin-offs that translated the magazine into other languages like Japanese, French, Italian, German were all once available, but all ceased publication eventually.

=== Eleanor Sullivan&#x27;s editorship (1982–1991) ===
After Frederic Dannay died in 1982, Eleanor Sullivan took his place as editor of &quot;EQMM&quot;. She was the managing editor from 1970 to 1982, hand-picked by Dannay after an interview. She had written many articles under a pen name for newspapers, magazines and books.

During Sullivan&#x27;s editorship, in 1985, the EQMM Readers Award began. This is an annual award for the favorite stories of the magazine&#x27;s readers. It has since become one of the most important awards of its genre. The first EQMM Readers Award went to Clark Howard.

Sullivan also served as editor-in-chief of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; from 1975 to 1981, which helped to establish a closer relationship between the two magazines. After Sullivan became editor of &quot;EQMM&quot; and Cathleen Jordan became the editor of &quot;AHMM&quot; in 1982, they worked together to keep both magazines prosperous, and often passed stories to each other to find a more suitable place for them.

=== Janet Hutchings&#x27; editorship (1991–2025) ===
Janet Hutchings began her career as editor and publisher at the Doubleday Book Clubs, where she was given opportunities to read for the Mystery Guild, to which almost every mystery or crime novel waiting to be published in America would be submitted for possible inclusion. This experience greatly enhanced her passion for mysteries, and later she became Mystery Editor for Walker &amp; Company and published a series of anthologies of stories from &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. The connection allowed her to meet Sullivan at the &quot;EQMM&quot; 50th anniversary party in 1991, and she was later interviewed as a possible successor to the magazine&#x27;s editor. After Sullivan died in 1991, Hutchings succeeded as editor of &quot;EQMM&quot; and has held the position since then.

Hutchings inherited Dannay&#x27;s principle of the magazines, making quality the only standard while trying to maintain a great variety of the genre mysteries and a global focus. She said in an interview that her aim had always been to try to &quot;make EQMM&#x27;s umbrella as wide as that of the genre&quot;, and to publish stories from the broadest possible range of mysteries. In 2003, Hutchings established the Passport to Crime department, which would translate works from other languages on a regular basis. She explained this as the magazine scouting more actively for stories in other languages instead of just waiting for submissions from foreign writers.

During Hutchings&#x27; editorship, &quot;EQMM&quot; embraced the trend of digitalization. In the early 1990s, it converted to desktop publishing, and in 2011 Hutchings admitted that she now read submissions entirely on a Kindle. In 2009, &quot;EQMM&quot;″s podcast series began, which offered audiences audio renditions of stories from the magazine&#x27;s archives. In the same year, &quot;EQMM&quot;″s first major digital editions became available in addition to the traditional print format. Something Is Going to Happen, the &quot;EQMM&quot; editor&#x27;s blog, was launched in 2012, which formed a community where readers can discuss mystery and crime fiction, and where &quot;EQMM&quot; editors, writers and readers can communicate more directly. The official website of &quot;EQMM&quot; offered information about the magazines to both subscribers and writers. In January 2018, &quot;EQMM&quot; launched its first web-only column, &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, on its official website. Written by Dean Jobb and scheduled to be updated monthly for free, the new column studies and presents true crime cases, a topic that &quot;EQMM&quot; used to lack.

Janet Hutchings&#x27; retired as editor of &quot;EQMM&quot; with the publication of the January/February 2025 issue, which was the 1000th issue of the publication.

== Characteristics ==

&quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; has several distinguishing hallmarks, most of which were established during the days of Frederic Dannay&#x27;s editorship and have been maintained and strengthened since then. It is believed that these characteristics have helped &quot;EQMM&quot; to survive and flourish for more than 80 years while retaining its reputation as the leading periodical in the genre.

=== Quality ===
From the creation of &quot;EQMM&quot;, Dannay was determined to make the magazine &quot;a quality publication devoted exclusively to the printing of the best detective-crime short-story literature,&quot; making quality the sole criterion for inclusion in the magazine, and this principle was inherited by succeeded editors. The quality of the magazine has been proved by numerous awards won by stories first published on &quot;EQMM&quot;, and won by the magazine itself. &quot;EQMM&quot; has been nominated more than 370 times and has won over 110 awards, including awards from those most eminent mystery organisations in the world, including Agatha Awards, Anthony Awards, Arthur Ellis Awards, Barry Awards, Derringer Awards, Edgar Awards, International Thriller Awards, Macavity Awards, Robert L. Fish Awards, Shamus Awards, Spur Awards, and the Ellery Queen Award.

=== Variety ===
&quot;EQMM&quot; has always striven to explore the broadest possible range of mystery, trying to present every aspect of the genre, which results in a great variety of stories, including hard-boiled stories, classic English mysteries, noirs, suspense, cozy mysteries and the work of literary writers. With publishing the best as its principle, &quot;EQMM&quot; has also helped to break down the barrier between supposedly &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; literary forms while blurring the boundaries of genres.

The variety of the magazine is also reflected in its variety of contributing writers. As Dannay explained, the magazine proposed &quot;to give stories by big-name writers, by lesser-known writers, and by unknown writers. But no matter what their source, they will be superior stories.&quot; While the magazine published works by great literary figures, it also started the Department of First Stories in 1949. The magazine has long enjoyed contributions from international writers.

=== Longevity ===
&quot;EQMM&quot; was one of a relative handful of fiction magazines to survive the decline in American short-fiction publications from the 1950s to the 1970s. It is now the longest-running mystery fiction magazine in existence. Throughout its history it has actively encouraged new writers, and today, when most major publications only accept submissions through literary agents, &quot;EQMM&quot; still accepts unsolicited submissions through the mail. Writers may also use the online submission manager. The magazine&#x27;s Department of First Stories has introduced hundreds of new writers, many of whom have become regular contributors.

=== Global orientation ===
&quot;EQMM&quot; had a global orientation from the beginning. Dannay introduced many international writers, including the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges, to the English literary community. Dannay also ran a number of Worldwide Short Story Contests in the early decades of the magazine, bringing in submissions from all around the world. He published an &quot;All Nations&quot; special issue of &quot;EQMM&quot; in August 1948, which included stories from every continent but Antarctica. In 2003, current editor Janet Hutchings launched the Passport to Crime department for translations from foreign authors.

== Contents ==
=== Authors ===
&quot;EQMM&quot; regularly publishes short fiction from established mystery novelists such as Edward D. Hoch, Jeffery Deaver, Michael Gilbert, Peter Lovesey, John Lutz, Ruth Rendell, and Janwillem van de Wetering. It has also published authors not generally considered mystery writers, including A. A. Milne, Stephen King, W. Somerset Maugham, P. G. Wodehouse, Joyce Carol Oates, Theodore Sturgeon, and Phyllis Diller.

=== Sections ===
&quot;EQMM&quot; regularly publishes two nonfiction sections: &quot;The Jury Box&quot; contains book reviews by Steve Steinbock and &quot;Blog Bytes&quot; contains reviews and updates of crime and mystery short fiction blogs by Bill Crider. Twice a year, former &quot;Jury Box&quot; columnist Jon Breen contributes a guest column.

=== Artists ===
Cover artists have included George Salter, Nicholas Solovioff and Norman Saunders. In 2007–2008, &quot;EQMM&quot; republished covers from the golden age of mystery fiction, circa 1940s.

=== Awards ===
&quot;EQMM&quot; sponsors the annual Readers Choice Award, voted upon by readers.

=== Series ===
&quot;EQMM&quot; has always depended heavily on series characters and stories, such as the &quot;Black Widowers&quot; tales of Isaac Asimov, the &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; stories of John Mortimer, and the &quot;Ganelon&quot; stories of James Powell. Foremost among series authors was the late Edward D. Hoch, who created at least a dozen independent series for &quot;EQMM&quot; since his first story appeared in 1962. From May 1973 to May 2007, he had at least one original story in every issue of &quot;EQMM&quot;, a string that reached an unparalleled 34 years; in that same period he published about fifty stories in &quot;EQMM&quot;″s sister publication, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;.

<text>Mount Waverley is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Monash local government area. Mount Waverley recorded a population of 35,340 at the 2021 census.

It is 16 km from Melbourne at its closest point. Mount Waverley railway station, located in the main shopping precinct, is located 17.8 km from Flinders Street railway station.

==Geography==

Mount Waverley is a large suburb, rectangular in shape, bounded by Highbury Road in the north, Ferntree Gully Road in the south, Huntingdale Road in the west, and Blackburn Road in the east. At the centre of the suburb is Mount Waverley Village Shopping Centre, and in the south-east is Pinewood Shopping Centre.

==History==

The Mount Waverley area, then part of the Parish of Mulgrave, was divided by straight roads running north–south and east–west, each exactly one mile apart, by Assistant Surveyor Eugene Bellairs, in 1853. Mount Waverley Post Office opened on 9 October 1905.

Mount Waverley is famous for its heritage streets which date from the 1930s. Due to the onset of the Great Depression, the building of houses on the suburb&#x27;s earliest estates did not commence in earnest until the early 1950s. According to Lachlan Bath, president of the Ashburton Historical Society, the suburb&#x27;s streets had been laid down, but no houses were built; merely a row of &quot;cardboard boxes&quot; housed the first few residents who had migrated east from the &quot;slums of Ashburton to enjoy a better standard of living&quot;, only to be bitterly disappointed with the estate agents who promised milk and honey but instead delivered a mosquito infested swamp. However, the Ashburton immigrants, while disappointed, all agreed that the &quot;swamp&quot; was a major step up from their former homes. Post Offices at Mount Waverley North (opened 1959 closed 1983), Mount Waverley South (opened 1968 closed 1973), and Mount Waverley West (opened 1964 closed 1977) chart the wider residential development of the suburb.

===Glen Alvie Estate===
Close to Mount Waverley Village are the suburb&#x27;s first streets, once designed to become the very epitome of prestigious country estate living and an extravagant idea decades ahead of its time. Sherwood Park was part of the prestigious Glen Alvie estate that sought to form country club type living to Waverley. Top quality land was acquired – 25 acres were bought from Mr Jack Lechte in 1928, and some from Mr Cornell, as well as a large parcel of land from Mr F. Closter – in all about 50 acres. This fertile land had been dairy farm – Ayrshire-Jersey cross cows, with some pigs, a plum and apple orchard, and stock feed crops – canola, maize and lucerne (alfalfa). &quot;Glen Alvie Estates Limited&quot; allocated five of the fifty acres for recreation facilities. There was to be a club house, six tennis courts, a bowling green, a croquet lawn, a mashee lawn, and a large swimming pool. These were to be laid out adjacent to Sherwood Park, a huge central area, lined with date palms that are still seen today. Large houses around the periphery were to be built, and one-way roads would be constructed to prevent traffic problems; and also elsewhere in the estate – tucked between the large unfenced building sites and gardens to give a sense of living on a country estate. A golf course had been established nearby by 1930; St John&#x27;s Wood Golf Links, (now Riversdale Golf Club), the gardens of which were designed by Edna Walling, and a school was also nearby; Mount Waverley Primary School. This was to be garden suburb living.

The suburb&#x27;s original streets, including Park Lane, Virginia Street and Sherwood Road, were built of concrete, not the less expensive asphalt. Council intended to charge an extra rate to residents of the estate to cover the huge loan of building these concrete streets. The surface is still the same as it was in the 1930s, with only minor maintenance over the decades. Residential development did not resurge until the 1950s. In early 2008, a new smoother asphalt surface was finally laid along the strip of Stephensons Road between Waverley Road and Mount Waverley Village shopping centre. 

Stephensons Road (which is the sixth name change of a long continuous road beginning at the intersection of Palm Beach Drive &amp; Old Wells Road, Patterson Lakes and beginning as state route 23 in Chelsea Heights) is the main road of Mount Waverley that runs straight through the middle of the suburb. The name Stephensons Road is solely in the suburb of Mount Waverley, which is between its southern boundary Ferntree Gully Road (continuing as Clayton Road) to its northern boundary Highbury Road (continuing as Middleborough Road).

==Today==

One of the highest points in Mount Waverley is the reservoir on High Street Road. The natural land surrounding this landmark is over 138–150 metres above sea level. Construction of the reservoir began in 1927.

The waterways in the suburb are Damper Creek in the north, and Scotchmans Creek, in the south. Significant parks within Mount Waverley include Valley Reserve, Damper Creek Reserve, and Federal Reserve. All reserves contain significant areas of remnant native bushland. Significant wetland areas in Mount Waverley are found within Valley Reserve and in the Scotchmans Creek valley.

The popular Melbourne Street Directory Melway was first produced in a garage in Mount Waverley in 1966. It is now published from premises in Ricketts Road in Mount Waverley. 

Over many years, Mount Waverley has held an annual Christmas Carols event, which has featured many local performers. The large trader-supported event ceased to run from 2010, with the City of Monash preferring to put its main support behind the annual Carols by Candlelight in Jells Park.

Since 2012 a smaller-scale event called &quot;Carols in the Village&quot; has been organised by the Mount Waverley Council of Churches, with mostly local performers.

Mount Waverley is the home to numerous electronics and IT companies and the area is a hub of these industries in Melbourne. 

The Mount Waverley branch of Monash Public Library Service is located on the north side of Mount Waverley station in Miller Crescent. Waverley Private Hospital is located on Blackburn Road and has served the community since 1972.

<text>God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian, by Kurt Vonnegut, is a collection of short fictional interviews written by Vonnegut and first broadcast on WNYC. The title parodies that of Vonnegut&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;. It was published in book form in 1999.

== Synopsis ==
The premise of the collection is that Vonnegut employs Dr. Jack Kevorkian to give him near-death experiences, allowing Vonnegut access to heaven and those in it for a limited time. While in the afterlife Vonnegut interviews a range of people including Adolf Hitler, William Shakespeare, Eugene V. Debs, Isaac Asimov, Isaac Newton and the ever-present Kilgore Trout (a fictional character created by Vonnegut in his earlier works).

<text>Mulgrave is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 21 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Monash local government area. Mulgrave recorded a population of 19,889 at the 2021 census.

The suburb takes its name from Mulgrave Castle in the English County of North Yorkshire. Sir George Phipps, the Earl of Mulgrave in the Peerage of Great Britain, served as the Governor of Victoria from 1879 to 1884.

The suburb in turn gave its name to the Mulgrave Freeway, which was later renamed to the Monash Freeway.

==History==

The first settler in Mulgrave parish (a division of the County of Bourke, which covers the Melbourne urban area) was Thomas Napier, in 1839. He was a Scottish builder who first reached the Colony of Victoria in the mid-1830s. Napier settled on the banks of Dandenong Creek and built his homestead in the Bushy Park Wetlands, in what is now Jells Park. None of the original homesteads remain, though some were demolished as late as the latter part of the 20th century. Remains of some homesteads were uncovered during the construction of the EastLink Tollway, temporarily halting work while they were archaeologically examined.

The first Mulgrave Post Office opened on 1 January 1869 but was renamed Wheelers Hill in 1888. In 1904, a second Mulgrave Post Office opened but closed again in 1956. The third Mulgrave Post Office opened in 1967 and closed in 1978. Meanwhile, a Mulgrave North (later Brandon Park) office opened in 1971, and a Mulgrave East (later Waverley Gardens) office opened in 1978.

===From Parish to shire===
On 19 January 1857, the Oakleigh &amp; Mulgrave Road District (an early form of local government in Victoria) was proclaimed, covering the same area as that covered by the parishes of Oakleigh and Mulgrave. On 1 December 1871, the road district was redesignated as a shire and renamed Shire of Oakleigh. On 13 March 1891, the Borough of Oakleigh was created by excising part of Oakleigh Shire, and, in 1897, Oakleigh Shire was renamed as Mulgrave Shire.

===Reduction of size===
Throughout its history, Mulgrave has been plagued by the shifting of its borders and the reduction of its total size. Its borders remained relatively unchanged until 1949 when land was transferred from Mulgrave Shire to Oakleigh City. This occurred again a decade later with the Shire of Mulgrave reduced to . As a part of the changes, offices for the Shire were opened in present-day Notting Hill.

The end of Mulgrave Shire as a name occurred in April 1961, when it was proclaimed a city but renamed as Waverley. The name nonetheless continues in use as the name of the suburb and of the parish.

==Present day==

Mulgrave is one of the few Melbourne suburbs split into two distinct areas, with each sharing the common name but not prefixing it with &#x27;East&#x27; or &#x27;West&#x27;. This came about as a result of the renaming of parts of Mulgrave to Wheelers Hill, Victoria in the late 1990s. So separated by distance are the two parts that a group local residents from the South Eastern area campaigned, albeit unsuccessfully, in 2004 to have the area renamed to Waverley Park, Victoria.

Mulgrave is now best known for Jacksons Road, which runs through the eastern part of the suburb. Jacksons Road is familiar to many Melburnians due to the Jacksons Road Interchange with the Monash Freeway. The Jacksons Road Interchange is a VicRoads timing point for traffic travelling to/from the city. 

Jacksons Road is a common point of reference for radio news traffic reports when broadcasting travel times into/from the city travelling on the Monash Freeway. Other major points of interest in Mulgrave are the Waverley Gardens Shopping Centre, the Village Green Hotel on the south-west corner of Springvale and Ferntree Gully Roads, the Sunday Mulgrave Farmers&#x27; Market on the corner of Jacksons and Wellington Roads, and the former Waverley Park AFL/VFL football ground, now a redeveloped housing estate.

==Transport==
Metropolitan buses run through this area as well as two popular SmartBus routes and the original hourly services. Most of these bus routes are run by Ventura Bus Lines.

==Sport==

The suburb has multiple Australian Rules football teams, The Mulgrave Lions, competing in the local Eastern Football League and the Mazenod Old Collegians FC competing in the Victorian Amateur Football Association.

There is also a Mulgrave Cricket Club and a Mulgrave Junior Cricket Club as well as the Mazenod Cricket Club which both compete in the Eastern Cricket Association. Mulgrave Cricket Club also competes in the southern churches and district association.

The Mulgrave Lions and the Mulgrave Cricket Club share Mulgrave Reserve, off Garnett Road, as their home ground. There is also the St Pauls Cricket Club and the Wellington Tennis Club at Southern Reserve on Police Road, as well as the Mulgrave Country Club Cricket club located at Wellington Reserve.

Mazenod College is located in Mulgrave, and offers a number of sporting clubs through its Old Collegians&#x27; Association, which is open to members of the community as well as current and former students.

<text>The plain-backed pipit or plain pipit (Anthus leucophrys) is a medium-sized passerine bird which is a resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara Desert.

It is found in open habitats, especially short grassland and cultivation. It builds its cup-shaped nest on the ground and usually lays three eggs. Like other pipits, this species is insectivorous.
The plain-backed pipit is a large pipit at 17 cm, but is otherwise an undistinguished looking species, faintly streaked grey-brown above and pale below with light breast streaking. It has a strong white supercilium, and dark moustachial stripes. It has long legs and tail, and a long dark bill. Sexes are similar, but juveniles have warmer brown upperparts.

Some care must be taken to distinguish this species from wintering tawny pipits, &quot;Anthus campestris&quot;. The plain-backed pipit is sturdier and darker than the Tawny, and stands more upright. Perhaps the best distinction is the characteristic &quot;ssissik&quot; call, quite different from the tawny pipit&#x27;s &quot;tchilip&quot;.

<text>Notting Hill is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 19 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Monash local government area. Notting Hill recorded a population of 2,895 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Since ancient times, the Woi Wurrung occupied an area which extended from the Werribee River in the south west, Mount Macedon in the north west, Mount William in the Great Dividing Range to the north and across to Mount Baw Baw in the east. The Wurundjeri and the Boonwurrung are acknowledged as the traditional owners and custodians of the land.

The centre of the original township of Notting Hill is on Ferntree Gully Road. The area is more a plateau than a hill, and is the site of two local water storages. A European settler, Thomas Wilkinson, is generally accepted as giving the area its name because of his association with Notting Hill in London. He was a carrier between Oakleigh and Ferntree Gully and in the late 1870s opened a refreshment stop at Notting Hill, 4 km. from Oakleigh.

Notting Hill Post Office opened on 4 April 1887 and closed in 1975.

Ferntree Gully Road was the main thoroughfare between Mulgrave Shire and Oakleigh, and at the beginning of the 20th century there were a large number of farms at Notting Hill. In 1920 there were dairy and poultry farms and market gardens, and the families agitated for a school which was finally opened in 1927. The school had an active Young Farmers&#x27; Club with livestock kept in the school grounds, and in 1937 was judged Victoria&#x27;s best Young Farmers&#x27; Club. Notting Hill Primary School was closed in the mid 1970s with Students transferred to the newly built Monash Primary School. The shire transferred its offices from Oakleigh to Notting Hill in 1920, where they remained until 1955 when the growing area of Glen Waverley was the site chosen for larger offices.

The residential area of Notting Hill (formerly Clayton North, Postcode 3168) consists of some 700 houses, bordered to the north and west by Ferntree Gully and Blackburn Roads, and to the south and east by factories. The development, Westerfield Estate, was built by A.V. Jennings as their first &#x27;planned suburb&#x27;, with no through roads, and easy pedestrian access to shops and schools. The first houses went up in the late 1950s. The small shopping strip on Westerfield Drive originally consisted of a Milk Bar, Butcher, small Supermarket, Green Grocer, Doctor, Hairdresser and Chemist. As of 2012 only the Milk Bar remains, the remaining shopfronts are now small business offices.

Monash High School (later Secondary College) was originally opened in 1965 on the grounds of Notting Hill Primary School, moving to a permanent location at the corner of Duerdin and Nantilla Road. The Community funded Westerfield Kindergarten was built from a plan created by Bob Fuller, an architect who lived in Risdon Drive with his family. It opened in the late 1960s. Monash Primary School was constructed in mid 1970s to replace the largely portable classroom Notting Hill Primary School. 1960 saw building commence at Monash University (est. 1958) which is situated at the southern boundary of Notting Hill. In the 1970s, the Rusden Teachers College (later a Campus of Deakin University) was built on the eastern boundary of Notting Hill.

==Present==

The Notting Hill Hotel remains a prominent landmark, being established in 1891; it is frequented by nearby university students and locals of Notting Hill. The owner, Kath Byer, ran the establishment until her death on 15 November 2010 and did so since 1936 when she bought the business with her husband Sidney (Lofty) Byer. Much of Notting Hill is occupied by industrial premises, a large drive-in hardware superstore and the Monash Business Park.

Today Notting Hill is a busy suburb located between Clayton and Mount Waverley. The heart of the suburb is the residential estate. The community here has been renewed in recent years by the arrival of many young families and students. A comparison of the 2001 and 2006 Census returns for Notting Hill shows a rapid increase in the young adult population, and an increasingly diverse population in ethnic terms. Residents have been brought together as a community by their collective opposition to the closure of all of the educational facilities in and around the estate: the Rusden campus in 2002, followed by the kindergarten in 2004, and then both state schools in 2005 and 2006. Residents formed the Notting Hill Community Association to fight the closures of these institutions and the ugly developments proposed to replace them. They have won several battles, but the struggle continues. Monash City Council has responded to the Association&#x27;s concerns for loss of local facilities by refurbishing the kindergarten site for use by the community. The Notting Hill Neighbourhood House was opened by the Governor of Victoria, Professor David de Kretser, on Saturday 28 July 2007.

<text>Oakleigh is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia 14 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Monash local government area. Oakleigh recorded a population of 8,442 at the 2021 census.

Once a large independent city, Oakleigh was absorbed into Melbourne as part of the eastward expansion of the metropolis in the 1950s. As a result, it once had its own large historic Central Business District, its municipality in the former City of Oakleigh and its suburbs.

The area is traditionally known to have a strong Greek cultural influence, largely due to the influx of immigrants to Australia in the mid-20th century. Thirteen per cent of those living in the suburb speak only Greek at home.

Although the origin of the name of the suburb, &quot;Oakleigh,&quot; is unclear, local historians have three main theories – that it was derived from she-oaks that grew near Scotchmans Creek; from &quot;Oakleigh Park&quot; an estate near Malvern Hills in England; or from Mrs Oakley, an early settler.

==History==

Originally inhabited by the Kulin people, a grazing run was established in the settled district east of Melbourne in the early 1840s, for which the lease was taken up by farmers John and Archibald McMillan. Scotchman&#x27;s Creek Run, as it became known, was named after the Scottish settlers in the area in and near the run (including the McMillan, Campbell, and McPherson families). By 1853, Scotchman&#x27;s Creek was known as South Yarra Creek, due to the well known South Yarra Pound (built in the area in the early 1840s on behalf of the government to collect stray livestock) and the associated South Yarra Inn. Part of the Parish of Mulgrave, County of Bourke, Oakleigh was first surveyed in 1853, and the first blocks of land were sold soon after. Oakleigh Post Office opened on 1 August 1854.

The Shire of Oakleigh was created in 1871 and a boom in settlement followed the opening of the Melbourne-Oakleigh railway line in 1877.

Oakleigh, along with Dandenong, soon became one of the closest large cities to Melbourne, and the key to its development was the railway line to Melbourne. Railway workshops, brick works (until 1953, the area supplied 20% of Melbourne&#x27;s bricks), sand mining, and market gardens became the most important industries in Oakleigh at the end of the 19th century. The suburb contributed greatly to Melbourne&#x27;s rapid growth, and as a result, Oakleigh has a legacy of many large old buildings and institutions, mostly located between the railway line and the main road at Dandenong Road (which once serviced the city).

The Oakleigh Hall (formerly the Mechanics&#x27; Institute) which once served as the town hall (1906), post office (1924) and courthouse (1934) still remains, as does a grandstand of the cricket and football oval. The Sacred Heart Church, a large Edwardian church with its twin copper dome, is still a landmark of the area and is now part of a school.

Oakleigh&#x27;s urban potential was increased by the addition of part of Caulfield, comprising present day Hughesdale, in 1913. In 1924 Oakleigh was proclaimed a town and on 2 August 1927, a city. By then the Oakleigh area was substantially built up, and housing was extending to Hughesdale and Huntingdale (East Oakleigh) in the vicinity of their railway station. At the close of the war these areas were described as rising suburbs. Because the land in Oakleigh South was sandy and fairly flat – suitable for golf courses – Oakleigh South was the home of Sand Belt private golf courses such as the Metropolitan, Commonwealth, and Huntingdale Golf Clubs.

The Convent of the Good Shepherd occupied the northernmost boundary of the city until it was demolished in 1984 to make way for the extensions of Chadstone Shopping Centre. Chadstone Shopping Centre opened in 1960 and was constructed on land that was initially leased from the Good Shepherd Sisters for 99 years. In 1983 the whole site was purchased from the congregation. Chadstone Shopping Centre is now part of Malvern East. Chadstone Shopping Centre was built about 1.5 kilometres from the Oakleigh shopping centre. Although trading in the three or four active street in the Oakleigh shopping centre was maintained with one-way traffic and pedestrianisation, the contrast with climate-controlled Chadstone was apparent.

The Oakleigh General Cemetery was in operation from 1860 until 1960. It is situated in Oakleigh Pioneer Memorial Park.

The Oakleigh library, now a branch of Monash Public Library, was moved to its current location on Drummond Street in 1967 and a new foyer integrated it with the old Mechanics Institute Hall and Senior Citizens rooms.

Oakleigh Primary School No. 1601 was established in 1875. The lower-school is situated in a renovated building (first opened in 1914). The middle and upper school are situated in the modern building (opened in 1977). The school opened a purpose-built kindergarten in 2005 for 3- and 4-year-old children. In 2011, a Performing Arts Centre was added, it being built out of concrete and having an iron roof, and in 2017, portable classrooms were placed on the tennis courts to cater to the ever-expanding school. Since 2011, Jack Fisher was the principal of the school, but he resigned in 2017.

The Oakleigh Motel, the first of its kind, and an example of Googie architecture, was opened in time for the 1956 Summer Olympics. The building was on the Monash Council heritage register, but despite this the council granted permission to demolish it. Heritage Victoria has since granted provisional heritage status to the building. The motel ushered in an era when the motor car dominated the city as Melbourne sprawled and expanded to absorb Oakleigh and also Dandenong into its ever-expanding south-eastern conurbation.

Oakleigh was defined as a Major Activity Centre as part of the Melbourne 2030 planning policy.

==Demographics and housing==

The area is traditionally known to have a strong Greek cultural influence, largely due to the influx of said immigrants to Australia in the mid-20th century. Fourteen percent of those living in the suburb speak Greek at home.
Evidence of Greek cultural influence can be found in the Oakleigh Cannons football club, which was established in 1972 by Greek immigrants. Further evidence of Greek cultural influence can be found in the Greek Orthodox church of Agioi Anargyroi.

==Central Business District==

Oakleigh has a large historic Central Business District spanning some nine city blocks. Atherton Road is Oakleigh&#x27;s historic commercial main street while Drummond Street is its former civic spine. This area contains many older commercial buildings including banks and retail complexes dating back to the early days of the city. There are a small number of multi-storey office buildings which date back to the city&#x27;s growth period.

Eaton Street is a pedestrian mall which connects Atherton Road with the Centro Shopping Centre and railway station. The CBD is a popular activity centre with locals with a great many cafes, several hotels, restaurants and retail shops. The thriving shopping district has an abundance of butchers, bakeries, beauty salons, and specialty shops selling sweets. There are also multiple laneways with Greek-themed cafés that specialise in café frappé. A police station, primary school, public Library, RSL, Community Hall and historical centre (Monash Federation Centre) Cemetery and football ground and park are in the nearby historical precinct of Drummond Street.

A smaller commercial area developed along Dandenong Road. Both centres continue to develop.

==Transport==

The main form of transport in Oakleigh is the private vehicle. Major roads in the suburb include Dandenong Road (Princes Highway), Ferntree Gully Road and Warrigal Road.

Oakleigh railway station provides suburban railway services on both the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines.

Oakleigh is also the hub of a large component of Melbourne&#x27;s eastern bus network. Many of the buses interchange at a terminus alongside the railway station and follow routes which run through the suburb.

Bicycle transport is facilitated by a network of on-road and also segregated bicycle facilities.

==Sport==

An association football club, the Oakleigh Cannons FC, competes in the Australian second-tier competition, the National Premier League.

The suburb has two Australian rules football clubs, namely the Oakleigh Chargers TAC Cup team and the Oakleigh Amateur Football Club.

The former Oakleigh Football Club was the city&#x27;s most popular sporting team, and competed in the Victorian Football Association from 1929 until its dissolution in 1994.

Golfers play at the Oakleigh Golf Club on Park Road.

The Oakleigh Recreation Centre is the suburbs primary indoor sporting facility, offering the council&#x27;s 176,000 residents and those of nearby municipalities&#x27; state of the art recreational facilities and an array of pools to improve community health and activity.

<doc id="617210" wikidata="Q45355603" url="?curid=617210" title="Aminoglycoside">
<text>Aminoglycoside is a medicinal and bacteriologic category of traditional Gram-negative antibacterial medications that inhibit protein synthesis and contain as a portion of the molecule an amino-modified glycoside (sugar). The term can also refer more generally to any organic molecule that contains amino sugar substructures. Aminoglycoside antibiotics display bactericidal activity against Gram-negative aerobes and some anaerobic bacilli where resistance has not yet arisen but generally not against Gram-positive and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria.

Streptomycin is the first-in-class aminoglycoside antibiotic. It is derived from &quot;Streptomyces griseus&quot; and is the earliest modern agent used against tuberculosis. Streptomycin lacks the common 2-deoxystreptamine moiety (image right, below) present in most other members of this class. Other examples of aminoglycosides include the deoxystreptamine-containing agents kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, and neomycin (see below).
==Nomenclature==
Aminoglycosides that are derived from bacteria of the &quot;Streptomyces&quot; genus are named with the suffix &quot;-mycin&quot;, whereas those that are derived from &quot;Micromonospora&quot; are named with the suffix &quot;-micin&quot;. However, this nomenclature system is not specific for aminoglycosides, and so appearance of this set of suffixes does not imply common mechanism of action. (For instance, vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, and erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic produced by &quot;Saccharopolyspora erythraea&quot;, along with its synthetic derivatives clarithromycin and azithromycin, all share the suffixes but have notably different mechanisms of action.)

In the following gallery, kanamycin A to netilmicin are examples of the 4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamine sub-class of aminoglycosides, the neomycins are examples of the 4,&quot;5&quot;-disubstituted sub-class, and streptomycin is an example of a non-deoxystreptamine aminoglycoside.
==Mechanisms of action==

Aminoglycosides display concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against &quot;most gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacilli&quot; but not against gram-negative anaerobes and most gram-positive bacteria. They require only short contact time, and are most effective against susceptible bacterial populations that are rapidly multiplying. These activities are attributed to a primary mode of action as protein synthesis inhibitors, though additional mechanisms are implicated for some specific agents, and/or thorough mechanistic descriptions are as yet unavailable.

The inhibition of protein synthesis is mediated through aminoglycosides&#x27; energy-dependent, sometimes irreversible binding, to the cytosolic, membrane-associated bacterial ribosome (image at right). (Aminoglycosides first cross bacterial cell walls—lipopolysaccharide in gram-negative bacteria—and cell membranes, where they are actively transported.) While specific steps in protein synthesis affected may vary somewhat between specific aminoglycoside agents, as can their affinity and degree of binding, aminoglycoside presence in the cytosol generally disturbs peptide elongation at the 30S ribosomal subunit, giving rise to inaccurate mRNA translation and therefore biosynthesis of proteins that are truncated, or bear altered amino acid compositions at particular points. Specifically, binding impairs translational proofreading leading to misreading of the RNA message, premature termination, or both, and so to inaccuracy of the translated protein product. The subset of aberrant proteins that are incorporated into the bacterial cell membrane may then lead to changes in its permeability and then to &quot;further stimulation of aminoglycoside transport&quot;. The amino sugar portion of this class of molecules (e.g., the 2-deoxystreptamine in kanamycins, gentamicins, and tobramycin, see above) are implicated in the association of the small molecule with ribosomal structures that lead to the infidelities in translation (ibid.). Inhibition of ribosomal translocation—i.e., movement of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A- to the P-site—has also been suggested. Recent single-molecule tracking experiments in live &quot;E. coli&quot; showed an ongoing but slower protein synthesis upon treatment with different aminoglycoside drugs. (Spectinomycin, a related but distinct chemical structure class often discussed with aminoglycosides, does not induce mRNA misreading and is generally not bactericidal.)

It has been proposed that aminoglycoside antibiotics cause oxidation of guanine nucleotides in the bacterial nucleotide pool, and that this contributes to the cytotoxicity of these antibiotics. The incorporation of oxidized guanine nucleotides into DNA could be bactericidal since incomplete repair of closely spaced 8-oxo-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine in the DNA can result in lethal double-strand breaks.

Finally, a further &quot;cell-membrane effect&quot; also occurs with aminoglycosides; &quot;functional integrity of the bacterial cell membrane&quot; can be lost, later in time courses of aminoglycoside exposure and transport.

===Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics===
There is a significant variability in the relationship between the dose administered and the resultant plasma level in blood. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is necessary to obtain the correct dose. These agents exhibit a post-antibiotic effect in which there is no or very little drug level detectable in blood, but there still seems to be inhibition of bacterial re-growth. This is due to strong, irreversible binding to the ribosome, and remains intracellular long after plasma levels drop, and allows a prolonged dosage interval. Depending on their concentration, they act as bacteriostatic or bactericidal agents.

===Indications===
Aminoglycosides are useful primarily in infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Acinetobacter&quot;, and &quot;Enterobacter&quot;. In addition, some &quot;Mycobacteria&quot;, including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Streptomycin was the first effective drug in the treatment of tuberculosis, though the role of aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and amikacin has been eclipsed (because of their toxicity and inconvenient route of administration) except for multiple-drug-resistant strains. The most frequent use of aminoglycosides is empiric therapy for serious infections such as sepsis, complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Usually, once cultures of the causal organism are grown and their susceptibilities tested, aminoglycosides are discontinued in favor of less toxic antibiotics.

As noted, aminoglycosides are mostly ineffective against anaerobic bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria can also be treated with aminoglycosides, but other types of antibiotics are more potent and less damaging to the host. In the past, the aminoglycosides have been used in conjunction with beta-lactam antibiotics in streptococcal infections for their synergistic effects, in particular in endocarditis. One of the most frequent combinations is ampicillin (a beta-lactam, or penicillin-related antibiotic) and gentamicin. Often, hospital staff refer to this combination as &quot;amp and gent&quot; or more recently called &quot;pen and gent&quot; for penicillin and gentamicin.

===Nonsense suppression===
The interference with mRNA proofreading has been exploited to treat genetic diseases that result from premature stop codons (leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins). Aminoglycosides can cause the cell to overcome the stop codons, insert a random amino acid, and express a full-length protein. The aminoglycoside gentamicin has been used to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) cells in the laboratory to induce them to grow full-length proteins. CF is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the &quot;cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator&quot; (&quot;CFTR&quot;) protein. In approximately 10% of CF cases, the mutation in this gene causes its early termination during translation, leading to the formation of a truncated and non-functional CFTR protein. It is believed that gentamicin distorts the structure of the ribosome-RNA complex, leading to a mis-reading of the termination codon, causing the ribosome to &quot;skip&quot; over the stop sequence and to continue with the normal elongation and production of the CFTR protein.

==Routes of administration==
Since they are not absorbed from the gut, they are administered intravenously and intramuscularly. Some are used in topical preparations for wounds. Oral administration can be used for gut decontamination (e.g., in hepatic encephalopathy). Tobramycin may be administered in a nebulized form.

==Clinical use==
The recent emergence of infections due to Gram-negative bacterial strains with advanced patterns of antimicrobial resistance has prompted physicians to reevaluate the use of these antibacterial agents. This revived interest in the use of aminoglycosides has brought back to light the debate on the two major issues related to these compounds, namely the spectrum of antimicrobial susceptibility and toxicity. Current evidence shows that aminoglycosides do retain activity against the majority of Gram-negative clinical bacterial isolates in many parts of the world. Still, the relatively frequent occurrence of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity during aminoglycoside treatment makes physicians reluctant to use these compounds in everyday practice. Recent advances in the understanding of the effect of various dosage schedules of aminoglycosides on toxicity have provided a partial solution to this problem, although more research still needs to be done in order to overcome this problem entirely.

Aminoglycosides are in pregnancy category D, that is, there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.

==Adverse effects==
Aminoglycosides can cause inner ear toxicity which can result in sensorineural hearing loss. The incidence of inner ear toxicity varies from 7 to 90%, depending on the types of antibiotics used, susceptibility of the patient to such antibiotics, and the duration of antibiotic administration.

Another serious and disabling side effect of aminoglycoside use is vestibular ototoxicity. This leads to oscillopsia (gaze instability) and balance impairments that impact all aspects of an individual&#x27;s antigravity function. This loss is permanent and can happen at any dose.

Frequent use of aminoglycosides could result in kidney damage (Acute kidney injury), that could lead to chronic kidney disease.

==Contraindication for specific diseases==
Aminoglycosides can exacerbate weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis, and use is therefore avoided in these patients.

Aminoglycosides are contraindicated in patients with mitochondrial diseases as they may result in impaired mtDNA translation, which can lead to irreversible hearing loss, tinnitus, cardiac toxicity, and renal toxicity. However, hearing loss and tinnitus have also been observed in some patients without mitochondrial diseases.

<text>Wheelers Hill is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 23 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Monash local government area. Wheelers Hill recorded a population of 20,652 at the .

At 152m above sea level it includes one of the highest points in metropolitan Melbourne.

==History==

Wheelers Hill was named after James Wheeler in 1888, who was an early settler in the Dandenong area. James came out from Kilbride townland, Cavan, Ireland. James married Ellen Reilly née Glynn in 1848 after the death of her husband, Bernard. There was a five-room house on a creek that went down to the Dandenong Creek not far down the road from the Post Office. James had a disagreement with Joseph Jell about the cutting of trees which led to the lands being surveyed. James sold the land in 1854 and moved to Woodend.

The Wheelers Hill Hotel was a post office and stopping point for farmers before a 6 to 8-hour drive to the city by horse to sell their goods. The Wheelers Mansion was destroyed by a fire in the late 1920s. The house was located somewhere to the south of the Wheelers Hill Library. The Post Office opened on 1 January 1869 but was called Mulgrave until 1888.

==Today==
Wheelers Hill is home to Jells Park, a major recreational facility of over 127 hectares. It contains 9 km of cycle paths and walking tracks which surround a large lake. Wheelers Hill is known for its trees.

==Public library and art gallery==

The Museum of Australian Photography and the Wheelers Hill branch of the Monash Public Library Service co-located in a building at the corner of Jells Road and Ferntree Gully Road, Wheelers Hill. The architect of the original 1990 Gallery was Harry Seidler. Even though Seidler had designed a further whole cultural precinct beyond the gallery, Seidler&#x27;s designs for a complete cultural centre were never implemented. Later architects Cox Sanderson Ness designed the adjoining library which has a bay of windows facing a small lake. The Gallery contains a nationally significant collection of Australian photography, of which its permanent collection comprises over 1500 works illustrating the development and evolution of the photographic medium in Australia.

<doc id="617213" wikidata="Q1575272" url="?curid=617213" title="Sablefish">
<text>The sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) is one of two members of the fish family Anoplopomatidae and the only species in the genus Anoplopoma. In English, common names for it include sable (US), butterfish (US), black cod (US, UK, Canada), blue cod (UK), bluefish (UK), candlefish (UK), coal cod (UK), snowfish (; Thailand), coalfish (Canada), beshow, and skil (Canada), although many of these names also refer to other, unrelated, species. The US Food and Drug Administration accepts only &quot;sablefish&quot; as the acceptable market name in the United States; &quot;black cod&quot; is considered a vernacular (regional) name and should not be used as a statement of identity for this species. The sablefish is found in muddy sea beds in the North Pacific Ocean at depths of and is commercially important to Japan.

==Description==

The sablefish is a species of deep-sea fish common to the North Pacific Ocean. Adult sablefish are opportunistic piscivores, preying on Alaskan pollock, eulachon, capelin, herring, sandlance, and Pacific cod, as well as squid, euphausiids, and jellyfish. Sablefish are long-lived, with a maximum recorded age of 94 years although the majority of the commercial catch in many areas is less than 20 years old.

Sablefish growth varies regionally, with larger maximum sizes in Alaska, where total lengths up to weights up to have been recorded. However, average lengths are typically below and .

Tagging studies have indicated that sablefish have been observed to move as much as before recapture with one study estimating an average distance between release and recapture of , with an average annual movement of .

==Fisheries==
Sablefish are typically caught in bottom trawl, longline and pot fisheries. In the Northeast Pacific, sablefish fisheries are managed separately in three areas: Alaska, the Canadian province of British Columbia, and the west coast of the contiguous United States (Washington, Oregon, and California). In all these areas catches peaked in the 1970s and 80s and have been lower since that time due to a combination of reduced populations and management restrictions. The sablefish longline fishery in Alaska has been certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council as is the US West Coast limited entry groundfish trawl fishery which includes sablefish.

Longline fisheries in Alaska frequently experience predation of sablefish by killer whales and sperm whales which remove the fish from the hooks during the process of retrieving the gear.

Sablefish aquaculture is an area of active research.

==Culinary use==
The white flesh of the sablefish is soft-textured and mildly flavored. It is considered a delicacy in many countries. When cooked, its flaky texture is similar to Patagonian toothfish (Chilean sea bass). The meat has a high fat content and can be prepared in many ways, including grilling, smoking, or frying, or served as sushi. Sablefish flesh is high in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA, and DHA. It contains about as much as wild salmon.

Smoked sablefish, often called simply &quot;sable&quot;, has long been a staple of New York appetizing stores, one of many smoked fish products usually eaten with bagels for breakfast in American Jewish cuisine.

In Japanese cuisine, the black cod (&quot;gindara&quot;) is often cooked &quot;saikyo yaki&quot; style, marinated for several days in sweet white &quot;miso&quot; or sake lees (&quot;kasuzuke&quot;) then broiled. The Japanese-Peruvian-American chef Nobu Matsuhisa introduced his version of &quot;gindara saikyo yaki&quot; at his restaurant in Los Angeles, and brought it to his New York restaurant &quot;Nobu&quot; in 1994, where it is considered his signature dish, under the name &quot;Black Cod with Miso&quot;. Kasuzuke sablefish is popular in Seattle thanks to a large Japanese community in that area.

==Nutrition==
Nutritional information for sablefish is as follows.

=== Mercury content ===
Studies of accumulated mercury levels find average mercury concentrations from 0.1 ppm, 0.2 ppm, and up to 0.4 ppm. The US Food and Drug Administration puts sablefish in the &quot;Good Choices&quot; category in their guide for pregnant women and parents, and recommends one 4-ounce serving (uncooked) a week for an adult, less for children. On the other hand, the Alaska epidemiology section considers Alaska sablefish to be &quot;low in mercury&quot; and advises no restrictions on sablefish consumption by all populations.

<doc id="617214" wikidata="Q965465" url="?curid=617214" title="Kilgore Trout">
<text>Kilgore Trout is a fictional character created by author Kurt Vonnegut (1922–2007). Trout is a notably unsuccessful author of paperback science fiction novels.

&quot;Trout&quot; was inspired by the name of the author Theodore Sturgeon (1918–1985), Vonnegut&#x27;s colleague in the genre of science fiction. Vonnegut was amused by the notion of a person with the name of a fish, and hence substituted &quot;Trout&quot; for &quot;Sturgeon&quot;. Trout&#x27;s appearances in a number of Vonnegut&#x27;s works have led critics to also view the character as the author&#x27;s own alter ego.

In an homage to Vonnegut, Kilgore Trout is also the ostensible author of the novel &quot;Venus on the Half-Shell&quot; (1975), written pseudonymously by Philip José Farmer.

==Origins of the character==
The impetus to create Kilgore Trout as a character, Vonnegut suggested in a 1979 NYPR interview, was the convenience it offered to turn science-fiction plots into humorous parables. &quot;Kilgore Trout was more or less invented by a friend of mine, Knox Burger, who was my editor in the early days. He did not suggest that I do this, but he said, &#x27;You know, the problem with science-fiction? It&#x27;s much more fun to hear someone tell the story of the book than to read the story itself.&#x27; And it&#x27;s true: If you paraphrase a science-fiction story, it comes out as a very elegant joke, and it&#x27;s over in a minute or so. It&#x27;s a tedious business to read all the surrounding material. So I started summarizing [them], and I suppose I&#x27;ve now summarized 50 novels I will never have to write, and spared people the reading of them.&quot;

In 1957, Theodore Sturgeon moved to Truro, Massachusetts, where he befriended Vonnegut, then working as a salesman in a Saab dealership. At the time, both were writing in the genre of science fiction; Vonnegut had already published &quot;Player Piano&quot;, retitled &quot;Utopia 14&quot; in paperback, while Sturgeon&#x27;s then more-successful career (mainly as a short-story writer) stretched back to 1938. In fact, at the time of their initial meeting, Sturgeon was the most anthologized English-language science fiction author alive.

Sturgeon would continue writing, but his pace dipped noticeably after the end of the 1950s, and he published no original novels after 1961. By the time of Kilgore Trout&#x27;s first appearance (in 1965&#x27;s &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;), both Vonnegut and Sturgeon had moved to different cities, and Vonnegut had begun to be perceived as a mainstream author.

The &quot;Kilgore Trout&quot; name was a transparent reference to the older writer (substituting &quot;Kilgore&quot; for &quot;Theodore&quot; and &quot;Trout&quot; for &quot;Sturgeon&quot;), but since the characterization was less than flattering (both Sturgeon and Trout were financially unsuccessful and seemingly slipping into obscurity), Vonnegut did not publicly state the connection, nor did Sturgeon encourage the comparison. It was not until after Sturgeon&#x27;s death in 1985 that Vonnegut explicitly acknowledged the matter, stating in a 1987 interview that &quot;Yeah, it said so in his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. I was delighted that it said in the middle of it that he was the inspiration for the Kurt Vonnegut character of Kilgore Trout.&quot;

While Sturgeon did not resemble Trout in many respects, there were some points of similarity. According to &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;: Like poor Kilgore Trout, Sturgeon often saw his best work emblazoned with awful titles conjured up by hasty editors — titles such as &quot;The Incubi of Parallel X&quot; (which Sturgeon called &quot;the most horrible title to appear over my byline&quot;) or &quot;The Cosmic Rape&quot; or even the mega-awful &quot;The Synthetic Man&quot;, that cruel paperback retitling of Sturgeon&#x27;s greatest and most intricate novel, &quot;The Dreaming Jewels&quot;. At first glance, a typical Sturgeon collection might look from afar as awful as something by Kilgore Trout. But once you read the first page, you knew you were in the hands of someone who never wrote a bad sentence.

== Appearances in Vonnegut books ==
Trout appears in several of Vonnegut&#x27;s books, but the character is deliberately inconsistent as Vonnegut habitually changes major details about his life and circumstances with each appearance. Trout is consistently presented as a prolific but unappreciated science-fiction writer; other details, including his general appearance, demeanor and his dates of birth and death, vary widely from novel to novel. (Perhaps the most extreme instance of this occurs in &quot;Jailbird&quot;, wherein &quot;Kilgore Trout&quot; is merely a pseudonym of Dr. Robert Fender, a novelist and prison inmate.) Vonnegut makes no attempt to reconcile these sometimes extreme differences, and his novels do not form an internally consistent world.

Trout performs a variety of roles in Vonnegut&#x27;s works: he acts as a catalyst for the main characters in &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, and &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, while in others, such as &quot;Jailbird&quot; and &quot;Timequake&quot;, Trout is an active character who is vital to the story. Trout is also described differently in several books; in &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, he has, by the end, become something of a father figure, while in other novels, he seems to be something like Vonnegut in the early part of his career. In &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, Trout is not mentioned by name, but the protagonist is deeply affected while reading a Trout-like science fiction story. In early novels, Kilgore Trout lives in Ilium, New York, a fictional town whose name is based on Troy, New York (Illium was the Roman name for ancient Troy and Vonnegut lived and worked in nearby Schenectady for some time). In later novels, Trout inhabits a basement apartment in Cohoes, an ailing mill community. While living in Cohoes, Trout works as an installer of &quot;aluminum combination storm windows and screens.&quot; The ghost of Trout&#x27;s son, Leon Trotsky Trout, is the narrator of the novel &quot;Galápagos&quot;.

Trout, who has supposedly written over 117 novels and over 2,000 short stories, is usually described as an unappreciated science fiction writer whose works are used only as filler material in pornographic magazines. However, he does have at least three fans: Eliot Rosewater and Billy Pilgrim—both Vonnegut characters—have a near-complete collection of Trout&#x27;s work or have read most of his work; in &quot;Galápagos&quot;, Leon Trotsky Trout goes on leave in Thailand and meets an unnamed Swedish doctor who is a fan of Kilgore Trout. This doctor helps Leon desert the U.S. Marine Corps and defect to Sweden, where he receives political asylum as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War.

Vonnegut revised Trout&#x27;s biography on several occasions. In &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, he is born in 1907 and dies in 1981. In &quot;Timequake&quot;, he lives from 1917 to 2001. Both death dates are set in the future as of the time the novels were written. More recently, in an article for &quot;In These Times&quot; Vonnegut &quot;reports&quot; that Kilgore Trout commits suicide by drinking Drāno. Trout &quot;dies&quot; at midnight on October 15, 2004, in Cohoes following his consultation with a psychic, who informs him that George W. Bush would once again win the U. S. Presidential election by a vote of 5-to-4 in the Supreme Court. The epitaph on his tombstone reads, &quot;Life is no way to treat an animal.&quot;

In &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, Kilgore Trout has part of his right ring finger bitten off by the book&#x27;s other main character, Dwayne Hoover, when Kilgore attends an arts festival in the Midwest. Trout also has an encounter with his creator, Mr. Vonnegut, in the final chapter. Vonnegut tells him that he is setting him free, in much the same way that Leo Tolstoy freed his serfs, and that the rest of his life will be much happier: his work will be republished by reputable publishers, and his ideas will become very influential, leading to him winning the Nobel Prize for medicine. However, Vonnegut cannot grant Trout&#x27;s request to &quot;make me young.&quot;

In &quot;Jailbird&quot; (1979), Kilgore Trout is revealed to be the only lifer in the Federal Minimum Security Adult Correctional Facility near Finletter Air Force Base, Georgia. &quot;Jailbird&quot;, narrated by the fictional character Walter F. Starbuck, shows Kilgore Trout to be the only American convicted of treason during the Korean War. Kilgore Trout is the pseudonym of (the equally fictional) Dr. Robert Fender, whose doctorate is in veterinary science. While in prison, Fender also writes many science fiction novels under another pseudonym, Frank X. Barlow, and works as the chief clerk in the supply room of the prison.

&quot;Galápagos&quot; is narrated by Leon Trotsky Trout (1946–1986), the son and only child of Kilgore Trout. Leon ran away at the age of 16, ashamed of his father, and never had any contact with him thereafter, until his death, when Kilgore appeared at the door of the &quot;blue tunnel&quot; that leads to the Afterlife. Kilgore appears at the door to the tunnel, urging his son to enter and proceed to the Afterlife. Three times Leon refuses, on the grounds that he wants to see more of human life in the hope of understanding it. During Kilgore&#x27;s fourth appearance at the entrance to the blue tunnel, he threatens his son: if Leon doesn&#x27;t leave the Earth immediately, the blue tunnel won&#x27;t appear again for one million years. Since Kilgore has never lied to Leon, Leon knows this will come true. He is momentarily distracted by events on Earth, and the tunnel disappears. &quot;Galápagos&quot; contains several flashback scenes that explain the breakup between Kilgore and his wife. Leon states that he became a US Marine because his father was one. Trout&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Galápagos&quot; is somewhat problematic for Vonnegut&#x27;s continuity because the novel explicitly states that Kilgore dies before 1986, when the events of the novel take place. Yet &quot;Timequake&quot; finds him alive more than ten years later. In &quot;Galápagos&quot;, Leon uses his omniscient status as a ghost to confirm that he never fathered a child, so that Kilgore never had any descendants.

In &quot;Timequake,&quot; Kilgore&#x27;s creed is &quot;You were sick, but now you are well again. And there&#x27;s work to be done.&quot; The novel also features Trout&#x27;s last and presumably only poem:

It is stated in &quot;Timequake&quot; that Trout&#x27;s father killed his mother when Trout was 12. This influences Trout later in life, when he is shown to say the phrase &quot;ting-a-ling&quot; whenever greeted or asked any questions.

Trout accidentally becomes a great hero, rescuing many lives after the timequake, and finally receives a measure of acclaim: he spends his last days in a literary colony, honored for his heroism and some of his discarded works, which were preserved by a security guard.

In &quot;A Man Without a Country&quot;, Vonnegut receives a brief phone call on January 20, 2004, from Kilgore Trout in which they discuss George W. Bush&#x27;s State of the Union Address and the imminent death of the Earth due to human carelessness.

In &quot;God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian&quot;, Vonnegut&#x27;s final interview is with Trout.

== In other works ==
At least one actual published work is attributed to Kilgore Trout: the novel &quot;Venus on the Half-Shell&quot;, written by Philip José Farmer but published under the name &quot;Kilgore Trout&quot;. For some time it was assumed that Vonnegut must have written it. Richard E. Geis, publisher of the semi-pro zine &quot;Science Fiction Review&quot; wrote a review under the assumption that Vonnegut had written the novel. Vonnegut, unhappy with the content of the review, later contacted Geis via an obscenity filled phonecall to convey his displeasure at Geis&#x27; review and personal comments about him.

Trout was portrayed by Albert Finney in the 1999 film adaptation of &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, directed by Alan Rudolph.

<doc id="617215" wikidata="Q880513" url="?curid=617215" title="Black Rock, Victoria">
<text>Black Rock is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 18 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Bayside local government area. Black Rock recorded a population of 6,389 at the 2021 census.

==History==
The suburb was named after Black Rock House, a grand residence built by Charles Ebden in 1856, who had taken the name from Black Rock, Dublin. Ebden was an early Port Phillip pastoralist as well as being a businessman and parliamentarian representing the seat of Brighton in the Victorian Parliament. Black Rock House is on the Register of the National Estate.

The northern part of the suburb between Beach Road and Bluff Road was one of the early estates in the parish of Moorabbin developed by Josiah Holloway in the 1850s. Named Bluff Town, sales were slower than in other areas and the suburb grew slowly.

One of the notable characteristics of the Black Rock shoreline is Red Bluff. The bluff&#x27;s name comes from the oxidised iron in the cliffs which gives off a burnt orange colour. Either side of Red Bluff are many popular beaches and seaside destinations, including Half Moon Bay, a setting for yachting since the 1890s. A branch of the Brighton Yacht Club formed the Black Rock Yacht Club in 1919. A rock breakwater was constructed and in 1926 the hull of the colonial naval vessel HMVS Cerberus was added to further protect the boat haven.

In 1888, the year after the railway was extended to Sandringham, a horse tram was provided between Sandringham and Black Rock, running on to Beaumaris. The service, which lasted until 1914, was replaced by an electric tram service (operated by the Victorian Railways) in 1919, which ran slightly inland of the horse tram service. In 1931, the line was cut back to Black Rock, and the entire line closed in 1956. In 1910 a State primary school was opened in Black Rock which continues to operate to this day.

The first Post Office in the area was Red Bluff to the north, which opened on 17 April 1901 and closed in 1969. The first Black Rock Post Office opened on 23 April 1902, was renamed Half Moon Bay in 1922 and closed in 1968. The second Black Rock Post Office opened in 1922 near the corner of Bluff Road and Balcombe Road.

==Today==
Like many neighbouring suburbs, the residential development in Black Rock dates partly in the postwar period and due to active conservation movements for the protection of native plants beside roads and on heathlands, Black Rock boasts beautiful surrounds. There are many recreational reserves located throughout the shoreline and near the town centre. The major shopping centre in Black Rock, located at the intersection of Bluff, Beach and Balcombe Roads is home to the prominent Black Rock Clock Tower.

==Population==
In the 2016 Census, there were 6,159 people in Black Rock. 71.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 6.6% and New Zealand 1.9%. 83.8% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek at 2.2%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 38.1%, Catholic 21.4% and Anglican 15.8%.

==Landmarks==
* The HMVS Cerberus - A breakwater in Half Moon Bay formed by the sunken wreck of Australia&#x27;s first ironclad warship, HMVS Cerberus
* Black Rock Clock Tower - A large four sided public clock mounted on a tall brick structure in the middle of a roundabout at the intersection of Beach Road and Balcombe Road. A popular starting point for cycle rides along Beach Road including the (in)famous &quot;Hell Ride&quot;.

<text>Brighton is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 11 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Bayside local government area. Brighton recorded a population of 23,252 at the 2021 census.

Brighton is named after Brighton in England.

==History==
In England, on 29 August 1840, Henry Dendy (1800–81) purchased of Port Phillip land at £1 per acre, sight unseen, under the terms of the short-lived Special Survey regulations. Dendy arrived on 5 February 1841 to claim his land. The area was known as Dendy&#x27;s Special Survey.

The area Dendy was compelled to take, called &quot;Waterville&quot;, was bound by the coastline to the west and the present day North Road, East Boundary Road and South Road. A town was surveyed in mid-1841, defined by the crescent-shaped street layout which remains today, and subdivided allotments were offered for sale. The area soon became the &quot;Brighton Estate&quot;, and Dendy&#x27;s site for his own home was named &quot;Brighton Park&quot;. Unfortunately, the land did not have any ready sources of water. Sales were slow at first, and the financial depression came and Dendy&#x27;s scheme for emigration and land sales failed. The family of his agent Jonathan Binns Were (1809–85) who had arrived in Melbourne in 1839, bought the land. All of Dendy&#x27;s business ventures failed, and he died a pauper.

After the depression, sales of land resulted in Brighton becoming the third most populated town in the Port Phillip District (after Melbourne and Portland), by 1846. Brighton attracted wealthy residents who wanted generous building sites and the prospect of sea bathing. By the late 1840s stately homes were built in an area known as &#x27;The Terrace&#x27;, now called the Esplanade, overlooking Dendy Street Beach. The Brighton Post Office opened on 19 April 1853.

St Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Church, Brighton, one of the earliest churches in Victoria, was founded in 1842. Wesleyan and Catholic churches followed by 1848, and a Methodist church in 1851. Schools were opened on the Anglican Church land (1849) and by the Catholic Church in Centre Road (1850). Another was opened in the Wesleyan Church in 1855. In 1854, Brighton had a census population of 2,731.

A railway connection to Melbourne was built in stages: Windsor to North Brighton was completed in 1859 and connected to the loop line to St Kilda station; the connection to Melbourne was made in 1860; and the line was extended from North Brighton to Brighton Beach in 1861. A single line railway-tram from St Kilda to Brighton Beach was completed in 1906. The railway tramline was duplicated in 1914. In 1919 the railway was electrified. A tram ran down Hawthorn Road; the section from Glenhuntly to North Road was completed in 1925 and extended to Nepean Highway in 1937.

The noted bathing boxes in Brighton are known to have existed as far back as 1862, although the earliest ones were at the water&#x27;s edge at the end of Bay St rather than their present location on Dendy Street Beach just south of Middle Brighton. In 1906, the completion of a tram line from St Kilda to Brighton led to an increase in applications for bathing box permits and significant construction between 1908 and 1911; final numbers are uncertain, but between 100 and 200 bathing box sites may have been allocated prior to the Great Depression. As part of capital works programs during the Depression to help relieve unemployment, the City of Brighton, backed by State Government funding, relocated all bathing boxes to the high-water mark on Dendy Street Beach, or removed them completely. The boxes were relocated again in 1934 to their present position at the rear of this beach.

Two years after the opening of the railway line to Brighton Beach in 1861, Captain Kenny&#x27;s Brighton Beach Baths opened. At the time, bathing in the open during daylight hours was strictly prohibited, as was mixed bathing: separate sections of the beach were designated for men and for women. The baths were built off shore and were accessed by a wooden bridge, so that bathers would not have to cross the sand clad only in bathing costumes, but could gain entry straight into the water. Brighton Beach Baths had been destroyed several times, and were finally demolished in 1979. The Middle Brighton Municipal Baths were opened in 1881. The Baths are one of the only remaining caged open water sea baths in Australia.

On 18 January 1859, the municipality of Brighton was proclaimed extending eastwards between Dendy&#x27;s survey boundaries to Thomas Street and Nepean Highway. Brighton became a borough in October 1863, and in 1870 parts of Elwood and Elsternwick were added. Brighton became a town on 18 March 1887. It annexed from the City of Moorabbin on 3 April 1912 and became the City of Brighton on 12 March 1919. On 14 December 1994, the City of Brighton was incorporated in a new municipality called City of Bayside.

The Brighton Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 February 1985.

==Former cinemas==
===Prince George Theatre===
The Prince George Theatre was located in Church Street, Middle Brighton.

The building was originally built as the Caledonian Hall by David Munro in the late 19th century. It was first used as a public hall, doubling as a cinema when moving pictures were created in the first decade of the 20th Century. In 1920 the hall was refurbished, and reopened as the Grand Central Cinema. In October 1926 Robert McLeish Theatres of Swanston Street, Melbourne took over operations of the cinema, renaming it the Paramount. 

Bert Ward (born c.1907), had been running and the Hoyts Southern in Hampton, having also learnt projectionist skills. When the run-down Paramount was put on sale at a low price in 1928, he bought the theatre at the age of 21. With assistance from his family he made improvements, including central heating and quality sound equipment. 

In 1933, Ward renamed the cinema the Prince George Theatre (after the son of King George V and Queen Mary). A CinemaScope screen was installed in the 1950s, and with the introduction of television, the cinema, then under the management of Bert&#x27;s son Robert Ward, was also used to broadcast television programmes onto the big screen. At that time, the Ward family owned several cinemas, including the Burnley in Burnley; the Civic in Ashburton; the Mayfair in Gardenvale; the Prince George; and the Dendy Theatre. They also had interests in the Savoy in Russell Street, Melbourne. 

With the coming of television, Ward introduced a policy of showing arthouse films, probably the first such cinema to do so in Melbourne. However, with the Dendy Cinema increasingly difficult to maintain afloat financially, Robert Ward closed the Prince George, and instead turned the Dendy into an arthouse cinema. 

The building reopened as the Basin Street Jazz Centre, which closed in 1962. It then underwent various other changes and became derelict.

=== Dendy Theatre ===
The Dendy Theatre in Church Street, Middle Brighton, was built in 1940 and named after Henry Dendy, to designs in Art Deco style by Cowper Murphy Appleford. It was built on a site where Dendy made his first camp. It was built as a single-screen cinema with 1,172 seats, each with individual foot-warmers, and opened on 29 November 1940. It also included a crying room for mothers with young children. It was later known as the Dendy Cinema. 

The cinema was owned by Bert Ward (born c.1907), who passed his cinema industry knowledge and skills onto his son Robert Ward (died 2017). Under Robert, the Dendy cinema brand spread first into the city in Collins Street, then across the suburbs and interstate. Dendy Theatre was known as Dendy Cinema in the 1960s. Film screenings were regularly advertised in &quot;The Australian Jewish News&quot;, which reported in 1966 that &quot;generous concessions&quot; were available to Jewish organisations for group bookings.

In March 1966 the cinema underwent a major renovation and upgrade of its equipment, costing A$45,000. It was fitted with 70 mm and Todd-AO widescreen equipment, with Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; the first film scheduled to be shown using the new equipment the following month. In April 1967, a three-manual, fifteen-rank Wurlitzer organ was installed in the theatre, after being transported from the Capitol Theatre in Swanston Street, Melbourne. The organ was officially opened by organist Horace Webber, who had first opened the instrument in 1924. It was played almost every night for around 15 years, and was featured on television. In December 1983 organ was removed ahead of demolition of the theatre in January 1984. 

In March 1969, American group The Platters, who were touring Australia, played live at the cinema over two weeks, along with screenings of the film &quot;Becket (1964 film)&quot;, starring Peter O&#x27;Toole and Richard Burton.

In 1979 Andrew Ward applied to replace the Dendy Cinema with a two-screen cinema complex, along with shops and offices. Redevelopment of the site began four years later and the new Dendy Centre opened on 30 April 1985. The cinema was called the Brighton Village Twin (also referred to as the Dendy Twin), with the organ eventually reinstalled in Cinema One in 1988.

The cinema closed for renovations in 2000, reopening as a multi-screen cinema in the same year. Screen 4 contained the organ. By 2009 it had expanded to include five cinemas, operated by Palace Cinemas as an arthouse cinema. In 2021 Palace Cinemas announced that the auditorium housing the organ would be converted into four screens, and that the organ would be reinstalled at The Capitol.

==Today==

On the beach, Beach Road is a popular cycling route, with the Bay Trail off-road walking/cycling tracks also following the coastline.

Dendy Street Beach, just south of Middle Brighton, features 82 colorful bathing boxes, which are one of the tourist icons of Melbourne. The boxes share a uniformity of size and build, and a regular arrangement along the beach, and are the only surviving such structures close to the Melbourne CBD. A Planning Scheme Heritage Overlay on the boxes by the Bayside City Council restricts alterations, and all retain their Victorian era architecture, such as timber frames, weatherboard sidings, and corrugated iron roofs, without amenities such electricity or running water. The bathing boxes may only be purchased by residents paying local council rates, and as of 2020 were selling for prices in the range of A$300,000 - 400,000 with annual council rates of around A$500, despite their lack of amenities. In 2009 plans were announced to build at least six new bathing boxes in an effort by the council to raise funds in excess of A$1 million during the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

Between Middle Brighton Beach and Sandown St Beach are the historic moderne Middle Brighton Municipal Baths, Royal Brighton Yacht Club, and the Middle Brighton Pier and breakwater. North Road in Brighton features many old churches and residences. The North Road Pavilion is a café which has an outlook of Port Phillip Bay, while the beachfront features views of the Melbourne city skyline.

There are two cinemas in Brighton, both owned by Palace Cinemas; one in Middle Brighton (on the site of the former Dendy Theatre), and the Palace Brighton cinema located at Bay Street, North Brighton.

The former Brighton Municipal Offices, now the Brighton library and council chamber, were designed by K. F. Knight in 1959-60 are a red brick miniature of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Guggenheim Museum in New York City. The interior furnishings were created by industrial designer Grant Featherston.

==Population==

In the 2016 Census, there were 23,253 people in Brighton. 68.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.4%, China 2.8%, New Zealand 1.7%, United States of America 1.2% and South Africa 1.1%. 79.0% of people spoke only English at home.

<doc id="617219" wikidata="Q5090177" url="?curid=617219" title="Cheltenham, Victoria">
<text>Cheltenham is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 18 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Bayside and Kingston local government areas. Cheltenham recorded a population of 23,992 at the 2021 census.

Cheltenham is currently undergoing significant gentrification and development. The eastern side of the area&#x27;s metropolitan railway line and Charman Road north is located within the City of Kingston, while the suburb&#x27;s western region towards extensive golf links, parks and Port Phillip Bay falls within the City of Bayside.

A significant feature in Cheltenham is Westfield Southland, a major shopping centre which opened in 1968.

==History==

The Boon Wurrung people had used natural springs in the area and when European settlers arrived they established market gardens and orchards nearby.

Cheltenham was one of the earliest areas to be settled in the parish of Moorabbin. It initially consisted of 625 acres of land purchased at auction by Josiah Morris Holloway on 11 May 1852. He subdivided this land into 370 allotments that were offered for sale in 1853. Many of the blocks were two acres in size and this gave the community its first name, Two Acre Village.

Lot 13 was purchased by Charles Whorrell for £20 and was located on the corner of Schnapper Point Road (Nepean Highway) and Centre Dandenong Road. On the allotment he built a hotel, the Cheltenham Inn, named after his home town in England, and a publican&#x27;s license was granted in 1854. It was probably the first public building in the community and is believed to have given its name to the settlement. It later became a coffee palace before being demolished in the 1930s. Another pub, the Armagh Hotel (Royal Oak), had been built on Schnapper Point Road by 1856. A third pub, the Exchange Hotel (Tudor Inn) had been built nearby on the highway by 1871. By 1880, a fortnightly sale of livestock and produce took place behind the hotel.

Sufficient population had settled for a Post Office to open on 1 August 1857. The community had a medical practitioner by November 1857, Dr Richard Goldstone (1802–1888). A Mechanics&#x27; Institute was opened in January 1865, with a Temperance Hall attached that could accommodate 300 people.

Local government began with the creation of the Moorabbin Roads Board in 1862. This became the Moorabbin Shire Council in 1871. Which in turn became the City of Moorabbin in October 1934. This became the City of Kingston in 1994 following a program of municipal amalgamations initiated by the state government. Cheltenham is the largest suburb in the municipality in terms of size and population and it contains the seat of local government.

Cheltenham Park dates to 1872, and was used for cricket and other recreational activities. In all, Cheltenham contains 13 parks that make up 5.3% of the suburb.

The area experienced a spurt of growth in the 1880s after the Cheltenham railway station opened in 1881. A branch of the English, Scottish and Australian Bank opened in 1885.
It was a substantial brick building on the corner of Nepean Highway and Goulburn St. It was still in use as a bank till the 1960s.

Much residential development occurred in the second half of the 1940s after World War II ended and this growth continued into the 1980s. The growing population of the area saw the construction of the Southland shopping centre on Nepean Highway in the mid 1960s. Cheltenham also has a large industrial area on the eastern edge and a smaller area at the far western edge. The western area is noted for Melbourne&#x27;s only lift test shaft.

In 1993, the landmark 7-storey 1230 Nepean Highway office tower was built. The City of Kingston leased spaced within the building for use as its main office before purchasing it in 2010.
==Population==

In the 2016 Census, there were 22,291 people in Cheltenham. 66.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.9%, China 2.8%, India 2.2%, Greece 2.2% and New Zealand 1.6%. 72.4% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 4.8%, Mandarin 3.1%, Russian 1.7%, Italian 1.5% and Hindi 0.8%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 34.2%, Catholic 23.6% and Anglican 10.3%.

==Health==

The Kingston centre is a large aged care and rehabilitation facility which opened on Warrigal Road, Cheltenham, in 1911 as the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum. It was known as the Cheltenham Home and Hospital for the Aged from 1965 through to 1970, before it was renamed to the Kingston Centre.The Heatherton Sanatorium with its entrance on Kingston Road (Heatherton, Victoria) is a now defunct sanatorium located behind the Kingston Centre and it operated for nearly 85 years, before it was closed in 1998.

In 2010, The Kingston Centre underwent a $46.3-million redevelopment, which was opened on 11 May 2012.

==Education==
There are six schools in the suburb of Cheltenham; five of which focus on Primary education with the remaining one focusing on Secondary education. They are:
* Cheltenham Secondary College, (1959)
* Cheltenham Primary School, (1855)
* Cheltenham East Primary School, (1956)
* Le Page Primary School, (1994)
* Kingston Heath Primary School, (1976)
* Our Lady of the Assumption Parish Primary School, (1951)

Le Page Primary School was formed as a result of the merger of former primary schools Cheltenham Heights Primary School and Cheltenham North Primary School in 1994.

The Cheltenham Community and Education Centre is located at 8 Chesterville Road, Cheltenham. They offer English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, courses, childcare facilities and workshops.

==Sport==
Cheltenham is home to sporting facilities and clubs. Sports played in the area include soccer, golf, cricket, Australian rules football, lawn bowls, baseball and swimming. There are a number of golf courses in Cheltenham; Cheltenham Golf Club on Victor Avenue which has nine holes however can be played as an eighteen-hole course from different tee boxes, Sandringham Municipal Golf Links on Cheltenham Road, and the Victoria Golf Club on Park Road

The suburb has two Australian Rules football teams. The Rosellas compete in the Southern Football League, as well as the Panthers who compete in the South Metro Junior Football League

Cheltenham Football and Cricket Clubs are based in Weatherall Road. The Cricket Club was established in 1872, originally in the Frankston-Glenhuntly Cricket Association, and migrating to the Federal District Cricket Association where the junior sides still play. The three senior sides now play in Cricket Southern Bayside.

Bentleigh Greens Soccer Club&#x27;s senior team play in the National Premier Leagues Victoria which is the top tier in Victoria. Their home ground is the Kingston Heath Soccer Complex.

==Shopping==
Cheltenham is home to the shopping centre Westfield Southland, located in the northern part of the suburb. When it opened in 1968 it featured a small number of &quot;anchor tenants&quot;, such as Myer and Woolworths, and dozens of smaller retailers, banks and cafes. Since its opening, the shopping centre has been continually expanded and renovated over the years. One such development was the construction of multi-level retail bridge across Nepean Highway linking to a newer three-level extension near the railway line. Southland now features up to 416 stores including 3 department stores, 3 discount department stores, 3 supermarkets, 3 electrical retailers and a 16 screen Village Cinemas Multiplex.

Many new retail outlets have popped up in Cheltenham in recent years, most notably DFO Moorabbin, which is located adjacent to Moorabbin Airport. DFO was originally built in 1992 as Fairways Market, and it is a large shopping centre that contains up to 135 stores, mainly fashion outlets.

Kingston Central Plaza, situated next to DFO, is also a new shopping precinct, which opened in 2008 and has 10 stores including: The Good Guys, Aldi and Sam&#x27;s Warehouse.

Cheltenham Shopping centre is located in the centre of Cheltenham, on Charman Road. It is a large shopping strip that has a mixture of retail, residential buildings and offices.

A farmers market is held on the first Saturday of each month on parkland near the intersection of Nepean Highway and Bay Road.

==Places of worship==
There are a number of religious organisations and places of worship in Cheltenham, including Anglican, Church of Christ, Uniting, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic and Pentecostal/Charismatic Christian churches.

==Cemeteries==
The Cheltenham Pioneers Cemetery is located in Charman Road, next to the railway station, and was established in October 1864. The cemetery has many of Cheltenham&#x27;s most distinguished inhabitants. There are also many memorials to some of Cheltenham&#x27;s youngest inhabitants, such as the many unnamed babies from the nearby Children&#x27;s Home (the site is now occupied by Westfield Southland Shopping centre) who died as a result of disease early in the 20th century.

Most burials now take place at the Cheltenham Memorial Park, located on Reserve Road, which was established in 1933.

==Transport==

The suburb has been serviced by Cheltenham railway station since December 1881, which is located on the Frankston line, alongside Charman Road. In 2017 an additional railway station opened in Cheltenham&#x27;s north; Southland railway station adjacent to the busy shopping centre of the same name, Westfield Southland shopping complex. Bus routes also service the suburb, mainly focusing on the large Westfield Southland Shopping centre complex, Warrigal Road (Highway) to the far east, Park Road to the north and Centre Dandenong Road around the suburb&#x27;s geographic centre.

In 2020 the Victorian government completely rebuilt Cheltenham train station and removed two level crossings in the suburb.

Cheltenham is the starting point for the Suburban Rail Loop. The tunnelling for this underground rapid transit rail line is expected to start in 2026 and the first stage is due to be finished in 2035. The other end of the line terminates at Werribee.

==Library services==
The Cheltenham branch of the City of Kingston Library is located 12 Stanley Avenue, Cheltenham.

==Activity Centres==
Cheltenham is one of 82 higher order Major Activity Centres identified by the Melbourne 2030 growth planning policy. Although the growth planning policy was scrapped by the Victorian coalition government in April 2011, some elements of the policy still remain, including activity centres. Development of Cheltenham&#x27;s Major Activity Centre, which is within 400m of Cheltenham railway station, 
is to be completed by 2030.

Southland is one of 28 Principal Activity Centre&#x27;s located adjacent to the Highett Activity Centre and the Cheltenham Activity Centre. The activity centre&#x27;s main focal point is Westfield Southland shopping complex.

==Politics==
In terms of state and federal government, Cheltenham is situated in the Electoral district of Clarinda, Bentleigh and Sandringham for state parliament and the Electoral district of Goldstein and Isaacs in the federal system.

In the 2018 and 2022 Victorian State elections and the 2019 Australian Federal Election, every booth in Cheltenham reported a two-party majority of votes for the Labor Party.

<doc id="617221" wikidata="Q358257" url="?curid=617221" title="Oskar Backlund">
<text>Johan Oskar Backlund (28 April 1846 – 29 August 1916) was a Swedish-Russian astronomer. His name is sometimes given as Jöns Oskar Backlund, however even contemporary Swedish sources give &quot;Johan&quot;. In Russia, where he spent his entire career, he is known as Oskar Andreevich Baklund (Russian: Оскар Андреевич Баклунд). Russian sources sometimes give his dates of birth and death as 16 April 1846 and 16 August 1916, since Russia still used the Julian calendar at the time.

==Life==
He was born in Länghem, in Västergötland, Sweden and graduated from Uppsala University in 1872. After getting his doctorate in 1875, he emigrated to Russia in 1876. He worked at Dorpat Observatory, in today&#x27;s Tartu, Estonia, and then in 1879 worked at Pulkovo Observatory, becoming director of the observatory from 1895 until his death.

He specialized in celestial mechanics, and notably worked on calculating the orbit of Comet Encke, taking into account the perturbations of various planets. He used observations of Comet Encke to try estimate the mass of Mercury. Russian sources sometimes referred to the comet as Comet Encke-Backlund. He also carried out geodesic studies in Spitzbergen from 1898 to 1900. He became a member of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1883, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1897 and Fellow of the Royal Society in 1911. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1914.

==Family==
He was married to Ulrika Catharina Widebeck. Their daughter Elsa Celsing became a well-known artist, and their son Helge Gotrik Backlund (3 September 1878–1958) was a geologist and explorer.

==Honors==
Awards
*Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1909)
*Bruce Medal (1914)
Named after him
*The crater Backlund on the Moon
*Asteroid 856 Backlunda
*Backlundtoppen, a mountain in Olav V Land at Spitsbergen, Svalbard.

<doc id="617226" wikidata="Q5646144" url="?curid=617226" title="Hampton, Victoria">
<text>Hampton is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Bayside local government area. Hampton recorded a population of 13,518 at the 2021 census.

Hampton is located in Southeast Melbourne, wedged between the suburbs of Brighton and Sandringham. Hampton has a shopping centre along the main road, Hampton Street, with more than 50 cafes and restaurants plus numerous fashion boutiques.

==History==

Hampton, like Brighton, started off as a place of market gardens in the 1840s and 1850s, supplying fruits and vegetables for Melbourne. In the 1850s, interest started to grow in the beaches in the area as places for daytrips and holidays for Melburnians, particularly Picnic Point, on the beautiful bay foreshore of Hampton. This expanded when a railway line was built to Brighton Beach in the 1860s. In 1887, the railway line was extended to Sandringham, with a station servicing Picnic Point. It was called Retreat, after the Retreat Hotel at the Point. However, several landmarks in the area, including the beach, had been named Hampton, after a local market gardener Dyas Hampton, and as wealthy landowners began buying subdivided land in the area, they favored the name Hampton as it sounded more regal. The name was set when the station was renamed Hampton. Hampton Post Office opened on 1 July 1909.

The population continued to grow at the start of the new century, with war commission homes being built for returned WW1 soldiers. Rapid development occurred in the 1930s when the market gardens were subdivided, and today Hampton is part of Melbourne&#x27;s suburban sprawl. In 1957 Hampton North Post Office opened near South Road.

The railway station (which is on the Sandringham Line) remains, although not the original building.

==Sport==

<doc id="617229" wikidata="Q5758468" url="?curid=617229" title="Highett, Victoria">
<text>Highett () is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 16 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Bayside and Kingston local government areas. Highett recorded a population of 12,016 at the .

Located 2 km east of Port Phillip, Highett is bordered by Hampton/Sandringham to the west, Hampton East/Moorabbin to the north and Cheltenham to the east and south.

==History==

The name comes from William Highett, a parliamentarian and local land owner in the 1850s. He purchased Crown land west of Bluff Road, originally part of Dendy&#x27;s Special Survey, in 1853. The area was mainly used for market gardens up until World War II.

The Highett railway station was built when the line from Caulfield to Mordialloc was opened in 1881. Little development happened after the arrival of the railway; the Highett Post Office did not open until 17 November 1924.

The Highett Hall was opened on 11 September 1926 and was used for dances, balls, vaudeville performances and later as a cinema. However it always struggled to find a profitable means to continue operation. It was purchased by the Moorabbin City Council in 1966 and then demolished to make way for the Highett Library, which opened on 1 August 1969.

In 1927 a number of Anglicans banded together to open St Stephens Church of England, in Donald Street, Highett. This was the first church built for the local inhabitants of Highett and by 1937 there was also a Catholic church.

In 1939 the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) constructed a factory in Highett to build aircraft wings and fuselages to support Australia in the Second World War. The factory continued operation until the end of the war in 1945 when the tradesmen were transferred to the main CAC factory in Fishermans Bend and the Bay Road site was closed.

Four large gasometers on land near the intersection of Nepean Highway and Bay Road were a prominent landmark in the area for most of the 20th century.

Highett&#x27;s most substantial residential growth began in the 1950s. Industry was attracted to the area, including a large CSIRO research facility. A primary school was opened in 1953 and a high school in 1956, which Highett High School is now part of Sandringham College. St Agnes&#x27; is the suburbs Catholic primary school.

The strip shopping centre near the railway line expanded, and still remains active. The suburb is undergoing substantial change and rejuvenation with a high number of residential properties being renovated or redeveloped due to the suburb&#x27;s proximity to Melbourne City and Port Phillip Bay which has attracted a large number of younger families and professionals. In 2011 construction of a substantial new shopping centre and apartment complex began on Highett Road, using land once owned by the CSIRO.

===Noteworthy incidents in Highett===
In 1925 a parcel train hit a car at the Wickham Road railway crossing, killing nine people inside the car. The gatekeeper was found not guilty of the charge of manslaughter, the jury finding the incident was due to the fault of the system and not through human negligence.

==Population==

In the 2016 Census, there were 10,454 people in Highett. 66.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.3%, China 2.1%, India 2.1%, New Zealand 1.9% and Greece 1.6%. 73.9% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 3.3%, Mandarin 2.4%, Russian 1.8% and Italian 1.2%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 37.6%, Catholic 23.2% and Anglican 9.2%.

In season 2016/17 the club joined Cricket Southern Bayside. The Highett 1st XI played in Division 2. In all one day matches, Highett players wore the coloured clothing of red white and blue for the first time. Three Highett players have represented Australia in test cricket; Dav Whatmore, Michael Taylor and Simon Davis.

===Bayside Cricket Club===
Prior to the 2017/18 season, the Highett Cricket Club merged with the Moorabbin Park Panthers to form the Bayside Stingrays. The amalgamated club currently has 4 senior teams competing in Cricket Southern Bayside (CSB) and 6 junior teams competing in either South East Cricket Association (SECA) or Inner South East Cricket (ISEC). Games are played at Turner Road Reserve in Highett and Dane Road Reserve in Moorabbin.

The City of Moorabbin built an Olympic-length swimming pool on Turner Road in Highett in 1964. In the 1990s the pool was extensively refurbished and is now called the Waves Leisure Centre.

===Highett Football Club===
The suburb has an Australian rules football team, the Highett Bulldogs, which competes in the Southern Football Netball League (SFNL).

The club house is situated on the Main Oval of Highett Reserve, which is on Turner Road. Its senior teams participate in SFNL Division 1, and the junior sides participate in the South Metro Junior Football League (SMJFL).

<text>The white-browed wagtail or large pied wagtail (Motacilla maderaspatensis) is a medium-sized bird and is the largest member of the wagtail family. They are conspicuously patterned with black above and white below, a prominent white brow, shoulder stripe and outer tail feathers. White-browed wagtails are native to the Indian subcontinent, common near small water bodies and have adapted to urban environments where they often nest on roof tops. The specific name is derived from the Indian city of Madras (now Chennai).

==Taxonomy==
The white-browed wagtail was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the wagtails in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla maderaspatensis&quot;. The specific epithet is Modern Latin for the locality, Madras (or Madraspattanam and now Chennai) in southern India. Gmelin&#x27;s account was based on the &quot;black and white wagtail&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1713 by the English naturalist John Ray. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The white-browed wagtail is the largest species of wagtail at length. It is a slender bird, with the characteristic long, constantly wagging tail of its genus. It has black upperparts, head and breast, with a white supercilium and large white wingbar. Unlike white wagtails it never has white on the forehead. The rest of the underparts are white. The female has the black less intense than in the male. Juveniles are like the females brown-grey where the adult is black.

==Distribution and habitat==

The white-browed wagtail is a resident breeder in India and is endemic to the Indian subcontinent. It is found south of the Himalayas, east of the Indus system and to the west of Bangladesh. It is rare in the higher altitude regions but has been seen in Ladakh on the edge of the Tibetan plateau. In most of India it is found below 1000 m but in southern India it goes up into the hills up to 2200 m. It is very rare in the Indus valley area. It is absent from the Sind region of Pakistan. It is found in open freshwater wetland habitats. It is one of the few &quot;Motacilla&quot; wagtails that has adapted well to urban habitats and is often found perched on overhead water storages in residential buildings.

It is a rare winter visitor to Sri Lanka and have possibly extended their range in recent times.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Stuart Baker in his second edition of &quot;The Fauna of British India&quot; considered this as a subspecies of the white wagtail, calling it &quot;Motacilla lugubris maderaspatensis&quot;. This was however criticized by C B Ticehurst, who noted that it was much larger, never had the white forehead of the white wagtail, was non-migratory and lacked a spring moult. This species is now considered to form a superspecies with Japanese wagtail, Mekong wagtail and the more distant African pied wagtail. Similarities in pre-copulatory behaviour with the Japanese wagtail have been noted. Its song much resembles that of the recently described Mekong wagtail. mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data has not been able to robustly resolve the relationships of these birds, especially in respect to the blue-headed wagtail and its relatives.

The species is considered monotypic and subspecies such as &quot;kangrae&quot; described by Walter Koelz are not recognized.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Usually seen in pairs or small groups near open water. They call often especially in the mornings and are active like most other wagtails. They will perch on the ground as well as on wires or on buildings. The song is long and loud with many different notes. The usual call is a wheezy &quot;wheech&quot;. They can fly fairly rapidly for long distances and they fly with a bounding (dipping and rising) flight pattern and have been recorded to travel at the speed of about 40 km/h.

Endoparasitic filarial parasites of the species &quot;Splendidofilaria singhi&quot; have been recorded in individuals of the species.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is March to October. In southern India, the nesting season begins when river levels drop and continue until the Monsoon rains. In courtship, the male shoots into the air with a single wing beat, sings and glides with dangling legs and puffed feathers. On settling, the tail of the male is raised high and wings held up over the back and the tip is quivered stiffly while he steps around the female. The female responds by crouching and shivering the wings as if begging for food.

It builds its cup-shaped nest placed on the ground or rocks in a hole, ledge or mud bank and is always located close to water. Artificial structures such as bridges and roof tops are also used. Nests have been noticed in a regularly used ferry. The nest is made of grass, roots, algae and other material with a central neat cup lined with hair. Normally four, and three to five eggs is the usual clutch.

===Food===
Like other wagtails, this species is insectivorous. Nestlings were mainly fed orthopterans, caterpillars and spiders. Stayphylinid beetles and pentatomid bugs have also been recorded in their diet. They have adapted to urban environments where water may be found mainly on rooftops as overflow from storage tanks.

==In culture==
In older times in India, the species was sometimes kept as a cage-bird and was acclaimed for its singing ability. The native name of &quot;khanjan&quot; is used in the phrase &quot;khanjan-eyed&quot; to describe someone with beautiful eyes. The Khanjan was held sacred and considered a good omen in India as it supposedly bore an impression of Vishnu&#x27;s shaligram on its breast. A variety of beliefs on the future predicted by where the bird sat and what it did have been documented by Saratchandra Mitra. Another local name for wagtails in India is &quot;dhobin&quot; (or washerwoman).

<text>Marah fabacea (sometimes spelled &quot;Marah fabaceus&quot;), the California manroot or bigroot, is the most common of the manroot species native to California. Its range throughout the state subsumes nearly the entire ranges of all the other California native manroots species and intergrades. Hybrids between California manroot and other species of &quot;Marah&quot; are common.

==Foliage==
Like other manroots, &quot;Marah fabacea&quot; has stout, hairy stems with tendrils. Vines appear in late winter in response to increased rainfall, and can climb or scramble to a length of 6 meters. Its leaves typically have five lobes with individual plants showing wide variation in leaf size and lobe length.

Vines emerge from a large, hard tuberous root which can reach several meters in length and weigh in excess of 100 kilograms. Newly exposed tubers can be seen along roadcuts or eroded slopes and have a scaley, tan-colored surface. Injured or decaying tubers take on a golden or orange color.

==Flower==
The flower can vary in color from yellowish green to cream to white. Flowers appear soon after the vine emerges. The flowers are monoecious, that is, individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant. Male flowers appear in open clusters while females flowers, distinguished by a swollen base, usually appear individually. The plant is self-fertile; pollen from the male flowers can fertilize the female flowers on the same plant. Pollination is by insects.

==Fruit==
The fruit is spherical, 4 to 5 centimeters in diameter, and covered in prickles of variable density, up to 1 centimeter long but without hooks. Unripe fruit are bright green, ripening to yellow. The fruit swells as it ripens until finally rupturing and releasing the large seeds. Fruit begin to form in spring and ripen by early summer. The fruit can induce vomiting and diarrhea.

==Seeds and germination==
Seeds of the California manroot are large, hard, and very smooth. Fruit usually hold 4 or more seeds. Seeds sprout in the cool wetness of late winter. Seeds have an intriguing germination process. The initial shoot emerges from the seed and grows downward into the earth. This shoot then splits, one part beginning to swell and form the tuber, while the second part grows back to the surface and becomes the vine.

==Ecology==
The California manroot grows most vigorously by streams or in washes but is also successful in dry chaparral, at elevations up to 1600 metres. It ranges through most of California except the far northwest and the Mojave Desert. It will tolerate a variety of soil types and acidities, but it requires seasonally moist soil. Vines can grow in full-sun to partially shaded conditions. In mild areas where year-round moisture is available, vines can be perennial. In the Mediterranean climate areas of California, manroot emerges soon after winter rains begin, grows until late spring, and dies back completely in the heat and dryness of summer.

==Taxonomy==
Two varieties have previously been recognized: &quot;Marah fabaceus&quot; var. &quot;agrestis&quot; (found in the San Francisco Bay Area and Contra Costa County), and &quot;Marah fabaceus&quot; var. &quot;fabaceus&quot; (found elsewhere in California). An example occurrence of &quot;M. f. agrestis&quot; is on Ring Mountain in Marin County, California.

==Uses==
The tubers of &quot;Marah fabacea&quot; were crushed and thrown into surface waters by some Native American tribes, including the Kumeyaay and the Coast Miwok, to immobilize fish. The tubers contain megharrhin, a saponin-like glucoside. Saponins lower the surface tension of water allowing the formation of bubbles. It is likely that the substance enters the fish&#x27;s circulation through the gill arches where only a single-cell epithelium separates the water from the animal’s red blood cells. The affected fish float to the surface.

All parts of the plant have a bitter taste (this is the meaning of the genus name &quot;Marah&quot;, which comes from Hebrew). Despite this, the leaves have been used as a vegetable. Due to its saponin content, the large tuber of the manroot can be processed for a soap-like extract. The liquid inside the fruit is an eye irritant, and the spines on the fruit are irritating to the skin.

<text>Yosef Avni (; December 25, 1924 - February 3, 2021) was an Irgun fighter. He was born Yosef Danoch in Jerusalem, British Mandate of Palestine, to Yemenite Jewish immigrants. He changed his name to Avni (his underground identity) after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.

Avni went to work as a locksmith at a young age, to help provide for his family (he learned his job at his cousins&#x27; workshop, the Sabah brothers). At the age of 16 he joined Betar, leaving four years later (in 1942) for the Irgun. After the declaration of the Revolt against the British authorities (February 1944), Avni became part of the fighting force, and on top of being in charge of an arms dump in Jerusalem took part in many operations.

Avni commanded the sappers unit during the second attack on the British intelligence offices in the Russian Compound in Jerusalem on December 27, 1945, in which the building was destroyed and seven British policemen and an Irgun fighter were killed. He also took part in the King David Hotel bombing, being one of the senior commanders of the operation, and the bombing of the British Army base at Camp Schneller, personally lighting the fuses on mines that the raiders had set.

Avni was arrested in 1947 and detained by the British in Latrun Camp. He was released in March 1948, and was wounded attacking the Muchtar&#x27;s house during the events of the Deir Yassin massacre. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, he took part in Operation Kedem.

<doc id="617243" wikidata="Q1446203" url="?curid=617243" title="Dreamtime (The Cult album)">
<text>Dreamtime is the debut studio album by the English rock band the Cult. Released on 31 August 1984 by Beggars Banquet Records, it peaked at No. 21 on the UK Albums Chart and was later certified silver by the BPI after having sold 60,000 copies. The first single, &quot;Spiritwalker&quot;, peaked at No. 1 on the UK Independent Singles Chart. &quot;Dreamtime&quot; has subsequently been reissued (or in some cases bootlegged) in roughly 30 countries worldwide.

Lyrics to the song &quot;Horse Nation&quot; are taken almost verbatim from the non-fiction book &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; (1970). &quot;Spiritwalker&quot; is a reference to shamanism, while &quot;Dreamtime&quot; is inspired by mythology of the Aboriginal Australians and &#x27;Butterflies&#x27; is a reference to the Hopi ceremonial butterfly dance. &quot;A Flower in the Desert&quot; is a reworking of the Southern Death Cult&#x27;s song &quot;Flowers in the Forest&quot;.

The music of the album is characterized as dramatic, moody, dark psychedelic, with &quot;crystalline guitar not that far off from what U2 was going after&quot;. In 1985 Ian Astbury noted that the Cult were &quot;like Big Country and U2, only better!&quot;.

The record was originally being produced by Joe Julian, but after recording the drums, the band decided to replace him, and Beggars Banquet suggested John Brand. The record was ultimately produced by Brand, but guitarist Billy Duffy has said that the drum tracks used on the record were those produced by Julian, as band drummer Nigel Preston had become too unreliable by that time.

==Album information==
The record was largely recorded at Rockfield Studios, near Monmouth, Wales, in late March and early April 1984, mixed at Eel Pie Studios, Twickenham, from 16 to 24 April 1984, and mastered on 27 April 1984.
This record was originally intended to be released on Situation Two, with a catalogue number SITU 57 (or 12). This pressing was to include the original version of &quot;Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)&quot; which uses a psychedelic phasing on the end choruses. Only a small handful of white label test pressings were made of this record before the band decided they didn&#x27;t like that version. They subsequently recorded a new version of the song after signing to Beggars Banquet Records, and that second, more &quot;finalised&quot; version of the song was released. The re-recording of &quot;Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)&quot; was done at Livingston Recording Studios on 22 June 1984. The original test pressing of &quot;Dreamtime&quot; stands as one of the more rare and collectable studio Cult vinyl pressings.

&quot;Bone Bag&quot; (sometimes listed as &quot;Bonebag&quot;) was the original B-side on the &quot;Spiritwalker&quot; single. &quot;Sea and Sky&quot; was the original B-side of &quot;Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)&quot; and &quot;Ressurection Joe&quot; (not spelled in the correct form &quot;Resurrection Joe&quot; but intentionally misspelled) was a new single recorded in November 1984 and released on 14 December 1984. They are included as bonus tracks on the original CD pressings in all countries except the original CD pressing in the Netherlands, where only the 10 original songs are present. The first CD version in the Netherlands also uses different artwork for the back cover. In Germany, the CD version incorrectly lists 13 songs on the back cover, but only includes the 10 original songs as were on vinyl.

== Release ==

&quot;Dreamtime&quot; was released on 31 August 1984 as a double album, accompanied by a nine-song live album titled &quot;Dreamtime Live at the Lyceum&quot;, recorded at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 20 May 1984. There were only 30.000 copies of the live record originally manufactured. It was also released in the UK with different artwork, and on 23 November 1984 also as a picture disc LP.

The record was released in Malaysia for the first time in July 1990, with the second version of the artwork used for the cover. In Czechoslovakia in January 1991, two versions of this record were released by Globus International: one is on black vinyl, and the other is on blue vinyl. The blue vinyl version is apparently quite rare. Both Czechoslovakian pressings use the artwork from the second British pressing. In 2003, the album was remastered and reissued on CD in the Russian Federation, Belarus and Lithuania with the three bonus tracks and different artwork. In October 2004 the record was also remastered and reissued on CD with different artwork in Japan.

<text>Zuhayr bin Abī Sulmā (; ), also romanized as Zuhair or Zoheir, was a pre-Islamic Arabian poet who lived in the 6th &amp; 7th centuries AD. He is considered one of the greatest writers of Arabic poetry in pre-Islamic times. Zuhayr belonged to the Banu Muzaina. His father was a poet and his elder son Ka&#x27;b bin Zuhayr also became a poet, reading his works to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

Zuhayr&#x27;s poems can be found in Hammad Ar-Rawiya&#x27;s anthology, the &quot;Mu&#x27;allaqat&quot; (&quot;the Suspended&quot;), a collection of pre-Islamic poetry. He was one of the seven poets featured in that collection who were reputed to have been honoured by hanging copies of their work in the Kaaba at Mecca. He was Umar ibn al-Khattab&#x27;s favourite poet.

Zuhayr&#x27;s poetry was written when two Arabic tribes ended a longstanding hostility. His poems deal with raids and other subjects of nomadic desert life. He also wrote satirical poems and poems about the glory of his tribe, but in his verses he was less satiric than most of his brother poets. He strove to express deep thoughts in simple words, to be clear and by his clear phrases to teach his people high and noble ideas. He was a man of rank and wealth, the foremost of a family noted for their poetic skill and religious earnestness.

== Cultural reception ==
Zuhayr&#x27;s poetry inspired Saudi land artist Zahrah al Ghamdi&#x27;s 2018 installation &quot;After Illusion&quot; which was shown as part of the Venice Biennale.

<text>The Itelmens (), ) are an Indigenous ethnic group of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. The Itelmen language is distantly related to Chukchi and Koryak, forming the Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family, but it is now virtually extinct, the vast majority of ethnic Itelmens being native speakers of Russian.

Native peoples of Kamchatka (Itelmen, Ainu, Koryaks, and Chuvans), collectively referred to as Kamchadals, had a substantial hunter-gatherer and fishing society with up to fifty thousand natives inhabiting the peninsula before they were decimated during the Russian conquest, both by brutal repressions of the rebellions of locals and by a major smallpox epidemic, in the 18th century. So much intermarriage took place between the natives and the Cossacks that &quot;Kamchadal&quot; now refers to the majority mixed population, while the term &quot;Itelmens&quot; became reserved for persistent speakers of the Itelmen language. By 1993, there were less than 100 elderly speakers of the language left, but some 2,400 people considered themselves ethnic Itelmen in the 1989 census. By 2002, this number had risen to 3,180, and there are attempts at reviving the language. According to the 2010 Russian census, there were 3,193 Itelmens.

Itelmens resided primarily in the valley of the Kamchatka River in the middle of the peninsula. One of the few sources describing the Itelmen prior to assimilation is that of Georg Wilhelm Steller, who accompanied Vitus Bering on his Great Northern Expedition (Second Expedition to Kamchatka).

==Pre-conquest Itelmen society==
===Village structure===

Itelmens tended to settle along the various rivers of the Kamchatka Peninsula. At the time of the arrival of the first Cossacks to the peninsula, in the early 1650s, villages numbered between 200 and 300 residents, a number which had dwindled to 40 or 50 at most by the time of the composition of Steller&#x27;s account in 1744. Each village was centered around a single patriarchal household. Generally, young men seeking marriage joined the village of their wife. When a village became too large to sustain itself, it was divided and a portion of the villagers would create a settlement at another point along the same river. Steller describes a great variation of dialects from river to river, as the Itelmens predominantly communicated with communities which shared the river.

===Itelmen houses===

Itelmens lived in different houses during the summer and winter seasons. The winter house, which was inhabited beginning in November, was dug into the soil in the shape of a rectangle. The walls were then covered with sticks and straw to prevent moisture from penetrating the interior. Four beams at the center of the dwelling supported the roof of the house, upon which rafters were laid, connecting the top of the yurt to the earthen walls. Atop the wooden rafters, approximately of straw was laid, on top of which the excavated dirt was placed and stamped down. An opening atop the yurt, off to one side of the four posts and supported by the two beams, served as a smoke hole and an entrance. Opposite the fireplace, they made a passageway to the outside facing the river, which was left open only when fires were lit. Different sleeping quarters were demarcated by pieces of wood on which straw mats and reindeer or seal skins were used as bedding.

In the summer months, the Itelmens live in raised houses called &quot;pehm&quot; or &quot;pehmy&quot;. As the ground thaws in the summer, the floors of the winter houses began to flood. In the summer months, each family in the village lived in their own house, rather than sharing a large house as in winter. These raised homes, or &quot;balagans&quot; as the Cossacks called them, were pyramids on raised platforms, with a door on the south and the north side. The extreme moisture of the climate required the raising of the homes for dry storage. Most villages, in addition to summer and winter houses, contained straw huts built on the ground, which were used for cooking food, boiling salt from sea water and rendering fat. Villages were surrounded by an earthen wall or palisades until the arrival of the Russians, after which this practice was banned.

===Religion===

The Itelmens subscribed to a polytheistic religion. The creative god was referred to as &quot;Kutka&quot; or &quot;Kutga&quot;. Though he is regarded as the creator of all things, Steller describes a complete lack of veneration for him. The Itelmens attribute the problems and difficulties of life to his stupidity, and are quick to scold or curse him. They believed &quot;Kutka&quot; to be married to an intelligent woman named &quot;Chachy&quot;, who was said to have kept him from much foolishness and to have corrected him constantly. &quot;Kutka&quot; was believed to have lived on the greatest rivers of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and is said to have left a son and daughter for each river, which is used to explain the great variety of dialects present on the peninsula. The Itelmens also worshiped several spirits, &quot;Mitgh&quot;, who dwelled in the ocean and lived in the form of a fish. They believed in forest sprites, who were called &quot;ushakhtchu&quot;, said to resemble people. The mountain gods were called &quot;gamuli&quot; or little souls, who resided in the high mountains, especially volcanoes. The clouds were believed to be inhabited by the god &quot;billukai&quot;, who was responsible for thunder, lightning and storms. They postulated a devil, who was called &quot;Kamma&quot;, who was said to live in a tree outside Nizhnoi village, which was annually shot up with arrows.

===Division of labor===

In general, labor was very clearly divided based on gender, though many tasks were shared. When fishing, the men and women paddled together, however only the men fished while the women performed all related tasks such as cleaning and drying the fish and collecting the eggs. In home construction, men performed all the wood work, digging and carpentry while the women performed the task of thatching the straw roof and cutting the straw with bone sickles made from bear shoulder blades. The women prepare the whole fish supply, except fermented fish and dog food, which is left to the men. The women perform all the tasks of gathering seeds, berries and fireweed, which is used as a type of tea. From grass they construct mats, bags, baskets and boxes for storage and transportation. Dog and reindeer skins are tanned, dyed and sewn into the various garments worn by men and women.

===Food===

The Itelmen seldom observed a set eating time except when entertaining. They also seldom ate as a family unit except when eating &quot;opana&quot; (warm food) or fresh fish. Unlike their indigenous island neighbors, the Evenks and Yakuts, they do not enjoy fried food, eating mostly a diet of cold food. A common staple was fish eggs with willow or birch bark. A common food enjoyed at festivities, &quot;selaga&quot;, was a mash made of sarana, pine nuts, fireweed, cow parsnip, bistort roots, and various berries cooked in seal, whale or fish oil. In Lopatkan, a fermented berry drink was consumed, though there is no indication that any other Itelmen settlements created fermented drinks.

==Cossack conquest==

Steller cites anecdotal evidence of several Russian forays into Kamchatka prior to the arrival of Vladimir Atlasov. Atlasov began his conquest of Kamchatka by sending Luka Morozko on reconnaissance foray in 1695, and embarked himself a year later with 120 men, half of whom were Yukakghir auxiliaries, to gather tribute and to annex the region for the crown. Leaving from Anadyrsk bay on the backs of reindeer, they explored much of the western coast and crossed the mountains to the east to subdue the population there. By mid July 1696, he had reached the Kamchatka River, at which point he divided his party in two, one band returning westward and the other remaining on the eastern coast. At this point the Yukaghir auxiliaries rebelled, killing six Russians and wounding six. A band of Koryaks additionally absconded with Atlasov&#x27;s itinerant reindeer herd, but were chased down by the Russians and killed to one man.

At the head of the Kamchatka River, they first encountered several heavily fortified Itelmen settlements. Here they were initially greeted cordially by the natives, and received tribute without contest. They proceeded to sack a rival Itelmen village upriver, cementing the alliance with the Itelmens. The first Cossack settlement in the area was Bolsheretsk, founded in 1703 by Atlasov, although Steller notes that it was already a prominent village at the arrival of “that wind-bag Atlasov.”

The Itelmens he found there were in possession of a captive Japanese merchant&#x27;s clerk, who had been part of an expedition that was shipwrecked and overtaken by Itelmens upon arrival at the Kamchatka River. Atlasov, who initially assumed the prisoner to be a Hindu from India, resulting in confusion over the word &quot;Hondo&quot; or Tokyo, had him sent to Moscow where Peter the Great had him establish a Japanese-language school.

In 1706, senior governing officials were killed by a band of Koryaks and a period of general lawlessness abounded. The Cossacks began to take great liberties with the legal amount of tribute required and began the practice of taking Itelmens as slaves, often gambling with and trading them. During this time, rebellions were frequent. After serving some time in jail, Atlasov resumed legal control in an effort to reimpose law and order on the peninsula. In 1711 his men mutinied and he fled to Nizhnekamchatsk. There he was given asylum, only to be assassinated in his bed. The mutineers were excused from the death penalty provided they continued government work. Thus an expedition to the southern tip of the peninsula and onto the Kuril Islands was conducted, led by Danila Antsiferov and Ivan Kozyrevsky.

Under his rule, the Itelmens allied with their northern neighbors, the Koryaks, and burned Antsyferov to death on his bed. The rebellions did not quiet down until the 1715 outbreak of smallpox on the peninsula, at which point the Russian Crown had lost five years of tribute and the lives of at least 200 Russians.

Over time, the remaining populations were assimilated. Due to increasingly large suicide rates, the Crown made a law prohibiting natives from taking their own lives. A large mixed population emerged, who were Russian Orthodox in religion, but distinctly Itelmen in looks and customs. The government granted legal status to these mixed children readily, and Itelmen women were legally allowed to marry into the Orthodox Religion. By the arrival of Bering’s second expedition to Kamchatka, the population had shrunk to approximately 10% of what it was prior to the arrival of the Cossacks.

==Subsequent history==
Goods such as guns, tobacco, tea, sugar, and vodka became widely available to Itelmens in the 19th century. Over time, many Itelmens accepted baptism into the Russian Orthodox Church, though animism remained widespread in practice. The Itelmen population was recorded as 4,029 at the 1889 census; by 1959, this had fallen to 1,109, though the population had risen to 2,480 by the 1989 census. Russian-medium schooling became the norm in the 1930s, and as of the 1989 census, fewer than one Itelmen in five could speak the Itelmen language.

<text>Nolinoideae is a monocot subfamily of the family Asparagaceae in the APG III system of 2009. It used to be treated as a separate family, Ruscaceae s.l. The family name is derived from the generic name of the type genus, &quot;Nolina&quot;.

The subfamily includes genera that had been placed in a range of different families, including Ruscaceae s.s., Nolinaceae, Dracaenaceae, Convallariaceae and Eriospermaceae. Like many groups of lilioid monocots, the genera included here were once included in a wide interpretation of the family Liliaceae.

==Genera==
A possibly incomplete list of the genera included in the Nolinoideae is given below. The reference is to the source which places the genus in this subfamily. The genera included here have varied widely in their limits and assignment to families and subfamilies; some former family placements other than Nolinoideae (which will be found in the literature) are given below.

=== Genera formerly placed in Nolinoideae ===
&quot;Calibanus&quot; was a former genus that was placed in the Nolinoideae subfamily when the APG III system was introduced.&quot;&quot; Both members of the genus have since been transferred to the genus &quot;Beaucarnea&quot; (also a member of the Nolinoideae) after molecular phylogenetic research demonstrated a strong phylogenetic relationship with species of &quot;Beaucarnea.&quot;

<text>The Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), also known as the Queensland lungfish, Burnett salmon and barramunda, is the only surviving member of the family Neoceratodontidae. It is one of only six extant lungfish species in the world. Endemic to Australia, the Neoceratodontidae are an ancient family belonging to the class Sarcopterygii, or lobe-finned fishes.

Fossil records of this group date back 380 million years, around the time when the higher vertebrate classes were beginning to evolve. Fossils of lungfish almost identical to this species have been uncovered in northern New South Wales, indicating that &quot;Neoceratodus&quot; has remained virtually unchanged for well over 100 million years, making it a living fossil and one of the oldest living vertebrate genera on the planet.

It is one of six extant representatives of the ancient air-breathing Dipnoi (lungfishes) that flourished during the Devonian period (about 413–365 million years ago) and is the outgroup to all other members of this lineage.
The five other freshwater lungfish species, four in Africa and one in South America, are very different morphologically from &quot;N. forsteri&quot;. The Queensland lungfish can live for several days out of the water, if it is kept moist, but will not survive total water depletion, unlike its African counterparts.

The small settlement of Ceratodus in the Wide Bay–Burnett region of Queensland derives its name from that of the Australian lungfish. The species was named, by Gerard Krefft, in honour of the squatter and politician William Forster.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Australian lungfish is native only to the Mary and Burnett River systems in south-eastern Queensland. It has been successfully distributed to other, more southerly rivers, including the Brisbane, Albert, Stanley, and Coomera Rivers, and the Enoggera Reservoir in the past century. The Australian lungfish has also been introduced to the Pine, Caboolture, and Condamine Rivers, but current survival and breeding success are unknown. Formerly widespread, at one time at least seven species of lungfish were in Australia.

This species lives in slow-flowing rivers and still water (including reservoirs) that have some aquatic vegetation on banks. It occurs over mud, sand, or gravel bottoms. Australian lungfish are commonly found in deep pools of depth and live in small groups under submerged logs, in dense banks of aquatic macrophytes, or in underwater caves formed by soil being washed away under tree roots on river banks. The lungfish is tolerant of cold, but prefers waters with temperatures in the range .

The Australian lungfish cannot survive complete desiccation of its habitat, but it can live out of water for several days if the surface of its skin is constantly moist. Unlike the African species, &quot;Protopterus&quot;, it does not survive dry seasons by secreting a mucous cocoon and burying itself in the mud.

The Australian lungfish is essentially a sedentary species, spending its life within a restricted area. Its home range rarely extends beyond a single pool or, occasionally, two adjacent pools. It does not follow a set migratory path, but may actively seek out suitable spawning habitats between July and December.

==Description==
Australian lungfish are olive-green to dull brown on the back, sides, tail, and fins, and pale yellow to orange on the underside. They have been described as having a reddish colouring on their sides which gets much brighter in the males during the breeding season. This colouration is the only obvious distinguishing sexual characteristic of the lungfish. They have stout elongated bodies and flattened heads with small eyes. The eyes have five types of photoreceptors; four types of cones and a rod. Some of these photoreceptors can reach 20–24 μm in diameter, possibly the largest in the animal kingdom. The mouth is small and in a subterminal position. The lungfish can grow to a length of about , and a weight of . It is commonly found to be about and on average. Both sexes follow similar growth patterns, although the females grow to a slightly larger size. They are covered in slime when taken from the water.

The skeleton of the lungfish is partly bone and partly cartilage. The vertebrae are pure cartilage, while the ribs are hollow tubes filled with a cartilaginous substance. The body of the lungfish is covered with large, bony scales. Ten rows occur on each side, grading to small scales on the fins. The scales are each embedded in their own pockets, and overlap extensively, such that vulnerable areas of the body are covered by a thickness of at least four scales. Two unusually large and thick interlocking scales cover the back of the head where the bony skull is thin. Their cranial muscles (around the skull and jaw) follow similar patterns observed in other vertebrates, whereby the muscles tend to first develop from anterior to posterior, and from their region of origin toward insertion. They have powerful long paddle-shaped diphycercal tails. The pectoral fins are large, fleshy, and flipper-like. The pelvic fins are also fleshy and flipper-like and situated well back on the body. The dorsal fin commences in the middle of the back and is confluent with the caudal and anal fins.

The dentition of the lungfish is unusual: two incisors, restricted to the upper jaw, are flat, slightly bent, and denticulated on the hind margin. These are followed by dental plates on the upper and lower jaws.

Juveniles have different body proportions from mature adults. The head is rounder, the fins are smaller, and the trunk is more slender. Also, the brain is relatively larger and fills more of the cranial cavity in juveniles compared to adults. The mouth is initially terminal, but shifts back as the fish grows. The dorsal fin typically reaches to the back of the head in young juveniles, and gradually moves caudally until it only extends to the mid-dorsal region in adults. They show a gradual change in body form as they develop, but no metamorphosis is externally detectable and no obvious point occurs at which they can be termed adult. As a juvenile, the lungfish is distinctly mottled with a base colour of gold or olive-brown. Patches of intense dark pigment will persist long after the mottling has disappeared. Young lungfish are capable of rapid colour change in response to light, but this ability is gradually lost as the pigment becomes denser.

The lungfish is reputed to be sluggish and inactive, but it is capable of rapid escape movements using its strong tail. It is usually quiet and unresponsive by day, becoming more active in the late afternoon and evening.

==Breathing==
A distinctive characteristic of the Australian lungfish is the presence of a single dorsal lung, used to supplement the oxygen supply through the gills. During times of excessive activity, drought, or high temperatures (when water becomes deoxygenated), or when prevailing conditions inhibit normal functioning of the gills, the lungfish can rise to the surface and swallow air into its lung. More frequent air breathing is correlated with periods of greater activity at night when it uses the lung as a supplementary organ of respiration.

Unlike the South American and African lungfishes, the Australian species has gills on all the first four gill arches, while the fifth arch bears a hemibranch. It is also the only facultative air breather lungfish species, only breathing air when oxygen in the water is not sufficient to meet their needs. The lung is a single long sac situated above and extending the length of the body cavity, and is formed by a ventral outgrowth of the gut. Internally, the lung is divided into two distinct lobes that interconnect along its length, compartmentalized by the infolding of the walls.
Each compartment is further divided to form a spongy alveolar region. Blood capillaries run through this region close enough to the air space in the lung to enable gas exchange. Lungfish breathe in using a buccal force-pump similar to that of amphibians. The contraction of smooth muscles in the walls of the lung results in exhalation.

The sound of the lungfish exhaling air at the surface prior to inhaling a fresh breath has been compared to that made by a small bellows. Young lungfish come to the surface to breathe air when they are about long.

==Reproduction and development==
The Australian lungfish spawns and completes its entire lifecycle in freshwater systems. The age of first breeding is estimated to be 17 years for males and 22 years for females. Males typically become mature at and females at . After an elaborate courtship, the lungfish spawn in pairs, depositing large adhesive eggs amongst aquatic plants. They spawn from August until November, before the spring rains, in flowing streams that are at least a metre deep.

Eggs are most abundant during September and October. The stimulus for spawning is believed to be day length. The lungfish is known to spawn both during the day and at night. The lungfish is selective in its choice of spawning sites. Eggs have been recorded on aquatic plants rooted in gravel and sand, slow- and fast-moving waters, in shade and in full sun, but never on aquatic plants covered with slimy algae, in stagnant water, or where loose debris was on the water&#x27;s surface.

Contrary to its South American and African relatives, the Australian lungfish does not make a nest or guard or care for its eggs. When spawning does take place, the pair of fish will lie on their sides or become entwined. They usually deposit their eggs singly, occasionally in pairs, but very rarely in clusters. The male lungfish fertilizes each egg as it emerges, and the eggs are deposited in dense aquatic vegetation. The newly laid egg is hemispherical, delicate, heavily yolked, and enclosed in a single vitelline and triple jelly envelope. The egg about in diameter; with the jelly envelope, it has a total diameter of about . The egg is sticky for a short while until silt and small aquatic organisms have covered it, but long enough for it to become attached to submerged vegetation. It is negatively buoyant, and if it falls to the lake or river bed, it is unlikely to survive to hatching.

The female has a large ovary and the potential to lay many eggs, but in the wild only produces a few hundreds of eggs, at most, during her lifetime. In captivity, 200 to 600 eggs have been laid in a single event. The lungfish does not necessarily spawn every year. A good spawning season occurs usually once every five years, regardless of environmental conditions.

The eggs and young are similar to those of frogs, but the offspring differ from both frogs and other lungfishes by the absence of external gills during early development. Within the egg, head structures and pigmentation start to appear by day 17. They hatch after three to four weeks, and resemble tadpoles. The young fish are slow-growing, reportedly reaching after 110 days, and about after 8 months. During the first week, it lies on its side, hiding in the weeds, and moving only when stimulated by touch. It will swim spontaneously, and often retreat back into the gelatinous envelope when disturbed. Newly hatched larvae develop a ciliary current over their skin and gill surfaces. This is believed to either provide respiratory exchange across the skin and gills without necessitating any movements of the jaw or brachial apparatus, or to keep the skin of the unprotected larvae free of debris, parasites, and predatory protozoans. Larvae are reported not to feed for two to three weeks while the yolk is still present. By the time the yolk is fully used, a spiral valve has developed in the intestine and the fish starts to feed. The young can grow about per month under optimal conditions.

The Australian lungfish has very complex courtship behaviour made up of three distinct phases. The first is the searching phase, when the fish will range over a large area, possibly searching for potential spawning sites. A pair of fish will perform circling movements at the surface of the water close to beds of aquatic plants. They breathe air more frequently and more noisily than normal, possibly reflecting a greater physiological requirement for oxygen. Individual fish have been observed to breathe air at regular intervals of about 20 minutes, with air breathing accompanied by a distinct loud burp made in the air. The noisy breathing may be a form of a mating call. The lungfish seem to do their noisy breathing in concert, even responding to each other, but never in close vicinity of where the eggs are laid.

The next phase involves behaviour, similar to &quot;follow-the-leader&quot;, during which one fish, the male, shows interest in the female and nudges her with his snout. Up to eight individuals may be involved in follow-the-leader behaviour. The male lungfish may occasionally take a piece of aquatic plant into its mouth and wave it around. In the third phase, the fish dive together through aquatic vegetation, the male following the female and presumably shedding milt over the eggs.

Adults have a high survival rate and are long-lived (at least 20–25 years). An Australian lungfish named &quot;Granddad&quot; at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago was the oldest living fish in any Aquarium, and was already an adult when he was first placed on display in 1933; Granddad was estimated to be at least in his eighties, and possibly over one-hundred, at the time of his death on February 5, 2017. Analysis of Granddad&#x27;s DNA later estimated him to be roughly 109 years old (with an error margin of ±6 years) at the time of his death, and that he was originally captured from the Burnett River in Australia before being transported to the Shedd Aquarium. This discovery also cements the Australian lungfish as the longest-lived subtropical freshwater fish species currently known to science, and one of the 12 longest-living fish species in the world.

The Australian lungfish has an unusually large karyotype, very large chromosomes and cells, and a high nuclear DNA content relative to other vertebrates, but less than what is reported for other lungfishes. In spite of this, it displays low genetic diversity between populations from the Mary, Burnett, and Brisbane catchments. This low level of genetic variation could be attributed to population &quot;bottlenecks&quot; associated with periods of range contraction, probably during the Pleistocene, and in recent times during the periods of episodic or prolonged drought that are known to reduce some reaches of these river systems.

==Diet and feeding habits==
The Australian lungfish is primarily nocturnal, and is essentially carnivorous. In captivity, it will feed on frogs, earthworms, pieces of meat, and pelleted food. In the wild, its prey includes frogs, tadpoles, fishes, a variety of invertebrates, and plant material. No quantitative dietary data are available, but anecdotal observations clearly indicate the diet of the lungfish changes with development. This is proven to be correlated with a change in dentition.

Lungfish larvae are bottom feeders. They eat micro-crustaceans and small &quot;Tubifex&quot; worms, occasionally supplementing their diets with filamentous algae. Soft foods such as worms and plants are partially crushed with a few quick bites and then swallowed. In the adult lungfish, movement of the prey in and out of the mouth is accompanied by strong adduction of the jaws. This crushing mechanism is coupled with hydraulic transport of the food, achieved by movements of the hyoid apparatus, to position the prey within the oral cavity. The Queensland lungfish exhibits the most primitive version of these biomechanical feeding adaptations and behaviors.

==Conservation status==
Although the status of the Australian lungfish is secure, it is a protected species under the Queensland &quot;Fish and Oyster Act of 1914&quot; and capture in the wild is strictly prohibited. It was placed on the CITES list in 1977. The lungfish is currently protected from fishing, and collection for education or research purposes requires a permit in Queensland, under the &quot;Fisheries Act of 1994&quot;, and from the Commonwealth Government. It was included on the list of &quot;vulnerable&quot; species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, as studies have failed to show it meets the criteria needed to be considered a threatened or endangered species. However, the species has been classified as Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as of 2019.

Human activities currently threaten the Australian lungfish, particularly water development. It is potentially at risk in much of its core distribution in the Burnett and Mary Rivers, as 26% of these river systems are presently impounded by weirs and dams. Barriers to movement and altered flow regimens downstream of dams for irrigation purposes could lead to the disruption of existing population structure and cause even more loss of genetic variation. Researcher Anne Kemp has documented the decline of lungfish in many reservoirs and river systems due to lack of recruitment caused by dams.

Australian lungfish can be very fast-growing, yet with a delayed first breeding age. For a long-lived species with naturally low mortality rates, successful spawning and juvenile recruitment is not essential every year and may only occur irregularly in medium to long cycles, even in natural environments. The length of these cycles could easily mask the potentially deleterious impacts on recruitment for many years. Additionally, large adults could remain common for decades and give no indication of a declining population in the longer term.

The Mozambique mouthbrooder, or tilapia, has been declared a noxious and threatening alien species to the lungfish in Queensland.

==Recent events==
Proposed 2006 damming projects on both the Mary and Burnett rivers threatened the habitat of the remaining lungfish. The dams would have changed the flow of the rivers, eliminating the slow, shallow areas the fish need for spawning. Scientists worldwide became involved in saving the habitat for these lungfish, citing their evolutionary importance.
As of January 2022, the world&#x27;s oldest living aquarium fish is a 90-year-old named Methuselah. At 4 feet long and 40 pounds, the lungfish resides at the California Academy of Sciences&#x27; Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco. Methuselah inherited the title from Granddad. Granddad, another Australian lungfish, died at the age of 109 at Chicago&#x27;s Shedd Aquarium in 2017.

==Relationship with humans==
In a 2021 FlyLife article, Karl Brandt proposed the Australian lungfish as the inspiration for Gurangatch, the legendary reptile fish from Gandangara mythology.

<doc id="617262" wikidata="Q1205910" url="?curid=617262" title="Yokohama, Aomori">
<text>is a town located in Aomori Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 4,258 in 2134 households, and a population density of 33 persons per km2, in 1,779 households. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Yokohama occupies the northeastern coastline of Mutsu Bay, at the entrance to Shimokita Peninsula.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
Aomori Prefecture
*Mutsu
*Higashidōri
*Noheji
*Rokkasho

===Climate===
The town has a cold maritime climate characterized by cool short summers and long cold winters with heavy snowfall (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Yokohama is 9.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1262 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 21.9 °C, and lowest in January, at around -2.6 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Yokohama has declined over the past 60 years.

==History==
Finds of Jōmon pottery indicate that the area of Yokohama was inhabited for many thousands of years. The place name of &quot;Yokohama&quot; predates its more famous namesake in Kanagawa Prefecture, and can be found in Nanboku-chō period documents. The area around Yokohama was controlled by the Nambu clan from the Kamakura period and was the site of several small fortifications in the Sengoku period. In the Edo Period, it was part of Morioka Domain and prospered through trade with the Kansai region, exporting particularly hinoki cypress and sea cucumber in exchange for cloth. However, much of the timber had been logged out by the mid-18th century. Yokohama was also a post town on the Tanabe &quot;kaidō&quot;, a highway to the north shore of the Shimokita Peninsula from where travelers could take a boat to Ezo (Hokkaido). Following the Boshin War, it was part of the territory of the briefly-established Tonami Domain, where ex-samurai from former Aizu Domain were resettled. During the post-Meiji restoration establishment of the modern municipalities system on 1 April 1889, Yokohama was proclaimed to be a village. In 1891, the Tohoku Main Line was opened, and passengers heading to Ezo could travel via Aomori on the line, and the importance of towns along the Tanabe &quot;kaidō&quot;, including Yokohama, declined sharply. Yokohama was elevated to town status on April 1, 1958.

==Government==
Yokohama has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of ten members. Yokohama is part of Shimokita District which, together with the city of Mutsu, contributes three members to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Aomori 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Yokohama was traditionally heavily dependent on commercial fishing in Mutsu Bay, primarily for sea cucumber, the local specialty, as well as sea urchin roe and scallops. With regards to agriculture, rapeseed and potato farming predominates. Electrical power production via wind farms also contributes to the local economy.

==Education==
Yokohama has one public elementary school and one public middle school operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
 East Japan Railway Company (JR East) - Ōminato Line

===Highway===
* Shimokita Expressway

<doc id="617263" wikidata="Q10859027" url="?curid=617263" title="Burin (lithic flake)">
<text>In archaeology and the field of lithic reduction, a burin (from the French &quot;burin&quot;, meaning &quot;cold chisel&quot; or modern engraving burin) is a type of stone tool, a handheld lithic flake with a chisel-like edge which prehistoric humans used for carving or finishing wood or bone tools or weapons, and sometimes for engraving images.

In archaeology, burin use is often associated with &quot;burin spalls&quot;, which are a form of debitage created when toolmakers strike a small flake obliquely from the edge of the burin flake in order to form the graving edge.

== Documented use ==

Standardized burin usage is typical of the Middle Paleolithic and Upper Palaeolithic cultures in Europe, but archaeologists have also identified them in North American cultural assemblages, and in his book &quot;Early Man in China&quot;, Jia Lanpo of Beijing University lists dihedral burins and burins for truncation among artifacts uncovered along the banks of the Liyigon river near Xujiayao.

Burins can also be associated with compound microblade projectile technology, found with microblade cores and/or microblades. In these cases, their purpose is interpreted as both a rapid retouch and hafting preparation strategy for blade-based edge tools and bifaces and as a class of dedicated flake or blade-based tools used to insert microblades and other microliths into organic armatures. 

==Types==
Multiple types of burin exist.

A type of burin diagnostic of the archaeological stratum where they are found is the &quot;&quot;Noailles&quot; burin&quot;, named for its original find-site, the &quot;Grotte de Noailles&quot;, in the commune of Brive-la-Gaillarde, Corrèze, in southwestern France. It consists of a small multiple burin characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic cultural stage called the Gravettian, ca. 28–23,000 BC; these flake tools have been restruck and refined to give several chisellike edges and a blunt, grippable rear edge.

Another type of burin is called the &quot;ordinary burin&quot;, which occurs when a burin facet is backed against another burin facet.

A &quot;bec-de-flute&quot; burin, or &quot;axial burin&quot; began as a long flake, but one of both ends have been knocked off, giving two working facets meeting at an angle.

Neighbouring suburbs include Bentleigh East, Brighton East, Moorabbin and McKinnon.

==History==
===Etymology===

Formerly known as East Brighton, the area was renamed Bentleigh in 1908 after Victorian Premier, Sir Thomas Bent This brought the suburb name in line with the name of the local railway station.

===19th Century===
The first Post Office in the area opened on 1 July 1865 as Jasper Road. After the railway arrived it moved to near the station in 1882 and was named Brighton East.

===20th Century===
A Patterson Post Office opened in 1948. In 1961 it was renamed Patterson West when a new Patterson office opened near the railway station.

===21st Century===
Bentleigh is home to Alnutt Park, Victory Park, Halley Park, and Bentleigh Memorial Gardens. The strip shopping centre along Centre Road is the biggest in the area, of over 250 retail businesses, and convenient car parking. The shopping centre has a focus on fresh food, continental delis and cake shops, restaurants and cafes. It has bank branches, fashion and shoe shops, doctors surgeries, dentists and other medical services, an independent bookshop, a newsagent, a toy shop and three supermarkets. It has other services like hairdressers, picture framers, op shops for second-hand retail, and an interior decorator. There is a weekly market next to the train station.

There is also Patterson road shopping centre that has a café, two coffee shops, a Chinese restaurant, an Indian restaurant, a newsagent, a supermarket, a bakery, an organic green grocer, a fishmonger, a travel agent, a pizza shop, a nail technician, a violin maker, a remedial massage centre and three hairdressers.

This was after several fatal accidents at the crossing involving pedestrians.

In 2016, the level crossing was upgraded once again as part of the &#x27;Level Crossing Removal Project&#x27; initiative. Boom gates no longer occupy the road crossing, as the tracks have been modified to pass underneath. The station has been upgraded to a more modern look.

Bentleigh is also serviced by two bus services. The 703 is a SmartBus service which runs from Middle Brighton to Blackburn through Bentleigh&#x27;s main shopping strip Centre Road. The 701 service starts from Bentleigh railway station and terminates at Oakleigh railway station.

<text>Caulfield is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Glen Eira local government area. Caulfield recorded a population of 5,748 at the 2021 census.

It is bounded by Kooyong Road in the west, Glen Eira Road in the north, Glen Huntly Road in the south and Booran Road in the east.

Caulfield is best known as the location of Caulfield Racecourse and the Caulfield campus of Monash University.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The origin of the name of Caulfield is not known for certain, but the name seemed to be linked with Baron Caulfield of Ireland, perhaps through John Caulfield, a pioneer of the colony. The name Caulfield was in use by 1853, and the early maps always place it somewhere around the racecourse.

===Pre-European history===
The local Yalukit people were coastal and dependent on seafoods, so few Aboriginal relics have been found in Caulfield. Nevertheless, some contact did occur in the area between Aborigines and British settlers. Murrum Murrumbean was a local native from whom the placename Murrumbeena derives. Frederick Chapman (later Justice of the New Zealand Supreme Court) was able to recollect a corroboree which took place in Hotham Street, involving hundreds of Gippsland Aborigines.

===Establishment===
In the mid nineteenth century, the Caulfield area was swampy, low-lying ground. It served as watering and pasture land for the pastoralists driving stock from Gippsland to Melbourne. In the 1840s, several distinct communities had arisen throughout the area. Owensville was located around the western end of Glen Eira Road. Alma Road Village was another middle class area further north. Camden Town was a working class area at the junction of Glen Huntly and Hawthorn Roads. Meanwhile, the area south of Paddy&#x27;s Swamp (now Caulfield Park) developed into the main commercial area of Caulfield. Initially the Black Chapel at that point served as the area&#x27;s first church. This building was soon converted to Boxill&#x27;s general store. The whole area was proclaimed the Caulfield Road District in 1857. It served as a location for several grand mansions for wealthy Melbourne citizens over the following decades. Caulfield Post Office opened on 1 January 1863 and closed in 1974. Caulfield Junction Post Office opened in 1923 and remains open.

==Population==

At the 2016 census, Caulfield had a population of 5,595. 53.0% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were South Africa 5.4%, China 3.3%, Israel 3.0%, Poland 2.8% and England 2.3%. 63.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Russian 6.0%, Hebrew 4.1%, Greek 3.8% and Mandarin 3.4%. The most common responses for religion in Caulfield were Judaism 40.5%, No Religion 21.6% and Catholic 10.5%.

==Parks and open space==

Caulfield Park, which is nearby in Caulfield North, is a large (approximately 26 hectare) Victorian garden flanked by Hawthorn, Balaclava and Inkerman Roads and Park Crescent, which features a war memorial, a decorative lake and playing fields for various sports.

<doc id="617270" wikidata="Q266107" url="?curid=617270" title="Forest wagtail">
<text>The forest wagtail (Dendronanthus indicus) is a medium-sized passerine bird in the wagtail family Motacillidae. It has a distinctive plumage that sets it apart from other wagtails and has the habit of wagging its tail sideways unlike the usual up and down movements of the other wagtail species. It is the only wagtail species that nests in trees. It is found mainly in forested habitats, breeding in the temperate parts of east Asia and wintering across tropical Asia from India to Indonesia.

==Taxonomy==
The forest wagtail was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the wagtails in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla indica&quot;. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;indicus&quot; meaning &quot;Indian&quot;. Gmelin based his account on &quot;La Bergeronnette gris des Indes&quot; that had been described in 1782 by the French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat. The forest wagtail is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Dendronanthus&quot; that was introduced in 1844 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth. The name &quot;Dendronanthus&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;dendron&quot; meaning &quot;tree&quot; with the genus &quot;Anthus&quot; that was introduced for the pipits by Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1805. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
This is a distinctive wagtail, the only one placed in the genus &quot;Dendronanthus&quot; (all other wagtails are placed in &quot;Motacilla&quot;). The forest wagtail is in length, a slender bird with a long tail. The back and crown are olive brown, and the wings are black with two yellow wing bars and white tertial edges. There is a white supercilium, above a dark stripe through the eye. The underparts are white, apart from a black double breast band. The upper breast band is bib-like while the lower band is often broken. The sexes are similar in appearance. Young birds are more yellowish on the underside.
The forest wagtail has a single-note call (&quot;&#x27;pink pink&quot;&#x27;) given often while on the ground or even in high flight. In addition, the birds have a soft lilting song. The brown shrike (&quot;Lanius cristatus confusus&quot;) sometimes imitates the calls of the forest wagtail.

==Distribution and habitat==
As its English and scientific names imply, this is a forest species, a distinction from all other wagtails. It is usually found in open areas of the woodland such as clearings. In winter it is found mainly in well-shaded forest habitats or along paths in coffee plantations and clearings in forests.

The breeding areas are in eastern Asia, parts of Korea, parts of China (Gansu, Anhui, Hunan) and parts of Siberia. Southern records of breeding from Assam have been questioned. It migrates to the warmer parts of Asia in winter and it has been suggested that they reach southern India and Sri Lanka via the Andaman Islands. It has been recorded as a vagrant in the Maldives and Australia.

It was formerly thought to winter only in southwestern India, passing through the rest of the peninsula on migration. But now it has been shown to winter in all of the southern part of the peninsula in addition to southwestern India.

==Behaviour and ecology==
These wagtails are found singly or in small groups. They often forage in the trees and capture insects along the branches of trees. They may also forage on the ground like a pipit and when disturbed, it flies up into the trees with a sharp &quot;pink&quot; note. They can climb steep branches and will run rapidly along horizontal branches. They roost in the company of other wagtails among reeds.

==Breeding==
The breeding season is May in northeastern India and June in the Amur region. The forest wagtail leaves the winter quarters towards the end of March from Sri Lanka and mid March from the Malay Peninsula, the last birds leaving around May. During particularly cold springs, the arrival in the summer breeding grounds near the Kedrovaya River (Ussuri Land) can be as late as the end of May. Males sing from May to July, and when calling the bird sways at each syllable. It is the only wagtail that builds nests on trees, often favouring oaks. It builds its cup-shaped nest made up of fine grass and rootlets matted with moss and cobwebs. The nest is built by the female alone and the male stands guard nearby. The usual clutch is five eggs, incubated by the female alone for about 13 to 15 days. Incubation begins before the full clutch is laid and the eggs hatch at intervals. The young fledge and leave the nest after about 10 to 12 days. Both the male and female take part in feeding the young. Like other wagtails, this species is insectivorous.

Apart from its unusual plumage pattern and habitat, the forest wagtail differs from its &quot;Motacilla&quot; relatives in its strange habit of swaying its tail from side to side, not wagging it up and down like other wagtails. The Japanese name &quot;Jokofury-sekirei&quot; (=sideways-swinging wagtail) ) is based on this habit. In Sri Lanka, they often search for maggots in cattle dung and for this reason are known as &quot;gomarita&quot; (=dung-spreader).

<text>Carnegie is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 12 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, on the railway line between Caulfield and Oakleigh, located within the City of Glen Eira local government area. Carnegie recorded a population of 17,909 at the 2021 census.

The suburb&#x27;s main shopping precinct is a well-regarded &#x27;eat street,’ with cafes and restaurants lining Koornang Road from Dandenong Road to Neerim Road. Koornang Park and the neighbouring Carnegie Swim Centre are located between Koornang Road, Munro Avenue and Lyons Street.

Originally called Rosstown, after William Murray Ross, a prominent property developer and entrepreneur, a name change came about due to Ross&#x27; failed speculative developments.
In 1909 it was renamed Carnegie. It has been suggested that this was done in an unsuccessful attempt to secure funds for a library from the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie but there is no contemporary evidence supporting this.

Its postcode is 3163.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The area was originally called Rosstown, after the developer William Murray Ross, who owned a large amount of land in the area. The original name lives on in the name of the local hotel, and in Rosstown Road. Leila Road is named after Ross&#x27;s wife, and Grange Road is named after Ross&#x27;s estate, &quot;The Grange&quot;, which has since been subdivided into suburban housing estates.

===Establishment===
In 1875 Ross began circulating a broadsheet proposal which detailed the &quot;Rosstown project&quot;, a large scale sugar beet processing mill, a railway line to serve it, and a residential estate, named after him on the edge of the metropolis between Melbourne and the town of Oakleigh. Although he began building the mill, it never began production, and the Rosstown Railway he constructed was never used.

However the estate sold well and gradually Rosstown had grown to a reasonable size aided by the opening of the railway to Melbourne in 1879.

Carnegie Post Office opened on 1 September 1911. Carnegie was originally part of the City of Caulfield and by the 1920s it had a substantial commercial area.

The Carnegie Theatre was a popular cinema in the 1930s.

Carnegie Library and Community Centre sits between Koornang Road and Shepparson St, with a nearby Community space developed in 2021.

==Transport==

The northern part of Carnegie and the Koornang Road shopping strip is served by Carnegie station on the Cranbourne/Pakenham line. Carnegie is served by CDC Melbourne bus routes 623, 624, 626, 900 and NightBus 980. Tram route 67 terminates just south of the shopping centre and serves the southern part of Carnegie. The Public Transport Users Association has instigated calls for its extension to the nearby Carnegie station which services the shopping centre, as a major mode interchange .

===Buses===
* SmartBus service
* NightBus services

===Trains===
There are two train services that pass through Carnegie railway station. As part of the government&#x27;s Level Crossing Removal Project, Carnegie station closed in January 2017 and was demolished with a replacement opening in November 2017.

==Demographics==

Carnegie has a diverse cultural cross-section, with many permanent settlers from across the globe, and transient international students studying at the nearby Monash University (Caulfield campus).

==Commercial centres==
===Koornang Road===
On Koornang Road alone there are restaurants and grocers offering Malaysian, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Indian, Italian, Greek, Polish, French, Vietnamese, Uighur and Russian foods, as well as the Rosstown Hotel.

===Princes Highway===
Dandenong road is increasingly becoming a focus of Carnegie&#x27;s development. Originally the Rosstown Hotel was the focus of this part of the commercial strip, however today there are numerous showrooms and homemaker stores.

==Schools==

The main primary school is Carnegie Primary School (No. 2897), established in 1888 as Rosstown State School.

==Parks and recreation==

Surrounded by native bushland, Packer Park has a broad range of sport and recreation facilities including a velodrome (cycling), football oval, tennis and basketball practice areas, lawn bowls/bocce greens, extensive adventure playground, BBQs, wetland walking trail and off-leash dog-walking areas.

The Velodrome, located at Packer Park, is one of the few of its kind in Victoria and is home to Carnegie Caulfield Cycling Club. Athletes used the velodrome as a cycling training venue during the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, while Australian athletes trained here for the 1960 and 1964 Olympic Games.

The 17 km-long Djerring Trail, which runs under the elevated rail pylons, was completed in 2018. The leafy, shared pedestrian/bike path has exercise stations, and links Carnegie to Murrumbeena (east) and Caulfield (west). Table tennis tables (bring your own bats and balls) and exercise equipment are adjacent to the trail opposite the train station on the west side of Koornang Road.

The Carnegie War Memorial features a rose garden and cypress trees on Koornang Road, midway between Neerim Road and North Road. This is also the playground side of Koornang Park, which also provides grassed areas, walking trails, golf cages and cricket nets, and is home to Caulfield Football Club and Caulfield Junior Football Club. Carnegie Memorial Swimming Pool is a beloved outdoor 50s-style complex with grassed areas undergoing redevelopment. The new complex will provide for indoor and outdoor aquatic sport and recreation.

Lord Reserve continues on from Koornang Park and the pool, providing three sports ovals (cricket and soccer), cricket nets, a picnic shelter and BBQs, off-leash dog area and a perimeter walking path. It is home to Carnegie Cricket Club, Carnegie South Cricket Club, Monash Gryphons Cricket Club, Glen Eira Football (soccer) Club, Caulfield Cougars Soccer Club and Glen Eira Junior Soccer Club.

==Notable people==
* Australian artist Lisa Roet is world renowned for her giant chimpanzee and golden monkey sculptures which scale buildings, and simian inspired jewellery. 
* Former Hawthorn Australian Football League player, Len Andrews (1922–2010), originally played for Carnegie.

<text>Elsternwick is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 9 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Glen Eira local government area. Elsternwick recorded a population of 10,887 at the 2021 census.

==Administrative division==

In terms of its cadastral division, Elsternwick is in the parish of Prahran within the County of Bourke.

==Location==

Elsternwick is bounded by the Nepean Highway, Elster Avenue, Kooyong Road, Glen Eira Road, and Hotham Street (the continuation of Williams Road).

Formerly Elsternwick covered the area located in the City of Bayside bounded by Head/Bridge Street, Nepean Highway, Glen Huntly Road and St. Kilda Street. This includes the cricket ground (originally the home of the Elsternwick Cricket Club) and currently known as the Sportscover Arena. It is located within the larger area known as Elsternwick Park – located at the junction of the Nepean Highway and Glen Huntly Road – as is the former Elsternwick Park Golf Course.

==Name==

In the same way that Ripponlea took its name from the Rippon Lea Estate of Sir Frederick Sargood, Elsternwick took its name from the largest property in the district: Charles Ebden&#x27;s house &quot;Elster&quot; (&quot;Elster&quot; is German for &quot;&quot;). The area was previously known as Red Bluff.

The creek nearby became known as the Elster Creek; and, when a village grew up on the creek, the Anglo-Saxon suffix &#x27;wick&#x27;, meaning village, was added.

==History==

The Elsternwick village was proposed in 1851 . Elsternwick was originally situated across three municipalities - Caulfield, Brighton and St Kilda. At the end of the 1880s unsuccessful attempts were made for Elsternwick to become administratively independent. Today it is in the Local Government Area of the City of Glen Eira. The postcode is 3185.

Elsternwick village was surveyed in 1856, and Elsternwick Post Office opened on 22 June 1860.

In 1861 a railway line, operated by the Melbourne &amp; Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company, was built from Melbourne to Brighton which included a railway station at Elsternwick. The first site of Caulfield Grammar School, founded in 1881, was adjacent to the Elsternwick railway station.

In the 1880s, Elsternwick railway station was also the Melbourne end of the railway line to the large-scale sugar beet processing mill at Rosstown (see Rosstown Railway) – now known as Carnegie – and beyond. This railway was seldom used, and it ceased to function in 1916.

A tramline was opened along Glen Huntly Road in 1889. Another tramline, running between Elsternwick and Point Ormond, was opened on 4 June 1915, and was closed on 22 October 1960.

The ABC studios in Melbourne were located in Gordon Street. The studios were built during the 1950s and 1960s and were decommissioned in 2017. Many programs were filmed and produced in the studios, such as Countdown, Recovery and Adam Hills in Gordon Street Tonight.

==Today==

Glen Huntly Road in Elsternwick has a variety of cafés and restaurants. Elsternwick was the home of perhaps the best-known brothel in Australia, and certainly Melbourne; Daily Planet, which was the first in the world to be listed on a stock exchange (the Australian Securities Exchange).

Hattam (Mens and Boys Wear) Stores, at 383 Glenhuntly Road, a long, narrow shop, is one of the last locations in Australia that still has a Lamson &quot;Rapid Wire&quot; Cash Carrier in place; it connects three locations in the lower section of the shop with the central cashier&#x27;s desk.

The 2017 season of &quot;The Block&quot; was filmed in Regent Street.

==Population==

In the 2016 Census, there were 10,349 people in Elsternwick. 65.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.9%, New Zealand 1.9%, India 1.7%, South Africa 1.7% and China 1.5%. 73.0% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 2.6%, Hebrew 2.0%, Russian 1.9%, Yiddish 1.8% and Mandarin 1.7%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 35.5%, Catholic 18.0%, and Judaism 17.8%.

==Transport==

Elsternwick railway station on the Sandringham railway line is located on Riddell Parade next to Glen Huntly Road. For a number of years (in the late 1800s and early 1900s) it was also where the Rosstown Railway linked up with the Sandringham railway line.

Melbourne tram route 67 links Elsternwick to the Melbourne city centre. It travels along Glen Huntly Road from Carnegie, through Glen Huntly and Caulfield South to Elsternwick and, then, via Brighton Road and St Kilda Road to the CBD, via Swanston Street. It terminates at the University of Melbourne.

==Sport==
The Elsternwick Club Sandham St est 1919 includes Lawn Bowls on Tiff Dwarf green and various function rooms.

The Elsternwick Cricket Club was founded in August 1901. The Elsternwick Main Oval, now known as Sportscover Arena or Elsternwick Park, was established shortly after the club&#x27;s foundation. The &#x27;Wickas&#x27;, as the club is affectionately known, plays in the Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association.

Golfers played at Elsternwick Park Golf Club, also known as Royal Elsternwick, on Glen Huntly Road until 2018, when the course closed to be used as passive open space.

The Elsternwick Croquet Club, founded in 1911, is situated in the Hopetoun Gardens.

==Schools==
===State Schools===
The Elsternwick Primary School – once officially located in &quot;Brickwood Street, Elsternwick&quot; – is now, without any shift in its physical position, officially located in Murphy Street, Brighton (); and, consequently, the suburb currently has no government schools.

===Private Schools===
* Wesley College - Elsternwick Campus (formerly: Methodist Ladies&#x27; College and Cato College)
* Leibler Yavneh College
* St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School

<doc id="617278" wikidata="Q5567817" url="?curid=617278" title="Glen Huntly, Victoria">
<text>Glen Huntly is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 11 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Glen Eira local government area. Glen Huntly recorded a population of 4,905 at the 2021 census.

It is a small suburb, approximately 1 km from north to south and 800 metres east to west at its widest point. Its borders are Neerim Road in the north, Booran Road in the west, Grange Road in the east and Woodville Avenue and Oakleigh Road in the south.

==History==

Glen Huntly is named after a ship, the &quot;Glen Huntly&quot;, that arrived in Port Phillip in April 1840, after setting off from Greenock, Scotland carrying 157 new immigrants, skilled manual labourers who were heading for the new colony settled in Melbourne. Fever, most likely typhoid, struck the ship mid journey and 10 died before reaching Port Phillip Bay. The &quot;Glen Huntly&quot; was forced to land at Little Red Bluff (now Point Ormond) where Victoria&#x27;s first quarantine station, consisting of tents, was set up to deal with the crisis. Three more men died at the camp. Supplies and provisions were brought down a dirt track that became Glen Huntly Road.

===Suburb name===
The official name of the suburb is Glen Huntly, as shown in the Victorian Register of Geographic Names. Since its foundation, the suburb has been known at various times as Glen Huntly (two words) and Glenhuntly (one word) and this still causes confusion; a glance at various local businesses names reveals both versions being used. Glen Huntly railway station opened on 19 December 1881 as Glen Huntly Road. The station was renamed Glen Huntly on 1 September 1882, and then Glenhuntly on 20 April 1937. When the station was temporarily closed in April 2023 to remove the level crossing it was announced that the new station would revert to Glen Huntly. The Glen Huntly Post Office opened in 1907 as Glenhuntly Post Office before the name was changed to the current name in 1993.

==Public transport==

The suburb is serviced by tram route 67 and Glen Huntly railway station on the Frankston railway line.

==Demographics==

The 2016 census showed that the median age of people in Glen Huntly was 32 years. Children 0 – 14 years made up 13.4% of the population and those aged 65 years and over made up 10.6% of the population.

38.2% of people living in Glen Huntly were born in Australia and then the next most common countries of birth were India 20.0%, China 9.3%, South Africa 2.3%, England 2.0% and Ukraine 1.4.

The census listed the main religions in Glen Huntly as Hinduism 18.4%, Catholic 13.5% and Judaism 10.2%. &#x27;No Religion&#x27; accounted for 34.1% and 8.8% did not answer this non-compulsory census question.

==Educational institutions==

Glen Huntly has a state primary school and a Catholic primary school and church (St Anthony&#x27;s) .

<text>McKinnon is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 12 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Glen Eira local government area. McKinnon recorded a population of 6,878 at the 2021 census.

This was highlighted by the loss of a butcher, green grocer, independent supermarket, nursery, bank, library and doctor&#x27;s surgery. However, in recent years the shopping strip has begun to reinvent itself with the emergence of a small but noticeable cafe culture.

The Post Office opened on 9 March 1915 as Manchester Road, and was renamed Bentleigh North in 1949 and McKinnon in 1964.

McKinnon is also home to a World War II memorial located at 119 McKinnon Rd. The memorial gives the names of soldiers from the area who were killed in the war.

==Toponymy==

The name &quot;Murrumbeena&quot; derives from the Aboriginal word &quot;mirambena.&quot; It may have meant &quot;land of frogs&quot;, &quot;moss growing on decayed wood&quot; or it may be a derivative from the name of an Aboriginal elder.

The oldest building (430 Neerim Road) is a double storey Victorian era building dating from 1889. The village contains modern cafes and dining options (modern Australian, Chinese, fish and chips, Indian, pizza, Thai, Vietnamese); a wine bar; businesses including hairdressers/barbers, florist and curio/op shops; and services including a bank, post office, newsagent and pharmacy. Yoga and dance studios, and a martial arts centre also feature in this area.

Artist Merric Boyd would buy his sketchbooks (Octavo Spirax #577) at the newsagency here.

Murrumbeena Village is currently undergoing a creative revival following major infrastructure upgrades during 2017–2019. Numerous unique street cafes, evening dining options and a wine bar have popped up alongside small businesses in creative fields which value the suburb&#x27;s combined ease of access, walkability and village feel.

==Architecture and design==

Murrumbeena Village (c1880s) is heritage protected due to its brick and rendered building facades. This rejuvenating suburb, has seen a significant increase in urban density along the rail corridor and main arterials with single-level dwellings replaced by four to five-storey buildings. Outside of the main streets, Murrumbeena is a mix of predominantly single-family detached homes with small pockets of walk-up flats of up to two stories developed since the 1960s. The predominant style of the buildings in the shopping strip, station and surrounding homes are Federation and Interwar which include many magnificent examples of single story Art Deco designs.

The Victoria Heritage Database lists the following significant buildings in Murrumbeena:
* Murrumbeena Primary School in Hobart Road
* &quot;Alnwick,&quot; 11 Railway Parade, is an early example of Queen Anne style and was built for Sir James Patterson, former Commissioner of Public Works, and Railways and Premier and Chief Secretary at the time
* ”Tralee&quot;, 4 Wahroonga Crescent, was built by painter Arthur Merric Boyd and Emma Minnie Boyd, and is a unique blend of California Bungalow and Victorian styles with ornate features
* &quot;Urangara,&quot; 21 Omama Road
* &quot;Croft Head&quot; (built in 1887) at 13 Poath Rd - historically and aesthetically significant
* The Beauville Estate (built 1934–1936), built by Albert Victor Jennings, was the harbinger of planned community developments after WW1 and is listed under the National Trust due to its state heritage significance.
* The stained glass memorial windows of the Uniting Church (formerly St Giles Presbyterian) are listed in the Victorian War Memorial Register.
* Despite its listing in the Heritage Overlay, the original 1922 Murrumbeena Railway Station building (Arts and Crafts features), footbridge and associated gardens were demolished in 2017 to make way for the elevated rail project.

Other listed significant features include:
* Springthorpe Reserve Gates, in Neerim Road, is the last remnant of the Old Melbourne Hospital, founded in 1846-48 and important as the city&#x27;s first public hospital.
* Andreas Svensson Pipe Organ (circa 1900–1910), in St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church at 371 Neerim Road, is the only identifiable example of the leading builder&#x27;s work and retains its original pipework.
* Murrumbeena Baptist Church (1962), 44 Murrumbeena Road, ‘is aesthetically significant as an unusual example of post-WW2 ecclesiastical architecture incorporating historicist references in a modernist framework.’ Significant features of the stark post-WW2 modernist building, designed by architect Eric Lyon, include the tall hall-like structure with zigzag roof, narrow copper spirelets and a façade of angled bays to the Murrumbeena Road elevation, and rose windows with coloured glazing to the Sydney Street elevation. It was included in the City of Glen Eira Heritage Review 2020.

&quot;Butterfly House,&quot; 38 Kangaroo Road, was designed as a template for modern sustainable design in established suburbs.

==Arts and culture==

One of the most significant artistic groups in mid 20th-century Melbourne gathered at &quot;Open Country&quot;, the Boyd family property in Murrumbeena.
&quot;Outer Circle: The Boyds and the Murrumbeena Artists&quot; (NGV Australia 2014) presented the works created by Merric Boyd, Australia&#x27;s first studio potter, Arthur Boyd, John Perceval and others at Open Country and the Arthur Merric Boyd (AMB) Pottery on Neerim Road.

In 1954–56, Arthur Boyd was commissioned to create the ceramic Olympic Pylon, known as &quot;Totem Pole&quot;, here for the Olympic Pool in Melbourne. The heritage-registered sculpture is now erected outside the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre.

Colourful sculptures tower above the Murrumbeena Community Garden beds (planted with a variety of vegetables, sunflowers and Indigenous herbs) and painted furniture at Anthony Breslin&#x27;s Community Art Project. The surrounding walls feature works of Breslin (including frogs) and other local artists, an extensive mural wall displays hundreds of tiles created by local primary school students, and a sustainable water garden feature sits alongside the shed. It is reached via the driveway of Murrumbeena Uniting Church, 117 Murrumbeena Road.

In 2021, Murrumbeena also became the home to a colourful 40-metre long mural on Railway Parade, &quot;The Story of Big Frog&quot;, based on Breslin&#x27;s children&#x27;s book, &quot;BREZANIA&quot;.

==Education==

Murrumbeena Primary School is an International Baccalaureate World School and Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Program participant. The school building is on the Victorian Heritage Database due to its architectural significance. Six sculpture totem poles were created here in conjunction with ceramic artist-in-residence Ursula Dutkiewicz in 2008. Significant events in the school&#x27;s history include:
* 1910 – Current site purchased
* 1917 – Current site occupied (opening with five teachers and 250 students)
* 1929 – School swimming pool built

St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School is a Catholic school located next to the church of the same name.

Murrumbeena High School originally occupied a large parcel of land on the corner of Murrumbeena Road and North Road at 801 North Rd, Murrumbeena 3163, across the road from Duncan McKinnon Reserve. Significant events in its history include:
* 13 August 1974 – The school&#x27;s art block was burnt down.
* 1990 – Renamed as Murrumbeena Secondary College.
* 1996 – Murrumbeena Secondary College was closed by the Kennett Government, part of a widespread closure of schools that led to a shortage of educational options within a few years. It &#x27;merged&#x27; with Prahran High School (also closed) and Caulfield Secondary to form Glen Eira Secondary College. The site was sold to make way for a housing estate.

==Parks and recreation==

Forming part of the Outer Circle Railway Linear Park, Boyd Park was named after the artistically talented Boyd family, and links with the Urban Forest at its northern end on Dandenong Road. The leafy park is surrounded by gum trees and has broad, open areas with a small playground and BBQ pavilion. &quot;Open Country&quot;, a bronze sculpture by Lenore Boyd representing Merric Boyd&#x27;s vision of life in early Murrumbeena, is mounted on a boulder nearby the park&#x27;s Neerim Road entry. The southern end features majestic 250-year-old River Red Gum trees, a bordering post and rail fence, and some of the last remnant indigenous forest in the region, which includes endangered native orchids. Regular wildlife throughout Boyd Park includes brush tail and ringtail possums, 21 recorded native bird species (including owls and tawny frogmouth), geckos and microbats. The endangered Swift Parrot has been monitored foraging amongst the River Red Gums and winter-flowering golden wattle here and near Murrumbeena and Carnegie stations on its annual migration to Tasmania. The eastern koel, with its mournful nighttime cry, was recorded in Murrumbeena in 2022 and 2023.

At the end of the park is a mosaic pavement by artist Donna Leslie, reflecting the ecological harmony, balance and interdependence of the natural elements of our environment in a Koori design. The nearby Caulfield 9th (Murrumbeena) Scout Hall takes advantage of its park/bush environment and is the only group with an animal emblem (the frog) in the state.

The entry to Springthorpe Gardens features the original old gates of the Royal Melbourne Hospital (prior to 1860), which were presented to J. W. Springthorpe, who was a revered physician at the hospital and wrote many medical texts. The park was developed and named after him in 1934.

Murrumbeena Park on Kangaroo Road has an expansive discovery playground with dry riverbed, flying fox, climbing tower, maze, BBQ and picnic facilities. The two established ovals are predominantly used by the Murrumbeena Football Club and Cricket Club. Nearby is an off-leash dog-walking area. Murrumbeena Park Bowls Club is on the park&#x27;s western boundary.

Duncan McKinnon Reserve, on the corner of Murrumbeena and North Roads, features an athletics facility, netball courts, sporting grounds and playground. The open access, 1.2 km fitness track around the perimeter includes an &#x27;outdoor gym&#x27; with balance beam, bench, horizontal bar, jump touch, monkey bars, pull up bar, push up bar and step. Murrumbeena Relay for Life is held at the Duncan McKinnon Athletics Track annually to raise money for the Cancer Council.

Mallanbool Reserve, off Murrumbeena Road and Leila Road, is a cultural and botanical trail for visitors to learn about the original inhabitants of the area, the Kulin. Its trails connect to Packer Park.

===Walking trails===
The historical Boyd Walk commences in Murrumbeena Village opposite Murrumbeena Station and connects eight sites of historical significance. It tells the story of Murrumbeena&#x27;s artistic heritage and local life of the Boyd family and associated artists who completed significant works in the area.

The Kulin Nation Trail through Mallanbool Reserve is an interpretive cultural and botanical trail telling the stories of the original Indigenous owners of the area.

The 17 km-long Djerring Trail, which runs under the elevated rail pylons, was completed in 2018. The leafy, shared pedestrian/bike path has exercise stations, and links Murrumbeena to Hughesdale (east) and Carnegie (west).

1000 Steps in Murrumbeena - Murrumbeena is reasonably flat apart from the dip between Murrumbeena and Hughesdale Stations. From the ground-level Murrumbeena Station to its platforms, there are 60 steps (4 flights of 15 stairs). A 1000-step challenge will require 16 full sections from bottom to top and a 17th to the end of the 3rd section. (Escalators and lifts don’t count.)

===Cycling===
Numerous cycling connections traverse Murrumbeena, including the 17 km-long Djerring Trail, which runs under and alongside the rail corridor from Caulfield to Dandenong.

A shared path through Boyd Park (along the Outer Circle Railway) connects to Gardiners Creek Trail on the other side of Dandenong Road then onto the Yarra Trail and Scotchmans Creek Trail. A bike repair station is alongside the path in Boyd Park.

Rosstown Rail Trail runs east–west along Murrumbeena Crescent.

The shared bike and parking lane along Murrumbeena Road runs north–south connecting to Dandenong Road and extending along East Boundary Road.

<text>Ormond is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 12 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Glen Eira local government area. Ormond recorded a population of 8,328 at the 2021 census.

Ormond&#x27;s postcode is 3204 south of Leila Road and 3163 north of Leila Road. It is bordered by Tucker Road on the eastern side, Koornang Road on the northern side, Thomas Street on the western side and Murray Road and Blackshaw Street on the southern side.

The suburb is named after pastoralist, politician and philanthropist Francis Ormond.

==History==

An Ormond Post Office opened on 1 January 1870 and closed in 1884. It reopened in 1907. Ormond East Post Office was open from 1951 until 1981.

In 1905, Abraham Lewis begun operations of a timber mill in the then market garden estates of Ormond (formerly East Brighton) as the surrounding subdivision began to grow. Furthermore, in the early 1930-40&#x27;s the Lewis family purchased a larger piece of land neighbouring market gardens on the corner of Jasper Road and Jasper Street. At this site, A. Lewis &amp; Company PTY LTD was built and continues to this day in the same family ownership and operations.

In the mid-1900s the council changed the street name to Lewis Street to avoid confusion between the main road and side street being both named Jasper as those in the area simply referred to the street as &quot;the one Lewis&#x27;s is on&quot;. In the 1980s Laurence Lewis (Jr) donated Box Cottage from the recently acquired Reitman&#x27;s concreting works which neighboured the property to the Moorabbin Historical Society and was removed piece by piece; it was then rebuilt in Joyce Park with timber donated from the timber mill operations to original specification.

Originally supplying the surrounding estates builders with timber skirting, architraves and framing materials, many of which can still be purchased in the exact style original to the design hand shaped by Abraham Lewis. The business still manufactures the same mouldings of timber by Abraham&#x27;s descendants with three of the five generations currently assisting in all areas of the business.

==Today==

Port Phillip Bay glimpses are possible from some of the elevated homes in the south-west corner of the suburb, with the bay itself being about 4 km away. Ormond contains numerous churches and parks, including E.E Gunn reserve, home to the Ormond Amateur Football Club, Ormond Tennis Club, Ormond Cricket Club and Ormond-Glen Huntly Baseball Club. The suburb is also home to Kilvington Grammar School, a private school located in Leila Road, and Mckinnon Primary School.

The Ormond shopping strip is located primarily on North Road, and has declined since its heyday in the middle of last century, as North Road carries large volumes of traffic. It is home to an impressive array of restaurants however, with upwards of 10 different cuisine styles on offer. This variety reflects the multiculturalism of Melbourne.

The original housing stock of Ormond was generally constructed between 1890 and 1950, with some minor infill occurring after that time. Californian bungalow-style houses are common, and many &quot;dog box&quot; cream brick apartment buildings were constructed in the 1960s. The last 15 years has seen a rise in property prices in Ormond, with higher quality developments becoming common, including numerous modern three-storey apartment buildings in and around the shopping strip in North Road.

The suburb is serviced by the Ormond railway station, on the frequent Frankston line.

<text>The following is a list of types of seafood. Seafood is any form of sea life regarded as food by humans. It prominently includes shellfish, and roe. Shellfish include various species of molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. In most parts of the world, fish are generally not considered seafood even if they are from the sea. In the US, the term &quot;seafood&quot; is extended to fresh water organisms eaten by humans, so any edible aquatic life may be broadly referred to as seafood in the US. Historically, sea mammals such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants, such as some seaweeds and microalgae, are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia (see the category of edible seaweeds).

<text>Malvern ( ) is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 8 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Stonnington local government area. Malvern recorded a population of 9,929 at the 2021 census.

==History==

The first people to live in the Malvern area were the Kulin people. The Yarra River and Gardiners Creek approximates the boundary of two Kulin groups, with the Boonwurrung to the south and the Wurundjeri to the north. 
According to Alfred Howitt, the rising area in Malvern from the junction of Wattletree Road and Dandenong Road (Princes Highway) was known as Koornang by the Kulin people, which meant &#x27;rising ground&#x27;. The name was used for Koornang Road, which runs south of Malvern, through Carnegie. 

The area of Malvern was first settled by Europeans in 1835. John Gardiner was one of the first Europeans to make his home in the general area. A small hamlet known as &quot;Gardiners Creek&quot; (1851 Melbourne Postal Directory) was established, but it diminished with the gold rush. The nearby creek was also named Gardiners Creek. Gardiners Creek Road (now Toorak Road) ran from South Yarra, east to the junction of Gardiners Creek and onto the Gardiner Homestead, which is now the site of Scotch College in Hawthorn. According to Howitt&#x27;s notes, the place where Gardiner made his home was called in the Woiwurrung language. 

In the 1860s the Gardiners Creek Roads Board was the forerunner of the Gardiners Creek Shire that then became Malvern Council.

Malvern Post Office opened on 1 January 1860 on Glenferrie Road, near Malvern Road. In 1892 this was renamed Malvern North when a new Malvern office on Glenferrie Road, near Wattletree Road, replaced the Malvern railway station office.

The then shire hall (later town hall) was built in 1886, on the corner of Glenferrie Road and High Street and later extended.

Prahran &amp; Malvern Tramways Trust ran their first car out of Malvern depot on 30 May 1910.

Malvern is the original home of Malvern Star, once Australia&#x27;s largest and most well-known bicycle manufacturer.

==Attractions==

The main shopping attraction is Malvern Central, home to David Jones, Woolworths and BWS as well as forty other stores, mostly fashion stores like Cotton On Kids. Glenferrie Road is also Malvern&#x27;s main shopping attraction, which has shops as well as a wide variety of restaurants and boutiques.

There are several Victorian parks and gardens in Malvern, including Malvern Gardens, in Spring Road. This park has a beautiful fountain which was built on the site of a natural spring. The water used to flow naturally, but as the land was developed, the water feeding the spring was interrupted, and the fountain is now run by electricity.

The Malvern Town Hall, in the Second Empire style, is where the Stonnington City Council meets and is opposite the corporate headquarters known as the Stonnington City Centre, which is also home to the Malvern Police Station and the Stonnington Council.

Significant heritage buildings listed on the Victorian Heritage Register include Stonington mansion (1890), Malvern tram depot, the former ES&amp;A Bank (on the corner of Glenferrie Road and High Street) and Malvern railway station.

Other significant buildings include St Joseph&#x27;s Parish Church (Roman Catholic) and De La Salle College tower building. There is also an Anglican parish church dedicated to St George and the Malvern Presbyterian Church.

The Malvern Police Station is located at 288 Glenferrie Road opposite the new Stonnington council building and next to the town hall. Malvern Police Station was the first Station in the state to receive the new Ford Ranger Divisional Van. Malvern Police Station is also home to Protective Service Officers with the Transit Division.

==Transport==


The Malvern tram depot, located on Glenferrie Road (off Coldbo Road, Armadale), provides trams for the various routes which service Malvern.

Malvern railway station is a busy station on the Frankston, Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, which has four platforms, three of which are in full operation. It is located on Station Street, Malvern (off Glenferrie Road). In addition, Tooronga station also services the northern section of the suburb, on the Glen Waverley line.

There are also various bus stops across Malvern and a train replacement stop outside Malvern station (Dandenong Road).

<text>A rotameter is a device that measures the volumetric flow rate of fluid in a closed tube.

It belongs to a class of meters called variable-area flowmeters, which measure flow rate by allowing the cross-sectional area the fluid travels through to vary, causing a measurable effect.

==History==

The first variable area meter with rotating float was invented by Karl Kueppers (1874–1933) in Aachen in 1908. This is described in the German patent 215225. Felix Meyer founded the company &quot;Deutsche Rotawerke GmbH&quot; in Aachen recognizing the fundamental importance of this invention. They improved this invention with new shapes of the float and of the glass tube. Kueppers invented the special shape for the inside of the glass tube that realized a symmetrical flow scale.

The brand name Rotameter was registered by the British company GEC Elliot automation, Rotameter Co. In many other countries the brand name Rotameter is registered by Rota Yokogawa GmbH &amp; Co. KG in Germany which is now owned by Yokogawa Electric Corp.

==Description==

A rotameter consists of a tapered tube, typically made of glass with a &#x27;float&#x27; (a shaped weight, made either of anodized aluminum or a ceramic), inside that is pushed up by the drag force of the flow and pulled down by gravity. The drag force for a given fluid and float cross section is a function of flow speed squared only, see drag equation.

A higher volumetric flow rate through a given area increases flow speed and drag force, so the float will be pushed upwards. However, as the inside of the rotameter is cone shaped (widens), the area around the float through which the medium flows increases, the flow speed and drag force decrease until there is mechanical equilibrium with the float&#x27;s weight.

Floats are made in many different shapes, with spheres and ellipsoids being the most common. The float may be diagonally grooved and partially colored so that it rotates axially as the fluid passes. This shows if the float is stuck since it will only rotate if it is free. Readings are usually taken at the top of the widest part of the float; the center for an ellipsoid, or the top for a cylinder. Some manufacturers use a different standard.

The &quot;float&quot; must not float in the fluid: it has to have a higher density than the fluid, otherwise it will float to the top even if there is no flow.

The mechanical nature of the measuring principle provides a flow measurement device that does not require any electrical power. If the tube is made of metal, the float position is transferred to an external indicator via a magnetic coupling. This capability has considerably expanded the range of applications for the variable area flowmeter, since the measurement can observed remotely from the process or used for automatic control.

==Advantages==

* A rotameter requires no external power or fuel, it uses only the inherent properties of the fluid, along with gravity, to measure flow rate.
* A rotameter is also a relatively simple device that can be mass manufactured out of cheap materials, allowing for its widespread use.
* Since the area of the flow passage increases as the float moves up the tube, the scale is approximately linear.
*Clear glass is used which is highly resistant to thermal shock and chemical action.

==Disadvantages==

* Due to its reliance on the ability of the fluid or gas to displace the float, graduations on a given rotameter will only be accurate for a given substance at a given temperature. The main property of importance is the density of the fluid; however, viscosity may also be significant. Floats are ideally designed to be insensitive to viscosity; however, this is seldom verifiable from manufacturers&#x27; specifications. Either separate rotameters for different densities and viscosities may be used, or multiple scales on the same rotameter can be used.
*Because operation of a rotameter depends on the force of gravity for operation, a rotameter must be oriented vertically. Significant error can result if the orientation deviates significantly from the vertical.
* Due to the direct flow indication the resolution is relatively poor compared to other measurement principles. Readout uncertainty gets worse near the bottom of the scale. Oscillations of the float and parallax may further increase the uncertainty of the measurement.
* Since the float must be read through the flowing medium, some fluids may obscure the reading. A transducer may be required for electronically measuring the position of the float. 
* Rotameters are not easily adapted for reading by machine; although magnetic floats that drive a follower outside the tube are available.
* Rotameters are not generally manufactured in sizes greater than 6 inches/150 mm, but bypass designs are sometimes used on very large pipes.

<text>South Yarra is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 4 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Melbourne and Stonnington local government areas. South Yarra recorded a population of 25,028 at the 2021 census.

Punt Road divides the suburb between Stonnington (east) and Melbourne (west). The main shopping region of South Yarra runs along Toorak Road and Chapel Street. Trade along these two arteries are focused on trendy and upmarket shopping, restaurants, nightclubs and cafe culture. The area of South Yarra centred along Commercial Road was for several decades one of Melbourne&#x27;s gay villages.

South Yarra is also home to some of Melbourne&#x27;s most prestigious residential addresses. Residential land price records (per square metre) have been set by properties in Domain Road, Walsh Street and Fairlie Court.

==History==

South Yarra was originally inhabited by the Yalukit-willam clan of the Boonwurrung people who called the area &quot;Terneet&quot;, the meaning of which has been lost.

The area was settled by British colonists in the late 1830s, not long after the establishment of Melbourne. The first sale of land by the Crown in Prahran area took place on 10 June 1840 when land bounded by Kooyong Road, Gardiners Creek (Yarra River). Gardiners Creek Road (now Toorak Road) and Glenferrie Road was sold. The purchasers included Jane Hill (the widow of pastoralist David Hill), the Langhorne Bros. (the nephews of Captain William Lonsdale), Capt. John Browne, James Jackson and George Augustus Robinson who was the Chief Protector of Aborigines in the region. 

During the 1840s, it became popular with wealthy citizens of Melbourne as a suburban retreat from the town. Several large houses were built and, together with neighbouring Toorak, it maintained its upper-class reputation into the post-World War II period. South Yarra Post Office was open briefly in 1854, then reopened on 21 June 1858.



During the 1920s and 1930s, many of the large gardens of the older mansions were subdivided and blocks of flats became a feature of the area. From the 1930s, the area around Park Street, where large numbers of flats had been built, became a popular neighbourhood for middle-class homosexuals; at that time an illegal subculture in the state of Victoria.

The building of apartment buildings, particularly around South Yarra railway station, continued into the 1960s and 1970s and today South Yarra is one of the most densely populated suburbs in Melbourne.

On 12 October 1988, police officers Steven Tynan and Damian Eyre were murdered in Walsh Street, South Yarra.

On 8 July 2002, the Salt nightclub in Daly Street was the site of a dispute which resulted in the murder of three men. On 19 September 2005, seven men were found guilty of murder, in the Supreme Court of Victoria. The nightclub was particularly notorious for criminal activity and was finally shut down.

==Population==

In the 2016 census, there were 25,147 people in South Yarra. 51.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 5.7%, England 4.5%, New Zealand 3.4%, India 2.2% and Malaysia 1.6%. 63.8% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 6.3%, Cantonese 1.6%, Greek 1.5%, Spanish 1.4% and Russian 1.4%. The most common responses for religion in South Yarra were No Religion 42.6% and Catholic 16.0%.

==Local landmarks==
South Yarra has several local attractions. Perhaps the best known is Chapel Street. The South Yarra section of the famous street is the most fashionable and upmarket end. A major landmark is The Jam Factory, old factories converted into an upmarket shopping centre and cinemas. &quot;The Como Centre&quot; is a large shopping centre on the corner of Toorak and Chapel Streets, which combines with an office building, South Yarra&#x27;s tallest, which houses the headquarters for ATV-10 and Global Television&#x27;s TV production facilities.

The Prahran Market, located in South Yarra, is one of Melbourne&#x27;s most popular and historic fresh produce markets.

Toorak Road runs off Chapel Street and although not known as well as Toorak Village, is a popular strip that contains a wide range of shops.

There are also several heritage registered buildings in South Yarra, including the Melbourne High School (1928), the former railway station building (1874) and post office (1893).

===Residential architecture===
Many historic mansions can be found in South Yarra. Heritage registered houses include Como House (1847), one of Melbourne&#x27;s earliest mansions on its large estate on Williams Road, now owned by the National Trust and known for its long association with the Armytage family, &quot;Richmond House&quot; (1859), in Avoca Street, formerly home to Sir Rupert Clarke Bt, &quot;Barwon&quot; (1881) and &quot;Airlie House&quot; on Domain Road, once the townhouse of the Chirnside family of Werribee Park fame, which now serves as a leadership college for Victoria Police.

Other grand South Yarra houses include Wavendon, formerly home to film director Fred Schepisi, in Walsh Street, and Raveloe, in Domain Road, former home of Dame Mabel Brookes. Domain Road, with its proximity to the Kings Domain, the Royal Botanic Gardens and Government House, is at the centre of the exclusive Domain precinct. Fairbairn, built for the pastoralist Fairbairn family and the next-door property, Poolman House, on the corner of Domain Road and Punt Road, are among the largest mansions in South Yarra. Poolman House, originally known as Ernest Poolman House, was built by stock and station agent Richard Goldsbrough in 1865 and extended in 1880. Poolman House was owned by the Poolman family from 1921, who entertained grandly in the ballroom that they added in 1928. In 1956 Mrs Audrey Poolman donated the house to Christ Church South Yarra, who used it as a nursing home for genteel old Anglican ladies for thirty years, until in 1986, the house was bought from the Church of England by international interior designer the late John Coote, who restored Poolman House at vast expense. Snainton at 80 Clowes Street, South Yarra, is a notable example of grand Federation architecture, as is its sister property at 72 Clowes Street, South Yarra, which sold for a notable $8.8 million in 2008. Caroline House, a Victorian mansion with a tower at 72 Caroline Street, changed hands in 2014 by way of off market transaction for $12.5 million. Caroline House was formerly home to Australia&#x27;s foremost art dealer Joseph Brown who between 1966 and 1999 gifted 154 works of art valued at $30 million to the National Gallery of Victoria.

South Yarra also has some notable clusters of terrace house. Park Street features rows of Melbourne&#x27;s best preserved, richly decorated and highly sought-after Victorian terrace houses, some as high as three and four storeys. Adjacent Leopold Street has a highly original Victorian streetscape being lined on both sides by Victorian terraces built during the 1880s land boom. Domain Road, Toorak Road West (overlooking Fawkner Park), Surrey Road as well as Darling and Caroline Streets are also known for their double-storey late 19th century terraces.

An important area for Art Deco enthusiasts can be found along Alexandra Avenue, Lawson Grove and Darling Street. This area was subject to renewal in the 1920s and 1930s by entrepreneurial builder Mr Lawson, as a kind of medium-density village enclave development. As a result, a large number of Art Deco apartment buildings were built in a Hollywood Hills style overlooking the Yarra River. One of the most famous of these apartment buildings, &quot;Beverly Hills&quot;, on Darling Street, retains the original 1930s grotto-style swimming pool for the use of all residents. Nearby in Lawson Grove the Lawson Grove Café can be found on the ground floor of a 1930s Art Deco building. It was originally intended to run as a convenience store for local residents, but is now a chic café for those in the know.

The Beverley Hills Apartment Block is a 1930s development in the Spanish Mission style.

===Places of worship===

The synagogue of the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, which was built in 1929 to the design of Nahum Barnet, features a giant order portico and a great copper dome. It is the largest synagogue structure in Australasia.

Christ Church is an historic Anglican church located on the corner of Toorak and Punt Roads. Its tall spire is a landmark. There are several smaller churches secluded in the back streets of South Yarra.

===Public space===

South Yarra&#x27;s parks and gardens include part of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Fawkner Park (large park bordered by offices on St Kilda Road, private residences off Punt Road, Commercial Road and Toorak Road, featuring recreational facilities and grand avenues of trees) and smaller gardens such as the former Greville Botanic Gardens, Como Gardens and the public housing open space.

==Transport==
South Yarra has two railway stations. South Yarra station is on the Pakenham, Cranbourne, Frankston and Sandringham lines. It is the junction for the Sandringham line. Hawksburn station is on the Pakenham, Cranbourne and Frankston lines and serves the eastern part of the suburb.

Tram routes 58, 72 and 78 also run through South Yarra.

Major bus routes run along Commercial Road and Punt Road.

==Education==
Melbourne High School is located in South Yarra, and the 1930s Gothic main building is a local landmark. Melbourne Girls Grammar School Merton Hall campus is located in Anderson Street South Yarra, opposite the Royal Botanical Gardens, while its junior school, Morris Hall, is in Caroline Street South Yarra. Melbourne Grammar School (boys only at senior level) occupies an entire block bounded by Domain Road, St Kilda Road, Domain Street and Bromby Street. It has historic and grand bluestone buildings. In addition, Melbourne Grammar owns many of the terrace houses in Domain Street to provide accommodation for its masters, as well as the grand Victorian terrace house in Domain Road, Creswick House, home to its middle school boarders.

Christ Church Grammar School and South Yarra Primary School, two of Victoria&#x27;s oldest primary schools, are also located in South Yarra.

==Liveability==

A 2005 report called &quot;Liveable Melbourne&quot; that was commissioned by &quot;The Age&quot; and conducted by Tract Consultants and ACIL Tasman, ranked Melbourne suburbs and assigned them scores on fourteen characteristics such as crime, CBD proximity, and traffic congestion. The report found that of all Melbourne suburbs, South Yarra was the most liveable due to good proximity to the CBD, schools, cafes, and restaurants; access to trains, trams, and buses; and abundance of open spaces and trees.

==Localities in South Yarra==

Hawksburn is a locality in the eastern part of South Yarra, bordering Toorak. It is probably best known for its railway station and nearby &quot;Hawksburn Village&quot;, a small strip shopping centre on Malvern Road. Many of South Yarra&#x27;s older homes and terraces are located close to Cromwell Crescent and the Hawksburn railway station. Hawksburn Post Office opened in 1890.

The Domain Precinct is the most prestigious part of South Yarra, traditionally home to many of Melbourne&#x27;s old money families. Bordered by Punt Road, Toorak Road West, Anderson Street, St Kilda Road and Alexandra Avenue, the Domain Precinct has recorded some of Victoria&#x27;s highest land values on a square metre basis. Driven by proximity to Government House, the Central Business District and the Botanical Gardens, Fawkner Park, and Melbourne&#x27;s elite private schools and boutique shopping, this area is graced with both large mansions, terrace houses and high-end apartments. The most valuable streets include Walsh Street, Fairlie Court, Park Street, Clowes Street, Anderson Street, Domain Road and Marne Street.

==Sport==

The South Yarra Football Club, an Australian rules football team, competes in the Southern Football League.

The Melbourne High School Old Boys Football Club have three teams that compete in the Victorian Amateur Football Association. Their home ground is based at Melbourne High School, where weekly matches are played on the Woodfull-Miller oval, the school&#x27;s sole football oval.

There are two tennis clubs, both of which are over 100 years old. Royal South Yarra which is a large club having both grass and en-tout-cas courts and Hawksburn Tennis Club in the heart of South Yarra with 3 en-tout-cas courts. Courts are also available for public hire at Fawkner Park, Prahran Community Centre and Orrong Park.

<text>Toorak () is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Stonnington local government area. Toorak recorded a population of 12,817 at the 2021 census.

The name Toorak has become synonymous with wealth and privilege, the suburb long having the reputation of being Melbourne&#x27;s most elite, and ranking among the most prestigious in Australia. It has the highest average property values in Melbourne, and is one of the most expensive suburbs in Australia. It is the nation&#x27;s second highest earning postcode after Point Piper in Sydney.

Located on a rise on the south side (or left bank) of a bend in the Yarra River, Toorak is bordered by South Yarra, at Williams Road on the west, Malvern, at Glenferrie Road on the east, Prahran and Armadale, at Malvern Road to the south and the suburbs of Richmond, Burnley and Hawthorn on the north side of the river. The suburb&#x27;s main street is considered to be Toorak Road, on which the commercial area of Toorak Village is located.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Toorak was named after Toorak House, an Italianate residence built in 1849 by merchant James Jackson. The name of the house may have originated from the Woiwurrung language of the indigenous inhabitants, with words of similar pronunciation meaning &quot;black crow&quot; or &quot;reedy swamp&quot;.

===Toorak House===

From 1854 Toorak House served as the residence of the first Governor of Victoria, Captain Sir Charles Hotham KCB RN and his successors, until the completion of the present Government House (1876) in the Kings Domain.

Toorak Post Office opened around June 1858.

===1880s land boom===
During the land boom of the 1880s, many large and elaborate mansions were erected in Toorak, often in the Italianate style. Following East Melbourne and then St Kilda, Toorak, along with Brighton, became the new favored location for the wealthy.

===1890s depression===
The suburb was hit particularly hard by the 1890s economic depression and many wealthy landowners declared bankruptcy and were forced to sell. Nonetheless, the suburb remained and is still Melbourne&#x27;s home of &quot;old money&quot;. During the Interwar period, many houses were built in the Tudor revival style; many houses were also designed by society Architect Marcus Martin in the Moderne style over a Georgian building form.

===Post-war era===
In the period of post-World War II prosperity, rising standards of living and land values caused Toorak to become highly sought after by a new generation of the wealthy, thought by some to be social climbers and nouveau riche. For some of these people, the focus was simply to have the postcode of Toorak, which was SE 2 and now 3142. As a result, many of the larger mansions were demolished and large holdings were subdivided to make way for flats, townhouses and apartments.

In the 1980s, larger houses in Neo-Georgian and Neo-Classical styles began to appear.

===Contemporary Toorak===
While large mansions have survived in neighbouring Hawthorn, Kew and Armadale, only a few of the original 19th-century mansions in Toorak remain, due in part to the high land value. Two of the most notable are Illawarra House, which was acquired by the National Trust; and Coonac, the most expensive house in Melbourne. In Toorak, some of the old property names live on as street names or the names of blocks of flats, carved out of or built on their sites; Dunraven Avenue, Millicent Avenue, Iona Avenue, Woorigoleen Road, Myoora Road, and Scotsburn Grove are examples.

===Housing===
Toorak has an unusual mix of high-, low- and medium-density housing, due to intense subdivision of larger lots in the 1880s, 1920s and 1960s. The predominant housing in Toorak (49.6%) is apartments, particularly walk-up flats.

Single-family detached homes are also prevalent (30.2%). Some of these homes are in the form of traditional mansions or newer large residences on significant-sized estates, owned by Melbourne&#x27;s wealthy and social elite. The architectural style of the mansions is predominantly Italianate and colonial. 
There are also extant stands of semi-detached housing (20.1%), including terraces, which were traditionally fashionable with the middle class and later gentrified.

==Politics==

Toorak falls within the federal electorate of Higgins. The seat of Higgins was created in 1949 and held by Harold Holt CH 1949–1967, Sir John Gorton PC GCMG AC CH 1968–1975, Roger Shipton OAM 1975–1990, Peter Costello AC 1990–2009, Kelly O&#x27;Dwyer 2009–2019 and Katie Allen 2019–2022 (all on behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia). However, the seat would fall to the Labor Party for the first time ever in the 2022 Federal Election, with candidate Michelle Ananda-Rajah winning the seat as Labor took government from the coalition.

At State level, it mostly falls within the electorate of Malvern (currently held by the Liberals&#x27; Michael O&#x27;Brien) since the 2006 Victorian State Election, with the western part of the suburb falling within the electorate of Prahran (currently held by Sam Hibbins on behalf the Australian Greens). At local council level, Toorak falls within the City of Stonnington.

Toorak has historically voted for conservative political parties. The Liberal Party retained the seat of Malvern in the 2018 State Election, although there was a 10.1% swing to the Australian Labor Party.

==Toorak Village==
The Toorak Village features a number of shops, restaurants and cafes, located centrally in Toorak Road. Recent mixed-use developments including St. Germain, have increased the number of offices within Toorak Village.

==Places of worship==

* Saint John&#x27;s Anglican Church, an 1862 Gothic Revival bluestone church, designed by William Wardell, dominates the skyline of Toorak, with a large tower including a peal of bells and a distinctive sandstone broach spire. The church was formally established at a meeting held on 21 November 1859. Those present were Messrs Alfred Ross, H. W. Dauglish, J. Goodman, Allan Spowers, John Steavenson, Jas Blackwood, J. Quarterman, W. M. Hammill, H. W. Farrar, George Hull, Captain Sawell, W. T. Wood, P. Gunning, E. Davis, J. Slater, G. Guillaume and son. Construction began in April 1860, and was completed on 23 October 1860. The ground for the church buildings was selected by Bishop Parry at what was the entrance to the Orrong Estate, which was the property of Mr Alfred Ross. The foundation stone was laid by the Governor, Sir Henry Barkly. Saint John&#x27;s, Toorak is one of the most popular wedding venue churches in Australia. 

* Saint Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, built in 1876 in the Gothic style and extended in 1934. A campanile was added during renovations in 2018. 

* Toorak Uniting Church (1876), in the Frenchified Gothic style

* Swedish Church

The Wesleyan Church (1877), formerly on the corner of Toorak and Williams Roads, was illegally demolished in 1990 by developers and later replaced by a block of flats.

==Schools==

Schools in Toorak include St Catherine&#x27;s School, Loreto Mandeville Hall, St Kevin&#x27;s College, Glamorgan (now Toorak Campus, the junior school of Geelong Grammar School) and Toorak Central School (1890).

==Sport==

The Royal South Yarra Lawn Tennis Club was founded in 1884 and is located in Toorak. Kooyong Stadium, former home of the Australian Open, is located on Glenferrie Road.

==Transport ==
The most popular form of transport in Toorak is the automobile. CityLink runs along north eastern Toorak, though there are no interchanges within the suburb, although there is access to the freeway via MacRobertson Bridge and interchanges at Burnley. Main arterials running north–south are Williams Road (at the eastern boundary), Grange Road, Orrong Road, St Georges Road and Kooyong Road. The east–west arterials include Alexandra Avenue (at the northern boundary), Toorak Road (which runs midway through the suburb) and Malvern Road (at the southern boundary). Alexandra Avenue becomes St Georges Road and both along with Grange Road feed onto the MacRobertson Bridge, Toorak&#x27;s main river crossing.

Toorak&#x27;s road planning is an example of street hierarchy. As a result, there are numerous quiet pedestrian streets. However, traffic congestion is an increasing problem along Toorak Road and Williams Roads. There is limited street parking along the main roads with just a couple of multi-storey car parks and parking lots within proximity of the main Toorak Road shopping strip. There are no level crossings in Toorak. There is a perception in popular culture of the luxury 4WD as a status symbol, (controversial for their comfort rather than for their off-road abilities) and this has been associated with the suburb of Toorak, such that in popular Australian culture, the term &#x27;Toorak Tractor&#x27; has become well established in Australian slang. An example of this was an episode of the popular program &quot;Top Gear Australia&quot;, aired on SBS TV, in which the presenters, tongue-in-cheek, drove a $200,000 tractor along Toorak Road.

Toorak&#x27;s only railway station is Heyington, on the Glen Waverley line, which crosses the Yarra from Richmond on the Heyington Railway Bridge, to the suburb&#x27;s north. Despite its name, Toorak railway station is located in Armadale. The Pakenham, Frankston and Cranbourne railway line group to which this station belongs runs close to Toorak&#x27;s southern boundary. Other nearby stations include Hawksburn, in South Yarra and Kooyong, in Kooyong.

Trams have run down Toorak Road since 1888. Route 58 runs along Toorak Road to Glenferrie Road, at the suburb&#x27;s eastern boundary. Route 72 runs along Malvern Road, the suburb&#x27;s southern boundary.

Cycling facilities are poor, with few marked on road lanes. MacRobertson Bridge and Gardiners Creek pedestrian bridge, however, the bridge provides pedestrians access to the Main Yarra Trail and shared bicycle and pedestrian paths in nearby Burnley. Pedestrians are serviced by an extensive network of footpaths and pedestrian crossings.

<doc id="617320" wikidata="Q7414344" url="?curid=617320" title="San Jacinto Peak">
<text>San Jacinto Peak ( ; often designated Mount San Jacinto) is a peak in the San Jacinto Mountains, in Riverside County, California. Lying within Mount San Jacinto State Park it is the highest both in the range and the county, and serves as the southern border of the San Gorgonio Pass.

San Jacinto Peak is one of the most topographically prominent peaks in the United States, and is ranked the sixth most prominent peak in the 48 contiguous states. According to John W. Robinson and Bruce D. Risher, authors of &quot;The San Jacintos,&quot; &quot;No Southern California hiker worth his salt would miss climbing &#x27;San Jack&#x27; at least once.&quot;

Known for its spectacular north escarpment, the peak rises over above San Gorgonio Pass. It plays host to the famous Cactus to Clouds Trail.

== Geography ==
To the east of San Jacinto, the peak towers over the city of Palm Springs (elevation 479 ft; 146 m); to the west, it borders the mountain community of Idyllwild (elevation 5,413 ft; 1,650 m). The peak is also frequently called Mount San Jacinto. The steep escarpment of its north face, above Snow Creek, climbs over in . This is one of the largest gains in elevation over such a small horizontal distance in the contiguous United States.

From the peak, San Gorgonio Mountain can be seen across the San Gorgonio Pass. Also easily visible below is the Coachella Valley and the Salton Sea. In addition, much of the Inland Empire, including Ontario to the west, can be viewed on a clear day.

Named after Hyacinth of Caesarea, Mount San Jacinto is one of the &quot;Four Saints,&quot; a name occasionally used to describe the high points of the four mountains over 10,000 feet named for Catholic saints in Southern California: San Jacinto Peak, Mount San Gorgonio (high point of the San Bernardino Mountains), San Bernardino Peak, and Mount San Antonio (high point of the San Gabriel Mountains).

===Climate===
== History ==
The peak is known to the Cahuilla Native Americans as &quot;I a kitch&quot; (or &quot;Aya Kaich&quot;), meaning &quot;smooth cliffs.&quot; It is regarded as the home of &quot;Dakush&quot;, the meteor and legendary founder of the Cahuilla.

In 1878, a Wheeler Survey topographical party led by rancher Charles Thomas of Garner Valley climbed the peak. The Wheeler Survey gave the mountain the name &quot;San Jacinto Peak&quot; (rather than &quot;Mt. San Jacinto&quot; or &quot;San Jacinto Mountain.&quot;)
The earliest recorded ascent of the peak was made in September, 1874 by &quot;F. of Riverside,&quot; according to a description of his ascent in the &quot;San Diego Union&quot;. The first successful ascent of the difficult northeast escarpment was made in 1931 by Floyd Vernoy and Stewart White of Riverside.
The peak is flanked by Jean Peak and Marion Mountain . These peaks were named in 1897 by USGS topographer Edmund Taylor Perkins Jr. Perkins named Jean Peak for his sweetheart and future bride, Jean Waters of Plumas County, whom he married in 1903. He named Marion Mountain after Marion Kelly, his girlfriend, a teacher for the Indian Bureau at the Morongo Valley Reservation. According to a local legend, Perkins spent the summer of 1897 deciding which woman to marry while he conducted his topographical survey of San Jacinto Peak and its environs.

Nearby Cornell Peak is named for Cornell University, the alma mater of geologist Robert T. Hill. Perkins and Hill were camping in Round Valley when Hill remarked that the peak looked like the campanile tower at Cornell. Perkins later named the peak Cornell Peak.

In 1931 and 1932, the San Jacinto Mountain Chamber of Commerce sponsored a Labor Day footrace from Idyllwild to San Jacinto Peak and back, a distance of and a rise of . The 1931 race was won by Tom Humphreys, a Hopi, in 3:36:30. Humphreys won the race again in 1932 with a time of 3:12. Near the summit of San Jacinto peak is a stone hut that was built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps under the direction of Serbo-Croatian immigrant Alfred Zarubicka, a stonemason known in Idyllwild as &quot;Zubi.&quot;

== Hiking ==

San Jacinto Peak is easily accessible, as many trails penetrate the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. The most popular route starts with a ride on the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway from Valley Station at near Palm Springs up to Mountain Station at . From there, one can easily climb the mountain face via trails.
Another route is to hike the Marion Mountain Trail from near the mountain town of Idyllwild.
There is a naturally reproducing but introduced population of Sequoiadendrons planted in 1974 located here hundreds of miles from native populations. 
The Cactus to Clouds Trail involves an arduous climb of approximately from the desert floor in Palm Springs to the summit at . This trail has no water sources until , so early starts are advised to avoid the temperatures which often soar above .

<doc id="617322" wikidata="Q7551630" url="?curid=617322" title="Socialist Action (Australia)">
<text>Socialist Action, known until October 2019 as the Socialist Party, was a Trotskyist political party in Australia. It published a monthly magazine called &quot;The Socialist&quot; which contained a socialist perspective on news and current issues.

==History==
The Socialist Party (Australia) traced its origins to the British Trotyskyist Militant group (now International Socialist Alternative) which organized within the UK Labour Party. It began in 1985 as a small faction within the Australian Labor Party (ALP), when members who had lived in Britain and become members of British Militant returned to Australia to help build an Australian section of the organisation.

The group was originally known as Militant. At that time the ALP was seen by Militant as having &quot;maintained its internal democracy and its active working class membership base&quot;, and so they participated politically within that party. They organised primarily within the New South Wales trade union movement and Young Labor (the youth wing of the ALP). At one point, Militant had control of three Young Labor branches.

During the early 1990s when the ALP and most social democratic parties internationally moved to the right, and after other Marxist groups (including their sister party British Militant) were expelled by Labour parties overseas, Militant left the ALP. They wrote that by that stage it had &quot;played a key role in the introduction of neo-liberal policies and no longer has democratic structures that ensure workers interests are represented&quot;.

After leaving the ALP, the group became known as the Militant Socialist Organisation before becoming the Socialist Party in line with its counterpart in the UK (in 1996 the unrelated group that used to be called the &quot;Socialist Party of Australia&quot; from 1971 changed its name). The name of the organisation&#x27;s monthly newspaper was changed from &quot;The Voice&quot; to &quot;The Socialist&quot;. In May 2012, the eight-page broadsheet format was changed to a longer magazine format.

From 2011 to 2016, SP had two branches in Victoria: city and northern. It reverted to a single branch in March 2016. SP argued for revolutionary socialist politics, while also participating in election campaigns - federal, state and local council. Stephen Jolly was elected to City of Yarra council in 2004. Anthony Main became SP&#x27;s second councilor in January 2011, filling a vacancy created by the election of Jane Garrett to the seat of Brunswick. It argued for the establishment of a new &#x27;mass worker&#x27;s party&#x27; to replace the ALP, based on trade unionism, community participation and a democratic membership.

==Sexual abuse scandals==

On 22 February 2016, 10 members of the SP, including City of Yarra Councillor Stephen Jolly, announced their resignation from the group, claiming that the group was &quot;torn apart by attacks on a woman comrade for coming forward with serious allegations of abuse&quot;. They eventually formed a separate group, The Socialists. The Socialist Party denied any cover-up.

In October 2019, the Socialist Party renamed itself Socialist Action. In 2020, new allegations of rape appeared against the same member accused in 2016. In 2021, their international organisation, International Socialist Alternative (ISA), objected to an alleged 18-month long pattern of harassment of his alleged victim and their supporters within the party. ISA also objected to a financial payment of $32,000 AUD from Socialist Action to the man accused after he resigned working for the party. In response, Socialist Action formally split from ISA. They announced a plan to collaborate with Taiwanese group International Socialist Forward. Their website is no longer active and they have no phone or office address. Those members who opposed Socialist Action&#x27;s stance on sexual assault remained members of the ISA and founded a new section of ISA in Australia in April 2021.

==Campaigns==
The Socialist Party was involved in a range of campaigns. In 1993, members of Militant were heavily involved in a year-long occupation of Richmond Secondary College in an attempt to prevent the school from being closed. This campaign was partially successful, as the schoolgrounds have been maintained as Melbourne Girls College. Militant played a prominent role in campaigns against right-leaning state governments in Victoria and New South Wales during this period.

Socialist Party helped to initiate the Community Campaign for Heroin Reform, and continues to campaign for the establishment of safe injecting facilities.

It was also involved in the campaign for the rights of refugees, including participation in the Woomera Detention Centre protests, and was involved in the anti-globalisation and anti-war movements. Along with a range of other left groups, they also had a presence at the Occupy Melbourne protests. Members often participate in larger protests, including events such as Melbourne&#x27;s annual St Kilda Gay Pride March and May Day rallies. SP has played a role helping to organise left-wing and youth movements against far-right organisations, including the One Nation political party. In Perth, the party has helped to launch the West Australians Against Racism campaign (WAAR).

In 2003 SP initiated a campaign for young casual workers&#x27; rights called Unite, which subsequently became established as Unite Union. In 2012 they initiated a broad campaign over cost-of-living issues in Australia, known as &quot;Fightback!&quot;. The campaign has focused on issues such as free public transport, opposition to TAFE funding cuts, and opposition to cuts on university campuses.

After 2004 they played a prominent role in local council politics in the Yarra area of Melbourne (see below). SP encouraged the formation of resident&#x27;s organisations on housing estates. From 2011-2013, they initiated a campaign with public housing tenants to oppose the sale of land allocated for public housing in Yarra.

On Christmas Eve 2012, the Victorian State Government announced plans to privatise parts of the public housing developments in Fitzroy, Richmond and Prahran, aiming to provide an equal mix of public and private housing by building private developments on parkland used by public housing residents. The SP initiated the &quot;Hands Off Melbourne&#x27;s Estates&quot; (HOME) campaign with public housing residents, organising a rally on 24 March 2013 and meeting with the Trades Hall Building Industry Group to secure union support for the campaign. Shortly before the rally, the State Government announced its intention to back down from development on the Fitzroy and Richmond estates, where the campaign was most organised. They have yet to back down on plans for the Petty Horace estate in Prahran.

The Socialist Party has a history of involvement in the opposition to the East-West Tunnel, a proposed infrastructure project in Melbourne&#x27;s north that involves building a road tunnel ostensibly to ease congestion. The project has come under substantial criticism from many sources since its inception, and the government has been slow in releasing information on the full nature of the project. The Socialist Party holds the position that the tunnel &quot;is not about making the lives of ordinary people easier&quot; but is &quot;about serving the needs of the big transport companies&quot;, and they contend that it will not substantially ease traffic congestion, but will divert funds from public transport as well as causing damage to the areas through which the tunnel will be built. They instead support the expansion and improvement of public transport to improve service to Melbourne&#x27;s outer suburbs and to reduce congestion.

In early 2013 the Socialist Party initiated a pledge campaign to canvass support for community action against the construction of the tunnel, and a series of pickets were initiated in the Yarra area and Melbourne&#x27;s CBD. These were aimed at delaying and preventing test drilling for the tunnel project and at picketing the offices of Leighton Holdings subsidiaries John Holland (one of the reported contenders for the tunnel construction contract) and the Victorian Government&#x27;s Linking Melbourne Authority (LMA). This led to the LMA abandoning work on the final drill sites in October 2013, only to make another series of attempts from 16 December. Further community pickets successfully blocked work on the drill sites in subsequent days and the drilling was abandoned a second time. In March 2014, test drilling was restarted and abandoned a third time, leaving nine planned drill holes yet to be completed, four months behind the initial intended deadline. The picket campaign has received substantial media attention in Melbourne, with media outlets accused of demonising and misrepresenting the protestors.

Pressure from the tunnel&#x27;s opposition led to the ALP publicly reversing their position on the tunnel project ahead of the 2014 state elections, and the opposition to the tunnel was credited as a key factor in the November 2014 electoral defeat of the incumbent Liberal state government.

In early 2015, the Socialist Party initiated the No Room For Racism campaign. In Melbourne, they organised large counter-demonstrations of 3–4 thousand people against the newly formed right-wing group Reclaim Australia in April and July 2015. Following the dissolution of Reclaim Australia into separate organisations, the Richmond Town Hall became the target of an anti-Islamic rally held by the United Patriots Front due to the SP having an elected local councilor in Yarra, although the town hall building was empty during this rally and the party was holding a forum to develop the No Room For Racism campaign in the CBD at the time.

SP periodically raised money for various international fundraising appeals, in 2010 providing assistance after the Pakistan floods, in early 2012 providing assistance to Campaign Kazakhstan and in 2013 providing support towards the formation of the Workers and Socialist Party in South Africa.

==Policies==

SP campaigned for democratic socialism, opposing the bureaucratic &#x27;communist&#x27; dictatorships of countries such as China, North Korea, and Cuba. It followed in the Trotskyist tradition of internationalism. It approached collaboration with other left groups from a &#x27;united front&#x27; perspective, working alongside other groups while maintaining independent political views.

SP published a list of policy positions on the back page of each edition of its monthly magazine. SP had a democratic internal structure, in which all members voted on resolutions at an annual National Conference, which elected a National Committee to oversee the party between conferences. At branch meetings and national conferences, all members have full democratic rights of discussion, debate, and voting rights. SP operates on the organising principle of democratic centralism, interpreted as: &quot;the right of all members to discuss programme, policies, strategies and tactics inside the party, while agreeing to a united approach outside around the majority decision.&quot; SP kept the majority of its branch meetings open to the public.

===Attitude toward BDS campaign===

Unlike much of the Australian far-left, the SP did not endorse the tactic of a &quot;Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions&quot; campaign against Israel.

Instead, they supported a revolutionary socialist solution in the conflict, writing: &quot;A single state solution will be fought against to the death by the Israeli state, backed by their own working class. A capitalist two-state solution, as pushed by the likes of US and the EU, will be a Jewish dominated state with second-class rights and standards of living for the Palestinian masses. By far the best solution for working people and the poor in the region is a socialist two-state solution.&quot;

==Election of Socialist Party councillors==
In the past SP has had two local councillors in the City of Yarra. In November 2004 an SP member, Stephen Jolly, was elected to the City of Yarra. Jolly was elected to the Langridge Ward at the 2004 council elections with a first preference count of 12.34%. He was re-elected to Yarra council in 2008 with a first preference count of 29.18%, out-polling the Greens candidate in his ward (who received 26.29%) and the ALP (who received 16.12% in 2008, down from 28.14% in 2004). After the 2010 Victorian State election, the &quot;Melbourne Leader&quot; reported that the SP was likely to pick up a second seat from retiring ALP Mayor Jane Garrett who had been elected to the seat of Brunswick. The vacancy was filled by Anthony Main, who was elected into that seat on 23 January 2011.

In October 2012 the SP ran five candidates in three wards for the nine-seat council election. Stephen Jolly again outpolled all other candidates in his ward and across Yarra. As in 2008, he was re-elected on first preferences alone. The party increased his first preference vote to 34.34%. Anthony Main received 11.75% running in Melba ward, quintupling the Socialist Party&#x27;s vote in that ward and becoming the third highest first preference individual candidate there. He failed to win a seat after preferences were allocated. The Socialist Party received 36.56% (up from 29%) in Langridge Ward, 11.75% (up from 2%) in Melba Ward and 10.71% (up from 5%) in Nicholls ward for all their candidates. Their total vote across Yarra was 18.96% (up from 12.16%).

After the resignation of Stephen Jolly from the party in 2016, the Socialist Party no longer has any elected councillors.

===Council activity===

Socialist Party opposed each annual budget in the city of Yarra, being the only councillors that consistently voted against rate rises and neoliberal budget policies. They raised resolutions to make council activities more transparent, and published regular reports on Yarra Council meetings.

They opposed unpopular developments and campaigned to block developers from holding secret meetings with councillors. They opposed the use of parking waivers in areas with limited street parking available, and lobbied for a new indoor sports centre and the use of unused council buildings as hubs for local artists. Their policies included reversing the privatisation of rubbish collection, providing more childcare facilities, and the expansion and improvement of public housing. They intended to use council positions to oppose the sell-off of public housing land by the state government, and to bring the maintenance of public housing estates back under council control. They were known for providing representation for the residents of public housing estates in council chambers, including bringing media attention to issues such as inadequate maintenance and cockroach infestations, and they worked with residents to lobby council for improvements to sporting facilities at Atherton Gardens. Despite having an absolute minority on council (and being the only dissident votes on many issues), they managed to achieve some changes by mobilising ordinary residents outside of council chambers, such as securing funding for a public transport advocacy group, helping to revive the Brunswick Street Festival and saving the Loughnan Hall and Tudor Street community centres in Richmond.

<doc id="617323" wikidata="Q1741357" url="?curid=617323" title="Assassin (game)">
<text>Assassin (also Killer) is a live-action game in which players try to eliminate one another using mock weapons, in an effort to become the last surviving player.

Assassin is particularly popular on college campuses; several universities have a dedicated &quot;Assassins&#x27; Guild&quot; society, which organizes games for their members. Gameplay occurs at all hours and in all places unless otherwise disallowed by the rules. Since an elimination attempt could occur at any time, successful players are obliged to develop a degree of vigilance.

==Gameplay==
The Assassin game has several published variants, such as the Steve Jackson book &quot;&quot;, first published in 1982, and different guilds tend to create their own sets of rules and procedures. As such, the specific style of play is likely to vary between one group and the next.

===Rules===
Game hosts (also called umpires or referees) begin by advertising that a game is being set up and instruct potential players to send in their personal details. Once enough players have signed up, the game host assigns targets to the players. A player is usually told the personal details of their target as collected by the game host. The aim of the game is for players to track down and eliminate their targets until only one player remains. When a player eliminates their target, their victim’s target becomes their new target. Only one assassin can kill a target at a time. If only one player remains, the game is over.

Oxford University plays by a ruleset where the game runs for a week and the players respawn, usually after 12 hours; the aim of the game is to collect as many points from kills as possible. The respawn means events are organised during the game to capture specific points.

Eliminations (&quot;kills&quot;) remove a target from the game. What constitutes an elimination depends upon the particular rules set up by the game host. Eliminations might include hitting the target with a nerf gun or striking them with a toy plastic lightsaber.

Some rules establish safe-zones, also known as Out of Bounds. A safe-zone is a place that protects a player from elimination. Safe-zones are declared by game hosts. At a university, safe zones might include classrooms during class periods.

Under some rulesets, the presence of witnesses (or the presence of witnesses above a certain number) will either invalidate the kill or expose the killer to &quot;penalties&quot;, like additional assassins being dispatched to target them.

Game hosts might assign certain items to be worn or actions to be performed that protect the wearer or performer from elimination. These items or actions are called safeties. The safety can last for one specific day or for the duration of the game.

Some games have &quot;police forces&quot;, sometimes composed of eliminated players, whose job is to track down rule breakers. Some have time limits on eliminations and penalize players who are behind schedule in killing their targets.

Often, in games with a small number of players, the game hosts will designate one player as the &quot;assassin&quot; whose job it is to &quot;kill&quot; all other players without being identified. The assassin wins if they successfully kill all players without being identified and other players win by correctly guessing the assassin before they are killed. However, if a player guesses the wrong player, they are automatically eliminated. Those who are killed are not allowed to tell other players who the assassin is, but this variant is almost never played with a prize for winning to avoid accusations of cheating in this way.

==Methods of elimination==

Generally, elimination is carried out using items and methods that cause no actual damage and, in many cases, cannot be mistaken by bystanders or police for real weapons or acts of violence.

===Direct===
In a direct elimination, a player uses a fake weapon to touch their target.
The most common ranged weapons are water pistols, NERF-type weapons, and rubber band guns. Other weapons include tennis balls, balled-up socks, blue pens, or rubber bands fired by hand. Some rule sets simply make &quot;water&quot; a weapon, whether splashed with bare hands, conveyed by water balloon, or fired from a water gun. Basilisk rules count simply looking in the eyes of the target as a successful assassination. Some rule sets require photographic proof that a true sighting occurred.

Melee weapons are typically fake stabbing weapons. Melee weapons are more easily concealed than ranged weapons but require more stealth to employ effectively. Melee weapons must touch a player&#x27;s body to eliminate them. Common examples of melee weapons are cardboard and plastic knives, plastic lightsabers, spoons, pocket combs, and toothbrushes. Plastic spoons are commonly used to prevent injury from aggressive players. Sharpie markers can be used as melee weapons by marking on a player&#x27;s exposed skin.

There is a stickers-based variant that has been played a lot at conventions. It allows play in hotels or places which would upset other guests. The game tends to be very quick, often lasting less than 20 minutes. The stickers have words like dead, kill etc. on them. The people involved in the game wear stickers, saying such things as &quot;I am alive&quot;. They attempt to kill each other by sticking them to another player&#x27;s body. Pulling a sticker off its backing is considered &#x27;arming&#x27; which allows for accusation in killing circle based games.

===Indirect===

In an indirect elimination, a player plants an object where their target will be eliminated by it or changes their target&#x27;s environment in a specific way, as defined by the variant&#x27;s rules, that results in an elimination. Some variants allow &quot;poison&quot;, which can be implemented by adding strong flavors such as Tabasco sauce to the victim&#x27;s food or a piece of paper placed underneath the victim&#x27;s food with the word &quot;poison&quot; written on it. Another form is the use of a &quot;black spot&quot;. If a player opens a paper, sealed with tape, staples or any other of such, and there is a black spot inside, the player is eliminated.

Some variants allow &quot;bombs&quot;, which may be implemented in various ways. Some require the bomb to &quot;go off&quot; in some way and hence might use alarm clocks or other timers. One technique may be to &quot;e-bomb&quot; a target by either using an e-mail or instant messenger to send a file to a target in order to kill them. This attachment may be a word document, audio file, or an image that shows that the target is dead and the assassin that killed them. Another technique is the &quot;car bomb&quot;, where the assassin puts a tape or CD in the victim&#x27;s car audio system. When the victim starts the car and audio, they will hear the assassin saying that they were just &quot;car bombed&quot;. Another car-bomb variant allows one to shoot and kill the person while they are in the car by striking the car rather than the person inside, if using the Nerf Rocket Launcher or equivalent. An assassin may also bomb a victim by sending them a package in the mail with a dart or letter saying &quot;You&#x27;re Bombed.&quot; The victim is eliminated as soon as they open the package and read the note. In the sticker-based variants, applying a sticker to an object that the target then uses is considered to be a bomb attack.

Other weapons include venomous animals (usually a rubber spider, snake, or lizard placed within the victim&#x27;s backpack or book) and various manners of simulated traps. If an innocent manages to find a trap or animal before the intended victim, there is no penalty; it simply does not function. For example, if a friend finds a rubber snake in a victim&#x27;s backpack and reveals it to the victim, the victim does not die, but the killer is still in the game.

===Capture===

In a capture elimination, a player eliminates their target by coming into possession of a specific item. Capture eliminations are exactly like tackles in flag football. Some common objects used as capture objectives are flags, articles of clothing, and clothespins.

Winners typically receive a group-funded prize or are rewarded with a title.

==Themes==
Some games set up a back story to explain why the players are trying to kill each other. Players may act as members of a league of assassins or part of an attack of vampires. Whether a theme is used is dependent upon the preferences of the individual who hosts the game.

==Security fears==
On December 5, 1981, Mike Reagan, a California State University student, was shot by campus police officer Sgt. Stephen King after he observed Reagan and fellow game player Julia Gissel holding what looked like M16s. King observed the pair allegedly trying to open several doors. King approached, identified himself as a police officer, and ordered the pair to &quot;freeze&quot;. Gissel complied but Reagan turned and went into a shooting stance. King fired three times and critically injured Reagan. The M16s turned out to be wooden models that shot rubber bands and were being used in a version of Assassin.

In 2008, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln placed a one-year ban on the Assassin Game. The administrators of the school placed the ban after the police had been called by a person who observed one student bringing a Nerf gun to class.

Currently, the University of Texas at Dallas and Loyola University New Orleans can call disciplinary proceedings on a student who engages in a game of &quot;assassin, killer, or variations thereof.&quot;

On March 31, 2009, in Fife, Washington, a Costco, several car dealerships and small businesses were evacuated when a &quot;bomb&quot; was left by someone playing Assassin. Several local police and fire departments responded as well as the Explosives Disposal team from the Port of Seattle, the FBI and the BATF. The bomb was a box &quot;found in a flower bed, contained a magnet and a beeping motion sensor&quot; with the words &quot;bomb, you&#x27;re dead&quot; written on it. The &quot;bomb&quot; was defused. The man who left the package later turned himself in to authorities.

On May 12, 2009, an incident involving the Assassin game happened behind a North Hampton, New Hampshire, restaurant, where an employee spotted a man in dark clothing with a gun. He called the police, and the student in question did not resist but simply walked to his car and explained the game to the police. The man turned out to be a high school senior from Exeter, New Hampshire, waiting for another high school student to come out of her job at the restaurant with a water pistol in hand.

In 2016, an assassin game held in Oakville, Ontario led to residents on Calloway Drive and Gooseberry Way&#x27;s calling Halton Regional Police. The 3 participants wearing ski masks were subsequently released with warning.

In 2017, a group of high school students in Hopkinton, Massachusetts were playing Senior assassin with water guns when they thought they had entered an opponent&#x27;s garage but it turned out to be the house of a 70-year-old woman. The woman decided not to press charges.

<text>Kuala Kangsar (Perak Malay: ) is the royal town of Perak, Malaysia. It is located at the downstream of Kangsar River where it joins the Perak River, approximately northwest of Ipoh, Perak&#x27;s capital, and southeast of George Town, Penang. It is the main town in the administrative district of Kuala Kangsar, about 235 km from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The town is administered by the Kuala Kangsar Municipal Council (), formerly known as Kuala Kangsar District Council () from 1 January 1980 until 17 February 2004.

==History==
The site must have had a strange effect on Sultan Yusuf Sharifuddin Mudzaffar Shah of Perak who ruled from 1877 to 1887. Unlike many rulers who protected their royal palaces and strongholds by selecting their vantage points carefully where they could detect enemy approach from afar, the Sultan had his first royal palace built beside the riverbank. He then named it &#x27;Istana Sri Sayong&#x27;.

Apart from being exposed to the impending threat of invasion, the other problem was the force of monsoon seasons, which led to numerous flooding as water gushed down from the jungles above through the many tributaries. The name Kuala Kangsar is believed to be derived from &#x27;Kuala Kurang-Sa&#x27;, which literally means &#x27;100 minus (-) one&#x27;, usually interpreted as &#x27;the 99th small tributary to flow into the Perak River&#x27;.

One flooding was so severe, it almost swept the palace away. Finally, after the Big Flood or Air Bah in 1926, it was decided to move the place further up onto the knoll where stands the current Royal Palace named Istana Iskandariah with its Art-Deco architecture, a rare but significant piece of architectural milestone in Malaysia.

The Sultan of Perak officially resides in Kuala Kangsar, and it has been Perak&#x27;s royal seat since the 18th century. It is one of four towns that plays a role in Perak&#x27;s complex succession system. It was the administrative seat of the first British Resident in the Malay Peninsula, James W. W. Birch, from October 1874 until he was murdered on 2 November 1875. It was the capital of Perak until 1876.

Kuala Kangsar is also known in Malaysian history as the site where the first Conference of Rulers of the Federated Malay States, the Durbar, was held in 1897. By the 1890s, the growth of the tin mining towns of Ipoh and Taiping had eclipsed Kuala Kangsar, but it remains to this day one of the most attractive of the Malay royal capitals.

The town is also the site of the first rubber tree planted in Malaysia. The person responsible was the English botanist Henry Nicholas Ridley. He was the one who helped Malaya and eventually Malaysia become the largest rubber producer in the world. The tree still stands today.

The first Malaysian scout troop was established in Kuala Kangsar. Consequently, its squad number is 001.
