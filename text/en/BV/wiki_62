<text>The name Aphek or Aphec refers to one of several locations mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the scenes of a number of battles between the Israelites and the Arameans and Philistines:

*Most famously, a town near which one or more rulers of Damascus named Ben-hadad were defeated by the Israelites and in which the Damascene king and his surviving soldiers found a safe place of retreat (; ). Just before his death, the prophet Elisha predicted:
:&quot;The arrow of the Lord&#x27;s deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for you must strike the Syrians at Aphek till you have destroyed them ().

*A place at which the Bible states that the Philistines had encamped, while the Israelites pitched in Eben-Ezer, before the Battle of Aphek in which the sons of Eli were killed (I Samuel 4:1–ff.)
*A city of the Tribe of Issachar, near to Jezreel, in the north of the Sharon plain. The scene of another encampment of the Philistines, which led to the defeat and death of Saul.
*Aphik, a city of the tribe of Asher, identified as either Tel Afek near Haifa, or Afqa in Lebanon.

==Location==
===Golan or eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee===
After the turn of the 20th century the predominant opinion was that the location of all these battles is one and the same, and that the town lay east of the Jordan. Initially it was thought that the name is preserved in the now depopulated village of Fiq near Kibbutz Afik, three miles east of the Sea of Galilee, where an ancient mound, Tell Soreg, had been identified. Excavations by Moshe Kochavi and Pirhiya Beck in 1987–1988 have indeed discovered a fortified ninth- and eighth-century BCE settlement, probably Aramean, but Kochavi considered it to be too small to serve the role ascribed to Aphek in the Bible. The site most favoured now by the archaeologists is Tel &#x27;En Gev/Khirbet el-&#x27;Asheq, a mound located within Kibbutz Ein Gev.

A more recent theory has focused on regarding this same Aphek also as the scene of the two battles against the Philistines mentioned by the Bible - the supposition being that the Syrians were invading Israel from the western side, which was their most vulnerable.

===Judaean hills===
Since most scholars agree that there were more than one Aphek, C.R. Conder identified the Aphek of Eben-Ezer with a ruin (&quot;khirbet&quot;) some distant from Dayr Aban (believed to be Eben-Ezer), and known by the name &quot;Marj al-Fikiya&quot;; the name &quot;al-Fikiya&quot; being an Arabic corruption of Aphek. Eusebius, when writing about Eben-ezer in his &quot;Onomasticon&quot;, says that it is &quot;the place from which the Gentiles seized the Ark, between Jerusalem and Ascalon, near the village of Bethsamys (Beit Shemesh),&quot; a locale that corresponds with Conder&#x27;s identification.

<text>Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter is a 2001 Canadian horror parody superhero film from Odessa Filmworks which deals with Jesus Christ&#x27;s modern-day struggle to protect the lesbians of Ottawa, Ontario, from vampires with the help of Mexican wrestler and superhero El Santo. The film was written by Ian Driscoll and directed by Lee Demarbre.

&quot;Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter&quot; earned an honorable mention in the Spirit of Slamdance category at the 2002 Slamdance Film Festival.

== Plot summary ==
After a spree of vampire attacks on lesbians, Father Eustace (a Catholic priest) realizes that only Jesus Christ can fight off the vampires. Eustace sends two priests to a beach, where they inform Jesus of the problem. Three vampires, including Maxine Shreck, kill the priests, but Jesus kills two of the vampires by using the lake as holy water. Maxine escapes. Jesus goes to Ottawa, gets a haircut, and buys wood to make stakes.

Thirty atheists jump out of a car and confront Jesus, only to be easily defeated. Jesus teams up with Mary Magnum and infiltrates the hospital, where they discover that mad scientist Dr. Praetorious is performing skin-transplants to make the vampires immune to sunlight. Maxine and Johnny Golgotha defeat Jesus and Mary in a rooftop-battle. Thus Mary is bitten, becoming a vampire.

Jesus calls upon a Mexican wrestler, El Santo, for help. At a nightclub, they slay dozens of vampires, but El Santo and his assistant are captured. The next day, Johnny, Maxine, and Mary capture Jesus and bring him to a junkyard where his allies are being held. Eustace is there, and he reveals that he is a vampire. A battle breaks out. Jesus simultaneously fights Dr. Praetorious at the hospital. The doctor is fatally wounded, but Jesus heals him.

At the junkyard, Eustace stabs Jesus with a stake. A bright light emerges from the wound, killing Eustace and Johnny. El Santo shields a vampire whom he loves from the light, and Jesus cures her and Mary&#x27;s vampirism. To his surprise, Mary loves Maxine, so Jesus cures her too. Later, Jesus resumes preaching, asking people to think for themselves.

Ken Eisner of &quot;Variety&quot; took a more neutral view, finding that &quot;the film is too silly to offend&quot;. Jason Nolan of &quot;The Harrow&quot; deemed the production &quot;horridly wonderful&quot;, although uneven, noting that &quot;[w]ith a film like this, you want it to be bumpy&quot;. Film Threat&#x27;s Eric Campos gave the film a generally positive review.

<text>Feijoada (, ; from , &#x27;bean&#x27;) is the name for varieties of bean stew with beef and/or pork prepared in the Portuguese-speaking world.

&quot;Feijoada&quot; is a common name given to dishes from Portuguese-speaking countries such as Portugal, Brazil, Angola, East Timor, Mozambique, and Macau, where it is made from a mixture of meat and white, black, or red beans, usually accompanied by rice.

== History ==
Meat (pork) stew with vegetables can be traced to ancient Roman cuisine. The dish spread with the Roman Empire and gave rise to dishes such as the French cassoulet, the Milanese cassoeula, the Romanian fasole cu cârnați, the fabada asturiana from Northwestern Spain, the Spanish cocido madrileño and olla podrida, and the feijoada of Minho Province in Northern Portugal.

The creation and name of &quot;feijoada&quot; are related to Portuguese ways of making it, from the regions of Estremadura, Beiras, Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, which mix various types of beans - except black beans (of American origin) - sausages, ears and pigs&#x27; feet.

The Portuguese version of &quot;feijoada&quot; originates mainly in the north of the country, where it is cooked with white beans in the northwest (Minho and Douro) or red beans in the northeast (Trás-os-Montes), and usually also includes other vegetables (tomatoes, carrots or kale) along with pork or beef, to which chorizo, blood sausage or &quot;farinheira&quot; can be added.

<text>Robert Westerholt (born 2 January 1975) is a Dutch musician, known as the guitarist and co-founder of the symphonic metal band Within Temptation. He writes music for the band, which is fronted by his partner and band vocalist Sharon den Adel. Westerholt used to work in human resource management before his career with Within Temptation.

== Work prior to Within Temptation ==
Westerholt was born in Waddinxveen, South Holland, Netherlands. In 1992, Westerholt formed the band &quot;The Circle&quot; with future Within Temptation keyboard player Martijn Spierenburg, and he began writing his own music. The Circle&#x27;s first demo, entitled &#x27;Symphony No.1&#x27; was finished in December 1992. At this point, The Circle had a complete line-up, composed of Westerholt, Martijn, Jeroen van Veen (Within Temptation&#x27;s bassist), Arjan Groenedijk and Ernst van der Loo, although Arjan and Ernst both left the band a while later. In a 1995 compilation album released by DSFA Records, two songs, &quot;Broken Silence&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot; by The Circle, were featured. Soon afterward, Westerholt left The Circle, and the band was renamed as Voyage. Voyage released their only album &#x27;Embrace&#x27; in 1995, in which Sharon den Adel collaborated on the track &quot;Frozen&quot;.

== Within Temptation ==
After leaving The Circle, Westerholt began writing more music for a new musical project with his girlfriend, Sharon den Adel. Westerholt sent demo versions of their songs &#x27;Enter&#x27; and &#x27;Candles&#x27; to former Voyage bandmate Jeroen van Veen, who then left Voyage to join Westerholt&#x27;s project, along with Michiel Papenhove. Their first drummer was Richard Willemse, who left and was replaced with Dennis Leeflang, with whom Within Temptation recorded their first demo. He left soon afterward and was replaced with Ivar de Graaf. Westerholt recalls that &quot;we always had a little bit of a drummer problem, leaving and coming back again...&quot;. By 1997, their line-up had been completed, with Sharon (vocals), Westerholt (guitars and vocals), Westerholt&#x27;s brother Martijn (keyboards), Jeroen (bass), Michiel (guitar) and Ivar (drums).
In the same year, Within Temptation were signed to DSFA Records and released their debut album, Enter.

As of 2011, Westerholt has stepped down from touring with Within Temptation in order to take care of his and Den Adel&#x27;s children. He is still a recording band member, however, and will focus on songwriting and production. Stefan Helleblad, who has been working behind the scenes with the band, is his live stand-in.

== Other appearances ==
In 1998, he had a small singing part as Death (along with George Oosthoek of Orphanage) on the Ayreon rock opera &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;, on which Sharon den Adel played one of the main characters.

== Personal life ==
Westerholt and Sharon den Adel became parents to Eva Luna on 7 December 2005 and Robin Aiden on 1 June 2009. The birth of their son, Logan Arwin, was announced on 31 March 2011.
Westerholt and den Adel eventually married in 2018.

<text>Computer-mediated reality refers to the ability to add to, subtract information from, or otherwise manipulate one&#x27;s perception of reality through the use of a wearable computer or hand-held device such as a smartphone.

Mediated reality is a proper superset of mixed reality, augmented reality, and virtual reality, as it also includes, for example, diminished reality.

Typically, it is the user&#x27;s &quot;visual&quot; perception of the environment that is mediated. This is done through the use of some kind of electronic device, such as an EyeTap device or smart phone, which can act as a visual filter between the real world and what the user perceives. Computer-mediated reality has been used to enhance visual perception as an aid to the visually impaired. This example achieves a mediated reality by altering a video input stream light that would have normally reached the user&#x27;s eyes, and computationally altering it to filter it into a more useful form. It has also been used for interactive computer interfaces.

The use of computer-mediated reality to &quot;diminish&quot; perception, by the removal or masking of visual data, has been used for architectural applications, and is an area of ongoing research.

The long-term effects of altering perceived reality have not been thoroughly studied, and negative side effects of long-term exposure might be possible. Short term effects have been demonstrated with the eyestrain caused by computers.

==As a seeing aid==
In the 1970s and 1980s, Steve Mann introduced the Generation-1 and Generation-2 &quot;Digital Eye Glass&quot;, initially as a vision aid to help people see better, as a welding helmet, and as a general-purpose seeing aid for everyday life as outlined in IEEE Technology &amp; Society 31(3) and the supplemental material entitled &quot;GlassEyes&quot;.

In this sense, mediated reality is a proper superset of mixed reality, augmented reality, and virtual reality, as it also includes, for example, diminished reality.

==Window managers==
One common window manager in mediated reality is the &quot;Reality Window Manager&quot;.

==Wireless mediated reality==
With wireless communications, mediated reality can also become a communications medium among different communities. For example, Bluetooth devices are often used with mediated reality. With the use of EyeTap, such interaction is called &quot;seeing eye-to-eye&quot;.

==Applications==

Applications of mediated reality include devices that help people see better, as well as devices for gaming and equipment repair, telemedicine, remote expert advice interfaces, and wayfinding. Mediated reality is also used in robotics and drawing applications such as the &quot;Loose and Sketchy&quot; drawing package.

One key application of computer-mediated reality is healthcare and medicine, which has become a popular research area, specifically beginning in the 1990s with the field growing larger over time. Common research topics include applications of computer-mediated reality in surgery, diagnosing diseases generally, and aiding care of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson&#x27;s. In surgery, studies have shown that the use of virtual reality simulations can be used to reduce error, improve efficiency, and be used generally as training. Other applications in surgery include modeling, which allows for more extensive planning of surgeries prior to the procedure that can also be more personalized to the patient, and image-guided surgery, in which machines and overlays would allow for more accuracy in the surgical processes. There have even been complete telesurgeries, where the surgeon operates on a 3D model of the patient while a robot executes the actions. This has been used for basic surgeries on swine and more advanced surgeries on swine and humans. With neurodegenerative diseases, virtual reality has been used to simulate situations that train memory but aren&#x27;t reproduce in a standard treatment environment. Virtual reality may also be used for interfacing with a patient in their home, with data sent directly to the physician, or creating games that would encourage these exercises. Virtual reality has also been used to aid those with a fear of heights, anxiety, depression, and autism. It has also been used to reduce patients&#x27; pain.

A widely implemented development of computer-mediated reality in medicine is the invention of electronic consultation, such as services like Teladoc.

Within video games, the most common form of computer-mediated reality is virtual reality headsets, such as Oculus Rift. These are devices that attach to the user&#x27;s head and immerse their field of vision solely within the game world. Controllers used for virtual reality games range from traditionally designed controllers to controllers designed to track the motions of the user. However, alongside the uses previously mention in medical fields, virtual reality has gained notoriety with Meta, formerly known as Facebook, and the introduction of their &quot;metaverse.&quot; The metaverse is intended to be designed in a similar fashion to massive multiplayer online games, where users can interact with each other in an interconnected virtual space. It has already been subject to controversy, as a woman claimed she was assaulted in the Metaverse. In addition to virtual reality, augmented reality has also been used for video games. The most prominent example is &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, an augmented reality game for mobile devices where Pokémon creatures are displayed through the phone to appear as if they are part of the real world. Other examples of AR games include &quot;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&quot; and &quot;Ingress&quot;, which was developed by the same developer behind &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;.

Augmented reality technology has similarly been applied with social media applications such as Snapchat. These lenses range from adding 3D digital objects to pictures to altering the appearance of those in the photos. One of the most common types are beauty filters, which digitally alter the user&#x27;s appearance to make the user appear more &quot;beautiful.&quot; Beauty filters have been correlated to lower self esteem.

<doc id="623600" wikidata="Q589595" url="?curid=623600" title="Mike the Headless Chicken">
<text>Mike the Headless Chicken (April 20, 1945March 17, 1947) was a male Wyandotte chicken that lived for 18 months after he was beheaded, surviving because most of his brain stem remained intact and it did not bleed to death due to a blood clot. After the beheading, Mike achieved national fame until his death in March 1947. In Fruita, Colorado, United States, an annual &quot;Mike the Headless Chicken Day&quot; is held in May. Mike has the record for the longest surviving chicken without a head on Guinness World Records.

==Beheading==
On September 10, 1945, farmer Lloyd Olsen of Fruita, Colorado, United States, was planning to eat supper with his mother-in-law and was sent out to the yard by his wife to bring back a chicken. Olsen chose a five-and-a-half-month-old Wyandotte chicken named Mike. The axe removed the bulk of the head, but missed the jugular vein, leaving one ear and most of the brain stem intact.

Despite Olsen&#x27;s attempt to behead Mike, the chicken could still balance on a perch and walk clumsily. It attempted to preen, peck for food, and crow, though with limited success; his &quot;crowing&quot; consisted of a gurgling sound made in his throat. When Mike did not die, Olsen decided to care for the bird. He fed it a mixture of milk and water via an eyedropper and gave it small grains of corn and worms.

==Fame==
Once his fame had been established, Mike began a career of touring sideshows in the company of such other anomalies as a two-headed baby. It was also photographed for dozens of magazines and papers, and was featured in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines. Mike was put on display to the public for an admission cost of 25 cents (). At the height of his popularity, the chicken&#x27;s owner earned $4,500 per month (); Mike was valued at $10,000 ().

==Death==
In March 1947, at a motel in Phoenix, Arizona on a stopover while traveling back from tour, Mike started choking on his mucus in the middle of the night. The Olsens had inadvertently left their feeding and cleaning syringes at the sideshow the day before, and so were unable to save Mike. Olsen claimed that he had sold the bird off, resulting in stories of Mike still touring the country as late as 1949. Other sources say that the chicken&#x27;s severed trachea could not properly take in enough air to be able to breathe, and he therefore choked to death in the motel.

==Explanation of the case==
It was determined that the axe had missed the jugular vein and a clot had prevented Mike from bleeding to death. Although most of his head was severed, most of his brain stem and one ear were left on his body. Since basic functions (breathing, heart rate, etc.) as well as most of a chicken&#x27;s reflex actions are controlled by the brain stem, Mike was able to remain quite healthy. This is a good example of central motor generators enabling basic homeostatic functions to be carried out in the absence of higher brain centres. In addition, birds possess a secondary balance organ in the pelvic region, the lumbosacral organ, which controls walking locomotion virtually independently from the vestibular organ involved in flight. This has been used to explain how a headless chicken can walk and balance, despite the destruction of much of the cranial vestibular system.

==Legacy==
Mike the Headless Chicken is a cultural institution in Fruita, Colorado, with an annual &quot;Mike the Headless Chicken Day&quot;, the third weekend of May since 1999. Events held include the &quot;5K Run Like a Headless Chicken Race&quot;, egg toss, &quot;Pin the Head on the Chicken&quot;, the &quot;Chicken Cluck-Off&quot;, and &quot;Chicken Bingo&quot;, in which chicken droppings on a numbered grid choose the numbers.

Mike the Headless Chicken was an inspiration for the poultry-themed comedy punk band The Radioactive Chicken Heads, serving as the subject of their 2008 song &quot;Headless Mike&quot;, for which a music video was filmed. The band also features a Headless Mike puppet which is frequently used in their live shows.

<doc id="623607" wikidata="Q391038" url="?curid=623607" title="Šamaš-šuma-ukin">
<text>Šamaš-šuma-ukin ( or , meaning &quot;Shamash has established the name&quot;), was king of Babylon as a vassal of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 668 BC to his death in 648. Born into the Assyrian royal family, Šamaš-šuma-ukin was the son of the Neo-Assyrian king Esarhaddon and the elder brother of Esarhaddon&#x27;s successor Ashurbanipal.

Despite being the elder son, Šamaš-šuma-ukin was for unknown reasons bypassed as heir to Assyria. His designation as heir to Babylonia was likely devised by Esarhaddon as a means to counteract future rivalry and jealousy between the brothers. Although Esarhaddon specified that Šamaš-šuma-ukin was to swear an oath of allegiance to Ashurbanipal, the clear primary heir, Šamaš-šuma-ukin was also referred to as Ashurbanipal&#x27;s &quot;equal brother&quot; and Ashurbanipal was to stay out of his affairs. This part of the succession plans were not upheld by Ashurbanipal after Esarhaddon&#x27;s death; Šamaš-šuma-ukin only acceded to the Babylonian throne months after Ashubanipal had become king and was throughout his reign a closely monitored vassal, not entrusted with all of Babylonia or substantial military forces and only allowed to make decisions if they were approved and verified by Ashurbanipal. 

Šamaš-šuma-ukin assimilated well into Babylonia, despite being ethnically and culturally Assyrian. His royal inscriptions are far more &quot;quintessentially Babylonian&quot; than those of other Assyrian rulers of southern Mesopotamia, using Babylonian imagery and rhetoric to an unprecedented extent. He participated in the Babylonian New Year&#x27;s festival and is recorded as partaking in other Babylonian traditions. The Statue of Marduk, the main cult image of Babylon&#x27;s patron deity Marduk, was returned to Babylon in 668 at Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s coronation, having been stolen from the city by his grandfather Sennacherib twenty years prior.

Though Šamaš-šuma-ukin maintained peaceful relations with his younger brother for many years, resentment gradually grew between them due to Ashurbanipal&#x27;s overbearing control. In 652, Šamaš-šuma-ukin revolted, inspiring the Babylonians to join him and recruiting a coalition of enemies of Assyria, including the Elamites, Chaldeans, Arameans and perhaps the Medes. Though the conflict was initially indecisive, it eventually ended in disaster for Šamaš-šuma-ukin. Babylon was captured by Ashurbanipal in 648 after a lengthy siege and Šamaš-šuma-ukin died, though the exact circumstances of his death are unclear. After his defeat and death there is evidence of a large-scale &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; campaign, with images of the king being mutilated, erasing his face.

== Background ==

Šamaš-šuma-ukin was probably the second eldest son of Esarhaddon, the third king of the Sargonid dynasty, younger only than the crown prince Sin-nadin-apli. Upon the unexpected death of Sin-nadin-apli in 674 BC, the Assyrian court was thrown into upheaval. Esarhaddon had only become king through great difficulty and wished to avoid his own eventual death initiating a succession crisis. He thus soon began to draw up new succession plans. Esarhaddon decided that the fourth-eldest son Ashurbanipal would inherit Assyria, clearly the primary title. Šamaš-šuma-ukin, the next-eldest son after Sin-nadin-apli, was instead designated as the heir to Babylonia, with the two designated as &quot;equal brothers&quot;. The third eldest son Šamaš-metu-uballiṭ was entirely bypassed, perhaps because he suffered from poor health. Despite proclaiming his two sons as equals, Esarhaddon also made it clear that Šamaš-šuma-ukin was to swear an oath of allegiance to Ashurbanipal.

After Esarhaddon made his decision, the two princes arrived at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh together and partook in a celebration in May 672 with foreign representatives, Assyrian nobles and elements of the military. Promoting one son as heir to Assyria and the other as heir to Babylonia was a novel idea; for the past decades the Assyrian king had simultaneously ruled Babylonia. The decision to bypass Šamaš-šuma-ukin as heir to Assyria was also a remarkable one, given that Esarhaddon&#x27;s own accession issues had been the direct result of his father Sennacherib acting in a similar way. Sennacherib had bypassed the elder son Arda-Mulissu in favor of the younger Esarhaddon; in Sennacherib&#x27;s case this decision led to Arda-Mulissu murdering him and fighting a civil war against Esarhaddon. Why Esarhaddon made nearly the same decision is not clear.

One hypothesis in regard to why a younger son was designated as the heir to what was clearly Esarhaddon&#x27;s primary title is that Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šuma-ukin could have had different mothers. Though it is equally likely that Šamaš-šuma-ukin and Ashurbanipal shared a mother, possibly Ešarra-ḫammat (Esarhaddon&#x27;s primary consort), it is also possible that Ashurbanipal was the son of an Assyrian woman and Šamaš-šuma-ukin was the son of a Babylonian woman; Šamaš-šuma-ukin accceding to the Assyrian throne could thus have been problematic. The decision to grant Šamaš-šuma-ukin Babylonia and designate him and Ashurbanipal as &quot;equal brothers&quot; could perhaps be due to Esarhaddon wishing to avoid the rivalry and jealousy involved in his own accession. If Šamaš-šuma-ukin had Babylonian heritage, Esarhaddon could have surmised that he was a superior candidate for the Babylonian throne.

As crown prince, Šamaš-šuma-ukin would have undergone training for traditional royal duties, such as hunting, riding, scholarship and wisdom, archery, chariotry and other forms of military training. Because Esarhaddon was constantly ill, much of the administrative duties of the empire fell upon Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šuma-ukin during the last few years of their father&#x27;s reign. It was important for the crown princes to gain real experience in ruling. Letters of correspondence between Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal from this time for instance show that Ashurbanipal prominently participated in the Assyrian intelligence network, gathering information on foreign enemies and rivals and compiling reports for his father.

Ashurbanipal immediately became king of Assyria upon Esarhaddon&#x27;s death. Šamaš-šuma-ukin was somewhat belatedly crowned as king of Babylon in the spring of the next year. His coronation was marked by Ashurbanipal returning the religiously important Statue of Marduk, stolen by Sennacherib twenty years prior, to Babylon. The return of the statue was particularly important as it in the eyes of the Babylonians cemented the approval of Marduk, the Babylonian national deity, of the new king&#x27;s rule. Though Šamaš-šuma-ukin, an Assyrian prince, being installed as the king of Babylon was in a way an embodiment of Assyrian hegemony, his coronation ceremony (parallelling that of Ashurbanipal) and the return of the Statue of Marduk were efforts made to portray him as an independent king of Babylon. Šamaš-šuma-ukin would rule at Babylon for sixteen years, apparently mostly peacefully in regard to his younger brother, but there would be repeated disagreements on the exact extent of his control; despite the requirement of an oath of allegiance to Ashurbanipal, Esarhaddon had also specified that Ashurbanipal was not to interfere in Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s affairs. This part of the succession plans were not upheld by Ashurbanipal, who perhaps shifted the balanace of power in his own favor and diminished Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s intended status out of fear that his elder brother given a strong power-base would threaten his rule.

== Reign ==

=== Early reign and status ===

Šamaš-šuma-ukin was the only member of the Assyrian royal family to accede to the Babylonian throne and intentionally never to the Assyrian one. The only other Assyrian prince who ruled Babylon and not Assyria was Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s uncle Ashur-nadin-shumi, though he had been the crown prince of Sennacherib and the intended successor in Assyria as well. Though Ashurbanipal, as king of Assyria, was more powerful, Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s kingship of Babylon, important to the Assyrians for military, political, religious and ideological reasons, was prestigious in its own right. He was however very clearly a closely monitored vassal rather than an autonomous ruler. Though Esarhaddon&#x27;s inscriptions suggest that Šamaš-šuma-ukin should have been granted the entirety of Babylonia to rule, contemporary records only definitely prove that Šamaš-šuma-ukin held Babylon itself and its vicinity. The governors of some Babylonian cities, such as Nippur, Uruk and Ur, and the rulers in the Sea Land, all ignored the existence of a king in Babylon and saw Ashurbanipal as their monarch. Šamaš-šuma-ukin was also not entrusted with any substantial military forces; when the Elamite king Teumman invaded Babylonia in 653, Šamaš-šuma-ukin was unable to defend his country and had to rely on Ashurbanipal for military support.

Šamaš-šuma-ukin is recorded as having participated in several traditional Babylonian royal activities. He rebuilt the walls of the city Sippar and is known to have participated in the Babylonian New Year&#x27;s festival, which had been suspended during the time that the god&#x27;s statue was absent from the city. He gave considerable attention to the temples of his domain, confirming offerings in several temples in his inscriptions and increasing the land of the Ishtar temple in Uruk. Šamaš-šuma-ukin was ethnically and culturally Assyrian, but appears to have assimilated well into Babylonia. His royal inscriptions are far more &quot;quintessentially Babylonian&quot; than those of other Assyrian rulers of southern Mesopotamia, using Babylonian imagery and rhetoric to an unprecedented extent, almost as if overriding his actual cultural and ethnic origin as an Assyrian. Though he was in Assyria at some points, such on one occasion when he was feeling sick, Šamaš-šuma-ukin was presumably the first of his dynasty to live in Babylon full-time. Throughout his reign, Šamaš-šuma-ukin partook in several building projects, an important aspect of Babylonian kingship to the same degree as military campaigns were important in Assyrian kingship. He is recorded as restoring shrines in several cities and as rebuilding the city wall of Sippar.

Despite his kingship having been designated by Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal refers to himself in his inscriptions as the man who granted Šamaš-šuma-ukin rule over Babylon. This is possibly due to Šamaš-šuma-ukin only being formally crowned as king a few months after Ashurbanipal had become the Assyrian monarch. It would also theoretically have been within Ashurbanipal&#x27;s power to stop Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s coronation.

=== Worsening relations ===

The exact reasons for Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s revolt against Ashurbanipal are unknown, but there are several possibilities. Perhaps the most commonly believed reason is that although Esarhaddon had designated Šamaš-šuma-ukin to inherit control of all of Babylonia, this had not been respected by Ashurbanipal once Esarhaddon was dead. Although business documents from Šamaš-šuma-ukin are known throughout Babylonia (suggesting that most of the region saw him as their king), similar documents dated to the reign of Ashurbanipal are also known from Babylonia, which suggests that Ashurbanipal had assumed the authority of a Babylonian monarch despite there already being a king in Babylon.

The cities Babylon, Dilbat, Borsippa and Sippar all lack business documents from Ashurbanipal, suggesting that these cities were firmly under Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s rule, but Ashurbanipal had agents throughout the south that reported directly to him (not to Šamaš-šuma-ukin) and inscriptions suggest that any orders Šamaš-šuma-ukin gave to his subjects first had to be verified and approved by Ashurbanipal before they could be carried out. Ashurbanipal had a permanent garrison of troops and officials stationed at Borsippa, a city which would have been deep inside Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s domain. There are also preserved petitions sent by officials in Babylon directly to Ashurbanipal. Had Šamaš-šuma-ukin been the universally respected sovereign of Babylon, he would probably have been the receiver of such letters.

Royal records from Babylonia during the time of peaceful coexistence between Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šuma-ukin mention the names of both monarchs, but contemporary documents from Assyria only mention Ashurbanipal, reinforcing that the two kings were not equal in status. Kudurru, who was the governor of Uruk, addressed Ashurbanipal in his letters with the title &quot;king of the Lands&quot;, despite Uruk being located in Babylonia, indicating that Kudurru saw Ashurbanipal, and not Šamaš-šuma-ukin, as his overlord. Šamaš-šuma-ukin himself seems to have seen himself as Ashurbanipal&#x27;s equal, simply addressing him as &quot;my brother&quot; in his letters (unlike how he addressed his father Esarhaddon, &quot;the king, my father&quot;). Although there are several letters preserved from Šamaš-šuma-ukin to Ashurbanipal, there are no known replies preserved. It is possible that Ashurbanipal, on account of his network of informers, did not feel a need to write to his brother.

By the 650s, the relations between Šamaš-šuma-ukin and Ashurbanipal had worsened considerably. A letter from Zakir, a courtier at Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s court, to Ashurbanipal described how visitors from the Sea Land had publicly criticized Ashurbanipal in front of Šamaš-šuma-ukin, using the phrase &quot;this is not the word of a king!&quot;. Zakir reported that though Šamaš-šuma-ukin was angered, he and his governor of Babylon, Ubaru, chose to not take action against the visitors. Perhaps the most important factors behind Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s revolt was his dissatisfaction with his position relative to that of his brother, the constant resentment of Assyria in general by the Babylonians and the constant willingness of the ruler of Elam to join anyone who waged war against Assyria.

=== Revolt against Ashurbanipal ===

Aspiring to become independent of Ashurbanipal and free Babylonia under his own rule, Šamaš-šuma-ukin revolted in 652.&#x27; According to later Aramaic-language legends, Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s sister Šērūʾa-ēṭirat attempted to intervene and stop the two from fighting; after the war broke out the legends hold that she disappeared into self-imposed exile.&quot;&quot;&#x27; The war between the brothers lasted for three years. The rebellion was not an attempt to claim the Assyrian throne, but rather an attempt at securing the independence of Babylonia. Inscription evidence suggests that Šamaš-šuma-ukin addressed the citizens of Babylon to join him in his revolt. In Ashurbanipal&#x27;s inscriptions, Šamaš-šuma-ukin is quoted to have said &quot;Ashurbanipal will cover with shame the name of the Babylonians&quot;, which Ashurbanipal refers to as &quot;wind&quot; and &quot;lies&quot;. Soon after Šamaš-šuma-ukin began his revolt, the rest of southern Mesopotamia rose up against Ashurbanipal alongside him. Early in the war, Ashurbanipal tried to get various local governors in the south to join his side instead, writing to them in hopes that some of them might be interested in de-escalating the war. In these letters, Ashurbanipal never refers to Šamaš-šuma-ukin by name, instead calling him &quot;lā aḫu&quot; (&quot;no-brother&quot;). In many inscriptions, Šamaš-šuma-ukin is simply identified as the &quot;unfaithful brother&quot;, &quot;enemy brother&quot; or just &quot;the enemy&quot;. In some of the letters Ashurbanipal referred to him as &quot;this man whom Marduk hates&quot; in an effort to undermine his legitimacy as a Babylonian king.

According to the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, Šamaš-šuma-ukin was very successful in finding allies. Ashurbanipal identified three groups who aided his brother: first and foremost there were the Chaldeans, Arameans and the other peoples of Babylonia, then there were the Elamites, and lastly the kings of Gutium, Amurru and Meluhha. This last group of kings might refer to the Medes (as Gutium, Amurru and Meluhha no longer existed at this point) but this is uncertain. Meluhha might have referred to Egypt, though the Egyptians are not documented to have aided Šamaš-šuma-ukin in the war. Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s ambassadors to the Elamites had offered gifts (called &quot;bribes&quot; by Ashurbanipal) and their king, Ummanigash, sent an army under the command of Undashe, the son of Teumman, to aid in the conflict. 

For the first two years of the conflict, battles were fought all across Babylonia, some won by the Assyrians and some won by Šamaš-šuma-ukin and his allies. The war quickly turned chaotic; several minor players repeatedly changed sides and both Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šuma-ukin found it difficult to keep track of their allies. Among the most notorious double agents were Nabu-bel-shumati, a governor of the far south in Babylonia whose repeated betrayals enraged Ashurbanipal.

=== Siege of Babylon and death ===
Despite the coalition of Assyrian enemies he had assembled, Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s revolt was unsuccessful. The coalition failed to halt Ashurbanipal&#x27;s advance and Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s forces, allies and lands were gradually lost. The Elamites, his primary ally, were defeated near Der and ceased to play a role in the conflict. By 650 Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s situation looked grim, with Ashubanipal&#x27;s forces having besieged Sippar, Borsippa, Kutha and Babylon itself.&#x27; During the siege of Babylon, the city entered into a period of famine. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s account of the siege claimed that some of the citizens grew so hungry and desperate that they ate their own children. After enduring the siege for two years, Babylon finally fell in 648 and was plundered by the Assyrian army.&#x27; Ashurbanipal initiated a bloodbath in the city, described in detail in his later inscriptions: &quot;their carved up bodies I fed to dogs, to pigs, to wolves, to eagles, to birds of the heavens, to fishes of the deep&quot;. One of Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s recorded prayers records his despair in the final stages of the war:

At the time Babylon fell to Ashurbanipal, a great fire spread within the city. Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s fate is not entirely clear. He is traditionally believed by historians to have committed suicide by setting himself on fire in his palace,&#x27; but contemporary texts only say that he &quot;met a cruel death&quot; and that the gods &quot;consigned him to a fire and destroyed his life&quot;. In addition to suicide through self-immolation or other means, it is possible that Šamaš-šuma-ukin was executed, died accidentally or was killed in some other way. Most of the accounts of his death state that it involved fire in some capacity, but do not give more elaborate details. The gods are typically identified as playing a part (perhaps burning him away with fire themselves) due to Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s war against Ashurbanipal also being framed by Ashurbanipal as impious. If Šamaš-šuma-ukin was executed, it would be logical for the Assyrian scribes to leave this out of historical records since fratricide (killing a brother) was illegal and even if a soldier (and not Ashurbanipal) had carried it out, it would still constitute a murder of a member of the Assyrian royal family. Had a soldier killed Šamaš-šuma-ukin, he might very well have been executed himself. After Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s death, Ashubanipal placed one of his officials, Kandalanu, on the Babylonian throne as his vassal.&#x27;

== Legacy ==
Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s rebellion and downfall represented a difficult case for the Assyrian royal scribes who recorded history. As Šamaš-šuma-ukin was both a member of the Assyrian royal family and a traitorous Babylonian king, it was difficult to write of his fate; while scribes eagerly recorded lengthy accounts of the defeat of foreign kings and rebels, there was a general reluctance to write about the death of members of the Assyrian royal family. Matters might have been complicated further by the fact that unlike many other rebels faced by the Assyrians, Šamaš-šuma-ukin was not a usurper, but the legitimately installed ruler of Babylon, by decree of an Assyrian king.

Ashurbanipal&#x27;s personal inscriptions offer little in regards to the end of Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s life and Assyrian kings after Ashurbanipal do not mention him at all, almost as if he had never existed in the first place. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s inscriptions talk around his brother&#x27;s death and in many places even omit Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s name, simply calling him &quot;the king&quot;. In a relief from Ashurbanipal&#x27;s palace at Nineveh, depicting his victory over the Babylonian revolt, soldiers are depicted as giving the Babylonian crown and the Babylonian royal insignia to him, but Šamaš-šuma-ukin is conspicuously absent. There is evidence of a considerable &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; following Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s downfall, with steles erected by the king being purposefully mutilated after his death, erasing his face.

== Titulature ==
Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s most frequently used title was &quot;šar Bābili&quot; (&quot;king of Babylon&quot;), though there exists a single inscription where he used &quot;šakkanakki Bābili&quot; (&quot;viceroy of Babylon&quot;) instead. In the inscriptions of other Assyrian kings who ruled the city, &quot;viceroy&quot; is typically more common than &quot;king&quot;. He also assumed other traditional Babylonian royal titles, such as &quot;šar māt Šumeri u Akkadi&quot; (&quot;king of Sumer and Akkad&quot;). Overall, his titulary was quintessentially Babylonian to a much higher degree than other Assyrian rulers of the city. As typically done by Assyrian rulers, Šamaš-šuma-ukin venerated his ancestors in many of his inscriptions, typically naming his great-grandfather Sargon II, his grandfather Sennacherib (from whom he typically omitted the title &quot;king of Babylon&quot; due to Sennacherib&#x27;s actions against the city), his father Esarhaddon and sometimes his brother Ashurbanipal. Their inclusion in his titles may be because Šamaš-šuma-ukin feared that his legitimacy could be questioned if they were omitted. The specific way his ancestors were presented, and Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s use of deities in his inscriptions, set him apart from other Assyrian rulers.

Significantly, Šamaš-šuma-ukin left out any mentions of the role of his royal ancestors as chief priests of Assyria&#x27;s god Ashur, a concept intrinsically linked to Assyrian ideas of kingship. As expected for a ruler of Babylon, the deity most frequently referenced in Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s royal inscriptions is Marduk, but Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s inscriptions do not contain a single mention of Ashur, who was otherwise included (though sometimes in a reduced capacity) in the inscriptions of those of his ancestors who ruled both Assyria and Babylonia. Despite Šamaš-šuma-ukin publicly identifying himself as an Assyrian (through his genealogy), his inscriptions thus suggest that he did not venerate Assyria&#x27;s national deity. In many places in his titles, Šamaš-šuma-ukin appropriated Assyrian titular conventions in regards to how deities were used but substituted the important gods in Assyria, such as Ashur, Ishtar and Sîn, for deities more venerated in the south, such as Marduk and Sarpanit.

<doc id="623615" wikidata="Q587416" url="?curid=623615" title="Masayuki Uemura">
<text>was a Japanese engineer, video game producer, and professor. He was known for his work as an employee of Nintendo from 1971 to 2004, most notably for serving as a key factor in the development of the Nintendo Entertainment System. 

A former employee of Sharp Corporation, Uemura joined Nintendo in 1971 working with Gunpei Yokoi and Genyo Takeda on solar cell technology for the Laser Clay Shooting System arcade game. After becoming General Manager of Nintendo R&amp;D2, Uemura served as the lead architect for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES game consoles. He retired from Nintendo in 2004 and became director for the Center for Game Studies at Ritsumeikan University.

== Education ==
Uemura graduated from the Chiba Institute of Technology with a degree in electronic engineering. He wrote in his autobiography that he very much enjoyed his learning years.

==Career==
Uemura originally worked at Sharp Corporation after graduating from college, selling solar cell batteries. He sold photocell technology to several companies, including Nintendo, who used it for a light gun product, called a &quot;ray gun&quot;. Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo&#x27;s main toy designer at the time, discussed with him the possibility of using Sharp&#x27;s solar cells on interesting products, using their light-detecting capabilities for a shooting game. Thus, they, alongside Genyo Takeda, produced electronic light gun games where the gun would shoot a beam of light at the photocells, which would act as targets. After Uemura was hired for Nintendo in 1971, they released the Laser Clay Shooting System in January 1973, an arcade game where players shot at projected images of pigeons, with shots registered by photoreceptors. Though it was initially successful, the 1973 oil crisis led to the cancellation of most orders for the machine, leaving Nintendo, which borrowed money to expand the business, approximately ¥5 billion in debt. As the company recovered, they then produced a miniaturized version of the concept for the home market, 1976&#x27;s Duck Hunt, a success that would later be adapted into the 1984 video game of the same name.

When then-Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi split Nintendo into separate research &amp; development divisions, he appointed Uemura as head of R&amp;D2, a division that focused on hardware. Uemura led the development of the Color TV-Game line of dedicated consoles.

In November 1981, Uemura received a phone call from Yamauchi, who asked him to make &quot;something that lets you play arcade games on your TV at home.&quot; Collaborating with Ricoh, he and his team began creating a system that could run Nintendo&#x27;s hit arcade game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. Released in July 1983, this console became the Family Computer (commonly known by the Japanese-English term Famicom), an 8-bit console using interchangeable cartridges. Despite his initial pessimism of the console, it soon proved to be a success, selling 2.5 million units by the end of 1984. Due to the video game crash of 1983, when consumers had little trust in game consoles due to poor quality control, the Famicom underwent a redesign when brought to the United States, its first Western market. The cartridge slot was changed to be front-loading to mimic the tape deck of a VCR and to reduce the risk of static electricity in drier climates, while the NES Zapper was bundled to appeal to Americans&#x27; interest in guns. Rebranded as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the console would also prove successful overseas. Uemura then designed the Famicom Disk System, a Japan-only add-on for the Famicom that played games on floppy disks.

In 1988, Uemura began designing the Super Famicom, the Famicom&#x27;s 16-bit successor, which would be demonstrated to the Japanese press. He and his team worked with Ken Kutaragi, an engineer from Sony who designed the system&#x27;s sound chip and would later develop the PlayStation. First released in Japan in 1990, it would be christened the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the West. In 1995, his team released the Satellaview, an add-on for the Super Famicom that let players download content via satellite broadcast.

During his time at Nintendo, he also produced video games, including &quot;Soccer&quot;, &quot;Baseball&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot;, &quot;Ice Climber,&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Uemura retired from Nintendo in 2004, remaining an advisor in the Research and Engineering Department. He became a professor at Ritsumeikan University, researching and teaching about video games.

On 26 February 2020, Uemura spoke at the National Videogame Museum in the United Kingdom about his career.

== Death ==
Uemura died on 6 December 2021, at the age of 78.

<text>Real Sex is a documentary television series broadcast on and a production of HBO. As its name implies, &quot;Real Sex&quot; is a sexually explicit &quot;magazine&quot; which &quot;explores sex &#x27;90s style.&quot;

&quot;Real Sex&quot; explores human sexuality. Gary R. Edgerton and Jeffrey P. Jones described the fare in &quot;The Essential HBO Reader&quot; as &quot;a peek into the diversity of sexual activities...with an emphasis that ranges from the unusual to the bizarre.&quot; The show typically explores three to four topics each episode. Segments are separated by street interviews with random people, relating to the episode&#x27;s topics.

It spawned a spin-off series called &quot;Pornucopia&quot;.

==Episode guide==

==Lost Media Status==

While a hit show for HBO during its original run in the 90s (with HBO rerunning the series and compiling &quot;best of&quot; episodes to air late night well into the early 2000s), the series has become lost media. HBO has declined to include it in any of its various streaming services such as HBO Go and HBO Max/Max. In the Vice documentary series &quot;Sex Before The Internet&quot;, series creator Sheila Nevins lamented the show&#x27;s lost media status; stating that HBO largely disowned the series after finding mainstream critical success with shows like &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;The Wire&quot; and considers the series and other sexually explicit shows such as &quot;The Cathouse&quot;, as old shames.

<doc id="623620" wikidata="Q5635049" url="?curid=623620" title="HMS Zulu (F124)">
<text>HMS &quot;Zulu&quot; (F124) was a of the Royal Navy in service from 1964 to 1984. She was the third ship bearing the name of , having been named after an ethnic group located primarily in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. &quot;Zulu&quot; was built by Alexander Stephen and Sons, of Govan. She was launched on 3 July 1962 and commissioned on 17 April 1964.

She was sold to the Indonesian Navy in 1984 and renamed KRI &quot;Martha Khristina Tiyahahu&quot; (331).

==Design and construction==
The Tribal-, or Type 81-class, frigates were developed in the mid-1950s as a General Purpose frigate, capable of use in both anti-submarine and anti-aircraft duties in a full-scale war, while serving for Cold War policing duties in peace-time, in particular to replace the old s serving in the Persian Gulf.

The Tribals were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of . The ship&#x27;s hull had a draught of , with the propeller increasing overall draught to . Displacement was standard and full load. Propulsion was by a single-shaft Combined steam and gas (COSAG) arrangement, effectively half of the powerplant of the s. A single Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler fed steam at and to a geared steam turbine rated at , which could be supplemented by a Metrovick G-6 gas turbine rated at to reach top speed, with the gas turbine also allowing the ship to get underway quickly in an emergency, without having to wait to raise steam. Speed was about using both steam and gas turbine power, and on steam power alone.

The ships were fitted with two QF 4.5-in (113 mm) Mark 5 guns, salvaged from scrapped Second World War destroyers, mounted fore and aft. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of two Seacat anti-aircraft missile launchers with a GWS 21 director. For anti-submarine and anti-ship duties, a hangar and flight deck for a single Westland Wasp helicopter was fitted, while a Limbo anti-submarine mortar provided close-in anti-submarine armament. &quot;Mohawk&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on a lattice foremast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 978 navigation radar also fitted. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar. The ship had a crew of 253 officers and other ranks. Two 20mm Oerlikon cannon were later fitted for use against small boats during low intensity patrol and policing duties.

&quot;Zulu&quot; was laid down at Alexander Stephen and Sons, Govan, Glasgow shipyard on 13 December 1960. She was launched on 3 July 1962 and commissioned on 17 April 1964. The ship&#x27;s cost was £5,100,000. &quot;Zulu&quot; was the only Tribal completed with Seacat missiles; her six sister frigates were built with two 40 mm Bofors guns and fitted with the Seacat system during later refits.

==Royal Navy Service==

After commissioning and workup, &quot;Zulu&quot; joined the 9th Frigate Squadron, operating east of Suez. On 1 July 1965, &quot;Zulu&quot; went to the assistance of survivors from the Greek merchant ship , who had abandoned ship and came ashore on Abd al Kuri island, South Yemen. On 16 August 1965, &quot;Zulu&quot; returned to the UK for refit, which was completed at Rosyth in January 1966. In 1966, &quot;Zulu&quot; contributed to the Beira Patrol off the coast of East Africa, assisting in the enforcement of an oil blockade on Rhodesia. She was on patrol for over 120 days in 1967, intercepting four ships suspected of carrying oil for Rhodesia.

From January to October 1967 &quot;Zulu&quot; was commanded by the future Admiral of the Fleet William Staveley. On 23 October 1970, the Liberian-flagged tanker collided with the tanker off the Isle of Wight and caught fire with 13 killed aboard &quot;Pacific Glory&quot;. &quot;Zulu&quot; and the frigate , together with the civilian tenders &quot;Atherfield&quot; and &quot;Culver&quot;, helped to fight the fire aboard the stricken tanker.

In 1972, a United States Navy P-3 Orion aircraft crashed on a mountain in northern Morocco with the loss of 14 crew. &quot;Zulu&quot;&#x27;s Westland Wasp helicopter was sent to the wreckage site, where five bodies were found. In 1974, &quot;Zulu&quot; deployed to the West Indies. When Guatemala threatened to annex Belize in 1975, &quot;Zulu&quot; steamed to the area from an American port to augment British forces. Such was the urgency that Zulu left 20 sailors behind.

In 1977, &quot;Zulu&quot; was presented at the Spithead Fleet Review, held in honour of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. At this time she was part of the 4th Frigate Squadron. Later that year, &quot;Zulu&quot; formed part of the eight-ship Group 6 deployment, led by the cruiser , on naval exercises in the Far East.

Manpower shortages in the Royal Navy necessitated &quot;Zulu&quot; being reduced to reserve in 1979, as part of the Standby Squadron. She was placed on the disposal list in 1981. During the Falklands War, &quot;Zulu&quot; was taken out of reserve and prepared for active service, recommissioning on 9 August. She operated in home waters and as the West Indies Guard Ship.

In November 1983 &quot;Zulu&quot; became the Gibraltar Guardship. Before decommissioning on 30 March 1984, &quot;Zulu&quot;, as the last ship in commission with more than one gun turret, fired the Royal Navy&#x27;s last &quot;full&quot; broadside.

==Indonesian Navy Service==

Indonesia bought &quot;Zulu&quot; on 16 April 1984, renaming the frigate KRI &quot;Martha Khristina Tiyahahu&quot;, in honour of Martha Christina Tiahahu, who fought against Dutch colonial forces. After refit at Vosper Thornycroft&#x27;s Woolston yard, the ship commissioned into the Indonesian Navy on 2 May 1985. The frigate was struck from the Indonesian Naval Vessel Register in 2000.

<doc id="623623" wikidata="Q1634483" url="?curid=623623" title="The House on Chelouche Street">
<text>The House on Chelouche Street () is a 1973 semi-autobiographical film by Israeli director Moshé Mizrahi, who also co-wrote the screenplay. It was filmed in Hebrew, Egyptian Arabic and Judeo-Spanish (a.k.a. Ladino, a Jewish language mostly derived from Old Castilian). The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

This is the first Israeli film whose plot is set during the British Mandate in the land of Israel.

The film is largely based on the personal biography of its creator, Moshe Mizrahi. In 1946, at the age of 15, Mizrahi immigrated to Israel from Alexandria with his widowed mother and younger brother Shabtai. They settled in Jaffa. On July 13, 1948, his nine-year-old brother was killed in an Egyptian bombing of Tel Aviv.

==Plot==
The film tells the story of a Sephardi family of Egyptian Jewish immigrants from Alexandria that settle in 1947 Tel Aviv. The family consists of a 33-year-old widowed wife, Clara, (played by Gila Almagor, one of the most prominent actresses in Israel for the last three decades) and her four children. They live in a working-class neighborhood surrounded by their extended family, including Clara&#x27;s mother Mazal, Clara&#x27;s uncle Rafael, and Sultana, his wife.

The plot centers on the firstborn, Sami, his transition from a shy 15-year-old to a working man and an activist in the &quot;Irgun&quot; (a resistance movement that acted mainly against the military forces of the British), and the romantic attachment he develops with a 25-year-old Russian immigrant librarian (Michal Bat-Adam, now a director). In addition to this, Clara struggles between social pressure to take a husband and her own complex feelings surrounding this, complicated by another Sephardi Egyptian, played by Yosef Shiloach, who has strong feelings for her.

The film is a vivid and very credible description of the lives of Sephardi immigrant families on the eve of the declaration of the state of Israel. Also covered are the escalating violence between British forces and the local populace, as well as Palestinian Arab violence towards Jews.

The music in the film is accompanied by songs performed by Shoshana Damari, the most famous of which is the closing song, &quot;By the Light of Memories&quot; (lyrics by Mohar, composed by Wilensky).

<text>Peter Andrew Stewart Milliken (born November 12, 1946) is a Canadian lawyer and politician. He was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 until his retirement in 2011 and served as Speaker of the House for 10 years beginning in 2001. Milliken represented the Ontario riding of Kingston and the Islands as a member of the Liberal Party. On October 12, 2009, he became the longest serving Speaker of the House of Commons in Canadian history. His Speakership was notable for the number of tie-breaking votes he was required to make as well as for making several historic rulings. Milliken also has the unique distinction of being the first Speaker to preside over four Parliaments. His legacy includes his landmark rulings on Parliament&#x27;s right to information, which are key elements of parliamentary precedent both in Canada and throughout the Commonwealth.

Milliken chose to stand down from Parliament at the 2011 federal election. His successor as Speaker, Andrew Scheer, was elected on June 2, 2011.

==Early life and career==
Milliken was born in Kingston, Ontario, the eldest of seven children to a physician father, and is a descendant of United Empire Loyalists who left the new United States of America after the American Revolution. He is the cousin of John Matheson, a former Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) best known for his prominent role in adopting the red maple leaf as the Flag of Canada. Milliken holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Economics from Queen&#x27;s University (1968), a Bachelor of Arts (1970) and Master of Arts (1978) in Jurisprudence from Oxford University, (Wadham College), in England, and a Bachelor of Laws (1971) degree from Dalhousie University. He was active in student politics, and served a year as speaker of the student government&#x27;s assembly at Queen&#x27;s. In 1967-68, he worked as a special assistant to federal cabinet minister George J. McIlraith.

Called to the Ontario Bar in 1973, Milliken was a partner at the prestigious Kingston law firm, Cunningham, Swan, Carty, Little &amp; Bonham, before entering political life. He also lectured on a part-time basis at the Queen&#x27;s University School of Business from 1973 to 1981, became a governor of the Kingston General Hospital in 1977, and has been a trustee with the Chalmers United Church. As a consultant, he produced the Milliken Report on the future of Queen&#x27;s University athletics in the late 1970s. A fan of classical music, he has sung with the Pro Arte Singers and the Chalmers United Church Choir as well as serving on the board of the Kingston Symphony. He also often canoes, taking week-long trips in northern Canada. In 2001, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the State University of New York at Potsdam. He is an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada, and an Honorary Patron of Choirs Ontario.

Milliken has long been active in political matters, having served as president of the Frontenac Addington Provincial Liberal Association Kingston in the 1980s. He subscribed to the Canadian House of Commons Hansard at age sixteen, and once wrote a thesis paper on Question Period. Unlike most MPs, he was already well-versed in parliamentary procedure at the time of his first election.

==Member of Parliament==
Milliken won the Kingston and the Islands Liberal nomination in 1988 over local alderman Alex Lampropoulos, and defeated well-known Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Flora MacDonald by 2,712 votes in the 1988 general election. The Progressive Conservatives won the election with a majority government, and in early 1989 Milliken was named as the Liberal Party&#x27;s critic for electoral reform, associate critic for senior citizens, and whip for eastern and northern Ontario. Shortly thereafter, he was named to the parliamentary standing committee on elections, privileges, procedures and private members&#x27; business. He supported Jean Chrétien for the federal Liberal leadership in 1990.

He was easily re-elected in the 1993 election, as the Liberal Party won a majority government, and was named to a two-year term as parliamentary secretary to the Government House Leader in December 1993. He also became chair of the Commons Procedure and House Affairs Committee. Milliken was a leading candidate for Speaker of the House in January 1994, but lost to Gilbert Parent.

Milliken supported fellow Kingstonian John Gerretsen for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1996, and moved to the camp of the eventual winner, Dalton McGuinty, after Gerretsen was eliminated on the second ballot. In the same year, Milliken and fellow Liberal MP John Godfrey introduced the Godfrey-Milliken Bill as a satirical response to the American Helms-Burton Act. The Bill, which would have allowed the descendants of United Empire Loyalists to claim compensation for land seized in the American Revolution, was drafted in response to provisions in the Helms-Burton Act which sought to punish Canadian companies for using land nationalised by Fidel Castro&#x27;s government in Cuba. Godfrey and Milliken gave a twenty-minute presentation on their bill in Washington, D.C. in early 1997, and were greeted with warm applause from local Helms-Burton opponents.

Milliken was re-elected for a third term in 1997 election, and became Deputy Speaker of the House for the parliament that followed.

==Speaker of the House==
Milliken was elected Speaker of the House in late January 2001, after five ballots of a secret vote of all MPs held at the first sitting of parliament following the 2000 federal election. He was widely praised by government and opposition MPs for his rulings, which were considered very fair. He also brought new life to the chair in delivering his rulings and remarks with witty humour. Elected for his fifth term in 2004, he was the unanimous choice of MPs to be re-elected Speaker for the next parliament.

In 2005, Milliken prevented an early federal election by breaking a tie vote on the second reading of Bill C-48, an amendment to the 2005 federal budget, which was a confidence motion. The vote was 152 in favour and 152 against prior to his vote, and he voted in favour of the bill. The Speaker does not vote except in the case of a tie, and must vote, by precedent, in such a way as to keep the matter open for further consideration if possible (i.e. passing C-48 to allow further debate for a third reading). This was the first time in Canadian history that a Speaker used his tie-breaker vote on a confidence motion. Upon rising to give brief remarks and cast his vote, he remarked &quot;I don&#x27;t know why honourable members keep doing this to me.&quot;
Milliken won his riding for a sixth time in the 2006 election, as the Conservative Party won a minority government nationally. Though his party was no longer in government, he was re-elected Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on April 3, 2006, defeating fellow Liberals Diane Marleau and Marcel Proulx on the first ballot. With his re-election, he became only the second Speaker chosen from an opposition party in the history of the House of Commons (James Jerome, Liberal Member of Parliament for the Sudbury riding during the Joe Clark government, being the other).

In February 2007, Milliken rejected the Conservative government&#x27;s challenge of an opposition bill that commits the government to implement the Kyoto Accord. The government argued that the bill introduced new spending, and could not be introduced by someone who was not a minister. Milliken ruled that the bill did not specifically commit the government to any new spending, and was therefore in order. The bill was approved by the house, despite government opposition.

Milliken was re-elected for a seventh term in the 2008 federal election, which again yielded a Conservative minority government. On November 18, after five ballots, he was elected for the fourth time as Speaker. On October 12, 2009, he became the longest serving Canadian House of Commons speaker in history.

The Speaker only votes in order to break a tie. Speakers of the House of Commons have only needed to vote eleven times in Canadian parliamentary history – he cast five of the ten votes
since Confederation.

On March 18, 2010, the three opposition parties asked Milliken to make a pivotal ruling on a question of privilege (specifically the power to send for persons, papers and records), in regards to Parliament&#x27;s request for documents on the transfer of Afghan detainees, a notable issue in 2009 and 2010. On April 27, 2010, Milliken ruled that Parliament had a right to ask for uncensored documents. He asked that all House leaders, ministers and MPs to come to a collective solution by May 11, 2010 &quot;without compromising the security and confidentiality contained.&quot;.

On March 9, 2011, Milliken made two historic rulings finding a &quot;prima facie&quot; case of contempt of Parliament against the government of Stephen Harper, referring the matter to the Procedure Committee. The House subsequently voted to &quot;agree with the finding of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs that the government is in contempt of Parliament&quot; in supporting a non-confidence vote on March 25, 2011. Prior to the vote, the last House of Commons which Milliken would preside over, the Speaker was praised by MPs from all sides of the House. Conservative Government House Leader John Baird paid homage to Milliken&#x27;s career, recalling a meeting he&#x27;d had with the Speaker of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. &quot;The Speaker of the Commons there said that he and Speakers from all around the Commonwealth look to you as their leader and their inspiration as someone who has conducted himself very professionally. For a Canadian to hear that from a British Speaker is a pretty remarkable conclusion and assessment of your role as Speaker.&quot; Baird predicted that Milliken would &quot;go down in history as, if not one of the best Speakers, the best Speaker the House of Commons has ever had.&quot;

His is also known to be the first person to start the tradition of the Speaker releasing an official Scotch whisky.

Opposition Leader Michael Ignatieff said of Milliken, &quot;You have taught us all – sometimes with modest rebuke, sometimes with stern force of argument – to understand, to respect and to cherish the rules of Canadian democracy, and for that alone all Canadians will be grateful to you.&quot;

==Post-Commons career==
On June 18, 2011, Milliken chaired the Liberal Party of Canada constitutional convention which was held by conference call in order to decide whether or not to amend the party&#x27;s constitution in order to allow the party&#x27;s leadership convention to be delayed until 2013.

Later that month, Milliken joined Queen&#x27;s University as a Fellow at the School of Policy Studies where he teaches and conducts research. He has also returned to the firm of Cunningham Swan Carty Little &amp; Bonham LLP as Senior Advisor. Milliken also now serves as an elected member of the Governing Board of The University Club at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston.

On May 9, 2012, Milliken&#x27;s official portrait was unveiled on Parliament Hill, and was hung in the Speaker&#x27;s Corridor of the Centre Block. The portrait was painted by American-Canadian artist Paul Wyse.

<doc id="623630" wikidata="Q3557298" url="?curid=623630" title="Victor Feguer">
<text>Victor Harry Feguer (1935 – March 15, 1963) was an American convicted murderer who was known as the last federal inmate executed in the United States before the moratorium on the death penalty following &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, as well as the last person put to death in the state of Iowa. While the media did not pay much attention to Feguer or his execution at the time, Timothy McVeigh&#x27;s execution sparked renewed media interest in him.

==Background==
Feguer was a drifter, native to the state of Michigan. In the summer of 1960, Feguer arrived in Dubuque, Iowa, renting a room at a decrepit boarding house. Soon after arriving, Feguer began phoning physicians alphabetically from the local Yellow Pages and found Dr. Edward Bartels. Feguer claimed that a woman needed medical attention. When Dr. Bartels arrived, Feguer kidnapped and killed him in Illinois. Bartels&#x27; body was found in a cornfield there with a single gunshot to the head. A few days later, Feguer was arrested in Birmingham, Alabama, after trying to sell Dr. Bartels&#x27; car to James B. Alford, who tipped off the FBI. Alford later told a local newspaper he suspected Feguer was a crook because he had an out-of-state car but no title papers.

Authorities believe that Feguer had kidnapped and killed Dr. Bartels in order to gain access to any drugs that Bartels may have carried to treat patients. Because Feguer transported his hostage across state lines, federal charges were filed against Feguer. In his defense, Feguer claimed a drug addict from Chicago, whom Feguer met in Dubuque, had actually murdered Bartels. Feguer said he killed the drug addict and dumped his body in the Mississippi River. However, authorities could not find any evidence that this other person ever existed.

Because Feguer crossed state lines during the commission of the crimes, he was tried and convicted in federal court. He was sentenced to death. Feguer submitted an appeal, which was denied. At that point, only President John F. Kennedy could have commuted the death sentence. Iowa&#x27;s governor, Harold Hughes, an opponent of capital punishment, along with Feguer&#x27;s attorney, contacted Kennedy to request clemency for Feguer. Kennedy thought the crime was so brutal that he denied their request.

==Last days==
===At Fort Madison===
Victor Feguer was held at the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. He was taken back to Iowa because Leavenworth was not set up at the time to perform executions.

On March 5, 1963, Feguer was taken to the Iowa State Penitentiary at Fort Madison, Iowa and placed in the state&#x27;s death row to await execution. He remained there for the next ten days until his execution was carried out. He spent those ten days quietly; guards said he was a model prisoner.

===March 15, 1963===
For his last meal, Feguer requested a single olive with the pit still in it. He told guards he hoped an olive tree would sprout from his grave &quot;as a sign of peace&quot;.

On March 14, 1963, Feguer sat in an all-night vigil with a Roman Catholic priest. Between 4 and 5 in the morning of March 15, Feguer was given a new suit for his execution. Two guards escorted him to the execution room, and he was executed by hanging. The witnesses included an Associated Press journalist and John Ely, then a member of the Iowa House of Representatives, whose witnessing of the execution reinforced his opposition to the death penalty, leading him to work to abolish the state death penalty in Iowa, which occurred in 1965, but which had no effect on the federal law under which Feguer had been executed. After Feguer was pronounced dead, authorities found the pit from the olive in one of his suit pockets.

The body was removed by a local funeral home. Feguer&#x27;s death certificate listed &quot;Execution. Fracture Cervical Spinal Column&quot; as the cause of death. Feguer was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Madison City Cemetery in Iowa wearing a second new suit that was provided for his burial.

==Aftermath==
Victor Feguer would be the last person to be executed in Iowa. After Feguer&#x27;s death, it would be nearly 40 years until the next federal execution – that of Timothy McVeigh, carried out on June 11, 2001, in Terre Haute, Indiana.

Iowa abolished capital punishment for all crimes in 1965. Over the years, several attempts have been made to reinstate the death penalty in Iowa. This became a major issue in the 1994 election, as a young girl had recently been murdered, as well as in 2005 after the murder of another young girl. However, the legislature declined to reinstate capital punishment.

Previous Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack made it clear that he would veto legislation that would restore capital punishment, even if it was only on a limited basis. Iowa is one of 23 U.S. states to have completely abolished capital punishment.

<text>Harry Max Markowitz (August 24, 1927 – June 22, 2023) was an American economist who received the 1989 John von Neumann Theory Prize and the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

Markowitz was a professor of finance at the Rady School of Management at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). He is best known for his pioneering work in modern portfolio theory, studying the effects of asset risk, return, correlation and diversification on probable investment portfolio returns.

==Biography==
Harry Markowitz was born to a Jewish family, the son of Morris and Mildred Markowitz. During high school, Markowitz developed an interest in physics and philosophy, in particular the ideas of David Hume, an interest he continued to follow during his undergraduate years at the University of Chicago. After receiving his Ph.B. in Liberal Arts, Markowitz decided to continue his studies at the University of Chicago, choosing to specialize in economics. There he had the opportunity to study under important economists, including Milton Friedman, Tjalling Koopmans, Jacob Marschak and Leonard Savage. While still a student, he was invited to become a member of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, which was in Chicago at the time. He completed his A.M. in Economics from the university in 1950.

Markowitz chose to apply mathematics to the analysis of the stock market as the topic for his dissertation. Jacob Marschak, who was the thesis advisor, encouraged him to pursue the topic, noting that it had also been a favorite interest of Alfred Cowles, the founder of the Cowles Commission. While researching the then current understanding of stock prices, which at the time consisted in the present value model of John Burr Williams, Markowitz realized that the theory lacks an analysis of the impact of risk. This insight led to the development of his seminal theory of portfolio allocation under uncertainty, published in 1952 by &quot;the Journal of Finance&quot;.

In 1952, Harry Markowitz went to work for the RAND Corporation, where he met George Dantzig. With Dantzig&#x27;s help, Markowitz continued to research optimization techniques, further developing the critical line algorithm for the identification of the optimal mean-variance portfolios, relying on what was later named the Markowitz frontier. It was also in 1952 that Markowitz published &quot;Portfolio Selection&quot;, his first paper dissecting investment portfolio strategy.

In 1954, he received a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago with a thesis on the portfolio theory. The topic was so novel that, while Markowitz was defending his dissertation, Milton Friedman argued his contribution was not economics. During 1955–1956 Markowitz spent a year at the Cowles Foundation, which had moved to Yale University, at the invitation of James Tobin. He published the critical line algorithm in a 1956 paper and used this time at the foundation to write a book on portfolio allocation which was published in 1959.

Markowitz won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 while a professor of finance at Baruch College of the City University of New York. In the preceding year, he received the John von Neumann Theory Prize from the Operations Research Society of America (now Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences, INFORMS) for his contributions in the theory of three fields: portfolio theory; sparse matrix methods; and simulation language programming (SIMSCRIPT). Sparse matrix methods are now widely used to solve very large systems of simultaneous equations whose coefficients are mostly zero. SIMSCRIPT has been widely used to program computer simulations of manufacturing, transportation, and computer systems as well as war games. SIMSCRIPT (I) included the Buddy memory allocation method, which was also developed by Markowitz.
He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.

===CACI===
The company that would become CACI International was founded by Herb Karr and Harry Markowitz on July 17, 1962, as California Analysis Center, Inc. They helped develop SIMSCRIPT, the first simulation programming language, at RAND and after it was released to the public domain, CACI was founded to provide support and training for SIMSCRIPT.

In 1968, Markowitz joined Arbitrage Management company founded by Michael Goodkin. Working with Paul Samuelson and Robert Merton he created a hedge fund that represents one of the first known attempts at computerized arbitrage trading. He took over as chief executive in 1970. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart &amp; Co. in 1971. A year later, Markowitz left the company.

Years later, he was involved with CACI&#x27;s SIMSCRIPT addition of Object-oriented features.

===Post-CACI===
Markowitz divided his time between teaching (he was an adjunct professor at the Rady School of Management at the University of California at San Diego, UCSD); video casting lectures; and consulting (out of his Harry Markowitz Company offices). He served on the Advisory Board of SkyView Investment Advisors, a traditional and alternative investment advisory firm. Markowitz also served on the Investment Committee of LWI Financial Inc. (&quot;Loring Ward&quot;), a San Jose, California-based investment advisor; on the advisory panel of Robert D. Arnott&#x27;s Newport Beach, California based investment management firm, Research Affiliates; on the Advisory Board of Mark T. Hebner&#x27;s Irvine, California and internet based wealth management and taxes firm, Index Fund Advisors; and as an advisor to the Investment Committee of 1st Global, a Dallas, Texas-based wealth management and investment advisory firm. Markowitz advised and served on the board of ProbabilityManagement.org, a 501(c)(3) non-profit that aims &quot;to reshape the communication and calculation of uncertainty.&quot;

Markowitz was co-founder and Chief Architect of GuidedChoice, a 401(k) managed accounts provider and investment advisor. Markowitz&#x27;s more recent work included designing the backbone software analytics for the GuidedChoice investment solution and heading the GuidedChoice Investment Committee. He was actively involved in designing the next step in the retirement process: assisting retirees with wealth distribution through GuidedSpending.

Markowitz died on June 22, 2023 at the age of 95. He died in a hospital in San Diego, California due to complications from pneumonia and sepsis.

==Research==
A &quot;Markowitz-efficient portfolio&quot; is one where diversification cannot lower the portfolio&#x27;s risk for a given return expectation (alternately, no additional expected return can be gained without increasing the risk of the portfolio). The Markowitz Efficient Frontier is the set of all portfolios that will give the highest expected return for each given level of risk. These concepts of efficiency were essential to the development of the capital asset pricing model.

Markowitz also co-edited the textbook &quot;The Theory and Practice of Investment Management&quot; with Frank J. Fabozzi of Yale School of Management. In the same line, Markowitz was part of the Editorial Board of AESTIMATIO, the IEB International Journal of Finance.

<doc id="623636" wikidata="Q6706509" url="?curid=623636" title="Luz (biblical place)">
<text>Luz ( &quot;Lūz&quot;) is the name of two places in the Bible.

==Mentioned in Genesis==
Luz is the ancient name of a royal Canaanite city, connected with Bethel (Genesis 28:19; 35:6). It is debated among scholars whether Luz and Bethel represent the same town - the former the Canaanite name, and the latter the Hebrew name - or whether they were distinct places in close proximity to each other. According to the King James Version (KJV), Luz was renamed by Jacob: &quot;And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.” (Genesis 28:19)

==Mentioned in Book of Judges==
A second city called Luz, founded by a man who came from the original Luz, is mentioned in Judges 1:23: 22And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and the LORD was with them. 23 And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el—now the name of the city beforetime was Luz. 24 And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him: &#x27;Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.&#x27; 25 And he showed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family. 26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof unto this day.

This second Luz is identified by some with Wazzani, four miles northwest of Banias, in the Golan Heights.

<text>Dead Souls ( , pre-reform spelling: ) is a novel by Nikolai Gogol, first published in 1842, and widely regarded as an exemplar of 19th-century Russian literature. The novel chronicles the travels and adventures of Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov and the people whom he encounters. These people typify the Russian middle aristocracy of the time. Gogol himself saw his work as an &quot;epic poem in prose&quot;, and within the book characterised it as a &quot;poem in prose&quot;. Gogol intended the novel to be the first part of a three-volume work, but burned the manuscript of the second part shortly before his death. Although the novel ends in mid-sentence (like Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;), it is regarded by some as complete in the extant form.

==Title==
The original title, as shown on the illustration (cover page), was &quot;The Wanderings of Chichikov, or Dead Souls. &quot;Poema&quot;&quot;, which contracted to merely &quot;Dead Souls&quot;. In the Russian Empire, before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, landowners had the right to own serfs to farm their land. Serfs were for most purposes considered the property of the landowner, who could buy, sell or mortgage them, as any other chattel. To count serfs (and people in general), the classifier &quot;soul&quot; was used: e.g., &quot;six souls of serfs&quot;. The plot of the novel relies on &quot;dead souls&quot; (i.e., &quot;dead serfs&quot;) which are still accounted for in property registers. On another level, the title refers to the &quot;dead souls&quot; of Gogol&#x27;s characters, all of which represent different aspects of &quot;poshlost&quot; (a Russian noun rendered as &quot;commonplace, vulgarity&quot;, moral and spiritual, with overtones of middle-class pretentiousness, fake significance and philistinism).

It is also described as a picaresque novel, a literary genre virtually non-existent in Russian literature of the times.

==Background==
&quot;Dead Souls&quot; has been compared to Miguel Cervantes &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and Charles Dickens &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. The plot for the novel was suggested by Gogol&#x27;s friend Alexander Pushkin.

Early 20th century critics began to suggest the story contained elements that may have been inspired by &quot;Inferno&quot; of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, but that idea has since diminished among scholars. &quot;Gogol reveals to his readers an encompassing picture of the ailing social system in Russia after the unsuccessful French invasion. As in many of Gogol&#x27;s short stories, the social criticism of &quot;Dead Souls&quot; is communicated primarily through absurd and hilarious satire.&quot; Unlike the short stories, however, &quot;Dead Souls&quot; was meant to offer solutions rather than simply point out problems. This grander scheme was largely unrealized at Gogol&#x27;s death; the work was never completed, and it is primarily the earlier, darker part of the novel that is remembered.

In their studies of Gogol, Andrey Bely, D. S. Mirsky, Vladimir Nabokov, and other modernist critics rejected the commonly held view of &quot;Dead Souls&quot; as a reformist or satirical work. For instance, Nabokov regarded the plot of &quot;Dead Souls&quot; as unimportant and Gogol as a great writer whose works skirted the irrational and whose prose style combined superb descriptive power with a disregard for novelistic clichés. True, Chichikov displays a most extraordinary moral rot, but the whole idea of buying and selling dead souls is, to Nabokov, ridiculous on its face; therefore, the provincial setting of the novel is a most unsuitable backdrop for any of the progressive, reformist or Christian readings of the work.

==Structure==

The novel has a circular structure, following Chichikov as he visits the estates of landowners living around the capital of a guberniya. Although Gogol aspired to emulate the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, many critics derive the structure of &quot;Dead Souls&quot; from the picaresque novels of the 16th and 17th centuries in that it is divided into a series of somewhat disjointed episodes, and the plot concerns a gentrified version of the rascal protagonist of the original picaresques.

Konstantin Aksakov was the first to bring out a detailed juxtaposition of Gogol&#x27;s and Homer&#x27;s works: &quot;Gogol&#x27;s epic revives the ancient Homeric epic; you recognize its character of importance, its artistic merits and the widest scope. When comparing one thing to another, Gogol completely loses himself in the subject, leaving for a time the occasion that gave rise to his comparison; he will talk about it, until the subject is exhausted. Every reader of &quot;The Iliad&quot; was struck by this device, too.&quot; Nabokov also pointed out the Homeric roots of the complicated absurdist technique of Gogol&#x27;s comparisons and digressions.

==Characters==
Of all Gogol&#x27;s creations, Chichikov stands out as the incarnation of the complacent &quot;poshlost&quot;. Other characters—the squires Chichikov visits on his shady business—include: Sobakevich, a strong, silent, economical man; Manilov, a sentimentalist with pursed lips; Mme. Korobochka, a widow; Nozdryov, a bully. Plyushkin, the miser, appears to transcend the &quot;poshlost&quot; archetype in that he is not complacent but miserable.

==Plot==
===Book One===
The story follows the exploits of Chichikov, a middle-aged gentleman of middling social class and means. Chichikov arrives in a small town and turns on the charm to woo key local officials and landowners. He reveals little about his past, or his purpose, as he sets about carrying out his bizarre and mysterious plan to acquire &quot;dead souls.&quot;

The government taxed landowners based on how many serfs (or &quot;souls&quot;) they owned. This was determined by the census, which was conducted infrequently, so landowners were often paying taxes on serfs that were no longer living, thus &quot;dead souls.&quot; It is these dead souls, existing only on paper, that Chichikov seeks to purchase from the landlords in the villages he visits, whom he tells he will relieve of a needless tax burden.

Although the townspeople Chichikov comes across are gross caricatures, they are not flat stereotypes by any means. Instead, each is neurotically individual, combining the official failings that Gogol typically satirizes (greed, corruption, paranoia) with a curious set of personal quirks.
Setting off for the surrounding estates, Chichikov at first assumes that the ignorant provincials will be more than eager to give their dead souls up in exchange for a token payment. The task of collecting the rights to dead people proves difficult, however, due to the persistent greed, suspicion, and general distrust of the landowners. He still manages to acquire some 400 souls, swears the sellers to secrecy, and returns to the town to have the transactions recorded legally.

Back in the town, Chichikov continues to be treated like a prince amongst the petty officials, and a celebration is thrown in honour of his purchases. Very suddenly, however, rumours flare up that the serfs he bought are all dead, and that he was planning to elope with the Governor&#x27;s daughter. In the confusion that ensues, the backwardness of the irrational, gossip-hungry townspeople is most delicately conveyed. Absurd suggestions come to light, such as the possibility that Chichikov is Napoleon in disguise or the notorious vigilante &#x27;Captain Kopeikin&#x27;. The now disgraced traveller is immediately ostracized from the company he had been enjoying and has no choice but to flee the town.

Chichikov is revealed by the author to be a former mid-level government official fired for corruption and narrowly avoiding jail. His macabre mission to acquire &quot;dead souls&quot; is actually just another one of his &quot;get rich quick&quot; schemes. Once he acquires enough dead souls, he will take out an enormous loan against them and pocket the money.

===Book Two===
In the novel&#x27;s second part, Chichikov flees to another part of Russia and attempts to continue his venture. He tries to help the idle landowner Tentetnikov gain favor with General Betrishchev so that Tentetnikov may marry the general&#x27;s daughter, Ulinka. To do this, Chichikov agrees to visit many of Betrishchev&#x27;s relatives, beginning with Colonel Koshkaryov. From there Chichikov begins again to go from estate to estate, encountering eccentric and absurd characters all along the way. Eventually he purchases an estate from the destitute Khlobuyev, and somewhere in the missing chapters is arrested when he attempts to forge the will of Khlobuyev&#x27;s rich aunt. He is pardoned thanks to the intervention of the kindly Mourazov but is forced to flee the village. The novel ends mid-sentence with the prince who arranged Chichikov&#x27;s arrest giving a grand speech that rails against corruption in the Russian government.

==Adaptations==
Mikhail Bulgakov adapted the novel for the stage for a production at the Moscow Art Theatre. The seminal theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski directed the play, which opened on 28 November 1932.

The extant sections of &quot;Dead Souls&quot; formed the basis for an opera in 1976 by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin. In it Shchedrin captures the different townspeople with whom Chichikov deals in isolated musical episodes, each of which employs a different musical style to evoke the character&#x27;s particular personality.

The novel was adapted for screen in 1984 by Mikhail Schweitzer as a television miniseries of the same name.

In 2006 the novel was dramatised for radio in two parts by the BBC and broadcast on Radio 4. It was played more for comic than satirical effect, the main comedy deriving from the performance of Mark Heap as Chichikov and from the original placing of the narrator. Michael Palin narrates the story, but is revealed actually to be following Chichikov, riding in his coach for example, or sleeping in the same bed, constantly irritating Chichikov with his running exposition.

The first UK theatre production was staged by Theatre Collection in London during November 2014, directed by Victor Sobchak and starring Garry Voss as Chichikov and Vera Horton as Korobochka.

<doc id="623653" wikidata="Q1106834" url="?curid=623653" title="Gus Edwards (vaudevillian)">
<text>Gustave Edwards (August 18, 1878 – November 7, 1945) was an American composer, songwriter and film director. He also was a vaudevillian, organised his own theatre companies and was a music publisher.

==Early life==

Edwards was the son of Morris and Johanna Simon. He was born Gustav Schmelowsky in Inowrazlaw, German Empire (present-day Inowrocław, Poland). His family boarded the steamship &quot;Spaarndam&quot; as steerage passengers; they arrived at the Port of New York on 29 July 1891 ending up in Williamsburg. During the day, he worked in the family cigar store, and in the evenings, he wandered looking for any sort of show business job. He found work as a singer at various lodge halls, on ferry boat lounges, in saloons, and even between bouts at the athletic clubs.

As a very young boy, Edwards worked as a song plugger at Koster and Bial&#x27;s, at Tony Pastor&#x27;s theatre, and at the Bowery Theatre. In those old vaudeville days, song publishers would often hire a very young boy to sit in the theatre, and immediately after a vaudeville star had sung one of the publisher&#x27;s songs, the youngster would stand up in the audience, and pretending to be completely overcome by the song, break out in an &quot;extemporaneous&quot; solo of the same tune. In this way, the young Edwards would often sit in a balcony seat, and then stand and repeat a song that vaudeville stars such as Maggie Cline, Lottie Gilson or Emma Carus had just sung.

==Career==

In 1896, Edwards was 17 years old and appearing at Johnny Palmer&#x27;s Gaiety Saloon in Brooklyn, when James Hyde, a vaudeville agent, saw him performing. He booked a tour for Edwards and four other boys as The Newsboys Quintet act. In 1898, while performing in this act, Edwards wrote his first song, to a lyric by Tom Daly, &quot;All I Want is My Black Baby Back&quot;.

Edwards could not write music at that time, so he hired Charles Previn to write down the notes. May Irwin sang the song in her act, and helped to popularize it.

While entertaining soldiers at Camp Black, during the Spanish–American War, Edwards met lyricist Will Cobb, and they formed &quot;Words and Music&quot;, a partnership that lasted for many years. He was a vaudeville singer, and later had his own vaudeville company. He discovered Walter Winchell, Elsie Janis, George Jessel, Eddie Cantor, Groucho Marx, Phil Silvers, Lila Lee, Georgie Price, Eleanor Powell, Hildegarde, Ray Bolger, Sally Rand, Jack Pearl, the Lane Sisters, and Ina Ray Hutton. He wrote the Broadway stage scores for &quot;When We Were Forty-One&quot;, &quot;Hip Hip Hooray&quot;, &quot;The Merry-Go-Round&quot;, &quot;School Days&quot;, &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1910&quot;, &quot;Sunbonnet Sue&quot;, and &quot;Show Window&quot;. He founded the Gus Edwards Music Hall in New York, and also his own publishing company, then produced special subjects for films, and returned to vaudeville between 1930 and 1937, finally retiring in 1939. His chief musical collaborators included Edward Madden, Will Cobb, and Robert B. Smith. His other popular-song compositions include &quot;Meet Me Under the Wisteria&quot;, &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell You Why I Love You but I Do&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, Little Girl, Goodbye&quot;, &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Make My Eyes Behave&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be With You When the Roses Bloom Again&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s My Pal&quot;, &quot;Way Down Yonder in the Cornfield&quot;, &quot;In Zanzibar&quot;, &quot;If a Girl Like You Loved a Boy Like Me&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Valentine&quot;, &quot;If I Were a Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Laddie Boy&quot; and &quot;In My Merry Oldsmobile&quot;.

Some other songs include &quot;America Never Took Water and America Never Will&quot;, &quot;Au Revoir&quot;, &quot;Good Bye and Luck Be with You Laddie Boy&quot;, &quot;He Long and Lean and Lanky&quot;, &quot;Keep on A-Going&quot;, &quot;Mothers of Men&quot; and &quot;My Rainbow Ribbon Girl&quot;.

===Radio===
In the 1930s, Edwards had a weekly program, &quot;School Days of the Air&quot;, on KFWB in Los Angeles, California.

===Family===
Edwards was the brother of composer Leo Edwards, music publisher and talent agent Ben Edwards, and vaudeville songstress Dorothea Edwards. He was the uncle of Joan Edwards and Jack Edwards.

===Film===
Bing Crosby played Edwards in a fictionalized version of his life in the 1939 film &quot;The Star Maker&quot;, directed by Roy Del Ruth. Edwards himself made few screen appearances, the most notable being &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;, in which he performs as part of a vaudeville act. He also wrote all the music for &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;, as credited in the closing credits of the production, with the exception of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; with lyrics by Arthur Freed and music by Nacio Herb Brown. He also performs a specialty number: &quot;Lon Chaney&#x27;s Gonna Get You If You Don&#x27;t Watch Out&quot;.

===Recognition===
Edwards was a founding member of ASCAP in 1914 and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

==Personal life and death==
Edwards was married to the former Lillian Boulanger, who worked with him in putting on revues and cultivating performers. He died of a heart attack in Hollywood, California, on November 7, 1945, aged 66. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.

<doc id="623662" wikidata="Q287451" url="?curid=623662" title="Martin Ritt">
<text>Martin Ritt (March 2, 1914 – December 8, 1990) was an American director, producer, and actor, active in film, theatre and television. He was known mainly as an auteur of socially-conscious dramas and literary adaptations, described by Stanley Kauffmann as &quot;one of the most underrated American directors, superbly competent and quietly imaginative.&quot;

Ritt was an actor-turned-director with the Federal Theater Project and Group Theatre, becoming assistant to Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio. After a promising television directing career was cut short by the Second Red Scare, Ritt made his first film &quot;Edge of the City&quot; (1957). His 1958 film &quot;The Long, Hot Summer,&quot; based on the works of William Faulkner, was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the first of three times the director would be nominated for the honor.

His 1963 film &quot;Hud&quot; earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, and his 1965 John le Carré adaptation &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film. Two of his subsequent films, &quot;Sounder&quot; (1972) and &quot;Norma Rae&quot; (1979), were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars. Ritt directed many of the biggest stars of his time, including 13 of them to Academy Award wins or nominations - Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas, Patricia Neal, Richard Burton, James Earl Jones, Jane Alexander, Paul Winfield, Cicely Tyson, Geraldine Page, Sally Field, Rip Torn, Alfre Woodard and James Garner.

Four of his films (&quot;Edge of the City&quot;, &quot;Hud&quot;, &quot;Sounder&quot;, &quot;Norma Rae&quot;) have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically&quot; significant.

==Early years and influences==
Ritt was born to a Jewish family in Manhattan, the son of immigrant parents. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx.

Ritt originally attended and played football for Elon College in North Carolina. The stark contrasts of the depression-era South, against his New York City upbringing, instilled in him a passion for expressing the struggles of inequality, which is apparent in the films he directed.

===Early theatre===
After leaving St. John&#x27;s University, Ritt found work with a theater group, and began acting in plays. His first performance was as &quot;Crown&quot; in &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. After his performance drew favorable reviews, Ritt concluded that he could &quot;only be happy in the theater.&quot;

Ritt then went to work with the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s New Deal Works Progress Administration as a playwright for the Federal Theater Project, a federal government-funded theater support program. With work hard to find and the Depression in full effect, many WPA theater performers, directors, and writers became heavily influenced by the radical left and Communism, and Ritt was no exception. Years later, Ritt would state that he had never been a member of the Communist Party, although he considered himself a leftist and found common ground with some Marxist principles.

===Group Theatre===
Ritt moved on from the WPA to the Theater of Arts, then to the Group Theatre in New York City. There, he met Elia Kazan, who cast Ritt as an understudy to his play &quot;Golden Boy&quot;. Ritt continued his association with Kazan for well over a decade, later assisting—and sometimes filling in for—Kazan at The Actors Studio. He eventually became one of the Studio&#x27;s few non-performing life members.

===World War II===
During World War II, Ritt served with the U.S. Army Air Forces and appeared as an actor in the Air Forces&#x27; Broadway play and film &quot;Winged Victory&quot;.

During the Broadway run of the play, Ritt directed a production of Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s play &quot;Yellow Jack&quot;, using actors from &quot;Winged Victory&quot; and rehearsing between midnight and 3 am after &quot;Winged Victory&quot; performances.

The play had a brief Broadway run and was performed again in Los Angeles when the &quot;Winged Victory&quot; troupe moved there to make the film version.

==Television and the Blacklist==
After working as a playwright with the WPA, acting on stage, and directing hundreds of plays, Ritt became a successful television director and producer. He produced and directed episodes of &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;Somerset Maugham TV Theatre&quot; (1950–51), &quot;Starlight Theatre&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Plymouth Playhouse&quot; (1953).

===Blacklist===
In 1952, Ritt was caught up by the Red Scare and investigations of communist influence in Hollywood and the movie industry. Although not directly named by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), Ritt was mentioned in an anticommunist newsletter called &quot;Counterattack&quot;, published by American Business Consultants, a group formed by three former FBI agents.

&quot;Counterattack&quot; alleged that Ritt had helped Communist Party-affiliated locals of the New York-based Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union stage their annual show. Also cited was a show he had directed for Russian War Relief at Madison Square Garden. His associations with the Group Theater, founded on a Russian model, and the Federal Theater Project (which Congress had stopped funding in 1939 because of what some anti-New Deal congressmen claimed to be a left-wing political tone to some productions), were also known to HUAC. He was finally blacklisted by the television industry when a Syracuse grocer charged him with donating money to Communist China in 1951. He supported himself for five years by teaching at the Actors Studio.

==Career in Hollywood==
===&quot;Edge of the City&quot;===
Unable to work in the television industry, Ritt returned to the theater for several years. By 1956, the Red Scare had decreased in intensity, and he turned to film directing. His first film as director was &quot;Edge of the City&quot; (1957), an important film for Ritt and an opportunity to give voice to his experiences. Based on the story of a union dock worker who faces intimidation by a corrupt boss, the film incorporates many themes that were to influence Ritt over the years: corruption, racism, intimidation of the individual by the group, defense of the individual against government oppression, and most notably, the redeeming quality of mercy and the value of shielding others from evil, even at the cost of sacrificing one&#x27;s own reputation, career, or life.

===Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman===
Ritt went on to direct 25 more films. Producer Jerry Wald signed him to direct &quot;No Down Payment&quot; (1957) with Joanne Woodward. Wald later used Ritt on two adaptations of William Faulkner novels, both with Woodward: &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot; (1958) with Paul Newman, a big hit, and &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1959) with Yul Brynner, a flop.

In between, he directed &quot;The Black Orchid&quot; (1958) at Paramount, and he then did &quot;5 Branded Women&quot; (1960) in Europe.

Ritt directed &quot;Paris Blues&quot; (1961) with Woodward and Newman. He made one more film with Wald, &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s Adventures of a Young Man&quot; (1962).

Ritt and Newman had a big hit with &quot;Hud&quot; (1963).

Ritt&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;The Outrage&quot; is an American retelling of the Kurosawa film &quot;Rashomon&quot;, and stars Laurence Harvey, Paul Newman, Claire Bloom, Edward G. Robinson, Howard da Silva, and William Shatner. Like Kurosawa&#x27;s film, Ritt employs flashbacks in his film. Paul Newman was fond of this role. He traveled to Mexico and spent time speaking to local residents to study the accents. Newman liked that the film&#x27;s narrative included different points of view.

Ritt directed &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1965) with Richard Burton, then one more movie with Newman, &quot;Hombre&quot; (1967). He ended the &#x27;60s with &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; (1968).

===1970s===

In the 1970s, Ritt won acclaim for movies such as &quot;The Molly Maguires&quot; (1970), &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; (1970) (earning Oscar nominations for James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander), &quot;Sounder&quot; (1972), &quot;Pete &#x27;n&#x27; Tillie&quot; (1972), and &quot;Conrack&quot; (1974) (from Pat Conroy&#x27;s autobiographical novel).

After Warner Bros. Pictures brought the film rights to &quot;First Blood&quot; in 1973 Ritt was hired to direct from a screenplay by Walter Newman, featuring Paul Newman as John Rambo and Robert Mitchum as Sheriff Will Teasle. However his version of the film was not made.

In 1976, Ritt made one of the first dramatic feature films about the blacklist, &quot;The Front&quot;, starring Woody Allen. &quot;The Front&quot; satirizes the use of &quot;fronts&quot;, men and women who (either as a personal favor or in exchange for payment) allowed their names to be listed as writers for scripts actually authored by blacklisted writers. The film was based on the experiences of, and written by, one of Ritt&#x27;s closest friends, screenwriter Walter Bernstein, who was blacklisted for eight years beginning in 1950.

Ritt ended the decade with &quot;Casey&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1978) and &quot;Norma Rae&quot; (1979) (Oscar for Sally Field as Best Actress).

===Final Films===

Ritt made &quot;Back Roads&quot; (1981) with Sally Field, and &quot;Cross Creek&quot; (1983), the story of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, author of &quot;The Yearling&quot;. It was nominated for (but did not win) four Oscars, including Best Supporting Actress Alfre Woodard and Best Supporting Actor Rip Torn. He directed &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot; (1985), also starring Field.

In 1987, Ritt again used extensive flashback and nonlinear storytelling techniques in the film &quot;Nuts&quot;, based on the stage play of the same name, written by Tom Topor. The film was considered a box-office disappointment in relation to its budget, although it did not actually lose money.

Ritt&#x27;s final film was &quot;Stanley &amp; Iris&quot; (1990).

== Personal life ==
Ritt and his wife Adele had a daughter, film producer Martina Wernerand, and a son, Michael.

Ritt died of heart disease at age 76 in Santa Monica, California, on December 8, 1990.

<doc id="623686" wikidata="Q897410" url="?curid=623686" title="Brain–computer interface">
<text>A brain–computer interface (BCI), sometimes called a brain–machine interface (BMI), is a direct communication link between the brain&#x27;s electrical activity and an external device, most commonly a computer or robotic limb. BCIs are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions. They are often conceptualized as a human–machine interface that skips the intermediary of moving body parts (e.g. hands or feet), although they also raise the possibility of erasing the distinction between brain and machine. BCI implementations range from non-invasive (EEG, MEG, MRI) and partially invasive (ECoG and endovascular) to invasive (microelectrode array), based on how physically close electrodes are to brain tissue.

Research on BCIs began in the 1970s by Jacques Vidal at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under a grant from the National Science Foundation, followed by a contract from the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Vidal&#x27;s 1973 paper introduced the expression &quot;brain–computer interface&quot; into scientific literature.

Due to the cortical plasticity of the brain, signals from implanted prostheses can, after adaptation, be handled by the brain like natural sensor or effector channels. Following years of animal experimentation, the first neuroprosthetic devices were implanted in humans in the mid-1990s.

==History==
The history of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) starts with Hans Berger&#x27;s discovery of the brain&#x27;s electrical activity and the development of electroencephalography (EEG). In 1924 Berger was the first to record human brain activity utilizing EEG. Berger was able to identify oscillatory activity, such as the alpha wave (8–13 Hz), by analyzing EEG traces.

Berger&#x27;s first recording device was rudimentary. He inserted silver wires under the scalps of his patients. These were later replaced by silver foils attached to the patient&#x27;s head by rubber bandages. Berger connected these sensors to a Lippmann capillary electrometer, with disappointing results. However, more sophisticated measuring devices, such as the Siemens double-coil recording galvanometer, which displayed voltages as small as 10−4 volt, led to success.

Berger analyzed the interrelation of alternations in his EEG wave diagrams with brain diseases. EEGs permitted completely new possibilities for brain research.

Although the term had not yet been coined, one of the earliest examples of a working brain-machine interface was the piece &quot;Music for Solo Performer&quot; (1965) by American composer Alvin Lucier. The piece makes use of EEG and analog signal processing hardware (filters, amplifiers, and a mixing board) to stimulate acoustic percussion instruments. Performing the piece requires producing alpha waves and thereby &quot;playing&quot; the various instruments via loudspeakers that are placed near or directly on the instruments.

Vidal coined the term &quot;BCI&quot; and produced the first peer-reviewed publications on this topic. He is widely recognized as the inventor of BCIs. A review pointed out that Vidal&#x27;s 1973 paper stated the &quot;BCI challenge&quot; of controlling external objects using EEG signals, and especially use of Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) potential as a challenge for BCI control. Vidal&#x27;s 1977 experiment was the first application of BCI after his 1973 BCI challenge. It was a noninvasive EEG (actually Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP)) control of a cursor-like graphical object on a computer screen. The demonstration was movement in a maze.

1988 was the first demonstration of noninvasive EEG control of a physical object, a robot. The experiment demonstrated EEG control of multiple start-stop-restart cycles of movement, along an arbitrary trajectory defined by a line drawn on a floor. The line-following behavior was the default robot behavior, utilizing autonomous intelligence and an autonomous energy source.

In 1990, a report was given on a closed loop, bidirectional, adaptive BCI controlling a computer buzzer by an anticipatory brain potential, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) potential. The experiment described how an expectation state of the brain, manifested by CNV, used a feedback loop to control the S2 buzzer in the S1-S2-CNV paradigm. The resulting cognitive wave representing the expectation learning in the brain was termed Electroexpectogram (EXG). The CNV brain potential was part of Vidal&#x27;s 1973 challenge.

Studies in the 2010s suggested neural stimulation&#x27;s potential to restore functional connectivity and associated behaviors through modulation of molecular mechanisms. This opened the door for the concept that BCI technologies may be able to restore function.

Beginning in 2013, DARPA funded BCI technology through the BRAIN initiative, which supported work out of teams including University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Paradromics, Brown, and Synchron.

==Neuroprosthetics==
Neuroprosthetics is an area of neuroscience concerned with neural prostheses, that is, using artificial devices to replace the function of impaired nervous systems and brain-related problems, or of sensory or other organs (bladder, diaphragm, etc.). As of December 2010, cochlear implants had been implanted as neuroprosthetic devices in some 736,900 people worldwide. Other neuroprosthetic devices aim to restore vision, including retinal implants. The first neuroprosthetic device, however, was the pacemaker.

The terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Neuroprosthetics and BCIs seek to achieve the same aims, such as restoring sight, hearing, movement, ability to communicate, and even cognitive function. Both use similar experimental methods and surgical techniques.

==Animal research==

Several laboratories have managed to read signals from monkey and rat cerebral cortices to operate BCIs to produce movement. Monkeys have moved computer cursors and commanded robotic arms to perform simple tasks simply by thinking about the task and seeing the results, without motor output. In May 2008 photographs that showed a monkey at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center operating a robotic arm by thinking were published in multiple studies. Sheep have also been used to evaluate BCI technology including Synchron&#x27;s Stentrode.

In 2020, Elon Musk&#x27;s Neuralink was successfully implanted in a pig. In 2021, Musk announced that the company had successfully enabled a monkey to play video games using Neuralink&#x27;s device.

===Early work===

In 1969 operant conditioning studies by Fetz et al. at the Regional Primate Research Center and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington School of Medicine showed that monkeys could learn to control the deflection of a biofeedback arm with neural activity. Similar work in the 1970s established that monkeys could learn to control the firing rates of individual and multiple neurons in the primary motor cortex if they were rewarded accordingly.

Algorithms to reconstruct movements from motor cortex neurons, which control movement, date back to the 1970s. In the 1980s, Georgopoulos at Johns Hopkins University found a mathematical relationship between the electrical responses of single motor cortex neurons in rhesus macaque monkeys and the direction in which they moved their arms. He also found that dispersed groups of neurons, in different areas of the monkey&#x27;s brains, collectively controlled motor commands. He was able to record the firings of neurons in only one area at a time, due to equipment limitations.

Several groups have been able to capture complex brain motor cortex signals by recording from neural ensembles (groups of neurons) and using these to control external devices.

===Research ===

====Kennedy and Yang Dan====
Phillip Kennedy (Neural Signals founder (1987) and colleagues built the first intracortical brain–computer interface by implanting neurotrophic-cone electrodes into monkeys.In 1999, Yang Dan et al. at University of California, Berkeley decoded neuronal firings to reproduce images from cats. The team used an array of electrodes embedded in the thalamus (which integrates the brain&#x27;s sensory input). Researchers targeted 177 brain cells in the thalamus lateral geniculate nucleus area, which decodes signals from the retina. Neuron firings were recorded from watching eight short movies. Using mathematical filters, the researchers decoded the signals to reconstruct recognizable scenes and moving objects.

====Nicolelis====

Duke University professor Miguel Nicolelis advocates using multiple electrodes spread over a greater area of the brain to obtain neuronal signals.

After initial studies in rats during the 1990s, Nicolelis and colleagues developed BCIs that decoded brain activity in owl monkeys and used the devices to reproduce monkey movements in robotic arms. Monkeys&#x27; advanced reaching and grasping abilities and hand manipulation skills, made them good test subjects.

By 2000, the group succeeded in building a BCI that reproduced owl monkey movements while the monkey operated a joystick or reached for food. The BCI operated in real time and could remotely control a separate robot. But the monkeys received no feedback (open-loop BCI).

Later experiments on rhesus monkeys included feedback and reproduced monkey reaching and grasping movements in a robot arm. Their deeply cleft and furrowed brains made them better models for human neurophysiology than owl monkeys. The monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects on a computer screen by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a robot arm were hidden. The monkeys were later shown the robot and learned to control it by viewing its movements. The BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted gripping force. 

In 2011 O&#x27;Doherty and colleagues showed a BCI with sensory feedback with rhesus monkeys. The monkey controlled the position of an avatar arm while receiving sensory feedback through direct intracortical stimulation (ICMS) in the arm representation area of the sensory cortex.

====Donoghue, Schwartz, and Andersen====

Other laboratories that have developed BCIs and algorithms that decode neuron signals include John Donoghue at the Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown University, Andrew Schwartz at the University of Pittsburgh, and Richard Andersen at Caltech. These researchers produced working BCIs using recorded signals from far fewer neurons than Nicolelis (15–30 neurons versus 50–200 neurons).

The Carney Institute reported training rhesus monkeys to use a BCI to track visual targets on a computer screen (closed-loop BCI) with or without a joystick. The group created a BCI for three-dimensional tracking in virtual reality and reproduced BCI control in a robotic arm. The same group demonstrated that a monkey could feed itself pieces of fruit and marshmallows using a robotic arm controlled by the animal&#x27;s brain signals.

Andersen&#x27;s group used recordings of premovement activity from the posterior parietal cortex, including signals created when experimental animals anticipated receiving a reward.

====Other research====
In addition to predicting kinematic and kinetic parameters of limb movements, BCIs that predict electromyographic or electrical activity of the muscles of primates are in process. Such BCIs could restore mobility in paralyzed limbs by electrically stimulating muscles.

Nicolelis and colleagues demonstrated that large neural ensembles can predict arm position. This work allowed BCIs to read arm movement intentions and translate them into actuator movements. Carmena and colleagues programmed a BCI that allowed a monkey to control reaching and grasping movements by a robotic arm. Lebedev and colleagues argued that brain networks reorganize to create a new representation of the robotic appendage in addition to the representation of the animal&#x27;s own limbs.

In 2019, a study reported a BCI that had the potential to help patients with speech impairment caused by neurological disorders. Their BCI used high-density electrocorticography to tap neural activity from a patient&#x27;s brain and used deep learning to synthesize speech. In 2021, those researchers reported the potential of a BCI to decode words and sentences in an anarthric patient who had been unable to speak for over 15 years.

The biggest impediment to BCI technology is the lack of a sensor modality that provides safe, accurate and robust access to brain signals. The use of a better sensor expands the range of communication functions that can be provided using a BCI.

Development and implementation of a BCI system is complex and time-consuming. In response to this problem, Gerwin Schalk has been developing BCI2000, a general-purpose system for BCI research, since 2000.

A new &#x27;wireless&#x27; approach uses light-gated ion channels such as channelrhodopsin to control the activity of genetically defined subsets of neurons &quot;in vivo&quot;. In the context of a simple learning task, illumination of transfected cells in the somatosensory cortex influenced decision-making in mice.

BCIs led to a deeper understanding of neural networks and the central nervous system. Research has reported that despite neuroscientists&#x27; inclination to believe that neurons have the most effect when working together, single neurons can be conditioned through the use of BCIs to fire in a pattern that allows primates to control motor outputs. BCIs led to development of the single neuron insufficiency principle that states that even with a well-tuned firing rate, single neurons can only carry limited information and therefore the highest level of accuracy is achieved by recording ensemble firings. Other principles discovered with BCIs include the neuronal multitasking principle, the neuronal mass principle, the neural degeneracy principle, and the plasticity principle.

BCIs are proposed to be applied by users without disabilities. Passive BCIs allow for assessing and interpreting changes in the user state during Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In a secondary, implicit control loop, the system adapts to its user, improving its usability.

BCI systems can potentially be used to encode signals from the periphery. These sensory BCI devices enable real-time, behaviorally-relevant decisions based upon closed-loop neural stimulation.

====The BCI Award====
The BCI Research Award is awarded annually in recognition of innovative research. Each year, a renowned research laboratory is asked to judge projects. The jury consists of BCI experts recruited by that laboratory. The jury selects twelve nominees, then chooses a first, second, and third-place winner, who receive awards of $3,000, $2,000, and $1,000, respectively.

==Human research==

===Invasive BCIs===
Invasive BCI requires surgery to implant electrodes under the scalp for accessing brain signals. The main advantage is to increase accuracy. Downsides include side effects from the surgery, including scar tissue that can obstruct brain signals, or the body potentially rejecting the implanted electrodes.

==== Vision ====
Invasive BCI research has targeted repairing damaged sight and providing new functionality for people with paralysis. Invasive BCIs are implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain during neurosurgery. Because they lie in the grey matter, invasive devices produce the highest quality signals of BCI devices but are prone to scar-tissue build-up, causing the signal to weaken, or disappear, as the body reacts to the foreign object.

In vision science, direct brain implants have been used to treat non-congenital (acquired) blindness. One of the first scientists to produce a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher William Dobelle. Dobelle&#x27;s first prototype was implanted into &quot;Jerry&quot;, a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry&#x27;s visual cortex and succeeded in producing phosphenes, the sensation of seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be hooked up to a mainframe computer, but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.

In 2002, Jens Naumann, also blinded in adulthood, became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle&#x27;s second generation implant, one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call &quot;the starry-night effect&quot;. Immediately after his implant, Jens was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive an automobile slowly around the parking area of the research institute. Dobelle died in 2004 before his processes and developments were documented, leaving no one to continue his work. Subsequently, Naumann and the other patients in the program began having problems with their vision, and eventually lost their &quot;sight&quot; again.

====Movement====
BCIs focusing on motor neuroprosthetics aim to restore movement in individuals with paralysis or provide devices to assist them, such as interfaces with computers or robot arms.

Kennedy and Bakay were first to install a human brain implant that produced signals of high enough quality to simulate movement. Their patient, Johnny Ray (1944–2002), developed &#x27;locked-in syndrome&#x27; after a brain-stem stroke in 1997. Ray&#x27;s implant was installed in 1998 and he lived long enough to start working with the implant, eventually learning to control a computer cursor; he died in 2002 of a brain aneurysm.

Tetraplegic Matt Nagle became the first person to control an artificial hand using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of Cyberkinetics&#x27;s BrainGate chip-implant. Implanted in Nagle&#x27;s right precentral gyrus (area of the motor cortex for arm movement), the 96-electrode implant allowed Nagle to control a robotic arm by thinking about moving his hand as well as a computer cursor, lights and TV. One year later, Jonathan Wolpaw received the Altran Foundation for Innovation prize for developing a Brain Computer Interface with electrodes located on the surface of the skull, instead of directly in the brain.

Research teams led by the BrainGate group and another at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, both in collaborations with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), demonstrated control of prosthetic limbs with many degrees of freedom using direct connections to arrays of neurons in the motor cortex of tetraplegia patients.

====Communication====
In May 2021, a Stanford University team reported a successful proof-of-concept test that enabled a quadraplegic participant to produce English sentences at about 86 characters per minute and 18 words per minute. The participant imagined moving his hand to write letters, and the system performed handwriting recognition on electrical signals detected in the motor cortex, utilizing Hidden Markov models and recurrent neural networks.

A 2021 study reported that a paralyzed patient was able to communicate 15 words per minute using a brain implant that analyzed vocal tract motor neurons.

In a review article, authors wondered whether human information transfer rates can surpass that of language with BCIs. Language research has reported that information transfer rates are relatively constant across many languages. This may reflect the brain&#x27;s information processing limit. Alternatively, this limit may be intrinsic to language itself, as a modality for information transfer.

In 2023 two studies used BCIs with recurrent neural network to decode speech at a record rate of 62 words per minute and 78 words per minute.

==== Technical challenges ====
There exist a number of technical challenges to recording brain activity with invasive BCIs. Advances in CMOS technology are pushing and enabling integrated, invasive BCI designs with smaller size, lower power requirements, and higher signal acquisition capabilities. Invasive BCIs involve electrodes that penetrate brain tissue in an attempt to record action potential signals (also known as spikes) from individual, or small groups of, neurons near the electrode. The interface between a recording electrode and the electrolytic solution surrounding neurons has been modelled using the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

Electronic limitations to invasive BCIs have been an active area of research in recent decades. While intracellular recordings of neurons reveal action potential voltages on the scale of hundreds of millivolts, chronic invasive BCIs rely on recording extracellular voltages which typically are three orders of magnitude smaller, existing at hundreds of microvolts. Further adding to the challenge of detecting signals on the scale of microvolts is the fact that the electrode-tissue interface has a high capacitance at small voltages. Due to the nature of these small signals, for BCI systems that incorporate functionality onto an integrated circuit, each electrode requires its own amplifier and ADC, which convert analog extracellular voltages into digital signals. Because a typical neuron action potential lasts for one millisecond, BCIs measuring spikes must have sampling rates ranging from 300 Hz to 5 kHz. Yet another concern is that invasive BCIs must be low-power, so as to dissipate less heat to surrounding tissue; at the most basic level more power is traditionally needed to optimize signal-to-noise ratio. Optimal battery design is an active area of research in BCIs.Challenges existing in the area of material science are central to the design of invasive BCIs. Variations in signal quality over time have been commonly observed with implantable microelectrodes. Optimal material and mechanical characteristics for long term signal stability in invasive BCIs has been an active area of research. It has been proposed that the formation of glial scarring, secondary to damage at the electrode-tissue interface, is likely responsible for electrode failure and reduced recording performance. Research has suggested that blood-brain barrier leakage, either at the time of insertion or over time, may be responsible for the inflammatory and glial reaction to chronic microelectrodes implanted in the brain. As a result, flexible and tissue-like designs have been researched and developed to minimize foreign-body reaction by means of matching the Young&#x27;s modulus of the electrode closer to that of brain tissue.

===Partially invasive BCIs===
Partially invasive BCI devices are implanted inside the skull but rest outside the brain rather than within the grey matter. They produce higher resolution signals than non-invasive BCIs where the bone tissue of the cranium deflects and deforms signals and have a lower risk of forming scar-tissue in the brain than fully invasive BCIs. Preclinical demonstration of intracortical BCIs from the stroke perilesional cortex has been conducted.

====Endovascular====
A systematic review published in 2020 detailed multiple clinical and non-clinical studies investigating the feasibility of endovascular BCIs.

In 2010, researchers affiliated with University of Melbourne began developing a BCI that could be inserted via the vascular system. Australian neurologist Thomas Oxley conceived the idea for this BCI, called Stentrode, earning funding from DARPA. Preclinical studies evaluated the technology in sheep.

Stentrode is a monolithic stent electrode array designed to be delivered via an intravenous catheter under image-guidance to the superior sagittal sinus, in the region which lies adjacent to the motor cortex. This proximity enables Stentrode to measure neural activity. The procedure is most similar to how venous sinus stents are placed for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Stentrode communicates neural activity to a battery-less telemetry unit implanted in the chest, which communicates wirelessly with an external telemetry unit capable of power and data transfer. While an endovascular BCI benefits from avoiding a craniotomy for insertion, risks such as clotting and venous thrombosis exist.

Human trials with Stentrode were underway as of 2021. In November 2020, two participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were able to wirelessly control an operating system to text, email, shop, and bank using direct thought using Stentrode, marking the first time a brain-computer interface was implanted via the patient&#x27;s blood vessels, eliminating the need for brain surgery. In January 2023, researchers reported no serious adverse events during the first year for all four patients, who could use it to operate computers.

==== Electrocorticography ====
Electrocorticography (ECoG) measures brain electrical activity from beneath the skull in a way similar to non-invasive electroencephalography, using electrodes embedded in a thin plastic pad placed above the cortex, beneath the dura mater. ECoG technologies were first trialled in humans in 2004 by Eric Leuthardt and Daniel Moran from Washington University in St. Louis. In a later trial, the researchers enabled a teenage boy to play Space Invaders. This research indicates that control is rapid, requires minimal training, balancing signal fidelity and level of invasiveness.

Signals can be either subdural or epidural, but are not taken from within the brain parenchyma. Patients are required to have invasive monitoring for localization and resection of an epileptogenic focus.

ECoG offers higher spatial resolution, better signal-to-noise ratio, wider frequency range, and less training requirements than scalp-recorded EEG, and at the same time has lower technical difficulty, lower clinical risk, and may have superior long-term stability than intracortical single-neuron recording. This feature profile and evidence of the high level of control with minimal training requirements shows potential for real world application for people with motor disabilities. 

Edward Chang and Joseph Makin from UCSF reported that ECoG signals could be used to decode speech from epilepsy patients implanted with high-density ECoG arrays over the peri-Sylvian cortices. They reported word error rates of 3% (a marked improvement from prior efforts) utilizing an encoder-decoder neural network, which translated ECoG data into one of fifty sentences composed of 250 unique words.

===Non-invasive BCIs===
Human experiments have used non-invasive neuroimaging interfaces. The majority of published BCI research involves noninvasive EEG-based BCIs. EEG-based technologies and interfaces have been used for the broadest variety of applications. Although EEG-based interfaces are easy to wear and do not require surgery, they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot effectively use higher-frequency signals because the skull interferes, dispersing and blurring the electromagnetic waves created by the neurons. EEG-based interfaces also require some time and effort prior to each usage session, while others require no prior-usage training. The choice of a specific BCI for a patient depends on numerous factors.

====Functional near-infrared spectroscopy====
In 2014, a BCI using functional near-infrared spectroscopy for &quot;locked-in&quot; patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was able to restore basic ability to communicate.

====Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces====

After Vidal stated the BCI challenge, the initial reports on non-invasive approaches included control of a cursor in 2D using VEP, control of a buzzer using CNV, control of a physical object, a robot, using a brain rhythm (alpha), control of a text written on a screen using P300.

In the early days of BCI research, another substantial barrier to using EEG was that extensive training was required. For example, in experiments beginning in the mid-1990s, Niels Birbaumer at the University of Tübingen in Germany trained paralysed people to self-regulate the slow cortical potentials in their EEG to such an extent that these signals could be used as a binary signal to control a computer cursor. (Birbaumer had earlier trained epileptics to prevent impending fits by controlling this low voltage wave.) The experiment trained ten patients to move a computer cursor. The process was slow, requiring more than an hour for patients to write 100 characters with the cursor, while training often took months. The slow cortical potential approach has fallen away in favor of approaches that require little or no training, are faster and more accurate, and work for a greater proportion of users.

Another research parameter is the type of oscillatory activity that is measured. Gert Pfurtscheller founded the BCI Lab 1991 and conducted the first online BCI based on oscillatory features and classifiers. Together with Birbaumer and Jonathan Wolpaw at New York State University they focused on developing technology that would allow users to choose the brain signals they found easiest to operate a BCI, including &quot;mu&quot; and &quot;beta&quot; rhythms.

A further parameter is the method of feedback used as shown in studies of P300 signals. Patterns of P300 waves are generated involuntarily (stimulus-feedback) when people see something they recognize and may allow BCIs to decode categories of thoughts without training.

A 2005 study reported EEG emulation of digital control circuits, using a CNV flip-flop. A 2009 study reported noninvasive EEG control of a robotic arm using a CNV flip-flop. A 2011 study reported control of two robotic arms solving Tower of Hanoi task with three disks using a CNV flip-flop. A 2015 study described EEG-emulation of a Schmitt trigger, flip-flop, demultiplexer, and modem.

Advances by Bin He and his team at University of Minnesota suggest the potential of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces to accomplish tasks close to invasive brain-computer interfaces. Using advanced functional neuroimaging including BOLD functional MRI and EEG source imaging, They identified the co-variation and co-localization of electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals. Refined by a neuroimaging approach and a training protocol, They fashioned a non-invasive EEG based brain-computer interface to control the flight of a virtual helicopter in 3-dimensional space, based upon motor imagination. In June 2013 they announced a technique to guide a remote-control helicopter through an obstacle course. They also solved the EEG inverse problem and then used the resulting virtual EEG for BCI tasks. Well-controlled studies suggested the merits of such a source analysis-based BCI.

A 2014 study reported that severely motor-impaired patients could communicate faster and more reliably with non-invasive EEG BCI than with muscle-based communication channels.

A 2019 study reported that the application of evolutionary algorithms could improve EEG mental state classification with a non-invasive Muse device, enabling classification of data acquired by a consumer-grade sensing device.

In a 2021 systematic review of randomized controlled trials using BCI for post-stroke upper-limb rehabilitation, EEG-based BCI was reported to have efficacy in improving upper-limb motor function compared to control therapies. More specifically, BCI studies that utilized band power features, motor imagery, and functional electrical stimulation were reported to be more effective than alternatives. Another 2021 systematic review focused on post-stroke robot-assisted EEG-based BCI for hand rehabilitation. Improvement in motor assessment scores was observed in three of eleven studies.

====Dry active electrode arrays====
In the early 1990s Babak Taheri, at University of California, Davis demonstrated the first single and multichannel dry active electrode arrays. The arrayed electrode was demonstrated to perform well compared to silver/silver chloride electrodes. The device consisted of four sensor sites with integrated electronics to reduce noise by impedance matching. The advantages of such electrodes are:

* no electrolyte used,
* no skin preparation,
* significantly reduced sensor size,
* compatibility with EEG monitoring systems.

The active electrode array is an integrated system containing an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry packaged with batteries to power the circuitry. This level of integration was required to achieve the result.

The electrode was tested on a test bench and on human subjects in four modalities, namely:

* spontaneous EEG,
* sensory event-related potentials,
* brain stem potentials,
* cognitive event-related potentials.

Performance compared favorably with that of standard wet electrodes in terms of skin preparation, no gel requirements (dry), and higher signal-to-noise ratio.

In 1999 Hunter Peckham and others at Case Western Reserve University used a 64-electrode EEG skullcap to return limited hand movements to a quadriplegic. As he concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down. A basic pattern was identified in his beta-rhythm EEG output and used to control a switch: Above average activity was interpreted as on, below average off. The signals were also used to drive nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring some movement.

==== SSVEP mobile EEG BCIs ====
In 2009, the NCTU Brain-Computer-Interface-headband was announced. Those researchers also engineered silicon-based microelectro-mechanical system (MEMS) dry electrodes designed for application to non-hairy body sites. These electrodes were secured to the headband&#x27;s DAQ board with snap-on electrode holders. The signal processing module measured alpha activity and transferred it over Bluetooth to a phone that assessed the patients&#x27; alertness and cognitive capacity. When the subject became drowsy, the phone sent arousing feedback to the operator to rouse them.

In 2011, researchers reported a cellular based BCI that could cause a phone to ring. The wearable system was composed of a four channel bio-signal acquisition/amplification module, a communication module, and a Bluetooth phone. The electrodes were placed to pick up steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). SSVEPs are electrical responses to flickering visual stimuli with repetition rates over 6 Hz that are best found in the parietal and occipital scalp regions of the visual cortex. It was reported that all study participants were able to initiate the phone call with minimal practice in natural environments.

The scientists reported that a single channel fast Fourier transform (FFT) and multiple channel system canonical correlation analysis (CCA) algorithm can support mobile BCIs. The CCA algorithm has been applied in experiments investigating BCIs with claimed high accuracy and speed. Cellular BCI technology can reportedly be translated for other applications, such as picking up sensorimotor mu/beta rhythms to function as a motor-imagery based BCI.

In 2013, comparative tests performed on Android cell phone, tablet, and computer based BCIs, analyzed the power spectrum density of resultant EEG SSVEPs. The stated goals of this study were to &quot;increase the practicability, portability, and ubiquity of an SSVEP-based BCI, for daily use&quot;. It was reported that the stimulation frequency on all mediums was accurate, although the phone&#x27;s signal was not stable. The amplitudes of the SSVEPs for the laptop and tablet were reported to be larger than those of the cell phone. These two qualitative characterizations were suggested as indicators of the feasibility of using a mobile stimulus BCI.

One of the difficulties with EEG readings is susceptibility to motion artifacts. In most research projects, the participants were asked to sit still in a laboratory setting, reducing head and eye movements as much as possible. However, since these initiatives were intended to create a mobile device for daily use, the technology had to be tested in motion. In 2013, researchers tested mobile EEG-based BCI technology, measuring SSVEPs from participants as they walked on a treadmill. Reported results were that as speed increased, SSVEP detectability using CCA decreased. Independent component analysis (ICA) had been shown to be efficient in separating EEG signals from noise. The researchers stated that CCA data with and without ICA processing were similar. They concluded that CCA demonstrated robustness to motion artifacts. EEG-based BCI applications offer low spatial resolution. Possible solutions include: EEG source connectivity based on graph theory, EEG pattern recognition based on Topomap and EEG-fMRI fusion.

====Prosthesis and environment control====
Non-invasive BCIs have been applied to prosthetic upper and lower extremity devices in people with paralysis. For example, Gert Pfurtscheller of Graz University of Technology and colleagues demonstrated a BCI-controlled functional electrical stimulation system to restore upper extremity movements in a person with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury. Between 2012 and 2013, researchers at University of California, Irvine demonstrated for the first time that BCI technology can restore brain-controlled walking after spinal cord injury. In their study, a person with paraplegia operated a BCI-robotic gait orthosis to regain basic ambulation. In 2009 independent researcher Alex Blainey used the Emotiv EPOC to control a 5 axis robot arm. He made several demonstrations of mind controlled wheelchairs and home automation.

==== Magnetoencephalography and fMRI ====
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have both been used as non-invasive BCIs. In a widely reported experiment, fMRI allowed two users to play Pong in real-time by altering their haemodynamic response or brain blood flow through biofeedback.

fMRI measurements of haemodynamic responses in real time have also been used to control robot arms with a seven-second delay between thought and movement.

In 2008 research developed in the Advanced Telecommunications Research (ATR) Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, allowed researchers to reconstruct images from brain signals at a resolution of 10x10 pixels.

A 2011 study reported second-by-second reconstruction of videos watched by the study&#x27;s subjects, from fMRI data. This was achieved by creating a statistical model relating videos to brain activity. This model was then used to look up 100 one-second video segments, in a database of 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, matching visual patterns to brain activity recorded when subjects watched a video. These 100 one-second video extracts were then combined into a mash-up image that resembled the video.

====BCI control strategies in neurogaming====

=====Motor imagery=====

Motor imagery involves imagining the movement of body parts, activating the sensorimotor cortex, which modulates sensorimotor oscillations in the EEG. This can be detected by the BCI and used to infer user intent. Motor imagery typically requires training to acquire acceptable control. Training sessions typically consume hours over several days. Regardless of the duration of the training session, users are unable to master the control scheme. This results in very slow pace of the gameplay. Machine learning methods were used to compute a subject-specific model for detecting motor imagery performance. The top performing algorithm from BCI Competition IV in 2022 dataset 2 for motor imagery was the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern, developed by Ang et al. from A*STAR, Singapore.

=====Bio/neurofeedback for passive BCI designs=====
Biofeedback can be used to monitor a subject&#x27;s mental relaxation. In some cases, biofeedback does not match EEG, while parameters such as electromyography (EMG), galvanic skin resistance (GSR), and heart rate variability (HRV) can do so. Many biofeedback systems treat disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problems in children, teeth grinding, and chronic pain. EEG biofeedback systems typically monitor four brainwave bands (theta: 4–7 Hz, alpha:8–12 Hz, SMR: 12–15 Hz, beta: 15–18 Hz) and challenge the subject to control them. Passive BCI uses BCI to enrich human–machine interaction with information on the user&#x27;s mental state, for example, simulations that detect when users intend to push brakes during emergency vehicle braking. Game developers using passive BCIs understand that through repetition of game levels the user&#x27;s cognitive state adapts. During the first play of a given level, the player reacts differently than during subsequent plays: for example, the user is less surprised by an event that they expect.

=====Visual evoked potential (VEP)=====

A VEP is an electrical potential recorded after a subject is presented with a visual stimuli. The types of VEPs include SSVEPs and P300 potential.

Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) use potentials generated by exciting the retina, using visual stimuli modulated at certain frequencies. SSVEP stimuli are often formed from alternating checkerboard patterns and at times use flashing images. The frequency of the phase reversal of the stimulus used can be distinguished by EEG; this makes detection of SSVEP stimuli relatively easy. SSVEP is used within many BCI systems. This is due to several factors. The signal elicited is measurable in as large a population as the transient VEP and blink movement. Electrocardiographic artefacts do not affect the frequencies monitored. The SSVEP signal is robust; the topographic organization of the primary visual cortex is such that a broader area obtains afferents from the visual field&#x27;s central or fovial region. SSVEP comes with problems. As SSVEPs use flashing stimuli to infer user intent, the user must gaze at one of the flashing or iterating symbols in order to interact with the system. It is, therefore, likely that the symbols become irritating and uncomfortable during longer play sessions.

Another type of VEP is the P300 potential. This potential is a positive peak in the EEG that occurs roughly 300 ms after the appearance of a target stimulus (a stimulus for which the user is waiting or seeking) or oddball stimuli. P300 amplitude decreases as the target stimuli and the ignored stimuli grow more similar. P300 is thought to be related to a higher level attention process or an orienting response. Using P300 requires fewer training sessions. The first application to use it was the P300 matrix. Within this system, a subject chooses a letter from a 6 by 6 grid of letters and numbers. The rows and columns of the grid flashed sequentially and every time the selected &quot;choice letter&quot; was illuminated the user&#x27;s P300 was (potentially) elicited. However, the communication process, at approximately 17 characters per minute, was slow. P300 offers a discrete selection rather than continuous control. The advantage of P300 within games is that the player does not have to learn how to use a new control system, requiring only short training instances to learn gameplay mechanics and the basic BCI paradigm.

==== Non-brain-based human–computer interface (physiological computing) ====
Human-computer interaction can exploit other recording modalities, such as electrooculography and eye-tracking. These modalities do not record brain activity and therefore do not qualify as BCIs.

=====Electrooculography (EOG)=====
In 1989, a study reported control of a mobile robot by eye movement using electrooculography signals. A mobile robot was driven to a goal point using five EOG commands, interpreted as forward, backward, left, right, and stop.

=====Pupil-size oscillation=====
A 2016 article described a new non-EEG-based HCI that required no visual fixation, or ability to move the eyes. The interface is based on covert interest; directing attention to a chosen letter on a virtual keyboard, without the need to look directly at the letter. Each letter has its own (background) circle which micro-oscillates in brightness differently from the others. Letter selection is based on best fit between unintentional pupil-size oscillation and the background circle&#x27;s brightness oscillation pattern. Accuracy is additionally improved by the user&#x27;s mental rehearsal of the words &#x27;bright&#x27; and &#x27;dark&#x27; in synchrony with the brightness transitions of the letter&#x27;s circle.

===Brain-to-brain communication===
In the 1960s a researcher after training used EEG to create Morse code using alpha waves. On 27 February 2013 Miguel Nicolelis&#x27;s group at Duke University and IINN-ELS connected the brains of two rats, allowing them to share information, in the first-ever direct brain-to-brain interface.

Gerwin Schalk reported that ECoG signals can discriminate vowels and consonants embedded in spoken and imagined words, shedding light on the mechanisms associated with their production and could provide a basis for brain-based communication using imagined speech.

In 2002 Kevin Warwick had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system to the Internet. Warwick carried out a series of experiments. Electrodes were implanted into his wife&#x27;s nervous system, allowing them to conduct the first direct electronic communication experiment between the nervous systems of two humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers achieved brain-to-brain communication between participants at a distance using non-invasive technology attached to the participants&#x27; scalps. The words were encoded in binary streams by the cognitive motor input of the person sending the information. Pseudo-random bits of the information carried encoded words &quot;hola&quot; (&quot;hi&quot; in Spanish) and &quot;ciao&quot; (&quot;goodbye&quot; in Italian) and were transmitted mind-to-mind.

==Cell-culture BCIs==
Researchers have built devices to interface with neural cells and entire neural networks &quot;in vitro&quot;. Experiments on cultured neural tissue focused on building problem-solving networks, constructing basic computers and manipulating robotic devices. Research into techniques for stimulating and recording individual neurons grown on semiconductor chips is neuroelectronics or neurochips.

Development of the first neurochip was claimed by a Caltech team led by Jerome Pine and Michael Maher in 1997. The Caltech chip had room for 16 neurons.

In 2003 a team led by Theodore Berger, at the University of Southern California, worked on a neurochip designed to function as an artificial or prosthetic hippocampus. The neurochip was designed for rat brains. The hippocampus was chosen because it is thought to be the most structured and most studied part of the brain. Its function is to encode experiences for storage as long-term memories elsewhere in the brain.

In 2004 Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida used a culture of 25,000 neurons taken from a rat&#x27;s brain to fly a F-22 fighter jet aircraft simulator. After collection, the cortical neurons were cultured in a petri dish and reconnected themselves to form a living neural network. The cells were arranged over a grid of 60 electrodes and used to control the pitch and yaw functions of the simulator. The study&#x27;s focus was on understanding how the human brain performs and learns computational tasks at a cellular level.

==Collaborative BCIs==
The idea of combining/integrating brain signals from multiple individuals was introduced at Humanity+ @Caltech, in December 2010, by Adrian Stoica, who referred to the concept as multi-brain aggregation. A patent was applied for in 2012. Stoica&#x27;s first paper on the topic appeared in 2012, after the publication of his patent application.

== Ethical considerations==
BCIs present ethical questions, including concerns about privacy, autonomy, consent, and the consequences of merging human cognition with external devices. Exploring these ethical considerations highlights the complex interplay between advancing technology and preserving fundamental human rights and values. The concerns can be broadly categorized into user-centric issues and legal and social issues.

Concerns center on the safety and long-term effects on users. These include obtaining informed consent from individuals with communication difficulties, the impact on patients&#x27; and families&#x27; quality of life, health-related side effects, misuse of therapeutic applications, safety risks, and the non-reversible nature of some BCI-induced changes. Additionally, questions arise about access to maintenance, repair, and spare parts, particularly in the event of a company&#x27;s bankruptcy.

The legal and social aspects of BCIs complicate mainstream adoption. Concerns include issues of accountability and responsibility, such as claims that BCI influence overrides free will and control over actions, inaccurate translation of cognitive intentions, personality changes resulting from deep-brain stimulation, and the blurring of the line between human and machine. Other concerns involve the use of BCIs in advanced interrogation techniques, unauthorized access (&quot;brain hacking&quot;), social stratification through selective enhancement, privacy issues related to mind-reading, tracking and &quot;tagging&quot; systems, and the potential for mind, movement, and emotion control. Researchers have also theorized that BCIs could exacerbate existing social inequalities.

In their current form, most BCIs are more akin to corrective therapies that engage few of such ethical issues. Bioethics is well-equipped to address the challenges posed by BCI technologies, with Clausen suggesting in 2009 that &quot;BCIs pose ethical challenges, but these are conceptually similar to those that bioethicists have addressed for other realms of therapy.&quot; Haselager and colleagues highlighted the importance of managing expectations and value. Standard protocols can ensure ethically sound informed-consent procedures for locked-in patients.

The evolution of BCIs mirrors that of pharmaceutical science, which began as a means to address impairments and now enhances focus and reduces the need for sleep. As BCIs progress from therapies to enhancements, the BCI community is working to create consensus on ethical guidelines for research, development, and dissemination. Ensuring equitable access to BCIs will be crucial in preventing generational inequalities that could hinder the right to human flourishing.

==Low-cost systems==

==Future directions==

A consortium of 12 European partners completed a roadmap to support the European Commission in their funding decisions for the Horizon 2020 framework program. The project was funded by the European Commission. It started in November 2013 and published a roadmap in April 2015. A 2015 publication describes this project, as well as the Brain-Computer Interface Society. It reviewed work within this project that further defined BCIs and applications, explored recent trends, discussed ethical issues, and evaluated directions for new BCIs.

Other recent publications too have explored future BCI directions for new groups of disabled users.

===Disorders of consciousness (DOC)===
Some people have a disorder of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include people in a coma and those in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). BCI research seeks to address DOC. A key initial goal is to identify patients who can perform basic cognitive tasks, which would change their diagnosis, and allow them to make important decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Patients incorrectly diagnosed may die as a result of end-of-life decisions made by others. The prospect of using BCI to communicate with such patients is a tantalizing prospect.

Many such patients cannot use BCIs based on vision. Hence, tools must rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile stimuli. Patients may wear headphones and/or vibrotactile stimulators placed on responsive body parts. Another challenge is that patients may be able to communicate only at unpredictable intervals. Home devices can allow communications when the patient is ready. 

Automated tools can ask questions that patients can easily answer, such as &quot;Is your father named George?&quot; or &quot;Were you born in the USA?&quot; Automated instructions inform patients how to convey yes or no, for example by focusing their attention on stimuli on the right vs. left wrist. This focused attention produces reliable changes in EEG patterns that can help determine whether the patient is able to communicate.

===Motor recovery===
People may lose some of their ability to move due to many causes, such as stroke or injury. Research in recent years has demonstrated the utility of EEG-based BCI systems in aiding motor recovery and neurorehabilitation in patients who have had a stroke. Several groups have explored systems and methods for motor recovery that include BCIs. In this approach, a BCI measures motor activity while the patient imagines or attempts movements as directed by a therapist. The BCI may provide two benefits: (1) if the BCI indicates that a patient is not imagining a movement correctly (non-compliance), then the BCI could inform the patient and therapist; and (2) rewarding feedback such as functional stimulation or the movement of a virtual avatar also depends on the patient&#x27;s correct movement imagery.

So far, BCIs for motor recovery have relied on the EEG to measure the patient&#x27;s motor imagery. However, studies have also used fMRI to study different changes in the brain as persons undergo BCI-based stroke rehab training. Imaging studies combined with EEG-based BCI systems hold promise for investigating neuroplasticity during motor recovery post-stroke. Future systems might include the fMRI and other measures for real-time control, such as functional near-infrared, probably in tandem with EEGs. Non-invasive brain stimulation has also been explored in combination with BCIs for motor recovery. In 2016, scientists out of the University of Melbourne published preclinical proof-of-concept data related to a potential brain-computer interface technology platform being developed for patients with paralysis to facilitate control of external devices such as robotic limbs, computers and exoskeletons by translating brain activity.

===Functional brain mapping===
In 2014, some 400,000 people underwent brain mapping during neurosurgery. This procedure is often required for people who do not respond to medication. During this procedure, electrodes are placed on the brain to precisely identify the locations of structures and functional areas. Patients may be awake during neurosurgery and asked to perform tasks, such as moving fingers or repeating words. This is necessary so that surgeons can remove the desired tissue while sparing other regions. Removing too much brain tissue can cause permanent damage, while removing too little can mandate additional neurosurgery. 

Researchers explored ways to improve neurosurgical mapping. This work focuses largely on high gamma activity, which is difficult to detect non-invasively. Results improved methods for identifying key functional areas.

===Flexible devices===
Flexible electronics are polymers or other flexible materials (e.g. silk, pentacene, PDMS, Parylene, polyimide) printed with circuitry; the flexibility allows the electronics to bend. The fabrication techniques used to create these devices resembles those used to create integrated circuits and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). 

Flexible neural interfaces may minimize brain tissue trauma related to mechanical mismatch between electrode and tissue. 

===Neural dust===

Neural dust is millimeter-sized devices operated as wirelessly powered nerve sensors that were proposed in a 2011 paper from the University of California, Berkeley Wireless Research Center. In one model, local field potentials could be distinguished from action potential &quot;spikes&quot;, which would offer greatly diversified data vs conventional techniques.

<text>The American Sailboat Hall of Fame is a defunct hall of fame honoring 26 production sailboats built-in the United States. The hall of fame was established in 1994 by Sail America, a trade association for the U.S. sailing industry, to recognize ingenuity in designs by American boat builders. The last year of induction was 2004.

Half-hull models of each Hall of Fame inductee was housed in a permanent exhibit at The Museum of Yachting located in Fort Adams State Park in Newport, Rhode Island prior to the museum&#x27;s dismantling after a 2007 acquisition by the IYRS School of Technology &amp; Trades. The collection also traveled around the country each year to be displayed at the various Strictly Sail boat shows sponsored by Sail America, and at Sail Expo in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Inducted sailboats were required to be production models built in the U.S. introduced at least 15 years prior to induction, and to have made a lasting impact on sailing. Selections to the hall of fame were made by a committee composed of magazine editors of Sailing Magazine, Sailing World, and SAIL.

<text>The cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of the midbrain, aqueduct of Sylvius, Sylvian aqueduct, mesencephalic duct) is a small, narrow tube connecting the third and fourth ventricles of the brain. The cerebral aqueduct is a midline structure that passes through the midbrain. It extends rostrocaudally through the entirety of the more posterior part of the midbrain. It is surrounded by the periaqueductal gray (central gray), a layer of gray matter.

Congenital stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct is a cause of congenital hydrocephalus.

It is named for Franciscus Sylvius.

== Anatomy ==
The cerebral aqueduct is roughly circular in transverse section, and measures 1-2 mm in diameter. It is 15 mm long and is commonly subdivided into a pars anterior antrum, and pars posterior.

=== Relations ===
Rostrally, it is continuous with the third ventricle, commencing just inferior to the posterior commissure.

Caudally, it is continuous with the fourth ventricle at the junction of the mesencephalon and pons.

The midbrain tegmentum is situated anteriorly to the cerebral aqueduct. The portion of the tegmentum posterior to the aqueduct is the tectum. The superior and inferior colliculi that make up the corpora quadrigemina are situated posteriorly to it.

=== Development ===
The cerebral aqueduct, as other parts of the ventricular system of the brain, develops from the central canal of the neural tube, and it originates from the portion of the neural tube that is present in the developing mesencephalon, hence the name &quot;mesencephalic duct.&quot;

== Function ==

The cerebral aqueduct acts as a canal that passes through the midbrain. It connects the third ventricle with the fourth ventricle so that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) moves between the cerebral ventricles and the canal connecting these ventricles.

== Clinical significance ==
Aqueductal stenosis, a narrowing of the cerebral aqueduct, obstructs the flow of CSF and has been associated with non-communicating hydrocephalus. Such narrowing can be congenital, arise via tumor compression (e.g. pinealoblastoma), or through cyclical gliosis secondary to an initial partial obstruction.

== History ==
The cerebral aqueduct was first named after Franciscus Sylvius.

<text>Dytiscus (&quot;little diver&quot; based on Greek &quot;δυτικός&quot;, &quot;able to dive&quot; and the diminutive suffix &quot;-ίσκος&quot;) is a Holarctic genus of predaceous diving beetles that usually live in wetlands and ponds. There are 26 species in this genus distributed in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North and Central America. They are predators that can reduce mosquito larvae.

&quot;Dytiscus&quot; are large water beetles with a robust, rounded shape and they measure long depending on the exact species involved. The largest, &quot;D. latissimus&quot;, is among the largest species in the family and its size is only matched by certain &quot;Megadytes&quot;. The tarsi of the males are modified into suckers which are used to grip the female in mating. Females are usually larger than the males and come in two forms, with grooved (sulcate) or smooth elytra. Males only ever have smooth elytra. The adults of most species can fly.

==Life history==
Adult beetles and their larvae are aquatic but the pupae spend their life in the ground. Females lay eggs inside the tissue of aquatic plants such as reeds. The eggs hatch in about three weeks.

The larvae (known as &quot;water tigers&quot;) are elongate with a round and flat head and strong mandibles. They are predatory and their mandible have grooves on their inner edge through which they are able to suck the body fluids of their prey. The larvae take air from the surface of the water using hairs at the end of their abdomen. These lead to spiracles into which the air is taken.

Once the larvae grow to some size, they move to soil at the edge of water and burrow into a cell and pupate.

The adults breathe by going to the surface and upending. They collect air under their elytra and are able to breathe this collected air using spiracles hidden under the elytra.

In &quot;Dytiscus marginalis&quot; and other species the tarsus of the forelegs is modified in males to form a circular sucker. A reduced sucker is also seen in the midleg of the male.

==Parasitoids==
Eggs of &quot;Dytiscus&quot; are sometimes parasitized by wasps of the families Eulophidae, Mymaridae and other Chalcidoidea.

==Species==
&quot;Dysticus&quot; contains the following species:

* &quot;Dytiscus alaskanus&quot;

<doc id="623711" wikidata="Q860051" url="?curid=623711" title="Election Assistance Commission">
<text>The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is an independent agency of the United States government created by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). The Commission serves as a national clearinghouse and resource of information regarding election administration. It is charged with administering payments to states and developing guidance to meet HAVA requirements, adopting voluntary voting system guidelines, and accrediting voting system test laboratories and certifying voting equipment. It is also charged with developing and maintaining a national mail voter registration form.

==Responsibilities==
The EAC is tasked with performing a number of election-related duties including:
* creating and maintaining the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines
* creating a national program for the testing, certification, and decertification of voting systems
* maintaining the National Mail Voter Registration Form required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA)
* reporting to Congress every two years on the effects of the NVRA on elections
* administering federal funds to States for HAVA requirements
* administering federal funds for the development of innovative election technology, including pilot programs to test election technology
* studying and reporting best practices of effective administration
* communicating information on laws, technologies, procedures, studies, and data related to the administration of federal elections to those responsible for formulating or implementing election law and procedures, to the media, and to other interested persons

The HAVA requires the EAC will create voluntary guidelines for voting systems, maintaining a clearinghouse of information regarding election administration procedures including testing and certification of election equipment, and administering the Election Assistance and Help America Vote Programs.

The EAC publishes the Election Administration and Voting Survey, a study examining how states administer federal elections, every two years.

==History==
In 2003, Congress appropriated US$1.5 billion for HAVA. The General Services Administration distributed most of the $650 million permitted under Title I of HAVA, and the remainder was earmarked for the EAC to disburse. The funds were not distributed because the commissioners were not confirmed until December 9, 2003; the law had required that they be in place by February 26, 2003. The initial Commissioners were:
* DeForest Soaries Jr. (2003–2005)
* Ray Martinez, III (2003–2006)
* Paul S. DeGregorio (2003–2007)
* Gracia Hillman (2003–2010)

In its 2004 budget, Congress again allocated $1.5 billion to fund HAVA. By January 2004, the EAC did not have permanent offices or budget, even though it was required to publish state election reform plans in the Federal Register before money for new voting equipment could be disbursed to the states.

On December 6, 2006 Caroline Hunter and Rosemary E. Rodriguez were nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Ray Martinez and Paul DeGregorio. They were confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 15, 2007.

In 2010, the EAC lost its quorum of Commissioners, after the resignation or end of term of Hunter (2008), Rodriguez (2009) and Hillman (2010), preventing many normal operational duties; and was without any Commissioners by 2011 after the resignation of Davidson. Bills were subsequently drafted to end the Commission. Specifically, Representative Gregg Harper introduced a bill to windup the EAC and transfer some of its functions to the Federal Election Commission.

The EAC did not regain a quorum until December 16, 2014, when the U.S. Senate confirmed three Commissioners, Thomas Hicks, Matthew V. Masterson, and Christy McCormick. Masterson resigned in 2018; and on January 2, 2019, President Donald Trump&#x27;s nominees, Benjamin Hovland and Donald Palmer, were confirmed by the US Senate, and took office in February 2019.

==Chair and commissioners==
The Help America Vote Act specifies that four commissioners are nominated by the President on recommendations from the majority and minority leadership in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. Once confirmed by the full Senate, commissioners may serve two consecutive terms and no more than two commissioners may belong to the same political party. The terms lasts for four years, but commissioners may continue serving after the expiration of their term until their successor has taken office. The Commission selects a chair and vice chair from among its members for a term of one year. The chair and vice chair may not be affiliated with the same political party. A member of the Commission can only serve one term as chair and vice chair each during each of their terms as members.

(see a full list of TGDC members)

==Criticisms==

Critics have contended that the EAC has responded positively to political pressure from the Republican Party and the Department of Justice. For example, the EAC is said to have overstated the problem of voter fraud, which is often cited by Republicans as a justification for restrictive measures that Democrats charge are intended to prevent qualified Democrats from voting. The EAC Chair denied that there was any political pressure. Tova Wang, a consultant to the Commission, wrote a detailed account in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; about how her research and that of her Republican co-author had been disregarded or altered by the EAC, to produce a published report &quot;that completely stood our own work on its head.&quot; The changes included exaggerating the purported voter fraud issue and omitting references to charges of voter intimidation lodged by Democrats, as well as removing all criticisms of the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s Department of Justice that the report had incorporated.

In 2009, the United States Office of Special Counsel issued a report that found that the EAC engaged in political discrimination in federal hiring against an attorney to fill the General Counsel position because he was a Republican. The report was in response to a settlement between the attorney and the EAC, in which the attorney was paid an unspecified amount of money.

In 2019, an article in Politico reported that Newby had been the subject of extensive criticism from within and without the agency since his hiring in 2015, culminating in multiple calls for his resignation from Democratic members of the House and the Senate. Anonymous sources reported that Newby played a large role in many EAC staffers leaving, including the departure of Ryan Macias, the acting director of election testing and certification, as well as his predecessor, Brian Hancock. These departures &quot;knocked the wind out of the technical sails of the EAC,&quot; said an anonymous voting security researcher. Exacerbating the situation was the reporter&#x27;s speculation of the partisan nature of Newby&#x27;s hiring, with the article labeling him a Republican and the Commissioner who recommended his being hired, Christy McCormick, as well. In February 2016, Newby approved requests from three states to change state-specific instructions on the NVRA federal form related to proof of citizenship for voter registration. These states required proof of citizenship by state law, a controversial policy being pushed by conservative GOP members such as Kris Kobach of Kansas, that would be used in support of Donald Trump&#x27;s widely discredited claim that millions of illegal votes had been cast in the 2016 presidential election and had denied Trump a majority in the popular vote. An injunction was placed on the changes by a US Appeals court, although the case remained with the US District Court.

==Certification of voting machines==

The US Election Assistance Commission has assumed federal responsibility for accrediting voting system test laboratories and certifying voting equipment through the Voting System Certification &amp; Laboratory Accreditation Program. The purpose of the program is to independently verify that voting systems comply with the functional capabilities, accessibility, and security requirements necessary to ensure the integrity and reliability of voting system operation, as established in the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG). With this program the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will recommend labs for accreditation through its National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).

The VVSG provide a set of specifications and requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the systems provide all of the basic functionality, accessibility and security capabilities required of these systems. In addition, the guidelines establish evaluation criteria for the national certification of voting systems.

The EAC&#x27;s Technical Guidelines Development Committee, with technical support from NIST are tasked with developing an initial set of recommendations for each VVSG iteration. After the initial draft guidelines are authored, they are sent to the EAC for review and revision and then released for public comment. Comments are reviewed and considered by the EAC in consultation with NIST in development of the final release.

In 2007, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen decertified four electronic voting systems, three of which were conditionally recertified, after a &quot;top-to-bottom review&quot; of the voting machines certified for use in California in March 2007.

===VVSG 2.0 (2021)===
A new version of the VVSG was approved for adoption in February 2021. The VVSG 2.0 represents a significant advancement in defining standards that improves cybersecurity, accessibility, and usability requirements, while also introducing various audit methods supporting software independence to confirm the accuracy of the vote and increase voter confidence.

===2007 VVSG===
A draft version of the 2007 VVSG was developed by the TGDC and NIST. It was not approved by the TGDC nor the EAC.

===VVSG 1.0 (2005)===
The 2005 VVSG, which significantly increased security requirements for voting systems and expanded access, including opportunities to vote privately and independently, for individuals with disabilities, was unanimously adopted by the EAC in December 2005; It was version of the federal certification standards. During the 90-day public comment period, EAC received more than 6,000 comments on the proposed guidelines. These comments and the proposed guidelines are available via the Kennesaw State University. The 2005 VVSG will go into effect 24 months after their final
adoption (December 2007).

===Certification Origins and Roy Saltman===
In February 1975 an interagency agreement was formed with General Accounting Office’s Office of Federal Elections (predecessor to the Federal Election Commission) and the National Bureau of Standards (predecessor to the National Institute of Standards and Technology) resulting in a March 1975 report, &quot;Effective Use of Computing Technology in Vote-Tallying&quot;, authored by Roy Saltman. This report highlighted &quot;the lack of appropriate technical skills at the State and local level for developing or implementing written standards, against which voting system hardware and software could be evaluated.&quot;

The U.S. Congress then directed the Federal Election Commission (FEC), in conjunction with the National Bureau of Standards to create engineering and procedural performance standards for voting systems. Another report, &quot;Voting System Standards: A Report on the Feasibility of Developing Voluntary Standards for Voting Equipment&quot; was produced in early 1984. In July 1984 the FEC armed with congressionally appropriated funds began a six-year task of creating the first national performance and test standards for punchcard, marksense, and direct recording electronic voting systems.

The resulting body of work was the first set of voluntary Voting System Standards issued in 1990.

===FEC and NASED===
In addition to their involvement in the origins of national voting certification and testing, the FEC&#x27;s Office of Election Administration and the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) updated the initial Voting System Standards with the 2002 Voting System Standards/Guidelines.

The national testing effort was overseen by NASED’s Voting Systems Board, which is composed of election officials and independent technical advisors. NASED established a process for vendors to submit their equipment to an Independent Test Authority (ITA) for evaluation against the Standards. The NASED has compiled a list of Qualified Voting Systems 12-22-05

===EAC Interim Voting System Certification Program===
The Help America Vote Act mandated the federal certification process be assumed by the EAC. The EAC implemented an interim certification program in July 2006 which provided a means to obtain federal certification for modifications required by state and local election officials administering the 2006 General Election.

In summer 2006 the EAC barred the company Ciber Inc. from approving further voting machines. Federal officials found that it was not following its quality-control procedures and could not document that it was conducting all the required tests. According to the EAC &quot;Ciber, Inc. has applied for interim accreditation, but EAC has not completed its review, so the Ciber application is pending.&quot; They have released relevant documentation regarding the Ciber, Inc. application from accreditation.

<doc id="623714" wikidata="Q3092348" url="?curid=623714" title="The Atlanta Journal-Constitution">
<text>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) is an American daily newspaper based in metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia. It is the flagship publication of Cox Enterprises. The &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; is the result of the merger between The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. The two staffs were combined in 1982. Separate publication of the morning &quot;Constitution&quot; and the afternoon &quot;Journal&quot; ended in 2001 in favor of a single morning paper under the &quot;Journal-Constitution&quot; name.

The &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; has its headquarters in the Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody, Georgia. It was formerly co-owned with television flagship WSB-TV and six radio stations, which are located separately in midtown Atlanta; the newspaper remained part of Cox Enterprises, while WSB became part of an independent Cox Media Group.

==&quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;==

In 1868, Carey Wentworth Styles, along with his joint venture partners James Anderson and (future Atlanta mayor) William Hemphill purchased a small newspaper, the &quot;Atlanta Daily Opinion&quot; which they renamed &quot;The Constitution&quot;, as it was originally known, was first published on June 16, 1868. Its name changed to &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; in October 1869. Hemphill became the business manager, a position he retained until 1901. When Styles was unable to liquidate his holdings in an Albany newspaper, he could not pay for his purchase of the &quot;Constitution&quot;. He was forced to surrender his interest in the paper to Anderson and Hemphill, who each owned one half. In 1870, Anderson sold his one-half interest in the paper to Col. E. Y. Clarke. In active competition with other Atlanta newspapers, Hemphill hired special trains (one engine and car) to deliver newspapers to the Macon marketplace. The newspaper became such a force that by 1871 it had overwhelmed the &quot;Daily Intelligencer&quot;, the only Atlanta paper to survive the American Civil War. In August 1875, its name was changed to &quot;The Atlanta Daily Constitution&quot; for two weeks, then to &quot;The Constitution&quot; again for about a year. In 1876, Captain Evan Howell (a former &quot;Intelligencer&quot; city editor) purchased the 50 percent interest in the paper from E. Y. Clarke and became its editor-in-chief. That same year, Joel Chandler Harris began writing for the paper. He soon created the character of Uncle Remus, a black storyteller, to recount stories from African-American culture. The Howell family eventually owned full interest in the paper from 1902 until 1950.
In October 1876, the newspaper was renamed &quot;The Daily Constitution&quot; before settling on the name &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; in September 1881. During the 1880s, editor Henry W. Grady was a spokesman for the &quot;New South&quot;, encouraging industrial development as well as the founding of Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Evan Howell&#x27;s family would come to own &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; from 1902 to 1950.

The &quot;Constitution&quot; established one of the first radio broadcasting stations, WGM, which began operating on March 17, 1922, two days after the debut of the &quot;Journal&#x27;s&quot; WSB. However, WGM ceased operations after just over a year. Its equipment was donated to what was then known as Georgia School of Technology, which used it to help launch WBBF (later WGST, now WGKA AM 920) in January 1924.
In late 1947, the &quot;Constitution&quot; established radio station WCON (AM 550). Subsequently, it received approval to operate an FM station, WCON-FM 98.5 mHz, and a TV station, WCON-TV, on channel 2.

But the 1950 merger with the &quot;Journal&quot; required major adjustments. Contemporary Federal Communications Commission &quot;duopoly&quot; regulations disallowed owning more than one AM, FM, or TV station in a given market, and the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; already owned WSB AM 750 and WSB-FM 104.5, as well as WSB-TV on channel 8. WCON and the original WSB-FM were shut down to comply with the duopoly restrictions. The WCON-TV construction permit was canceled, and WSB-TV was allowed to move from channel 8 to channel 2. To standardize with its sister stations, WCON-FM&#x27;s call letters were changed to WSB-FM.

Ralph McGill, editor for the &quot;Constitution&quot; in the 1940s, was one of the few southern newspaper editors to support the American Civil Rights Movement. Other noteworthy editors of &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; include J. Reginald Murphy. &quot;Reg&quot; Murphy gained notoriety after being kidnapped in 1974. Murphy later moved to the West Coast and served as editor of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;.

Celestine Sibley was an award-winning reporter, editor, and beloved columnist for the &quot;Constitution&quot; from 1941 to 1999 and wrote 25 fiction and nonfiction books about Southern life. After her death, the Georgia House of Representatives named its press gallery in her honor as a mark of affection and respect.

From the 1970s until he died in 1994, Lewis Grizzard was a popular humor columnist for the &quot;Constitution&quot;. He portrayed Southern &quot;redneck&quot; culture with a mixture of ridicule and respect.

&quot;The Constitution&quot; won numerous Pulitzer Prizes. In 1931, it won a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for exposing corruption at the local level. In 1959, &quot;The Constitution&quot; won a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for Ralph McGill&#x27;s editorial &quot;&quot; In 1967, it was awarded another Pulitzer Prize for Eugene Patterson&#x27;s editorials. (Patterson later left his post as editor over a dispute over an op-ed piece.) In 1960, Jack Nelson won the Pulitzer Prize for local reporting by exposing abuses at Milledgeville State Hospital for the mentally ill.

The papers were published in independent editions even after newsrooms were combined in 1982. In 1988 the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning went to the &quot; Constitution&quot;″s Doug Marlette. Editorial cartoonist Mike Luckovich received Pulitzer Prizes in 1995 and 2006. Cynthia Tucker received a 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary.

==&quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;==
&quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; was established in 1883. Founder E. F. Hoge sold the paper to Atlanta lawyer Hoke Smith in 1887. After the &quot;Journal&quot; supported presidential candidate Grover Cleveland in the 1892 election, Smith was named as Secretary of the Interior by the victorious Cleveland. Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Margaret Mitchell worked for the &quot;Journal&quot; from 1922 to 1926. Essential for the development of her 1936 &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was the series of profiles of prominent Georgia Civil War generals she wrote for &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;″s Sunday magazine, the research for which, scholars believe, led her to her work on the novel. In 1922, the &quot;Journal&quot; founded one of the first radio broadcasting stations in the South, WSB. The radio station and the newspaper were sold in 1939 to James Middleton Cox, founder of Cox Enterprises. The &quot;Journal&quot; carried the motto &quot;Covers Dixie like the Dew&quot;.

==Merger==
Cox Enterprises bought the &quot;Constitution&quot; in June 1950, bringing both newspapers under one ownership and combining sales and administrative offices. Separate newsrooms were kept until 1982. Both newspapers continued to be published for another two decades, with much of the same content except for timely editing. The &quot;Journal&quot;, an afternoon paper, led the morning &quot;Constitution&quot; until the 1970s when afternoon papers began to fall out of favor with subscribers. In November 2001, the two papers, once fierce competitors, merged to produce one daily morning paper, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;. The two papers had published a combined edition on weekends and holidays for years previously.

Before the merger, both papers planned to start TV stations: WSB-TV on channel 8 for the &quot;Journal&quot;, and WCON-TV on channel 2 for the &quot;Constitution&quot;. Only WSB got on the air, beginning in 1948 as the first TV station in the Deep South. It moved from channel 8 to WCON&#x27;s allotment on channel 2 in 1951 to avoid TV interference from the nearby channel 9. (WROM-TV since moved, leaving WGTV on 8, after it was also used by WLWA-TV, now WXIA-TV 11.) This was also necessary to satisfy Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules preventing the excessive concentration of media ownership, preventing the combined paper from running two stations.

In 1989, Bill Dedman received the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, his exposé on racial discrimination in mortgage lending, or redlining, by Atlanta banks. The newspapers&#x27; editor, Bill Kovach, had resigned in November 1988 after the stories on banks and others had ruffled feathers in Atlanta and among corporate leadership, some of whom complained of a &quot;take-no-prisoners&quot; editorial approach.

In 1993, Mike Toner received the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for &quot;When Bugs Fight Back&quot;, his series about organisms and their resistance to antibiotics and pesticides.

Julia Wallace was named the first female editor of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; in 2002. She was named Editor of the Year 2004 by &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; magazine.

Mike Luckovich won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning a second time in 2006. He had first received it in 1995 under &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; banner.

==Circulation==
The paper used to cover all 159 counties in Georgia and the bordering counties of western North Carolina, where many Atlantans vacation or have second homes. In addition, it had some circulation in other bordering communities, such as Tallahassee, Florida, where the &quot;Sunday Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; was available. Due to the downturn in the newspaper industry and competing media sources, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; contracted distribution dramatically in the late 2000s to serve only the metro area. From Q1 of 2007 to Q1 of 2010, daily circulation plunged over 44%.

==Headquarters==
&quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; has its headquarters in Perimeter Center, an office district of Dunwoody, Georgia. Previously the &quot;AJC&quot; headquarters were in Downtown Atlanta near the Five Points district. In August 2009, the &quot;AJC&quot; occupied less than 30 percent of its downtown building, becoming outdated and costly. Later that year, the &quot;AJC&quot; consolidated its printing operations by transferring the downtown production center to the Gwinnett County facility. In 2010, the newspaper relocated its headquarters to leased offices in Dunwoody, a northern suburb of Atlanta. In November 2010, the company donated its former downtown headquarters to the city of Atlanta, which plans to convert the building into a fire and police training academy. In February 2024, the newspaper announced it would return its headquarters to midtown Atlanta after nearly 14 years, citing a desire &quot;to be at the beating heart of the city&quot; it is named for. The company signed a lease on 21,000 square feet of newsroom and studio space in the Promenade Central building on Peachtree Street, planning to complete its relocation by the end of the year.

== Controversy ==
In 1996, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; was the first newspaper to report on Centennial Olympic Park bombing hero Richard Jewell being accused of actually being the bomber, citing leaked information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Even after Jewell was cleared of any accusations by the FBI, the &quot;AJC&quot; refused to issue an apology and remains the only paper to have not retracted their story by Kathy Scruggs and Ron Martz falsely accusing him of terrorism. The court case regarding this has been dropped after the death of both Richard Jewell and the initial reporter. Jewell died not long after from diabetes due to poor eating habits that escalated after he was accused.

== Organization of the newspaper==
&quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; has four major sections daily. On Sundays, it has additional sections. The main section usually consists of Georgia, national, international, and business news. The Metro section includes major headlines from the Metro Atlanta area. The Metro section usually reports the weather forecast. The Sports section reports sports-related news. Before social media became popular, the Metro and Sports sections contained &quot;The Vent&quot; features, where readers expressed opinions about current events. The Living section contains articles, recipes, reviews, movie times, and puzzles, including Sudoku, crossword puzzle, and word scramble, plus a full page of color comics daily. Comics are printed in a separate section in Sunday editions.

<text>A database right is a &quot;sui generis&quot; property right, comparable to but distinct from copyright, that exists to recognise the investment that is made in compiling a database, even when this does not involve the &quot;creative&quot; aspect that is reflected by copyright. Such rights are often referred to in the plural: database rights.

The TRIPS Agreement requires that copyright protection extends to databases and other compilations if they constitute intellectual creation by virtue of the selection or arrangement of their contents, even if some or all of the contents do not themselves constitute materials protected by copyright. Many countries act in accordance with this requirement, as databases are protected by copyright if this condition is met, and there is no separate intellectual property right protecting databases (or any aspects of them) that do not meet the conditions for copyright protection. The database right extends protection over databases which does not depend on the condition required for copyright protection, and is recognised only in a small number of jurisdictions, most notably the European Union.

==Countries that recognise database rights==
===European Union===

In European Union law, database rights are specifically coded (i.e. &quot;sui generis&quot;) laws on the copying and dissemination of information in computer databases. These rights were first introduced in 1996. On 11 March 1996 the Council of the European Union passed Directive 96/9/EC of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, giving specific and separate legal rights (and limitations) to certain computer records. The law calls these database rights. Rights afforded to manual records under EU database rights laws are similar in format, but not identical, to those afforded artistic works.

Database rights last for 15 years. Each time a database is substantially modified, however, a new set of rights are created for that database. An owner has the right to object to the copying of substantial parts of their database, even if data is extracted and reconstructed piecemeal. Database rights under the EU are created automatically, vested in the employers of creators (when the action of creation was part of employment), and do not have to be registered to have effect.

Database rights are independent of copyright: The arrangement, selection, and presentation of the data may be protected by copyright, while the database as a whole can be protected by database right.

===United Kingdom===
On 1 January 1998, The Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 came into force, which implemented the EU Database Directive. These regulations made a number of amendments to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 with respect to databases, a database being defined as 
:&quot;a collection of independent works, data or other materials which --- 
::(a) are arranged in a systematic or methodical way, and
::(b) are individually accessible by electronic or other means&quot;

The regulations extend existing copyright law to databases, to the extent that they constitute &quot;the author&#x27;s own intellectual creation&quot;.

In addition, regulations 13 and 14 create a database right. Database rights automatically subsist if there has been a &quot;substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents&quot; of the database.

Such rights remain in force under regulation 17(2) until the end of the 15th calendar year from the date on which the database was first made available to the public. During that period, database right will be infringed by any person who, without consent, &quot;extracts or re-uses all or a substantial part of the contents of the database&quot;, whether all at once or by repeated extractions of &quot;insubstantial&quot; parts.

On the other hand, any lawful user of the database has a right under regulation 19(1) &quot;to extract or re-use insubstantial parts of the data for any purpose&quot;, and that right cannot be restricted by the database owner (regulation 19(2)). The term &quot;substantial&quot; is defined to mean &quot;substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both&quot;.

Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, database rights that existed before 1 January 2021 retain reciprocal recognition between the UK and EEA for their original duration, while those created on or after that date are only protected within the creator&#x27;s jurisdiction - either the EEA &quot;or&quot; the UK.

===Russia===
In article 1260 of the Civil Code of Russia, a database is a collection of independent materials presented in an objective form (articles, accounts, legal texts, judicial decisions, and other similar materials), which are systematically arranged in a way that these materials can be found and processed by a computer. A database need not be registered to enjoy legal protection, but the Civil Code of Russia provides for the registration of rights, which is useful if the claims are disputed in court.

Russia generally follows the EU model, there are some differences.

==Countries that do not recognise database rights==

===United States===
Uncreative collections of facts are outside of Congressional authority under the Copyright Clause (Article I, § 8, cl. 8) of the United States Constitution, therefore no database right exists in the United States. Originality is the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of copyright in the United States (&quot;see Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service&quot;). This has not stopped database owners lobbying for the introduction of such a right, but so far bills to introduce it in the US have been prevented by the successful lobbying of research libraries, consumer groups and firms who benefit from the free use of factual information.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, Federal Law No. 9610 of 1998 (the Law of the authorial rights) confers database owners exclusive rights specifically for copying, distribution and translation of databases.
The same law also states that this right is contingent upon the database being the result of an intellectual creation, which may be deemed so based on &quot;the selection, organization, or disposition of its content&quot;.
Therefore, consistent with international law and the position in many jurisdictions, legislation in Brazil may or may not offer copyright protection to databases, depending on how the database was developed.

<text>A daysailer, day sailer, or dayboat is a small sailboat with or without sleeping accommodations but which is larger than a dinghy. Dayboats can be monohull or multihull, and are typically trailer-able. Many dayboats have a small cabin or &quot;cuddy&quot; for storage and to provide shelter, or for sleeping in, but which is not always large enough to stand erect in. Dayboats&#x27; greater stability also distinguishes them from dinghies and are generally sailed more like a small yacht than a dinghy. For example, although crew weight may well be shifted to increase performance, this is not crucial to stability, as it is in a dinghy. The distinction between keelboats and day sailers is not always clear. Generally a keelboat is a large boat (over 27 feet (8.2m) and usually not trailer-able) used for longer trips, whereas daysailers, as the name implies, are used for trips less than 48 hours, often only a single day.

<doc id="623720" wikidata="Q1050339" url="?curid=623720" title="De Havilland Flamingo">
<text>The de Havilland DH.95 Flamingo was a British twin-engined high-wing monoplane airliner first flown on 22 December 1938. During the Second World War some were used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a transport and general communications duties.

==Design and development==
The Flamingo was a twin-engined civil airliner developed by de Havilland, led by their newly appointed chief designer R. E. Bishop, and was the first all-metal stressed-skin aircraft built by the company; only the control surfaces were fabric covered. It was powered by two 890 hp Bristol Perseus air-cooled sleeve-valve radial engines driving three-bladed de Havilland Propellers &#x27;Hydromatic&#x27; variable-pitch propellers. Two pilots were seated side by side with a radio operator behind them in the cockpit, with the cabin accommodating 12–17 passengers depending on the flight distance. It had a retractable undercarriage, slotted flaps, and was considered a highly promising sales prospect for the company, capable of competing with the American Douglas DC-3 and Lockheed Model 10 Electra. The first prototype flew on 22 December 1938. It had a third central fin fitted as a temporary measure; this was removed when larger fins with larger rudder area were fitted to the twin tail

Powered by 890 hp (660 kW) Bristol Perseus XIIIC engines, it had a maximum weight takeoff in 750 ft (230 m) and the ability to maintain height or climb at 120 mph (190 km/h) on a single engine.

Testing was successful, with the Flamingo being granted a certificate of airworthiness on 30 June 1939, with an initial production run of twenty aircraft being laid down. The Air Ministry were interested in the Flamingo as a military transport and issued a serial T5357 for official evaluation.

A single military transport variant was built to Specification 19/39 as the DH.95 Hertfordshire. It had small circular cabin windows instead of the rectangular ones, and seating for 22 soldiers. A proposed order for 30 was cancelled to leave de Havilland free to produce Tiger Moth trainers. The sole Hertfordshire (R2510) crashed on 23 October 1940 at Mill Hill killing five crew and six passengers, including Air Vice-marshal Charles Blount, the Air Officer Commanding No. 22 Group RAF travelling from Hendon to Northern Ireland, apparently due to jamming of the elevator.

==Operational service==
Following the success of the first test flights Jersey Airways ordered three 17-seat aircraft, and this was followed by orders from the Egyptian government and the Air Ministry. The Air Ministry aircraft were to be used by the Air Council and the King&#x27;s Flight.

The prototype, fitted with 12 passenger seats, was delivered to Jersey Airways in May 1939 for two months evaluation and became the first revenue-earning Flamingo. The first services carried mail only but in July a regular weekend passenger service was operated.

In October 1939 the prototype was bought by the Air Council, being delivered to No. 24 Squadron RAF where it operated until it was lost in an accident in October 1940. The second aircraft was to be the first for Guernsey and Jersey Airlines but it was impressed into military service and delivered to 24 Squadron, the other two on order were never built due to the outbreak of the Second World War.

Two Flamingos &quot;R2764&quot; and &quot;R2565&quot; built to Specification 21/39 for the RAF were sent to the Kings Flight at RAF Benson. Flamingo &quot;R2766&quot; (built to Specification 20/39) with 24 Squadron joined them in The King&#x27;s Flight (with civilian serial G-AGCC) during the invasion scare period in June to be used in the event of the royal family having to leave the country but passed back to 24 Squadron for communications and liaison duties in early 1941 becoming &quot;R2766&quot; again and given the additional name &#x27;Lady of Glamis&#x27; in 1942. G-AGAZ, a test bed for Perseus Mk XVI engines became &quot;AE444&quot; with 24 Squadron and named &#x27;Lady of Ayr&#x27;.

Early in 1940 BOAC ordered eight aircraft to be powered by the Perseus XVI and originally intended as ten-seaters. The first BOAC aircraft was delivered to Whitchurch on 5 September 1940. The second BOAC aircraft was impressed by the Air Ministry and allocated for Admiralty use at RNAS Donibristle. To replace the impressed aircraft BOAC were later allotted the aircraft ordered by the Egyptian Government. After a period of training all the BOAC Flamingos were moved to Cairo to operate in the Middle East. The BOAC aircraft were named after English kings (Arthur, Alfred, Harold, Henry, Richard, James, Charles, William) and were named &quot;K-class&quot; by the airline.

The Flamingo was Winston Churchill&#x27;s favourite short/medium range transport and he flew it to visit Reynaud and the French leadership as the Western front collapsed on May 16, 1940.

The BOAC Flamingoes were not popular, and following three accidents – one of which was fatal – and with a lack of spares, the airline decided to withdraw the type. In 1943 the four airworthy aircraft were shipped back to the United Kingdom and stored at Croydon. They did not return to service and were scrapped at Redhill in the early 1950s.

Most of the RAF aircraft were withdrawn from use during the war and were slowly scrapped to provide spares for the remaining aircraft. The Admiralty aircraft (&quot;BT312&quot; ‘Merlin VI&#x27;) was due to be withdrawn and scrapped but in August 1944 it ground looped at Gatwick and was abandoned. In 1946 the former Admiralty aircraft was bought by Southern Aircraft (Gatwick) and rebuilt using former BOAC spare parts. It flew again in 1947 and was delivered to British Air Transport at Redhill, gaining a Certificate of Airworthiness. It operated a number of charter flight until it was temporarily withdrawn from use in 1949 before scrapped in 1954.

British Air Transport also arranged to restore three former BOAC aircraft, the scheme was abandoned although the aircraft were in an advanced stage of reconstruction. In 1952, British Air Transport restored the original former Admiralty aircraft which flew again on 27 May 1952. Redhill Aerodrome was closed in 1954 and the last flying Flamingo was dismantled and scrapped.
A short clip of a Flamingo appears in the film &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;

<text>Diomede (; Ancient Greek: Διομήδη &quot;Diomēdē&quot;) is the name of four women in Greek mythology:

* Diomede, daughter of Xuthus. She married Deioneus, king of Phocis, and was the mother of Cephalus, Actor, Aenetus, Phylacus and Asterodia.(Interwiki: bn, ja)
* Diomede or Diomedes, a Lapith and daughter of Lapithes and possibly of Orsinome. She married King Amyclas of Sparta and became the mother of King Argalus, King Cynortes, Hyacinthus, Polyboea, Laodamia (or Leanira), Harpalus, Hegesandre and, in other versions, of Daphne.
* Diomede, according to Homer, the daughter of one Phorbas, taken by Achilles as captive from Lesbos. She is named in the Iliad as the captive that Achilles lays with after he turns away the embassy of Ajax and Odysseus.
* Diomede, wife of Pallas and mother of Euryalus, who fought at Troy. Nothing else is known about her.

<text>The minister of northern affairs () is a minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet. The position has been held by Gary Anandasangaree since 20 December 2024.

In 1953, the role of Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources was created as a formal successor to the Minister of Resources and Development, receiving the previous position&#x27;s roles with an additional focus on territorial and Inuit relations. Similarly, the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources was created in the same legislation to replace the previous Department of Resources and Development.

In 1966, the portfolio&#x27;s responsibilities were divided between the new posts of Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, which were given the majority of the northern affairs and national resources portfolios, respectively.

In 2019, the northern affairs portfolio of Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) was assigned back to a separate Minister of Northern Affairs, who works within CIRNAC with the Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations.

<text>Guo Moruo (November 16, 1892 – June 12, 1978), courtesy name Dingtang, was a Chinese author, poet, historian, archaeologist, and government official.

==Biography==

===Family history===
Guo Moruo, originally named Guo Kaizhen, was born on November 10 or 16, in the small town of Shawan, located on the Dadu River some southwest from what was then called the city of Jiading (Lu) (Chia-ting (Lu), ), and now is the central urban area of the prefecture level city of Leshan in Sichuan Province.

At the time of Guo&#x27;s birth, Shawan was a town of some 180 families.

Guo&#x27;s father&#x27;s ancestors were Hakkas from Ninghua County in Tingzhou Prefecture, near the western border of Fujian. They moved to Sichuan in the second half of the 17th century, after Sichuan had lost much of its population to the rebels/bandits of Zhang Xianzhong ( 1605–1647). According to family legend, the only possessions that Guo&#x27;s ancestors brought to Sichuan were things they could carry on their backs. Guo&#x27;s great-grandfather, Guo Xianlin, was the first in the family to achieve a degree of prosperity. Guo Xianlin&#x27;s sons established the Guo clan as the leaders of the local river shipping business, and thus important people in that entire region of Sichuan. It was only then that the Guo clan members became able to send their children to school.

Guo&#x27;s father, one of whose names may possibly have been Guo Mingxing (1854–1939), had to drop out of school at the age of 13 and then spent six months as an apprentice at a salt well. Thereafter he entered his father&#x27;s business, a shrewd and smart man who achieved some local renown as a Chinese medical doctor, traded successfully in oils, opium, liquor, and grain and operated a money changing business. His business success allowed him to increase the family&#x27;s real estate and salt well holdings.

Guo&#x27;s mother, in contrast, came from a scholar-official background. She was a daughter of Du Zhouzhang, a holder of the coveted &quot;jinshi&quot; degree. Whilst serving as an acting magistrate in Huangping prefecture (), now part of Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, in eastern Guizhou, Du died in 1858 while fighting Miao rebels, when his daughter (the future mother of Guo Moruo) was less than a year old. She married into the Guo family in 1872, when she was fourteen.

===Childhood===
Guo was the eighth child of his mother. Three of his siblings had died before he was born, but more children were born later, so by the time he went to school, he had seven siblings.

Guo also had the childhood name Guo Wenbao (&quot;Cultivated Leopard&quot;), given due to a dream his mother had on the night he was conceived.

A few years before Guo was born, his parents retained a private tutor, Shen Huanzhang, to provide education for their children, in the hope of them later passing civil service examinations. A precocious child, Guo started studying at this &quot;family school&quot; in the spring of 1897, at the early age of four and a half. Initially, his studies were based on Chinese classics, but with the government education reforms of 1901, mathematics and other modern subjects started to be introduced.

When in the fall of 1903 a number of public schools were established in Sichuan&#x27;s capital, Chengdu, the Guo children started going there to study. Guo&#x27;s oldest brother, Guo Kaiwen (1877–1936), entered one of them, Dongwen Xuetang, a secondary school preparing students for study in Japan; the next oldest brother, Guo Kaizou, joined Wubei Xuetang, a military school. Guo Kaiwen soon became instrumental in exposing his brother and sisters still in Shawan to modern books and magazines that allowed them to learn about the wide world outside.

Guo Kaiwen continued to be a role model for his younger brothers when in February 1905 he left for Japan, to study law and administration at Tokyo Imperial University on a provincial government scholarship.

After passing competitive examinations, in early 1906 Guo Moruo started attending the new upper-level primary school () in Jiading. It was a boarding school located in a former Buddhist temple and the boy lived on premises. He went on to a middle school in 1907, acquiring by this time the reputation of an academically gifted student but a troublemaker. His peers respected him and often elected him a delegate to represent their interests in front of the school administration. Often spearheading student-faculty conflicts, he was expelled and reinstated a few times, and finally expelled permanently in October 1909.

Guo was glad to be expelled, as he now had a reason to go to the provincial capital Chengdu to continue his education there.

In October 1911, Guo was surprised by his mother announcing that a marriage was arranged for him. He went along with his family&#x27;s wishes, marrying his appointed bride, Zhang Jinghua, sight-unseen in Shawan in March 1912. Immediately, he regretted this marriage, and five days after the marriage, he left his ancestral home and returned to Chengdu, leaving his wife behind. He never formally divorced her, but apparently never lived with her either.

===Study abroad===

Following his elder brothers, Guo left China in December 1913, reaching Japan in early January 1914. After a year of preparatory study in Tokyo, he entered Sixth Higher School in Okayama. When visiting a friend of his hospitalized in Saint Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Tokyo, in the summer of 1916, Guo fell in love with Sato Tomiko, a Japanese woman from a Christian family, who worked at the hospital as a student nurse. Sato would become his common-law wife. They were to stay together for 20 years, until the outbreak of the war, and to have five children together.

After graduation from the Okayama school, Guo entered in 1918 the Medical School of Kyushu Imperial University in Fukuoka. He was more interested in literature than medicine, however. His studies at this time focused on foreign language and literature, namely the works of: Spinoza, Goethe, Walt Whitman, and the Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Along with numerous translations, he published his first anthology of poems, entitled &quot;The Goddesses&quot; () (1921). He co-founded the Creation Society () in Shanghai, which promoted modern and vernacular literature.

===The war years===

Guo joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1927. He was involved in the Communist Nanchang Uprising and fled to Japan after its failure. He stayed there for 10 years studying Chinese ancient history. During that time he published his work on inscriptions on oracle bones and bronze vessels, &quot;Corpus of Inscriptions on Bronzes from the Two Zhou Dynasties&quot; (). During this period he published ten monographs on archeology of the Shang and Zhou periods and ancient Chinese script, thus establishing himself as a preeminent scholar in the field.

In the summer of 1937, shortly after the Marco Polo Bridge incident, Guo returned to China to join the anti-Japanese resistance. His attempt to arrange for Sato Tomiko and their children to join him in China were frustrated by the Japanese authorities, and in 1939 he remarried to , a Shanghai actress. After the war, Sato went to reunite with him but was disappointed to know that he had already formed a new family.

In early February 1942, Guō Mòruò created a five-act historical drama 虎符, &quot;Hǔfú&quot; (&quot;Tiger Talisman&quot;) in a single nine-day period.

===As a communist leader===

Along with holding important government offices in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Guo was a prolific writer, not just of poetry but also fiction, plays, autobiographies, translations, and historical and philosophical treatises. He was the first President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and remained so from its founding in 1949 until his death in 1978. He was also the first president of University of Science &amp; Technology of China (USTC), a new type of university established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and aimed at fostering high-level personnel in the fields of science and technology.

For the first 15 years of the PRC, Guo, with his extensive knowledge of Chinese history and culture, was the ultimate arbiter of philosophical matters relating to art, education, and literature, although all of his most vital and important work had been written before 1949.

Guo was one of the leaders of China&#x27;s delegation to the December 1957 Afro-Asian Peoples&#x27; Solidarity Conference, along with Liu Liangmo, Liu Ningyi, and Ji Chaoding.

With the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Guo became an early target of persecution. To save face, he wrote a public self-criticism and declared that all his previous works were in error and should be burned. He then turned to writing poetry praising Mao&#x27;s wife Jiang Qing and the Cultural Revolution and also denounced former friends and colleagues as counterrevolutionaries. However, this was not enough to protect his family. Two of his sons, Guo Minying and Guo Shiying, &quot;committed suicide&quot; in 1967 and 1968 following &quot;criticism&quot; or persecution by Red Guards.
Because of his sycophantic loyalty to Mao, he survived the Cultural Revolution and received commendation by the chairman at the 9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in April 1969. By the early 1970s, he had regained most of his influence. He enjoyed all the privileges of the highest-ranking party elites, including residence in a luxurious manor house once owned by a Qing official, a staff of assigned servants, a state limousine, and other perks. Guo also maintained a large collection of antique furniture and curios in his home.

In 1978, following Mao&#x27;s death and the fall of the Gang of Four, the 85 year old Guo, as he lay dying in a Beijing hospital, penned a poem denouncing the Gang.

:: (What wonderful news!)
:: (Rooting out the Gang of Four.)
:: (The literary rogue.)
:: (The political rogue.)
:: (The sinister adviser.)
:: (The White-Boned Demon.)
:: (All swept away by the iron broom.)

The White-Boned Demon was a character in the Ming-era novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, an evil shapeshifting being, and was a popular derogatory nickname for Jiang Qing.

In March of the same year, (1978), Guo defied illness to attend the First National Science Conference, the first of its kind to be held since the end of the Cultural Revolution. He was visibly frail and it would be the last time he was seen in public before his death three months later.

Guo was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize in 1951.

==Legacy==
Guo was held in high regard in Chinese contemporary literature, history and archaeology. He once called himself the Chinese answer to Goethe and this appraisal was widely accepted. Zhou Yang said: &quot;You are Goethe, but you are the Goethe of the New Socialist Era of China.&quot;(&quot;&quot;)

He was criticised as the first of &quot;Four Contemporary Shameless Writers&quot;. For example, he spoke highly of Mao Zedong&#x27;s calligraphy, to the extent that he justified what the CCP leader had written mistakenly. His historical works have been described by historians as &quot;near-pseudohistorical&quot; due to his political manipulation of ancient Chinese classics. And during the Cultural Revolution, he published a book called &quot;Li Bai and Du Fu&quot; in which he praised Li Bai while belittling Du Fu, which was thought to flatter Mao Zedong. His attitude to the Gang of Four changed sharply before and after its downfall.

In his private life, he was also known to have affairs with many women, whom he abandoned shortly afterwards. One of them, Li Chen (), allegedly committed suicide after his betrayal, although this is disputed.

==Family==

Guo had five children (four sons and a daughter) with Sato Tomiko and six with Yu Liqun (four sons and two daughters). An article published in the 2000s said that eight out of the eleven were alive, and that three have died.

With Sato Tomiko (listed chronologically in the order of birth):
*son Guo Hefu () (December 12 (or 31, according to other sources) 1917, Okayama - September 13, 1994). A chemist, he moved from Japan to Taiwan in 1946 and to mainland China in 1949. He was the founder of the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
*son Guo Bo () (born 1920), a renowned architect and photographer. He came to China in 1955, invited by his father, and worked in Shanghai, where he participated in the design of many of its famous modern buildings. Guo Bu is also known as a photographer of Shanghai&#x27;s heritage architecture; an album of his photographic work has been published as a book.
*son Guo Fusheng ().
*daughter Guo Shuyu (), a Japanese-language teacher, now deceased.
*son Guo Zhihong ().

With Yu Liqun (listed chronologically in the order of birth):
*son Guo Hanying () (born 1941, Chongqing). An internationally published theoretical physicist.
*daughter Guo Shuying (). She published a book about her father.
*son Guo Shiying () (1942 - April 22, 1968). In 1962, while a philosophy student at Beijing University, he created an &quot;underground&quot; &quot;X Poetry Society&quot;. In the summer of 1963 the society was exposed and deemed subversive. Guo Shiying was sentenced to re-education through labor. While working at a farm in Henan province, he developed interest in agriculture. Returning to Beijing in 1965, he enrolled at Beijing Agricultural University. In 1968, kidnapped by Red Guards and &quot;tried&quot; by their &quot;court&quot; for his poetry-society activity years before he jumped out of the window of the third-floor room where he was held and died at the age of 26. His father in his later writing expressed regret for encouraging his son to return to Beijing from the farm, thinking that it indirectly led to his death.
*son Guo Minying (), (November 1943, Chongqing - April 12, 1967). His death is described as an unexpected suicide.
*daughter Guo Pingying ()
*son Guo Jianying () (born 1953).

==Commemoration==
*Guo&#x27;s residence in Beijing, near Shicha Lake (Shichahai), where he lived after the war with his second (or third, if the arranged marriage is to be counted) wife, Yu Liqun, is preserved as a museum.
*Guo and Sato Tomiko&#x27;s house in Ichikawa, Chiba, Japan, where they lived from 1927 to 1937, is a museum as well. Due to the Guo Moruo connection, Ichikawa chose to establish sister city relations with Leshan in 1981.
*W.E.B. Du Bois dedicated his poem &quot;I Sing to China&quot; to Guo.

<text>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Nicknamed CR7, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, and has won numerous individual accolades throughout his professional footballing career, including five Ballon d&#x27;Or awards, a record three UEFA Men&#x27;s Player of the Year Awards, four European Golden Shoes, and was named five times the world&#x27;s best player by FIFA. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues and the UEFA European Championship. Ronaldo holds the records for most goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals (14) and assists (8) in the European Championship, and most international appearances (217) and international goals (135). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 900 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time. 

Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He went on to become a star player at United, as they won three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d&#x27;Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). Ronaldo was integral to Madrid becoming a dominant force again, as they won four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including &quot;La Décima&quot;. He won back-to-back Ballon d&#x27;Or awards in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer and finished as the Champions League&#x27;s top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Madrid, Ronaldo&#x27;s additional titles include two La Liga titles and two Copas del Rey. In 2018, following issues with the Madrid hierarchy, Ronaldo made a surprise transfer to Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million). He won several trophies in Italy, including two Serie A titles and a Coppa Italia, and broke several records for Juventus. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club&#x27;s top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr, a move that since been widely credited for revolutionising football in Saudi Arabia.

Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned more than 200 caps, making him history&#x27;s most-capped male player. With 135 international goals, he is also the all-time top male goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in eleven major tournaments and scored in ten; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement saw him receive his fourth Ballon d&#x27;Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. The same tournament, he broke the record of most international goals scored in men&#x27;s football and became the player with the most international caps in men&#x27;s football in 2023.

One of the world&#x27;s most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world&#x27;s highest-paid athlete by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2016, 2017, 2023, and 2024 and the world&#x27;s most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. &quot;Time&quot; included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. Ronaldo is the most popular sportsperson on social media: he counts over 1 billion total followers across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, making him the first person to achieve that feat. In 2020, Ronaldo was named to the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team and he is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career. In recognition of his record-breaking goalscoring success, Ronaldo received special awards for Outstanding Career Achievement by FIFA in 2021 and Champions League All-Time Top Scorer by UEFA in 2024.
== Early life ==
Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the &quot;Junta de Freguesia&quot; of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father&#x27;s side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia &quot;Kátia&quot;. He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father&#x27;s alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.

As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP&#x27;s youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student, and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had &quot;disrespected&quot; him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP&#x27;s official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he had not become a professional football player.

Growing up, Ronaldo idolised the Brazilian footballers Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Nazário, and has described them as leaving &quot;a beautiful history in football&quot;.

== Club career ==
=== Sporting CP ===
After impressing in Sporting&#x27;s youth teams, he was promoted to the main team by first-team manager László Bölöni. At age 17, on 14 August 2002, he played his first official match for the first team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan, and his Primeira Liga debut, took place a month later against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win. Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal&#x27;s stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson said Ronaldo was &quot;one of the most exciting young players&quot; he had ever seen.

=== Manchester United ===
==== 2003–2007: Development and breakthrough ====

On 12 August 2003, less than a week after the friendly that impressed Ferguson, Manchester United signed Ronaldo for £12 million, an England record for a teenager. This also made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.

Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: &quot;He&#x27;s been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.&quot;
Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as &quot;undoubtedly the most exciting debut&quot; he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. On 15 May 2004, in a victory against Aston Villa, Ronaldo scored the opening goal and later received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football with a trophy, scoring the opening goal in United&#x27;s 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his &quot;elaborate&quot; step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was &quot;not a show pony, but the real thing&quot;, and predicted he would become a world-class player.
At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United&#x27;s 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.

During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger&#x27;s showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club. Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title.

==== 2007–2009: Collective and individual success and Ballon d&#x27;Or ====

In the 2006–07 season, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season, winning the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Player&#x27;s Player, Fans&#x27; Player, Young Player of the Year awards, and the Football Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d&#x27;Or, and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.

Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. United reached the final against Chelsea
in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious, winning 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw at the end of 120 minutes. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year. With his 2008 Ballon d&#x27;Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United&#x27;s first Ballon d&#x27;Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.

Shortly after, Ronaldo was linked to a move to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid&#x27;s alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. and he remained at United for another year. 
His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United&#x27;s 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.

=== Real Madrid ===
==== 2009–2015: World record transfer and consecutive Ballon d&#x27;Or wins ====

In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then world record £80 million. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Ronaldo said, &quot;This is the completion of my boyhood dream, to be a Real Madrid player.&quot;

Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. Despite scoring 33 goals in all competitions and contributing to Real Madrid&#x27;s 96 points in La Liga, his first season with Madrid ended trophyless.
Following Raúl&#x27;s departure, Ronaldo was given No. 7 for the 2010–11 season and scored 53 goals, helping Madrid win the Copa del Rey, scoring the winning goal against rivals Barcelona in the &quot;El Clásico&quot;, his first trophy with Madrid. He also became the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.

The following season saw Ronaldo score 60 goals across all competitions, leading Madrid to their first league title in four years with a record 100 points and his runner-up finish to Lionel Messi in the 2011 FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or. He scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás. In the 2012–13 season, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive &quot;Clásicos&quot; when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or, behind four-time winner Messi.

Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in &quot;El Clasico&quot; on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.

In 2013–14 season, Ronaldo was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale and together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed &quot;BBC&quot;, an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). He continued prolific scoring, with 69 goals in 2013, winning the 2013 FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or, and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.
Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win &quot;La Décima&quot;, their tenth European Cup, scoring a penalty in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over city rivals Atlético Madrid, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. As the competition&#x27;s top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, along with Liverpool&#x27;s Luis Suárez On 4 May, Ronaldo scored a back-heeled volley in the closing moments of the match against Valencia, voted goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (LFP), giving him the Best Player in La Liga award.

During the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, and after winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d&#x27;Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.

==== 2015–2018: All-time Madrid top scorer and Fifth Ballon d&#x27;Or ====
Cristiano Ronaldo became Real Madrid&#x27;s all-time top scorer on 12 September 2015 against Espanyol, netting 230 goals in 203 matches, surpassing the previous record holder, Raúl. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. He won the 2016 Ballon d&#x27;Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.
In the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo. He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012. In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition&#x27;s top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career. Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.

On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Player award for the second consecutive year. A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d&#x27;Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On 3 April 2024, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3–0 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a &quot;PlayStation goal&quot; by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo&#x27;s foot approximately off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches. In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3–1, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so. He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals. After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.

=== Juventus ===
Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018 for €100 million, the transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.

==== 2018–2020: Consecutive Serie A titles ====

On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against Chievo Verona. On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juve, he was sent off against Valencia, his first red card in 154 Champions League appearances. In the reverse (home) leg against Valencia, Cristiano won 100 Champions League matches, becoming the first ever player to do so.

Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan. On 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3–0 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori&#x27;s single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal. On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win against Atlético in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals. On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the &quot;scudetto&quot; clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2–1 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy. With 21 goals and eight assists, Ronaldo won the league award for Most Valuable Player.

On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus&#x27;s 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen including breaking Iker Casillas&#x27; record for most Champions League wins of all time. On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of , higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2–1 away win against Sampdoria. He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4–0 home win against Cagliari and became only the second player to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2–1 away win against SPAL. On 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2–0 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history. On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2–1 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, and becoming the second player after Edin Džeko to score 50 goals in three of Europe&#x27;s top five major leagues. Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948. On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time. On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2–1 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel&#x27;s club record of 36 goals in a single season.

==== 2020–2021: 100 Juve goals, &quot;Capocannoniere&quot;, and departure ====
Ronaldo played his 100th match in all competitions for Juventus on 13 December, scoring two penalties in a 3–1 away win over Genoa in the league to bring his goal tally to 79. On 2 March 2021, he scored a goal in a 3–0 win over Spezia in his 600th league match, to become the first player to score at least 20 goals in 12 consecutive seasons in the top five leagues of Europe. On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3–1 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat. With Juventus&#x27;s victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy. Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the &quot;Capocannoniere&quot; award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.

The start of the following season came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window, despite Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reaching a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal, and later it was confirmed that City&#x27;s rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo&#x27;s former club, were in advanced talks to sign him, while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.

=== Return to Manchester United ===

On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical. Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21. The first 24 hours of Ronaldo&#x27;s shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.

On 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United. On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United&#x27;s 2–1 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition. Ronaldo proved to be crucial in the next Champions League fixtures, scoring various last minute goals to help United qualify for the round of 16 as group winners. On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals. Struggles ensued, with a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager, continuing for two months, until he scored in United&#x27;s 2–0 win at home versus Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 15 February 2022, his first in the new year. He finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United&#x27;s Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, but United finished in a disappointing sixth place and qualified for the UEFA Europa League; as a result, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.

After growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo desired to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, but a move failed to materialise, with various European clubs refusing a transfer, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands. Shortly after, he fell out with manager Erik ten Hag who used him as a substitute, leading United to terminate his contract on 22 November, following an interview with Piers Morgan, where Ronaldo said that he felt &quot;betrayed&quot; by Ten Hag and criticised the management of the club.

=== Al Nassr ===

On 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al-Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club, signing a contract until 2025. Ronaldo received the highest football salary ever, at €200 million per year, including a guaranteed football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals bringing his total annual salary to €200 million.

He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January 2023, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 win over Al-Ettifaq, and scored his first goal in a 2–2 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty. On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4–0 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal. According to the BBC, Ronaldo&#x27;s transfer to Al-Nassr led a &quot;revolution&quot; in Asian football, with many players from other leagues, particularly those in Europe, transferring to Saudi Pro League clubs for the 2023–24 season.

In the final of the Arab Club Champions Cup on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2–1 after extra time. Ronaldo scored six goals in the competition. At the close of the year, Ronaldo scored 54 goals in all competitions for Al-Nassr and Portugal, making him the outright top scorer in 2023, reaching the same goalscoring record as in 2016. On 27 May 2024, in Al Nassr&#x27;s home fixture against Al-Ittihad, Ronaldo scored his 34th and 35th league goals of the campaign, surpassing Abderrazak Hamdallah&#x27;s record for the most goals scored in a single Saudi Pro League season. He also became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in four different leagues, the English, Spanish, Italian and Saudi leagues. On 31 May, in a 5–4 penalty shoot-out defeat to Al-Hilal in the 2024 King Cup final following a 1–1 draw after extra-time (in which he scored his side&#x27;s second spot kick), he equalled Rogério Ceni&#x27;s record for most top-level matches by a male professional footballer (1,225).

== International career ==
At the age of 18, Ronaldo made his debut for Portugal as a substitute against Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003. At UEFA Euro 2004, he scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to Greece in his eighth international appearance. Despite Portugal losing to Greece again in the final, Ronaldo made the team of the tournament, with two assists and two goals. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, at the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. Portugal reached the semi-finals, where Portugal lost to France, with Ronaldo being booed during their defeat, due to an incident that occurred in the quarter-finals against England. FIFA&#x27;s Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament&#x27;s Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany&#x27;s Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.
On 6 February 2007, Cristiano captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly against Brazil. He wore the number 7 shirt ahead of UEFA Euro 2008. Despite scoring eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the finals, netting the second goal of Portugal&#x27;s 3–1 win in the group stage game against the Czech Republic. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a 3–2 loss to Germany.

Ronaldo failed to score in 2010 World Cup qualifying. He scored only one goal in the 2010 World Cup finals; despite this, he was named man of the match in all three group stage matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 demolishing of North Korea, which was his first international goal in 16 months. Two years later, in UEFA Euro 2012, Ronaldo was joint top scorer with three goals, enough for him to be included in the team of the tournament. During qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored eight goals. Despite this, Portugal did not qualify directly; Ronaldo scored all four goals against Sweden in the play-off to qualify. At the tournament in Brazil, Ronaldo assisted a last-minute 2–2 equaliser against the United States, and scored an 80th-minute winner in a 2–1 win over Ghana.
In 2016, Ronaldo led Portugal to their first-ever trophy at the UEFA Euro 2016, although he was subbed off in the 25th minute in the final against hosts France. He received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer, which gave him his fourth Ballon d&#x27;Or later that year. With the win, Portugal qualified and made its only appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia, where they finished in third place, with Ronaldo being named man of the match in all three of Portugal&#x27;s group stage matches.

In the 2018 World Cup, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, in a 3–3 draw against Spain. The following match, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Morocco, breaking Puskás&#x27; record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.

Ronaldo led Portugal to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. Ronaldo also became the first player to score at five European Championships. On 23 June 2021, Ronaldo scored two goals in the Euro 2020 match against France, breaking the men&#x27;s goalscoring record previously held by Ali Daei.
On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos&#x27;s record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, thus becoming the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men&#x27;s international football.

In the 2022 World Cup, on 24 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score at five World Cups, netting a penalty against Ghana. Following a dispute with manager Fernando Santos, after their last group game against South Korea, he was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal&#x27;s last 16 match, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000.

On 23 March 2023, Ronaldo scored a brace against Liechtenstein as he earned his 197th overall cap to become the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men&#x27;s international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their qualifying group, following a 5–0 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).

With his start in Portugal&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2024 opener against the Czech Republic, Ronaldo became the first player to feature in six European Championships, having previously been the first player to appear in five. Later that year, on 5 September, he scored his 900th career goal in a 2–1 victory over Croatia in the UEFA Nations League.

== Player profile ==
=== Style of play ===

A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called &#x27;chops&#x27; that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.

His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of , give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Ronaldo holds the record for the highest recorded jump in football history, measuring , which he achieved during a match against Manchester United while playing for Real Madrid in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2013. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.

In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the &quot;knuckleball&quot; technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo&#x27;s unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: &quot;People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying &#x27;All eyes on me&#x27; and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.&quot;

At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid&#x27;s counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a &quot;false&quot;, &quot;attacking&quot;, or &quot;goalscoring winger&quot;, as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.

In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates&#x27; crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.

=== Reception and image ===

Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Argentina forward Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations. In a 2018 article for &quot;Bleacher Report&quot;, former NBA star Steve Nash compared Ronaldo to Michael Jordan: &quot;On the pitch, [Ronaldo&#x27;s] learned how to make his play—less explosive in individual movements—more successful for the team, and in that, I see the greatness of Jordan.&quot; In the same article, Ronaldo was ranked first in the ranking of the 50 most influential people in sports culture for 2018.
Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and &quot;extraordinary commitment to physical preparation&quot;, Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: &quot;Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo&#x27;s focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.&quot; While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano&#x27;s approach to training, arguing that &quot;there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.&quot; His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in and . At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to &quot;his relative immobility&quot; in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.

During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an &quot;arrogant image&quot; on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a &quot;victim&quot; because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.

=== Goal celebrations ===
Ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a &quot;storming jump&quot; and &quot;turn&quot;, before &quot;landing in spread-eagled fashion&quot; into his &quot;signature power stance&quot;, while usually simultaneously exclaiming &quot;Sí&quot; (Spanish and Italian for &quot;yes&quot;). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the &quot;Siu&quot; or siuuu in the media. It has also been known as &quot;suiii&quot;, &quot;siiuuu&quot;, &quot;siii&quot; or &quot;Right Here Right Now&quot;, formally the Cristiano Ronaldo celebration. Since Ronaldo first performed the gesture in 2013, it has been widely imitated by athletes and personalities both in and outside of football when celebrating scoring in respective sports or a significant achievement, and is widely regarded as the most iconic association football celebration of all time.

The gesture was first performed by Ronaldo on 7 August, during the 2013 International Champions Cup Final between Real Madrid and Chelsea. Ronaldo gave Madrid a 2–1 lead with a free kick when he headed in a cross from Isco, helping Madrid beat Chelsea 3–1 to claim the International Champions Cup and celebrating with his first &quot;Siuuu&quot;. During an interview after the match against Chelsea when he first performed the gesture, Ronaldo explained he scored the goal and &quot;it just felt natural&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t know where it came from&quot;. He started doing it more often and when the supporters see it they are reminded of him.

The phrase &quot;siu&quot; is derived from Portuguese &quot;sim&quot;, meaning &quot;yes&quot;. This was confirmed by Ronaldo in an interview in 2023, almost a decade since he first performed it. Ronaldo explained that the phrase &quot;Siuuu&quot; simply means yes, but &quot;meaning it very strongly&quot;.

=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===
Both Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals, have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season, and are the two leading goal scorers in history. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.
In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: &quot;I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.&quot; Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo&#x27;s manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: &quot;I don&#x27;t think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.&quot; Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was &quot;only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I&#x27;ve never fought with Cristiano.&quot; Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: &quot;We don&#x27;t have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don&#x27;t with a lot of other players.&quot; Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: &quot;We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it&#x27;s a good thing.&quot; Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world&#x27;s biggest club game, &quot;El Clásico&quot;, which is among the world&#x27;s most viewed annual sporting events.

In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming &quot;one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.&quot; Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter&#x27;s &quot;commander&quot; on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men&#x27;s Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: &quot;I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it&#x27;s good to be part of the history of football.&quot;

After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi settled the debate between the two players. In September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and &quot;gone&quot;, after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of &quot;sharing the stage&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
=== Popularity and online following ===

Ronaldo was named in the 2014 Time 100, &quot;Time&quot;″s annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world&#x27;s most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Demand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo&#x27;s number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo&#x27;s number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi&#x27;s number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.

Ronaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers. The most-followed person on Facebook (171 million), most-followed on Instagram (650 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (115 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017. After announcing the creation of his YouTube channel, UR Cristiano on 21 August 2024, it became the fastest to reach the 1 million subscribers milestone, doing so in 90 minutes. The channel also became the fastest to reach 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 million subscribers. It also became the most subscribed channel in Portugal, surpassing the Portuguese Nick Jr. Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo&#x27;s name first on the list.

=== Wealth and sponsorships ===
With earnings of €720 million (£615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in &quot;Forbes&quot; list of the decade&#x27;s highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. &quot;Forbes&quot; twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world&#x27;s highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013–14 and $79 million in 2014–15. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine&#x27;s list of The World&#x27;s Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016–17. He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career.

Ronaldo is one of the world&#x27;s most marketable sportsmen: &quot;SportsPro&quot; rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. Since his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of &quot;FIFA&quot; video game &quot;FIFA 18&quot; and was heavily involved in the game&#x27;s promotion. His &quot;Sii&quot; goal celebration features in the &quot;FIFA&quot; series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot;, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.

=== Philanthropy ===

Ronaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother&#x27;s life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.

In 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer. In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA&#x27;s &quot;11 for Health&quot; programme to raise awareness among kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children&#x27;s new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity. In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.

Ronaldo was named the world&#x27;s most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating £5 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people. In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his €600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August of the same year, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.

=== Eponyms and honours ===
In 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team União da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Belém Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry &quot;to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.&quot; In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.

On 23 July 2016, following Portugal&#x27;s triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. On 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP&#x27;s football academy in Alcochete, until then called &quot;Academia Sporting&quot;, was renamed &quot;Academia Cristiano Ronaldo&quot;. In 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is &quot;a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city&quot;.

=== Public art ===

In June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pelé, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.

The unveiling of the rebranded Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust&#x27;s likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.

=== Business ventures ===
Ronaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name &quot;CR7&quot; (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his &quot;CR7&quot; fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, &quot;Legacy&quot;, in a partnership with Eden Parfums. Since 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (&quot;Correio da Manhã&quot;, &quot;Record&quot; and &quot;Jornal de Negócios&quot; publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Expressão Livre. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called &quot;Heads Up with Cristiano&quot;, created by developer RockLive, and in December 2013, he launched &quot;Viva Ronaldo&quot;, a dedicated social networking website and app.

=== Media ===
Ronaldo&#x27;s autobiography, titled &quot;Moments&quot;, was published in 2007. His sponsor Castrol produced the television film &quot;Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit&quot;, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film&#x27;s release in September 2011. &quot;Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet&quot;, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014. A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled &quot;Ronaldo&quot;, was released on 9 November 2015.

== Personal life ==
=== Family, children, and relationships ===
Ronaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo&#x27;s five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.

Ronaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected another set of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.

Ronaldo&#x27;s father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.

In January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that &quot;the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract&quot;, but Saudi authorities have begun to &quot;turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime&quot;.

Ronaldo is of (one-eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Catholic.

After her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.

=== Health ===
Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.

=== Legal issues ===
In July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.

Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.

In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo&#x27;s lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an &quot;intentional defamation campaign&quot; with parts significantly &quot;altered and/or completely fabricated&quot;, a claim which &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; categorically denied. In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: &quot;Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought £56 million in damages from Ronaldo. In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman&#x27;s lawyer, Leslie Stovall, &quot;acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute&quot; the case, despite the documents containing &quot;privileged communications&quot; between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo&#x27;s lawyers having &quot;intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement&quot; during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman&#x27;s rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall&#x27;s repeated use of &quot;cyber-hacked attorney–client privileged documents&quot; were actions representing &quot;abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process&quot;.

<text>Dumbleyung is a town and shire in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, south-east of Perth between Wagin and Lake Grace on State Route 107.

==History==
Dumbleyung&#x27;s name is of Noongar origin, coming from &quot;Dambeling&quot; which possibly means &quot;large lake or inland sea&quot; (although another source suggests it came from &quot;dumbung&quot;, a game played with bent sticks and a hard piece of fruit. The lake nearby was discovered and named Dambeling Lake by explorers Henry Landor and Henry Maxwell Lefroy in 1843, and the current spelling was used by surveyors in the 1860s and 1870s. Pastoralists and sandalwood cutters moved into the area, initially settling at Nippering, north of Lake Dumbleyung and west of the present town.

The first three families to settle in the area were the Cronin, Kersley and Bartram families. George Kersley, Sr. and his future son-in-law Henry Bartram were from pioneer families of the Beverley district and they used to take their sheep flocks from Beverley to Lake Dumbleyung for grazing. In 1875 Kersley received the first grazing leases and the Cronin family from Cork Ireland settled at &quot;Bunkin&quot; in 1878. Bartram settled his young family at &quot;Wheatfield&quot; on the edge of the Lake in 1886.

However, in 1907, Dumbleyung was gazetted as a townsite and became the terminus of a railway line from Wagin.

Tenders were called for the construction of an Agricultural Hall in 1909, and it was completed by 1910. The National Bank temporarily opened its town branch in the hall.

By 1915, Dumbleyung had grown to become the major rural service town in the region.

==Present day==

The nearby Dumbleyung Lake is a well-known attraction. The lake is famous for Donald Campbell breaking the world water speed record there in 1964 in his boat, &quot;Bluebird&quot;.
Dumbleyung itself is a service centre with a post office, school, tavern, public library, caravan park and other facilities. Both the tavern and roadhouse offer counter meals. The community used to host the Bluebird Festival each November, though it was discontinued and effectively replaced by the &#x27;Taste of Dumbleyung&#x27; event; the festival showcases the produce of the region alongside local entertainment attracting visitors to the town each April.

The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.

<doc id="623739" wikidata="Q1019146" url="?curid=623739" title="Ramathaim-Zophim">
<text>Ramathaim-Zophim (), also called Ramah () and Ramatha in the Douay–Rheims Bible translation (Ramathaimsophim in the Vulgate), is a city from the Hebrew Bible, the home town and resting place of prophet Samuel. The name of the town means &quot;the heights of the views.&quot;

==Identification==
Ramah, the home of Elkanah, Samuel&#x27;s father (), the birthplace of Samuel and the seat of his authority (), the town is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet and of David (). Here Samuel died and was buried ().

The historian Josephus distinguishes between Ramathaim, &quot;a city of the tribe of Ephraim,&quot; and Ramah, the burial place of Samuel the prophet, but he does not explicitly say that these were two different places.

Ramathaim-Zophim has been tentatively identified with one of two sites. One of them is the modern Palestinian village of Nabi Samwil, the other the former village, now town, of er-Ram.

===Er-Ram as Ramah===
Ramah, according to Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Onomasticon&quot;, was located 6 milestones north of Jerusalem (Ailia), opposite Bethel. Accordingly, Ramah is now thought by many historical geographers to be Er Ram, about 8 km north of Jerusalem.

The Survey of Western Palestine identifies er-Ram with Ramah of Benjamin from .

===Nabi Samwil as Ramah===
Nabi Samwil stands about 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem, and is held by an originally Christian tradition dating back to the Byzantine period to be the resting place of the prophet Samuel). The site comprises what is now the Israeli Nebi Samuel National Park, with its most prominent feature being a two-storey Crusader fortress, now used as a mosque and a Jewish Orthodox synagogue.

Benjamin of Tudela visited Nabi Samwil when he travelled the land in 1173, noting that the Crusaders had found the bones of Samuel in a Jewish cemetery in Ramla on the coastal plain and reburied them here, on the hill overlooking the Holy City. C. R. Conder, of the Palestine Exploration Fund, discredits this tradition.

===Ramallah as Ramathaim-Zophim===
C. R. Conder of the Palestine Exploration Fund raised the hypothesis that, because of its high elevation and how that it affords a good prospect of the surrounding region, Ramathaim-Zophim may have been Ramallah.

===Nabi Samwil as Mizpah===
The traditional tomb site of Samuel the prophet, which became known as Neby Samwil (&quot;the prophet Samuel&quot;), may have been Mizpah in Benjamin, where Samuel was appointed leader of the Israelites (). Such was the view of Edward Robinson who visited the site in 1838, and who vehemently objected to identifying Neby Samwil with the Ramah of Samuel. Conder and Kitchener of the Palestine Exploration Fund described the site in their days as being &quot;a small hamlet of mud hovels.&quot;

Judas Machabeus, preparing for war with the Syrians, gathered his men at Mizpah, over against Jerusalem: for in Mizpah was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel.

===Arimathea===
Some, e.g. Petrus Comestor (ca. 1100–1179) in his &quot;Historia Scholastica&quot;, Cap. CLXXX: De sepultura Domini, have identified Ramathaim-Zophim as Arimathea of the New Testament.

<text>The Voyage of the Space Beagle (1950) is a science fiction novel by American writer A. E. van Vogt. An example of space opera subgenre, the novel is a &quot;fix-up&quot; compilation of four previously published stories:

*&quot;Black Destroyer&quot; (cover story of the July 1939 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine—the first published SF by A. E. van Vogt) (chapters 1 to 6)
*&quot;War of Nerves&quot; (May 1950, &quot;Other Worlds&quot; magazine) (chapters 9 to 12)
*&quot;Discord in Scarlet&quot; (cover story of the December 1939 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine—the second published SF by A. E. van Vogt) (chapters 13 to 21)
*&quot;M33 in Andromeda&quot; (August 1943, &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine, later published as a story in the book &quot;M33 in Andromeda&quot; (1971)) (chapters 22 to 28)

In the novel, a huge globular spaceship, populated by a chemically castrated all-male crew of almost a thousand, who are on an extended scientific mission to explore intergalactic space, encounters several, mostly hostile, aliens and alien civilizations. On board the spaceship during its journey, both political and scientific revolutions take place.

The title of the book is a reference to &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;, Charles Darwin&#x27;s book about his five-year voyage around the world on . The book was republished in 1952 under the title &quot;Mission: Interplanetary&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The main protagonist of the novel is Dr. Elliott Grosvenor, the only Nexialist on board (a new discipline depicted as taking an actively generalist approach towards science). It is Grosvenor&#x27;s training and application of Nexialism rather than the more narrow-minded approaches of the individual scientific and military minds of his other shipmates that consistently prove more effective against the hostile encounters both from outside and within the &quot;Space Beagle&quot;. He is eventually forced to take control of the ship using a combination of hypnotism, psychology, brainwashing, and persuasion, in order to develop an effective strategy for defeating the alien entity Anabis and saving the ship and our galaxy.

The book can be roughly divided into four sections corresponding to the four short stories on which it was based:

In the first section, the &quot;Space Beagle&quot; lands on a largely deserted desolate planet. Small scattered herds of deer-like creatures are seen, and the ancient ruins of cities litter the landscape. Coeurl, a starving, intelligent and vicious cat-like carnivore with tentacles on its shoulders, approaches the ship, pretending to be an unintelligent animal, and quickly infiltrates it. The creature kills several crewmen before being tricked into leaving the now spaceborne ship in a lifeboat. It then commits suicide when it realizes it has been defeated.

In the second part, the ship is almost destroyed by internal warfare caused by telepathic contact with a race of bird-like aliens, called Riim. The benign signals that the Riim send are incompatible with the human mind. Only Grosvenor&#x27;s knowledge of telepathic phenomena saves the ship from destruction.

In the third section, the ship comes across Ixtl, a scarlet being floating in deep space. It is a vicious survivor of a race that ruled a previous universe before the Big Bang, the creation of our own universe. Ixtl boards the ship, and being obsessed with its own reproduction, kidnaps several crew members in order to implant parasitic eggs in their stomachs. It is eventually tricked into leaving the ship, after all the crew have left the ship temporarily, leaving no prey left for its offspring to feed on.

In the last section, Anabis, a galaxy-spanning consciousness, is encountered. Once again, it is both malevolent, starving and aggressive, and under all circumstances must be prevented from following the ship back to any other galaxy. Anabis, which is essentially a galaxy-size will-o&#x27;-the-wisp, feeds off the death of living organisms, and has destroyed all intelligent life in its galaxy. It transforms all planets it can find into jungle planets through terraforming, since it is these kind of worlds that produce most life. The crew of the &quot;Space Beagle&quot; lures the intelligence to chase the ship into deep space, causing it to starve to death.

Running concurrently to this, the book also covers a power struggle on the ship among the leaders of individual scientific and military groups.

==Reception==

P. Schuyler Miller, while praising the original stories, found that the rewriting needed to stitch them into an original novel was inadequate, so that &quot;the whole is less than its original parts.&quot;

The novel was reprinted in 2008. The critic Joe Milicia took the opportunity of this re-issue to revisit the novel in a comprehensive review for the&quot; New York Review of Science Fiction&quot;. Milicia looks at what today’s reader might find in the novel, noting:
Among the surprises identified by Milicia that it may hold for the modern reader are the disharmony aboard the &quot;Space Beagle&quot; (&quot;Clearly, Machiavelli rather than Darwin is the true spirit guiding the &quot;Space Beagle&quot;&quot;), and that the &quot;Space Beagle&quot;’s mission is like the original &quot;Beagle&quot;&#x27;s and very unlike the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s.

==References in other works==
A sentient panther-like species named Coeurl (or Zorl in French editions), with psi capabilities and tentacles coming out of its shoulders, was adapted as the character Mughi (or Mugi) in the anime &quot;Dirty Pair&quot;. It also appears in several versions of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video games, and as the Displacer beast in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. The Coeurl suck phosphorus (&quot;id&quot;) from their victims; the &quot;salt vampire&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Man Trap&quot; removes sodium.

At first glance, the alien Ixtl also appears to be an inspiration for the film &quot;Alien&quot;, though those involved with the film denied any influence on its part. A lawsuit Van Vogt initiated against 20th Century Fox for plagiarism was settled out of court, the details of which were never disclosed.

The third section of the book, &quot;Discord in Scarlet&quot; was given a comics adaptation (under the title &quot;Voyage of the Space Beagle&quot;) in the February 1983 issue of &quot;Eerie&quot;. Rich Margopoulos and Luis Bermejo are the credited writer and artist, with Bermejo&#x27;s Ixtl rendition bearing a more-than-passing similarity to Giger&#x27;s design.

The book was translated into several languages and, as was the case for most of van Vogt&#x27;s work, was very popular in France. In Japan it is noted that Korita, the character who explains the demise of the first monster, is Japanese, and presented without racist slights.

Two of the races, the Riim (pp 82–83) and the Ixtl (pp 52–53) are depicted in &quot;Barlowe&#x27;s Guide to Extraterrestrials&quot;.

In David Gerrold&#x27;s Chtorr novel &quot;A Season for Slaughter,&quot; a robot probe called a &quot;prowler&quot; is used. The prowler makes a distinctive &quot;coeurl&quot; sound, described several times as &quot;the prowler coeurled on&quot;. The reference to the Coeurl in the first story of the &quot;Voyage of the Space Beagle&quot;, where the phrase &quot;Coeurl prowled on&quot; occurs, is unmistakable.

A hologram called a &quot;prowler&quot; appears as one of the distractions employed by the &quot;Enterprise&quot; lieutenant Kevin Riley to surprise the deck crew of the &quot;Voyager&quot; worldship in David Gerrold&#x27;s Star Trek novel &quot;The Galactic Whirlpool&quot;. It is a friendly, weirdly-colored, balloon-like hologram that makes a distinctive &quot;coeurl&quot; sound (&quot;Riley stepped up to the illusion and said, &#x27;Command: Prowl! Activate.&#x27; &#x27;Coeurl,&#x27; said the prowler, nodding to nuzzle Riley wetly, then it turned and lumbered down the corridor. &#x27;Coeurl? Coeurl?&#x27; it called as it disappeared into the gloom. On and on the prowler called, until finally it disappeared into the murk of distance. Kirk looked at Riley. &#x27;Good job, Lieutenant. Uh- where is it going now?).

<doc id="623751" wikidata="Q5605833" url="?curid=623751" title="Greg Kihn">
<text>Gregory Stanley Kihn (; July 10, 1949 – August 13, 2024) was an American rock musician, radio personality, and novelist. He founded and led the Greg Kihn Band and he wrote several popular horror novels. He is best known for the hits &quot;The Breakup Song (They Don&#x27;t Write &#x27;Em)&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Jeopardy&quot; in 1983.

==Career==
===Early influences===
Kihn&#x27;s early influence was the Beatles and their appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. &quot;Just about every rock and roll musician my age can point to one cultural event that inspired him to take up music in the first place: The Beatles on Ed Sullivan. If you were a shy 14-year-old kid who already had a guitar, it was a life-altering event... In a single weekend everything had changed. I&#x27;d come home from school the previous Friday looking like Dion. I went back to class on Monday morning with my hair dry and brushed forward. That&#x27;s how quickly it happened.&quot;

Kihn began his career in his hometown of Baltimore, working in the singer/songwriter mold. But he switched to straightforward rock and roll when he moved to San Francisco in 1974. He started writing songs and playing coffee houses while still in high school in the Baltimore area. When Kihn was 17, his mother submitted a tape of one of his original songs to the talent contest of the big local Top 40 radio station, WCAO 600 AM. Kihn took first prize and won three things that would change his life: a typewriter, a stack of records, and a Vox electric guitar.

===Relocation to California===
After his move to California, Kihn worked at painting houses, singing in the streets, and the behind the counter job at Berkeley record store Rather Ripped Records. His co-worker was future bandmate and Earth Quake guitarist Gary Phillips. The next year, Kihn became one of the first artists signed to Matthew King Kaufman&#x27;s Beserkley Records. Along with Jonathan Richman, Earth Quake, and the Rubinoos, Kihn helped to carve the label&#x27;s sound—melodic pop with a strong 1960s pop sensibility—an alternative to the progressive rock of the time. 

In 1976, after his debut on the compilation album &quot;Beserkley Chartbusters&quot;, he recorded his first album with his own ensemble called the Greg Kihn Band. The group consisted of Robbie Dunbar (guitar), Steve Wright (bass), and Larry Lynch (drums). Dunbar, already a member of Earth Quake, was replaced by Dave Carpender in time to record their second album, &quot;Greg Kihn Again&quot;. Meanwhile, Kihn&#x27;s old record store pal, Gary Phillips, who had contributed guitar work to Kihn&#x27;s first album, returned as a session musician on the band&#x27;s &quot;Glass House Rock&quot; (1980) album. He officially joined the band as keyboardist for the follow-up album, &quot;RocKihnRoll&quot; (1981). The lineup of Kihn, Wright, Lynch, Phillips, and Carpender lasted until 1983, when Greg Douglass replaced Dave Carpender.

===&quot;The Breakup Song&quot;===
Through the 1970s, Kihn released an album each year and built a strong cult following through constant touring. The Greg Kihn Band became Beserkley&#x27;s biggest seller. In 1981, he earned his first big hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;The Breakup Song (They Don&#x27;t Write &#x27;Em),&quot; from the &quot;RocKihnRoll&quot; album. The song reached No. 15 on the charts and was frequently heard on album rock FM stations. 

Kihn continued in a more commercial vein through the 1980s with a series of pun-titled albums: &quot;Kihntinued&quot; (1982), &quot;Kihnspiracy&quot; (1983), &quot;Kihntagious&quot; (1984), and &quot;Citizen Kihn&quot; (1985).

===&quot;Jeopardy&quot;===
Kihn scored his biggest hit with &quot;Jeopardy,&quot; which reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, from the &quot;Kihnspiracy&quot; album. The 1983 groundbreaking &quot;Jeopardy&quot; video became an MTV favorite. In the video, Kihn plays a would-be groom with fears about getting married. &quot;Jeopardy&quot; received heavy airplay on the fledgling cable music channel and spawned countless imitators.

Many of the videos that followed were sequels with connecting story lines. &quot;Jeopardy&quot; was spoofed by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic as &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy&quot;, in subject of Al appearing the on the Jeopardy! game show the track was featured on Yankovic&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;in 3D&quot;, later that same year Jeopardy! made a comeback to syndicated nighttime television, Kihn said he was flattered to be parodied, and appeared at the end of the video driving a convertible with the license plate &quot;LOSER.&quot; (In a radio interview, Kihn commented that he received &quot;a nice check&quot; from Weird Al&#x27;s record company every month.)

=== &quot;Rendezvous&quot; ===
In 1979, Kihn released his cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, a song which didn&#x27;t make the cut for Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; LP. Springsteen had admired Kihn&#x27;s distinctive recording of &quot;For You&quot; so much that he sought out Kihn after a concert and gave him a cassette with the &quot;Rendezvous&quot; outtake, the lyrics, and permission to record the song, which Kihn did on his 1979 LP &quot;With the Naked Eye.&quot;

===1980s===
For most of the 1980s Kihn toured frequently, opening arena-sized shows for groups including Journey, the Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones. Kihn often appeared on TV during this period on shows such as &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. On May 10, 1981, Kihn and Willie Nile appeared live on the &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot; from the Savoy Theater in New York City. 

In 1985, Kihn broke with Beserkley Records and signed with EMI. Matthew Kaufman continued to produce Kihn&#x27;s albums. &quot;Lucky&quot; (1985) reached a modest No. 30 on the Hot 100 and spawned a splashy video sequel to the popular &quot;Jeopardy&quot; video. In 1986, Joe Satriani replaced Greg Douglass on lead guitar, Tyler Eng replaced Larry Lynch on drums, and Gary Phillips left with Pat Mosca taking over on keyboards. That is the lineup which recorded the album &quot;Love and Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (1986).

===Radio DJ and author===
From 1996 through 2012, Kihn was a morning radio disc jockey (DJ). He did wake-ups for KUFX, a Bay Area classic rock radio station. 

He also began a literary career in 1996 with the release of his first novel, &quot;Horror Show&quot;, published by Tor/Forge Books. &quot;Horror Show&quot; was nominated for the prestigious Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel. It was followed by &quot;Shade of Pale&quot; (1997), &quot;Big Rock Beat&quot; (1998), and &quot;Mojo Hand&quot; (1999). He published many short stories during this period, some appearing in the &quot;Hot Blood&quot; series of erotic horror fiction. Kihn was contributing editor to &quot;Carved in Rock&quot;, a compilation of short fiction by musicians including Pete Townshend, Joan Jett, Ray Davies, and Kinky Friedman. 

The Greg Kihn Band continued to play with a line-up comprising Kihn&#x27;s son Ry Kihn on lead guitar, Dave Danza (from Eddie Money) on drums, Dave Medd (from the Tubes) on keyboards, and Robert Berry (from Hush) on bass. Kihn was inducted into San Jose Rocks Hall of Fame in 2007.

In September 2013, Music Life Radio interviewed Kihn about his music, radio, and writing careers.

Kihn&#x27;s last album, &quot;ReKihndled&quot;, was released in 2017. He continued to perform live as late as December 2019.

===Personal life and death===
Kihn was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to parents Stanley J. Kihn, a city Health Department inspector who fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II, and Jane (Gregorek) Kihn.

Kihn had two children, son Ry, a guitarist; and Lexi, a nurse. Kihn was of Polish descent.

Kihn died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the San Francisco Bay Area, on August 13, 2024, at the age of 75.

===Charity work and volunteerism===

Kihn did charity work for &quot;Operation Care and Comfort&quot;, a military support group responsible for sending care packages to hundreds of military units deployed in harm&#x27;s way . He was nominated for the 2010 “Man of the Year Award” by the Lymphoma Society and performed for Children&#x27;s Hospital in Oakland, California, in the fight against cancer.

==Discography==
==Author==

Kihn wrote four horror fiction novels, beginning with &quot;Horror Show&quot; (1996), which was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel, followed by &quot;Shade of Pale&quot; (1997). &quot;Big Rock Beat&quot; and &quot;Mojo Hand&quot; were released as sequels to &quot;Horror Show&quot;.

He released &quot;Carved in Rock: Short Stories by Musicians&quot;, a collection of short stories written by him and other well-known rock musicians including Pete Townshend, Graham Parker, Joan Jett, and Ray Davies. In 2013, Kihn released &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, a murder mystery novel featuring the Beatles.

<text>William Warren Allmand (September 19, 1932 – December 7, 2016) was a Canadian politician who served as a Member of Parliament in the Parliament of Canada from 1965 to 1997. A member of the Liberal Party, he represented the Montreal riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1972 to 1979. As Solicitor General, Allmand introduced legislation that successfully abolished the death penalty in Canada in 1976.

After leaving federal politics, Allmand took on the role of human rights activist, and led the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development and the World Federalist Movement-Canada. He briefly returned to politics by serving a term from 2005 to 2009 as a Montreal city councillor under Gérald Tremblay&#x27;s Union Montreal party, becoming vice president of the city council. Allmand died on December 7, 2016, from terminal brain cancer.

==Early life and career==
William Warren Allmand was born in Montreal on September 19, 1932, and was raised in the Mile End neighbourhood. He had a Jesuit education at Loyola College in Montreal. He attended St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, and graduated in 1954 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics.

Allmand studied civil law at McGill University, and graduated in 1957 with a bachelor of civil law degree. During his time at McGill, he was the chairman of the faculty of education in 1956–57. He was also a member of the university&#x27;s Newman Club and played three years of varsity ice hockey for the McGill Redmen. After graduation, Allmand was admitted into the Quebec bar in 1958. He also earned certificates in comparative law at the University of Paris and at the Institute of Comparative Law.

==Federal politics==
In the 1965 federal election, Allmand ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in the Montreal riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, and was elected to the Parliament of Canada. He would serve his constituency for over 30 years, being re-elected in every subsequent election before stepping down in 1997.

As a backbencher, Allmand was a strong advocate for stronger gun laws in Canada, supporting regulations on all Canadian gun owners and limiting access to all guns, including those for hunting. In 1971, he proposed a bill to only permit government stores to sell guns. The bill also proposed an application process which included a waiting period during which the gun purchase was publicly listed to allow anyone to object. Allmand also proposed requiring gun owners to compile annual reports on their gun use and the condition of the gun, and to return their guns to the government when no longer used. Allmand continued to advocate for gun control laws upon his appointment to cabinet.

In 1967, after Charles de Gaulle said &quot;Vive le Québec libre&quot; while on a state visit to Canada during Expo 67, Allmand sent a message to Paul Martin Sr., the External Affairs Minister, that the rest of the trip must be cancelled.

=== Solicitor General ===
Allmand was sworn into the Privy Council on November 27, 1972 when he succeeded Jean-Pierre Goyer as Solicitor General for Pierre Trudeau, a post he held until September 13, 1976. Serving in the aftermath of the October Crisis, he testified before the Keable commission, which examined police misconduct.

In 1976, Allmand signed a warrant requested by Michael Dare, the Director-General of Royal Canadian Mounted Police Security Service, to authorize them to intercept the mail of a Toronto couple. The couple were suspected of conspiring with the Japanese Red Army, possibly to attack the upcoming 1976 Summer Olympics. After the Department of Justice advised Allmand it was a violation of the &quot;Post Office Act&quot;, it was cancelled in December 1976, nine months after it had been granted.

In December 1976, Allmand was Solicitor General when Leonard Peltier was extradited to the United States. According to Allmand, the Federal Bureau of Investigation submitted false information to the Canadian government, including an affidavit from a woman with mental disorders who claimed to be Peltier&#x27;s girlfriend.

In 1977, after Allmand was no longer Solicitor General, he testified before the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP (the McDonald Commission) that the RCMP had advised him that it was legal for them to break into buildings to conduct warrantless searches as long as they did not take anything. Allmand would later state that the RCMP had been dishonest in withholding information from him and other solicitors general.

==== Abolishing the death penalty ====
After Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals upgraded their minority government to a majority in the 1974 federal election, they had more leeway to act on abolishing capital punishment. In 1973, Liberals had renewed the provisions of Bill C-168, passed by Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s minority government in 1968, which imposed a five-year moratorium on the use of the death penalty. With a majority behind them, Allmand and Trudeau, both ardent abolitionists, prepared to go further than Pearson had gone and decided to try and abolish the death penalty altogether.

Allmand felt it was hypocritical to have the law on the books when Parliament had commuted every death sentence since 1962. He also felt that it was illegitimate to grant the Cabinet and the judiciary the power over an individual person&#x27;s ultimate fate, noting that it is not in line with the values held by Canadian society. Because of these views, Canada&#x27;s official hangman called for his resignation.

In 1976 Allmand tabled Bill C-84, &quot;An Act to Amend the Criminal Code in Relation to the Punishment for Murder and Certain Other Serious Offences,&quot; the bill that would remove the death penalty from the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; and abolish its use in Canada. A sentence of life imprisonment with no chance of parole for a minimum of 25 years was substituted instead. 119 parliamentarians spoke for or against the bill over the course of the debate, with members of both the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties divided in their support of the bill.

Opponents of the bill cited recent polling that 70% of Canadians supported capital punishment and called on the government to call a national referendum on the issue. Other opponents accused Allmand and Trudeau of proposing the bill now so that it would not expire before the next federal election in 1979 and risk costing the Liberals votes. Almost all opponents thought that the death penalty was a necessary response to terrorism, insurrection, and other serious crimes. Former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker argued that after the Munich massacre, passing Bill C-84 was sending the wrong message in the lead-up to the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. In response to the calls for referendum, including a motion for a national plebiscite by Alberta MP Gordon Towers, Allmand argued that the role of MPs was to deliberate in the House of Commons, make up their own minds, and then vote. He also argued that representative democracy necessarily excluded plebiscites, because then it would open the door to plebiscites on a variety of serious and controversial issues.

In order not to risk the fall of the government over the bill given its contentious nature, Allmand and Trudeau agreed that the final vote would be a free vote. Despite the Liberal majority in the House of Commons, it only narrowly passed Bill C-84, 131 to 124.

A year after the vote, Allmand remarked in a speech delivered to Amnesty International, that &quot;Capital punishment, simply because it is immoral and useless, must be fought and defeated if we are to become a world society in which our descendants can live in peace and justice.&quot;

=== Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development ===
After being Solicitor General, Allmand continued to serve in the cabinet of Pierre Trudeau as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development from September 14, 1976 to September 15, 1977. While the Minister of Indian Affairs, Allmand was seen as particularly sensitive to the need to use appropriate language and have equitable relations with Indigenous Peoples in Canada. By taking the treaties with Indigenous Peoples at face value and extending the benefit of doubt to the people subject to the treaties, Allmand extended the rule of law to Indigenous witnesses in a largely unprecedented manner.

Unlike his predecessor Judd Buchanan, who referred to the land claims and demands for Indigenous self-government proposed by the Dene people in the Dene Declaration in the aftermath of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry as &quot;goobledegook&quot;, Allmand expressed public sympathy for their political demands of the Dene and the Métis. He was seemingly about to reach a land claim settlement agreement which would have granted much of the desired political autonomy when he was replaced by Hugh Faulkner in fall 1977. Faulkner backed away from the concessions that Allmand had made such as control over natural resources, instead proposing a cash settlement and land allotments similar to Indian reserves. This new position was criticized by the Dene and Métis leaders, and talks would not resume until 1981.

His final cabinet post was as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs from September 16, 1977 until June 3, 1979, when the Liberals were defeated and Progressive Conservative Joe Clark formed government after the 1979 federal election.

=== Opposition and return to backbenches ===
In October 1979, Allmand was forced to borrow a tie from an NDP MP when the Speaker of the House of Commons refused to recognize him to ask a question because he was &quot;improperly dressed&quot; in a turtleneck sweater with his suit instead of a tie. Allmand unsuccessfully challenged the ruling.

During the negotiations leading up to the patriation of the Constitution of Canada, Allmand, frequently suggested to his caucus colleagues, including those on the committee overseeing patriation, that the rights of Indigenous Peoples should be explicitly protected in any new constitution. Allmand&#x27;s support lent credibility to the Indigenous cause, since he was a former Indian Affairs minister and longtime cabinet minister. Ultimately, Allmand voted against the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; because of his opposition to the inclusion of the notwithstanding clause in Section 33 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that allowed certain rights to be overridden by the national and provincial legislatures. He opposed Section 59 of the act, which delayed the implementation of Section 23 minority language education rights in the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; in Quebec until a time chosen by the Quebec National Assembly. After this vote, Allmand would never hold a Liberal cabinet position again.

During Brian Mulroney&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, Allmand held numerous Official Opposition critic portfolios. He was critic for Employment from October 1984 to September 1990. In 1988, conservative Catholics attacked Allmand for being &quot;anti-life&quot; for voting against amendments to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; that would have criminalized abortion in Canada. Allmand, himself a Catholic, defended himself, saying that while he personally opposed the act of abortion, he did not believe abortion should be included in criminal law. Allmand was critic for arms control and disarmament as well as critic for Official Languages from 1990 to 1992, and critic for Immigration from 1992 to 1993. During this time, Allmand, who was the chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet, hosted the 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s first visit to Canada in 1990.

In 1995, he gained notoriety for voting against Minister of Finance Paul Martin&#x27;s budget, as he was opposed to spending cuts that were deeper than promised during the 1993 election and because it did not cancel the Goods and Services Tax. As a result, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien removed him from his position as chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice, a position he held from January 17, 1994 to February 2, 1996, although he remained in the Liberal caucus. Allmand said that Martin&#x27;s budget cuts &quot;broke traditional Liberal principles&quot; and his willingness to vote against his own party&#x27;s majority government emboldened other Liberal MPs to follow suit, such as John Nunziata and Dennis Mills.

He retired before the 1997 election after Chrétien appointed him president of the Montreal-based International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development (later renamed Rights and Democracy) to replace Ed Broadbent, its first president.

== Human rights activism ==
Allmand served as the second president of the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development from 1997 to 2002. During the 3rd Summit of the Americas, held in Quebec City in 2001, Allmand encouraged social activists boycotting the event to speak with governmental actors in order to collaboratively develop better policy. During his time at the centre, Allmand supported the work done on the International Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.

In the leadup to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Allmand was an active participant in the negotiations via the Coalition for Peace in Ireland. During the negotiations, Allmand met Rosemary Nolan, whom he married in 2002.

He also served as the international president of Parliamentarians for Global Action. In 2004, Allmand was elected President of the World Federalist Movement–Canada, a position he held until his terminal illness led to his replacement in August 2016 by Walter Dorn. Allmand also served as a director of the Newman Centre of Montreal and CANADEM.

In 2004, Allmand taught at McGill University as a visiting scholar at the Institute of Canadian Studies.

In 2005, Allmand served as counsel for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group during the Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Maher Arar, and argued that Canada&#x27;s national security agencies, especially the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, chose security over rights and were largely unaccountable when they did so.

== Montreal municipal politics ==
In November 2005, Allmand was elected to the Montreal city council seat as a member of the Union Montréal party to represent Loyola, in the Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough. Allmand&#x27;s primary motivation for joining was to help oversee the city&#x27;s implementation of its charter of rights that he had helped draft.

Although Allmand had been recruited by then mayor Gérald Tremblay for his party, he was not afraid to publicly criticize the mayor if he disagreed with city policy. Allmand voted against Tremblay&#x27;s motion to change the name of Park Avenue to Avenue Robert Bourassa. During his time on the council, he criticized the lack of transparency in urban planning for projects in his seat of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, while Michael Applebaum was mayor.

Although he had risen to become the Vice President of the Montreal City Council, he did not choose to run again in the 2009 Montreal municipal election.

== Later activities and death ==
In 2011, Allmand supported the Canadian Boat for Gaza, part of the Freedom Flotilla II that sought to deliver supplies to Palestinians. In Fall 2013, Allmand joined Foundation Board of Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East.

In 2014, Allmand defended a legal argument, on behalf of the World Federalist Movement – Canada, that challenged the Canadian government&#x27;s implementation bill for the Convention on Cluster Munitions. He argued that a clause of the bill which gave Canada an explicit exemption in certain cases while participating in combined military operations with non-signatory allies such as the United States undermined the purpose of the convention. Allmand noted that Australia and New Zealand, two other American allies, had passed similar legislation without this exemption. Allmand was concerned that signing a treaty with the exception would encourage other countries to create their own exceptions.

Allmand was diagnosed with a brain tumour in February 2016, and his condition worsened in October 2016. He then entered a palliative care centre at the Centre hospitalier de l&#x27;Université de Montréal&#x27;s Hôpital Notre-Dame, where he died on December 7, 2016, at the age of 84. Allmand&#x27;s funeral was held at St. Patrick&#x27;s Basilica on December 19. Allmand was survived by his wife, a son and two daughters.

== Honours, awards, and legacy ==
In 1977, Allmand was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel for his contributions to the legal field. In 1990, the World Federalist Movement–Canada honoured Allmand with its World Peace Award. In 2000, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for being &quot;committed to democracy and the pursuit of justice and fundamental freedoms.&quot; In June 2006, Bishop&#x27;s University granted him a Doctor of Civil Law &quot;honoris causa&quot; at its convocation ceremony.

In 1999, in a list that Allmand submitted to the &quot;Great Canadian Book of Lists,&quot; he listed abolishing the death penalty as one of Canada&#x27;s twelve most significant political events.

After his death, Denis Coderre, the Mayor of Montreal, announced that the flags at Montreal City Hall would be flown at half-mast in his honour. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a statement on Twitter saying that Allmand&#x27;s &quot;legacy will live on in the enormous contributions he made to Canada as an MP and Minister.&quot;

In 2018, the Queen Elizabeth Health Complex, a non-profit in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce neighbourhood that Allmand represented, for which he served as a board member from 2001 until his death, renamed its urgent care waiting room in his honour as part of a fundraising initiative with the Warren Allmand Memorial Fund.

In January 2020, Montreal city councilors Marvin Rotrand and Lionel Perez submitted a motion requesting a public place to be renamed to honour Montreal. In August 2021, Somerled Park, near Royal Vale School in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, part of the constituency that he represented federally and municipally, was chosen to be renamed. In May 2023, the park was inaugurated under the new name of Warren Allmand Park.

== Published works ==
Allmand published at least three books during this career:
* &quot;Is there a future for progressive policies in Canada?&quot; Montréal : McGill Institute for the Study of Canada; 1997.
* &quot;Trading in human rights: the need for human rights sensitivity at the World Trade Organization.&quot; Montréal : International Centre for Human Rights &amp; Democratic Development; 1999.
* &quot;Troquer ou respecter les droits humains? Pour une Organisation mondiale du commerce soucieuse des droits humains.&quot; Montréal : Centre international des droits de la personne et du développement démocratique; 1999.

<text>Arimathea or Arimathaea () or Harimathaea or Harimathea (, &quot;Harimathaía&quot;) was a purported city of Judea. It was the reported home of Joseph of Arimathea, who appears in all four canonical Gospel accounts of the Passion of Jesus for having donated his new tomb outside Jerusalem to receive the body of Jesus (see Matt. 27:57–59; Mark 15:42–45; Luke 23:50–53; John 19:38–40). There is no external evidence for the existence of Arimathea, and some scholars suggest that it may have been a literary device used in the Gospel narrative.

==Identification==
===Roman era===
The Christian apologist and historian Eusebius of Caesarea, in his &quot;Onomasticon&quot; (144:28–29), identified it with Ramathaim-Zophim and wrote that it was near Diospolis (now Lod). Ramathaim-Zophim was a town in Ephraim, the birthplace of Samuel, where David came to him (1 Samuel 1). He briefly describes it as follows: &quot;Armthem Seipha (Sofim). City of Elcana and Samuel. It is situated (in the region of Thamna) near Diospolis. The home of Joseph who was from Arimathea in the Gospels.&quot;

Scholars of the &quot;Onomasticon&quot; have identified the Greek name Arimathea as deriving from the Hebrew place name of Ramathaim-Zophim (), which is attested in the Hebrew Bible and 1 Maccabees 11:34. It appeared in the Septuagint as &quot;Armathaim Sipha&quot; ().

===Byzantine era===
The town of Harmathemē () appears on the 6th-century Madaba Map. Casanowicz argues for its identification with Bani Zeid al-Gharbia in the West Bank.

===Crusader period===
The Crusaders seem to have identified Ramla with Ramathaim and Arimathea. Ramla was a medieval town founded around 705–715 by the Umayyad Caliphate, and located on land in what had once been the allotment of the Tribe of Dan.

<doc id="623760" wikidata="Q4809608" url="?curid=623760" title="Association of American Law Schools">
<text>The Association of American Law Schools (AALS), formed in 1900, is a non-profit organization of 175 law schools in the United States. An additional 19 schools pay a fee to receive services but are not members. AALS incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization in 1971. The association is a member of both the American Council on Education and the American Council of Learned Societies its headquarters are in Washington, D.C.

==History==
In August 1905, a new quarterly law publication was announced in the annual meeting held in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Henry Wade Rogers, dean of Yale Law School served as the president and 25 law schools were represented.

==Leadership==

Austen Parrish, dean of University of California, Irvine School of Law, became president of AALS on January 11, 2025. The president-elect is Danielle Conway, dean of Penn State Dickinson Law, and Melanie D. Wilson, dean of Washington and Lee University School of Law, is the immediate past president.

Kellye Y. Testy was named executive director and chief executive officer in January 2024 and started in the role in July 2024. Prior to joining AALS, Testy served as president and CEO of Law School Admission Council, dean of University of Washington School of Law and dean of Seattle University School of Law. 

Judith Areen served as executive director and chief executive officer of AALS from 2014 to 2024. Prior to coming to AALS, Areen was on the faculty of Georgetown University Law Center where she served as dean from 1989 to 2004 and as interim dean in 2010.

== Meetings==

AALS hosts a number of events throughout the year. The AALS Conference on Clinical Legal Education is the association&#x27;s second largest conference with the 2015 conference having approximately 700 clinicians in attendance. The conference&#x27;s sessions focus on practice areas and common areas of concern for clinicians.

== Publication ==
AALS publishes The &quot;Journal of Legal Education&quot;, which focuses on teaching methods, scholarship, and other issues facing legal education and the profession.

==Involvement in the Solomon Amendment==
The AALS requires its members to follow a nondiscrimination policy regarding &quot;race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, or sexual orientation,&quot; and for member law schools to require this of any employer to which it gives access for recruitment.

The United States Armed Forces&#x27; &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; (DADT) policy was seen by the AALS as impermissible discrimination. However, the AALS excused its members from blocking access to the military since the passage of the Solomon Amendment, which denies federal funding to the parent university of a law school as well as the school itself if military recruiters are not given full campus access. However, the AALS at the time required schools to take &quot;ameliorative&quot; measures when allowing military recruiters on campus, including placing &quot;warning&quot; signs on campus when military recruiting takes place, scheduling interviews off campus away from &quot;core&quot; areas, &quot;prohibit[ing] entirely the delivery of discretionary support services&quot; to military recruiters, charging military employers who use law school resources &quot;reasonable fees for use of law school staff, facilities and services,&quot; etc. The AALS at the time encouraged law schools to deny benefits to military recruiters that they would ordinarily provide employers, such as coffee and free parking. Specifically, the AALS wrote in a memo to all law school deans in the United States:

The AALS engaged in litigation challenging the Solomon Amendment as violative of the First Amendment (see e.g., &quot;Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.&quot;). In an interesting coincidence, The Judge Advocate General&#x27;s School of the United States Army is a fee-paying nonmember of AALS.

Although DADT has been ended, and although President Barack Obama called upon college campuses to welcome military recruiters during his 2011 State of the Union address, some law professors have questioned why the AALS has issued no statement declaring an end to its recommendations.

<doc id="623762" wikidata="Q8017602" url="?curid=623762" title="William Rivers Pitt">
<text>William Rivers Pitt (November 9, 1971 – September 26, 2022) was an American author, editor, and liberal political activist.

==Background==
William Rivers Pitt was born in Washington, D.C.; his father, Charles Redding Pitt, became chair of the Alabama State Democratic Party. He was educated in English literature the College of the Holy Cross, a Catholic college in Massachusetts. He taught English literature, journalism, grammar, and history at a small private school before joining the staff of the non-profit news organization Truthout.

==Writing career==

Pitt&#x27;s book &quot;War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn&#x27;t Want You to Know&quot;, with Scott Ritter, was published by Profile Books in 2002. It was an in-depth examination of the Bush administration&#x27;s false WMD arguments set against testimony and data from a weapons inspector who oversaw the destruction of Iraq&#x27;s stockpiles in the 1990s. In reviewing this book, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;the most comprehensive independent analysis of the state of knowledge about Iraq&#x27;s weapons programmes until the new team of inspectors went back.&quot; In December of 2002, the book appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list, was an international best-seller, and was translated into 13 languages. 

Pitt&#x27;s book &quot;The Greatest Sedition Is Silence: Four Years in America&quot;,&quot; was published by Pluto Press in 2003. It is an analysis of U.S. politics in areas outside the push for war in Iraq, covering topics such as the Enron collapse, the media and &quot;Fox News&quot;, but primarily concentrates on the aftermath of the attacks of September 11.

Pitt also published &quot;Our Flag, Too: The Paradox of Patriotism&quot; with Context Books in 2003.

Pitt&#x27;s book &quot;House of Ill Repute: Reflections on War, Lies, and America&#x27;s Ravaged Reputation,&quot; was published by PoliPoint Press in 2006. It serves as a second volume to Pitt&#x27;s first book by compiling the myriad ways the Bush administration lied the U.S. into an invasion of Iraq, and documents the steep cost in blood, treasure and reputation brought by the war. 

Pitt&#x27;s book &quot;The Mass Destruction of Iraq: The Disintegration of a Nation: Why It Is Happening, and Who Is Responsible&quot;, was published by Truthout in 2014. The book was co-authored by Truthout reporter Dahr Jamail, who traveled to Iraq after &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; and spent months as an unembedded journalist reporting from Fallujah and other hot spots in the war. Pitt and Jamail combined to create a searing indictment of the war, and of those who championed it in Washington D.C. &quot;Mass Destruction&quot; is the last volume of Pitt&#x27;s trilogy on the war.

==Personal life==
Pitt died on September 26, 2022.

<text>The Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system or Minnesota State, previously branded as MnSCU, comprises 26 state colleges and 7 state universities with 54 campuses throughout Minnesota. The system is the largest higher education system in Minnesota (separate from the University of Minnesota system) and the third largest in the United States, educating more than 300,000 students annually. It is governed by a 15-member board of trustees appointed by the governor, which has broad authority to run the system. The Minnesota State system office is located in the Wells Fargo Place building in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

In 2016, the Board of Trustees approved a rebranding of the system to the shortened &quot;Minnesota State&quot;. This change was met with criticism as this is also the nickname commonly attributed to Minnesota State University, Mankato. The change affected branding but did not alter the legal name of the organization that is identified in state statute. Commonly the system is now being referenced in media as the Minnesota State System, while the institution in Mankato is being referenced as Minnesota State.

== History ==
In 1991, the Minnesota Legislature issued legislation which founded the creation of the Minnesota State system. Through this process the then-existing Minnesota state university system, community college system and technical college system were combined into a single higher education system. This initially was to be accomplished by 1995 but due to statewide opposition it wasn&#x27;t until 1997 that a Central Office was formed and individual institutions began to operate under centralized direction.

The members of the University of Minnesota could not be compelled by the legislature to be part of the new system because it had sued for independence in the form of constitutional autonomy from legislative oversight. This autonomy was affirmed by the Minnesota Supreme Court after the State of Minnesota was formed and was a response to lobbying demands from a newly formed Alumni Association of the University of Minnesota in the early 19th century.
This difference in independence and power has led to significant differences in the way in which the State system operates and educates students. Through this legislation the State system was given the ad-hoc role of educating all students outside of the doctoral research role that the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities campus provides. In addition, individual university and college members have, by comparison, significantly smaller endowments, and receive less funding from the state government of Minnesota than comparable members of the University of Minnesota system. An appropriation by the state of Minnesota was supposed to cover 66% of the cost to educate students, and as of 2014 the state provides about 50%.

==Operations==
Minnesota State offers a wide range of collegiate programs from associates degrees to applied doctorates. All of the system&#x27;s two-year community and technical colleges have an open admissions policy, which means that anyone with either a high school diploma or equivalent degree may enroll. The system also runs an online collaborative called &quot;Minnesota Online&quot;, which is a gateway to the online course offerings of Minnesota State. More than 150 academic programs are available completely or predominantly online. About 93,300 students took online courses during the 2009–2010 academic year.

The economic impact of the Minnesota State system is estimated to be $8 billion per year, with a return of twelve dollars for every dollar invested.

Tuition at Minnesota State is lower than tuition at the University of Minnesota, private universities, or private trade schools. More than 80 percent of graduates stay in Minnesota to work or continue their education. The job-placement rate based on the last available data at two-year colleges is 88.0 percent in 2006, meaning that 88.0 percent of graduates find jobs in their chosen fields.

The Minnesota State has not designated an official flagship institution; however, Minnesota State University, Mankato and Saint Cloud State University have been referred to as the system flagship at various points.

== Enrollment and state policy initiatives ==
Minnesota has been experiencing a net loss of college students to institutions out of state since 2001. Minnesota’s net migration of students has been consistently negative, with a net migration of -7,886 reported for the 2022-23 school year. At postsecondary institutions across the state, a trend of declining enrollment has been present for the past 14 years. This downward trend has been particularly intense within Minnesota State two and four-year colleges and universities between 2018 and 2022. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Minnesota state government took measures to reinvest into higher education. This included a $650 million investment into the Minnesota Office of Higher Education incorporated into the One Minnesota Budget signed into law by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in May 2023. The North Star Promise Scholarship Program was amongst the many inclusions of the Higher Education portion of the One Minnesota Budget. The program covers the cost of tuition and fees for Minnesota resident students with a family adjusted gross income (AGI) of less than $80,000 who attend a public or tribal institution for higher education.

The 2023-24 academic year yielded a long absent positive trend of undergraduate enrollment within Minnesota’s post secondary institutions: a 1.2% increase estimated by the National Student Clearinghouse. The North Star Promise Scholarship Program is set to take effect for the fall 2024 semester across public Minnesota colleges and universities. Once in effect, the Minnesota Office of Higher Education has estimated a positive financial impact, as it relates to higher education, for more than 15,000 students statewide. Other initiatives from the Minnesota Office of Higher Education include Direct Admissions Minnesota. This program works to streamline the admissions process for high school seniors into public Minnesota post secondary institutions for those interested. Nearly all schools part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system participate in the Direct Admissions program.

<text>Gordon Edgar Downie (February 6, 1964 – October 17, 2017) was a Canadian rock singer-songwriter, musician, writer, poet, and activist. He was the singer and lyricist for the Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip, which he fronted from its formation in 1984 until his death in 2017. He is revered by many as an inspiring and influential artist in Canada&#x27;s music history.

Downie released eight solo albums, three posthumously: &quot;Coke Machine Glow&quot; (2001), &quot;Battle of the Nudes&quot; (2003), &quot;The Grand Bounce&quot; (2010), &quot;And the Conquering Sun&quot; (2014), &quot;Secret Path&quot; (2016), &quot;Introduce Yerself&quot; (2017), &quot;Away Is Mine&quot; (2020), and &quot;Lustre Parfait&quot; (2023). His first to hit number one was &quot;Introduce Yerself&quot;, shortly after his death. His family and managers said future releases are planned, including solo material and unreleased work with the Hip.

==Early life==
Gordon Edgar Downie was born in Amherstview, Ontario, and raised in Kingston, Ontario, along with his brothers Mike and Patrick, and sisters Charlyn and Paula. He was the son of Lorna (Neal) and Edgar Charles Downie, a travelling salesman, later a real estate broker and developer. In Kingston, Downie attended the downtown high school Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute, where other members of the Tragically Hip also attended. In high school, Downie was the front man for a band called the Slinks performing at the KCVI Variety show and rivalling older members Rob Baker and Gord Sinclair&#x27;s band the Rodents. After graduating from high school, Downie attended Queen&#x27;s University where he majored in film studies, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1986.

==Career==
===The Tragically Hip===
In 1984, at age 20, Downie formed the Tragically Hip with Rodents members Rob Baker and Gord Sinclair, another younger Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute alumnus, Johnny Fay, and saxophonist Davis Manning. In 1986, Manning left the band as guitarist-vocalist Paul Langlois joined. Originally, the band covered popular British rock songs from the 1960s. In an interview with Canadian music journalist Steve Newton, Downie noted that the Tragically Hip&#x27;s early set list was originally drawn to bands such as The Yardbirds and The Stones, a decision that was made because the Hip wished other Kingston bar bands would also play the genre. The Tragically Hip quickly became famous once MCA Records president Bruce Dickinson saw them performing at Massey Hall in Toronto and offered them a record deal.

Downie became known for his showmanship in live Hip performances, incorporating mid-song spoken-word rants, zany gestures and movements, and especially on their final Man Machine Poem Tour, his bold wardrobe.

Downie began pursuing a solo career with the release of &quot;Coke Machine Glow&quot; in 2001. He published his first poetry and prose collection alongside the album and under the same title.
The backing musicians, credited as the Goddamned Band, consisted of indie rock band the Dinner Is Ruined, Josh Finlayson of Skydiggers and singer-songwriter Julie Doiron.
He released his second solo album, &quot;Battle of the Nudes&quot;, in 2003 before returning to the studio with the Tragically Hip. His third solo effort, &quot;The Grand Bounce&quot;, was released in 2010. Both it and &quot;Battle of the Nudes&quot; are credited as Gord Downie and the Country of Miracles.
===Collaborations===
In addition to his solo works, Downie collaborated with several fellow Canadian and international artists. His most famous Canadian collaborations are with Richard Terfry (better known as Buck 65), Dallas Green of City and Colour and Alexisonfire, the Sadies and Fucked Up. Terfry collaborated with Downie on the song &quot;Whispers of the Waves&quot; off the album &quot;20 Odd Years&quot;. Terfry composed the track and with the help of Charles Austen, his co-writer, decided Downie&#x27;s vocals would be the best fit for their song.
In 2008, Downie appeared as a guest vocalist on City and Colour&#x27;s single &quot;Sleeping Sickness&quot;.
In 2014, Downie released an album with the Sadies called &quot;And the Conquering Sun&quot;. He commented on working with the Sadies, saying, &quot;I enjoy getting together with those guys; it&#x27;s a whole other universe. They&#x27;re writing all the music and I&#x27;m writing all the lyrics and we&#x27;re coming up with some neat stuff. You do it for the company but I&#x27;m genuinely shocked by the themes and things you touch based on the music you&#x27;re singing to. That&#x27;s really compelling to me.&quot; The album consists of ten songs.

Also in 2014 Downie appeared as a guest vocalist on &quot;The Art of Patrons&quot;, a song from Fucked Up&#x27;s album &quot;Glass Boys&quot;.

On February 2, 2017, Downie joined Blue Rodeo onstage at Massey Hall for a performance of Blue Rodeo&#x27;s song &quot;Lost Together&quot;. This marked his last public appearance before his death.

===In other media===
Downie had cameo appearances in &quot;Men with Brooms&quot;, in which the Tragically Hip play a curling team. Downie also made a cameo appearance in the 2008 indie drama &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, directed by Jean-Marc Piché. Downie also appears in the Trailer Park Boys movie &quot;The Big Dirty&quot;, in which he and Alex Lifeson play a pair of police officers. More recently, he and other members of the band appeared in the episode of &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; entitled &quot;Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys&quot;, in which he is harassed while eating a bologna sandwich at a singles dance. Downie was also featured in the sitcom &quot;Corner Gas&quot; in the episode &quot;Rock On!&quot; in which the Tragically Hip are shown as a local band practising in the main character&#x27;s garage. Colin James is also featured in the episode. Downie also appeared in Michael McGowan&#x27;s 2008 film, &quot;One Week&quot;. A documentary film, &quot;Long Time Running&quot;, about the Tragically Hip&#x27;s summer 2016 cross-Canada farewell concert tour, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2017.

==Philanthropic work==
===Environmentalism===
Downie was heavily involved in environmental movements, especially issues concerning water rights. He was a board member of Lake Ontario Waterkeeper. With Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, Downie helped work on a cause to prevent a cement company from burning tires for fuel. He was also a part of the Swim Drink Fish Music club, a project that unites artists and environmentalists in a music club to raise money for Waterkeeper organizations in Canada. Downie served as a Swim Drink Fish &quot;Ambassador, board member, and creative force&quot;.

===The Great Moon Gathering===
In February 2012 in Fort Albany, Ontario, Downie and the Tragically Hip played at the Great Moon Gathering, a yearly educational conference that takes place in various communities along Northern Ontario&#x27;s James Bay coast. Its focus is on youth learning and combining Cree education with the contemporary world. The venue was small and not typical of the band. Author Joseph Boyden, who invited them, said their motivation was to &quot;initiate a guerrilla act of love for a people who are so thoroughly underrepresented but now, somehow, overexposed for only their shortcomings. A guerrilla act of love to show the rest of the country what strength and artistry, grace and humour the Cree possess.&quot; In addition to the Tragically Hip&#x27;s performance, Downie sang a song with a local band, Northern Revolution. The song &quot;Goodnight Attawapiskat&quot; from the album &quot;Now for Plan A&quot; was a result of this trip.

===Indigenous affairs===
On October 13, 2016, Downie and his brother Mike, along with the Wenjack family, announced the founding of the Gord Downie and Chanie Wenjack Fund to support reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. The fund is a part of Downie&#x27;s legacy and commitment to Canada&#x27;s First Peoples. Chanie Wenjack was a young Indigenous boy who died trying to escape a residential school, who became the central character of Downie&#x27;s &quot;Secret Path&quot; project. The Gord Downie and Chanie Wenjack Fund is a registered charity.

At the Assembly of First Nations in Gatineau, Quebec, on December 6, 2016, National Chief Perry Bellegarde honoured Downie with an eagle feather, a symbol of the creator above, for his support of the Indigenous peoples of Canada. Bellegarde also bestowed on Downie an honorary aboriginal name, Wicapi Omani, which is Lakota for &quot;man who walks among the stars&quot;.

Downie took to Parliament Hill on July 2, 2017, to speak out for Canada&#x27;s young Indigenous people, likening it to the same kind of pain young people suffered in the now defunct residential schools.

===Awards and recognitions===
In May 2016, Downie and his bandmates received honorary degrees from Queen&#x27;s University. Downie was not able to attend the ceremony due to his illness which had not yet been made public.

On December 22, 2016, Downie was selected as The Canadian Press&#x27;s Canadian Newsmaker of the Year and was the first entertainer selected for the title. In December 2017, Downie was again named Canadian Newsmaker of the Year for the second year in a row, in recognition of the public reaction to his death.

Downie, along with his Tragically Hip bandmates, was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada on June 19, 2017, for &quot;their contribution to Canadian music and for their support of various social and environmental causes&quot;.

In December 2017, Percy Hatfield, the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) representing Windsor—Tecumseh introduced the bill &quot;Poet Laureate of Ontario Act In Memory of Gord Downie&quot; to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. It was passed in December 2019, establishing the Poet Laureate of Ontario.

== Cancer diagnosis and farewell tour ==
In December 2015, shortly after attending his father&#x27;s funeral, Downie was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour. The Tragically Hip announced his diagnosis on their website on May 24, 2016. Doctors at Toronto&#x27;s Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre confirmed the same day that it was a glioblastoma, which had responded favourably to radiation and chemotherapy treatment but was not curable.

Downie toured with the band in summer 2016 to support &quot;Man Machine Poem&quot;, the band&#x27;s 13th studio album. The tour&#x27;s final concert was held at the Rogers K-Rock Centre in Kingston, Ontario, on August 20 and was broadcast and streamed live by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on television, radio and internet. It was viewed by an estimated 11.7 million people.

The tour was profiled in the 2017 documentary film &quot;Long Time Running&quot;, directed by Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas de Pencier. The final concert was released on DVD under the title &quot;A National Celebration&quot; on December 24, 2017.

==&quot;Secret Path&quot;==
In September 2016, Downie announced he would release a new solo album, &quot;Secret Path&quot; in October. The album was accompanied by a graphic novel on which he collaborated with Jeff Lemire, and an animated television film which aired on CBC Television. He also performed a few live shows to support the album, with supporting musicians Kevin Drew, Charles Spearin, Dave Hamelin, Kevin Hearn and Josh Finlayson.

At the 6th Canadian Screen Awards in 2018, Downie posthumously won two Canadian Screen Awards for the television version of &quot;Secret Path&quot;. The program won the Donald Brittain Award for Best Political or Social Documentary Program and Best Music in a Non-Fiction Program. At the 7th Canadian Screen Awards in 2019, two additional awards were won by &quot;Gord Downie&#x27;s Secret Path in Concert&quot;, the CBC Television broadcast of Downie&#x27;s 2016 Roy Thomson Hall performance of the album.

==&quot;Introduce Yerself&quot;==
In September 2017, Downie announced what would be his final solo double-album titled &quot;Introduce Yerself&quot;; it was released on October 27, 2017, ten days after Downie&#x27;s death.

At the Juno Awards of 2018, the album won the Juno Award for Adult Alternative Album of the Year, Downie and Drew won Songwriter of the Year for &quot;A Natural&quot;, &quot;Introduce Yerself&quot; and &quot;The North&quot;, and Downie won the Artist of the Year. In a tribute to Downie at the Juno Awards ceremony, Sarah Harmer, Dallas Green and Kevin Hearn performed a medley of the album&#x27;s title track with the Tragically Hip song &quot;Bobcaygeon&quot;.

==Personal life==
Downie was married to Laura Leigh Usher, herself a breast cancer survivor. They had four children. Downie and Usher separated in 2015 before Downie&#x27;s cancer diagnosis. They were not divorced at the time of Downie&#x27;s death and had remained close friends. Under the stage name Kaya Usher, she released her own debut album as a singer, &quot;All This Is&quot;, in 2021 with the participation of two of their four children; some of the tracks feature Usher performing with a guitar that had once belonged to Downie.

Downie was the godson of Harry Sinden, a former hockey coach, general manager and president of the Boston Bruins.

== Death and reactions ==
Downie died of glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on October 17, 2017, at the age of 53 in Toronto. The surviving members of the Tragically Hip made the news of his death public the next morning by sharing an official statement from his family on their website:

Upon hearing the news, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a tribute statement on his official website. Later in the day, he held a press conference at Parliament Hill at which he tearfully remembered Downie as &quot;Our buddy Gord, who loved this country with everything he had—and not just loved it in a nebulous, &#x27;Oh, I love Canada&#x27; way. He loved every hidden corner, every story, every aspect of this country that he celebrated his whole life.&quot; Canadian MP Tony Clement called upon the government to consider holding a state funeral for Downie, stating &quot;I think he matters that much to Canadians.&quot; The House of Commons observed a moment of silence.

Downie was widely mourned in Canada. The CBC news broadcast, The National, spent 40 of its sixty-minute broadcast discussing Gord and The Hip. Several prominent Canadians, including actors Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogen; Toronto mayor John Tory; singers k.d. lang and Neil Young; rapper Drake; and the rock group Rush, remembered Downie on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Additionally, several National Hockey League teams and players, as well as the league itself, paid tribute to Downie through social media, owing to the high popularity of the Tragically Hip&#x27;s music among Canadian professional hockey players. The Toronto Maple Leafs honoured Downie with a moment of silence before their game on October 18, during which the retired-jersey banner for Bill Barilko – whom Downie had written about in the Tragically Hip song &quot;Fifty Mission Cap&quot; – was lowered from the rafters of the Air Canada Centre.

Residents of the Ontario village of Bobcaygeon, which Downie had written about in the song of the same name, held a candlelight vigil for him the night after his death; a large public gathering also took place at Springer Market Square in the band&#x27;s hometown of Kingston.

In Kingston, Mayor Bryan Paterson issued a statement, laid a wreath in Springer Market Square near City Hall, and signed a condolence banner. Kingston Transit buses displayed &quot;GORD, WE&#x27;LL MISS YOU&quot; on their electronic destination signs, alternately with the regular route number and name display.

Canadian radio stations responded heavily to Downie&#x27;s death, with early figures indicating the band&#x27;s radio airplay on October 18 increased 1,500 percent compared to a normal day. Most rock radio stations dropped regular programming to shift to an all-Tragically Hip format for the day, and some further announced that they would continue the all-Hip format through the weekend until the morning of 23 October. Several stations, including CHEZ-FM in Ottawa, CFRQ-FM in Halifax, CJRQ-FM in Sudbury, CJQQ-FM in Timmins, CKEZ-FM in New Glasgow and CIKR-FM in the Tragically Hip&#x27;s hometown of Kingston dropped their regular names to temporarily rebrand themselves as &quot;Gord FM&quot;.

Stations in other formats, such as contemporary hit radio, adult contemporary or country music, typically did not suspend their normal playlists, but still added some Tragically Hip songs to the day&#x27;s rotation. &quot;Ahead by a Century&quot; was the single most-played song on Canadian radio on the day Downie&#x27;s death was announced.

CBC Radio preempted some of its regular programming in favour of a Downie tribute special hosted by Rich Terfry; although news of Downie&#x27;s death broke just 20 minutes before airtime, CBC Radio One&#x27;s entertainment magazine show &quot;Q&quot; dropped its planned lineup in favour of a live Downie tribute special.

In the wake of Downie&#x27;s death, CTV rescheduled the planned broadcast premiere of &quot;Long Time Running&quot;, a documentary film by Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas de Pencier about the Man Machine Poem Tour of 2016, from November 12 to October 20. CBC Television broadcast his solo Roy Thomson Hall concert of &quot;Secret Path&quot; on October 22.

Arjun Sahgal, an oncologist with the Sunnybrook Hospital who had been involved in treating Downie after his cancer diagnosis, lauded Downie&#x27;s strength and courage in continuing to tour, make music and use his fame to publicize both cancer awareness and indigenous reconciliation issues, and called Downie &quot;a Terry Fox in the modern day&quot;.

==Posthumous archival releases==
In 2018, two recordings by Downie, &quot;The East Wind&quot; and &quot;At the Quinte Hotel&quot;, were released on the compilation album &quot;The Al Purdy Songbook&quot;. A different recording of &quot;The East Wind&quot; appeared on &quot;The Grand Bounce&quot;, and &quot;At the Quinte Hotel&quot; was previously released in video form, but never in an audio recording.

In June 2020, the Tragically Hip and manager Jake Gold announced that they were undertaking an &quot;archaeological dig&quot; to select music and memorabilia from the band&#x27;s archives for future release.

In August, Downie&#x27;s Twitter account was reactivated, and began posting a series of teaser photographs of handwritten song lyrics, accompanied by numbers that appeared to be a calendar countdown to the date of October 15. On September 21, it was confirmed that &quot;Away Is Mine&quot;, an album comprising the last songs Downie recorded in his lifetime, will be released on October 16. The album is co-written with Josh Finlayson, a frequent collaborator, and is accompanied with an acoustic version of all the produced tracks. Also, a series of music videos for all the songs on the album were created by Canadian artists and released on YouTube.

In October 2022, the song &quot;Lustre Parfait&quot; was released to streaming services as a preview of an album collecting various previously unreleased songs that Downie had recorded with Bob Rock. The album, titled &quot;Lustre Parfait&quot;, was released on May 5th, 2023.

<doc id="623773" wikidata="Q1410563" url="?curid=623773" title="Keeper of the Seals">
<text>The title keeper of the seals or equivalent is used in several contexts, denoting the person entitled to keep and authorize use of the great seal of a given country. The title may or may not be linked to a particular cabinet or ministerial office. This is most often the case today, but in the past the role was often a distinct and important job.

==Canada==

The official Keeper of the Great Seal of Canada is the Governor General. At his or her installation, the governor general swears three oaths, one of which is the oath of the office of keeper of the great seal. The seal is also presented to the Governor General who entrusts it back to the registrar general for safekeeping. The seal is actually kept with the Registrar General of Canada, a title which since 1995 has been linked to the office of Minister of Industry.

Each province since 1869 has its own seal and their keepers are the provincial Lieutenant Governors. As the Registrar General actually keeps the Great seal of Canada, so the provincial Great Seals are placed by the lieutenant-governors of the provinces into the keeping of the provincial Attorneys-General.

==France==

The French Keeper of the Seals (&quot;Garde des Sceaux&quot;) is a title held by the Minister of Justice. Formerly, as Keeper of the Seals of France, this title belonged to the Chancellor, the &quot;ancien régime&quot; counterpart of the minister of justice. The title is nowadays often used interchangeably with &quot;Minister of Justice of France.&quot;

The Minister of Justice guards the Great Seal of France, dating from 1848, in his or her office, as well as the stamping press. The Seal was used in 1958 to seal the Constitution of France and has since been used to seal certain constitutional amendments.

==Italy==
In Italy, the Minister of Justice assumes the duties of Guardasigilli (Keeper of the Seals). As &quot;Guardasigilli&quot;, the Minister of Justice countersigns all laws and decrees signed by the president and the decrees issued by other ministries. The Minister of Justice is also the editor of the &quot;Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana&quot;, the official bulletin of the Italian Republic.

==Japan==

The Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan (内大臣, Naidaijin) was an administrative post not of Cabinet rank in the government of the Empire of Japan, responsible for keeping the Privy Seal of Japan and State Seal of Japan.

== Malaysia ==
==Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, custody of the great seal is held ex-officio by the Minister of Justice.

==New Zealand==
The Governor-General of New Zealand has custody of the Seal of New Zealand. However, responsibility for the seal is delegated to the Clerk of the Executive Council. The seal is affixed to various instruments that require it.

==Papacy==
In medieval and Renaissance times the Papal &quot;Custode del Piombo&quot; (&quot;Keeper of the Lead&quot;) was an important and well-paid office, always held by a friar. The painter Sebastiano del Piombo held it from 1531 until his death in 1546, and the nickname he is known by came from his job-title. He had to take holy orders for the purpose, despite having a wife and two sons. The position was usually awarded for life, and in the Renaissance was often given to artists who worked on papal projects. The important architect Bramante had been appointed in 1513, but died the next year, when Mariano Fetti succeeded. He was already a friar, and a sort of court jester, but also an intimate friend to the Medici Pope Leo X. He held the role under three popes until his death in 1531, when Sebastiano succeeded him.

==United Kingdom==

Several British officials have titles connected to the keeping of seals.

==United States==

The United States Secretary of State is the official keeper of the Great Seal of the United States, and the seal may only be affixed to instruments as provided by law or by authorization of the President. The authority to manage the operation of the device is delegated to an official at the State Department. This official is the Director of the Office of Presidential Appointments, the office that manages the Great Seal at the Department of State. Informally, the director is sometimes referred to as the “Keeper” in the sense that the job has been delegated.

Unlike the Great Seals listed above, the Great Seal of the United States is the primary graphical emblem of the United States and is used equivalently to a coat of arms.

The seals of individual U.S. states are typically the responsibility of the State Secretary of State.

<text>Electric power systems consist of generation plants of different energy sources, transmission networks, and distribution lines. Each of these components can have environmental impacts at multiple stages of their development and use including in their construction, during the generation of electricity, and in their decommissioning and disposal. These impacts can be split into operational impacts (fuel sourcing, global atmospheric and localized pollution) and construction impacts (manufacturing, installation, decommissioning, and disposal). All forms of electricity generation have some form of environmental impact, but coal-fired power is the dirtiest. This page is organized by energy source and includes impacts such as water usage, emissions, local pollution, and wildlife displacement.

== Greenhouse gas emissions ==
==Water usage==

Water usage is one of the main environmental impacts of electricity generation. All thermal power plants (coal, natural gas, nuclear, geothermal, and biomass) use water as a cooling fluid to drive the thermodynamic cycles that allow electricity to be extracted from heat energy. Solar uses water for cleaning equipment, while hydroelectricity has water usage from evaporation from the reservoirs. The amount of water usage is often of great concern for electricity generating systems as populations increase and droughts become a concern. In addition, changes in water resources may impact the reliability of electricity generation.

Discussions of water usage of electricity generation distinguish between water withdrawal and water consumption. According to the United States Geological Survey, &quot;withdrawal&quot; is defined as the amount of water removed from the ground or diverted from a water source for use, while &quot;consumption&quot; refers to the amount of water that is evaporated, transpired, incorporated into products or crops, or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment. Both water withdrawal and consumption are important environmental impacts to evaluate.

General numbers for fresh water usage of different power sources are shown below.

Steam-cycle plants (nuclear, coal, NG, solar thermal) require a great deal of water for cooling, to remove the heat at the steam condensers. The amount of water needed relative to plant output will be reduced with increasing boiler temperatures. Coal- and gas-fired boilers can produce high steam temperatures and so are more efficient, and require less cooling water relative to output. Nuclear boilers are limited in steam temperature by material constraints, and solar thermal is limited by concentration of the energy source.

Thermal cycle plants near the ocean have the option of using seawater. Such a site will not have cooling towers and will be much less limited by environmental concerns of the discharge temperature since dumping heat will have very little effect on water temperatures. This will also not deplete the water available for other uses. Nuclear power in Japan for instance, uses no cooling towers at all because all plants are located on the coast. If dry cooling systems are used, significant water from the water table will not be used. Other, more novel, cooling solutions exist, such as sewage cooling at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.

Hydroelectricity&#x27;s main cause of water usage is both evaporation and seepage into the water table.

While water usage is still a major necessity for the production of electricity, since 2015 the use of water has decreased. In 2015 the total water withdrawals from thermoelectric power plants was just over 60 trillion gallons, but in 2020 it decreased to just under 50 trillion gallons. The water use has gone down because of the increase in the use of renewable energy sources.

80% of the decrease in water use is due to the use of natural gas and the use of renewables instead of just producing energy through coal-fired plants. And the other 20% of the decrease in water use comes from the implementation of closed loop recirculating and hybrid cooling systems rather than once through cooling systems. Once through cooling systems has an excessive amount of water withdrawals, so the water is only used once then released. While the closed loop water is reused several times so the water withdrawals is much lower.

==Fossil fuels==
Most electricity today is generated by burning fossil fuels and producing steam which is then used to drive a steam turbine that, in turn, drives an electrical generator.

More serious are concerns about the emissions that result from fossil fuel burning. Fossil fuels constitute a significant repository of carbon buried deep underground. Burning them results in the conversion of this carbon to carbon dioxide, which is then released into the atmosphere. The estimated emission from the world&#x27;s electrical power industry is 10 billion tonnes yearly. This results in an increase in the Earth&#x27;s levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which enhances the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming.

=== Coal power ===
Depending on the particular fossil fuel and the method of burning, other emissions may be produced as well. Ozone, sulfur dioxide, NO2 and other gases are often released, as well as particulate matter. Sulfur and nitrogen oxides contribute to smog and acid rain. In the past, plant owners addressed this problem by building very tall flue-gas stacks, so that the pollutants would be diluted in the atmosphere. While this helps reduce local contamination, it does not help at all with global issues.

Fossil fuels, particularly coal, also contain dilute radioactive material, and burning them in very large quantities releases this material into the environment, leading to low levels of local and global radioactive contamination, the levels of which are, ironically, higher than a nuclear power station as their radioactive contaminants are controlled and stored.

Coal also contains traces of toxic heavy elements such as mercury, arsenic and others. Mercury vaporized in a power plant&#x27;s boiler may stay suspended in the atmosphere and circulate around the world. While a substantial inventory of mercury exists in the environment, as other man-made emissions of mercury become better controlled, power plant emissions become a significant fraction of the remaining emissions. Power plant emissions of mercury in the United States are thought to be about 50 tons per year in 2003, and several hundred tons per year in China. Power plant designers can fit equipment to power stations to reduce emissions.

Coal mining practices in the United States have also included strip mining and removing mountain tops. Mill tailings are left out bare and have been leached into local rivers and resulted in most or all of the rivers in coal producing areas to run red year round with sulfuric acid that kills all life in the rivers.

=== Fossil gas power ===
In 2022 the IEA said that greenhouse gas emissions from gas-fired power plants had increased by nearly 3% the previous year and that more efforts were needed to reduce them.

As well as greenhouse gases, these power plants emit nitrogen oxides (NOx) but this is less dangerous than NOx from gas appliances in houses.

The efficiency of gas-fired power plants can be improved by co-generation and geothermal (combined heat and power) methods. Process steam can be extracted from steam turbines. Waste heat produced by thermal generating stations can be used for space heating of nearby buildings. By combining electric power production and heating, less fuel is consumed, thereby reducing the environmental effects compared with separate heat and power systems.

=== Fuel oil and diesel ===
Dirty oil is burnt in power plants in a few oil producing countries such as Iran. Diesel is often used in backup generators, which can cause air pollution.

==Switching from fuels to electricity==
==Nuclear power==

==Renewable energy==
Renewable power technologies can have significant environmental benefits. Unlike coal and natural gas, they can generate electricity and fuels without releasing significant quantities of and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, however the greenhouse gas savings from a number of biofuels have been found to be much less than originally anticipated, as discussed in the article Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels.

Both solar and wind have been criticized from an aesthetic point of view. However, methods and opportunities exist to deploy these renewable technologies efficiently and unobtrusively: fixed solar collectors can double as noise barriers along highways, and extensive roadway, parking lot, and roof-top area is currently available; amorphous photovoltaic cells can also be used to tint windows and produce energy.

=== Hydroelectricity ===
The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store potential power for later electrical production. The combination of a natural supply of energy and production on demand has made hydro power the largest source of renewable energy by far. Other advantages include longer life than fuel-fired generation, low operating costs, and the provision of facilities for water sports. Some dams also operate as pumped-storage plants balancing supply and demand in the generation system. Overall, hydroelectric power can be less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels or nuclear energy, and areas with abundant hydroelectric power attract industry.

However, in addition to the advantages above, there are several disadvantages to dams that create large reservoirs. These may include: dislocation of people living where the reservoirs are planned, release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide at construction and flooding of the reservoir, disruption of aquatic ecosystems and bird life, adverse impacts on the river environment, and in rare cases catastrophic failure of the dam wall.

Some other disadvantages of the construction of hydroelectric dams is having to build access roads to get to the dam which disrupt the land ecosystem and not just the water ecosystems. Also with the increase in carbon dioxide, there is an increase in methane. This is from the flooding during the creation of the dams, when plants are submerged underwater and decay, they release methane gas. Another disadvantage is the upfront cost to build the dam and the amount of time it takes to build it.

Some dams only generate power and serve no other purpose, but in many places large reservoirs are needed for flood control and/or irrigation, adding a hydroelectric portion is a common way to pay for a new reservoir. Flood control protects life/property and irrigation supports increased agriculture.

Small hydro and run-of-the-river are two low impact alternatives to hydroelectric reservoirs, although they may produce intermittent power due to a lack of stored water.

===Biomass===
Electrical power can be generated by burning anything which will combust. Some electrical power is generated by burning crops which are grown specifically for the purpose. Usually this is done by fermenting plant matter to produce ethanol, which is then burned. This may also be done by allowing organic matter to decay, producing biogas, which is then burned. Also, when burned, wood is a form of biomass fuel.

Burning biomass produces many of the same emissions as burning fossil fuels. However, growing biomass captures carbon dioxide out of the air, so that the net contribution to global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is small.

The process of growing biomass is subject to the same environmental concerns as any kind of agriculture. It uses a large amount of land, and fertilizers and pesticides may be necessary for cost-effective growth. Biomass that is produced as a by-product of agriculture shows some promise, but most such biomass is currently being used, for plowing back into the soil as fertilizer if nothing else.

===Wind power===
===Geothermal power===
Geothermal energy is the heat of the Earth, which can be tapped into to produce electricity in power plants. Warm water produced from geothermal sources can be used for industry, agriculture, bathing and cleansing. Where underground steam sources can be tapped, the steam is used to run a steam turbine. Geothermal steam sources have a finite life as underground water is depleted. Arrangements that circulate surface water through rock formations to produce hot water or steam are, on a human-relevant time scale, renewable.

While a geothermal power plant does not burn any fuel, it will still have emissions due to substances other than steam which come up from the geothermal wells. These may include hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide. Some geothermal steam sources entrain non-soluble minerals that must be removed from the steam before it is used for generation; this material must be properly disposed. Any (closed cycle) steam power plant requires cooling water for condensers; diversion of cooling water from natural sources, and its increased temperature when returned to streams or lakes, may have a significant impact on local ecosystems.

Removal of ground water and accelerated cooling of rock formations can cause earth tremors. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) fracture underground rock to produce more steam; such projects can cause earthquakes. Certain geothermal projects (such as one near Basel, Switzerland in 2006) have been suspended or canceled owing to objectionable seismicity induced by geothermal recovery. However, risks associated with &quot;hydrofracturing induced seismicity are low compared to that of natural earthquakes, and can be reduced by careful management and monitoring&quot; and &quot;should not be regarded as an impediment to further development of the Hot Rock geothermal energy resource&quot;.

<text>The Isthmus of Corinth (Greek: Ισθμός της Κορίνθου) is the narrow land bridge which connects the Peloponnese peninsula with the rest of the mainland of Greece, near the city of Corinth. The Isthmus was known in the ancient world as the landmark separating the Peloponnese from mainland Greece. In the first century AD the geographer Strabo noted a stele on the Isthmus of Corinth, which bore two inscriptions. One towards the East, i.e. towards Megara, reading: &quot;Here is not Peloponnesus, but Ionia&quot; () and the one towards the West, i.e. towards the Peloponnese: &quot;Here is Peloponnesus, not Ionia&quot; (); Plutarch ascribed the erection of the stele to the Attic hero Theseus, on his way to Athens.

To the west of the Isthmus is the Gulf of Corinth, and to the east the Saronic Gulf. Since 1893 the Corinth Canal has run through the wide isthmus, effectively making the Peloponnese an island. Today, two road bridges, two railway bridges and two submersible bridges at both ends of the canal connect the mainland side of the isthmus with the Peloponnese side. Also a military emergency bridge is located at the west end of the canal.

==History of the canal==

The idea for a shortcut to save boats from having to sail all the way around the Peloponnese was long considered by the Ancient Greeks. The first attempt to build a canal there was carried out by the tyrant Periander in the 7th century BC. He abandoned the project owing to technical difficulties, and instead constructed a simpler and less costly overland stone ramp, named Diolkos, as a portage road. Remnants of Diolkos still exist today next to the modern canal.
When the Romans took control of Greece, a number of different solutions were tried. Julius Caesar foresaw the advantages of a link for his newly built Colonia Laus Iulia Corinthiensis. By the reign of Tiberius, engineers tried to dig a canal, but were defeated by lack of modern equipment. Instead they built an Ancient Egyptian device: boats were rolled across the isthmus on logs, as the Egyptians had rolled blocks of granite to make their pyramids. This was in use by AD 32. In AD 67, the philhellene Roman emperor Nero ordered 6,000 slaves to dig a canal with spades. Historian Flavius Josephus writes that the 6,000 slaves were Jewish pirates, taken captive by Vespasian during the Jewish wars. According to Pliny the Elder, the work advanced four stadia (about 0.8 km or  mile). The following year Nero died, and his successor Galba abandoned the project as being too expensive.

In the modern era, the idea was first seriously proposed in 1830, soon after Greece&#x27;s independence from the Ottoman Empire, and was brought to completion in 1893 after eleven years&#x27; work.

===Preservation efforts===
Near the canal runs an ancient stone trackway, the Diolkos, once used for dragging ships overland. There are major concerns about preservation of this path. Greek campaigners are calling for greater effort by the Greek government to protect this archaeological site.

==Hexamilion wall==
The Hexamilion wall is a Roman defensive wall constructed across the Isthmus of Corinth guarding the only land route into the Peloponnese peninsula from mainland Greece. It is located close to the Corinth Canal, and is the largest single archaeological structure in Greece.

<text>Bainbridge Colby (December 22, 1869 – April 11, 1950) was an American politician and attorney who was a co-founder of the United States Progressive Party and Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s last Secretary of State. Colby was a Republican until he helped co-found the National Progressive Party in 1912; he ran for multiple offices as a member of that party, but never won.

Colby served as Secretary of State from February 1920 until 1921, at a time when President Woodrow Wilson was medically handicapped and largely out of touch. He is best known for promoting a Good Neighbor policy for Latin America, and for denouncing the communist regime in Russia.

==Early life and education==
Bainbridge Colby was born in St. Louis, Missouri on December 22, 1869. He graduated from Williams College, where he was admitted to Phi Beta Kappa, then attended Columbia Law School and New York Law School (1892).

==Career==
He was admitted to the New York bar, and served as a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 29th D.) 1901–1902. 
He spoke at the Colby College commencement on June 19, 1933, at which time he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

===Politics===
At the 1914 New York state election, Colby ran on the Progressive ticket for U.S. Senator from New York, but was defeated by Republican James W. Wadsworth, Jr. At the 1916 New York state election, he ran again, this time on the Progressive and Independence League tickets, but was defeated by Republican William M. Calder.

During World War I, Colby was a member of the United States Shipping Board.

Colby was a special assistant to the United States Attorney General in an anti-trust action in 1917, and represented the U.S. at the Inter-Allied Conference at Paris the same year.

===Secretary of State===
Wilson appointed him Secretary of State on March 23, 1920, after firing his predecessor, Robert Lansing, for insubordination. Wilson&#x27;s appointment of Colby was &quot;bizarre&quot; says historian John Milton Cooper, for Colby had no diplomatic experience or skills. Editorial responses from leading newspapers ranged &quot;from puzzlement to outrage.&quot; Colby was chosen because he was totally loyal to Wilson.

On August 26, eight days after ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, Colby issued the official proclamation that it had become a part of the Constitution of the United States, guaranteeing women the right to vote. In December 1920, Colby embarked on the battleship for an official goodwill cruise to South America. His goodwill trip set the stage for the transition to a &quot;Good Neighbor&quot; policy.

Colby advocated his policies firmly even as Wilson suffered the debilitating side effects of a series of strokes. Colby supported the League of Nations and established a precedent for not recognizing newly Communist Russia; that would be reversed in 1933. In a major statement in 1920, Colby declared:
:It is not possible for the Government of the United States to recognize the present rulers of Russia as a government with which the relations common to friendly governments can be maintained. This conviction has nothing to do with any particular political or social structure which the Russian people themselves may see fit to embrace. It rests upon a wholly different set of facts...that the existing regime in Russia is based upon the negation of every principle of honor and good faith, and every usage and convention, underlying the whole structure of international law; the negation, in short, of every principle upon which it is possible to base harmonious and trustful relations, whether of nations or of individuals. The responsible leaders of the regime have frequently and openly boasted that they are willing to sign agreements and undertakings with foreign Powers while not having the slightest intention of observing such undertakings or carrying out such agreements...it is their understanding that the very existence of Bolshevism in Russia, the maintenance of their own rule, depends, and must continue to depend, upon the occurrence of revolutions in all other great civilized nations, including the United States, which will overthrow and destroy their governments and set up Bolshevist rule in their stead. They have made it quite plain that they intend to use every means, including, of course, diplomatic agencies, to promote such revolutionary movements in other countries.

He served until Wilson left office on March 4, 1921.

The Library of Congress maintains a collection of Colby’s documents.

===Later career===

After leaving office as secretary of state, Colby continued to practice law for the remainder of his career. As an attorney, Colby accepted Woodrow Wilson as a partner after the latter&#x27;s presidency; Colby left that firm in 1923. Earlier in his career, Colby&#x27;s most notable client was Mark Twain. Colby addressed the fractious 1924 Democratic National Convention as the chief spokesman for the minority of delegates that unsuccessfully sought a platform plank denouncing the then-powerful Ku Klux Klan by name.

Colby was a prominent member of the American Liberty League, a group of wealthy, anti-New Deal Democrats. He eventually supported the Republican candidate, Alf Landon, over Franklin Roosevelt in 1936.

==Personal life==
Colby was married twice. His first wife was Nathalie Sedgwick, who became a novelist; they were married in 1895 and had three children (Katherine Sedgwick Colby, Nathalie Sedgwick Colby and Frances Bainbridge Colby). Colby decided to divorce his wife while he was in Paris in 1928. The divorce was finalized in Reno, Nevada later that year. The marriage apparently was very contentious and Colby felt the need to include in his divorce decree a monthly payment of $1,500.00 to stop Nathalie from &quot;ridiculing him in her writings&quot;. Less than a year later, he married Anne Ahlstrand Ely, who was politically engaged in many of the same issues as Colby, such as women&#x27;s suffrage. (As Secretary of State, Colby would issue the proclamation announcing that the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, had been ratified as part of the U.S. Constitution.)

When Colby died in 1950, his widow donated much memorabilia to the local library; it eventually found a home at the Library of Congress. She never remarried and died in 1963. At the time of his death, Colby was the last surviving member of the Wilson Cabinet.

<doc id="623782" wikidata="Q1166230" url="?curid=623782" title="Dark Skies">
<text>Dark Skies is an American UFO conspiracy theory–based science fiction television series. It debuted on NBC on September 21, 1996, and ended on May 31, 1997, and was later rerun by the Sci-Fi Channel; 18 episodes and a two-hour pilot episode were broadcast as a part of NBC&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Thrillogy&quot; block. The success of &quot;The X-Files&quot; on Fox resulted in NBC commissioning this proposed competitor following a pitch from producers Bryce Zabel and Brent Friedman. The series tagline was &quot;History as we know it is a lie.&quot;

==Series overview==
The series presents the idea that 20th-century history as people know it is a lie. It depicts aliens having been among humans since the late 1940s, with a government cover-up concealing their existence from the public. As the series progresses, viewers follow John Loengard and Kim Sayers through the 1960s as they attempt to foil the plots of the alien &quot;Hive&quot;. The Hive is an alien race that planned to invade Earth through a manipulation of historical events and famous figures, including most notably the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In addition, the pair must stay one step ahead of Majestic 12, a covert government agency that has mixed motives. The show depicted a number of real-life 1960s personalities in the plot, such as The Beatles, Robert F. Kennedy, Jim Morrison, and J. Edgar Hoover.

The series was cancelled before the end of the first season, due to low ratings. Although the last episode produced provides some form of closure for the series, with John Loengard meeting his son and the head of Majestic 12 being apparently assassinated, the show&#x27;s creators had originally hoped to create five seasons, as indicated by the show&#x27;s Bible. According to Zabel and Friedman&#x27;s original plan, the pilot and first season (given the overall title &quot;Official Denial&quot;) would cover the period from 1961 to 1969, the second season (&quot;Progenitor&quot;) 1970 to 1976, the third season (&quot;Cloak of Fear&quot;) 1977 to 1986, the fourth season (&quot;New World Order&quot;) would cover 1987 to 1999, and the fifth and final season (&quot;Stroke of Midnight&quot;) would break from the decade-spanning format to encompass the apocalyptic final conflict against the invaders, taking place from 2000 to 2001.

===The Hive===
The series depicts the Hive as an alien species who are covertly invading Earth. They are a parasitic race of small multilegged, spider-like beings that can take control of host bodies, by attaching themselves to the brain. They do this by entering through orifices on the head, commonly the mouth, though they are also shown to enter by squeezing through the nose and ears, with great discomfort to the host. Due to the way they attach themselves to the brain&#x27;s ganglion regions, the series&#x27; protagonists dub the creatures &quot;Ganglions&quot;.

Various stages from Alpha to Delta occur that show varying degrees of the infection. Initial symptoms of take-over include drastic mood swings, behavioral abnormalities, and nervous breakdowns, as the parasite adjusts to taking control of the person&#x27;s mind. Past medical records of a nervous breakdown are a tell-tale sign that someone may have been taken over. The Gamma and Delta stages are where the Hive organism takes total control over the host, which becomes nothing more than a shell for the invading organism.

Not all humans make acceptable hosts for the Ganglions. Due to certain genetic factors, a few humans are incompatible with the Ganglions&#x27; biology; these have been dubbed &quot;Throwbacks&quot;. Several cases occur where a group of people were abducted and taken over by Ganglion parasites, but a Throwback in the group was not infected and simply returned, often because killing them would be too conspicuous. Captured Ganglion parasites have been injected with the blood of Throwbacks, causing them to die in agony. The Hive is running various experiments to try to either eliminate Throwbacks or develop more humans who are easier to control, such as growing cloned human babies in cows.

Some time ago, the Ganglions invaded an advanced alien race, dubbed the &quot;Greys&quot;—the typical depiction of a Roswell Grey alien. The Greys were a race not unlike humans, though they possessed technology making them capable of interstellar travel. The Ganglion parasites invaded them in much the same way that they are trying to invade Earth now, and by the time they realized what was happening, it was too late. Thus, the &quot;Grey aliens&quot; seen abducting humans are really just as much a slave race or &quot;shells&quot; for the Ganglions as the infected humans are.

The Hive&#x27;s language, Thhtmaa, was developed by University of California, Los Angeles, graduate student Matt Pearson. Pearson went on to become a professor of linguistics at Reed College.

When the Ganglions were evolving, apparently before they took over other animals as hosts, they had a natural predator — slug-like creatures called &quot;buzz worms&quot;. They have actually brought samples of the buzz worms along with them with their ships, using them as a particularly gruesome means of executing their own kind.

==Episodes==
Note: The episode &quot;Inhuman Nature&quot; was shown out of chronological order and should come after &quot;Ancient Future&quot;. The episode &quot;White Rabbit&quot; opens up with the Gulf of Tonkin incident on August 2, 1964 but it is a few weeks later after John visits his family and testifies to the Warren Commission when the rest of the episode takes place.

==Home media==
Following fan campaigns for many years, an announcement was made that &quot;Dark Skies&quot; would receive a complete series DVD box set release in October 2007 (presumably for Region 1). However, Sony Entertainment subsequently canceled the release, citing prohibitive music licensing costs.

Executive producers Bryce Zabel and Brent Friedman received permission from Sony to find a DVD releasing partner to put the series on the market. However, three independent DVD firms, while initially extremely enthusiastic about doing so, also backed away after discovering the potential costs involved in licensing the period music. Zabel told fans on his blog:

It doesn&#x27;t mean the idea is dead but it does mean it&#x27;s not going to be easy. I&#x27;m as committed as I&#x27;ve ever been to seeing the series released on DVD so that old fans and new fans can have an excellent quality viewing experience, the way we always intended. Or maybe the conspiracy we wrote about is real and they just don&#x27;t want the truth to get out...

On January 11, 2009, Zabel reported that &quot;Brent and I aren&#x27;t ready to say that&#x27;s the end of it, but it&#x27;s the end of the beginning. We&#x27;re probably more disappointed than any fan out there.&quot;

Region 2 distribution rights were acquired by Mediumrare, with the full series being released on DVD in the United Kingdom on October 18, 2010.

On the August 9, 2010, episode of &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, Zabel announced that the series would be released on Region 1 DVD by Shout! Factory on January 20, 2011. The series was successfully released in the US on six DVDs, including a number of special features (an hour-long &quot;making of&quot; documentary, and the never-before-seen pitch for the second season, among others) on the last disc.

The pilot episode was included in the last DVD as an extra.

==CD soundtrack==
To celebrate the show&#x27;s tenth anniversary, a limited edition CD soundtrack was released on Perseverance Records in September 2006, featuring selections from the original television score composed by Michael Hoenig and a previously unreleased &quot;Pilot Suite&quot; arranged by &quot;The X-Files&quot; composer Mark Snow.

<doc id="623789" wikidata="Q7246313" url="?curid=623789" title="Privilege of peerage">
<text>The privilege of peerage is the body of special privileges belonging to members of the British peerage. It is distinct from parliamentary privilege, which applies only to those peers serving in the House of Lords and the members of the House of Commons, while Parliament is in session and forty days before and after a parliamentary session.

The modern-day peerage is descended from the peerage of England created after the Norman conquest, the peerage of Scotland, and the peerage of Ireland. In each of these lands the peerage was originally a group of trusted advisors and favourites to the king, and depending on the country they were given several privileges that commoners did not have. Prime among them was the right and duty to advise the king on the exercise of his duties, but also included such ancillary features as receiving upgraded protections on defamation and even being hanged with a silk rope. As the peerages were merged under union acts in 1707 and 1800, the complexity of their privileges were merged and streamlined as needed.

These privileges have been lost and eroded over time. Only three privileges of peers as a class survived into the 20th century: the right to be tried by other peers of the realm instead of juries of commoners in cases of treason and felony, freedom from arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, and access to the Sovereign to advise him or her on matters of state. The right to be tried by other peers in the House of Lordswhich could not be waived, had long been considered a disadvantage rather than an advantage, and in practice entailed the House mimicking the advice of judgeswas abolished at the request of the Lords in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, if at all. The remaining privilege is not exercised, runs contrary to the principles of responsible government, and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked. The automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords was abolished in 1999, but life peers are unaffected. Some privileges have been granted to individual lords, but they too had been abolished by the end of the 20th century.

Peers also have several other rights not formally part of the privilege of peerage. For example, they are entitled to use coronets and supporters on their achievements of arms.

== Extent ==

The privilege of peerage extends to all temporal peers and peeresses regardless of their position in relation to the House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the privilege of peerage. Since 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. The privilege of peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress &quot;suo jure&quot; does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. The Lords Spiritual (the 26 archbishops and bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the privilege of peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.

== Access to the Sovereign ==

The Sovereign is traditionally advised by various counsellors, including the peers of the realm. After the Norman conquest of England, peers were summoned to form the &quot;magnum concilium&quot;, or Great Council, which was one of the four councils belonging to the Sovereign. The other three were the Privy Council, Parliament (which was called the &quot;commune concilium&quot;, or Common Council), and judges (who are considered counsellors of the Sovereign on legal matters).

A council composed only of peers was often summoned by early English kings. Such a council, having been in disuse for centuries, was revived in 1640, when Charles I summoned all of the peers of the realm using writs issued under the Great Seal. Though such a council has not been summoned since then and was considered obsolete at the time, each peer is commonly considered a counsellor of the Sovereign, and, according to Sir William Blackstone in 1765, &quot;it is usually looked upon to be the right of each particular peer of the realm, to demand an audience of the King, and to lay before him, with decency and respect, such matters as he shall judge of importance to the public weal.&quot;

The privilege of access is no longer exercised, but it is possibly still retained by peers whether members of the House of Lords or not. In 1999, the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege recommended the formal abolition of any remaining privilege of peerage.

== &quot;Scandalum magnatum&quot; ==
At one time, the honour of peers was especially protected by the law; while defamation of a commoner was known as libel or slander, the defamation of a peer (or of a Great Officer of State) was called &quot;scandalum magnatum&quot;. 
Eighteenth-century jurist Sir William Blackstone opined:


The Statute of Westminster of 1275 provided that &quot;from henceforth none be so hardy to tell or publish any false News or Tales, whereby discord, or occasion of discord or slander may grow between the King and his People, or the Great Men of the Realm.&quot; was punishable under the aforesaid statute as well as under further laws passed during the reign of Richard II. was both a tort and a criminal offence. The prohibition on was first enforced by the King&#x27;s Council. During the reign of Henry VII, the Star Chamber, a court formerly reserved for trial of serious offences such as rioting, assumed jurisdiction over cases, as well as libel and slander. The court, which sat without a jury and in secret, was often used as a political weapon and a device of royal tyranny, leading to its abolition in 1641; its functions in respect of defamation cases passed to the common law courts. However, the number of cases had already dwindled as the laws of libel, slander and contempt of court developed in its place. In the reign of Charles II, came briefly back into fashion; it was used by the future James II against Titus Oates, by Lord Gerard against his cousin Alexander Fitton, and by the Duke of Beaufort against John Arnold. By the end of the 18th century, however, was obsolete. This specific category of the offence of defamation was finally repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1887.

== Trial by peers ==
Just as commoners have a right to trial by a jury of their equals (other commoners), peers and peeresses formerly had a right to trial by other peers. The right of peers to trial by their own order was formalized during the 14th century. A statute, the (15 Edw. 3 Stat. 1. c. 2) passed in 1341 provided:

The privilege of trial by peers was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which included King Henry VI of England, Henry Beaufort and John Kemp) found Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, guilty of witchcraft and banished her to the Isle of Man, a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial by peers.

By the reign of Henry VII of England, there were two methods of trial by peers of the realm: trial in the House of Lords (or, in proper terms, by the High Court of Parliament) and trial in the Court of the Lord High Steward. The House of Lords tried the case if Parliament was in session; otherwise, trial was by the Lord High Steward&#x27;s Court.

In the Lord High Steward&#x27;s Court, a group of Lords Triers, sitting under the chairmanship of the Lord High Steward, acted as judge and jury. By custom, the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a majority was a minimum of 12, but in fact, the number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch&#x27;s position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords.

In the House of Lords, the Lord High Steward was the President or Chairman of the Court, and the entire House determined both questions of fact and questions of law as well as the verdict. By convention, Bishops and Archbishops did not vote on the verdict, though they were expected to attend during the course of the trial. They sat until the conclusion of the deliberations, and withdrew from the chamber just prior to the final vote. At the end of the trial, peers voted on the question before them by standing and declaring their verdict by saying &quot;guilty, upon my honour&quot; or &quot;not guilty, upon my honour&quot;, starting with the most junior baron and proceeding in order of precedence ending with the Lord High Steward. For a guilty verdict, a majority of twelve was necessary. The entire House also determined the punishment to be imposed, which had to accord with the law. For capital crimes the punishment was death; the last peer to be executed was Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, who was hanged for murder in 1760.

From 1547, if a peer or peeress was convicted of a crime, except treason or murder, he or she could claim &quot;privilege of peerage&quot; to escape punishment if it was his or her first offence. In all, the privilege was exercised five times, until it was formally abolished in 1841 when James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan, announced he would claim the privilege and avoid punishment if he was convicted of duelling. He was acquitted before the introduction of the bill.

A trial by the Lordswhich a peer could not waivewas far more a burden than a privilege; unlike commoners, peers had no right to challenge the composition of the jury or to appeal any decision, and there was no leniency granted to those convicted in such a trial compared to commoners convicted of such offences. This was furthered by the fact that the Lords relied almost exclusively on the advice of royal counsel to make any decisions of fact or law. By the late 1930s, supporters of retaining the privilege were a minority in the Lords comprising mainly the holders of older peerages considering it a privilege of the House as a whole, whereas the majority favouring its abolition were holders of newly-granted peerages resenting the difficulties such a trial gave to individual accused peers.

The last trial in the House of Lords was that of Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford, in 1935 for manslaughter (he was acquitted); the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial by peers but the Commons ignored it. The right to trial by peers was abolished when the Lords added an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act 1948, which the Commons accepted. Now peers are tried by juries composed of commoners, though peers were themselves excused from jury service until the House of Lords Act 1999 restricted this privilege to members of the House of Lords. The right to be excused was abolished on 5 April 2004 by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

Peers were and still are, hypothetically, subject to impeachment. Impeachment was a procedure distinct from the aforementioned procedure of trial in the House of Lords, though the House of Lords is the court in both cases. Charges were brought by the House of Commons, not a grand jury. Additionally, while in normal cases the House of Lords tried peers only for felonies or treason, in impeachments the charges could include felonies, treason and misdemeanours. The case directly came before the House of Lords, rather than being referred to it by a writ of certiorari. The Lord High Steward presided only if a peer was charged with high treason; otherwise, the Lord Chancellor presided. Other procedures in trials of impeachment were similar, however, to trials before the House of Lords: at the conclusion of the trial, the spiritual peers withdrew, and the temporal Lords gave their votes on their honour. The last impeachment was that of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, in 1806 for misappropriating public money (he was acquitted). Since then, impeachment has become an obsolete procedure in the United Kingdom.

The novel &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot; (1926) by Dorothy L. Sayers depicts the fictional trial in the House of Lords of a duke who is accused of murder. Sayers researched and used the then-current trial procedures. The comedy film &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949) from Ealing Studios features an almost identical scene.

== Freedom from arrest ==

The privilege of freedom from arrest applies to members of both Houses of Parliament, because of the principle that they must, whenever possible, be available to give advice to the Sovereign. Several other nations have copied this provision; the Constitution of the United States, for example, provides, &quot;The Senators and Representatives ... shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses.&quot; Theoretically, even when Parliament is not sitting, peers enjoy the privilege because they continue to serve the Sovereign as counsellors. However, peers are free from arrest in civil cases only; arrests in criminal matters are not covered by the privilege. Until 1770, a peer&#x27;s domestic servants were also covered by the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil matters.

Most often the privilege was applied in cases of imprisonment in debtors&#x27; prisons. In 1870, both imprisonment for debt and the privilege in relation to freedom from arrest for bankruptcy were abolished, and as a result, the freedom became extremely limited in practical application. Now, civil proceedings involve arrests only when an individual disobeys a court order. Since 1945, the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil cases has arisen in only two cases: &quot;Stourton v Stourton&quot; (1963) and &quot;Peden International Transport, Moss Bros, The Rowe Veterinary Group and Barclays Bank plc v Lord Mancroft&quot; (1989). In the latter most recent case, the trial judge considered the privilege obsolete and inapplicable, and said in proceedings, &quot;the privilege did not apply—indeed ... it is unthinkable in modern times that, in circumstances such as they are in this case, it should&quot;.

== Privilege myths ==

Fanciful tales of peers with whimsical privileges circulate, such as that of the right to wear a hat in the presence of the Sovereign (actually a right of Spanish grandees). The most persistent example of such a legend is that of the Kingsale hat. According to the fable, John de Courcy, Earl of Ulster, obtained from King John the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. Though the tale is untrue—de Courcy was never made an earl and did not receive such a privilege—several authorities on the peerage have seen fit to repeat it. A 19th-century edition of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; suggests the origins of the privilege:

To reward his singular performance, King John supposedly granted de Courcy the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. The 1823 edition of &quot;Debrett&#x27;s Peerage&quot; gives an entirely fictitious account of how Almericus de Courcy, 23rd Baron Kingsale, asserted the privilege:

Despite such inaccuracies, the tale has been frequently repeated. Individual privileges that did exist have fallen into disuse—for example the Lord of the Manor of Worksop (which is not a peerage) was extended to the privilege and duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937, but the right was not exercised at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 as the manor was under corporate ownership at the time.

<text>Jem and The Holograms, also known as simply Jem, is an American animated musical television series that ran from 1985 to 1988. The series is about record company owner Jerrica Benton, her singer alter-ego Jem, and the adventures of her band Jem and The Holograms. The series was a joint collaboration by Hasbro, Sunbow Productions and Marvel Productions, the same team responsible for &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; and &quot;Transformers&quot;. The creator of the series, Christy Marx, had also been a staff writer for the aforementioned programs. The animation for most of the episodes was provided by Japanese animation studio Toei Animation. Eleven episodes and the opening sequence were instead provided by the South Korean studio AKOM.

==Premise==

=== Characters ===
The series revolves around Jerrica Benton, the owner and manager of Starlight Music, and her alter-ego Jem, lead singer of the rock group Jem and The Holograms. Jerrica adopts the persona of Jem with the help of a holographic computer, known as Synergy, which was built by Jerrica&#x27;s father and is bequeathed to her after his death. Jem and The Holograms consists of Kimber Benton, Jerrica&#x27;s younger sister, keyboardist, and main songwriter for the band; Aja Leith, Asian-American guitarist; Shana Elmsford, African-American, who plays the synth drums. Carmen &quot;Raya&quot; Alonso becomes the band&#x27;s synth drummer after Shana briefly leaves the group to pursue a career in fashion. Upon her return to Jem and The Holograms, Shana becomes the band&#x27;s bassist. Jem and The Holograms have two rival bands: The Misfits and The Stingers:

* The Misfits (no relation to the real-world band Misfits) consist of petulant rich girl Pizzazz and her group: no-nonsense guitarist Roxy and kind-hearted, sensitive keytar player Stormer. In the second season, they are joined by the manipulative British saxophonist Jetta.
* The Stingers debut in the third season when they cause disruptions for both groups by becoming co-owners of Stinger Sound with Eric Raymond. Originally from Germany, The Stingers are composed of egotistical lead singer Riot, guitarist/con artist Rapture, and keyboardist Minx.

=== Plot ===
Episodes of the series frequently revolve around Jerrica&#x27;s efforts to keep her two identities separate, protect Synergy from those who might exploit the holographic technology, and support the twelve foster children known as the Starlight Girls who live with her and Jem and The Holograms. The Misfits frequently attempt to upstage Jem and the Holograms&#x27; endeavors, often nearly resulting in physical harm to members of the group. This rivalry is encouraged and manipulated by their manager and central villain in the series, Eric Raymond, the former half-owner of Starlight Music who runs Misfits Music (later Stinger Sound) while working under Pizzazz&#x27;s father, Harvey Gabor. During the series, Eric Raymond constantly plots to become owner of Starlight Music and get revenge on Jem and The Holograms for having cost him control of the company. Jerrica also deals with a complex and emotionally draining faux-love triangle involving her alter identity, Jem, and Rio Pacheco, Jerrica&#x27;s longtime boyfriend. Rio romantically pursues both women, not knowing they are one and the same. Later in the series, Jem is also romantically sought after by Riot, who becomes infatuated with her – adding further complications to her relationships.

=== Music videos and songs ===

The series&#x27; format included three songs for the featured music videos in each episode. The theme song &quot;Truly Outrageous&quot; was the opening and closing theme for the show until late 1987, when &quot;JEM GIRLS&quot; became the series&#x27; opening theme for the majority of episodes and &quot;Truly Outrageous&quot; was kept as the show&#x27;s permanent closing theme. Music videos featured an &quot;in-your-face&quot; style that was directed at the viewer or the more traditional style. The music videos paralleled the style of rock videos found on MTV at the time featuring fast editing, a quick pace, and special effects.

==Episodes==

==Production==

===Conception and staffing===
Hasbro and an outside investor started developing &quot;Jem&quot; in response to an interest that children were showing in music videos. Hasbro hired advertising agency Griffin-Bacal Advertising, the founders of Sunbow Productions, to create the 65-episode animation series. Griffin-Bacal (Sunbow), as well as Marvel Productions, had previously created the successful &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; series for Hasbro. &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; writer Christy Marx was hired to create the series based on the line of dolls and the original concept, which consisted of the two girl bands, Synergy, the boyfriend Rio, and the Rockin&#x27; Roadster. Marx created the full character biographies and relationships, including the love triangle aspect between Rio and Jerrica Benton/Jem, Starlight Music and Starlight House, the Starlight Girls, the villain Eric Raymond and various secondary characters. Later, Marx was asked to develop new characters as they were introduced, with several of them named after pioneers in the history of holography.

===Casting===
Samantha Newark provided the speaking voices of Jem and Jerrica. Despite having toured as a child singer in Africa, she did not do the singing for Jem. The voiceover cast never auditioned for the music side of the series and vice versa. The music for Jem was all cast and recorded in New York and Atlanta and the voiceover actors were cast and recorded in Burbank, California. They matched the speaking voices of the cast to the singing voices. Britta Phillips, who had never before worked professionally as a singer, was cast as the singing voice of Jem after obtaining an audition through her father who worked on jingles in New York. The initial take from the audition was used as the first opening theme song &quot;Truly Outrageous&quot;. The remaining Holograms speaking voices were provided by Cathianne Blore (Kimber Benton/Aja Leith), Cindy McGee (Shana Elmsford), and Linda Dangcil (Carmen &#x27;Raya&#x27; Alonso). The Misfits&#x27; speaking voices were provided by Patricia Alice Albrecht (Phyllis &quot;Pizzazz&quot; Gabor), Samantha Paris/Bobbie Block (Roxanne &quot;Roxy&quot; Pellegrini), Susan Blu (Mary &quot;Stormer&quot; Phillips), and Louise Dorsey (Sheila &quot;Jetta&quot; Burns), the daughter of Engelbert Humperdinck. Ellen Bernfeld provided the singing voice of Pizzazz. The Stingers&#x27; speaking voices were provided by Townsend Coleman (Rory &quot;Riot&quot; Llewelyn), Ellen Gerstell (Phoebe &quot;Rapture&quot; Ashe), and Kath Soucie (Ingrid &quot;Minx&quot; Kruger). Gordon Grody, a vocal coach who later worked with Lady Gaga, provided the singing voice for Riot. Other notable cast members included Charlie Adler as Eric Raymond. He also provided the voices of both of Eric&#x27;s major henchmen Zipper and Techrat. Vicki Sue Robinson, famous for the 1970s discothèque-oriented hit &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;, provided the singing voices of both Rapture and Minx. Ari Gold, pop singer and songwriter, gave the singing voice of Ba Nee.

===Music===

The inclusion of music videos in &quot;Jem&quot; was a result of the success and popularity of MTV (Music Television) at the time, which began airing four years prior. The show contains a total of 187 music videos with 151 unique songs. Over 200 original songs were written for the series. Several songs are featured on cassette tapes of Hasbro&#x27;s Jem toy line. Sunbow Productions employed several musicians and songwriters. Ford Kinder and Anne Bryant composed the music, and Barry Hamon wrote the lyrics of the songs. Britta Phillips performed as Jem, Ellen Bernfeld performed as Pizzazz, and Gordon Grody, performed as Riot. Anne Bryant, who chose the singers and musicians, created a pop sound for Jem and The Holograms supported by acoustic instruments. The sound for The Misfits was crafted as strictly electronic other than the addition of guitars and an occasional sax solo when the character of Jetta was introduced into The Misfits. This was done to create an identifiable punk electronica style in stark contrast to their rival singing groups. In season three, Bryant introduced the slower funky groove for the third group that entered the show, The Stingers.

=== Marketing ===
According to &quot;Newsday&quot; in 1986, the budget for the first year of advertising the franchise totaled approximately $10 million&quot;—&quot; a large sum for a multifaced line at the time. Along with the series, Hasbro promoted &quot;Jem&quot; with a complete line of toys and accessories, hoping to create the &quot;next fashion doll superstar in a market&quot;. Steven Eisenberg, a toy industry analyst at Bear Stearns, stated that the lineup would be &quot;very successful&quot; and &quot;represent a potentially significant challenge to Barbie.&quot; Alfred C. Carosi, Jr., former vice president of marketing services for Hasbro, also said, &quot;Jem is getting as much push in terms of marketing muscle as any major line&quot;, explaining that the marketing services promoted several &quot;Jem Coming Soon&quot; advertisements. In a response to an analysis chart of toy sales, Paul Valentine, a toy analyst at Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s Corporation, predicted the Jem toy line to be a flop. Hasbro&#x27;s first Jem doll line was unveiled on February 10, 1986, at Hasbro&#x27;s Madison Avenue showroom in New York City&#x27;s North American International Toy Fair. The showroom was filled with Jem dolls and decorated with neon colors, &quot;&quot;Miami Vice&quot;-styled&quot; fashions, and video screens with animation clips and commercials. In mid-1986, Nickelodeon partnered with Hasbro to sponsor a contest in which people were asked to call a toll-free telephone number and sing the theme song of the series. The grand prize was worth $7,000 and featured a trip to the MTV Video Music Awards in New York City. Other prizes included a 19-inch color television, a VCR and the &quot;Jem&quot; home video library, a dress identical to the one made for the Jem doll, and $1,000 cash. Carosi explained that the promotion &quot;added proof of &quot;Jem&quot;&#x27;s popularity&quot;, garnering more than 375,000 phone calls and breaking the telephone system once during the eight weeks of the contest. The contest winner was Keri King of Seymour, Indiana, who was chosen out of 325,000 children aged 12 and under.

=== Broadcast ===
&quot;Jem&quot; started airing 1985, in syndication. It consisted of one seven-minute short that aired every week as part of the &quot;Super Sunday&quot; lineup. On May 4, 1986, &quot;Jem&quot; started to air as a television series. Starting in September 1987, the series aired five times weekly. It has aired in multiple countries including Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, West Germany, Netherlands, United States, Italy and France. The series aired reruns on The Hub Network/Discovery Family from May 31, 2011, to November 15, 2015. On July 25, 2011, Teletoon Retro, a Canadian channel dedicated to cartoons, announced that &quot;Jem&quot; would be part of its fall 2011 lineup. On April 5, 2012, Hasbro announced that &quot;Jem&quot;, along with several other Hasbro franchises, will be available on Netflix.

The show was nominated for the Young Artist Award twice, once in 1986 for &quot;Exceptional Young Actresses in Animation: Series, Specials, or Film Features&quot; for Samantha Newark&#x27;s performance, then in 1988 for &quot;Best Animation Series&quot;.

==Franchise==
Christy Marx has long expressed a desire to make a modern-day revival of the animated series, but stated in a 2004 interview that there are a great deal of complications concerning the rights to the &quot;Jem&quot; properties.

===Dolls===
Hasbro&#x27;s first Jem toy line consisted of eight dolls, each packaged with a cassette tape, a few accessories and a poster, priced at $15 per doll. The cassettes contained the theme song &quot;Truly Outrageous&quot; and two other songs performed by Jem and The Holograms or The Misifts. The toy line also included the Jem Star Stage and Jem&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Roadster. As of June 1986, Jem&#x27;s sales surpassed those of their competitor Barbie and the Rockers. By September 1987, more than three million dolls had been sold since the toy line was introduced. In September 8, 2011, Hasbro issued a press release announcing its attendance at the New York Comic Con from October 13 -16, 2011, where it would be showing new and upcoming products at its booth, including those from &quot;Jem and The Holograms&quot;. 

In June 27, 2012, Integrity Toys, Inc. announced their plans to release a new series of collectible fashion dolls based on the TV series. The special edition Hollywood Jem doll became available at the Hasbro Toy Shop booth during Comic-Con International in San Diego at an approximate retail price of $135. The Jem doll sold out on day two of the convention. In October 5, 2012, the four (then-upcoming) dolls in Integrity Toys&#x27; new limited edition collectible line were presented with pictures: Classic Jem, Jerrica Benton, Synergy and Rio Pacheco, with a suggested retail price of $119, to begin shipping in late November 2012. Pre-orders were accepted through Integrity Toys&#x27; network of authorized dealers. As of October 2016, Integrity Toys has produced more than 40 different dolls based on the TV show.

In September 2024, The Loyal Subjects inked a deal with Hasbro to relaunch a host of legacy brands, including Jem and the Holograms. A 12-inch doll based on Jem / Jerrica was officially released in February 2025.

===Comics===
In 2011, Hasbro released a one-off comic book titled &quot;Unit:E&quot; as an exclusive at the New York Comic-Con; this was created by &quot;HasLab&quot; as a potential multi-brand crossover platform. The plot depicted Synergy, now an alien artificial intelligence, assisting the descendant of Acroyear and a Biotron from &quot;Micronauts&quot; in searching for heroes to help him combat Baron Karza. She shows them characters from &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;Battleship Galaxies&quot;, &quot;Stretch Armstrong&quot;, &quot;Action Man&quot;, &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot; and &quot;Candy Land&quot; among others. Jerrica herself is shown as not having taken up the Jem identity yet, but will eventually compose the &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; (presumably with Synergy&#x27;s aid). The comic was never followed up. The &quot;Jem&quot; comic book was released by IDW in March 2015: written by Kelly Thompson, art by Sophie Campbell and colors by M. Victoria Robado. The comic book offers a modern re-imagining of the series with new character designs and different situations, such as Jem and The Holograms and The Misfits being unsigned bands at the start with Eric Raymond being hired as The Misfits&#x27; manager during the second story arc. In addition, Kimber and Stormer begin a romantic relationship. As of Issue #16, which is Campbell&#x27;s final issue as regular artist, The Stingers have been introduced to the series with Raya featured as a fourth member of the band. The title&#x27;s current status within the new Hasbro Comic Book Universe (consisting of several new or relaunched titles, using the IDW &quot;Transformers&quot; comics as the backbone for a cohesive universe) has been somewhat erratic; IDW writers have generally indicated that, while characters from &quot;Jem&quot; will not show up in crossovers (including the &quot;Revolution&quot; mini-series that launched the universe), they do exist and will receive occasional references. The series ended on June 14, 2017, with issue #26, but a six-issue miniseries--&quot;Jem and The Holograms: Infinite #1 and Jem and The Holograms: Misfits Infinite #1&quot; was released later in the month. A one-shot &quot;Jem and The Holograms: IDW 20/20&quot; was published in January 2019 as part of &quot;IDW 20/20&quot; which celebrated the 20th anniversary of IDW Publishing. The comic takes place 20 years after the final issue of the ongoing comic.

===Film===

After the success of &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; and &quot;Transformers&quot; films, Hasbro began considering a live-action film adaptation or a new incarnation of the animated series with Universal Pictures, with which Hasbro had signed a six-film contract in 2010. On March 20, 2014, a live-action motion picture adaptation of &quot;Jem and The Holograms&quot; was announced, to be directed by Jon M. Chu. Filming on the production began in April 2014. On April 24, it was announced that Aubrey Peeples had been cast as Jem, with Stefanie Scott as Kimber, Hayley Kiyoko as Aja and Aurora Perrineau as Shana. On April 30, 2014, actor Ryan Guzman was cast as Rio. On May 20, Juliette Lewis and Molly Ringwald joined the film. The film was theatrically released on October 23, 2015; it received generally negative reviews from critics and fans, with criticism targeted at the angsty teen drama, strayed too far from the source material as well as original series fan content being manipulated into reaction to the in-film characters. It was a box office bomb, grossing less than half its $5 million budget, and was removed from theaters by Universal after two weeks. &quot;SF Weekly&quot; criticized the fan backlash as entitlement.

===Music===
Hasbro Studios with Legacy Recordings released its first non-soundtrack album, &quot;Truly Outrageous: A Tribute to Starlight Records&quot; on August 7, 2015. The record was part of the promotion of the &quot;Jem&quot; film. The album consisted of original songs that only had the titles and sometimes a few lyrics in common with the &quot;Jem&quot; TV series songs. This release was digital only.

<doc id="623797" wikidata="Q1796343" url="?curid=623797" title="Peace (law)">
<text>The legal term peace, sometimes king&#x27;s peace (Latin: ) or queen&#x27;s peace, is the common-law concept of the maintenance of public order.

The concept of the king&#x27;s peace originated in Anglo-Saxon law, where it initially applied the special protections accorded to the households of the English kings and their retainers. A breach of the king&#x27;s peace, which could be either a crime or a tort, was a serious matter. The concept of the king&#x27;s peace expanded in the 10th and 11th centuries to accord the king&#x27;s protection to particular times (such as holidays), places (such as highways and churches), and individuals (such as legates). By the time of the Norman Conquest, the notion of the king&#x27;s peace became more general, referring to the safeguarding of public order more broadly. In subsequent centuries, those responsible for enforcing the king&#x27;s peace (besides the king himself) included the King&#x27;s Bench and various local officials, including the sheriff, coroner, justice of the peace, and constable.

In modern Britain, the police services are responsible for keeping the peace, a duty distinct from their duty of law enforcement. The concept has remained relevant in English law; in &quot;R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Northumbria Police Authority&quot; (1989), the Court of Appeal for England and Wales held that the government could exercise prerogative powers to maintain the peace of the realm.

==In English law==
===Development in common law===
====Anglo-Saxon origins====
The notion of &quot;king&#x27;s peace&quot; originates in Anglo-Saxon law. Historian Bruce R. O&#x27;Brien notes that the concept was &quot;a vague statement of the inviolability of the king or his palace&quot; under the early English kings.

Maitland and Pollock describe the origins of the concept of the king&#x27;s peace as arising from (1) &quot;the special sanctity of the king&#x27;s house&quot; (the royal household or mund), &quot;which may be regarded as differing only in degree from that which Germanic usage attached everywhere to the homestead of a free man&quot;; and (2) &quot;the special protection of the king&#x27;s attendants and servants, and other persons who he thought fit to place on the same footing.&quot; Thus, Maitland and Pollock noted that &quot;breach of the king&#x27;s peace was an act of personal disobedience, and a much graver matter than an ordinary breach of the public order; it made the wrongdoer the king&#x27;s enemy&quot; who could be declared an outlaw.

Over time, the notion of king&#x27;s peace expanded, particularly in the 10th and 11th centuries. The expansion of the concept coincided with the expansion of the king&#x27;s household to encompass governmental institutions, including the chancery, exchequer, chamber, and royal courts of law. Under the reigns of Æthelred and Cnut, the concept of king&#x27;s peace had already extended to designated times, places, individuals, and institutions. Individuals and institutions under the king&#x27;s peace included , churches, and assemblies.

====Following the Norman Conquest====

Following the Norman Conquest, the &quot;king&#x27;s peace&quot; had extended to refer to &quot;the normal and general safeguard of public order&quot; in the realm, although specially granted peaces continued to be given after this period. Under the &quot;Leges Edwardi Confessoris&quot; (Laws of Edward the Confessor), the four great highways of the realm (the Roman roads of Watling Street, Icknield Street, Ermine Street, and Fosse Way) as well as navigable rivers were also under the king&#x27;s peace. The &quot;Leges Edwardi Confessoris&quot; provided that the weeks for Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost were under the king&#x27;s peace as well. Maitland commented that the king&#x27;s peace had begun to &quot;swallow up lesser peaces&quot; such as the peaces of local lords of the manor. For example, roads other than the four great Roman roads were formerly under the sheriffs&#x27; peace, but by the end of the 14th century had been brought under the king&#x27;s peace.

A breach of the king&#x27;s peace could be either a crime or a tort; one who breached the king&#x27;s peace could be pursued by an appeal of felony or writ of trespass (brought by the victim of the breach) or by an indictment of felony or indictment of trespass (brought on behalf of the king, frequently at the request of the victim). One who breached the king&#x27;s peace was subject to punishment for both the breach and for the underlying conduct, which could be in the form of a fine, forfeiture, imprisonment, corporal punishment, or capital punishment.

The Charter of Henry I, issued upon Henry&#x27;s coronation in 1100, stated: &quot;I establish a lasting peace throughout the whole of my kingdom and command that it henceforth be maintained.&quot; Historian John Hudson had commented that Henry I&#x27;s cornational declaration of peace was non-specific, but did emphasize &quot;the association of both the ideals and the practical enforcement of good order with firm kingship&quot; as characterized by, among other things, an expansion of royal judicial activity. Hudson writes: &quot;Thus the later precise legal notion of the king&#x27;s peace may have developed more from ideas of the general king&#x27;s peace, as manifest perhaps in shrieval grants and Henry&#x27;s coronation decree, than from specific grants of royal protection.&quot;

The binding over power of magistrates, which was first codified in the Justices of the Peace Act 1361, has partial roots in the early use of sureties of the peace, which &quot;emerged from the peace-keeping arrangements of Anglo-Saxon law, extended by the use of the royal prerogative and royal writs to bestow the king&#x27;s peace where the king wished until the peace became a nationwide legal reality.&quot; Sureties of the peace were replaced in the 13th and 14th centuries, as the institutions of keeper of the peace and then justice of the peace were established. The 19th-century legal commentator James Fitzjames Stephen wrote that the conservators of the king&#x27;s peace were the king, the great officers of state, and the King&#x27;s Bench on the national level, and the sheriffs, coroners, justices of the peace, and constables on the local level.

====Law of homicide====
In traditional common law, a killing of a human was a murder only if the victim was &quot;under the king&#x27;s peace&quot; (i.e., not an outlaw or an enemy soldier in wartime). This was predicated on the notion that, because the outlaw lived outside the king&#x27;s peace, the king would not punish offenses against the outlaw.

Historically, even homicides &quot;se defendendo&quot; (in self-defence) were considered offenses against the king, in that they deprived the king of the use of his subjects. As a result, killings in self-defense were treated as an excuse that required a royal pardon, rather than a justified act. Similarly, the maiming of a person was an offense against the king because it reduced &quot;the value of a human resource, in this case, by rendering him incapable of military service.&quot;

===Modern day===
Today, the preservation of the King&#x27;s Peace is the major responsibility of police services. Lord Scarman, in his report on the 1981 Brixton riot, defined the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Peace&quot; as the maintenance of &quot;the normal state of society&quot; (i.e., a &quot;state of public tranquility&quot;) and defined it as the first duty of a police officer, ahead of the second duty of enforcing the law. In a 2011 speech to the Police Foundation, Lord Judge (the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales) said, &quot;The concept Queen&#x27;s Peace as it now is, unbreakably linked with the common law, is arguably the most cherished of all the ideas from our medieval past, still resonating in the modern world.&quot; He noted that the police officers take an oath to &quot;cause the peace to be kept and preserved and prevent all offences against people and property.&quot;

In the controversial decision in &quot;R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Northumbria Police Authority&quot; (1989), the Court of Appeal for England and Wales held that the Home Secretary could exercise prerogative powers to maintain the peace of the realm. The court thus ruled that the Home Secretary had the power to purchase crowd control devices, such as plastic bullets and CS gas, even without statutory authorization or the approval of the local police authority.

====Breach of the peace====

In modern English law, a breach of the peace is not itself a crime. However, &quot;where a breach of the peace has been committed or, alternatively, where such a breach is reasonably believed to be imminent, a police officer, or for that matter a member of the public, has the power at common law to arrest without warrant the individual or individuals who have either committed or are about to commit that breach of the peace even though no offence has actually been committed.&quot; This is a form of preventive arrest. Under the Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1980, a magistrate has the power to &quot;bind over&quot; a person to keep the peace (i.e., to forfeit a sum of money upon a subsequent breach of the peace), and &quot;refusal to be bound over to keep the peace is an offence in English law, punishable by up to six months&#x27; imprisonment.&quot; Moreover, the obstruction of an officer engaged in preventing a breach of the peace is a criminal offence.

The case &quot;R v Howell&quot; (1981) defined breach of the peace as &quot;harm ... actually done or likely to be done to a person or, in his presence, his property or is put in fear of being harmed through an assault, affray, riot, unlawful assembly or other disturbance.&quot; In the 1998 case of &quot;Steel v UK&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights decided that this was a lawful restriction of the freedom of assembly under Article 5 and Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

==Medieval Scotland==
Unlike medieval England, there is no strong evidence &quot;for a strong conceptual and ideological royal peace&quot; concept in medieval Scotland; however, historian Alan Harding argues that 12th-century royal brieves of protection issued by Scottish kings implicitly reflect the same concept. Historian Patrick Wormald suggests that Anglo-Saxon law and Scots law developed in parallel, and that the &quot;seminal notion of vesting social security in the protection afforded by the king&#x27;s peace&quot; applied in both Scotland and England, with very early origins.

==Outside Britain==

===American law===
After the American Revolution, American law merely adapted the common-law concept of the king&#x27;s peace to refer to the maintenance of public order, and the concept of &quot;an offense against the king&#x27;s peace&quot; to refer to an offense against the new sovereign—the people or the state. In the United States, the common law offense of breach of the peace was supplanted by the statutory offense of disturbing the peace. The separate offense of disorderly conduct has no common-law roots, but in most U.S. jurisdictions this offense &quot;often is indistinguishable from&quot; disturbing the peace. The application of criminal statutes on disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct have been limited by constitutional jurisprudence on the First Amendment, including the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s rulings in &quot;Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire&quot; (1942) and &quot;Colten v. Kentucky&quot; (1972).

===Australian law===
As a common-law nation, the notion of &quot;breach of the Queen&#x27;s peace&quot; endures in Australia. In the High Court of Australia decision &quot;Lipohar v R&quot; (1999), a decision dealing with jurisdiction to try a case for the common-law crime of conspiracy to defraud, Justices Gaudron, Gummow, and Hayne quoted a 1973 decision by the English judge Lord Wilberforce that &quot;the common law treats certain actions as crimes&quot; on the ground that the &quot;actions in question are a threat to the Queen&#x27;s peace, or, as we would now perhaps say, to society.&quot;

==Significance in historiography and history of crime==
The concept of the king&#x27;s peace is significant in the historiography of medieval England, particularly regarding the study of the origin of the idea of crime. &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; defines the term as &quot;the king&#x27;s guarantee of peace and security of life and property to all within his protection.&quot; The notion of the king&#x27;s peace is linked to the idea of police power and, more generally, sovereign power.

<text>The  (, , ; ; sometimes also spelled ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s national epics. It is a Thai version of the ancient Indian epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, and an important part of the Thai literary canon.

King Rama VI was the person who shed the light first on the &quot;Ramayana&quot; studies in Thailand, by tracing the sources of the , comparing it with the Sanskrit &quot;Valmiki Ramayana&quot;. He found that the was influenced by three sources: the Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana, the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, and &quot;Hanuman Nataka&quot; (all three are from mythology). A number of versions of the epic were lost in the destruction of Ayutthaya in 1767. Three versions currently exist, one of which was prepared in 1797 under the supervision of (and partly written by) King Rama I. His son, Rama II, rewrote some parts of his father&#x27;s version for &quot;khon&quot; drama. The work has had an important influence on Thai literature, art and drama (both the &quot;khon&quot; and &quot;nang&quot; dramas being derived from it).

While the main story is similar to that of the &quot;Dasaratha Nataka&quot;, differences in some tales still prevail. Many other aspects were transposed into a Thai context, such as the clothes, weapons, topography, and elements of nature, which are described as being Thai in style. As Thailand is considered a Theravada Buddhist society, the Buddhist history latent in the serves to provide Thai legends with a creation myth, as well as representations of various spirits which complement beliefs derived from Thai animism.

A painted representation of the is displayed at Bangkok&#x27;s Temple of Emerald Buddha, and many of the statues there depict characters from it.

==Background==
The Jatakas including &quot;Dasaratha Jataka&quot; came to Southeast Asia by means of Buddhist missionaries, Indian traders and scholars who traded with Khmer kingdoms (such as Funan and Angkor) and Srivijaya, with whom the Indians shared close economic and cultural ties. The Thai adopted from the Khmer people components of Indianized culture such as the &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

In the late first millennium, the epic (written as , but read as ) was adopted by the Thai people. The oldest recordings of the early Sukhothai kingdom, dating from the 13th century, include stories from the Jataka legends. The history of the legends was told in the shade theater (Thai: , ), a shadow-puppet show in a style adopted from Indonesia, in which the characters were portrayed by leather dolls manipulated to cast shadows on a nearby screen as the audience watched from the other side.

The Thai version was first written down in the 18th century, during the Ayutthaya Kingdom, following the demise of the Sukhothai government. Most editions, however, were lost when the city of Ayutthaya was destroyed by armies from Burma (modern Myanmar) in the year 1767.

The version recognized today was compiled in the Kingdom of Siam under the supervision of King Rama I (1726–1809), the founder of the Chakri dynasty, which still maintains the throne of Thailand. Between the years of 1799 and 1807, Rama I supervised this well-known recension and even wrote parts of it. It was also under his reign that construction began on the Thai Grand Palace in Bangkok, which includes the grounds of the Wat Phra Kaew, enshrining the Emerald Buddha. The walls of the Wat Phra Kaew are lavishly decorated with paintings representing parts of the .

Rama II (1766–1824) further adapted his father&#x27;s edition of the for &quot;khon&quot; drama, a form of theater performed by non-speaking Thai dancers in elaborate costumes and masks. Narrations from the were read by a chorus to one side of the stage. This version differs slightly from the one compiled by Rama I, giving an expanded role to Hanuman, the god-king of the apes, and adding a happy ending.

Since its introduction to the Thai people, the has become a firm component of culture. The of Rama I is considered a masterpiece of Thai literature, and is still read and taught in the country&#x27;s schools.

In 1989, Satyavrat Shastri translated the into a Sanskrit epic poem (&quot;mahakavya&quot;) named , in 25 s (cantos) and about 1,200 stanzas in 14 metres. This work won eleven national and international awards.

==Content==
The tales of the are similar to those of the Ramayana, though transferred to the topography and culture of Ayutthaya, where the Avatar of Phra Narai (the Thai incarnation of Vishnu, who is also known as Narayana, Govinda, Vasudeva) is reborn as Phra Ram.

=== Plot ===
The text can be split into three logical parts: the first one dealing with the origins of the main characters, the second depicting the dramatic events including the fall of Thotsakan, and the final part describing what happened afterwards.

==== Part One ====
The first part begins with the story of Phra Narai in the form of a boar vanquishing the demon Hiranyaksha. This is followed by an account of the origins of the ancestors of Thotsakan. According to Ramakien, Phra Isuan grants his servant Nonthok (Bhasmasura) a boon which enables him to change his finger into a diamond and destroy anyone at whom he points it. As Nonthok begins to abuse this power, Phra Narai assumes the form of a charming woman who dances in front of Nonthok, who tries to imitate the movement of her hands. At one moment, he points the diamond finger towards himself and instantly dies. Nonthok is later reborn as Thotsakan. He also has four brothers and a sister, as well as half-siblings. Thotsakan first marries Kala Akhi (Mandodari), the daughter of Kala Nakha (Mayasura) of the underworld, and later receives Nang Montho as a gift from Phra Isuan. Thotsakan and Kala Akhi have a son with the first name Ronapak (Meghanada); after his victory over Indra, he is called Intharachit(Winner of Indra).

The text then explains the origins of the simian characters Phali and Sukhrip. They are born to Kala Acana (Anjana), the wife of king Khodam (Kesari), as a result of her adultery with Phra In and Phra Athit. When king Khodam immerses them in a lake to test their legitimacy, they turn into monkeys and vanish into the forest. Phra Isuan grants Phali a magic trident which will transfer to Phali half the strength of anyone fighting him. Sukhrip is rewarded with a beautiful young maiden Dara (Tara), but Phali takes her for himself. Later, Phali also seizes Thotsakan&#x27;s consort Nang Montho and they have a son named Ongkhot before she is returned to Thotsakan. Finally, Phali banishes Sukhrip to the forest where he meets Hanuman.

Hanuman is said to be born after Phra Isuan places his celestial weapons in the mouth of Sawaha, the daughter of Kala Acana. Hanuman at first stays with Phali and Sukhrip, but later decides to join Sukhrip in his banishment in the forest.

Rama, known in the Ramakien as Phra Ram, has ancestors tracing back to Phra Narai through King Thotsarot. Phra Ram himself is a reincarnation of Phra Narai, and his brothers Phra Lak, Phra Phrot and Phra Satarut are manifestations of Phra Narai&#x27;s emblems: the serpent, the discus, and the mace, respectively. Phra Ram&#x27;s consort Nang Sida is a reincarnation of Phra Narai&#x27;s consort Laksami, but she is born as the daughter of Thotsakan in Lanka and adopted by king Chonok (Janaka) of Mithila.

==== Part Two ====
Part two deals with the main drama of the story. Phra Ram and Nang Sida fall in love at first sight before an archery contest. A hunchback named Kucci (Manthara) instigates the queen to ask for the banishment of Phra Ram. He sets off to live in the forest with Nang Sida and his brother Phra Lak, where they meet Sammanakha (Surpanakha) who took on the form of a beautiful maiden. She tries to seduce the two brothers, but they resist and punish her. As revenge, Thotsakan abducts Nang Sida to his palace in Lanka.

Phra Ram and Phra Lak meet Hanuman, Sukhrip and another Vanara, Chomphuphan, and ask them to help find Nang Sida. When Hanuman locates Nang Sida in Lanka, he identifies himself by showing her ring and kerchief and retelling the secret of her first meeting with Phra Ram. Hanuman is then caught by Thotsakan&#x27;s son Intharachit, but escapes while setting Lanka on fire. On returning to Phra Ram, Hanuman helps build a causeway with help of Nal and Nil to connecting Sri Lanka With Indian mainland and the war with Thotsakan begins. After a lot of fighting and attempts of treachery by Thotsakan&#x27;s allies, Phra Ram manages to kill Thotsakan and Intharachit and free Nang Sida. After she passes a fire ordeal to test her faithfulness, Phra Ram takes her with him to Ayutthaya and grants various parts of his kingdom to his allies.

==== Part three ====
After Nang Sida draws a picture of Thotsakan on a slate, Phra Ram orders Phra Lak to take her to the forest and kill her. Instead of doing as commanded, he brings to Phra Ram the heart of a doe to trick him into believing that Nang Sida is dead. In the forest, Nang Sida finds refuge with a hermit named Wachamarik Valmiki, and she gives birth to two sons: Phra Monkut (Kusha) and Phra Loph (Lava). Phra Ram decides to take her back to Ayutthaya, but she refuses and disappears into the Underworld. Finally, Phra Isuan brings Phra Ram and Nang Sida together again.

<text>Ama Ata Aidoo (March 32,1942—May 31 2023) was a Ghanaian author, poet, playwright, politician, and academic. She was a Secretary for Education in Ghana from 1982 to 1983 under Jerry Rawlings&#x27;s PNDC administration. Her first play, &quot;The Dilemma of a Ghost&quot;, was published in 1965, making Aidoo the first published female African dramatist. As a novelist, she won the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize in 1992 with the novel &quot;&quot;. In 2000, she established the Mbaasem Foundation in Accra to promote and support the work of African women writers.

==Early life==
Christina Ama Ata Aidoo was born on 23 March 1942 in Abeadzi Kyiakor, near Saltpond, in the Central Region of Ghana. She was initially called Christiana Ama Aidoo. Some sources ( including Megan Behrent, Brown University, and &quot;Africa Who&#x27;s Who&quot;) have stated that she was born on 31 March. She had a twin brother, Kwame Ata.

Aidoo was raised in a Fante royal household, the daughter of Nana Yaw Fama, chief of Abeadzi Kyiakor, and Maame Abasema. Her grandfather was murdered by neocolonialists, which brought her father&#x27;s attention to the importance of educating the children and families of the village on the history and events of the era. This led him to open up the first school in their village and influenced Aidoo to attend Wesley Girls&#x27; High School, where she first decided she wanted to be a writer.

== Education ==
From 1957, Aidoo attended Wesley Girls&#x27; Senior High School in Cape Coast. After high school, she enrolled in 1961 at the University of Ghana, Legon, where she obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts in English and wrote her first play, &quot;The Dilemma of a Ghost&quot;, in 1964. The play was published by Longman the following year, making Aidoo the first published female African dramatist.

== Career ==
After graduating, Aidoo held a fellowship in creative writing at Stanford University in California before returning to Ghana in 1969 to teach English at the University of Ghana. She served as a research fellow at the Institute of African Studies there and as a lecturer in English at the University of Cape Coast, where she eventually rose to the position of professor.

Aidoo was appointed Minister of Education under the Provisional National Defence Council in 1982. She resigned after 18 months, realizing that she would be unable to achieve her aim of making education in Ghana freely accessible to all. She has portrayed the role of African women in contemporary society. She has opined that the idea of nationalism has been deployed by recent leaders as a means of keeping people oppressed. She criticized those literate Africans who profess to love their country but are seduced by the benefits of the developed world. She believed in a distinct African identity, which she viewed from a female perspective. She held strong Pan-Africanist views on the necessity of unity among African countries and was outspoken about the centuries of exploitation of the Africa&#x27;s resources and peoples.

In 1983, she moved to live in Zimbabwe, where she continued her work in education, including as a curriculum developer for the Zimbabwe Ministry of Education, as well as writing. While in Harare, she published a collection of poems in 1985, &quot;Someone Talking to Sometime&quot;, and wrote a children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;The Eagle and the Chickens and Other Stories&quot; (1986).

In London, England, in 1986, she delivered the Walter Rodney Visions of Africa lecture organized by the support group of Bogle-L&#x27;Ouverture publishing house.

Aidoo received a Fulbright Scholarship award in 1988, was writer-in-residence at the University of Richmond, Virginia in 1989, and taught various English courses at Hamilton College in Clinton New York in the early mid-1990s.

In 1991, she and African-American poet Jayne Cortez established and co-chaired the Organization of Women Writers of Africa (OWWA), and board members of OWWA have included J. E. Franklin, Cheryll Y. Greene, Rashidah Ismaili, Louise Meriwether, Maya Angelou, Rosamond S. King, Margaret Busby, Gabrielle Civil, Alexis De Veaux, LaTasha N. Diggs, Zetta Elliott, Donette Francis, Paula Giddings, Renée Larrier, Tess Onwueme, Coumba Touré, Maryse Condé, Nancy Morejón, and Sapphire.

From 2004 to 2011, Aidoo was a visiting professor in the Africana Studies Department at Brown University.

She chaired the Ghana Association of Writers Book Festival from its inception in 2011.

Aidoo was a patron of the Etisalat Prize for Literature (alongside Dele Olojede, Ellah Wakatama Allfrey, Margaret Busby, Sarah Ladipo Manyika, and Zakes Mda), created in 2013 as a platform for African writers of debut novels of fiction.

== Writings ==
Aidoo&#x27;s plays include &quot;The Dilemma of a Ghost&quot;, produced at Legon in 1964 (first published in 1965) and Pittsburgh in 1988, and &quot;Anowa&quot;, published in 1971 and produced at the Gate Theatre in London in 1991.

Her works of fiction particularly deal with the tension between Western and African worldviews. Her first novel, &quot;Our Sister Killjoy&quot;, was published in 1977 and remains one of her most popular works. It is notable for portraying a dissenting perspective on sexuality in Africa, and especially LGBT in Africa. Whereas one popular idea on the continent is that homosexuality is alien to Africa and an intrusion of ideas of Western culture into a pure, inherently heterosexual &quot;African&quot; culture, Aidoo portrays the main character of &quot;Killjoy&quot; as indulging in lesbian fantasies of her own, and maintaining sympathetic relationships with lesbian characters.

Many of Aidoo&#x27;s other protagonists are also women who defy the stereotypical women&#x27;s roles of their time, as in her play &quot;Anowa&quot;. Her novel &quot;&quot; won the 1992 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize for Best Book (Africa). She was also an accomplished poet—her collection &quot;Someone Talking to Sometime&quot; won the Nelson Mandela Prize for Poetry in 1987—and the author of several children&#x27;s books.

Aidoo contributed the piece &quot;To be a woman&quot; to the 1984 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women&#x27;s Movement Anthology&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan. Her story &quot;Two Sisters&quot; appears in the 1992 anthology &quot;Daughters of Africa&quot;, edited by Margaret Busby.

In 2000, Aidoo founded the Mbaasem Foundation, a non-governmental organization based in Ghana with a mission &quot;to support the development and sustainability of African women writers and their artistic output&quot;, which she ran together with her daughter Kinna Likimani and a board of management.

Aidoo was editor of the anthology &quot;African Love Stories&quot; (Ayebia, 2006), a collection of 21 stories by writers including Chika Unigwe, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Doreen Baingana, Nawal El Saadawi, Helen Oyeyemi, Leila Aboulela, Molara Ogundipe, Monica Arac de Nyeko, Sarah Ladipo Manyika, Sefi Atta, Sindiwe Magona, and Véronique Tadjo. In 2012, Aidoo published &quot;Diplomatic Pounds &amp; Other Stories&quot;, a compilation of short stories.

==Death==
Aidoo died on 31 May 2023 in Accra. Praising her as &quot;an outstanding writer, advocate for women&#x27;s cause, the cause of Africans and the progressive people around the world&quot;, President Nana Akufo-Addo announced that she would be given a state funeral, with rites held from 13 July to 16 July, On 13 July, her funeral took place in the forecourt of the State House, followed by lying-in-state at her home town of Abeadze Kyiakor on 15 July, and a thanksgiving church service and burial on Sunday, 16 July.

== Honours and recognition ==
Aidoo received several awards, including winning the Mbari Club prize in 1962 for her short story &quot;No Sweetness Here&quot;, and the 1992 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize for Best Book (Africa) for her novel &quot;Changes&quot;.

In 2012, the volume &quot;Essays in honour of Ama Ata Aidoo at 70&quot; was published, edited by Anne V. Adams, with contributors including Atukwei Okai, Margaret Busby, Maryse Condé, Micere Mugo, Toyin Falola, Biodun Jeyifo, Kofi Anyidoho, Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, Naana Banyiwa Horne, Nana Wilson-Tagoe, Carole Boyce Davies, Emmanuel Akyeampong, James Gibbs, Vincent O. Odamtten, Jane Bryce, Esi Sutherland-Addy, Femi Osofisan, Kwesi Yankah, Abena Busia, Yaba Badoe, Ivor Agyeman-Duah, Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, Ngugi Wa Thiong&#x27;o, Kinna Likimani, and others.

Aidoo was the subject of a 2014 documentary film, &quot;The Art of Ama Ata Aidoo&quot;, made by Yaba Badoe.

The Aidoo-Snyder Book Prize, awarded by the Women&#x27;s Caucus of the African Studies Association for an outstanding book published by a woman that prioritizes African women&#x27;s experiences, is named in honour of Ama Ata Aidoo and of Margaret C. Snyder, who was the founding director of UNIFEM.

In 2016, Aidoo&#x27;s plays &quot;The Dilemma of a Ghost&quot; and &quot;Anowa&quot; were included as African Drama selections in the Cambridge International Examinations.

Launched in March 2017, the Ama Ata Aidoo Centre for Creative Writing (Aidoo Centre), under the auspices of the Kojo Yankah School of Communications Studies at the African University College of Communications (AUCC) in Adabraka, Accra, was named in her honour—the first centre of its kind in West Africa, with Nii Ayikwei Parkes as its director.

<text>Reamker (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ; ) is a Cambodian epic poem, based on the Sanskrit&#x27;s Rāmāyana epic. The name means &quot;Glory of Rama&quot;. It is the national epic of Cambodia, along with the less famous version of the &quot;Trai Bhet&quot;. The earliest mention of this epic&#x27;s manuscript in Cambodia dates back to the 7th century based on Veal Kantel inscription (K.359). The surviving text of Reamker dates from 16th century. Reamker adapts the Hindu ideas of the Ramayana to Buddhist themes and shows the balance of good and evil in the world. More than just a reordering of the epic tale, the Reamker is a mainstay of the royal ballet&#x27;s repertoire. Like the Ramayana, it is a philosophical allegory, exploring the ideals of justice and fidelity as embodied by the protagonists, King Rāma and Queen Sītā. The epic is well known among the Khmer people for its portrayal in Khmer dance theatre, called the &quot;Lakhon&quot; ( ), in various festivals across Cambodia. Scenes from the Reamker are painted on the walls of the Royal Palace in Khmer style, and its predecessor is carved into the walls of the Angkor Wat and Banteay Srei temples. It is considered an integral part of Cambodian culture.

The Reamker differs from the original Rāmāyana in some ways, featuring additional scenes and emphasis on Hanumān and Suvannamaccha.

In the Reamker, issues of trust, loyalty, love, and revenge play out in dramatic encounters among princes and giants, monkeys and mermaids, and a forlorn princess. Though it is understood that Preah Ream is an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, his characteristics and those of the others in the story are interpreted in Cambodia as those of mere mortals, not of the gods as is the case in India. The complex interplay of strengths and weaknesses, though couched in episodes lined with magic, nonetheless represents a decidedly human social behavior.

As in other Southeast Asian countries, the Rāma story in Cambodia is not confined to the realm of literature but extends to all Cambodian art forms, from sculpture to dance drama, painting and art. Another epic, &quot;The Poem of Angkor Wat&quot; ( ), which dates from the beginning of the 17th century, celebrates the magnificent temple complex at Angkor and describes the bas-reliefs in the temple galleries that portray the Rāma story.

==History==

The original Ramayana arrived to Southeast Asia from South India along with Hinduism, but its retelling there suggests Buddhist influence.

The exact time when was Ramayana introduced to Cambodia is unknown, however, the earliest mentioning of the epic dated to 7th century according to a stone inscription at Veal Kantel, Stueng Treng. Based on the same inscription, the manuscript of this epic already existed in Cambodia as the inscription mentioned the offering of the epic&#x27;s manuscript to a temple which expressed its importance in Khmer belief. On the other hand, the surviving text of Reamker dated in 16th century. Intricate carvings on the walls of Angkor Wat depict a scene from the Ramayana dating back nearly a millennium. Statues of the poem&#x27;s heroes were worshiped in temple sanctuaries, akin to the wall paintings at Cambodia&#x27;s Royal Palace and Wat Bo. The Ramayana has been an important epic in India for at least two thousand years, and Reamker is its Khmer adaptation. The Cambodian version includes incidents and details not found in the Sanskrit original. An example of a story that does not appear in Indian texts and performance is that of the encounter between Hanuman, the monkey general, and Sovanna Maccha, the mermaid, a favorite of Cambodian audiences.

==Literary Text of Reamker==
The exact time or when was Ramaya or Reamker text existed in Cambodia is unknown. However, plenty of art works and inscriptions mentioning the epic were made throughout ancient Cambodia (Funan, Chenla, and Angkor). The earliest evidence regarding the presence of Ramayana text in Cambodia can be found in a 7th-century inscription of Veal Kantel (K.359), where it mentioned the offering of Mahabhrata and Ramayana manuscripts to the temple as well as the daily recitation of the texts.

The Khmer version of Ramayana bears the name &quot;Reamker (Ramakerti)-&quot;literally means &quot;The Glory of Rama&quot;. Indeed, the story of Rama is present in both art and literature throughout the history of Cambodia. Cambodian Ramayana contains some incidents that could not find in Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana. For instance, the episode of the destruction of Rama&#x27;s causeway connecting Lanka by fishes and the reconstruction of this causeway as portrayed in a lintel of a Khmer temple at Phimai is believed to have emerged from a local development or the imagination of narrator. However, no literary work prior to 15th century has survived but numerous stone inscriptions or epigraphs have been preserved. From 15th century onward, the story of Rama became an impetus in Khmer literature, mainly in the epic genre, whereby the lengthy poems were composed as recitatives for the masked drama called Khol.

Poems narrating the story or the fame of Rama, called Reamker or Ramakerti appeared in the middle period of Khmer History. The surviving literary text of Reamker dated back to 16th century. This Reamker text was composed by at least three unknown authors over centuries and divided into two part.

The first part was composed between 16th to 17th century. The earliest writing accounts for about a fifth of the first part, covering the main events of the Bālakāṇḍa and Ayodhyakāṇḍa. It continued in the 17th century up to the episode where Ravana assembles the remnants of his army for the last battle with Rama. But the episode concerning Ravan&#x27;s death, the rescue of Sita and her trial by fire, and the triumphant return to Ayodhya are all missing.

The second part of Reamker was composed in 18th century deals specifically with the later history of Rama and Sita. This part includes Sita&#x27;s second rejection and exile, the birth of their two sons, the meeting again, and Sita&#x27;s going down to the earth.

The Reamker differs from the original Ramayana in some ways, featuring additional scenes and emphasis on Hanuman and Sovanna Maccha in which this scene occurs during the construction of causeway connecting Lanka.

Reamker is also mentioned in another literature called &quot;L&#x27;berk Angkor Wat&quot; (“The Story of Angkor Wat”) written in 1620 by Khmer author-Pang Tat (or Nak Pang), celebrating the magnificent temple complex of Angkor Wat and describing the bas-reliefs in the temple galleries that portray the Rama story.

In 1900s, Ta Krud and Ta Chak were the two old men famous for their remarkable memory and ability to narrate the whole Reamker story orally and beautifully with gesture. In 1920, Ta Chak found voluminous manuscripts of Reamker story on latanier leaves in a pagoda south of Angkor Wat temple during his monk-hood and he learnt to remember the script by heart. In 1969, Ta Chak&#x27;s oral narration were recorded and his narration lasted 10 days at the rate of five hours per day. However, he died earlier before he could manage to narrate the remaining episodes.

Many versions of Reamker are available in Cambodia. Nowadays, Reamker is considered as Cambodian national epic which plays significant role in Cambodian literature and extends to all Cambodian art forms, from sculpture to dance drama, painting and art.

==Central plot==
The Reamker plot begins with its protagonist, Preah Ream or Rama, being sent into exile by one of the queen mothers who wanted her own son to inherit the throne. After being sent to the forest, Preah Ream is joined by his beautiful and faithful wife Neang Seda (Sita), whom the prince won from her father by being the only Prince who successfully completed the father&#x27;s challenge of firing arrows through a spinning wheel with spokes. Preah Leak (Lakshmana), the younger brother of Preah Ream, is concerned about his older brother and joins Neang Seda.
While entering the forest, Neang Seda and Preah Leak meet the rakshasi Surpanakhar (Surphanakha) who first attempts to seduce Preah Ream, and then Preah Leak. Preah Leak, annoyed by the demon&#x27;s action, cuts off her ear and nose. The butchered Surpanakhar thirsting for revenge went to her ten-headed brother Krong Reap (Ravana), invincible lord of the island of Lanka. Krong Reap secretly goes to the forest. When he first set eyes on Neang Seda, he was awed by her divine beauty. Krong Reap transforms himself as a golden deer and runs past the party of three. Preah Ream realizes that the deer is not a real deer, however, at Neang Seda&#x27;s insistence Preah Ream chases it after telling his younger brother to stay and guard his wife. Krong Reap then mimics Preah Ream&#x27;s voice and calls for his brother to come and save him. Although Preah Leak knows that it is not his brother calling out, he is forced to go at Neang Seda&#x27;s insistence. However, before he leaves he draws a magical circle around his brother&#x27;s wife in the dirt that will prevent anything from entering the circle. Krong Reap disguises himself as an old errant and easily tricks Neang Seda&#x27;s to step outside the circle, after which he abducts her. Preah Ream and Preah Leak return and desperately search for Neang Seda and, in the meantime, they assist the monkey king Sukreep (Sugriva) to destroy his rival Pali Thirat (Vali) and regain his throne. Thanking the two, Sukreep sends the monkey warrior Hanuman to aid them in their search. Hanuman, the son of the wind god, flies out to discover that the demon Krong Reap held Neang Seda prisoner on the island of Lanka.

Hanuman order his soldiers to build a bridge of stone to connect the island Lanka to the mainland. While gathering stones, Hanuman realizes that mermaids were stealing stones to prevent the construction of the bridge. He was roused by this and decides to capture the mermaid princess Neang Machha but falls deeply in love with her. The mermaid likewise falls in love, and thus her mermaid army ceases to tamper in Hanuman&#x27;s business. The bridge built, Preah Ream and Krong Reap face each other in combat. However, Krong Reap quickly regenerates and damage done to him or any body part that is cut off. It is not until one of Krong Reap&#x27;s generals defects and discloses the secret to slaying the demon - an arrow in the belly button. With Hanuman&#x27;s aid, they slay the demon. Preah Ream, victorious in his battles, returns to the capital of Ayuthea and ascends the throne. Preah Ream suspects infidelity as his wife was captive of a very smart and manipulative demon. Trust issues between him and his wife Neang Seda arise after his wife draws a picture of Krong Reap at the insistence of her maid servant (as the demon&#x27;s true face was said to be the ugliest face there was). Fearing her husband&#x27;s jealousy, Neang Seda puts the picture under the mattress when she is unexpectedly interrupted. Krong Reap&#x27;s power extends to the picture and that night spikes grow from it and poke Preah Ream through the mattress. He discovers the picture and believes that it confirms his suspicion that his wife succumbed to Krong Reap&#x27;s persistent attempts to bed her over the years that she was held prisoner. However, Neang Seda had resisted all Krong Reap&#x27;s attempts, even that in which Krong Reap transformed himself into her husband. Only his scent had given his disguise away. Preah Ream forces his wife to take the trial of fire to prove she is still pure. Neang Seda passes the test. However, Neang Seda is deeply offended by her husband&#x27;s lack of trust in her and his lack of belief in her word. She decides to leave and find refuge with Valmiki the wiseman, where she gives birth to twin boys. They met their father and he immediately recognizes who they are and takes them to his palace.

<text>Wiarton () is a community in the town of South Bruce Peninsula, Bruce County, Ontario, Canada. It is located at the western end of Colpoys Bay, an inlet off Georgian Bay, on the Bruce Peninsula.

Wiarton is notable for the Wiarton Willie Festival, in February each year (starting in 1956), when national and international media cover Wiarton Willie and his Groundhog Day prediction. In the summer, Wiarton hosts the Bruce Peninsula Multisport Race.

==History==
Wiarton was named after the birthplace of Sir Edmund Head, the Governor General of Canada from 1854 to 1861. In 1880, Wiarton was incorporated as a village, then with a population of 750. By 1894, Wiarton had become an incorporated town.

The Government of Ontario has erected two historic plaques in Wiarton, offering a glimpse into the past of this area. The first discusses the fact that the Bruce Peninsula is a barrier to water transportation between Lake Huron and southern Georgian Bay. To avoid a difficult detour to the north, aboriginal peoples developed a portage route across the base of the peninsula. &quot;For centuries, the Bruce Peninsula portage was an important link in the Great Lakes transportation network.&quot; The second plaque discusses developments in the 1800s, starting with 1855 when &quot;a town-plot was laid out here on recently acquired Indigenous land and named Wiarton, reputedly after the English birthplace of Edmund Head, Governor General of Canada (1854-61)&quot;.

Until 1997, when the service was transferred to Thunder Bay, Ontario, Wiarton was known around Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, as the home of Wiarton Coast Guard Radio, providing continuous weather reports to mariners and residents.

In 1999, Wiarton was administratively amalgamated into the new municipality of the Town of South Bruce Peninsula.

=== Historical timeline, 1850 to 1906 ===

Although specific dates vary depending on the source, the following are excerpted from a reliable source, History of the County of Bruce, Ontario, Canada, by Norman Robertson, published in 1906.

* Mid 1800s: Settlers are arriving and opening businesses. Since there is no wharf for shipping, the community developed on top of the hill, the business centre being at the corner where Gould Street is crossed by Division Street. 
* 1868: B. B. Miller opens a hotel and post-office; two others open stores. 
* 1870s: Wharves are constructed and mills erected; many places of business move to Berford Street; by 1879, Gould Street is largely residential.
* 1868-70: A steam ship from Collingwood, named the Hero, arrives once or twice a week. By 1869, the steamer Champion makes daily trips to Owen Sound, for improved trade such as the marketing of grain. A dock and warehouse are built. A pharmacy, sawmill and stores open. 
* 1870: A published directory indicates &quot;Population about 200, grain and lumber form the principal trade here. It has a mail four times a week&quot;. There are two hotels by this time. 
* 1876: Population is now about 400. A stagecoach is making regular trips to and from Owen Sound. The electric telegraph has reached the town. There is now a grist mill, two steam mills, a planning mill and a tannery. Four churches are holding services. 
* 1877: A stone school house and two additional churches are built 
* 1880: Wiarton becomes an incorporated village with a population of 752. 
* 1882: The railway reaches the village; this will soon make Wiarton into &quot;the commercial entrepot for the peninsula&quot;.
* 1891: The old public school building is expanded and made into a high school.
* 1893: Wiarton is incorporated into a town, effective 1 January 1894. The first mayor is B. B. Millar. 
* 1900: After council meetings at makeshift premises, a new town hall opens. By now, several large furniture manufacturing facilities, a woolen mill, and a foundry are operating. The Dominion Fish Co. has its central packing plant in Wiarton where some 120,000 pounds of fish are received each week, to be cleaned, frozen, packed and shipped. 
* 1902-1904: The Wiarton Beet Sugar Manufacturing Company, Limited is built, opens and declares bankruptcy during this time, leaving huge debts.
* 1906: Robertson recaps the recent history: &quot;Wiarton has made more rapid progress than any other village or town in the county of Bruce. True, it has had its setbacks, such as occurred when the Grand Trunk Railway opened the Owen Sound branch and made that point its principal northern terminus, and again when the sugar refinery failed. Still, it is the busiest town in the county, and the townspeople are hopeful and confident of continued and prolonged prosperity. We trust that these fond hopes may be fully realized.&quot;
* 1949, the Wiarton Red Cross Outpost is replaced with the Wiarton Hospital.

==Geography==
Geographically, the town is defined by the rugged limestone cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment (a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve – one of only twelve such reserves in Canada), which bisects the town. The town rests on the picturesque shores of Colpoys Bay, part of Georgian Bay, which is itself part of Lake Huron, one of the Great Lakes.

The town has long been known as the gateway to the Bruce Peninsula, the peninsula separating Georgian Bay from the rest of Lake Huron.

===Climate===
Wiarton has a warm summer humid continental climate (Dfb under the Koppen Climate Classification) with four distinct seasons. Winters are cold and very snowy with much of it coming from lake effect snow. Because of its location on three sides of water, snowfall totals are very high with an annual average of 404.8 cm. Summers are warm and sunny with a July average of 18.9 degrees Celsius. The average precipitation is 1047.9 mm.

==Economy==

Wiarton&#x27;s most important businesses were initially founded on the lumber industry. The harvest of timber and the manufacture of goods from lumber were an important industry early in the town&#x27;s development, until two widespread forest fires, the first in the late 1800s and the later in the early 1900s, wiped out the local forests.

The next most important industry was fishing. In 1906, Wiarton was awarded a federal fish hatchery, which helped maintain the fish stock in the area for many years. Fishing was at its peak in the early 20th century, but suffered from the introduction of the invasive sea lamprey to the upper Great Lakes through the Welland Canal in 1921. By 1932, the sea lamprey had arrived in Georgian Bay, and, together with the Great Depression, it brought the decline of the fishing industry.

In 1881, the first train arrived in the town as part of Grand Trunk Railway system, for which Wiarton served as its northern terminus, extending to a new wharf in Colpoys Bay constructed in 1882. The last passenger train ran in 1957, when the Canadian government cut back funding on the railways. Freight trains continued using the tracks until 1968, when the lines were abandoned.

Tourism as well as stone mining and finishing are now important economic forces in the town.

==Government==
An elected mayor, deputy major and three councilors provide the municipal government for Wiarton and the many small villages and communities that comprise the Town of South Bruce Peninsula. A number of Committees and local Boards assist Council. &quot;Council establishes policies and budgets for programs and services delivered by the Town of South Bruce Peninsula.&quot; The Legislative Services Department includes the Clerk&#x27;s Division, By-Law Enforcement and Animal Control, and the Building Division.

Wiarton has fire stations, and policing is provided by the Ontario Provincial Police from the Wiarton Detachment.

==Attractions==
Another notable feature is the Wiarton Willie Festival and Wiarton Willie, the albino groundhog who purportedly predicts the length of winter every Groundhog Day. Tourism forms an important part of the town&#x27;s modern economy, attracting many seasonal visitors to the area&#x27;s cottages and resorts, and to the town&#x27;s marina. The Bruce Trail runs through town, with a main trail that is more than 890 km long and side trails of 400 km.

===Other attractions===
*The Grey Bruce Snowmobile Trail runs through Wiarton - access to trails towards Sauble Beach and Tobermory.
*Fishing - Colpoys Bay is a calm bay located on Georgian bay. Every year there are several fish derbies in the area, and large salmon and trout can be fished from the waters of the bay.

===Festivals===
* Wiarton Willie Festival - Groundhog Day
* William Wilfred Campbell Poetry &amp; Arts Festival - June
* Subaru Multi-Sport Race - August
* Wiarton &amp; District Agricultural Fall Fair - Third weekend in September
