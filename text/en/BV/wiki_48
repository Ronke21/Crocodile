<text>Polyphasic sleep is the practice of sleeping during multiple periods over the course of 24 hours, in contrast to monophasic sleep, which is one period of sleep within 24 hours. Biphasic (or diphasic, bifurcated, or bimodal) sleep refers to two periods, while polyphasic usually means more than two. Segmented sleep and divided sleep may refer to polyphasic or biphasic sleep, but may also refer to &quot;interrupted sleep&quot;, where the sleep has one or several shorter periods of wakefulness, as was the norm for night sleep in pre-industrial societies.

A common form of biphasic or polyphasic sleep includes a nap, which is a short period of sleep, typically taken between the hours of 9 am and 9 pm as an adjunct to the usual nocturnal sleep period. Napping behavior during daytime hours is the simplest form of polyphasic sleep, especially when the naps are taken on a daily basis.

The term &quot;polyphasic sleep&quot; was first used in the early 20th century by psychologist J. S. Szymanski, who observed daily fluctuations in activity patterns. It does not imply any particular sleep schedule. The circadian rhythm disorder known as irregular sleep-wake syndrome is an example of polyphasic sleep in humans. Polyphasic sleep is common in many animals, and is believed to be the ancestral sleep state for mammals, although simians are monophasic.

The term &quot;polyphasic sleep&quot; is also used by an online community that experiments with alternative sleeping schedules in an attempt to increase productivity. There is no scientific evidence that this practice is effective or beneficial.
== Biphasic sleep ==
Biphasic sleep (also referred to as segmented sleep, or bimodal sleep) is a pattern of sleep which is divided into two segments, or phases, in a 24-hour period.

=== Single nap (siesta) ===

One classic cultural example of a biphasic sleep pattern is the practice of siesta, which is a nap taken in the early afternoon, often after the midday meal. Such a period of sleep is a common tradition in some countries, particularly those where the weather is warm. The siesta is historically common throughout the Mediterranean and Southern Europe. It is the traditional daytime sleep of China, India, South Africa , Italy, Greece, Spain and, through Spanish influence, the Philippines and many Hispanic American countries. In modern times, fewer Spaniards take a daily siesta, ostensibly due to more demanding work schedules.

=== Historical &quot;first sleep&quot; and &quot;second sleep&quot; ===

A separate biphasic sleep pattern is sometimes described as segmented sleep, involved sleeping in two phases, separated by about an hour of wakefulness. This pattern was common in preindustrial societies, and it was most common to sleep early (&quot;first sleep&quot;), wake around midnight, and return to bed later (&quot;second sleep&quot;). Along with a nap in the day, it has been argued that this is the natural pattern of human sleep in long winter nights. A case has been made that maintaining such a sleep pattern may be important in regulating stress.

Historian A. Roger Ekirch has argued that before the Industrial Revolution, interrupted sleep was dominant in Western civilization. Ekirch asserts that the intervening period of wakefulness was used to pray and reflect, and to interpret dreams, which were more vivid at that hour than upon waking in the morning. This was also a favorite time for scholars and poets to write uninterrupted, whereas still others visited neighbors, engaged in sexual activity, or committed petty crime. He draws evidence from more than 500 references to a segmented sleeping pattern in documents from the ancient, medieval, and modern world. Other historians, such as Craig Koslofsky, have endorsed Ekirch&#x27;s analysis.

Ekirch suggests that it is due to the modern use of electric lighting that most modern humans do not practice interrupted sleep. Some have proposed that a sleep pattern based on the historical biphasic sleep schedule might be beneficial for stress or improve health markers. Ekirch does not advocate for this, stating that the current uninterrupted sleep pattern is the ideal schedule for the modern world.

== Experimental schedules ==

=== Everyman schedule ===

The Everyman schedule involves sleeping 3 hours during the night (&quot;core sleep&quot;), and taking three 20-minute naps during the day. This totals 4 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period.

=== Uberman schedule ===

The Uberman sleep schedule consists of a 30-minute nap every four hours, totaling 3 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period.

Other variations of this sleep pattern involve 8 naps throughout the day, or 20-minute sleep intervals as opposed to 30 minutes.

=== Dymaxion schedule ===
Buckminster Fuller described a regimen consisting of 30-minute naps every six hours. The short article about Fuller&#x27;s nap schedule in &quot;Time&quot; in 1943, which referred to the schedule as &quot;intermittent sleeping&quot;, says that he maintained it for two years, and notes that &quot;he had to quit because his schedule conflicted with that of his business associates, who insisted on sleeping like other men.&quot;

This schedule is likely the most extreme type of polyphasic sleep schedule, totaling only two hours of sleep in a 24-hour period. 

== In extreme situations ==

In crises and other extreme conditions, people may not be able to achieve the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep per day. Systematic napping may be considered necessary in such situations.

Claudio Stampi, as a result of his interest in long-distance solo boat racing, has studied the systematic timing of short naps as a means of ensuring optimal performance in situations where extreme sleep deprivation is inevitable, but he does not advocate ultrashort napping as a lifestyle. &quot;Scientific American Frontiers&quot; (PBS) has reported on Stampi&#x27;s 49-day experiment where a young man napped for a total of three hours per day. It purportedly shows that all stages of sleep were included. Stampi has written about his research in his book &quot;Why We Nap: Evolution, Chronobiology, and Functions of Polyphasic and Ultrashort Sleep&quot; (1992). In 1989 he published results of a field study in the journal &quot;Work &amp; Stress&quot;, concluding that &quot;polyphasic sleep strategies improve prolonged sustained performance&quot; under continuous work situations. In addition, other long-distance solo sailors have documented their techniques for maximizing wake time on the open seas. One account documents the process by which a solo sailor broke his sleep into between six and seven naps per day. The naps would not be placed equiphasically, instead occurring more densely during night hours.

The U.S. military has studied fatigue countermeasures. An Air Force report states:
Similarly, the Canadian Marine pilots in their trainer&#x27;s handbook report that:

NASA, in cooperation with the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, has funded research on napping. Despite NASA recommendations that astronauts sleep eight hours a day when in space, they usually have trouble sleeping eight hours at a stretch, so the agency needs to know about the optimal length, timing and effect of naps. Professor David Dinges of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine led research in a laboratory setting on sleep schedules which combined various amounts of &quot;anchor sleep&quot;, ranging from about four to eight hours in length, with no nap or daily naps of up to 2.5 hours. Longer naps were found to be better, with some cognitive functions benefiting more from napping than others. Vigilance and basic alertness benefited the least while working memory benefited greatly. Naps in the individual subjects&#x27; biological daytime worked well, but naps in their nighttime were followed by much greater sleep inertia lasting up to an hour.

The Italian Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Militare Italiana&quot;) also conducted experiments for their pilots. In schedules involving night shifts and fragmentation of duty periods through the entire day, a sort of polyphasic sleeping schedule was studied. Subjects were to perform two hours of activity followed by four hours of rest (sleep allowed), this was repeated four times throughout the 24-hour day. Subjects adopted a schedule of sleeping only during the final three rest periods in linearly increasing duration. The AMI published findings that &quot;total sleep time was substantially reduced as compared to the usual 7–8 hour monophasic nocturnal sleep&quot; while &quot;maintaining good levels of vigilance as shown by the virtual absence of EEG microsleeps.&quot; EEG microsleeps are measurable and usually unnoticeable bursts of sleep in the brain while a subject appears to be awake. Nocturnal sleepers who sleep poorly may be heavily bombarded with microsleeps during waking hours, limiting focus and attention.

== Physiology ==

The brain exhibits high levels of the pituitary hormone prolactin during the period of nighttime wakefulness, which may contribute to the feeling of peace that many people associate with it.

In his 1992 study &quot;In short photoperiods, human sleep is biphasic&quot;, Thomas Wehr had seven healthy men confined to a room for fourteen hours of darkness daily for a month. At first the participants slept for about eleven hours, presumably making up for their sleep debt. After this the subjects began to sleep much as people in pre-industrial times were claimed to have done. They would sleep for about four hours, wake up for two to three hours, then go back to bed for another four hours. They also took about two hours to fall asleep.

Polyphasic sleep can be caused by irregular sleep-wake syndrome, a rare circadian rhythm sleep disorder which is usually caused by neurological abnormality, head injury or dementia. Much more common examples are the sleep of human infants and of many animals. Elderly humans often have disturbed sleep, including polyphasic sleep.

In their 2006 paper &quot;The Nature of Spontaneous Sleep Across Adulthood&quot;, Campbell and Murphy studied sleep timing and quality in young, middle-aged, and older adults. They found that, in free-running conditions, the average duration of major nighttime sleep was significantly longer in young adults than in the other groups. The paper states further:

<doc id="620331" wikidata="Q2714893" url="?curid=620331" title="Allium tricoccum">
<text>Allium tricoccum (commonly known as ramp, ramps, ramson, wild leek, wood leek, or wild garlic) is a bulbous perennial flowering plant in the amaryllis family Amaryllidaceae. It is a North American species of wild onion or garlic found in eastern North America. Many of the common English names for this plant are also used for other &quot;Allium&quot; species, particularly the similar &quot;Allium ursinum&quot;, which is native to Eurasia. An edible plant, &quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; is used in a variety of North American and indigenous cuisines, and has also been used by Native Americans in traditional medicine. A French rendering (&quot;chicagou&quot;) of a Native American name for this plant is the namesake of the American city of Chicago.

==Description==
&quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; is a perennial growing from an ovoid-conical shaped bulb that is long. Plants typically produce a cluster of 2–6 bulbs that give rise to broad, flat, smooth, light green leaves, that are long including the narrow petioles, often with deep purple or burgundy tints on the lower stems. The bulbs are white and surrounded by brownish to grayish sheathing. Each cluster of bulbs gives rise to one flowering stem. The flowers are arranged into an umbel that has an erect scape that is typically long. The inflorescence has two ovate bracts that enclose the flowers before they open and fall away at anthesis. The flowering stem is persistent after fruiting. The flowering most commonly occurs after the leaves have died back, unlike the similar &quot;Allium ursinum&quot;, in which leaves and flowers can be seen at the same time. Ramps grow in close groups strongly rooted just beneath the surface of the soil. Flowering occurs in June or July into August. The flowers have white, cream or yellowish tepals which are long. The stamens are about as tall as the tepals and the filaments of the stamens have widened bases and are inserted on the corolla. After flowering and fertilization green fruits are produced that are three-lobed and open by way of three valves. The seeds are round, black, and shiny.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; was first named as such in 1789 by the Scottish botanist William Aiton, in &quot;Hortus Kewensis&quot;, a catalog of plants cultivated in London&#x27;s Kew botanic garden. The species had been introduced to Britain in 1770. The specific epithet &quot;tricoccum&quot; refers to the possession of three seeds.

===Varieties===
, Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online accepts two varieties:
* &quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; var. &quot;tricoccum&quot; 
* &quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; var. &quot;burdickii&quot; —narrow-leaf ramps, white ramps, Chicago leek, Burdick&#x27;s leek

This treatment is followed by other sources, although the two taxa are frequently treated as two species, &quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; and Allium burdickii. &quot;A. tricoccum&quot; var. &quot;burdickii&quot; was first described by Clarence Robert Hanes in 1953; the epithet &quot;burdickii&quot; is in honor of Justin Herbert Burdick (1851–1939), a Midwestern physician and manufacturer who pointed out differences between what were then regarded as different &quot;races&quot; in letters to Asa Gray. The variety was raised to a full species by Almut Gitter Jones in 1979.

The two varieties are distinguished by several features. &quot;A. tricoccum&quot; var. &quot;tricoccum&quot; is generally larger than &quot;A. tricoccum&quot; var. &quot;burdickii&quot;: the bulbs are larger, the leaves are usually wide rather than wide and the umbels typically have 30–50 flowers rather than 12–18. Additionally, the leaf stalks (petioles) and leaf sheaths are usually red or purplish in var. &quot;tricoccum&quot; and white in var. &quot;burdickii&quot;. The leaves of var. &quot;burdickii&quot; also have less distinct stalks than those of var. &quot;tricoccum&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is widespread across eastern Canada and the eastern United States.

&quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; var. &quot;tricoccum&quot; is found in woods with rich soils with moist ground in depressions, and along streamside bluffs, and on colluvial slopes. &quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; var. &quot;burdickii&quot; is found growing in dry soils of upland woods.

==Conservation==
In Canada, ramps are considered rare delicacies. Since the growth of ramps is not as widespread there as in Appalachia and because of human activity, ramps are a threatened species in Quebec. &quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; is a protected species under Quebec legislation. A person may have ramps in his or her possession outside the plant&#x27;s natural environment, or may harvest it for the purposes of personal consumption in an annual quantity not exceeding 50 bulbs or 50 plants, provided those activities do not take place in a park within the jurisdiction of the National Parks Act. The protected status also prohibits any commercial transactions of ramps; this prevents restaurants from serving ramps as is done in the United States. Failure to comply with these laws is punishable by a fine. However, the law does not always stop poachers, who find a ready market across the border in Ontario (especially in the Ottawa area), where ramps may be legally harvested and sold.

Ramps are considered a species of &quot;special concern&quot; for conservation in Maine, Rhode Island, and commercially exploited in Tennessee.

==Uses==
&quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; is popular in the cuisines of the rural uplands of its native region. Both the white lower leaf stalks and the broad green leaves are edible. It is regarded as an early spring vegetable with a strong garlic-like odor and a pronounced onion flavor. Ramps also have a growing popularity in restaurants throughout North America.

The plant&#x27;s flavor, a combination of onions and strong garlic, is adaptable to numerous cooking styles. In central Appalachia, ramps are most commonly fried with potatoes in bacon fat or scrambled with eggs and served with bacon, pinto beans and cornbread. Ramps can also be pickled or used in soups and other foods in place of onions and garlic.

=== By Native Americans ===

The Menominee, Cherokee, Iroquois, Potawatomi and Ojibwa all consume the plant in their traditional cuisines.

The Cherokee eat the plant as a spring tonic, for colds and for croup. They also use the warm juice for earaches. The Ojibwa use a decoction as a quick-acting emetic. The Iroquois use a decoction of the root to treat worms in children, and as a spring tonic to &quot;clean you out&quot;. Some Native Americans used juice from the crushed bulbs to treat insect stings.

==In culture==
The city Chicago received its name from a dense growth of ramps near Lake Michigan in Illinois Country observed in the 17th century. The Chicago River was referred to by the plant&#x27;s indigenous name, according to explorer Robert Cavelier, sieur de La Salle, and by his comrade, the naturalist and diarist Henri Joutel. The plant, called &quot;shikaakwa&quot; (&quot;chicagou&quot;) in the Miami-Illinois language spoken by the local indigenous people, was once thought to be &quot;Allium cernuum&quot;, the nodding wild onion, but research in the early 1990s showed the correct plant was the ramp.

The ramp has strong associations with the folklore of the central Appalachian Mountains. Fascination and humor have fixated on the plant&#x27;s extreme pungency. Jim Comstock, editor and co-owner of the &quot;Richwood News Leader&quot;, introduced ramp juice into the printer&#x27;s ink of one issue as a practical joke, invoking the ire of the U.S. Postmaster General.

The inhabitants of Appalachia have long celebrated spring with the arrival of the ramp, believing it to be a tonic capable of warding off many winter ailments. Indeed, ramp&#x27;s vitamin and mineral content did bolster the health of people who went without many green vegetables during the winter.

=== Common name ===
According to West Virginia University botanist Earl L. Core, the widespread use in southern Appalachia of the term &quot;ramps&quot; (as opposed to &quot;wild leek&quot; which is used in some other parts of the United States) derives from Old English:

The name ramps (usually plural) is one of the many dialectical variants of the English word ramson, a common name of the European bear leek (&quot;Allium ursinum&quot;), a broad-leaved species of garlic much cultivated and eaten in salads, a plant related to our American species. The Anglo-Saxon ancestor of ramson was &quot;hramsa&quot;, and &quot;ramson&quot; was the Old English plural, the –n being retained as in oxen, children, etc. The word is cognate with &quot;rams&quot;, in German, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian, and with the Greek &quot;kromuon&quot;, garlic [...] . Wright&#x27;s &quot;English Dialect Dictionary&quot; (1904) lists as variants &quot;rame, ramp, ramps, rams, ramsden, ramsey, ramsh, ramsies, ramsy, rommy&quot;, and &quot;roms&quot;, mostly from northern England and Scotland.

=== Food festivals ===
The community of Richwood, West Virginia, holds the annual &quot;Feast of the Ramson&quot; in April. Sponsored by the National Ramp Association, the &quot;Ramp Feed&quot; (as it is locally known) brings thousands of ramp aficionados from considerable distances to sample foods featuring the plant. During the ramp season (late winter through early spring), restaurants in the town serve a wide variety of foods containing ramps.

The city of Elkins, West Virginia, hosts the &quot;Ramps and Rails Festival&quot; during the last weekend in April of each year. This festival features a cook-off and ramp-eating contests, and is attended by several hundred people each year.

The town of Cosby, Tennessee, bordering Great Smoky Mountains National Park, has held the largest and one of the oldest ramp festivals in the United States, the &quot;Cosby Ramp Festival&quot;, on the first weekend in May since 1954. The festival has played host to as many as 30,000 visitors in years past, has been attended by ex-President Harry Truman, and has featured such notable musical acts as Tennessee Ernie Ford, Eddy Arnold, Roy Acuff, Bill Monroe, Minnie Pearl, and Brenda Lee. Besides the food, heritage music, dancing, and adulation of the ramp, each year a young woman is crowned &quot;Maid of Ramps&quot;.

The community of Flag Pond, Tennessee, hosts its annual Ramp Festival on the second Saturday each May. The festival features a wide variety of ramp-inspired foods, and includes music from an assortment of Appalachian groups. Hundreds of people attend the festival each year.

The community of Whitetop, Virginia, holds its annual ramp festival the third weekend in May. It is sponsored by the Mount Rogers volunteer fire department and features local music from Wayne Henderson and other bands, along with a barbecued chicken feast complete with fried potatoes and ramps and local green beans. A ramp-eating contest is held for children and adults.

An annual ramp convention in Haywood County, North Carolina, has drawn as many as 4,000 participants a year since its inception &quot;circa&quot; 1925.

The community of Huntington, West Virginia, holds an annual ramp festival referred to as Stink Fest. It is hosted by The Wild Ramp, an indoor farmers market.

The Mason-Dixon park in Greene County, Pennsylvania holds an annual ramp festival at the Mason-Dixon Park towards the end of April. There are various ramp delicacies, as well as music, crafts, vendors, and more.

The Mason-Dixon Historical Park in Core, West Virginia offers a Ramp Dinner and Wildflower Walk each spring.

<text>Letterkenny ( , meaning &quot;hillside of the O&#x27;Cannons&quot;), nicknamed the Cathedral Town, is a large town in County Donegal, Ireland, on the River Swilly in the north-west of Ulster. Along with the nearby city of Derry, Letterkenny is a regional economic gateway for the north-west of Ireland.

Letterkenny began as a market town at the start of the 17th century, during the Plantation of Ulster. A castle once stood near where the Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba, County Donegal&#x27;s only Catholic cathedral, stands today. Letterkenny Castle, built in 1625, was located south of Mt Southwell on Castle Street. County Donegal&#x27;s largest third-level institution, Atlantic Technological University (ATU) Letterkenny, is located in the town, as are St Eunan&#x27;s College, Highland Radio, and a Hindu temple. Letterkenny was also the original home of Oatfield Sweet Factory, a confectionery manufacturer; the factory closed and was demolished in 2014. In 1798, Theobald Wolfe Tone was arrested at Laird&#x27;s Hotel in the town. In 2015, Letterkenny was judged as the tidiest town in Ireland.

==Toponymy==
Letterkenny takes its name from the Irish &quot;Leitirceanainn&quot;, meaning &quot;Hillside of the O&#x27;Cannons&quot; – the O&#x27;Cannons being the last of the ancient chieftains of Tír Conaill. While no evidence of forts or castles belonging to the O&#x27;Cannon clan exists in the Letterkenny district, eight miles west of Letterkenny is located Doon Rock, believed by some to be an ancient inauguration site of the O&#x27;Cannon Kings.

The O&#x27;Cannon dynasty is descended from Conn of the Hundred Battles and Niall of the Nine Hostages, two of Ireland&#x27;s ancient High Kings. The O&#x27;Cannons have been described as &#x27;Ancient Princes of Tír Connaill&#x27; and &#x27;Valiant Chiefs&#x27;. Their 350-year dynasty in Tír Connaill ended in 1250. Their ancient territory is recorded as being in Tír Aeda (now the barony of Tirhugh) in what is now South Donegal. After the deaths of Ruairí Ó Canannain (Rory O&#x27;Cannon) and his son Niall Ó Canannain in 1250, the sept declined greatly in power. Brian Ó Néill (Brian O&#x27;Neill) died ten years later in 1260; he had supported an Ó Canannain claimant to Tír Conaill, i.e. to the Kingdom of Tír Conaill (Tirconnell). However, the O&#x27;Cannon Clan remained subservient to the O&#x27;Donnell Clan, the Kings of Tír Chonaill from the early thirteenth century onwards after Gofraid O&#x27;Donnell helped the English defeat the O&#x27;Cannons in 1250. The personal name Canannain is a diminutive of Cano meaning &#x27;wolf cub&#x27;. Canannain was fifth in descent from Flaithbertach mac Loingsig (died 765), high-king of Ireland; they were the descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages (Irish: Niall Noigiallach), who died 405 A.D., by his son Conall Gulban, who gave his name to Tír Conaill, the &#x27;Land of Conall&#x27;, now County Donegal.

By the early 17th century, the name Uí Canannain had been anglicised to O&#x27;Cannon. Further anglicisation took place during the Penal Laws in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the name in Co. Dun na nGall became Cannon. In the early 1880s, there were just 200 families bearing the Cannon surname living in County Donegal, who were mainly tenant farmers. The Cannons/O&#x27;Canannains were of the ancient sept of Cenell Conaill, a branch of the northern Uí Néill and descend from Ruaidrí ua Canannain (died 30 November 950), King of Cenel Conaill, and grandson of Canannain, who flourished in the second half of the 9th century. The site of the ancient seat of the Ó Canannain was near Letterkenny (the largest town of County Donegal only since the 1950s), which is said to represent the countryside of the O&#x27;Cannons (English translation).

==History==

The modern town of Letterkenny began as a market town at the start of the 17th century, during the Plantation of Ulster. It may have been established on the site of an earlier Gaelic settlement. It was the first crossing point of the River Swilly. In the recent past, Letterkenny was a largely agricultural town, surrounded by extensive cattle and sheep grazing on what was then untilled hillside – at a time when Conwal (3 km west of Letterkenny) was the ecclesiastical and seaport centre. The waters of the Atlantic had not yet retreated from the basin of the Swilly, whose estuary at that time extended up almost as far as New Mills – proof of this may be found in those alluvial flatlands between the Oldtown and the Port Road.

Rory O&#x27;Cannon, the last chieftain of the O&#x27;Cannon Clan, was killed in 1248. Godfrey O&#x27;Donnell succeeded Rory O&#x27;Cannon as King of Tír Conaill. He engaged the Norman lord Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly, in battle at Credan in the north of what is now County Sligo in 1257 in which both were badly wounded – Fitzgerald immediately fatally so. Godfrey (also dying from his wounds) retired to a crannóg in Lough Beag (Gartan Lake). O&#x27;Neill of Tír Eoghain — taking advantage of Godfrey&#x27;s fatal illness — demanded submission, hostages and pledges from the Cenél Conaill since they had no strong chieftain since the wounding of Godfrey. Godfrey summoned his forces and led them himself, although he had to be carried on a litter (stretcher). O&#x27;Neill and his men were completely defeated by the Swilly in 1258. Godfrey died however after the battle near where the town of Letterkenny is today. He was buried in Conwal Cemetery. A cross-shaped coffin slab marks his grave to this day.

The receding of the waters of the Atlantic eastwards enabled progress, and with the building of bridges etc., the town of Letterkenny started to take the shape it has today. In the wake of the Plantation of Ulster (which began around 1609), when a area was granted to a Scotsman Patrick Crawford, the compact community formed.

The honour of formally launching the town fell to Sir George Marbury who married Patrick Crawford&#x27;s widow — Crawford having died suddenly while on a return visit to his native Scotland. Initially, there were possibly fifty simple habitations sited where the Oldtown is situated today.

The main streets, though now suffering traffic congestion, were simple pony tracks used by the hill farmers to come to the markets. The markets — started by Patrick Crawford with only a few animals — grew into much busier markets which are not present today.

An ancient castle once stood near where the Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba stands today. Letterkenny Castle, built in 1625, was located south of Mt Southwell on Castle Street. No remains of the castle exist today.

During the Irish Rebellion of 1798, on 12 October, a large French force consisting of 3,000 men, including Wolfe Tone, attempted to land in County Donegal near Lough Swilly. They were intercepted by a large British Royal Navy force, and finally surrendered after a three-hour battle without ever landing in Ireland. After Wolfe Tone was captured he was held for a short time at Laird&#x27;s Hotel (opposite the Market Square) in the Main Street of Letterkenny before being transferred to the nearby Derry Gaol. He was later tried by a court-martial in Dublin and found guilty. His death through suicide occurred in prison.

In 1824, when the first description of Letterkenny as a modern town was written, it was stated that: &quot;Within half a mile is the Port of Ballyraine, whither vessels of 100 tons bring iron, salt and colonial produce and whence they export hides and butter&quot;. Nothing remains now except the warehouses with the example of 19th-century warehouse architecture.

Letterkenny achieved town status in the early 1920s following the partition of Ireland. When the Irish punt replaced the British pound sterling in County Donegal in 1928, many Irish banks that had been previously located in Derry (in the new Northern Ireland) opened branches in Letterkenny.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Climate data for Letterkenny is recorded at Malin Head in the far northern tip of the county. Malin Head&#x27;s climate is classified as Temperate Oceanic (Köppen Cfb) and is significantly milder than some other locations in the world at a similar latitude; this is due to the station&#x27;s position near the Atlantic Coast and exposure to the warmth of the Gulf Stream. Due to its northerly latitude, Malin Head experiences long summer days and short winter days. Summers are cool with temperatures rarely exceeding , while winters are relatively mild with daytime temperatures rarely dropping below . Extreme heat is very rare; however, the town can on occasion receive extreme cold from the Arctic where temperatures drop several degrees below . Snow is relatively uncommon and the station receives on average 20 days of recorded snowfall per year, the vast majority of this occurring between December and March. Humidity is high year-round and rainfall is spread quite evenly throughout the year, with winter months receiving the rainiest days.

===Architecture===

A number of Letterkenny&#x27;s more notable buildings were built in the early 1850s—or earlier. These include educational and ecclesiastical buildings. The town&#x27;s tallest building is the Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba, which was completed in 1901. The cathedral was designed by William Hague from County Cavan. It is built in a light Victorian neo-Gothic version of the French 13th-century Gothic style. Located opposite the cathedral, at the junction of Church Street with Cathedral Square, is Conwal Parish Church, parts of which date from the 17th century.

Another dominant building in the town is St Eunan&#x27;s College. It is a three-storey castellated structure, built in 1904 in the Edwardian variant of the neo-Hiberno-Romanesque style. It has four turreted round towers and flying buttresses which are modelled on the nearby cathedral.

Other architecturally notable buildings can be found at Mount Southwell Terrace, which is located at the top of Market Square, just off Castle Street. This Georgian-style terrace of red brick was built in 1837 by Lord Southwell. The terrace contains five Georgian houses and served as a holiday home for Maud Gonne when she stayed here while holidaying in Donegal. St Conal&#x27;s Hospital is a large Victorian neo-Georgian structure located on the Kilmacrennan Road in the town. While the oldest parts of the building date from the 1860s, the hospital&#x27;s chapel was built in the neo-Norman style in the 1930s.

The Donegal County Museum is housed in the old workhouse on High Road which was completed in May 1843.

In later years, Letterkenny has seen more modern architectural developments. The new Letterkenny Town Council offices, known locally as &quot;The Grasshouse&quot;, were designed by Donegal-based MacGabhann Architects. It features a sloping grass roof situated above a broad band of aluka matt cladding and a runway-like ramp to the first-floor concourse. A 2002 article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reportedly described it as a &quot;building of international interest&quot;. The town council had previously been based in a house known as &quot;Murrac-a-Boo&quot;, off the Port Road, which was badly damaged in a fire in 2004 and subsequently demolished.

==Demographics==

Letterkenny is the largest town in County Donegal. Despite having a long tradition of emigration that continued until the early 1990s, Letterkenny has since had net immigration. The recent immigrants include people from Central Europe, Africa, and Asia. This is reflected in the recent growth of immigrant restaurants and shops, including Chinese and Indian restaurants, as well as specialised shops run by and providing goods for Africans, Asians, South Americans, and Central Europeans. Letterkenny is home to one of Ireland&#x27;s few Hindu temples.

The figures for the ethnic and cultural background of people in the state in 2006 revealed that 16% of Letterkenny&#x27;s population are non-nationals. The figures also show that most of Donegal&#x27;s non-national population live in the town. Of the town&#x27;s total population, 2,709 are non-nationals. According to the 2006 census 4,957 people have a disability illness, 640 people have a registered disability, 537 have a chronic illness while 345 suffer from a psychological or an emotional condition. The 2006 census also revealed that there were 199 travellers living within the town&#x27;s environs.

==Education==

Primary and secondary education in the town is organised similarly to the rest of Ireland. There are 5 primary schools in Letterkenny, including Scoil Colmcille and Woodland School, while there are 4 secondary schools.

Of the four secondary schools, the most noteworthy is St Eunan&#x27;s College — a day school and former boarding school located on Sentry Hill close to the Glencar district of Letterkenny, just northwest of its centre. The College, as it is known locally to distinguish it from the cathedral and GAA club, is named after Adomnán or Eunan (the Abbot of Iona who was native to Tír Chonaill, mainly modern County Donegal, and is patron saint of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raphoe).

Coláiste Ailigh is a Gaelcholáiste (a secondary school with the stated purpose of providing education through the Irish language). It opened in 2000. The Loreto Convent Secondary School, adjacent to St Eunan&#x27;s Cathedral, is more than 150 years old.

The ATU Donegal Letterkenny (formally Letterkenny Institute of Technology) (LYIT; known locally as &quot;The Regional&quot; and &quot;The IT&quot;), which is situated east of the town centre on the Port Road, is a training centre for technicians, offering courses in engineering, information technology, materials science, design, business and nursing. The institute is one of the smaller places of third level education in the historic province of Ulster, with a lower student intake than other colleges such as Belfast Metropolitan College and the regional colleges of the North West, South, South East and South West, all of which themselves are smaller than the universities in Northern Ireland - Queen&#x27;s University Belfast and Ulster University.

==Economy==
Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce and Industry was founded in 1965. It is the only Donegal Chamber of Commerce affiliated to Chambers Ireland, meaning it &quot;provides input into national and regional lobbying policies&quot;, according to its website.

In February 2020, the &quot;Donegal News&quot; reported that the &quot;number of vacant commercial properties in Letterkenny had risen by 8.7 per cent by the end of [the previous year], meaning that out of 720 recorded commercial premises in the town, 134 are vacant&quot;.

===Retail===
The retail trade in Letterkenny includes modern shopping centres and family-owned local shops – often providing handmade crafts.

Many High Street stores operate in Letterkenny. The town is the northwest region&#x27;s major shopping centre and helps to serve outlying areas including rural County Donegal and Derry. The three main shopping malls are the Courtyard Shopping Centre, the Letterkenny Retail Park and the Letterkenny Shopping Centre, the latter being the oldest. Built in 1984, it is the largest shopping centre in County Donegal, and was the first of several such complexes in Letterkenny. While originally built on the outskirts of the town, urban expansion means it now lies in the town proper. Letterkenny has been identified as one of Europe&#x27;s fastest-growing towns by business owners. The centre remained largely unchanged until 2004, when the centre was expanded, and new lighting, flooring and decor were added. More retail units were constructed along with the expansion of the Tesco outlet and thus becoming &quot;one of the Major developments in Ireland&quot;. These centres feature numerous international and Irish chains such as Tesco, Penney&#x27;s (Primark) and others. There are also many other small centres such as the &quot;Glencar Shopping Centre&quot; and the &quot;Market Centre&quot;.

Previously, Letterkenny&#x27;s Main Street served as the main shopping area in the town but trade has now shifted further afield expanding the town in the process. The Main Street is home to many older establishments including R. McCullagh Jewellers (dating from 1869), Magees Pharmacy (dating from 1928) and Ernest Speer Clothing Store. Newer shopping areas in the town include the Letterkenny Retail Parks on &quot;Pearse Road&quot; and &quot;Canal Lane&quot;. Smaller streets such as &quot;Church Street&quot; and &quot;Castle Street&quot; have grown in recent years with businesses such as bakeries, pharmacies and fashion outlets having been opened. The &quot;Market Square&quot; has also attracted fresh business.

In August 2012, two winning Lotto tickets using the same numbers for the same draw were bought at two different locations in the town – Mac&#x27;s Mace on the High Road and The Paper Post on Main Street. The occurrence made national news. A spokesperson for Lotto HQ in Dublin said it was the first time this had happened.

===Industry===
In April 1970, the &quot;Donegal News&quot; reported that local politicians acknowledged &quot;a very real problem&quot; in attracting industrialists to come to the town, even in spite of grants being available to do so.

The town&#x27;s major employers include the Letterkenny University Hospital, Pramerica, Optum Health Care and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the latter having decentralised to the town in 1990, following a government decision to relocate 200 civil service jobs from Dublin.

Letterkenny is at the centre of industry in the northwest of Ireland. Eircom, Boston Scientific and UnitedHealth Group (Optum) are significant employers in the region. As the main commercial centre of north Donegal, Letterkenny also has a host of financial service institutions, legal firms and small businesses.

Pramerica was established in Letterkenny in 2000. It was a business and technology operations subsidiary of U.S.-based Prudential Financial Inc. (NYSE: Pru)and grew to over 2,000 employees before being taken over by Tata Consultancy Services in 2020. Prudential still retains some staff on site as PGIM.

There has been a significant decline in the manufacturing base, while employment has grown in the service sector. Since 2002 there has been a significant expansion in the retail sector. Allied to this growth has been the development of the cultural infrastructure. This includes the opening of An Grianán Theatre and the development of a new arts centre.

Letterkenny was also home of the confectionery manufacturers Oatfield. It was based at the entrance to Ballyraine, near the town&#x27;s central area. The factory was demolished in the summer of 2014. Rockhill Barracks was once a major contributor to the local economy but closed in January 2009 due to military cuts. The Rambling Man distillery was located at the Eastend until 1976, and was not named after its owner Stephen Rambling.

The economy in the town is strongly dependent on cross-border trade, and economic growth is dependent somewhat on the currency exchange rate between the Euro and the British Pound. 

===Media===
Letterkenny receives all of the national television stations on the Saorview DTT platform from the local Letterkenny transmitter. Due to its close proximity to Derry City and Strabane in Northern Ireland, the town and its surrounding areas have been able to receive overspill analogue television signals from the Derry City transmitter since December 1957 and the Strabane transmitter since February 1963. The town can also receive satellite services and broadband television services too.

The regional radio station is Highland Radio which broadcasts from the town to north, east and west County Donegal, West Tyrone and the City of Derry. It began broadcasting in 1990.

Letterkenny is home to several media companies. The main regional newspaper in the town and county is the &quot;Donegal Democrat&quot; (owned by the &quot;Derry Journal&quot;), whose offices also print two other titles every week – the &quot;Donegal People&#x27;s Press&quot; on Tuesday and also &quot;Donegal on Sunday&quot;. Another local paper is the &quot;Derry People/Donegal News&quot; (popularly known locally as the &quot;Derry People&quot;). It is distributed on a Friday, as well as having a Monday edition. The Milford-based &quot;Tirconaill Tribune&quot;, printed in Letterkenny, is distributed throughout the county. The town also produces two freesheet newspapers, the &quot;Letterkenny People&quot; (previously the &quot;Letterkenny Listener&quot;), which is distributed on a Thursday, and the &quot;Letterkenny Post&quot;, which is printed on a Thursday night for Friday circulation. The &quot;Derry Journal&quot;, based in Derry itself, is also a major newspaper in the town and its environs.

===Local government===

Letterkenny became an urban district in 1899 under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. This became a town council in 2002. In common with all town councils, it was abolished in 2014.

In November 2012, Letterkenny Town Council passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in Phil Hogan, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who had proposed the abolition of town councils. In November 2013, they planned to protest Hogan&#x27;s visit to the town to officially open a new wastewater treatment works at Magherenan but then decided against out of respect for those involved in the project - Mayor Paschal Blake and Deputy Mayor Tom Crossan attended to pass comment against Hogan in their speech.

In 2008, Letterkenny represented Ireland in the Entente Florale, having scooped Gold in the Large Urban Centre category of the 2007 National Tidy Town Awards. Locally there was a minor furore as all flags of competing nations were displayed in prominent areas of the town, with some difficulty encountered when locals discovered the controversial Union Jack flag hanging from a pole adjacent to the library and Paddy Delap&#x27;s newsagent. The flag is still upsetting to many people angered by continuing British rule in Northern Ireland and as such led to an intensely heated debate on local radio station Highland Radio on the day the judges were in town. The flag was first mounted the previous day (7 August) and had to be taken down when some concerns were raised about its safety on a busy Thursday night. It was remounted the following day. Nevertheless, the town won gold in the competition.

Letterkenny is a local electoral area in County Donegal, and returns five councillors to Donegal County Council. With the 3-seat LEA of Milford, it forms the municipal district of Letterkenny–Milford.

===National government===
Until the 2016 general election, Letterkenny was part of the Donegal North-East constituency. In 2016, it became part of the county-wide five-seat Donegal constituency.

===Policing and crime===
Crime rates vary widely across different areas of Letterkenny. Recorded crime has been rising in Letterkenny, notably violent crime and fraud, while links with Romanian criminals are also evident.

==Culture==
===Literature===
A niece of Jane Austen, daughter of her brother Edward, is buried in the town alongside her husband Lord George Hill. Two other nieces, also daughters of Edward, are buried just outside the town, close to Ballyarr.

===Leisure and amusement===
Annual events of note include the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade in March and Earagail Arts Festival in June/July.

An Grianán Theatre, is the largest theatre in County Donegal with a seating capacity of 383, and provides live performances.

Letterkenny Regional Cultural Centre, located behind An Grianán Theatre, opened on 9 July 2007.

Letterkenny hosted the annual Irish traditional music festival, the Fleadh Cheoil, for consecutive years (2005 and 2006). Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann organised both festivals. Letterkenny has also hosted the international Pan Celtic Festival for consecutive years (2006 and 2007). Celts from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Isle of Man, Brittany and Cornwall visited Letterkenny for the &quot;craic agus ceoil&quot;. Along with the daily street performances on Market Square, An Grianán Theatre and The Courtyard Shopping Centre, song, fiddle, harp and dance contests are also featured.

Century Cinemas, located on Canal Lane, is an eight-screen cinema complex.

The La Scala Cinema was formerly located in Letterkenny. Brendan Behan, while holidaying in County Donegal on Tuesday 22 August 1961, walked there to watch Eamonn Andrews interviewing him in the newsreel &quot;Meet the Quare Fella&quot;. According to the &quot;Derry People&quot;, Behan chose a balcony seat and sang along with his onscreen self, &quot;the first duet sung by one person in Letterkenny&quot;. Behan had previously visited the town in early June 1960 and attended the Rainbow Bar, where (reported a newspaper) &quot;he regaled those fortunate enough to be present with some typical outspoken comments on affairs of the present&quot;.

Letterkenny is a favoured nightlife location for the local catchment area, and also for the rest of Ulster — particularly at weekends and especially for visitors from the nearby city of Derry. The Main Street — originally the retail centre of Letterkenny — has become a centre for nightclubs and pubs, boosted by the remnants of its old shopping district.

Letterkenny is also the namesake of the fictional town of Letterkenny, Ontario, the setting of the Canadian television show also called &quot;Letterkenny.&quot; There is also a small locality elsewhere in Ontario named Letterkenny, now in the township of Brudenell, Lyndoch and Raglan.

==Notable people==
==Sport==

Letterkenny has a modern community purpose-built leisure and sports complex, comprising a swimming pool, football pitches (both natural grass and astroturf), and sports halls. Gaelic football, rugby and soccer are the most popular sports in the town, but many other minority sports are practised also, such as hurling, boxing, kickboxing, golf, swimming and gymnastics.

===Association football===
Letterkenny Rovers F.C. plays its home games at Leckview Park, at Canal Road, in the town. Bonagee United are another local team and play their home games at Dry Arch Park and Glencar Celtic F.C is another team from the town who play in the Donegal League. There also are a number of schoolboy soccer clubs within the town&#x27;s environs and an annual league is played at Under 12, Under 14 and Under 16 age groups.

The closest professional football club is League of Ireland Premier Division side Finn Harps in Ballybofey, 12 miles from Letterkenny.

Former Arthurlie F.C. professional football player Denis McLaughlin is from Letterkenny. Former professional footballers Paul Scholes and Rory Delap also have ties to Letterkenny, as does Shane Duffy. Delap and Duffy often visit.

===Gaelic football===
Letterkenny has two Gaelic games clubs: St Eunan&#x27;s and Letterkenny Gaels, who play their home games at O&#x27;Donnell Park and at Páirc na nGael in The Glebe, respectively. St Eunan&#x27;s is one of Donegal&#x27;s most successful clubs and has won various County and Ulster championships at underage level, as well as successes at the senior level since the turn of the 21st century. The Letterkenny Gaels club was formed in 1996. Letterkenny Gaels provide football, ladies&#x27; football, hurling and Scór activities to the people of the town and surrounding areas. The club currently plays in the Donegal Junior Championship. The Letterkenny Gaels club, which shares its facilities with Letterkenny Rugby Club, was promoted to Division 2 of the All-County League in 2021.

===Rugby football===
Rugby football is played locally at various levels, from school to senior league level. Letterkenny RFC, which was founded in 1973, is the largest rugby club in the town. It has forged links with several New Zealand rugby fraternities due to the fact that Dave Gallaher, the first captain of the All Blacks, was born in Ramelton, a village eight miles (13 km) from Letterkenny. The club&#x27;s rugby ground in Letterkenny was named the Dave Gallaher Memorial Park in his honour in November 2005 by a visiting contingent of All Black players, led by captain Tana Umaga.

===Other sports===
Letterkenny has two men&#x27;s basketball teams, Letterkenny Heat and Letterkenny IT, as well as a junior basketball club, Letterkenny Blaze. Letterkenny Golf Club is located just outside the town centre. There are also pitch and putt and tennis facilities in the town. Letterkenny Sports Complex, a state-of-the-art leisure centre complete with a skate park, is located on the edge of the town. Letterkenny Athletic Club is also located in the town. The town also hosts the Donegal International Rally on the third weekend of June every year and the Donegal Harvest Rally every October. There is a campaign being run by a local councillor for the construction of a horse racing track and facilities on land at the Big Isle, on the outskirts of the town.

In 2014, the Donegal Marathon was relaunched in the town after a 30-year absence. More than 800 participated in the 2014 race which was won by Benny Mullan.

Annual events of note include the North West 10K (May), St Eunan&#x27;s College 5K (May/April), Donegal International Rally (June), Gartan Triathlon (June/July) and Donegal Harvest Rally (October).

==Transport==
===Air===
The nearest airport is City of Derry Airport, which is located about to the east at Eglinton. Donegal Airport (locally known as Carrickfinn Airport) is less than an hour away, located to the west in The Rosses. The closest main international airport to Letterkenny is Belfast International Airport (also known as Aldergrove Airport), located at Aldergrove in County Antrim.

Letterkenny has a small privately operated airfield situated on the outskirts of the town which is operational; it has both hard and grass of 620 metres, hangars available for overnight guests, ICAO EILT. There is also a small private airfield at Finn Valley approx 8 miles away. It is run and operated by the Finn Valley Flying Club. The airstrip is 700 metres of grass; it is mainly for use by ultralights and light aircraft. The airfield is home to a number of ultralights, and the flying club run an open weekend each August. The airfield is only suitable for small private aircraft and ultralights, with no commercial traffic whatsoever. It is approximately 8 miles from the town.

===Rail===

The town was, in times past, connected with the once extensive 3ft (914mm) narrow-gauge rail network of County Donegal. The two railway companies that served Letterkenny were the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway. This provided connections to Derry (and through there to Dublin and Belfast), to Lifford and Strabane, to Gweedore and Burtonport, and to Carndonagh, north of Derry. The rail system was built in the late 19th century, with the last extensions opening in the 20th century. Some of these lines were never profitable, built using then UK government subsidies. Only a couple of decades later, the independence of the Irish Free State from the rest of the UK resulted in rail companies operating across two jurisdictions where there had previously been one. This had devastating effects on an already fragile economic situation, resulting eventually in the final closure of all parts of the rail system in the area by December 1959.

Today, the closest railway station to County Donegal is Derry~Londonderry railway station in the nearby City of Derry. This station is owned and run by NI Railways (N.I.R.) and runs via Coleraine to Belfast Lanyon Place railway station and Belfast Grand Central station. The strategically important Belfast-Derry railway line is to be upgraded to facilitate more frequent trains and improvements to the permanent way such as track and signalling to enable faster services.

In July 2023, a draft report published by the Department of Transport and Department for Infrastructure recommended a new 160 km/h (100 mph) dual-tracked electrified line between Portadown and Derry, and a new single-track line between Derry and Letterkenny. The draft also recommends a direct rail service from Letterkenny to Dublin and Belfast. The report proposed a possible construction timeframe of between 2030 and 2050.

In November 2024, Northern Ireland&#x27;s Translink began a feasibility study into reopening the Derry-Portadown railway line.

In January 2025, Declan Meehan, a Donegal County Councillor for the Letterkenny-Milford MD, put forward a motion for the Council to seek funding for a feasibility study into a railway line between Letterkenny and Derry, to coincide with Translink&#x27;s study. Additionally, the motion called for a delegation from Donegal County Council to meet the incoming Government and Minister for Transport to lobby for rail re-opening to be accelerated in the county. The motion was passed.
===Bus===
Bus Éireann operates multiple daily services from Letterkenny bus station to Ireland&#x27;s larger urban areas like Dublin (number 32), Derry and Galway (both number 64). Private coach companies operate daily services to and from town. The Lough Swilly Bus Company (known locally as &quot;Lough Swilly&quot; or &quot;the Swilly Bus&quot;) operated a local transport service until they ceased trading in April 2014. Bus Éireann is now the main bus service provider in the town. 

Letterkenny is also connected to other parts of the county via TFI Local Link. Routes include Route 271 to Burtonport, Route 264 to Ballyshannon, Route 300 to Fanad, Route 953 to Moville and Route 989 to Carrigans.

Private companies provide daily bus services to Derry and Belfast. Letterkenny has no cross-border public transport service linking it directly to Belfast.

===Road===
Two national primary roads serve the town: the N13 from the South (Stranorlar) and the N14 from the east (Lifford). The N13 also links into the A2 road (Northern Ireland) to Derry. The N56 secondary road, beginning at the N14 in the town, travels in a loop around the county, ending in Donegal town. Regional roads include the R245, connecting Letterkenny northward to the Fanad and Rosguill peninsulas, and the R250 southwest to Glenties and Churchill.

===Taxi===
Taxi services are available from a rank on Main Street at Market Square.

==Environment==
===Tidy Towns===

Letterkenny has a long history in Ireland&#x27;s national Tidy Towns competition, first entering in 1959 and achieving its best result in 2015.

In 2002, a National Anti-Litter League survey carried out by An Taisce compared Letterkenny&#x27;s excess litter to that normally associated with The Liberties, a litter blackspot located in Dublin&#x27;s impoverished inner city. It was voted &quot;Best Kept Urban Centre&quot; in the 2007 &#x27;Best Kept Town Awards&#x27; and took top prize in the &quot;Large Urban Centre&quot; category at the 2007 Tidy Towns competition. It appeared to maintain its litter-free status for the remainder of that decade, judging by the results of a study by business group Irish Business Against Litter, published on 23 August 2010.

In 2011, it was named its county&#x27;s tidiest town, receiving 306 points, four less than the overall winner Killarney. This included 47/50 points for its landscaping, the highest number of points scored by any town in this category. Out of the 821 entrants in the 2011 competition, Letterkenny finished in eighth place and received a gold medal for a ninth consecutive year. In the 2012 competition, it was selected as the tidiest town in the north-west of the country. In 2013, it was selected as one of Ireland&#x27;s top ten towns.

In 2015, Letterkenny achieved its best result in the Tidy Towns competition, being awarded top prize in the &quot;Large Urban Centre&quot; category and receiving the overall award as Ireland&#x27;s tidiest, Ireland&#x27;s best. Letterkenny received the same points total in 2016 but this was not sufficient to retain the title.

===Air quality===
In December 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cited Letterkenny as having higher levels of air pollution than the Indian capital New Delhi. Professor John Wenger said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been looking at figured from the EPA for the last few years and it&#x27;s the highest I&#x27;ve seen. It is quite extraordinary&quot;. Just over two months later, the &quot;Donegal News&quot; reported that the latest EPA graphs showed levels were &quot;still off the charts&quot;; more than 200 micrograms per cubic metre of fine particulate matter at times during February 2020, &quot;when the recommended annual mean limit set by the World Health Organisation for PM2.5 is just 10 micrograms per cubic metre&quot;, while levels of sulphur dioxide in Letterkenny surpassed 200 μg/m3 &quot;even though levels are not supposed to exceed 125 μg/m3 in 24 hours in the interest of the &#x27;protection of human health&#x27;&quot;.

===Water quality===
Water quality in Letterkenny is a persistent problem. &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; lists Donegal, in which Letterkenny is located, as one of its Irish counties in which visitors should not drink the tap water due to its featuring &quot;toxic chemicals&quot;. In March 2020, the &quot;Donegal News&quot; reported on the concerns of residents in Letterkenny that their water supply was blue in colour and/or reeked of chlorine. The report also stated that these features of the water were less noticeable while running a tap but much more noticeable when filling a bath.

The European Commission has stated that Ireland has, since 2003, been in breach of a directive against high levels of Trihalomethane (THM) in its water. The Commission stated that large amounts of THM cause diseases of the liver, kidneys and central nervous system, cancers of the bladder and colon, and damages to foetuses during pregnancy. The highest levels of THM were recorded in County Donegal (in which Letterkenny is located), as well as in Counties Cork, Kerry and Wicklow.

<doc id="620340" wikidata="Q6570187" url="?curid=620340" title="List of English words of Irish origin">
<text>This is a list of English-language words from the Irish language with links provided to pronunciation in all three primarily Irish dialects, spoken by native Irish speakers, provided by Foras na Gaeilge.

==B==
;banshee (from Irish &quot;bainsídhe/beansídhe&quot;, meaning &quot;woman of fairy&quot; or &quot;of a fairy mound&quot;):&quot;Bean&quot; (ban) is the Modern Irish word for &quot;woman.&quot; (modern spelling &quot;sí&quot;) is Irish for &#x27;mound&#x27; (see Sidhe). In traditional Irish mythology, a spirit usually taking the form of a woman who sings a caoineadh (lament) warning of impending death in an old Irish family.
;bog (from &quot;boc&quot;, meaning &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;marshy&quot; and &quot;-aigh&quot; to form bogach meaning &quot;soft soil composed primarily of peat&quot;): Used as the Anglicized &quot;bog&quot; as slang for a mire, but also to become stuck or impeded; &quot;bog&quot; has also been borrowed into English with essentially the same meaning as &quot;bogach&quot;.
;bogeyman (possibly from &quot;&quot; + English &quot;&quot;): The word bogaigh is pronounced approximately as &quot;boggy&quot;, and the bogeyman legend originates from humanoid-appearing logs and human &quot;bog-bodies&quot; found well-preserved in peat. These occasional discoveries gave rise to unsettling stories some suggest may have been used to encourage good behavior from otherwise misbehaving children.
;boreen (from &quot;bóithrín&quot;, meaning &quot;country lane&quot;): A narrow, rural Irish road.
;bother (possibly from &quot;&quot;, &quot;deaf; bothered; confused&quot;; or from &quot;bodhraigh&quot;, &quot;to deafen; to annoy&quot;): The earliest use appears in the writings of Irish authors Sheridan, Swift and Sterne.
;brock (from old Irish &quot;brocc&quot;): A badger.
;brat (from Old Irish &quot;bratt&quot; meaning &quot;cloak, mantle&quot;): A cloak covering or cloth. Also as swadding-clothes and bird&#x27;s plumage.
;brogan (from &quot;bróg&quot;, meaning &quot;shoe&quot; or &quot;boot&quot;.): A boot or shoe of untanned leather, often with holes in the sides or over the toes intended for drying while worn in wet conditions.
;brogue (from &quot;barróg&quot;, meaning &quot;to wrestle or grasp&quot; with teanga (tongue) to mean an impediment of speech.): Though found in wide use in English to indicate a heavy accent, the Irish do not use this term for the negative connotations.

==C==
;, : (from &quot;clábar&quot;) wet clay or mud; curdled milk.
;clock: O.Ir. meaning &quot;bell&quot;; into Old High German as &quot;glocka, klocka&quot; (whence Modern German &quot;Glocke&quot;) and back into English via Flemish; cf also Welsh &quot;cloch&quot; but the giving language is Old Irish via the hand-bells used by early Irish missionaries.
;colleen: (from &quot;cailín&quot; meaning &quot;young woman&quot;) a girl (usually referring to an Irish girl) (OED).
;corrie: a cirque or mountain lake, of glacial origin. (OED) Irish or Scots Gaelic &quot;coire&quot; &#x27;Cauldron, hollow&#x27;
;craic: fun, used in Ireland for fun/enjoyment. The word is actually English in origin; it entered into Irish from the English &quot;crack&quot; via Ulster Scots. The Gaelicised spelling &quot;craic&quot; was then reborrowed into English. The &quot;craic&quot; spelling, although preferred by many Irish people, has garnered some criticism as a &quot;faux&quot;-Irish word.
;cross: The ultimate source of this word is Latin &quot;crux&quot;, the Roman gibbet which became a symbol of Christianity. Some sources say the English wordform comes from Old Irish &quot;cros&quot;. Other sources say the English comes from Old French &quot;crois&quot; and others say it comes from Old Norse &quot;kross&quot;.

==D==
;drum (ridge), drumlin: (from &quot;drom/druim&quot; meaning &quot;ridge&quot;) a ridge often separating two long narrow valleys; a long narrow ridge of drift or diluvial formation. &quot;Drumlin&quot; is a linguistic diminutive of &quot;drum&quot;, and it means a small rounded hill of glacial formation, often seen in series (OED). A landscape of many drumlins occurs in some parts of Ireland, including counties Cavan and Armagh. &quot;Drumlin&quot; is an established technical word in geology, but &quot;drum&quot; is almost never used.
;drisheen: (from &quot;drisín&quot; or &quot;drúishin&quot;).
;dulse: (from Old Irish &quot;duilesc&quot;).

==E==
;esker: (from &quot;eiscir&quot; meaning a particular kind of ridge) an elongated mound of post-glacial gravel, usually along a river valley (OED). In English usually used as a strictly-defined term in geology.

==F==
;Fenian: (from &quot;Fianna&quot; meaning &quot;semi-independent warrior band&quot;) a member of a 19th-century Irish nationalist group (OED).
;fiacre: a small four-wheeled carriage for hire, a hackney-coach. Saint Fiacre was a seventh-century Irish-born saint who lived in France for most of his life. The English word &quot;fiacre&quot; comes from French. (OED)

==G==
;Gallowglass: (from &quot;gallóglach&quot;) a Scottish Gaelic mercenary soldier in Ireland between mid 13th and late 16th centuries.
;: (from &quot;go leor&quot; meaning &quot;til plenty&quot;) a lot (OED).
;gob: (literally &quot;beak&quot;) mouth, though used in colloquial Irish more often to refer to a &#x27;beaky&#x27; nose, i.e. a sticky-beak. Perhaps from Irish. (OED)
;: (from &quot;griscín&quot;) a lean cut of meat from the loin of a pig.

==H==
;hooligan: (from the Irish family name &quot;Ó hUallacháin&quot;, anglicised as &quot;O&#x27;Houlihan&quot;) one who takes part in rowdy behaviour and vandalism.

==K==
;keening: (from &quot;caoinim&quot; meaning &quot;I wail&quot;) to lament, to wail mournfully (OED). No relation to &quot;keen&quot; = eager.
;, : to finish, to put an end to: &quot;That&#x27;s put the kibosh on it&quot;. The OED says the origin is obscure and possibly Yiddish. Other sources suggest that it may be from the Irish meaning &quot;the cap of death&quot; (a reference to the &quot;black cap&quot; worn by a judge passing sentence of capital punishment, or perhaps to the gruesome method of execution called pitchcapping); or else somehow connected with &quot;bosh&quot;, from Turkish &quot;boş&quot; (empty). (Caip bháis – pronounced as kibosh – is also a word in Irish for a candle-snuffer.)

==L==
;Leprechaun: (from &quot;leipreachán&quot;, based on Old Irish luchorpán, from lu &#x27;small&#x27; + corp &#x27;body&#x27;) (OED).
;Limerick: (from &quot;Luimneach&quot;)
;lough: (from &quot;loch&quot;) a lake, or arm of the sea. According to the OED, the spelling &quot;lough&quot; was originally a separate word with a similar meaning but different pronunciation, perhaps from Old Northumbrian: this word became obsolete, effectively from the 16th century, but in Anglo-Irish its spelling was retained for the word newly borrowed from Irish.

==P==
;: (probably from the English meaning &quot;gilt brass ring used by swindlers&quot;, which is from Irish meaning &quot;ring&quot;) fake.
;poteen: (from &quot;póitín&quot;) hooch, bootleg alcoholic drink (OED)

<doc id="620342" wikidata="Q3629885" url="?curid=620342" title="Manohar Joshi">
<text>Manohar Gajanan Joshi (2 December 1937 – 23 February 2024) was an Indian politician from the state of Maharashtra, who served as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra from 1995 to 1999, and Speaker of the Lok Sabha from 2002 to 2004. He was one of the prominent leaders of the Shiv Sena, and also one of the Indians to be elected to all of the four legislatures. He was posthumously awarded the Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s third-highest civilian honour, by the Government of India in 2025.

==Early life==
Joshi was born on 2 December 1937 in the Marathi-speaking Brahmin family of Gajanan Krishna Joshi and Saraswati Gajanan in Nandavi of Raigad district in Maharashtra. He received his Masters of Arts and LLB degrees from Mumbai University. He married Anagha Joshi on 14 May 1964, with whom he had a son, Unmesh, and two daughters, Asmita and Namrata. His granddaughter, Sharvari Wagh, made her debut as an actress with the 2021 film &quot;Bunty Aur Babli 2&quot;.

== Formation of Kohinoor ==

After receiving his MA in law he joined Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as an officer, but later started the Kohinoor technical/vocational training institute with the idea of an institute for semi–skilled youths to offer training as electricians, plumbers, TV/radio/scooter repairmen and photographers. Eventually, he started multiple branches of Kohinoor in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, etc., and later he made an entry into construction and another capital-oriented business.

Manohar Joshi also founded the Kohinoor Business School &amp; Kohinoor-IMI School of Hospitality Management in Khandala, Maharashtra. Later on he took Chancellorship of Dnyaneshwar Vidyapeeth.

== Political career ==

=== Early years ===
Joshi began his career by being elected as a municipal councillor in Bombay Municipal Corporation in 1968 from the Shiv Sena.

In 1972 Joshi was elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Council, where he served three terms until 1989. He became the Mayor of Mumbai during 1976 to 1977. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly from a Shiv Sena ticket in 1990.
=== Chief Minister ===
Joshi became the first non-Congress Chief Minister of Maharashtra when the Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition came to power in 1995. Technically, Sharad Pawar led the first non-Congress government in Maharashtra in 1978 as a member of Socialist Indian National Congress.

=== Controversy and resignation ===
Joshi and Bal Thackeray were explicitly named for inciting the Shivsainiks to violence against Muslims during the 1992–1993 riots in an inquiry ordered by the government of India, the Srikrishna Commission Report. However, Joshi, then a part of the BJP-Sena government called the report &quot;anti-Hindu, pro-Muslim and biased&quot; and refused to adopt the commission&#x27;s recommendations.

As Chief Minister, he had permitted the release of a plot of land in Pune, reserved for a school, to a builder with ties to his son-in-law, Girish Vyas. A housing complex, named Sundew, was built on that land by Vyas in 1998. Sustained legal efforts by Vijay Kumbhar, an RTI activist from Pune, led to Joshi&#x27;s resignation in January 1999. In March 2009, Bombay High Court passed a verdict calling the housing complex illegal. The Supreme Court of India upheld the verdict in 2011 and fined Joshi Rs 15,000. Following its order, the building is now being used for a school.

=== Lok Sabha and Speaker ===
Joshi was promoted to the Lok Sabha when he won in Central Mumbai in the 1999 General Elections. He was the Speaker of the Lok Sabha from 2002 to 2004 during the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) administration.

Joshi was elected for a six-year term to the Rajya Sabha on 20 March 2006 after being defeated in the previous Lok Sabha election in the Central Mumbai constituency.

=== National Legislator Conference ===
In September 2022, Manohar Joshi was appointed a key patron of NLC Bharat.

==Death==
Manohar Joshi died in Mumbai on 23 February 2024, at the age of 86. He had suffered a cardiac arrest a day earlier and been placed in Hinduja hospital&#x27;s intensive care unit, dying the next day of age-related health complications.

<doc id="620343" wikidata="Q1809448" url="?curid=620343" title="Whole Foods Market">
<text>Whole Foods Market, Inc. (colloquially referred to as simply Whole Foods) is an American multinational supermarket chain headquartered in Austin, Texas, which sells products free from hydrogenated fats and artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. A USDA Certified Organic grocer in the United States, the chain is popularly known for its organic selections.

John Mackey, the last remaining co-founder of Whole Foods Market, sold the company to Amazon for $13.7 billion on August 28, 2017. , Whole Foods has more than 500 stores in North America and seven in the United Kingdom.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
In 1978, John Mackey and Renee Lawson borrowed $45,000 from family and friends to open a small vegetarian natural foods store called SaferWay in Austin, Texas (the name being a spoof of Safeway). When the two were evicted for storing food products in their apartment, they decided to live at the store. Because it was zoned for commercial use, there was no shower stall, so they bathed using a water hose attached to their dishwasher.

Two years later, Mackey and Lawson partnered with Craig Weller and Mark Skiles to merge SaferWay with the latter&#x27;s Clarksville Natural Grocery, resulting in the opening of the original Whole Foods Market, which included meat products. At and with a staff of 19, the store was large in comparison to the standard health food store of the time.

On May 25, 1981, the most damaging flood in 100 years devastated Austin. Whole Foods&#x27; inventory was ruined, and most of the equipment was damaged. The loss was approximately $400,000, and Whole Foods Market had no insurance. Customers, neighbors, and staff assisted in repairing and cleaning up the damage. Creditors, vendors, and investors assisted in the recovery, and the store reopened 28 days later.

=== Expansion ===


Beginning in 1984, Whole Foods Market expanded from Austin, first to Houston and Dallas and then to New Orleans with the purchase of The Whole Food Co. in 1988. In 1989, the company expanded to the West Coast with a store in Palo Alto, California.

The company made its initial public offering on January 23, 1992. The company&#x27;s ticker symbol on the Nasdaq was WFM.

While opening new stores, the company fueled rapid growth by acquiring other natural foods chains throughout the 1990s: Wellspring Grocery of North Carolina, Bread &amp; Circus of Massachusetts and Rhode Island (banner retired in 2003), Mrs. Gooch&#x27;s Natural Foods Markets of Los Angeles, Bread of Life of Northern California, Fresh Fields Markets on the East Coast and in the Midwest, Bread of Life of Florida, Detroit-area Merchant of Vino stores, and Nature&#x27;s Heartland of Boston. The company purchased Allegro Coffee Company in 1997. The company&#x27;s 100th store was opened in Torrance, California, in 1999.

The company started its third decade with additional acquisitions. The first was Natural Abilities in 2000, which did business as Food for Thought in Northern California. After the departure of then company president Chris Hitt and regional president Rich Cundiff, Southern California region, John Mackey promoted A. C. Gallo, president of the Northeast region, and Walter Robb, president of the Northern California region to co-COO and soon after added the titles of co-president. This led to the promotion of three new regional presidents and a new era for the company. David Lannon became president of the Northeast region, Anthony Gilmore became president of the Southwest region, and Ron Megehan became the Northern California region, president. In 2001, Whole Foods also moved into Manhattan. Later that year, Ken Meyer became president of the newly formed South region and Whole Foods Market acquired the assets of Harry&#x27;s Farmers Market, which included three stores in Atlanta. In 2002, the company continued its expansion in North America and opened its first store in Toronto, Ontario. Further continuing its expansion, Select Fish of Seattle was acquired in 2003.

In late 2004, it was reported that Whole Foods had &quot;cleared $188 million in profits in the last two years.&quot;

In 2005, Whole Foods opened its flagship store in downtown Austin. The company&#x27;s headquarters moved into offices above the store.

Whole Foods opened its first store in Hawaii in 2008 and in 2008 it also opened a southeast distribution center in Braselton, Georgia, calling it the first &quot;green distribution center&quot; for the company.

Along with new acquisitions, such as the 2014 purchase of seven Dominick&#x27;s Finer Foods locations in Chicago, Whole Foods has also sold stores to other companies. For example, 35 Henry&#x27;s Farmers Market and Sun Harvest Market stores were sold to a subsidiary of Los Angeles grocer Smart &amp; Final Inc. for $166 million in 2007.

Whole Foods opened its second store in western New York in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo in September 2017.

As part of a streamlining campaign, in January 2017, the company reported that it would close three remaining regional kitchens in Everett, Landover and Atlanta.

In June 2017, Amazon purchased Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion. Amazon plans for Whole Foods customers who also have an Amazon Prime account to be able to order groceries online and then pick them up in store for free.

In January 2019, to facilitate expansion into previously unserved areas, Amazon announced plans to acquire some former Sears and Kmart locations from Sears Holdings, which filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection on October 15, 2018. These vacant locations would be demolished or remodeled to create new Whole Foods Market locations.

In April 2019, Whole Foods opened its largest store in the Southeast in Midtown Atlanta. The three-level store has a burger restaurant, an Allegro Coffee shop, and a rooftop terrace.

==== International expansion ====

Whole Foods entered the Canadian market in 2002 in Toronto. In 2013, Whole Foods said it would open around 40 more stores in Canada over time. At the time, there were 9 Whole Foods in Canada. By January 2017, Whole Foods had 467 stores, all of which were in the United States except 9 in the United Kingdom and 12 in Canada. In January 2017, Whole Foods announced it was canceling plans from 2015 and 2016 to open stores in Calgary and Edmonton. Among the twelve were five each in Greater Vancouver and Greater Toronto, and one each in Ottawa and Victoria. In March 2020 there were 487 stores in the US, 14 in Canada and 7 in the UK.

In 2004, Whole Foods Market entered the UK by acquiring seven Fresh &amp; Wild stores. In June 2007, it opened its first full-size store, a total of on three levels, on the site of the old Barkers department store on Kensington High Street, West London and currently their largest store in the world. Company executives claimed that as many as forty stores might eventually be opened throughout the UK. However, by September 2008, in the wake of Whole Foods Market&#x27;s financial troubles, Fresh &amp; Wild had been reduced to four stores, all in London. The flagship Bristol branch closed because it had &quot;not met profitability goals.&quot; In the year to September 28, 2008, the UK subsidiary lost £36 million due to a large impairment charge of £27 million and poor trading results due to the growing fears of a global recession. However, in 2011, global sales grew +8% each financial quarter as shoppers returned to the chain. A first Scottish store was opened on November 16, 2011, in Giffnock, Glasgow, which was closed in November 2017 along with the company&#x27;s Cheltenham store as part of a rationalization plan. Whole Foods Market Inc. currently operates five different Whole Foods locations: in Camden Town, Clapham Junction, Kensington, Piccadilly Circus and Stoke Newington.

==== Acquisition of Wild Oats Markets and antitrust complaint ====
On February 21, 2007, Whole Foods Market, Inc. and Wild Oats Markets Inc. announced the signing of a merger agreement under which Whole Foods Market, Inc. would acquire Wild Oats Markets Inc.&#x27;s outstanding common stock in a cash tender offer of $18.50 per share, or approximately $565 million based on fully diluted shares. Under the agreement, Whole Foods Market, Inc. would also assume Wild Oats Markets Inc.&#x27;s net debt totaling approximately $106 million as reported on September 30, 2006.

On June 27, 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an administrative complaint challenging Whole Foods Market, Inc.&#x27;s acquisition of Wild Oats Markets Inc. According to the complaint, the FTC believed that the proposed transaction would violate federal antitrust laws by eliminating the substantial competition between two close competitors in the operation of premium natural and organic supermarkets nationwide. The FTC contended that if the transaction were to proceed, Whole Foods Market would have the ability to raise prices and reduce quality and services. Both Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats stated their intention to oppose the FTC&#x27;s complaint vigorously, and a court hearing on the issue was scheduled for July 31 and August 1, 2007. CEO John Mackey started a blog on the subject to explain his opposition to the FTC&#x27;s stance. Further blogging by Mackey was revealed when the FTC released papers detailing highly opinionated comments under the pseudonym &quot;Rahodeb&quot; that he made to the Whole Foods Yahoo! investment message board. This became the subject of an investigation when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted that the Regulation Fair Disclosure law of 2000 may have been violated. The SEC cleared Mackey of the charges on April 25, 2008.

On July 29, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the district court&#x27;s decision to allow the merger. The Court of Appeals ruled that &quot;premium natural, and organic supermarkets&quot; (&quot;PNOS&quot;), such as Whole Foods and Wild Oats, constitute a distinct submarket of all grocers. The court ruled that &quot;mission-driven&quot; consumers (those with an emphasis on social and environmental responsibility) would be adversely affected by the merger because substantial evidence by the FTC showed that Whole Foods intended to raise prices after the consummation of the merger. As part of its effort to combat the ruling, Whole Foods subpoenaed financial records, market studies, and future strategic plans belonging to New Seasons Market, a regional competitor based in the Portland area. In 2009, Whole Foods agreed to sell the Wild Oats chain.

=== 2017–present: Amazon subsidiary ===
In February 2017, Whole Foods said it would close nine stores and lowered its financial projections for the year as the natural-foods company struggled with increased competition and slowing sales growth. In late April 2017, Whole Foods reported their sixth consecutive quarter of declining sales and announced that the company would be closing nine stores: two each in Colorado and California, and one each in Georgia, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and Illinois. The loss of revenue was attributed to foot traffic being down and other supermarkets offering a similar experience for a lower cost.

In June 2017, Amazon announced it would acquire Whole Foods Market, adding some 400 physical stores to Amazon&#x27;s e-commerce assets. The purchase was valued at $13.7 billion and caused Whole Foods&#x27;s stock price to soar after the announcement was made.

In 2018, Whole Foods announced its possible intention to take over some vacant Sears and Kmart stores and refurbish them after Sears Holdings Corporation, which owned both chains, filed for bankruptcy in October.

In April 2022, Whole Foods in Austin, Texas, began allowing consumers to make purchases by scanning their palms. The system uses the Amazon One system connected to a customer&#x27;s debit or credit card.

In September 2022, John Mackey stepped down from his position as chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, one he held since its inception in 1980. Jason Buechel succeeded him. Buechel previously was executive vice president and chief information officer (CIO) between 2013 and 2019, followed by a tenure as chief operating officer (COO) from 2019 until his promotion in 2022.

In March 2024, Whole Foods announced they will close their Fulham and Richmond stores in UK, as well as their distribution center in Dartford. The Amazon-owned supermarket also announced that they have signed a lease for a new store on King’s Road in London’s Chelsea, expected to open its doors in 2025.

In January 2025 workers at a Whole Foods Market in Philadelphia voted to become the first unionized store in the grocery chain, hoping that a union could help negotiate higher wages and better benefits. Whole Foods said it was “disappointed” by the unionization. In February 2025, Whole Foods asked the National Labor Relations Board to reject the results of the union election, making unspecified allegations that the election was invalid.

== Product quality ==
Whole Foods Market sells only products that meet its self-created quality standards for being &quot;natural,&quot; which the store defines as minimally processed foods that are free of hydrogenated fats as well as artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, preservatives, and many others as listed on their online &quot;Unacceptable Food Ingredients&quot; list. Whole Foods has also announced that it does not intend to sell meat or milk from cloned animals or their offspring, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled them safe to eat.

The company also sells many USDA-certified organic foods and products that aim to be environmentally friendly and ecologically responsible. Stores do not carry foie gras or eggs from hens confined to battery cages due to animal cruelty concerns as a result of successful advocacy by animal welfare groups. The Whole Foods website details the company&#x27;s criteria for selling food, dietary supplements, and personal care products.

Until June 2011, body care products sold at Whole Foods could be marketed as organic even if they contained ingredients not listed by the USDA as acceptable for use in organic food. &quot;Products made using petroleum-derived and other synthetic or chemical ingredients, prohibited in organic foods, can be found among the organic shampoos and lotions made by Avalon, Nature&#x27;s Gate, Jason Natural Cosmetics, Kiss My Face and other brands,&quot; said Urvashi Rangan, an environmental health scientist at Consumer Reports. This is because the federal guidelines that regulate organic food labeling do not apply to cosmetics. Starting in June 2011, personal care products sold at Whole Foods Market were required to follow the same USDA National Organic Program standards for organic food. This required products labeled &quot;Organic&quot; to contain 95 percent or more certified organic ingredients.

In a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article in August 2009, John Mackey acknowledged that his company had lost touch with its natural food roots and would attempt to reconnect with the idea that health was affected by the quality of food consumed. He said, &quot;We sell a bunch of junk.&quot; He stated that the company would focus more on health education in its stores. As of 2013, many stores have employed Healthy Eating Specialists who are team members who &quot;answer customers&#x27; healthy eating questions and can assist ... in choosing the most nutrient-dense ingredients, suggest satisfying healthy recipes,&quot; and help &quot;create a meal plan in keeping with your health goals.&quot;

== Rating systems ==

Whole Foods Market has developed several in-store rating systems for various departments to allow their customers full transparency in purchasing. The Seafood department has a Sustainability Rating System for wild-caught seafood while farm-raised seafood has to meet aquaculture standards both rated in accordance to third-party auditors. The Meat department has a rating system in partnership with the Global Animal Partnership based on animal welfare. The produce department has a rating system based on farming practices which include measures of a farm&#x27;s environment, GMO transparency, worker safety, and wage practices. The grocery department has an Eco-scale rating system for its cleaning products which measures their environmental impact. Each system is in place to allow customers to make the most educated choices within Whole Foods Market. There are efforts to create more rating systems in other departments.

== GMO product labeling ==
Whole Foods Market has announced plans to provide its customers GMO (genetically modified organism) product labeling by 2018. Efforts of GMO transparency run the gamut of each department. For years, Non-GMO Project Verified items have been sought in Grocery. While efforts continue in Produce, Whole Foods recommends buying organic or referring to their &quot;Responsibly Grown produce rating system [which] requires growers to disclose the use of GMO seeds or plant material.&quot; In Seafood, plans are being made to launch a Non-GMO Project Verification process for farm-raised fish. Currently, there are no USDA Organic regulations for farmed seafood.

== Purchasing ==

Whole Foods Market purchases products for retail sale from local, regional, and international wholesale suppliers and vendors. Most purchasing occurs at the regional and national levels to negotiate volume discounts with major vendors and distributors. Regional and store buyers focus on local products and any unique products necessary to ensure a neighborhood market feel. Whole Foods says that the company is committed to buying from local producers that meet its quality standards while also increasingly focusing more of their purchasing on producer- and manufacture-direct programs. Some regions have an employee known as a &quot;forager,&quot; whose sole duty is to source local products for each store.

=== Whole Trade Guarantee ===
In April 2007, Whole Foods Market launched the Whole Trade Guarantee, a purchasing initiative emphasizing ethics and social responsibility concerning products imported from the developing world. The criteria include fair prices for crops, environmentally sound practices, better wages and labor conditions for workers, and the stipulation that one percent of proceeds from Whole Trade-certified products go to the Whole Planet Foundation to support micro-loan programs in developing countries. The company&#x27;s goal, published in 2007, is to have at least half of its imported products from these countries fully certified by 2017.

== Efforts ==
Whole Foods Market has a policy of donating at least five percent of its annual net profits to charitable causes. Some of this mandate is accomplished through store-level donations held on certain &quot;5% days&quot; throughout the year. The rest of it comes from various targeted projects by the company.

=== Environmental involvement ===
In May 1999, Whole Foods Market joined the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a global independent, not-for-profit organization promoting sustainable fisheries and responsible fishing practices worldwide to help preserve fish stocks for future generations. The company first began selling MSC-certified seafood in 2000, and a growing selection of MSC-certified fish continues to be available.

Whole Foods placed third on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 Green Power Partners&quot;. The company also received the EPA Green Power Award in 2004 and 2005 and the Partner of the Year award in 2006 and 2007. A January 8, 2007, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report listed Whole Foods Market as the second-highest purchaser of green power nationwide, citing its actions as helping drive the development of new renewable energy sources for the electricity generation. The EPA report showed Whole Foods Market using 463.1 million kilowatt hours annually. It was covered, 100 percent net-wise, by its total electricity from biomass, geothermal, small hydro, solar, and wind sources.

In August 2024, Whole Foods dairy suppliers were planning a pilot program with Windfall Bio, a startup company with financing from the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Mayfield, and others, to add microbes to the soil of their farms that consume methane emissions to produce fertilizer.

=== Energy ===
Whole Foods Market claims several energy efficient initiatives on the store website, including installing electric vehicle charging stations, harnessing solar energy, achieving green building certificates, using green refrigeration, and designing grocery stores of the future.

In 2006 Whole Foods Market was amongst the first retailers, and the first Fortune 500 company, to offset 100% of their emissions by purchasing Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). Skepticism surrounding this purchase and RECs as a whole have been prevalent online. Harvard Business Review writes that “the money paid to purchase those RECs, in theory, subsidizes the higher cost of producing clean electricity, making this alternative competitive, or creates a market mechanism that will cause more renewables to be produced.” The energy produced by wind farms that are benefactors of RECs is distributed to the same power grid as energy from fossil fuels, making the success of RECs difficult to track and quantify. Energy policy researcher Michael Gillenwater states that “claims that the U.S. green power market result in additional wind power lack credibility.” A 2022 study found that the purchasing of RECs inflates the actual value of this environmental commodity in terms of limiting emissions.

Whole Foods Market also has several stores that function entirely on UTC power fuel cells on-site. One of the company&#x27;s Mississippi locations plans on utilizing a local wind farm funded by Amazon to source the store’s energy needs. In the case study of a Raleigh, North Carolina Whole Foods Market, the company worked with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Commercial Building Partnerships to plan and evaluate the construction of an extremely energy-efficient building, which if successful, would have been rolled out to other locations. Whole Foods Market is also working with the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s GreenChill program to reduce refrigerant emissions. Refrigeration is extremely energy-intensive, leading the company to start using a refrigerant with a 68% lower global warming potential than the most commonly used refrigerants.

Whole Foods signed an agreement with SolarCity to install solar panels on up to 100 stores. In 2015 the company was named in the top 25 companies by number of solar installations. Whole Foods also reduced their energy usage by 21% between 2010 and 2021.

Whole Foods Market extends their energy initiatives globally. The company’s non-profit organization, Whole Planet, which aims to alleviate poverty also pertains to climate mitigation. In 2023 the company announced that they would fund the distribution of solar home kits across Sierra Leone, making energy more accessible with a Pay-as-you-Go model.

=== Eliminating plastic ===
In January 2008, Whole Foods Market was the first U.S. supermarket to commit to eliminating disposable plastic grocery bags to help protect the environment and conserve resources, and many stores serve as a collection point for shoppers to recycle their plastic bags.

On Earth Day, April 22, 2008, the chain eliminated the use of disposable plastic grocery bags company-wide at point-of-purchase in favor of reusable bags or paper bags made from recycled paper. The company also began offering &quot;Better Bags,&quot; large, colorful grocery bags made primarily from recycled bottles. The move from the traditional paper/plastic system to reusable bags has been packaged as an initiative the company calls &quot;BYOB – Bring Your Own Bag.&quot; The campaign is aimed at reducing pollution by eliminating plastic bags and reducing waste by encouraging bag reuse with &quot;bag refunds&quot; of 5–10 cents, depending on the store.

However, it still offers single-use plastic bags in its produce department and does little to discourage persistent use by customers and Amazon Prime Now shoppers alike.

=== Treatment of animals ===
Whole Foods created the Animal Compassion Foundation in January 2005 to help other producers evolve their practices to raise animals naturally and humanely. On December 5, 2014, the organization registration was canceled. In 2008, Whole Foods created the Global Animal Partnership (G.A.P.) and says that &quot;all fresh beef, pork, chicken, turkey and lamb (except kosher turkey and chicken) must be certified to meet 100+ animal welfare standards&quot; set by the organization.

Whole Foods announced in June 2006 that it would stop selling live lobsters and crabs, but in February 2007, made an exception for a Portland, Maine, store for its ability to meet &quot;humane standards.&quot; The lobsters are kept in private compartments instead of being piled on top of one another in a tank, and employees use a device that gives them a 120-volt shock so that they are not boiled alive in a pot of water. This decision was criticized by ex-lobsterman Trevor Corson as damaging a New England tradition and as removing people&#x27;s connection to where their food comes from. In 2022, Whole Foods said it would temporarily stop selling Maine lobsters due to sustainability issues and a possible risk to whales.

In May 2014, Whole Foods launched a pilot program to sell rabbit meat in 5 of its 12 market regions. Because domestic rabbits are the eighth most common pet in the United States as well as an animal rescued and sheltered alongside cats and dogs, this decision triggered a nationwide boycott of Whole Foods by the vegetarian activist House Rabbit Society and their supporters. In June 2014 Whole Foods awarded a financial grant to Oz Family Farms, a family-owned rabbit meat business.

In January 2015, a group of activists organized under the network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) released a video of laying hens from a Northern California farm that supplies eggs to Whole Foods. In the video, which featured footage of crowded, dirty henhouses and injured birds, DxE contended that the hens&#x27; welfare was severely compromised, even though numerous boards had labeled the farm as &quot;Certified Humane.&quot;

In 2015, animal rights groups People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and DxE released investigations criticizing Whole Foods animal welfare standards and accusing Whole Foods suppliers of animal cruelty. After the release of its investigation, PETA joined other animal welfare organizations in a letter to Whole Foods, writing that &quot;Under the guise of compassion, Whole Foods is profiting from violence against animals.&quot; PETA co-founder Ingrid Newkirk also criticized Whole Foods&#x27; animal welfare, arguing that supposed welfare failures indicate a need for animal rights rather than welfare. Whole Foods has come under harsh criticism from abolitionist vegans such as Gary L. Francione who view the company&#x27;s policies as a betrayal of the animal rights position.

In 2015, during a PETA investigation of Whole Foods pork supplier Sweet Stem Farm LLC, in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, video showed pigs living in a dark structure, not allowed access to the outdoors. Some animals were shown lifted by their ears, lying sick or injured, and hauled away dead. In a statement, Whole Foods cited a commitment to their G.A.P. program and, after visiting the supplier, &quot;did not see the issues PETA alleged.&quot;

Another Whole Foods supplier, Plainville Farms, was suspended from the G.A.P. program following the release of a video from a 2021 PETA investigation, showing turkeys being kicked, stomped and thrown by workers at Pennsylvania farms. Law enforcement charged twelve men with 141 counts of animal cruelty, including six felonies, which marks the largest number of animal cruelty charges in a U.S. factory farm case. Plainville said it would cooperate with the investigation, but PETA said the company was not doing enough to keep the public informed about how turkeys are raised. Two of the men charged pleaded guilty and were sentenced in 2023.

Also in 2023, PETA called on Whole Foods to stop selling coconut milk from Thailand. The protest campaign followed a multi-year investigation, where PETA revealed that monkeys in Thailand are forced to climb tall trees for hours and to pick coconuts used to produce products such as milk, flour and oil. In November 2022, PETA released video showing monkeys chained to trees and forced to pick coconuts and workers beating some of them. The Thai Embassy subsequently reported that more than 25,000 retailers worldwide had since stopped carrying coconut milk from Thailand.

=== Toxins ===
In January 2004, in California, the Environmental Working Group and the Center for Environmental Health presented a notice of intent to file an anti-toxin lawsuit against salmon producers. This was in large part due to Whole Foods&#x27; involvement, including highlighting the company&#x27;s failure to warn consumers the fish contained potentially dangerous levels of cancer-causing chemicals known as PCBs.

In February 2006, shareholders of Whole Foods filed a resolution asking Whole Foods to report toxic chemicals found in its products. Substances such as Bisphenol A (BPA), found in products such as baby bottles and children&#x27;s cups, are controversial. Whole Foods no longer sells baby bottles and children&#x27;s cups made with BPA.

# In the wake of concern over the safety of seafood imports from China, on July 10, 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Whole Foods imports a small amount of frozen shrimp from China, accounting for less than 2% of the company&#x27;s total seafood sales. A Whole Foods spokesperson addressed the issue, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re not concerned about the less than 2 percent. It&#x27;s business as usual for us.&quot;

== Criticism and controversies ==

Whole Foods Market is considered anti-labor by most worker organizations, and it has been criticized that its products may not be as progressive as they are touted to be. Author Michael Pollan has contended that the supermarket chain has done well in expanding the organic market but has done so at the cost of local foods, regional producers, and distributors. Parts of the debate have taken place publicly through a series of letters between Pollan and Whole Foods CEO John Mackey.

Ronnie Cummins, national director of the United States Organic Consumers Association, opined that &quot;Whole Foods Market now is a big-box retailer – and it&#x27;s much more concerned about competing with the other big boxes than issues of ethics and sustainability.&quot; Similarly, researcher Stacy Mitchell of the New Rules Project argues that the corporation&#x27;s aggressive marketing of local food is more hype than substance.

Whole Foods has frequently been the subject of resistance or boycotts in response to proposed store locations. The corporation has also been criticized for its aggressive policy of promoting its own in-house brands (e.g., 365) at the expense of smaller or local independent brands.

On August 11, 2009, Whole Foods co-founder and CEO John Mackey published an editorial in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticizing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; the editorial was controversial in the natural foods community. On December 24, 2009, Mackey resigned from the position of chairman of the board of the company, a position he held since 1978. On his blog, he wrote, &quot;John Elstrott will now take the title of Chairman of the Board, which will accurately reflect the authority and the responsibilities that he has had for many years.&quot; Mackey remains a member of the board of directors as of 2012. Whole Foods&#x27;s current CEO is Jason Buechel. 

The company has created other controversies at various times involving business practices, labor issues, product selection, and failure to support farmers and suppliers. In March 2013, Whole Foods promised to label GMO-containing products in North American stores by 2018. The company has drawn criticism for questionable science behind the claims of benefit of its products, including encouraging and selling drugs that are described to work under homeopathic principles.

In 2013, two workers in Albuquerque, New Mexico, were suspended for speaking Spanish. The resulting investigation revealed that Whole Foods has a policy of speaking &quot;English to customers and other Team Members while on the clock&quot;. The company soon revised this policy.

In 2014, Whole Foods agreed to pay an $800,000 settlement in response to allegations that its California stores were charging more per weight than what its labels indicated. The company continued this practice despite the settlement, with investigators alleging thousands of continued violations well into 2015. In 2015, the CEOs made a public admission of the practice happening in New York after a New York City Department of Consumer Affairs investigation.

Whole Foods has faced other lawsuits in California over the presence of carcinogens. In March 2008, following a study by the Organic Consumers Association, reports of high levels of 1,4-Dioxane found in body care products at Whole Foods prompted the Attorney General of California to file a lawsuit against the company for a violation of Proposition 65. Civil penalties of up to $2,500 a day were expected to be awarded. The action claimed that 365, along with brands sold by other cosmetic companies, did not include a label warning about the chemical; spokesperson Libba Letton stated that the company did &quot;not believe that these products represent a health risk or are in excess of California&#x27;s Proposition 65 Safe Harbor level for 1,4-Dioxane&quot; while consumer activist David Steinman urged them &quot;to stop treating the inclusion of cancer-causing chemicals in their products as &#x27;business as usual.&#x27;&quot; Proposition 65 was invoked again in 2013 when the state again sued Whole Foods, and other retailers over the presence of lead in certain candies.

In January 2016, SJ Collins Enterprises, a developer who often works with Whole Foods, petitioned the Sarasota County board of county commissioners to allow the removal of a five-acre protected wetlands so that they could build a surface parking lot for a planned Whole Foods shopping center and Wawa gas station at the intersection of University Parkway and Honore Avenue. The county commission voted 4–1 to allow the re-zoning and accept 41 acres of replacement wetlands. The lone commissioner voting against the proposal, Charles Hines, stated that approval of the petition could create a domino effect leading to the destruction of other protected areas.

In June 2016, US food safety inspectors warned the company that violations discovered at Whole Foods&#x27; Everett, Massachusetts, plant could result in food being &quot;contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health.&quot;

In April 2018, Whole Foods Market faced social media backlash over the opening of the third location of the independent restaurant chain, &quot;Yellow Fever,&quot; in a Whole Foods 365 store in Long Beach, California, for possible racist undertones.

In April 2020, &quot;Business Insider&quot; revealed extensive monitoring of stores to identify and target unionization, using a metric based on racial diversity, employee loyalty, turnover and more.
In June 2020, two employees said they were sent home for wearing masks that stated &quot;I can&#x27;t breathe&quot; and &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;. A Whole Foods spokesperson stated that &quot;all Whole Foods Market Team Members have signed acknowledgments of our longstanding company dress code, which prohibits any visible slogans, messages, logos or advertising that are not company-related, on any article of clothing, including face masks&quot;.

In November 2020, Whole Foods banned Canadian employees from wearing a Remembrance Day poppy, the national symbol of remembrance worn by Canadians on Remembrance Day. On November 6, 2020, the House of Commons of Canada unanimously adopted a motion &quot;to condemn Whole Foods and its owner Jeff Bezos for banning its employees from wearing poppies on their uniform&quot;. The same day, Whole Foods reversed its policy, saying &quot;Given the learnings of today, we are welcoming Team Members to wear the poppy pin in honour of Remembrance Day.&quot;

Whole Foods has been criticized for &quot;humanewashing&quot;, or misleading animal welfare labeling, on its meat, dairy, and egg products. In 2024, international farmed animal protection organization Mercy For Animals accused Whole Foods of humanewashing and lacking transparency regarding the company&#x27;s plans for fulfilling its pledge to stop sourcing fast-growing broiler chicken breeds, also known as &quot;Frankenchickens&quot;, by 2024. Whole Foods&#x27; 2023 impact report states that higher-welfare breeds constituted only 4.42% of fresh chicken units sold in 2023, just one year before the company&#x27;s commitment deadline for reaching 100%. Despite continuing to tout its pledge, Whole Foods has yet to add a time-bound plan for implementing its breed policy to its public chicken welfare roadmap.

== Awards and recognition ==
Whole Foods Market was included in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual list of the &quot;100 Best Companies to Work For&quot; yearly from the list&#x27;s inception in 1998 to being placed number 44 in 2014. The chain has also won a number of awards for social responsibility including a first-place ranking by Harris Interactive / The Wall Street Journal in 2006 and British trade magazine &quot;The Grocer&quot; named it the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Food Retailer&quot; the same year. It has received past spots on the &quot;100 Best Corporate Citizens&quot; list published by &quot;Corporate Responsibility Officer&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Supermarket News&quot; ranked Whole Foods number 19 on its list of &quot;Top 75 North American Retailers.&quot;

== Labor relations and anti-union activism ==
Among its core values, the company lists &quot;supporting team member happiness and excellence.&quot; The company maintains that its treatment of workers obviates the need for labor unions: At its U.S. stores, after 800 service hours, full-time workers are given an option to purchase health insurance coverage starting at $20 per paycheck for themselves, and spouse and dependent coverage for an additional charge. 

Whole Foods&#x27; health insurance plan is notable for its high deductibles – $2000 for general medical expenses and $1000 for prescriptions. However, employees receive $300 to $1800 per year (depending on years of service) in personal wellness funds. Once an employee has met the deductibles, insurance covers 80% of general medical costs and prescriptions but not for any type of mental illness. CEO Mackey drew attention to the insurance program (offered through United Health Care in the US) for its employees in an op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. In the article he called his company&#x27;s insurance plan a viable alternative to &quot;Obamacare&quot;. Mackey summed up his antipathy toward universal coverage in his op-ed by stating:

A careful reading of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution will not reveal any intrinsic right to health care, food, or shelter. That&#x27;s because there isn&#x27;t any. This &quot;right&quot; has never existed in America.

A &quot;Boycott Whole Foods&quot; page on Facebook was created in response to John Mackey&#x27;s position on health care.

Mackey, a libertarian, believes that unions facilitate an adversarial relationship between management and labor. An attempt at unionizing in Madison, Wisconsin, in 2002 was met with resistance from store management, and Labor activists accused whole Foods of union busting. Employees at the Madison store voted in favor of unionization. Whole Foods then refused to bargain with its employees. After a year, the company moved to decertify the union. Further attempts at unionizing Whole Foods Market stores have been unsuccessful. Whole Foods launched a nationwide campaign, requiring workers to attend &quot;Union Awareness Training,&quot; complete with PowerPoint presentations.

Whole Foods was criticized for its refusal to support a campaign by the United Farm Workers (UFW) on behalf of agricultural workers laboring on strawberry farms. During the late 1990s, the UFW persuaded several supermarket chains to sign a pledge in support of improved wages and working conditions for strawberry pickers. Whole Foods chose instead to support the farm workers indirectly by holding a &quot;National 5% Day&quot; where five percent of that day&#x27;s sales – $125,000 – was donated to organizations that provide social services to farmworkers.

In September 2015, Whole Foods announced layoffs of 1,500 jobs, 1.6 percent of its workforce, to lower prices. Over the next two months, the eliminated jobs would come from regional and store positions.

Whole Foods hired the Labor Relations Consulting or &quot;union busting&quot; company Kulture Consulting, LLC on May 23, 2016. This was in response to a union election at a Whole Foods distribution center in Florida. A member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) wrote that Kulture&#x27;s CEO and founder Peter List had &quot;in his effort to &#x27;persuade&#x27; workers...engaged in &#x27;patently unlawful&#x27; activities&quot; during a 2007 organizing campaign.

In September 2019, Whole Foods announced it would cut the health benefits of part-time workers, affecting 2% of the workforce or 1,900 employees.

== Management system ==

=== Employee structure and culture ===
Whole Foods Market consists of twelve geographic regions, each with its own president, regional administrative team, store-level leadership, and store-level team members. A 4-tier hierarchy of employment exists within the Whole Foods Company: Store Employment, Facilities Employment, Regional Offices, and Global Headquarters.

=== Employee benefits and incentives ===
To help employees learn about products, the company has instituted a mentoring program and developed an online portal called &quot;Whole Foods Market University&quot; to aid in training. Internal parlance refers to &quot;team leaders&quot; instead of &quot;managers,&quot; and stores sometimes offer prizes for competing teams. A 2014 analysis of 2012 figures found that Whole Foods Market was &quot;among the least generous companies&quot; in terms of its 401(k) savings program.

Whole Foods Market has an employee discount; while all employees are provided a standard base discount rate of 20% on all store purchases, higher rates, up to 30%, can be earned based on employee physical fitness health tests that are given yearly. These fitness exams are taken at the option of the employee.

=== Company structure ===
Whole Foods Market is composed of seventeen companies, each specializing in a different product. In the 1990s, while new stores were being opened, other natural food chain stores were being acquired for horizontal integration. This led to the Federal Trade Commission challenging the eventual merger with Wild Oats on the basis that it violated antitrust laws, essentially eliminating competition and inflating prices in the health foods market.

=== Subsidiary companies and suppliers ===
Whole Foods Market is based on a system of decentralized buying. Each vendor is approved at the regional level for corporate standards such as being non-GMO and fair trade. Individual stores then decide which approved products to stock. They have a rolling ten-year distribution arrangement with UNFI.

== 365 by Whole Foods Market ==

In June 2015, the company announced a millennial-focused, and more affordable version of its regular stores, called &quot;365 By Whole Foods Market&quot;. In addition to using digital price tags, in-store communication was done through a smartphone app. The stores had the goal of zero waste, which included donating leftover food, using LED lights, and using carbon dioxide–powered refrigeration cases. Jeff Turnas was president of the division.

The first 365 By Whole Foods Market store opened in May 2016 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. In December 2018, the eleventh and twelfth stores were opened at almost the same time in Atlanta and in Decatur, Georgia. Only 12 stores had been opened by the time Amazon acquired its parent Whole Foods and growth of the chain was finally halted.

There were as many as twenty-two 365 stores under various stages of construction by early July 2017, progress at most of these construction sites came to a halt upon the news of the possible acquisition of the parent company by Amazon, and there was no information at the time if and when the construction at any of the building sites would resume.

In January 2019, it was announced that the 365 by Whole Foods Market concept would be discontinued, but the existing locations would remain open. The following month, it was announced that all existing 365 stores would be converted into regular Whole Foods stores by the end of the year.

Although the short-lived chain is long gone, the &quot;365 by Whole Foods Market&quot; moniker is continue to be used by Whole Foods as a private label brand of low cost foods for both Whole Foods and Amazon.

== Whole Foods Market Daily Shop ==

In March 2024, Whole Foods announced the roll out of a new chain of quick-shop-format stores in Manhattan later this year that is much smaller than previous formats by being between and in size and initially selling grab-and-go snacks, prepared foods including sandwiches, weekly essentials, seasonal produce, breads, alcohol, meat and seafood, and an in-store Juice &amp; Java. Juice &amp; Java would offer customers made-to-order drinks, such as coffee, tea and smoothies, as well as soups, sandwiches and desserts.

The new stores are going to be located in dense metropolitan areas.

This is not the first time that Whole Foods tried a small footprint concept. In 2019, Whole Foods previously trialed a short lived convenience store concept in Chelsea that was also called &quot;Whole Foods Market Daily Shop&quot;.

<text>The Cincinnati Rockers were an arena football team based in Cincinnati, Ohio. They began play in 1992 as an expansion team in the Arena Football League and competed through the 1993 season before they suspended operations due to low attendance. The Rockers played their home games at the Riverfront Coliseum.

==History==
===1992===

The Rockers were announced in 1991 as successful restaurant owner Ted Gregory was granted the Arena league expansion the franchise. As one of four expansion teams for 1992, the Rockers sold 5,700 season tickets. In a bid to give the new franchise some credibility, the league persuaded the league&#x27;s strongest team, the Detroit Drive, to trade Art Schlichter to Cincinnati. Schlichter had grown up in nearby Bloomingburg and had starred at Ohio State, and still had some name recognition in the area. 

Additionally, the compulsive gambling that had derailed Schlichter&#x27;s NFL career had continued unabated during his two years with the Drive, to the point that he had to leave Detroit for his own safety. Schlichter signed a one-year $40,000 contract. Soon after that, he was arrested for passing a bad check, and admitted suffering a gambling relapse. Gregory worked out a deal in which the team put most of Schlichter&#x27;s paycheck into an account to pay off his gambling debts, except for $300 that they gave to his wife, Mitzi. It was to no avail; police were frequently waiting for Schlichter in the locker room.

The Rockers finished their first season in the league with a surprising 7–3 record, but lost in the first round of the playoffs 41–36 to the Tampa Bay Storm. 

===1993===

The Rockers suffered a major blow in the 1992-93 offseason when Schlichter was forced to retire. League officials learned that Schlichter was betting on AFL games. League commissioner Joe O&#x27;Hara recalled in 2020 that when he learned this, he called Gregory and told him Schlichter had to go. Facing the prospect of being banned from the league, Schlichter was allowed to publicly save face by retiring. Even before then, the Rockers were losing patience with Schlichter&#x27;s gambling; they had asked him to take a substantial pay cut to return for 1993.

The team ceased operations following a 2–10 season in 1993. The team&#x27;s attendance fell by almost 50%, leading to Tom Gregory&#x27;s decision to drop out of the AFL for the 1994 season. Gregory attempted to find additional sponsors to re-launch the team in 1995, but he instead sold the franchise to the Hartford Sports &amp; Entertainment Group, who moved the franchise to Hartford, Connecticut and became known as the Connecticut Coyotes.

<text>A rainstick is a long, hollow tube of bamboo or dried cactus that is partially filled with small pebbles, rice, dried beans, or other hard granular matter. The inside surface of the tube has small pins or thorns arranged helically. When the stick is rotated and held upright, the pebbles fall to the other end of the tube, bouncing off the internal protrusions to create a sound reminiscent of falling rain. 

The rainstick is believed to have been invented by the Mapuche and was played in the belief it could bring about rainstorms. It was also found on the Chilean coasts, though it is not certain if it was made by the Incas. Rainsticks are usually made from any of several species of cactus such as &quot;Eulychnia acida&quot; and &quot;Echinopsis pachanoi&quot;. The cacti, which are hollow, are dried in the sun. The spines are removed, then driven into the cactus like nails. Pebbles or other small objects are placed inside the rainsticks, and the ends are sealed.

Similar instruments can also be found in Southeast Asia, Australia and Africa, where it is often made using bamboo rather than dried cactus.

Rainsticks may also be made with common household materials like paper towel rolls instead of cactus, and nails or toothpicks instead of thorns, and they are often sold to tourists visiting parts of Latin America and also the Southwestern United States (which has a history of Spanish and Mexican cultural influence).

<text>Erica Miechowsky (born September 30, 1961), known professionally as Erica Ehm, is a Canadian writer, actor, songwriter, entrepreneur and TV host. She is best known as a pioneering video jockey at the Canadian cable television station MuchMusic.

==Biography==
She got her first job at CHOM-FM sorting records for DJs. She began her television career by contributing to &quot;Musi-Video&quot;, a local rock and video show produced in Montreal, Quebec. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications from the University of Ottawa.

Ehm moved to Toronto where she found a job working as a receptionist at Citytv, which owned the soon-to-launch cable channel MuchMusic, and when the new station began hiring video jockeys in 1984 she applied and became one of the station&#x27;s first VJs.

Ehm left MuchMusic in 1994, after ten years, to concentrate on her songwriting career. Since then, she has returned periodically to television, hosting or appearing in shows including &quot;Yummy Mummy&quot; on Life Network and Discovery Health in the U.S. among other countries, &quot;Popstars - The One&quot; (Global), &quot;Real Life with Erica Ehm&quot; (Life Network), &quot;Power Play&quot; (Discovery Channel Canada), &quot;The Company&quot; (TVOntario), &quot;Nestlé Baby and You&quot; (Rogers Cable) and &quot;Science: From A to Ehm&quot;. 

After having a child in 2000 with her spouse Terry Moshenberg, who founded The League of Rock, and another child in 2003, she runs the Yummy Mummy Club. She has written three stage musicals for the family market. After her first play, &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Big Party&quot;, sold out in theatres across North America, she was commissioned to write two other shows, &quot;The Big Comfy Couch&quot; and &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Big Book Club&quot;. 

Ehm has written songs which have been recorded by, among others, Van Morrison, Tim Thorney, Cassandra Vasik and Tom Jackson. She has won three Canadian Country Music Awards and three SOCAN Awards. She co-wrote the theme song for the animated film and series &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;. Her song &quot;Love Me Even More&quot; was chosen as the theme for the feature film &quot;Some Things That Stay&quot;. She had a modest acting career, appearing in &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; as a secretary, &quot;&quot; as television news anchor Rocky Crenshaw, as &quot;Benita&quot; in a stage play version of Brad Fraser&#x27;s &quot;Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love&quot;, as a madam in &quot;Replikator&quot; and as Vicky in &quot;Jigsaw&quot;. 

Ehm authored &quot;She Should Talk: Conversations with Exceptional Women about Life, Dreams and Success&quot;, published by HarperCollins, as well as a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Mischievous Mom at the Art Gallery&quot;. In 2002, she hosted a weekly call-in show on CFRB 1010, a Toronto news/talk radio station.

<doc id="620353" wikidata="Q2066326" url="?curid=620353" title="RecBCD">
<text>Exodeoxyribonuclease V (EC 3.1.11.5, RecBCD, Exonuclease V, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; exonuclease V, &quot;E. coli&quot; exonuclease V, gene recBC endoenzyme, RecBC deoxyribonuclease, gene recBC DNase, gene recBCD enzymes) is an enzyme of &quot;E. coli&quot; that initiates recombinational repair from potentially lethal double strand breaks in DNA which may result from ionizing radiation, replication errors, endonucleases, oxidative damage, and a host of other factors. The RecBCD enzyme is both a helicase that unwinds, or separates the strands of DNA, and a nuclease that makes single-stranded nicks in DNA. It catalyses exonucleolytic cleavage (in the presence of ATP) in either 5′- to 3′- or 3′- to 5′-direction to yield 5′-phosphooligonucleotides.

==Structure==
The enzyme complex is composed of three different subunits called RecB, RecC, and RecD and hence the complex is named RecBCD (Figure 1). Before the discovery of the &quot;recD&quot; gene, the enzyme was known as “RecBC.” Each subunit is encoded by a separate gene:

==Function==

Both the RecD and RecB subunits are helicases, &quot;i.e.&quot;, energy-dependent molecular motors that unwind DNA (or RNA in the case of other proteins). The RecB subunit in addition has a nuclease function. Finally, RecBCD enzyme (perhaps the RecC subunit) recognizes a specific sequence in DNA, 5&#x27;-GCTGGTGG-3&#x27;, known as Chi (sometimes designated with the Greek letter χ).

RecBCD is unusual amongst helicases because it has two helicases that travel with different rates and because it can recognize and be altered by the Chi DNA sequence. RecBCD avidly binds an end of linear double-stranded (ds) DNA. The RecD helicase travels on the strand with a 5&#x27; end at which the enzyme initiates unwinding, and RecB on the strand with a 3&#x27; end. RecB is slower than RecD, so that a single-stranded (ss) DNA loop accumulates ahead of RecB (Figure 2). This produces DNA structures with two ss tails (a shorter 3’ ended tail and a longer 5’ ended tail) and one ss loop (on the 3&#x27; ended strand) observed by electron microscopy. The ss tails can anneal to produce a second ss loop complementary to the first one; such twin-loop structures were initially referred to as “rabbit ears.”
== Mechanism of action ==
During unwinding the nuclease in RecB can act in different ways depending on the reaction conditions, notably the ratio of the concentrations of Mg2+ ions and ATP. (1) If ATP is in excess, the enzyme simply nicks the strand with Chi (the strand with the initial 3&#x27; end) (Figure 2). Unwinding continues and produces a 3&#x27; ss tail with Chi near its terminus. This tail can be bound by RecA protein, which promotes strand exchange with an intact homologous DNA duplex. When RecBCD reaches the end of the DNA, all three subunits disassemble and the enzyme remains inactive for an hour or more; a RecBCD molecule that acted at Chi does not attack another DNA molecule. (2) If Mg2+ ions are in excess, RecBCD cleaves both DNA strands endonucleolytically, although the 5&#x27; tail is cleaved less often (Figure 3). When RecBCD encounters a Chi site on the 3&#x27; ended strand, unwinding pauses and digestion of the 3&#x27; tail is reduced. When RecBCD resumes unwinding, it now cleaves the opposite strand (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the 5&#x27; tail) and loads RecA protein onto the 3’-ended strand. After completing reaction on one DNA molecule, the enzyme quickly attacks a second DNA, on which the same reactions occur as on the first DNA.

Although neither reaction has been verified by analysis of intracellular DNA, due to the transient nature of reaction intermediates, genetic evidence indicates that the first reaction more nearly mimics that in cells. For example, the activity of Chi is influenced by nucleotides to its 3&#x27; side, both in cells and in reactions with ATP in excess but not with Mg2+ in excess [PMIDs 27401752, 27330137]. RecBCD mutants lacking detectable exonuclease activity retain high Chi hotspot activity in cells and nicking at Chi outside cells. A Chi site on one DNA molecule in cells reduces or eliminates Chi activity on another DNA, perhaps reflecting the Chi-dependent disassembly of RecBCD observed in vitro under conditions of excess ATP and nicking of DNA at Chi.

Under both reaction conditions, the 3&#x27; strand remains intact downstream of Chi. The RecA protein is then actively loaded onto the 3&#x27; tail by RecBCD. At some undetermined point RecBCD dissociates from the DNA, although RecBCD can unwind at least 60 kb of DNA without falling off. RecA initiates exchange of the DNA strand to which it is bound with the identical, or nearly identical, strand in an intact DNA duplex; this strand exchange generates a joint DNA molecule, such as a D-loop (Figure 2). The joint DNA molecule is thought to be resolved either by replication primed by the invading 3’ ended strand containing Chi or by cleavage of the D-loop and formation of a Holliday junction. The Holliday junction can be resolved into linear DNA by the RuvABC complex or dissociated by the RecG protein. Each of these events can generate intact DNA with new combinations of genetic markers by which the parental DNAs may differ. This process, homologous recombination, completes the repair of the double-stranded DNA break.

==RecD1 and RecD2==

RecD enzymes are divided into two groups RecD1 (known as RecD) and RecD2. Many organisms have a &quot;recD&quot; gene even though the other members of a recBCD complex, i. e. rec B and recC, are not present. For instance, the bacterium &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot;, that has an extraordinary DNA repair capability, is an example of an organism that does not possess a &quot;recB&quot; or &quot;recC&quot; gene, and yet does have a &quot;recD&quot; gene. In the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, RecD protein is part of the well studied RecBCD complex that is necessary for recombinational DNA repair (as described above). In the bacterium &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, RecD2 protein has a role as a modulator of replication restart and also a modulator of the RecA recombinase. RecD2 may inhibit unwanted recombination events when replication forks are stalled, and also may have a role in displacing RecA protein from recombination intermediates in order to permit advance of the replication fork.

== Applications ==
RecBCD is a model enzyme for the use of single molecule fluorescence as an experimental technique used to better understand the function of protein-DNA interactions. The enzyme is also useful in removing linear DNA, either single- or double-stranded, from preparations of circular double-stranded DNA, since it requires a DNA end for activity.

<text>RuvABC is a complex of three proteins that mediate branch migration and resolve the Holliday junction created during homologous recombination in bacteria. As such, RuvABC is critical to bacterial DNA repair.
RuvA and RuvB bind to the four strand DNA structure formed in the Holliday junction intermediate, and migrate the strands through each other, using a putative spooling mechanism. The RuvAB complex can carry out DNA helicase activity, which helps unwind the duplex DNA. The binding of the RuvC protein to the RuvAB complex is thought to cleave the DNA strands, thereby resolving the Holliday junction.

==Protein complex==
The RuvABC is a complex of three proteins that resolve the Holliday junction formed during bacterial homologous recombination. In &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacteria, DNA replication forks stall at least once per cell cycle, so that DNA replication must be restarted if the cell is to survive. Replication restart is a multi-step process in &quot;E. coli&quot; that requires the sequential action of several proteins. When the progress of the replication fork is impeded the proteins single-stranded binding protein SSB and RecG helicase along with the RuvABC complex are required for rescue. The resolution of Holliday junctions that accumulate following replication on damaged DNA templates in &quot;E. coli&quot; requires the RuvABC complex.
===RuvA===
RuvA (Holliday junction branch migration complex subunit RuvA) is a DNA-binding protein that binds Holliday junctions with high affinity. The structure of the complex has been variously elucidated through X-ray crystallography and EM data, and suggest that the complex consists of either one or two RuvA tetramers, with charge lined grooves through which the incoming DNA is channelled. The structure also showed the presence of so-called &#x27;acidic pins&#x27; in the centre of the tetramer, which serve to separate the DNA duplexes. Its crystal structure has been solved at 1.9A.

===RuvB===
RuvB (Holliday junction branch migration complex subunit RuvB) is an ATPase that is only active in the presence of DNA and compared to RuvA, RuvB has a low affinity for DNA. The RuvB proteins are thought to form hexameric rings on the exit points of the newly formed DNA duplexes, and it is proposed that they &#x27;spool&#x27; the emerging DNA through the RuvA tetramer.

===RuvC===
RuvC (Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease RuvC) is the resolvase, which cleaves the Holliday junction. RuvC proteins have been shown to form dimers in solution and its structure has been solved at 2.5A. It is thought to bind either on the open, DNA exposed face of a single RuvA tetramer, or to replace one of the two tetramers. Binding is proposed to be mediated by an unstructured loop on RuvC, which becomes structured on binding RuvA. RuvC can be bound to the complex in either orientation, therefore resolving Holliday junctions in either a horizontal or vertical manner.

<doc id="620358" wikidata="Q581244" url="?curid=620358" title="Iapetus Ocean">
<text>The Iapetus Ocean (; ) existed in the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic eras of the geologic timescale (between 600 and 400 million years ago). It was in the southern hemisphere, between the paleocontinents of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia. The ocean disappeared with the Acadian, Caledonian and Taconic orogenies, when these three continents joined to form one big landmass called Euramerica. The &quot;southern&quot; Iapetus Ocean has been proposed to have closed with the Famatinian and Taconic orogenies, meaning a collision between Western Gondwana and Laurentia.

Because the Iapetus Ocean was positioned between continental masses that would at a much later time roughly form the opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean, it can be seen as a sort of precursor of the Atlantic, and the process by which it opened shares many similarities with that of the Atlantic&#x27;s initial opening in the Jurassic. The Iapetus Ocean was therefore named for the titan Iapetus, who in Greek mythology was the father of Atlas, after whom the Atlantic Ocean was named.

==Research history==

At the start of the 20th century, American paleontologist Charles Walcott noticed differences in early Paleozoic benthic trilobites of Laurentia (such as Olenellidae, the so-called &quot;Pacific fauna&quot;), as found in Scotland and western Newfoundland, and those of Baltica (such as Paradoxididae, often called the &quot;Atlantic fauna&quot;), as found in the southern parts of the British Isles and eastern Newfoundland. Geologists of the early 20th century presumed that a large trough, a so-called geosyncline, had existed between Scotland and England in the early Paleozoic, keeping the two sides separated.

With the development of plate tectonics in the 1960s, geologists such as Arthur Holmes and John Tuzo Wilson concluded that the Atlantic Ocean must have had a precursor before the time of Pangaea. Wilson also noticed that the Atlantic had opened at roughly the same place where its precursor ocean had closed. This led him to his Wilson cycle hypothesis.

==Geodynamic history==

===Neoproterozoic origin===
In many spots in Scandinavia basaltic dikes are found with ages between 670 and 650 million years. These are interpreted as evidence that by that time, rifting had started that would form the Iapetus Ocean. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Long Range dikes are also thought to have formed during the formation of the Iapetus Ocean. It has been proposed that both the Fen Complex in Norway and the Alnö Complex in Sweden formed as consequence to mild extensional tectonics in the ancient continent of Baltica that followed the opening of the Iapetus Ocean. 

The eastern Iapetus Ocean is believed to have opened around 590 Ma with the emplacement of the Central Iapetus Magmatic Province between Laurentia and Baltica. The southern Iapetus Ocean opened between Laurentia and southwestern Gondwana (now South America) about 550 Ma, close to the end of the Ediacaran period. At the time it did so the Adamastor Ocean further east closed. The opening of the Iapetus Ocean probably postdates the opening of the Puncoviscana Ocean, which is believed to have opened around 700 Ma as Laurentia drifted away from Amazonia, with the Iapetus Ocean being separated from the Puncoviscana Ocean by the ribbon-shaped Arequipa-Antofalla terrane. However, the formation of both oceans seems unrelated.

===Paleozoic===

Southwest of the Iapetus, a volcanic island arc evolved from the early Cambrian (540 million years ago) onward. This volcanic arc was formed above a subduction zone where the oceanic lithosphere of the Iapetus Ocean subducted southward under other oceanic lithosphere. From Cambrian times (about 550 million years ago) the western Iapetus Ocean began to grow progressively narrower due to this subduction. The same happened further north and east, where Avalonia and Baltica began to move towards Laurentia from the Ordovician (488–444 million years ago) onward.

Trilobite faunas of the continental shelves of Baltica and Laurentia are still very different in the Ordovician, but Silurian faunas show progressive mixing of species from both sides, because the continents moved closer together.

In the west, the Iapetus Ocean closed with the Taconic orogeny (480-430 million years ago), when the volcanic island arc collided with Laurentia. Some authors consider the oceanic basin south of the island arc also a part of the Iapetus, this branch closed during the later Acadian orogeny, when Avalonia collided with Laurentia.

It has been suggested that the southern Iapetus Ocean closed during a continental collision between Laurentia and Western Gondwana (South America). If factual the Taconic orogen would be the northward continuation of the Famatinian orogen exposed in Argentina.

Meanwhile, the eastern parts had closed too: the Tornquist Sea between Avalonia and Baltica already during the late Ordovician, the main branch between Baltica-Avalonia and Laurentia during the Grampian and Scandian phases of the Caledonian orogeny (440–420 million years ago).

At the end of the Silurian period (c. 420 million years ago) the Iapetus Ocean had completely disappeared and the combined mass of the three continents formed the &quot;new&quot; continent of Laurasia, which would itself be the northern component of the singular supercontinent of Pangaea.

<doc id="620359" wikidata="Q192893" url="?curid=620359" title="Jan Palach">
<text>Jan Palach (; 11 August 1948 – 19 January 1969) was a Czech student of history and political economics at Charles University in Prague. His self-immolation in 1969 at age 20 was a political protest against the end of the Prague Spring resulting from the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 by the Warsaw Pact armies.

==Early life==
Palach was born in and attended elementary school in Všetaty, where he was an avid reader of Jules Verne. He was an average student. His father died when Palach was 13 years old and Palach was raised in part by his grandfather. His brother, Jiří, was 7 years older. In 1963, Palach began studies at a gymnasium in Mělník. He graduated in 1966 and unsuccessfully applied to Charles University. He then attended Prague School of Economics but in September 1968, he transferred to the philosophy faculty at Charles University, where he studied history and political economics. In the summer of 1967, Palach worked on a chicken farm in the Soviet Union. There, he instigated a strike action with other Czech students, the result of which got their working hours reduced from 10 to 8 per day and catering was improved. On November 7, 1968, he participated in a demonstration for Czech independence.

==Death==

On 16 January 1969, in response to the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in which the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia to crush the Prague Spring reforms of Alexander Dubček&#x27;s government, Palach committed self-immolation in Wenceslas Square, suffering burns to 85% of his body.

According to Jaroslava Moserová, a burns specialist who was the first to provide care to Palach at the Charles University Faculty Hospital, Palach did not set himself on fire to protest against the Soviet occupation, but did so to protest against the &quot;demoralization&quot; of Czechoslovak citizens caused by the occupation.

Palach&#x27;s self-immolation was the third act of that kind after those of Ryszard Siwiec in Poland and Vasyl Makukh in Ukraine, which were successfully suppressed by the authorities and went mostly forgotten until the Revolutions of 1989. Palach was not known to be aware of Siwiec&#x27;s and Makukh&#x27;s protests.

The burning at the stake of Jan Hus in 1415 for his beliefs may have been an inspiration for Palach&#x27;s self-immolation.

According to a letter he sent to several public figures, an entire clandestine resistance organization had been established with the purpose of practising self-immolation until their demands were met; however, it seems that such a group never existed. The demands declared in the letter were the abolition of censorship and a halt to the distribution of &quot;Zprávy&quot;, the official newspaper of the Soviet occupying forces. In addition, the letter called for the Czech and the Slovak peoples to go on a general strike in support of these demands. An earlier draft of the letter that Palach wrote also called for the resignation of a number of pro-Soviet politicians, but that demand did not make it into the final version, which included the remark that &quot;our demands are not extreme; on the contrary&quot;. Palach died from his burns three days after his act, in the hospital. On his deathbed, he was visited by a female acquaintance from his college and by a student leader, to whom he had addressed one of the copies of his letter. It was reported that he had pleaded for others not to do what he had done but instead to continue the struggle by other means, although it has been doubted whether he really said that.

The funeral of Palach turned into a major protest against the occupation. A month later, on 25 February, another student, Jan Zajíc, burned himself to death in the same place. This was followed in April of the same year by Evžen Plocek in Jihlava, and by others. People in other Warsaw Pact countries emulated his example such as Hungarians Sándor Bauer on 20 January 1969 and Márton Moyses on 13 February 1970.

==Posthumous recognition==

Palach was initially interred in Olšany Cemetery in Prague. As his gravesite was becoming a national shrine, the StB (Czechoslovak secret police) set out to destroy any memory of Palach&#x27;s deed and exhumed his remains during the night of 25 October 1973. They then cremated his body and sent the ashes to his mother in his home town of Všetaty; the body of an anonymous old woman from a rest-home was laid in the vacated grave. Palach&#x27;s mother was not allowed to deposit the urn in the local cemetery until 1974. On 25 October 1990, Palach&#x27;s ashes were officially returned to his initial gravesite in Prague.

On the 20th anniversary of Palach&#x27;s death, between 15 and 21 January 1989, protests in Prague ostensibly in memory of Palach (but intended anticommunist demonstrations) escalated into what would be called &quot;Palach Week&quot;. They were suppressed by the police, who beat demonstrators and used water cannons, often catching passers-by in the fray. Palach Week is considered one of the catalyst demonstrations which preceded the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia 10 months later.

After the Velvet Revolution, Palach (along with Zajíc) was commemorated in Prague by a bronze cross embedded at the spot where he fell outside the National Museum, as well as the naming of Jan Palach Square in his honour. Czech astronomer Luboš Kohoutek, who left Czechoslovakia the following year, named an asteroid, 1834 Palach, which was discovered on 22 August 1969 after Palach. There are several other memorials to Palach in cities throughout Europe, including a small memorial inside the glacier tunnels beneath the Jungfraujoch in Switzerland.

Several copycat suicides may have been influenced by the example of Palach and his media popularity. In the spring of 2003, six young Czechs burned themselves to death, including a 19-year-old student from Humpolec who burned himself on almost the same spot in front of the National Museum where Palach burnt himself, leaving a suicide note explicitly referring to Palach and the others who killed themselves in 1969. 

==Cultural references==

===In music===
The music video for the song &quot;Club Foot&quot; by the band Kasabian is dedicated to Palach. The composition &quot;The Funeral of Jan Palach&quot; performed by The Zippo Band and composed by Phil Kline is a tribute. He is mentioned in The Stranglers&#x27; bassist, Jean-Jacques Burnel&#x27;s 1979 solo album, &quot;Euroman Cometh&quot;.

In their 1983 song &quot;Nuuj Helde&quot; the Janse Bagge Bend (from the Netherlands) asks whether people know why Jan Palach burned. This song was meant to make the general public aware of heroes.

It includes a setting of words which appeared briefly on a statue in Wenceslas Square after the event, before being erased by the authorities: &quot;Do not be indifferent to the day when the light of the future was carried forward by a burning body&quot;.

Spanish composer Jorge Grundman wrote his 2018 work &quot;Jan &amp; Jan for Chorus and Symphonic Orchestra (op 68)&quot; as an hommage to Jan Palach and Jan Zajic. The work premiered at the Spanish National Auditorium of Music in 2019 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the self-immolation of both students. The chorus sings an adaptation of Palach&#x27;s letter addressing his family.

Israeli musician Arik Einstein sang about the Prague Spring in his 1969 song &quot;Prague&quot;, and dedicated a verse to Palach&#x27;s self-immolation.

A sequence of poems exploring the implications of Palach&#x27;s death called &quot;One Match&quot; by the poet Sheila Hamilton were published in issue 51 of the Dorset-based poetry serial, &quot;Tears in the Fence&quot; (ed. David Caddy) in 2010.

Czech poet Miroslav Holub wrote a poem entitled the &quot;Prague of Jan Palach&quot; (1969) in memory of the martyr. A line from the poem translated into English by George Theiner reads, &quot;where Man ends/ the flame begins.&quot;

<doc id="620360" wikidata="Q833106" url="?curid=620360" title="Exile and the Kingdom">
<text>Exile and the Kingdom () is a 1957 collection of six short stories by French writer Albert Camus. First published in French, in translation, it was not well received by contemporary English critics. The underlying theme of these stories is human loneliness and feeling foreign and isolated in one&#x27;s own society. Camus writes about outsiders living in Algeria who straddle the divide between the Muslim world and France.

== Stories ==
These works of fiction cover the whole variety of existentialism, or absurdism, as Camus himself insisted his philosophical ideas be called. The clearest manifestation of the ideals of Camus can be found in the story &quot;&quot;La Pierre qui pousse&quot;.&quot; This story features D&#x27;Arrast, who can be seen as a positive hero as opposed to Meursault in &quot;The Stranger&quot;. He actively shapes his life and sacrifices himself in order to help a friend, instead of remaining passive. The moral quality of his actions is intensified by the fact that D&#x27;Arrast has deep insight into the absurdity of the world but acts morally nevertheless (not unlike the main character in &quot;The Plague&quot;). In the &quot;Silent Men,&quot; Camus reveals his understanding of the life of lower class laborers. The main character, Yvars, is a barrel maker, like Camus&#x27;s uncle, for whom he worked as a teenager.

The six works collected in this volume are:

*&quot;The Adulterous Woman&quot; (&quot;La Femme adultère&quot;)
*&quot;The Renegade or a Confused Spirit&quot; (&quot;Le Renégat ou un esprit confus&quot;)
*&quot;The Silent Men&quot; (&quot;Les Muets&quot;)
*&quot;The Guest&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Hôte&quot;)
*&quot;Jonas or the Artist at Work&quot; (&quot;Jonas ou l’artiste au travail&quot;)
*&quot;The Growing Stone&quot; (&quot;La Pierre qui pousse&quot;)

<text>A cointegrate is the intermediate molecule between donor DNA and target DNA covalently bind during the formation of a Holliday junction. Transposons elements are DNA sequences that can change its position within the genome, sometimes creating reversing mutations. A number of bacterial transposons, especially those related to Tn3 Tn552, encodes two recombinases that participate in their transposition to other DNA. The initial step that mediated this process involve the formation of cointegrate. The cointegrate is formed between the transposon containing donor DNA and the target molecule. In this transpositional intermediate, the donor and target DNAs are joined together by copies of the duplicated transposon, one copy occurring at each donor–target junction.

<text>Never Cry Wolf is a fictional account of the author&#x27;s subjective experience observing wolves in subarctic Canada by Farley Mowat, first published in 1963 by McClelland and Stewart. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1983. It has been credited for dramatically improving the public image of the wolf.

==Form of the book==
In the book, Mowat describes his experiences in a first-person narrative that sheds light on his research into the nature of the Arctic wolf in Keewatin Barren Lands, north of Churchill, Manitoba.

In 1948–1949, the Dominion Wildlife Service assigned the author to investigate the cause of declining caribou populations and determine whether wolves are to blame for the shortage. Upon finding his quarry near Nueltin Lake, Mowat discovers that rather than being wanton killers of caribou, the wolves subsist quite heavily on small mammals such as rodents and hares, &quot;even choosing them over caribou when available.&quot;

==Conclusions==
He concludes: &quot;We have doomed the wolf not for what it is but for what we deliberately and mistakenly perceive it to be: the mythologized epitome of a savage, ruthless killer—which is, in reality, not more than the reflected image of ourselves. We have made it the scapewolf for our own sins.&quot; Mowat writes to expose the onslaught of wolfers and government exterminators who are out to erase the wolves from the Arctic.

==Points and claims==
Mowat&#x27;s book says that:
* The main reason for declining population of caribou is human hunters from civilization.
* Wolves that hunt a large herd animal would rather attack weaker, injured, or older animals, which helps rid the herd of members that slow its migration.
* Arctic wolves usually prey on Arctic ox, caribou, smaller mammals, and rodents—but since they rely on stamina instead of speed, it would be logical for the wolves to choose smaller prey instead of large animals like caribou, which are faster and stronger, and therefore a more formidable target. One of these animals may include mice.
* A lone Arctic wolf has a better chance of killing small prey by running alongside it and attacking its neck. The wolf would be at a disadvantage if it attacked large prey from behind, because the animal&#x27;s powerful hind legs could injure the wolf. However, a group of wolves may successfully attack large prey from a number of positions.
* Since Arctic wolves often travel in a group, their best strategy is not to kill surplus prey, since the whole group can sate themselves on one or two large animals. There are, however, exceptions to this.
* Local Eskimos (Inuit) could interpret wolves&#x27; howls. They can tell things such as whether a herd or a human is passing through the wolves&#x27; territory, the direction of travel, and more.

==Reception==
Barry Lopez in his 1978 work &quot;Of Wolves and Men&quot; called the book a dated, but still good, introduction to wolf behaviour.

In a 2001 article of &quot;The Canadian Historical Review&quot; entitled &quot;Never Cry Wolf: Science, Sentiment, and the Literary Rehabilitation of Canis Lupus&quot;, Karen Jones lauded the work as &quot;an important chapter in the history of Canadian environmentalism&quot;;

Mowat&#x27;s book has received criticism relating to the veracity of his work and its conclusions. Canadian Wildlife Service official Alexander William Francis Banfield, who supervised Mowat&#x27;s field work, characterised the book as &quot;semi-fictional&quot;, and accused Mowat of blatantly lying about his expedition. He pointed out that contrary to what is written in the book, Mowat was part of an expedition of three biologists, and was never alone. Banfield also pointed out that a lot of what was written in &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; was not derived from Mowat&#x27;s first hand observations, but were plagiarised from Banfield&#x27;s own works, as well as from Adolph Murie&#x27;s &quot;The Wolves of Mount McKinley&quot;. In a 1964 article published in the &quot;Canadian Field-Naturalist&quot;, he compared Mowat&#x27;s 1963 bestseller to Little Red Riding Hood, claiming that, &quot;I hope that readers of &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; will realize that both stories have about the same factual content.&quot; Mowat&#x27;s humorous response to Banfield&#x27;s review appeared in a subsequent letter to the editor of the same journal -- ostensibly written by &quot;Uncle Albert&quot;.

In the May 1996 issue of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, John Goddard wrote a heavily researched article entitled &quot;A Real Whopper&quot;, in which he poked many holes in Mowat&#x27;s claim that the book was non-fictional. He wrote:

Mowat excoriated Goddard&#x27;s article as, &quot;...bullshit, pure and simple... this guy&#x27;s got as many facts wrong as there are flies on a toad that&#x27;s roadkill.&quot; Journalist Val Ross of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; agreed that &quot;Mowat, more passionate polemicist than rigorous reporter, painted federal bureaucrats in darker colours than many deserved,&quot; but that Goddard&#x27;s piece erred in the same way against Mowat.

Although a claim that Mowat makes was that he interacted closely with a wolf pack alone in order to study them, the first wildlife biologist to successfully use the method of habituation to study and follow wild wolf packs in close proximity was fellow CWS scientist and International Wolf Specialist Group Canadian representative Dr. Lu Carbyn, in a 1970s study in Jasper National Park. Although also pointing out &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot;&#x27;s fictional rather than factual nature, his remarks were less critical, calling Farley Mowat&#x27;s book &quot;Good fiction and good reading&quot;.

In 2012, Mowat spoke to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; about his reputation as a storyteller: &quot;I took some pride in having it known that I never let facts get in the way of a good story. I was writing subjective non-fiction all along.&quot;

== Impact ==
&quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; was a commercial success in Canada. Shortly after its publication, the Canadian Wildlife Service received a deluge of letters from concerned citizens opposing the killing of wolves. Though generally well received by the public, Mowat&#x27;s allusions of the Canadian Wildlife Service as an organisation set out to exterminate wolves was met with anger from Canadian biologists. CWS staff members argued that the agency had never demanded the extermination of the wolf, the wolf being recognized as an integral part of the northern ecosystem. They further countered that Mowat&#x27;s remit had not been to find justifications for wolf extermination, but to investigate the relationship between wolves and caribou. The locals were actually hunting the caribou, for a sport and a food source.

As with Mowat&#x27;s other books, &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; was translated into Russian and published in the Soviet Union. The book&#x27;s message that wolves were harmless mouse-eaters became influential, leading to popular reaction against Soviet wolf-culling efforts.

<text>International emergency medicine is a subspecialty of emergency medicine that focuses not only on the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term &quot;international emergency medicine&quot; generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledge—including knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital care—from developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one&#x27;s native country.

Emergency medicine has been a recognized medical specialty in the United States and other developed countries for nearly forty years, although these countries&#x27; EMSs did not become fully mature until the early 1990s. At that point, some of its practitioners turned their attention from developing the specialty at home to developing it abroad, leading to the birth of international emergency medicine. They began to support the growth of emergency medicine worldwide, doing so through conferences, national and regional emergency medicine organizations, relief and development organizations, international emergency medicine fellowships, physician exchanges, information transfer, and curriculum development.

Most developing countries are taking steps to develop emergency medicine as a specialty, to develop accreditation mechanisms, and to promote the development of emergency medicine training programs. Their interest is a result of improved healthcare, increasing urbanization, aging populations, the rising number of traffic fatalities, and heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their citizens. In addition, emergency medicine is useful in dealing with time-sensitive illnesses, as well as improving public health through vaccinations, interventions, training, and data collection. Countries that lack mature EMSs are developing emergency medicine as a specialty so that they will be able to set up training programs and encourage medical students to pursue residencies in emergency medicine.

Some challenges faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non-existent training programs, a lack of adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine. Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries due to a lack of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. Evidence-based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.

==Background==

===Definition===
The most commonly accepted definition of international emergency medicine is that it is &quot;the area of emergency medicine concerned with the development of emergency medicine in other countries.&quot; In that definition, &quot;other countries&quot; refers to nations that do not have a mature emergency care system (exemplified by board-certified emergency physicians and academic emergency medicine, among other things). Included in those nations are some that are otherwise quite developed but lack a complete emergency medical system, such as Armenia, China, Israel, Nicaragua, and the Philippines. Work in international emergency medicine can be broken down into two main categories: 1) the promotion of emergency medicine as a recognized and established specialty in other countries, and 2) the provision of humanitarian assistance.

William Burdick, Mark Hauswald, and Kenneth Iserson have criticized the above definition as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From that point of view, international emergency medicine is not solely about development of emergency medical systems but is instead better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one&#x27;s native country.

===History===

====Emergency medicine====

Emergency medicine is a specialty that was first developed in the United States in the 1960s. For the United States, the high number of traffic and other accident fatalities in the 1960s spurred a white paper from the National Academy of Sciences; it exposed the inadequacy of the current emergency medical system and led to the establishment of modern emergency medical services. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore followed shortly thereafter, developing their respective emergency medicine systems in the 1970s and 1980s.

====Beginning of the subspecialty====
By the early 1990s, the emergency medicine systems (EMSs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some practitioners to focus on developing the specialty in other countries. Thus, international emergency medicine as a subspecialty began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals had taken place in the late 1980s. There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad. One was the contrast between the EMSs of their countries and the EMSs of other countries. Another was the revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated spread of new ideas, such as emergency medicine.

Two international emergency medicine conferences were launched in the 1980s, the International Conference on Emergency Medicine (ICEM) and the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine Conference (WADEM). ICEM was founded by the International Federation of Emergency Medicine, while WADEM was started by an organization of the same name. Additionally, in the 1990s various national and regional emergency medicine organizations began supporting the development of the specialty in other countries, including the American College of Emergency Physicians, the European Society for Emergency Medicine, and the Asian Society of Emergency Medicine.

Furthermore, countries without mature EMSs began taking more interest in developing them. One reason for this interest was the overall improvement in healthcare in these countries. Another was the increasing urbanization taking place worldwide and the corresponding shift of focus from infectious diseases to trauma and cardiorespiratory diseases, which are better managed by emergency medicine than prevention. In addition to these developments, the aging population in many countries has led to an increased need for emergency medical services. Also, American popular culture, particularly television shows, and &quot;the demonstrated success of emergency medicine&quot; in countries with mature EMSs both led the public in many countries to expect better emergency medical care.

International emergency medicine organizations, whether focused on relief or development, have also contributed to the growth of the subspecialty. Relief organizations, such as Doctors Without Borders or AmeriCares, serve countries that do not have mature EMSs when health catastrophes occur. These organizations also serve to &quot;enhance [the specialty&#x27;s] image in the international public eye&quot;. Some development organizations, such as Emergency International or the International Federation for Emergency Medicine, help establish and develop emergency care systems in other countries by providing &quot;ongoing educational and organizational assistance.&quot;

===Emergency medicine in the developing world===
Motor vehicle crashes were a major factor that led to the development of emergency medicine in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and they are a major factor leading countries to develop their own emergency medical systems today. Such crashes represent a leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults, with the majority of deaths occurring in the developing world. In recent decades, while traffic fatalities have declined in industrialized nations, they have been on the rise in developing ones. Furthermore, developing nations tend to have a higher proportion of fatalities per number of vehicles for various reasons, including lower safety standards for vehicles. The lack of available emergency care in many developing countries only serves to exacerbate this problem. This higher rate of accident mortality per vehicle exists despite the fact that there are fewer cars in Asia and Africa than in the West. Odero et al. argue that this shows a need to improve emergency medical care. 
Emergency medical care applies to other acute health problems as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements are common in developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable for much of the world&#x27;s population.

For instance, a 2008 study of medical systems in Zambia published by the International Anesthesia Research Society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients. Just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen, with only 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind. Furthermore, only 29 intensive care beds were available in all of the hospitals surveyed, and these were only found in major hospitals. This implies that the majority of critically ill patients are receiving care in general hospital wards.

Anderson et al. argue that, aside from acute care, emergency medicine can also play a significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial &quot;presentation&quot; (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.

===Models of emergency care===
There are two primary models of emergency medicine: the Anglo-American model, which relies on &quot;bringing the patient to the hospital&quot;, and the Franco-German model, which operates through &quot;bringing the hospital to the patient&quot;. Thus, in the Anglo-American model, the patient is rapidly transported by non-physician providers to definitive care such as an emergency department in a hospital. Conversely, the Franco-German approach has a physician, often an anesthesiologist, come to the patient and provide stabilizing care in the field. The patient is then triaged directly to the appropriate department of a hospital. The Anglo-American model is seen in nations such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, while the Franco-German model is found in European countries such as Austria, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, and Russia. Most developing emergency medical systems, including those of China, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, have been established along Anglo-American lines, but little work exists to establish the advantage of either system.

Jeffrey Arnold and James Holliman have criticized the use of these descriptors for emergency medical systems as an oversimplification and a needless source of controversy. Instead, Arnold and Holliman have proposed that other groupings be used, such as classifying emergency medical systems as following a specialty or multidisciplinary model. Specialty systems would include those with physicians dedicated to emergency medicine, whereas multidisciplinary systems would encompass those that rely on physicians from other disciplines to provide emergency care. Such an approach would seek to categorize pre-hospital care separately from in-hospital systems. Within Arnold and Holliman&#x27;s understanding of emergency care models, there is also an acknowledgement that current Western models may be inadequate in the context of developing nations. For instance, a cost–benefit analysis found that creating an EMS system in Kuala Lumpur that met U.S. standards for cardiac arrest response (85 percent of patients receive defibrillation within 6 minutes) would cost US$2.5 million and only save four neurologically intact lives per year. The primary variable responsible for that result is the relatively young demography of Kuala Lumpur, meaning that comparatively few cardiac-related deaths occur. 
An example of a developing nation establishing its own model of emergency medicine may be seen in southern Brazil. Elements of both of the major conventional models have been incorporated, with the EMS system following French influences and the ambulances being staffed by physicians, while an American approach to emergency medical residency training is also present.

==Role in overall health system==

===Developed countries===
In developed counties, training programs specifically relating to the international practice of emergency medicine are now available within many emergency medicine residencies. The curriculum that should be covered by such programs has been the subject of much discussion. Patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, communication skills, professionalism, and system-based practice are the basic six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but the application of these goals can take many forms.
The breadth of skills needed in international emergency medicine make it unlikely that one standardized program could fulfill the training needs for every scenario. 
One Australian study found that the primary topics covered by U.S. fellowship programs were emergency medicine systems development, humanitarian relief, disaster management, public health, travel and field medicine, program administration, and academic skills. Its authors argue that attempting to cover all of those areas may be unrealistic and that a more targeted focus on acquiring necessary skills might be more productive.

After such training is completed, or even without any EMS training, working in or visiting other nations is one way physicians can participate in international emergency medicine. Some physicians choose to pursue their careers overseas, while others opt for shorter trips. For example, a team of U.S. physicians spent seven months helping establish a new emergency department and emergency residency program in Hangzhou, China.
Such exchanges can be mutually beneficial. For instance, 23 to 28 percent of all physicians in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada received their training at medical schools outside of the country in which they currently practice.

===Developing countries===

The experience of international emergency medicine in developing countries is in some ways the opposite of that of developed ones. As of the 2000s, developing countries are attempting to establish effective systems of care and recognized specialty programs with assistance from health care providers from the developed world. In 2005, there were only a few countries with advanced emergency medical systems, and a far greater number (50+) that were in the process of developing those systems. 
The process of development usually begins in academia and patient care, followed by administrative and economic concerns, and finally health policy and agendas.

Given the limited resources of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine fits into the health system. Preventive care is a crucial part of healthcare in developing countries, and it may be difficult to budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.

==Initiatives to expand emergency medicine==

===Curriculum development===
Hobgood et al. argue that one key component in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems is to identify the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to the specific needs of the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.

===Transferring knowledge===
Countries with decades of experience in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.

Another conduit for the transfer of knowledge is the International Conference on Emergency Medicine, a conference held every two years for worldwide emergency physicians by the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM). In 2012, the conference took place in Dublin, Ireland. The organization was founded in 1991 by four national emergency physician organizations: the American College of Emergency Physicians, the British Association for Emergency Medicine, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, and the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine. The conference rotated between the founding members until 2010, when it was held in Singapore. Many new members have been accepted since the mid-1990s, when the IFEM decided to open up membership to other nations&#x27; emergency medicine organizations; the conference will rotate to them as well. For instance, in 2014 the conference will be hosted in Hong Kong and in 2016 it will be held in Cape Town, South Africa.

There are other conferences on international emergency medicine as well, including the one that the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM) has held every two years since 1987. However, WADEM focuses more on disaster medicine than emergency medicine system development, and many of its member physicians are not specialists in emergency medicine. Additionally, the European Society for Emergency Medicine (EuSEM) has hosted an annual conference since 1998. EuSEM also publishes &quot;The European Journal of Emergency Medicine&quot;, develops recommendations for emergency medicine standards for European countries, and supports a disaster medicine training center and degree program in San Marino. The Asian Society for Emergency Medicine (Asian Society), which was founded in 1998, holds its own biennial conference. In addition to that, the Asian Society, like the EuSEM, develops curriculum recommendations for Asian countries.

===Developing emergency medicine as a specialty===
One way to advance emergency medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it. Without such recognition, it is difficult to set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainty of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.

An alternate route for developing emergency medicine is to provide additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion it is difficult for emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.

==Challenges==

===Training===
Educational opportunities in emergency medicine are not available in many countries, and even when present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program in emergency medicine following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians in emergency medicine each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization of the program is modeled on South Africa&#x27;s program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa and Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of emergency medicine. Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.

To deal with this shortage of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip a small group of trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.

===Emergency transport===
The limitations on resources available in developing countries are particularly evident in the area of emergency transport. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed, there may be no roads at all. One study found that modes of transport as diverse as motorboats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts were used for emergency transport.

In more advanced developing countries, establishing ambulance transport systems is more feasible, but still requires considerable expertise and planning. Prior to 2004, Pakistan did not have an organized emergency medical system. In that year, Rescue 1122 was launched as a professional pre-hospital emergency service, and it has managed to achieve an average response time of 7 minutes, comparable to that of developed nations. Some of the critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles, training instructors to certify emergency medical technicians, adopting training materials to the local context, and branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure.

===Resources===

The vital nature of coping with the lack of resources available in international emergency medicine may be seen in the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children&#x27;s weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.

===Lack of research===
Despite the thought that increasing availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published, implying that much of the current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine&#x27;s impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.

A development in recent years that seeks to address these issues has been termed evidence-based medicine. As its name suggests, this approach strives to rigorously study the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition. Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing the current standard of emergency care.

<text>The Dorian invasion (or Dorian migration) is an ancient Greek myth and discredited archaeological hypothesis describing the movement of the Dorian people into the Peloponnese region of Greece. According to the myth, the Dorians migrated from central Greece shortly after the Trojan War and populated most of the southern Peloponnese, particularly the regions of Laconia, Messenia and the Argolid. The myth became combined with that of the Return of the Heracleidae, such that the descendants of the hero Heracles were imagined to have led the Dorians and founded the ruling lines of several Dorian cities, including Sparta. The myth probably emerged during the Early Iron Age as part of a process of ethnogenesis between cities claiming Dorian ancestry. In the fifth century BCE, it gained greater prominence through its use to promote unity among Sparta&#x27;s Peloponnesian allies, and to differentiate Sparta from its rival Athens, believed to be of Ionian heritage. 

In 1824, the German antiquarian Karl Otfried Müller published &quot;The Dorians&quot;, in which he argued that the Dorians were a northern, Indo-European people who invaded Greece and subjugated the Peloponnese. Müller&#x27;s views gained general scholarly acceptance throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. The Dorians were credited with introducing new forms of material culture and destroying the Mycenaean palaces, though this created conflicts between the interpretative narrative, the mythological tradition, and the archaeological evidence. The Dorians also became associated with the Sea Peoples, believed to have destroyed several Near Eastern sites at the end of the Bronze Age. During the first half of the twentieth century, scholars attempted to find archaeological and linguistic evidence of the Dorian invasion and to trace its route, though these efforts proved largely unsuccessful. 

Müller and his successors, such as Ernst Curtius, considered the Dorians to have been racially and culturally superior to the peoples whom they replaced. German nationalists, following Hermann Müller, portrayed the Dorians as belonging to a Nordic race, and so being fundamentally Germanic in character. The Dorian invasion became connected with the romanticisation of ancient Sparta, and was used to assert a special connection between Prussia and ancient Greece. During the Nazi period, the association between the Dorians and the Aryans became a matter of orthodoxy, and high-ranking Nazis, including Adolf Hitler, integrated the Dorian invasion into their pseudoscientific theories of race. Racialised views of the Dorians remained common in scholarship, both inside and outside Germany, until the 1960s. 

Although Müller&#x27;s narrative of the Dorian invasion received early challenges, particularly from Karl Julius Beloch in 1893, it was only rarely questioned until the decipherment of the Mycenaean Linear B script in 1952. Archaeological discoveries in the 1960s demonstrated that the cultural innovations previously ascribed to the Dorians were spread over a long period, often showing continuity from Bronze Age Mycenaean civilisation, and often arose in regions, such as Attica and Euboea, believed to have been unaffected by the invasion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, academic belief in the Dorian invasion declined, to the point where it was generally accepted as a myth. Modern archaeologists explain the collapse of Mycenaean palatial civilisation through factors including social conflicts, climate change, technological developments and the breakdown of the palaces&#x27; socio-economic model. Population movements at the end of the Bronze Age are believed to have been relatively small in scale and generally to have been directed away from, rather than towards, the southern Peloponnese. 

== Classical period ==

In the classical period (that is, from ), the Dorians were an ethno-linguistic group, speaking the Doric dialect of Greek, concentrated in the southern Peloponnese, Crete, Sicily and the Dodecanese. Several cultural forms were identified as &quot;Dorian&quot; in classical times, such as the Doric order of architecture, the Dorian mode in music, and the Doric dialect. These were not exclusive to communities considered Dorian, some of which used other linguistic dialects: Halicarnassus, for instance, was considered a Dorian city into the Hellenistic period (323–30 BCE), but used Ionic for official inscriptions from the fifth century BCE and may never have widely spoken Doric. The Doric dialect itself was diverse and closely related to other varieties of Greek, and may not have originated from a single proto-dialect.

The ancient Greeks considered the Dorians to have migrated to the Peloponnese from central Greece, led by the descendants of the hero Heracles (the Heracleidae), around the end of the age of heroes (roughly the Late Bronze Age or the late second millennium BCE), shortly after the Trojan War. The myth appears to have originated in the Argolid or in Sparta at the end of the Early Iron Age, and to have combined earlier mythic traditions concerning the Dorians and the Heracleidae. Two further Dorian migrations were believed to have occurred: the first resulted in the foundation of Doric colonies in the southern Aegean and in Asia Minor, while the second, in the eighth century BCE, established Doric-speaking communities at Cyrene and in Magna Graecia. At least initially, the stories of the Dorian migration and the Return of the Heracleidae formed separate traditions, which were combined by the time of Herodotus (that is, the mid-fifth century BCE) at the latest. By the late fifth century BCE, Greeks considered the Dorian invasion a major turning point in their history, and it was reckoned as the beginning of the main line of historical continuity for Dorian states in the Peloponnese. 

The earliest surviving attestation of the myth is in the work of the seventh-century BCE Spartan poet Tyrtaeus. The term used for the Heraclidae&#x27;s return by Herodotus is , which can mean both &quot;descent&quot; and &quot;return from exile&quot;. By the sixth century BCE, the ethnic divisions between the Heracleidae and the Dorians were often elided, such that the Heracleidae and Heracles himself were often imagined to be Dorians, and the Dorian invasion of the Peloponnese to be a homeward journey. Similarly, the term &quot;Return of the Heracleidae&quot; was often used to refer to the Dorian migration into that region. The most complete surviving accounts of the myth are those of the first-century BCE historian Diodorus Siculus and the , a mythological compendium dating to the first or second century CE, but these probably followed earlier sources closely. It was also alluded to by the Theban poet Pindar, who wrote in the early fifth century BCE.

=== As a foundation myth ===

The narrative of the Dorian invasion was particularly important in Sparta, where it formed the city&#x27;s foundation myth. Tyrtaeus wrote of the Spartans as Dorians, who arrived in the land of Laconia from Erineus, in Doris, with the Heracleidae. There, Zeus and Hera granted Sparta to the Heracleidae: the two Spartan royal lines – the Agiad and Eurypontid dynasties – claimed descent from Heracles into the classical period. The version of the invasion narrative used in Sparta seems to have been a pastiche of various myths, with only a tenuous connection to the ancient Greeks&#x27; understanding of the Dorians as a people: the historian Nigel Kennell has called it &quot;drastically underwritten&quot; and likely to have developed in Laconia itself. Functionally, the story of the Dorian invasion, in conjunction with the story of the Heracleidae, served to assert Sparta&#x27;s right to its territory in the Peloponnese, both in Laconia and in Messenia. 

In Messenia itself, a version of the myth held that the Dorians had killed the Heraclid Kresphontes, who was allotted the kingdom after the initial Heraclid contest. After the restoration of Messenian independence by Epaminondas of Thebes in 370 BCE, this latter version was emphasised, and the newly founded tribes of Messenia were given the names of Heracles&#x27;s descendants rather than the traditional names of the Dorian tribal groups of the region. Nino Luraghi interprets this as a means of breaking the perceived links between Messenia and Sparta: the latter was considered, in his words, &quot;the quintessence of Dorianism&quot;. 

Sparta used the myth of the Dorian invasion to justify the Tanagra campaign of 457, in which they sent troops to fight on behalf of Doris against an invasion from Phocis, an ally of Sparta&#x27;s enemy Athens. During the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta at the end of the fifth century BCE, Sparta asserted kinship with its Peloponnesian allies through a claim of common Dorian heritage. Around the reign of the Roman emperor Hadrian (), Sparta underwent a campaign of reasserting itself as the quintessential Dorian city, including efforts to re-establish what were considered primordial Doric cultural forms, including the &quot;hyperdoricisation&quot; of its dialect. A reference in the work of the second-century CE geographer Pausanias, where the Messenians appeal to the Spartans on the basis of their shared Dorian ancestry during the Second Messenian War in the seventh century BCE, is unlikely to be historical.

== Modern archaeological hypothesis ==

=== Origins ===
Early archaeological work in the nineteenth century gave the impression of a substantial break between the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age in Greece. This was considered to be marked by the introduction of new material culture, specifically bronze violin-bow fibulae, a new sword of the Naue II type, cremation, cist graves, and – of most importance – ironworking. These cultural changes were associated with the arrival of newcomers, and those newcomers named as the Dorians. Destruction layers at Mycenaean palatial sites were then attributed to this putative invasion, even though such destruction went unmentioned in ancient accounts of Dorian origins.

In 1824, Karl Otfried Müller published &quot;The Dorians&quot; (). He argued that the Dorians were a northern, Indo-European (in German, ) people who invaded Greece and subjugated the Peloponnese. He characterised the Dorians as a &quot;young race&quot;, superior in their individual characters, their political organisation, and their language. Müller&#x27;s student, Ernst Curtius, called them &quot;northern mountaineers&quot;, stronger than the coastal peoples of Greece due to what he saw as their vigour born of a comparative lack of development and civilisation. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Dorians were imagined as an Aryan people, in line with other similar hypotheses about northern or Aryan invaders in the Near East. Hermann Müller argued in 1844 for the Nordic origin of Dorian (and so classical Greek) civilisation: this view became the standard in German historiography and remained so until the mid-twentieth century.

In 1870, Alexander Conze proposed that the recently identified Geometric style of pottery was the work of Dorian invaders, whom he considered to be a Germanic people from northern Europe. This view became the most popular scholarly interpretation of Geometric pottery for the remainder of the nineteenth century, though early objections noted the continuity between Mycenaean and Geometric styles and that Geometric pottery originated in Attica, which was not affected by the Dorian invasion in the mythological tradition; competing hypotheses developed that Geometric pottery was in fact a &quot;peasant style&quot;, originally predating Mycenaean culture, that it represented a mixture of northern-European styles with those of the Mycenaean period, or that it had in fact been brought from the Near East by the Phoenicians. Later, the Geometric style was divided from its earlier manifestation, the Protogeometric, used until the ninth century BCE; the Protogeometric was also argued to be Dorian in origin.

The paradigm of the Dorian invasion spread from German into British and French scholarship, though its tenets were rarely debated or developed outside France and Germany. Influential scholars such as William Ridgeway, and Sinclair Hood saw the ancient myths of the Dorian invasion and the Heracleidae as reflecting a historical migration of Aryan Dorians into Greece, although this interpretation conflicted with both ancient testimony and the understanding that the earlier Mycenaeans were themselves Greek. In France, Victor Duruy linked the Dorian invasion to the autocratic nature of the Spartan state, suggesting that it made Sparta ethnically homogeneous and so more acquiescent to repressive government.

=== Development and widespread adoption ===

In 1893, Karl Julius Beloch attempted to integrate the Greek historical tradition with recent archaeological discoveries, such as those made at Mycenae by Heinrich Schliemann and Panagiotis Stamatakis. Beloch considered the Dorians to have been indigenous to Mycenaean Greece and to have differentiated from them during the eighth century BCE. However, his views were generally rejected in favour of invasion-based narratives. In response to Beloch, Eduard Meyer called the invasion &quot;one of the few indubitably certain facts of earlier Greek history&quot;. Christos Tsountas and , in 1893 and 1937 respectively, posited it as the reason for the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces at the end of the twelfth century BCE. At the end of the nineteenth century, Paul Kretschmer argued that an early form of the Greek language had spread from Anatolia, rather than from northern Europe, but that during this spread these proto-Greeks had divided into several tribes, of which the proto-Dorians were the last to migrate into Greece.

Some of the cultural changes, such as the widespread adoption of cremation, created similarities between Greek culture and that of the Urnfield culture of central Europe, lending support to the view that the Dorian invaders had come from the north. Alan Wace and Maurice S. Thompson advocated the northern-origin theory in their 1912 book &quot;Prehistoric Thessaly&quot;. In 1921, Stanley Casson attempted to trace the routes of the Dorian invasion based on the finds of Geometric pottery, and concluded that both Sparta and a settlement at the Dipylon Gate of Athens were Dorian. Nicholas Hammond did likewise in 1934, arguing that the Dorians had entered Greece via the Pindus mountains of Albania, contrary to the accounts in ancient Greek historians, by which they universally originated within Greece.

During the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, the Dorian invasion paradigm remained dominant, partly as a result of the limited archaeological and historical evidence then available for the Greek world around and after the end of the Bronze Age. Carl Blegen, the excavator of the Mycenaean site of Pylos in Messenia from 1939, considered the site to have been destroyed by the Dorians, and adjusted his view of the date of Troy VIIa, which he believed to be the setting of the Trojan War, to make it compatible with this theory. He frequently discussed the Dorian invasion, among other then-current archaeological topics, in letters to Wace. The invasion became linked with other putative migrating peoples, known collectively as the Sea Peoples, mentioned in Egyptian and Near Eastern sources. Manolis Andronikos denied in 1954 that the Dorian invasion had happened; this view was considered &quot;drastic&quot; by John Myres, though Myres considered the archaeological and linguistic evidence for the invasion inconclusive, and that the mythical narratives surrounding it had been exaggerated by Greek settlers in Asia Minor. In 1956, Wace suggested that the invasion was historical, but that it had involved only political rather than cultural change, since he viewed Greek culture as broadly continuous between the Late Bronze Age and the classical period. 

From the 1960s onwards, linguistic arguments were advanced to support the Dorian invasion hypothesis. Certain common features of Arcadocypriot Greek, shared between Arcadia in the Peloponnese and the island of Cyprus, were held to be evidence that the two represented the remnants of a larger language group, broken up by the invading Dorians and including refugees who fled to Cyprus. The idea of the Dorian invasion remained the scholarly orthodoxy throughout the 1960s, and was adapted by Soviet historians, who integrated it into a Marxist view of history as the mechanism by which Greek culture transitioned from primitive communism to a mode of production based on slavery. In English-language scholarship, the focus of the debate became the effort to find material traces of the Dorians in Greek archaeological sites. Blegen stated in 1962 that &quot;the fire-scarred ruins of all the great [Mycenaean] palaces&quot; were &quot;the telltale track of the Dorians&quot;. 

During the 1960s, the Dorian invasion became connected with the nineteenth-century ideas of Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer, who had argued that modern Greeks were of Slavic ancestry rather than the descendants of classical Greeks; though Fallmerayer had dated this population replacement to the Byzantine period, his followers, such as Rhys Carpenter and Donald Nicol, saw the Dorian invasion as a similar point of discontinuity. The view of a break between Mycenaean and classical Greece was rejected in Greece itself: an updated 1970 edition of the &quot;History of the Greek Nation&quot; argued against it, as did a 1968 exhibition in Athens sponsored by the ruling military junta. One of the exhibition&#x27;s panels characterised the Dorians as &quot;the healthy powers of the [Greek] race&quot;. In 1980, Leonard Palmer defended the Dorian invasion hypothesis against recent criticisms, citing it as the only means of explaining the distribution of the West Greek dialects in the classical period. Robert Drews further defended it in 1988, writing that the Dorians conquered Greece by mastering new modes of warfare, to which the existing Mycenaean states failed to adapt.

== In German nationalism ==

After the Enlightenment, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Germans developed the Dorian invasion as part of the hypothesis, by which the German nation was imagined to have a preordained historical path and superior racial status. Building on developments in Indo-European studies, which reconstructed the linguistic connections between German, Greek and Sanskrit, the German language was considered to be particularly strongly associated with Greek, and German culture to be a continuation of that of ancient Greece. Germans were, under this paradigm, viewed as the &quot;new Dorians&quot;. From 1794 onwards, Friedrich Schlegel promoted a Romantic and idealised view of Sparta as a definingly Dorian society. For Schlegel, Sparta represented a racial and cultural ideal, characterised by successful social integration and respect for the rights and dignity of women. This admiration and emulation of Sparta became a prominent feature of German nationalist ideologies. 

Müller extended his archaeological theories about the Dorians to promote a &quot;Dorian way of life&quot;, based on his identification of the Dorians with the qualities of honour, liberty and patriotism. He argued that the god Apollo, whom he associated with the qualities of tranquillity, harmony and clarity, had been Dorian in origin. He contrasted this with Dionysus, whom he believed to embody the opposite qualities and to have entered Greek religion from Thrace. These ideas influenced the composer Richard Wagner, who used Müller&#x27;s view of the Dorians as a stand-in for his own belief in the enmity between Germany and its neighbours, particularly in France and Italy. Müller saw Dorian culture as prefiguring the hierarchical, autocratic, militarised German state of Prussia: this became, in the words of , &quot;a quasi-permanent temptation&quot; in German intellectual culture. His ideas became associated with Prussian militarism; by the 1930s, Müller, militarism and ancient Sparta were closely connected in German political culture, to a much greater extent than they had been in Müller&#x27;s own work.

In 1929, Hans Günther – an early supporter of the Nazi Party and major influence upon its racial theories – published &quot;Racial History of the Hellenic and Roman Peoples&quot; (), in which he argued that both the Greeks and Romans belonged to the Nordic race. Günther argued that references in ancient writers, such as Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, to the mythical Hyperboreans as the ancestors of the Dorians represented a genuine memory that the Dorians had come from the far north. He also adduced linguistic arguments, such as the fact that the Greek word means both &quot;rainbow&quot; and the iris of the eye, which he took as proof that the original speakers of Greek had had blue eyes rather than brown. In 1930, Alfred Rosenberg, a Nazi racial theorist and later war criminal, wrote of the Dorians as one of several waves of Aryan invaders into Greece, arguing that both Mycenaean and post-Mycenaean Greece, along with ancient Rome, were Nordic in racial character.

During the period of Nazi rule between 1933 and 1945, German classicists universally portrayed the Dorians, in the words of Richard Wolin, as &quot;fearless Aryan conquerors&quot;, contrasted with supposedly racially inferior Ionians. In the framing of Annie Schnapp-Gourbeillion, the Nazis cast the Dorian invasion as &quot;saving&quot; Greece from the &quot;contamination&quot; of Asiatic races. Through the Dorian invasion, they argued that classical Greece was fundamentally Germanic in nature, and that Nazi Germany, which modelled its militarism and state-organised militarised training of boys on Sparta, represented the best of classical Greek virtues. The Dorians were also imagined as having invaded Italy: a 1940 work published in Leipzig argued for &quot;indisputable connections&quot; between protohistoric sites in northern Italy and those of Prussia and Scandinavia. The work of Fritz Schachermeyr, a prominent Nazi historian and adherent of race theory, was particularly influential in entrenching the Dorian invasion in German-speaking scholarship. In February 1941, Adolf Hitler stated his belief that the Aryan race had only reached its apogee through its supposed invasion of Greece and Italy. 

The racialised view of the Dorians promoted in Nazi Germany was echoed by historians in other countries. Ioannis Koumaris, a German-trained anthropologist with a professorship at the University of Athens, concurred with Nazi views as to the primacy of race in historical events and social organisation, but argued that the Dorian migrations had been &quot;local movements&quot; within a heterogeneous Greek race. The fundamental aspects of the racialised view of the Dorian invasion were rarely denied, even by those opposed to Nazi rule and politics, such as the German exile Werner Jaeger and the French scholars Georges Dumézil and Charles Picard. Picard wrote in 1935 that the Dorian invasion had been &quot;no bad thing ... [since] it allowed Greek art to cross the mirages of the Asian spirit&quot;. Where Müller&#x27;s view of the Dorians as superior, civilising invaders was challenged, its critics, such as Gustave Glotz, rarely disputed the underlying paradigm of the invasion: instead, they portrayed the Dorians as barbaric, destructive forces. Schnapp-Gourbeillion writes of both Glotz and contemporary pro-Dorian scholars as having &quot;recreate[d] from scratch a past marked by its false rationality and its moralising aspects&quot;. Although &quot;Aryan&quot; and related terms largely disappeared from scholarship following the downfall of Nazi Germany in 1945, the underlying paradigm of heroic, migrating invaders remained into the 1960s, both in mainstream historiography and in explicitly right-wing and Neo-Nazi works.

== Criticism and replacement in archaeological scholarship ==

=== Early challenges to the hypothesis ===

The art historian Robert Cook has written that the association between the Dorians and Geometric pottery, despite its initial scholarly popularity, was never a comfortable fit with the evidence. In 1903, Hans Dragendorff challenged it, arguing that Geometric pottery was simply a development of Mycenaean styles: Dragendorff&#x27;s view became the scholarly consensus after it was demonstrated by Bernhard Schweitzer in a 1917 work. In 1939, Gaetano De Sanctis, an Italian classicist who had refused to swear allegiance to the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, wrote a history of early Greece in which he rejected Müller&#x27;s view of the Dorian invasion, and ascribed only a small historical role to the Dorians. The 1952 decipherment of Linear B indicated that Greek had been spoken in the Peloponnese since the Bronze Age, leading many scholars to abandon the Dorian invasion as a hypothesis.

From the 1960s onwards, new archaeological discoveries pushed into the Mycenaean period the chronological horizons of key cultural changes, such as the Naue II sword, the development of iron-working, the practice of cremation and the development of what became Geometric pottery. It also became clear that these were not universally found in supposedly &quot;Doric&quot; areas, and were often adopted piecemeal in a manner not easily explained by the migration of a conquering elite. Cook published an article in 1962 in which he called the Dorian invasion &quot;not a subject that is worth much study&quot;, citing the paucity of available evidence: he considered that the invasion probably did take place, but that it left no trace in the material record and that most elements of the mythical and historical tradition concerning it were unproven. Vincent Desborough, in 1964, demonstrated the chronological inconsistency between the widespread adoption of burial in cist graves () and the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces (). More broadly, archaeological studies in the 1960s moved away from migration as a dominant explanation for cultural change, leading in turn to the decline of the Dorian invasion and related hypotheses in mainstream scholarship.

In the 1970s, various scholars, particularly in the United Kingdom, revived Beloch&#x27;s argument that the Dorians had already been present in Greece during the Mycenaean period. John Chadwick argued that Special Mycenaean, a putative dialect of Mycenaean Greek posited by Ernst Risch in 1965, was an ancestral form of Doric Greek. The Dorian invasion was therefore recast as either a revolt by a previously subject population, or else only the last in a series of migrations. Desborough suggested that the Dorians had retreated from their initial invasion, thereby explaining the lack of evidence for their settlement after the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces, and returned in the Submycenaean period around 50–100 years later. Anthony Snodgrass alternatively considered it most probable that the Dorian invasion had occurred, but that the Dorians had used identical material culture to the Mycenaeans whom they replaced, and that the received tradition as to the location of Dorian settlement was unreliable.

In 1978, Klaus Kilian proposed the name &quot;Dorian Ware&quot; for a class of non-wheel-made pottery, now known as Handmade Burnished Ware, found in post-destruction layers of his excavation at Tiryns. He suggested that this pottery should be associated with Dorian invaders, to whom he attributed the site&#x27;s destruction. However, the same pottery was later found in layers predating the site&#x27;s destruction, and it is now considered to have been of local Mycenaean manufacture, or else the work of small immigrant populations, who may already have been present in Mycenaean society. Paul Cartledge, in 1979, defended the historicity of the Dorian settlement of Sparta, though noted that such a settlement could not have occurred prior to , and so was incompatible with the Greek myths of the Dorian invasion and of the Heracleidae. However, he also noted that no material-culture innovations were any longer attributed to the Dorians, writing that &quot;the Dorians, archaeologically speaking, do not exist&quot;. 

By the early 1980s, the reality of the Dorian invasion was widely doubted in scholarship. In 1978, Carol G. Thomas wrote that Chadwick&#x27;s linguistic argument was incompatible with the mythological tradition, and would imply that the Dorian invasion was a ethnogenesis myth created in the Iron Age. Noel Robertson wrote in 1980 that the veracity of the invasion was widely doubted, and that the only remaining evidence for it was the Greek mythical tradition, which he considered to be better explained as a later innovation. In 1982, Annie Schnapp-Gourbeillion called the Dorian invasion &quot;a spectre [haunting] historians of ancient Greece&quot;, and wrote that the archaeological evidence then available could support, at best, the hypothesis of &quot;a series of violent but limited raids&quot; rather than a theory of invasion followed by large-scale settlement. By the 1990s, the Dorian invasion was considered a myth by most scholars in the field, though it continued to have adherents, such as Birgitta Eder, Nicholas Hammond and Theodore Cressy Skeat, and remained prevalent in German-speaking scholarship.

=== Current views of the Late Bronze Age collapse ===
The theory that the Dorians invaded the Peloponnese or otherwise migrated there is now rejected as a &quot;scholarly mirage&quot;. It is generally agreed that the collapse of Mycenaean palatial civilisation is better explained by endogenous factors, such as social conflicts or the breakdown of the palaces&#x27; socio-economic model, possibly exacerbated by external causes such as natural disaster, disease, climate change and changing technologies. It is also considered doubtful whether the events of the end of the Bronze Age should be explained as a single, interconnected collapse, and that the &quot;collapse&quot; was largely limited to the regions, institutions and practices associated with palatial administration. Most regions of Greece were outside the control of palatial states in the Mycenaean period and saw continuity in their populations, culture and traditions. 

While population movements probably occurred at the end of the Bronze Age, neither the mythical tradition nor the archaeological evidence are compatible with a single large-scale migration of a coherent population of &quot;Dorians&quot; into the Peloponnese. Where movements of people are believed to have occurred, they seem to have resulted in net migration away from Mycenaean centres; the population of the areas previously considered to have been settled by Dorians appears to have declined sharply. Furthermore, these population movements, on a smaller scale than imagined by the Dorian invasion, are now recognised as part of a broader, multi-causal systems collapse, rather than as a monocausal explanation for the changes of the period. 

Although cultural and linguistic change did occur between the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age, different aspects of the changes occurred at different times and speeds and affected different regions, rather than occurring suddenly and simultaneously, as would be expected with a single large-scale movement of people. Cultural features previously believed to have been introduced by the Dorian invasion, such as iron-working, Protogeometric and Geometric pottery, cist graves and cremation, are now known either to have predated the palatial destructions or to have originated in areas of Greece, such as Attica and Euboea, which were not considered to have been affected by the invasion. More generally, modern scholarship has problematised the relationship between cultural forms and ethnic identity, corresponding to the decline of the culture-historical paradigm by which changes in material culture were generally explained by population transfer.

Modern scholarship explains the ancient narrative of the Dorian invasion as a rationalising myth, created as part of a process of ethnogenesis by Peloponnesian communities whose cultural forms gradually converged over time. Oliver Dickinson has written that the myths of the Dorian invasion are &quot;likely to have little relevance to what actually happened&quot;, citing the long span of time between the supposed events and the composition of the retellings that survive, as well as the distorting effect of contemporary politics, ideology and society upon any historical elements that may have existed in the narratives.

<text>In order to find a solution to the Cyprus dispute, which started in 1963, numerous plans and meetings in international arena were organized and eventually United Nations determined the solution to be &quot;bi-zonal and bi-communal federation&quot; based on the political equality of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot people. According to United Nations&#x27; 2004 Annan Plan for the reunification of Cyprus, the proposed United Cyprus Republic would consist of two constituent states, the Greek Cypriot State and Turkish Cypriot State (), which would be governed by Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots respectively.

== Law of necessity ==
Since the implementation of the Annan Plan was dependent on its approval by both communities, Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots were aware before the referendum that the rejection of the United Nations&#x27; Plan by one side would make it null and void and the status quo ante in the Cyprus Island would continue. Turkish Cypriots voted for the Plan whereas Greek Cypriots rejected it. The United Nations&#x27; 2004 plan, according to its own terms, became null and void. By the rejection of the plan, the establishment of a new state of affairs in the Island and the termination of the existing situation was prevented.

Though the United Nations&#x27; plan failed, it has some consequences in favor of Turkish Cypriots and their administration via &quot;law of necessity&quot; according to international law. After the referendum, most of the major international organisations (EU, UN via UN SG, OIC etc.) declared support to Turkish Cypriots.

Northern Cyprus started to become member of international organizations under the name &quot;Turkish Cypriot State&quot;. It is under this name that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

== Turkish Cypriot State in Organisation of Islamic Countries ==
In June 2004, Northern Cyprus became an observer member of Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) under the name &quot;Turkish Cypriot State&quot;. According to OIC, the settlement to the Cyprus Dispute is based on the inherent constitutive power of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot peoples, their political equality and co-ownership of the Cyprus Island.

== Turkish Cypriot State in Economic Cooperation Organisation ==
In October 2012, Northern Cyprus became an observer member of Economic Cooperation Organisation under the name &quot;Turkish Cypriot State&quot;. The first meeting of ECO that Turkish Cypriot State participated as observer country is the 20th Meeting of Council of Ministers (COM) of ECO

<doc id="620385" wikidata="Q1722865" url="?curid=620385" title="Toronto Phantoms">
<text>The Toronto Phantoms were a professional arena football team based in Toronto, Ontario. The team was a member of the Eastern Division of the National Conference of the Arena Football League (AFL). The team also previously operated in New York City and Hartford, Connecticut.

==History==

===New York CityHawks (1997–1998)===
The team began in 1997 as the New York CityHawks. Their name was a reference to the peregrine falcon, several of which make their nests on ledges high up on New York&#x27;s skyscrapers.

Despite the failure of the New York Knights in 1988, the AFL decided once again to make an effort to establish a team in the nation&#x27;s largest media market, and granted a franchise to the New York CityHawks prior to the 1997 season. The major circumstance that differentiated this situation from that of the Knights was that the CityHawks were owned by Madison Square Garden, while the Knights had been tenants at the Garden.

====Background====
The Arena Football League had intended to re-enter the New York market in 1997 by putting an expansion team in the New Jersey Meadowlands, located just across the Hudson River from New York City. Among the ownership of the new New Jersey Red Dogs were several ex-NFL players, most notably former New York Giant Joe Morris.

In response to the AFL&#x27;s placing a team in New Jersey, the Madison Square Garden ownership requested a team of its own. This request was granted by the league with only months to go before the beginning of the 1997 season, while the New Jersey team had been founded several months earlier. The CityHawks thus had only half the preparation time that the Red Dogs had going into both teams&#x27; initial season of 1997.

====On the field====
The CityHawks played poorly, winning only two of 14 games during their first season, despite being led by Head Coach Lary Kuharich, who had coached the Tampa Bay Storm to the league championship by winning ArenaBowl VII in 1993. Meanwhile, the cross-river Red Dogs, under Head Coach John Hufnagel, had charged out of the gate, winning 8 of their first 9 games, and setting a (then) league record by scoring 91 points in one game against the Texas Terror (a record which was surpassed in 2001 when the New York Dragons scored 99 against the Carolina Cobras). To illustrate the contrasting fortunes of the two teams: during the weekend of games that included June 20–21, the Red Dogs scored 91 points against Texas; the CityHawks scored only nine points in a loss to Tampa Bay.

In 1998, the CityHawks replaced Kuharich with veteran NCAA coach Chuck Shelton, who was taking his first Arena Football job. However, the team fared almost as poorly as they had done the first season, winning only 3 of 14 games.

====CityHawks fly away====
The Garden announced that the club would be transferred to Hartford, Connecticut for the 1999 season, would be renamed the New England Sea Wolves, and would play at the Hartford Civic Center, an arena also managed (although not owned) by Garden management.

====Legacy====
The CityHawks had several individual players of outstanding quality, most notably quarterback Mike Perez, kicker Mike Black, defensive specialist/kick returner Ron Carpenter, and all-around threat Connell Maynor. Maynor, a very interesting case, was primarily a quarterback by trade, but played wide receiver/linebacker for the CityHawks. One week in 1997, he won the award for the league&#x27;s top &quot;ironman&quot; (player who plays both on offense and defense, as six of eight players had to do at that time in Arena Football). As a quarterback, Maynor would later lead the Orlando Predators to a league championship by winning ArenaBowl XIV.

In addition, the CityHawks were the first AFL team to have different helmets for home and road games. In 1997, they wore their gold helmets at home, with black jerseys and gold pants; and wore the reverse on the road: black helmets, gold jerseys, black pants. In 1998, they adopted a one-color scheme, dressing in all black at home, and in all gold on the road.

===New England Sea Wolves (1999–2000)===

The New England Sea Wolves were in Hartford for two seasons, and were coached by Mike Hohensee, the former Albany Firebirds coach who has been the head coach of the Chicago Rush since that team&#x27;s inception in 2001 until its fold in 2009 following the folding of the original version and subsequent revival of the league. In 2000, the Sea Wolves posted the first winning record in franchise history (8–6). That season also saw the debut of offensive specialist Damian Harrell, who went on to blossom after the team moved on to Toronto, and has continued his fine career into the 2006 season with several outstanding years for the Colorado Crush.

The team did little better financially in New England than it had in New York, and was sold to new owners, who relocated it to Toronto after the 2000 season.

===Toronto Phantoms (2001–2002)===
The Toronto Phantoms marked an abortive attempt by the Arena Football League to enter Canada. The team was purchased by a group led by TD Securities Inc. investment banker, Rob Godfrey. The majority share of the team was owned by Rogers Communications alongside minority owners Ronnie Strasser, Peter Shoniker and Simon Serruya The group paid a reported $6–8 million for the franchise. The Phantoms played the 2001 and 2002 Arena seasons in Toronto, and were then disbanded.

All home games were played at the Air Canada Centre, also the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League, the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association, and the Toronto Rock of the National Lacrosse League. The team&#x27;s primary rival was the Buffalo Destroyers, located 80 miles south in Buffalo.

The Phantoms&#x27; logo included a Grim Reaper character whose scythe carried the word &quot;Toronto&quot; with the word &quot;Phantoms&quot; appearing over it. The name came from &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical that played at the Canon Theatre (then Pantages Theatre) in Toronto for nine years.
The name was also a nod to minority owner Ronnie Strasser, whose family owned Phantom Industries, a women&#x27;s hosiery company.

In 2001, the Phantoms posted a reasonable 8–6 record, winning the AFL Eastern Division Championship, and making the playoffs. They would beat the New York Dragons in the first round of the playoffs; however, they would lose to the Nashville Kats in the second round.

In 2002, they went 5–9, missing the playoffs. Following the season, Rogers announced that they were suspending operations of the franchise. The Phantoms drew an average of just 6,976 fans per game over their two seasons at Air Canada Centre. Six years later, Rogers entered into a five-year sharing agreement with Ralph Wilson to lease Wilson&#x27;s NFL Buffalo Bills to Rogers for an annual regular season game in exchange for cash, marking the return of American football to Canada, after a fashion.

Among the notable Phantoms players were Offensive Specialist Damian Harrell, fullback/linebacker Jermaine Younger, as well as defensive back/wide receiver Ty Law (unrelated to the NFL player of the same name). During their time in Toronto, these players were not widely recognized in an already congested sports market.

<text>Otto Karl Gessler (or Geßler) (6 February 1875 – 24 March 1955) was a liberal German politician during the Weimar Republic. From 1910 until 1914, he was mayor of Regensburg and from 1913 to 1919 mayor of Nuremberg. He served in numerous Weimar cabinets, most notably as &quot;Reichswehrminister&quot; (Minister of Defence) from 1920 to 1928.

==Early life==
Otto Karl Gessler was born on 6 February 1875 in Ludwigsburg in the Kingdom of Württemberg as the son of the non-commissioned officer Otto Gessler and his wife Karoline (née Späth). He finished school in 1894 with the Abitur at the &quot;Humanistisches Gymnasium&quot; in Dillingen an der Donau. He studied law in Erlangen, Tübingen and Leipzig and received his doctorate there in 1900. Initially, he worked for the judicial service of Leipzig. He then moved to Bavaria and served in various positions in the Bavarian justiciary (1903 clerk in the Bavarian Ministry of Justice, 1904 prosecutor in Straubing, 1905 &quot;Gewerberichter&quot; in Munich) before moving into public administration. In 1903, Gessler married Maria Helmschrott (died 1954).

==Political career==

===Empire and Weimar Republic===
Gessler was mayor of Regensburg from 1910 to 1914 and lord mayor of Nuremberg from 1913 to 1919. Because of reduced mobility due to a handicap he did not serve during World War I. He successfully headed the town administration of Nuremberg in the war years and contributed to the fact that there were no leftist takeovers in Nuremberg and Franconia the immediate aftermath of the war during the German Revolution of 1918-19.

Gessler was close to Friedrich Naumann and became one of the founders of the DDP in November 1918. In October 1919, he was appointed as &quot;Reichsminister für Wiederaufbau&quot; (Minister for Reconstruction) in the cabinet of Gustav Bauer. Gessler was not a staunch supporter of the new republic, describing himself as a &quot;republican by reason&quot; only.

After the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch in March 1920 he assumed the office of &quot;Reichswehrminister&quot; (Minister of Defence) from Gustav Noske who was forced to resign as a result of the putsch.

Gessler kept that position for the next eight years, despite numerous changes of government. As &quot;Reichswehrminister&quot; he worked closely with &quot;Chef der Heeresleitung&quot; Hans von Seeckt in setting up the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and turning it into a modern army. Gessler did not see his role as controlling the military, but rather in cooperating with the military command staff, which for its part viewed the Reichswehr&#x27;s position as an independent and autonomous &quot;state within the state&quot;. From 1920 to 1924, Gessler was also a member of the Reichstag.

Gessler played a key role in the 1923 German October. He and left-wing SPD premier of Saxony Erich Zeigner, an outspoken critic of the Wehrmacht, shared a mutual antipathy. Gessler and conservative elements considered the Saxon and Thuringian governments suspect due to their reliance on the Communist Party for a parliamentary majority. Tensions grew throughout August and September as public clashes increased and Gessler cut contact with Zeigner. In early October, he called for the federal government to exercise its emergency powers, granted in response to the ongoing economic crisis and occupation of the Ruhr, to depose the state government. In the interim, he handed executive power to the Wehrmacht commanders in the two states, who banned public gatherings and took control of the state police. At the same time, Gessler sought to avoid confrontation with the ultraconservative Bavarian government, who established a quasi-dictatorship in the latter months of the year and were known to be plotting a putsch against Berlin. The KPD were in fact planning a national uprising, and as preparation entered into coalition government in both Saxony and Thuringia alongside the SPD. However, after a joint conference in Chemnitz on 21 October indicated no desire for even a general strike among the left, plans were called off. Nonetheless, Chancellor Gustav Stresemann and the cabinet were swayed to Gessler&#x27;s side and approved action; the state was occupied by the Wehrmacht on 22 October.

Five days later, they demanded the formation of new governments in both Saxony and Thuringia without the Communists or else they would be deposed and Reich commissars installed to govern the states. While Thuringian premier August Frölich agreed to resign, Zeigner refused, stating that only the state parliament had the authority to force a change in government. The federal cabinet requested and received approval from President Friedrich Ebert on 29 October to depose him. This intervention, combined with the lack of action against the rebellious Bavarian government, led the SPD to threaten to quit cabinet. Gessler encouraged their departure, stating that their continued presence further incited the Bavarians to action; a &quot;negotiated solution&quot; could only be reached with them out of the picture. Historian Heinrich August Winkler described his stance as &quot;nothing less than a partial capitulation&quot; to the Bavarian regime. The SPD parliamentary group voted to withdraw from cabinet, and the rump minority government fell less than a month later, ending Stresemann&#x27;s tenure as Chancellor.

From October to December 1925, Gessler also served as provisional Minister of the Interior and in May 1926 was Vice-Chancellor of Germany for a few days. In January 1927, the DDP voted against working with the coalition of the cabinet of Wilhelm Marx. To retain his position as Minister of Defence, Gessler left the party.

After the accusation of financial anomalies in his ministry associated with the secret re-armament of the Reichswehr (also known as the The Lohmann Affair) Gessler was forced to resign in January 1928.

From 1928 to 1933, he was president of the &quot;Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge&quot; (&quot;German War Graves Commission&quot;) and of the &quot;Bund für die Erneuerung des Reiches&quot;. From 1931 to 1933, Gessler was president of the &quot;Verein für das Deutschtum im Ausland&quot; (VDA, today &quot;Verein für Deutsche Kulturbeziehungen im Ausland&quot;).

===After 1933===
After the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; of the Nazis in 1933, he retired from politics, in part due to ill health, and at first lived in seclusion at Lindenberg im Allgäu. Later in World War II, however, he became a member of the resistance group around Franz Sperr, had contacts with the Kreisau Circle, was included the resistance’s 1944 plans, and, in the event that the coup succeeded, was slated to be political commissioner in Military District VII (Munich) in the shadow cabinet of General Ludwig Beck and Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. He was named in documents of Claus von Stauffenberg and was arrested two days after the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler of 20 July 1944. He was detained and tortured at Ravensbrück concentration camp and then held at various Berlin prisons until his release in February 1945.

After the end of World War II, Gessler became involved in humanitarian organizations. In 1949, he became president of the Bavaria Red Cross (a post he retained until his death) and in 1950 president of the German Red Cross. He was instrumental in the post-war reconstruction of the organization, serving as president until 1952.

From 1950 to 1955, Gessler was member of the Bavarian senate.

==Death and legacy==
Gessler died on 24 March 1955 in Lindenberg im Allgäu. In 1958, his memoirs &quot;Reichswehrpolitik in der Weimarer Zeit&quot; were published posthumously.

The hospital in Lindenberg is named for Gessler.

<doc id="620390" wikidata="Q1182594" url="?curid=620390" title="Defender of the Crown">
<text>Defender of the Crown is a strategy video game designed by Kellyn Beeck. It was Cinemaware&#x27;s first game, and was originally released for the Commodore Amiga in 1986, setting a new standard for graphic quality in home computer games.

In 1987 it was ported to MS-DOS, the Atari ST and the Macintosh and a conversion was done for the Commodore 64. Later it was ported to the CDTV, CD-i and Atari Jaguar and conversions were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Amstrad CPC, Apple II and Intellivision. Unofficially a ZX Spectrum version was also made. A sequel, &quot;Defender of the Crown II&quot;, was released in 1993 for the CDTV and Amiga CD32. Two remakes have been released: &quot;Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Defender of the Crown: Heroes Live Forever&quot; in 2007.

==Gameplay==
The game is set in England in 1149 during the Middle Ages where, following the death of the king, different factions are fighting for territorial control.

The player assumes the role of a Saxon (Wilfred of Ivanhoe, Cedric of Rotherwood, Geoffrey Longsword, or Wolfric the Wild) and tries to fight off the Norman hordes and wrestle for control of England. Eventually, the player must fight for control of all territories, and potentially those controlled by other Saxons, if they have become antagonistic. The player must amass armies and fight for control of opponents&#x27; castles. The player may engage enemy armies in battle and loot or lay siege to opposing castles. Territories can also be won in the periodic jousting contests. From time to time the player may attempt to rescue a damsel in distress and can appeal for help from the legendary bandit Robin Hood.

The game&#x27;s strategy boils down to a war of attrition as the player tries to amass larger armies than their opponents and manages to attack their territories at the right time.

Due to financial strains, Cinemaware decided to release the initial version without all the features originally planned for because of their need for revenue. Some features were partially implemented, but were removed so the game could be shipped. Some additional features completed but never seen in the shipped game include flaming fireballs (launched via the catapult), more locations (more varied castles to attack), and more in-depth strategy. Some of these features were implemented in later versions of the game.

James D. Sachs, the primary artist for the game, showcased some of these features on the Amiga during interviews after the release of the game.

==Cover art==
The cover art of &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; was put together by Peter Green Design and painted by Ezra Tucker.

Randy McDonald was in charge of art direction, design, and production for Cinemaware&#x27;s first four games, and he explains in an interview that &quot;Peter Greene or I would do a sketch of generally what we wanted for each cover. I went to Western Costume in Hollywood, which for many decades was the giant in the costume industry there, and rented costumes for the types of &quot;look&quot; we had settled on for each cover. We hired models and brought them into Peter&#x27;s large photo studio, where we set them up in the costumes I had rented, posed as closely as possible to the way we wanted them to be illustrated.&quot;

The initial artist, according to Randy McDonald, was supposed to be Greg Winter, but the cover eventually went to Ezra Tucker.

==Versions==
The versions of &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot;, notably for DOS and the NES, resulted in an enormous loss in graphic and audio quality due to those systems&#x27; inferior abilities compared to the Amiga. But these versions featured more in-depth strategic elements compared to the unfinished original version. The Apple II, Atari ST, and Commodore 64 versions were done with better success, the II, Macintosh, and ST versions&#x27; graphics coming quite close to the Amiga version. A version for the Sharp X68000 was in development by Bullet-Proof Software but never released.

All versions:
* Amstrad CPC
* Atari ST
* Apple II
* Commodore 64
* Game Boy Advance
* Nintendo Entertainment System
* Macintosh
* DOS CGA (4 color) and EGA (16 color)
* ZX Spectrum (unofficial)
* CD-i
* iOS
* Android
* Atari Jaguar
* Intellivision

In 1989, the game became the second game to ship on CD-ROM, after &quot;The Manhole&quot;.

==Reception==
The first public demonstration of &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; occurred at the Los Angeles Commodore Show in September 1986, before its November release, and attracted a huge crowd. The game amazed those who saw it for the first time:

&quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; became a commercial hit. In 1989, &quot;Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; reported that it had been purchased by &quot;almost three-quarters of a million gamers worldwide&quot;. Sales had surpassed 1 million units by 2001.

&quot;Info&quot; gave the Amiga version four stars out of five, stating that its &quot;graphics have set new standards for computer games&quot;. The magazine praised the &quot;breathtaking&quot; animation and &quot;impressive&quot; color, but hoped that future Cinemaware games would improve on the &quot;adequate&quot; gameplay, which was &quot;the weak link&quot;. &quot;The Australian Commodore Review&quot; gave the Commodore 64 version of the game a total score of 96 out of 100, while &quot;Commodore User&quot; said that it was &quot;totally brilliant and one of the best games to date on the 64.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised the Amiga version of &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot;&#x27;s graphics and animation, calling the game &quot;a showcase program to demonstrate the power of the Amiga to your friends.&quot; Although the gameplay was not as complex as other strategy games of the time, the reviewer was still exceptionally pleased with Cinemaware&#x27;s first game. That year the magazine gave &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; a special award for &quot;Artistic Achievement in a Computer Game&quot;, but in 1990 and 1993, surveys of wargames in the magazine gave the game two-plus stars out of five.

&quot;Compute!&quot; also stated that &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; effectively demonstrated the Amiga&#x27;s graphics, but stated that its gameplay was oversimplified. &quot;CU Amiga&quot; stated that &quot;there are not many areas in which &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; could be improved ... the graphics are sophisticated with lush colours and visual effects.&quot; &quot;Amiga Format&quot; were less kind to the CD rerelease of the game, stating that it &quot;hasn&#x27;t stood the test of time simply because the gameplay is somewhat weak.&quot; Power Unlimited gave the CD-i version a score of 87% writing: &quot;Defender of the Crown is a very varied game. All sorts of things come your way, including tactics, action and romance. Graphically it is also beautifully put together. Too bad it runs quite slowly, like many other CD-I games.&quot;

&quot;The One&quot; magazine in 1991 rated the game four out of five stars for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; the 92nd-best computer game ever released.

==Reviews==

==Legacy==
&quot;Defender of the Crown II&quot; was published by Commodore International in 1993 for the CDTV and Amiga CD32.

After a string of successful games and game series, Cinemaware eventually went bankrupt. In 2000, however, Lars Fuhrken-Batista and Sean Vesce bought Cinemaware&#x27;s name and assets, and founded Cinemaware Inc., naming a remake of &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; for modern PCs as one of the reformed company&#x27;s first projects. The new version, titled &quot;Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown&quot; was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 (September 30), Xbox (October 6), and Windows (October 15). The new company also created &quot;Digitally Remastered Versions&quot; of classic Cinemaware games, including &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot;.

In February 2007, a second remake to the game called &quot;Defender of the Crown: Heroes Live Forever&quot; was released by eGames, who had acquired Cinemaware in 2005. &quot;Heroes Live Forever&quot; features many of the elements of the original game, including jousting and archery tournaments, raiding castles, rescuing princesses, and laying siege to enemy fortresses via catapult. A new addition to the game involved the use of Hero and Tactic cards during battles, giving the user&#x27;s army various upgrades during the on-screen melee.

During the second half of the 1980s, some games directly inspired by &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; were released. Among these was for example &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (Rainbow Arts, 1989).

The Danish band PRESS PLAY ON TAPE remixed the theme music of the game on their 2003 album &quot;Run/Stop Restore&quot;, replacing the instrumental tune with proper medieval-sounding lyrics.

<doc id="620393" wikidata="Q719205" url="?curid=620393" title="Tetsuya Komuro">
<text>is a Japanese musician, songwriter and record producer. He is recognized as the most successful producer in Japanese music history and has introduced contemporary electronic dance music to the Japanese mainstream. He was also a former owner of the disco Velfarre located in Roppongi, Tokyo.

In the Oricon singles chart of April 1996, he monopolized all the top 5 positions as the songwriter and producer, a world record. In 1995, he monopolized all top 3 positions of the copyright distribution rankings for the JASRAC Award, a record in Japan&#x27;s music history. At his peak as a record producer the artists he predominantly produced for came to be known as TK Family and at one time included Namie Amuro, hitomi, TRF, Tomomi Kahara and Ami Suzuki amongst others. As of 2008, records produced by him had sold more than 170 million copies, primarily in Japan. Total sales of the singles he has written exceed 42 million copies, making him the fourth best-selling lyricist in Japan.

== Life and career ==

=== 1979–1994: Early career and TM Network ===

His career started as a keyboardist for Speedway in 1979. In 1984, he created the TM Network with Takashi Utsunomiya and Naoto Kine. A year later, in 1985, his first solo work was the soundtrack &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; for the anime movie &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot;, and his band, TM Network, did the closing credits song &quot;Your Song&quot;. He subsequently composed other soundtracks such as &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot; and &quot;Seven Days War&quot;.

As a solo singer, Komuro released singles &quot;Running to Horizon&quot; and &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; in 1989. &quot;Running to Horizon&quot; topped the Oricon charts. &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; also topped the Oricon charts, beating out Seiko Matsuda&#x27;s &quot;Precious Heart&quot;. In 1989 and 1990, Komuro collaborated with Warren Cuccurullo.

As a composer and producer, Komuro wrote a song &quot;My Revolution&quot; for Misato Watanabe. The song received the Golden Award at 28th Japan Record Awards in 1986.

TM Network released single &quot;The Point of Lovers&#x27; Night&quot; on July 7, 1990. The single also topped the Oricon weekly charts, beating out Wink&#x27;s single &quot;Yoru ni Hagurete (Where Were You Last Night)&quot;.

TM Network changed its name to TMN in 1990. In 1991, he collaborated with X Japan drummer and pianist Yoshiki as V2. TMN disbanded in 1994.

=== 1994–1997: Success as a record producer ===
By the early 1990s, Komuro was spending much of his time writing songs for and producing many other musicians and bands. He was also an early pioneer of dance music in Japan, and came to stardom in the 1990s as producer with a long string of hits with artists such as TRF (TK Rave Factory), Tomomi Kahala, Namie Amuro, Ami Suzuki, hitomi, Ryoko Shinohara and H Jungle with t. In 1994, he composed the musical score to the Japanese anime film &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, based on the Capcom video game. Ryōko Shinohara recorded the theme song of the anime film, &quot;Itoshisa to Setsunasa to Kokoro Zuyosa to&quot;, with Tetsuya Komuro. The single of the theme song was released on July 21, 1994, and sold over two million copies on Oricon charts. This score was removed from the US release of the film.

He was mainly helped in this task by the mix engineers Pete Hammond and Dave Ford. Both were working for PWL, which was the home of the British producing team Stock Aitken Waterman. Not only that, &quot;TK&quot; is also credited for the rise to fame of Daisuke Asakura, a popular Japanese composer, keyboardist and music producer who began his major musical career as a backup keyboardist for TM Network. Asakura is reported to view Komuro as his &quot;Sensei&quot; or &quot;Teacher&quot;.

In 1997, he started his overseas career with the remix of the theme music for the soundtrack to the 1997 American film &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;, which Japanese MMA fighter Kazushi Sakuraba and English pro wrestler Johnny Smith later adopted as their entrance music.

=== 1998–2007: Following career ===

Komuro also released albums as a solo singer or musician and was involved in the bands Globe, Kiss Destination and Gaball. On December 31, 1998, his band Globe&#x27;s song &quot;Wanna Be A Dreammaker&quot; received the grand prix award at the 40th edition of Japan Record Award. In 1999, Komuro, Utsunomiya and Kine reunited under their old name of TM Network, and remain active to this day.

Komuro worked in collaboration with French keyboardist Jean Michel Jarre from 1998 to 2001. The duet wrote the theme song for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, &quot;Together Now&quot;, as well as several other tracks and remixes. He and Jarre also performed a concert on beaches in Okinawa on January 1, 2001.

=== 2008: Fraud ===
On November 4, 2008, Komuro was arrested and charged with fraud, for taking ¥500,000,000 in exchange for a promise to sell to a Hyōgo-based investor the copyright to his songs, which he had already sold to somebody else (which was Avex Group Holdings according to reports). Reportedly, he planned to use the money to pay a portion of his ex-wife&#x27;s alimony. He admitted the fraud at his trial in January 2009.

In March 2009, Masato Matsuura, president of the Avex Group Holdings, recovered the losses for the plaintiff, paid him extra ¥100 million in compensation and a further ¥48 million in delay damages. Matsuura also stated that Komuro will work at Avex in a company position directly under his control.

On May 11, 2009, Komuro received a suspended three-year prison sentence. According to the sentencing judge, Komuro&#x27;s acceptance of responsibility and the fact that restitution had been made greatly influenced the final sentence, and further went on to state that no good to society would come from Komuro&#x27;s imprisonment.

=== 2009–2020: Comeback ===
At the Avex Group Holdings&#x27; concert tour a-nation 2009, Komuro made a surprise appearance on August 22, 2009. He played a medley of his hit songs at the piano and later reunited on stage with his fellow members of the J-pop group globe, Marc Panther and his wife Keiko Yamada.

Komuro composed AAA&#x27;s double A-side single &quot;Aitai Riyū/Dream After Dream (Yume Kara Sameta Yume)&quot;. The single was released on May 5, 2010.

He composed almost all the songs on &quot;Love Songs&quot;, the 2010 album of Japanese pop-star Ayumi Hamasaki. He also composed the 2013 single &quot;Feel The Love&quot; by Ayumi Hamasaki.

In January 2018, Komuro announced his retirement from the music industry, following revelations of an affair he had with a nurse who had been taking care of his wife Keiko after her brain surgery.

In July 2020, Komuro once again returned to the industry producing singles for Ayumi Hamasaki &amp; Nogizaka46.

In February 2021, it was reported that Keiko&#x27;s divorce had been finalized.

<text>The Dresden school was a baroque Neo-Renaissance architectural style developed in Dresden, Germany, primarily by Gottfried Semper and Hermann Nicolai. The style is associated with European architects mainly from Germany and Italy who built buildings and later city villas in large numbers, but also synagogues and public schools. Semper built the Dresden Semperoper, with the panther-quadriga (chariot) by sculptor Johannes Schilling (1828–1910). Important sculptors were Ernst Rietschel and Ernst Julius Hähnel.
==Music==
The term is also used to describe the collective of musicians and composers who were based in the city from the middle 1600s. These included Johann Jakob Walther and Johann Paul von Westhoff, who influenced later German violinists such as Johann Sebastian Bach.

<doc id="620396" wikidata="Q501032" url="?curid=620396" title="Origin of language">
<text>The origin of language, its relationship with human evolution, and its consequences have been subjects of study for centuries. Scholars wishing to study the origins of language draw inferences from evidence such as the fossil record, archaeological evidence, contemporary language diversity, studies of language acquisition, and comparisons between human language and systems of animal communication (particularly other primates). Many argue for the close relation between the origins of language and the origins of modern human behavior, but there is little agreement about the facts and implications of this connection.

The shortage of direct, empirical evidence has caused many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study; in 1866, the Linguistic Society of Paris banned any existing or future debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the Western world until the late twentieth century. Various hypotheses have been developed on the emergence of language. While Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection had provoked a surge of speculation on the origin of language over a century and a half ago, the speculations had not resulted in a scientific consensus by 1996. Despite this, academic interest has returned to the topic in the early 1990s. Linguists, archaeologists, psychologists, and anthropologists have renewed the investigation into the origin of language with modern methods.

== Approaches ==
Attempts to explain the origin of language take a variety of forms:
* &quot;Continuity theories&quot; build on the idea that language exhibits so much complexity that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form; therefore it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among humans&#x27; primate ancestors.
* &quot;Discontinuity theories&quot; take the opposite approach, stating that language, as a unique trait that cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans, must have appeared fairly suddenly during the course of human evolution.
* Some theories consider language mostly as an innate faculty—largely genetically encoded.
* Other theories regard language as a mainly cultural system that is learned through social interaction.

Most linguistic scholars favor continuity-based theories, but they vary in how they hypothesize language development. Some among those who consider language as mostly innate avoid speculating about specific precursors in nonhuman primates, stressing simply that the language faculty must have evolved gradually.

Those who consider language as learned socially, such as Michael Tomasello, consider it developing from the cognitively controlled aspects of primate communication, mostly gestural rather than vocal. Where vocal precursors are concerned, many continuity theorists envisage language as evolving from early human capacities for song.

Noam Chomsky, a proponent of discontinuity theory, argues that a single change occurred in humans before leaving Africa, coincident with the Great Leap approximately 100,000 years ago, in which a common language faculty developed in a group of humans and their descendants. Chomsky bases his argument on the observation that any human baby of any culture can be raised in a different culture and will completely assimilate the language and behavior of the new culture in which they were raised. This implies that no major change to the human language faculty has occurred since they left Africa.

Transcending the continuity-versus-discontinuity divide, some scholars view the emergence of language as the consequence of some kind of social transformation that, by generating unprecedented levels of public trust, liberated a genetic potential for linguistic creativity that had previously lain dormant. &quot;Ritual/speech coevolution theory&quot; exemplifies this approach. Scholars in this intellectual camp point to the fact that even chimpanzees and bonobos have latent symbolic capacities that they rarely—if ever—use in the wild. Objecting to the sudden mutation idea, these authors argue that even if a chance mutation were to install a language organ in an evolving bipedal primate, it would be adaptively useless under all known primate social conditions. A very specific social structure – one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust – must have evolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on &quot;cheap signals&quot; (e.g. words) an evolutionarily stable strategy.

Since the emergence of language lies so far back in human prehistory, the relevant developments have left no direct historical traces, and comparable processes cannot be observed today. Despite this, the emergence of new sign languages in modern times—Nicaraguan Sign Language, for example—may offer insights into the developmental stages and creative processes necessarily involved. Another approach inspects early human fossils, looking for traces of physical adaptation to language use. In some cases, when the DNA of extinct humans can be recovered, the presence or absence of genes considered to be language-relevant—FOXP2, for example—may prove informative. Another approach, this time archaeological, involves invoking symbolic behavior (such as repeated ritual activity) that may leave an archaeological trace—such as mining and modifying ochre pigments for body-painting—while developing theoretical arguments to justify inferences from symbolism in general to language in particular.

The time range for the evolution of language or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of &quot;Homo&quot; (2.3 to 2.4 million years ago) from &quot;Pan&quot; (5 to 6 million years ago) to the emergence of full behavioral modernity some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that &quot;Australopithecus&quot; probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of great apes in general, but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of &quot;Homo&quot; some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (&quot;proto-language&quot;) as early as &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, while others place the development of symbolic communication only with &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (1.8 million years ago) or with &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, currently estimated at less than 200,000 years ago.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages, Johanna Nichols—a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley—argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in the human species at least 100,000 years ago. Estimates of this kind are not universally accepted, but jointly considering genetic, archaeological, palaeontological, and much other evidence indicates that language likely emerged somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa during the Middle Stone Age, roughly contemporaneous with the speciation of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

== Language origin hypotheses ==

=== Early speculations ===
 In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:
* &quot;Bow-wow&quot;. The &quot;bow-wow&quot;, or &quot;cuckoo&quot;, theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder, saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* &quot;Pooh-pooh&quot;. The &quot;pooh-pooh&quot; theory saw the first words as emotional interjections and exclamations triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise, etc.
* &quot;Ding-dong&quot;. Müller suggested what he called the &quot;ding-dong&quot; theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by humans in their earliest words.
* &quot;Yo-he-ho&quot;. The &quot;yo-he-ho&quot; theory claims that language emerged from collective rhythmic labor; that is, the attempt to synchronize muscular efforts resulting in sounds such as &quot;heave&quot; alternating with sounds such as &quot;ho&quot;.
* &quot;Ta-ta&quot;. The &quot;ta-ta&quot; theory did not feature in Max Müller&#x27;s list, having been proposed in 1930 by Sir Richard Paget. According to the &quot;ta-ta&quot; theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong—they occasionally offer peripheral insights—as naïve and irrelevant. The problem with these theories is that they rest on the assumption that once early humans had discovered a workable &quot;mechanism&quot; for linking sounds with meanings, language would automatically have evolved.

Much earlier, medieval Muslim scholars developed theories on the origin of language. Their theories were of five general types:
# &quot;Naturalist&quot;: There is a natural relationship between expressions and the things they signify. Language thus emerged from a natural human inclination to imitate the sounds of nature.
# &quot;Conventionalist&quot;: Language is a social convention. The names of things are arbitrary inventions of humans.
# &quot;Revelationist&quot;: Language was gifted to humans by God, and it was thus God—and not humans—who named everything.
# &quot;Revelationist-Conventionalist&quot;: God revealed to humans a core base of language—enabling humans to communicate with each other—and then humans invented the rest of language.
# &quot;Non-Committal&quot;: The view that conventionalist and revelationist theories are equally plausible.

=== Problems of reliability and deception ===
From the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is the fact that symbols—arbitrary associations of sounds or other perceptible forms with corresponding meanings—are unreliable and may as well be false. The problem of reliability was not recognized at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionary theorists.

Animal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal&#x27;s contented state. The signal is trusted, not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just cannot fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason—because they are hard to fake. Primate social intelligence is &quot;Machiavellian&quot;; that is, self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys, apes and particularly humans often attempt to deceive each other, while at the same time remaining constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves. Paradoxically, it is theorized that primates&#x27; resistance to deception is what blocks the evolution of their signalling systems along language-like lines. Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favor of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest. A peculiar feature of language is displaced reference, which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate &quot;here&quot; and &quot;now&quot;. For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an evolutionarily stable strategy. This stability is born of a longstanding mutual trust and is what grants language its authority. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot.

==== The &quot;mother tongues&quot; hypothesis ====
The &quot;mother tongues&quot; hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem. W. Tecumseh Fitch suggested that the Darwinian principle of &quot;kin selection&quot;—the convergence of genetic interests between relatives—might be part of the answer. Fitch suggests that languages were originally &quot;mother tongues&quot;. If language evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable signals—words—to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. So even if one accepts Fitch&#x27;s initial premises, the extension of the posited &quot;mother tongue&quot; networks from close relatives to more distant relatives remains unexplained. Fitch argues, however, that the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal growth of the human brain give the human-infant relationship a different and more extended period of intergenerational dependency than that found in any other species.

==== The &quot;obligatory reciprocal altruism&quot; hypothesis ====
Ib Ulbæk invokes another standard Darwinian principle—&quot;reciprocal altruism&quot;—to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve. &quot;Reciprocal altruism&quot; can be expressed as the principle that &quot;if you scratch my back, I&#x27;ll scratch yours&quot;. In linguistic terms, it would mean that &quot;if you speak truthfully to me, I&#x27;ll speak truthfully to you&quot;. Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom &quot;obligatory reciprocal altruism&quot; could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect. A further criticism is that language does not work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups do not withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting that information without expectation of reciprocity to anyone who will listen.

==== The gossip and grooming hypothesis ====
Gossip, according to Robin Dunbar in his book &quot;Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language&quot;, language does for group-living humans what manual grooming does for other primates—it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances on the basis of the principle: &quot;if you scratch my back, I&#x27;ll scratch yours&quot;. Dunbar argues that as humans began living in increasingly larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one&#x27;s friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable. In response to this problem, humans developed &quot;a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming&quot;—&quot;vocal grooming&quot;. To keep allies happy, one now needs only to &quot;groom&quot; them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming then evolved gradually into vocal language—initially in the form of &quot;gossip&quot;. Dunbar&#x27;s hypothesis seems to be supported by adaptations, in the structure of language, to the function of narration in general.

Critics of this theory point out that the efficiency of &quot;vocal grooming&quot;—the fact that words are so cheap—would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming. A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming—the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds—to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech.

==== Ritual/speech coevolution ====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by social anthropologist Roy Rappaport before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight, Jerome Lewis, Nick Enfield, Camilla Power and Ian Watts. Cognitive scientist and robotics engineer Luc Steels is another prominent supporter of this general approach, as is biological anthropologist and neuroscientist Terrence Deacon. A more recent champion of the approach is the Chomskyan specialist in linguistic syntax, Cedric Boeckx.

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a &quot;theory of the origins of language&quot;. This is because language is not a separate adaptation, but an internal aspect of something much wider—namely, the entire domain known to anthropologists as human symbolic culture. Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Language would not work outside its necessary environment of confidence-building social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for a nonhuman ape communicating with others of its kind in the wild. Not even the cleverest nonhuman ape could make language work under such conditions.

Advocates of this school of thought point out that words are cheap. Should an especially clever nonhuman ape, or even a group of articulate nonhuman apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalizations that do carry conviction—those they actually use—are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful, and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Oral and gestural languages consist of pattern-making whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world—they are a theoretical impossibility. Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if one can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society—namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called &quot;institutional facts&quot;) can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement. In any hunter-gatherer society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective &quot;ritual&quot;. Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human ritual, kinship, religion and symbolic culture taken as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component.

In a 2023 article, Cedric Boeckx endorses the Rappaport/Searle/Knight way of capturing the &quot;special&quot; nature of human words. Words are symbols. This means that, from a standpoint in Darwinian signal evolution theory, they are &quot;patently false signals.&quot; Words are facts, but &quot;facts whose existence depends entirely on subjective belief&quot;. In philosophical terms, they are &quot;institutional facts&quot;: fictions that are granted factual status within human social institutions From this standpoint, according to Boeckx, linguistic utterances are symbolic to the extent that they are patent falsehoods serving as guides to communicative intentions. &quot;They are communicatively useful untruths, as it were.&quot; The reason why words can survive among humans despite being false is largely down to a matter of trust. The corresponding origins theory is that language can only have begun to evolve from the moment humans started reciprocally faking in communicatively helpful ways, i.e., when they became capable of upholding the levels of trust necessary for linguistic communication to work.

The point here is that an ape or other nonhuman must always carry at least some of the burden of generating the trust necessary for communication to work. That is, in order to be taken seriously, each signal it emits must be a patently reliable one, trusted because it is rooted in some way in the real world. But now imagine what might happen under social conditions where trust could be taken for granted. The signaller could stop worrying about reliability and concentrate instead on perceptual discriminability. Carried to its conclusion, this should permit digital signaling—the cheapest and most efficient kind of communication.

From this philosophical standpoint, animal communication cannot be digital because it does not have the luxury of being patently false. Costly signals of any kind can only be evaluated on an analog scale. Put differently, truly symbolic, digital signals become socially acceptable only under highly unusual conditions—such as those internal to a ritually bonded community whose members are not tempted to lie.

Critics of the speech/ritual co-evolution idea theory include Noam Chomsky, who terms it the &quot;non-existence&quot; hypothesis—a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science. Chomsky&#x27;s own theory is that language emerged in an instant and in perfect form, prompting his critics in turn, to retort that only something that does not exist—a theoretical construct or convenient scientific fiction—could possibly emerge in such a miraculous way. The controversy remains unresolved.

=== Tool resiliency, grammar and language production ===
Acheulean tool use began during the Lower Paleolithic approximately 1.75 million years ago. Studies focusing on the lateralization of Acheulean tool production and language production have noted similar areas of blood flow when engaging in these activities separately; this theory suggests that the brain functions needed for the production of tools across generations is consistent with the brain systems required for producing language. Researchers used functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTDC) and had participants perform activities related to the creation of tools using the same methods during the Lower Paleolithic as well as a task designed specifically for word generation. The purpose of this test was to focus on the planning aspect of Acheulean tool making and cued word generation in language (an example of cued word generation would be trying to list all words beginning with a given letter). Theories of language developing alongside tool use has been theorized by multiple individuals; however, until recently, there has been little empirical data to support these hypotheses. Focusing on the results of the study performed by Uomini &quot;et al.&quot; evidence for the usage of the same brain areas has been found when looking at cued word generation and Acheulean tool use. The relationship between tool use and language production is found in working and planning memory respectively and was found to be similar across a variety of participants, furthering evidence that these areas of the brain are shared. This evidence lends credibility to the theory that language developed alongside tool use in the Lower Paleolithic.

=== Humanistic theory ===
The humanistic tradition considers language as a human invention. Renaissance philosopher Antoine Arnauld gave a detailed description of his idea of the origin of language in Port-Royal Grammar. According to Arnauld, people are social and rational by nature, and this urged them to create language as a means to communicate their ideas to others. Language construction would have occurred through a slow and gradual process. In later theory, especially in functional linguistics, the primacy of communication
is emphasised over psychological needs.

The exact way language evolved is however not considered as vital to the study of languages. Structural linguist Ferdinand de Saussure abandoned evolutionary linguistics after having come to the firm conclusion that it would not be able to provide any further revolutionary insight after the completion of the major works in historical linguistics by the end of the 19th century. Saussure was particularly sceptical of the attempts of August Schleicher and other Darwinian linguists to access prehistorical languages through series of reconstructions of proto-languages.

Saussure&#x27;s solution to the problem of language evolution involves dividing theoretical linguistics in two. Evolutionary and historical linguistics are renamed as diachronic linguistics. It is the study of language change, but it has only limited explanatory power due to the inadequacy of all of the reliable research material that could ever be made available. Synchronic linguistics, in contrast, aims to widen scientists&#x27; understanding of language through a study of a given contemporary or historical language stage as a system in its own right.

Although Saussure put much focus on diachronic linguistics, later structuralists who equated structuralism with the synchronic analysis were sometimes criticised of ahistoricism. According to structural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, language and meaning—in opposition to &quot;knowledge, which develops slowly and progressively&quot;—must have appeared in an instant.

Structuralism, as first introduced to sociology by Émile Durkheim, is nonetheless a type of humanistic evolutionary theory which explains diversification as necessitated by growing complexity. There was a shift of focus to functional explanation after Saussure&#x27;s death. Functional structuralists including the Prague Circle linguists and André Martinet explained the growth and maintenance of structures as being necessitated by their functions. For example, novel technologies make it necessary for people to invent new words, but these may lose their function and be forgotten as the technologies are eventually replaced by more modern ones.

=== Chomsky&#x27;s single-step theory ===
According to Chomsky&#x27;s single-mutation theory, the emergence of language resembled the formation of a crystal; with digital infinity as the seed crystal in a super-saturated primate brain, on the verge of blossoming into the human mind, by physical law, once evolution added a single small but crucial keystone. Thus, in this theory, language appeared rather suddenly within the history of human evolution. Chomsky, writing with computational linguist and computer scientist Robert C. Berwick, suggests that this scenario is completely compatible with modern biology. They note that &quot;none of the recent accounts of human language evolution seem to have completely grasped the shift from conventional Darwinism to its fully stochastic modern version—specifically, that there are stochastic effects not only due to sampling like directionless drift, but also due to directed stochastic variation in fitness, migration, and heritability—indeed, all the &quot;forces&quot; that affect individual or gene frequencies... All this can affect evolutionary outcomes—outcomes that as far as we can make out are not brought out in recent books on the evolution of language, yet would arise immediately in the case of any new genetic or individual innovation, precisely the kind of scenario likely to be in play when talking about language&#x27;s emergence.&quot;

Citing evolutionary geneticist Svante Pääbo, they concur that a substantial difference must have occurred to differentiate &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; from Neanderthals to &quot;prompt the relentless spread of our species, who had never crossed open water, up and out of Africa and then on across the entire planet in just a few tens of thousands of years... What we do not see is any kind of &#x27;gradualism&#x27; in new tool technologies or innovations like fire, shelters, or figurative art.&quot; Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the appearance of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa and the last exodus from Africa respectively). &quot;That leaves us with about 130,000 years, or approximately 5,000–6,000 generations of time for evolutionary change. This is not &#x27;overnight in one generation&#x27; as some have (incorrectly) inferred—but neither is it on the scale of geological eons. It&#x27;s time enough—within the ballpark for what Nilsson and Pelger (1994) estimated as the time required for the full evolution of a vertebrate eye from a single cell, even without the invocation of any &#x27;evo-devo&#x27; effects.&quot;

The single-mutation theory of language evolution has been directly questioned on different grounds. A formal analysis of the probability of such a mutation taking place and going to fixation in the species has concluded that such a scenario is unlikely, with multiple mutations with more moderate fitness effects being more probable. Another criticism has questioned the logic of the argument for single mutation and puts forward that from the formal simplicity of Merge, the capacity Berwick and Chomsky deem the core property of human language that emerged suddenly, one cannot derive the (number of) evolutionary steps that led to it.

=== The Romulus and Remus hypothesis ===
The Romulus and Remus hypothesis, proposed by neuroscientist Andrey Vyshedskiy, seeks to address the question as to why the modern speech apparatus originated over 500,000 years before the earliest signs of modern human imagination. This hypothesis proposes that there were two phases that led to modern recursive language. The phenomenon of recursion occurs across multiple linguistic domains, arguably most prominently in syntax and morphology. Thus, by nesting a structure such as a sentence or a word within themselves, it enables the generation of potentially (countably) infinite new variations of that structure. For example, the base sentence [Peter likes apples.] can be nested in irrealis clauses to produce [Mary said [Peter likes apples.]], [Paul believed [Mary said [Peter likes apples.]]] and so forth.

The first phase includes the slow development of non-recursive language with a large vocabulary along with the modern speech apparatus, which includes changes to the hyoid bone, increased voluntary control of the muscles of the diaphragm, and the evolution of the FOXP2 gene, as well as other changes by 600,000 years ago. Then, the second phase was a rapid Chomskian single step, consisting of three distinct events that happened in quick succession around 70,000 years ago and allowed the shift from non-recursive to recursive language in early hominins.
# A genetic mutation that slowed down the prefrontal synthesis (PFS) critical period of at least two children that lived together.
# This allowed these children to create recursive elements of language such as spatial prepositions.
# Then this merged with their parents&#x27; non-recursive language to create recursive language.

It is not enough for children to have a modern prefrontal cortex (PFC) to allow the development of PFS; the children must also be mentally stimulated and have recursive elements already in their language to acquire PFS. Since their parents would not have invented these elements yet, the children would have had to do it themselves, which is a common occurrence among young children that live together, in a process called cryptophasia. This means that delayed PFC development would have allowed more time to acquire PFS and develop recursive elements.

Delayed PFC development also comes with negative consequences, such as a longer period of reliance on one&#x27;s parents to survive and lower survival rates. For modern language to have occurred, PFC delay had to have an immense survival benefit in later life, such as PFS ability. This suggests that the mutation that caused PFC delay and the development of recursive language and PFS occurred simultaneously, which lines up with evidence of a genetic bottleneck around 70,000 years ago. This could have been the result of a few individuals who developed PFS and recursive language which gave them significant competitive advantage over all other humans at the time.

=== Gestural theory ===
The gestural theory states that human language developed from gestures that were used for simple communication.

Two types of evidence support this theory.
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the cortex that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman primates can use gestures or symbols for at least primitive communication, and some of their gestures resemble those of humans, such as the &quot;begging posture&quot;, with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.

Research has found strong support for the idea that oral communication and sign language depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-hemisphere lesion, showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language. Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.

Primate gesture is at least partially genetic: different nonhuman apes will perform gestures characteristic of their species, even if they have never seen another ape perform that gesture. For example, gorillas beat their breasts. This shows that gestures are an intrinsic and important part of primate communication, which supports the idea that language evolved from gesture.

Further evidence suggests that gesture and language are linked. In humans, manually gesturing has an effect on concurrent vocalizations, thus creating certain natural vocal associations of manual efforts. Chimpanzees move their mouths when performing fine motor tasks. These mechanisms may have played an evolutionary role in enabling the development of intentional vocal communication as a supplement to gestural communication. Voice modulation could have been prompted by preexisting manual actions.

From infancy, gestures both supplement and predict speech. This addresses the idea that gestures quickly change in humans from a sole means of communication (from a very young age) to a supplemental and predictive behavior that is used despite the ability to communicate verbally. This too serves as a parallel to the idea that gestures developed first and language subsequently built upon it.

Two possible scenarios have been proposed for the development of language, one of which supports the gestural theory:
# Language developed from the calls of human ancestors.
# Language was derived from gesture.
The first perspective that language evolved from the calls of human ancestors seems logical because both humans and animals make sounds or cries. One evolutionary reason to refute this is that, anatomically, the centre that controls calls in monkeys and other animals is located in a completely different part of the brain than in humans. In monkeys, this centre is located in the depths of the brain related to emotions. In the human system, it is located in an area unrelated to emotion. Humans can communicate simply to communicate—without emotions. So, anatomically, this scenario does not work. This suggests that language was derived from gesture(humans communicated by gesture first and sound was attached later).

The important question for gestural theories is why there was a shift to vocalization. Various explanations have been proposed:
# Human ancestors started to use more and more tools, meaning that their hands were occupied and could no longer be used for gesturing.
# Manual gesturing requires that speakers and listeners be visible to one another. In many situations, they might need to communicate, even without visual contact—for example after nightfall or when foliage obstructs visibility.
# A composite hypothesis holds that early language took the form of part gestural and part vocal mimesis (imitative &#x27;song-and-dance&#x27;), combining modalities because all signals (like those of nonhuman apes and monkeys) still needed to be costly in order to be intrinsically convincing. In that event, each multi-media display would have needed not just to disambiguate an intended meaning but also to inspire confidence in the signal&#x27;s reliability. The suggestion is that only once community-wide contractual understandings had come into force could trust in communicative intentions be automatically assumed, at last allowing &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; to shift to a more efficient default format. Since vocal distinctive features (sound contrasts) are ideal for this purpose, it was only at this point—when intrinsically persuasive body-language was no longer required to convey each message—that the decisive shift from manual gesture to the current primary reliance on &quot;spoken&quot; language occurred.
A comparable hypothesis states that in &#x27;articulate&#x27; language, gesture and vocalisation are intrinsically linked, as language evolved from equally intrinsically linked dance and song.

Humans still use manual and facial gestures when they speak, especially when people meet who have no language in common. There are also a great number of sign languages still in existence, commonly associated with Deaf communities. These sign languages are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The cognitive functions are similar and the parts of the brain used are similar. The main difference is that the &quot;phonemes&quot; are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing. (Compare the motor theory of speech perception.)

Critics of gestural theory note that it is difficult to name serious reasons why the initial pitch-based vocal communication (which is present in primates) would be abandoned in favor of the much less effective non-vocal, gestural communication. However, Michael Corballis has pointed out that it is supposed that primate vocal communication (such as alarm calls) cannot be controlled consciously, unlike hand movement, and thus it is not credible as precursor to human language; primate vocalization is rather homologous to and continued in involuntary reflexes (connected with basic human emotions) such as screams or laughter (the fact that these can be faked does not disprove the fact that genuine involuntary responses to fear or surprise exist). Also, gesture is not generally less effective, and depending on the situation can even be advantageous, for example in a loud environment or where it is important to be silent, such as on a hunt. Other challenges to the &quot;gesture-first&quot; theory have been presented by researchers in psycholinguistics, including David McNeill.

=== Tool-use associated sound in the evolution of language ===
Proponents of the motor theory of language evolution have primarily focused on the visual domain and communication through observation of movements. The &quot;Tool-use sound hypothesis&quot; suggests that the production and perception of sound also contributed substantially, particularly &quot;incidental sound of locomotion&quot; (&quot;ISOL&quot;) and &quot;tool-use sound&quot; (&quot;TUS&quot;). Human bipedalism resulted in rhythmic and more predictable &quot;ISOL&quot;. That may have stimulated the evolution of musical abilities, auditory working memory, and abilities to produce complex vocalizations, and to mimic natural sounds. Since the human brain proficiently extracts information about objects and events from the sounds they produce, &quot;TUS&quot;, and mimicry of &quot;TUS&quot;, might have achieved an iconic function. The prevalence of sound symbolism in many extant languages supports this idea. Self-produced &quot;TUS&quot; activates multimodal brain processing (motor neurons, hearing, proprioception, touch, vision), and &quot;TUS&quot; stimulates primate audiovisual mirror neurons, which is likely to stimulate the development of association chains. Tool use and auditory gestures involve motor-processing of the forelimbs, which is associated with the evolution of vertebrate vocal communication. The production, perception, and mimicry of &quot;TUS&quot; may have resulted in a limited number of vocalizations or protowords that were associated with tool use. A new way to communicate about tools, especially when out of sight, would have had selective advantage. A gradual change in acoustic properties, meaning, or both could have resulted in arbitrariness and an expanded repertoire of words. Humans have been increasingly exposed to &quot;TUS&quot; over millions of years, coinciding with the period during which spoken language evolved.

=== Mirror neurons and language origins ===
In humans, functional MRI studies have reported finding areas homologous to the monkey mirror neuron system in the inferior frontal cortex, close to Broca&#x27;s area, one of the language regions of the brain. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people&#x27;s behavior. This hypothesis is supported by some cytoarchitectonic homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca&#x27;s area.

Rates of vocabulary expansion link to the ability of children to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations. Such speech repetition occurs automatically, quickly and separately in the brain to speech perception. Moreover, such vocal imitation can occur without comprehension such as in speech shadowing and echolalia. Further evidence for this link comes from a recent study in which the brain activity of two participants was measured using fMRI while they were gesturing words to each other using hand gestures with a game of charades—a modality that some have suggested might represent the evolutionary precursor of human language. Analysis of the data using Granger Causality revealed that the mirror-neuron system of the observer indeed reflects the pattern of activity of in the motor system of the sender, supporting the idea that the motor concept associated with the words is indeed transmitted from one brain to another using the mirror system.

Not all linguists agree with the above arguments, however. In particular, supporters of Noam Chomsky argue against the possibility that the mirror neuron system can play any role in the hierarchical recursive structures essential to syntax.

=== Putting-down-the-baby theory ===
According to Dean Falk&#x27;s &quot;putting-down-the-baby&quot; theory, vocal interactions between early hominid mothers and infants began a sequence of events that led, eventually, to human ancestors&#x27; earliest words. The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their counterparts in other primates, could not move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed to be reassured that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing &#x27;motherese&#x27;—an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling, and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language developed out of this interaction.

In &quot;The Mental and Social Life of Babies&quot;, psychologist Kenneth Kaye noted that no usable adult language could have evolved without interactive communication between very young children and adults. &quot;No symbolic system could have survived from one generation to the next if it could not have been easily acquired by young children under their normal conditions of social life.&quot;

=== From-where-to-what theory ===

The &quot;from where to what&quot; model is a language evolution model that is derived primarily from the organization of language processing in the brain into two structures: the auditory dorsal stream and the auditory ventral stream. It hypothesizes seven stages of language evolution (see illustration). Speech originated for the purpose of exchanging contact calls between mothers and their offspring to find one another in the event they became separated (illustration part 1). The contact calls could be modified with intonations in order to express either a higher or lower level of distress (illustration part 2). The use of two types of contact calls enabled the first question-answer conversation. In this scenario, the child would emit a low-level distress call to express a desire to interact with an object, and the mother would respond with either another low-level distress call (to express approval of the interaction) or a high-level distress call (to express disapproval) (illustration part 3). Over time, the improved use of intonations and vocal control led to the invention of unique calls (phonemes) associated with distinct objects (illustration part 4). At first, children learned the calls (phonemes) from their parents by imitating their lip-movements (illustration part 5). Eventually, infants were able to encode into long-term memory all the calls (phonemes). Consequentially, mimicry via lip-reading was limited to infancy and older children learned new calls through mimicry without lip-reading (illustration part 6). Once individuals became capable of producing a sequence of calls, this allowed multi-syllabic words, which increased the size of their vocabulary (illustration part 7). The use of words, composed of sequences of syllables, provided the infrastructure for communicating with sequences of words (i.e. sentences).

The theory&#x27;s name is derived from the two auditory streams, which are both found in the brains of humans and other primates. The auditory ventral stream is responsible for sound recognition, and so it is referred to as the auditory &quot;what&quot; stream. In primates, the auditory dorsal stream is responsible for sound localization, and thus it is called the auditory &quot;where&quot; stream. Only in humans (in the left hemisphere) is it also responsible for other processes associated with language use and acquisition, such as speech repetition and production, integration of phonemes with their lip movements, perception and production of intonations, phonological long-term memory (long-term memory storage of the sounds of words), and phonological working memory (the temporary storage of the sounds of words). Some evidence also indicates a role in recognizing others by their voices. The emergence of each of these functions in the auditory dorsal stream represents an intermediate stage in the evolution of language.

A contact call origin for human language is consistent with animal studies, as like human language, contact call discrimination in monkeys is lateralised to the left hemisphere. Mice with knock-out to language related genes (such as FOXP2 and SRPX2) also resulted in the pups no longer emitting contact calls when separated from their mothers. Supporting this model is also its ability to explain unique human phenomena, such as the use of intonations when converting words into commands and questions, the tendency of infants to mimic vocalizations during the first year of life (and its disappearance later on) and the protruding and visible human lips, which are not found in other apes. This theory could be considered an elaboration of the putting-down-the-baby theory of language evolution.

=== Grammaticalisation theory ===
&quot;Grammaticalization&quot; is a continuous historical process in which free-standing words develop into grammatical appendages, while these in turn become ever more specialized and grammatical. An initially &quot;incorrect&quot; usage, in becoming accepted, leads to unforeseen consequences, triggering knock-on effects and extended sequences of change. Paradoxically, grammar evolves because, in the final analysis, humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood. If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, similar principles at work can be legitimately inferred among distant human ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established.

In order to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars, it is necessary to know which hypothetical sequences are plausible and which are not. In order to convey abstract ideas, the first recourse of speakers is to fall back on immediately recognizable concrete imagery, very often deploying metaphors rooted in shared bodily experience. A familiar example is the use of concrete terms such as &quot;belly&quot; or &quot;back&quot; to convey abstract meanings such as &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;behind&quot;. Equally metaphorical is the strategy of representing temporal patterns on the model of spatial ones. For example, English speakers might say &quot;It is going to rain&quot;, modelled on &quot;I am going to London.&quot; This can be abbreviated colloquially to &quot;It&#x27;s gonna rain.&quot; Even when in a hurry, English speakers do not say &quot;I&#x27;m gonna London&quot;—the contraction is restricted to the job of specifying tense. From such examples it can be seen why grammaticalisation is consistently unidirectional—from concrete to abstract meaning, not the other way around.

Grammaticalization theorists picture early language as simple, perhaps consisting only of nouns.p. 111 Even under that extreme theoretical assumption, however, it is difficult to imagine what would realistically have prevented people from using, say, &quot;spear&quot; as if it were a verb (&quot;Spear that pig!&quot;). People might have used their nouns as verbs or their verbs as nouns as occasion demanded. In short, while a noun-only language might seem theoretically possible, grammaticalization theory indicates that it cannot have remained fixed in that state for any length of time.

Creativity drives grammatical change. This presupposes a certain attitude on the part of listeners. Instead of punishing deviations from accepted usage, listeners must prioritise imaginative mind-reading. Imaginative creativity—emitting a leopard alarm when no leopard was present, for example—is not the kind of behaviour which, say, vervet monkeys would appreciate or reward. Creativity and reliability are incompatible demands; for &quot;Machiavellian&quot; primates as for animals generally, the overriding pressure is to demonstrate reliability. If humans escape these constraints, it is because in their case, listeners are primarily interested in mental states.

To focus on mental states is to accept fictions—inhabitants of the imagination—as potentially informative and interesting. An example is metaphor: a metaphor is, literally, a false statement. In &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Romeo declares &quot;Juliet is the sun!&quot;. Juliet is a woman, not a ball of plasma in the sky, but human listeners are not (or not usually) pedants insistent on point-by-point factual accuracy. They want to know what the speaker has in mind. Grammaticalisation is essentially based on metaphor. To outlaw its use would be to stop grammar from evolving and, by the same token, to exclude all possibility of expressing abstract thought.

A criticism of all this is that while grammaticalization theory might explain language change today, it does not satisfactorily address the really difficult challenge—explaining the initial transition from primate-style communication to language as it is known today. Rather, the theory assumes that language already exists. As Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva acknowledge: &quot;Grammaticalisation requires a linguistic system that is used regularly and frequently within a community of speakers and is passed on from one group of speakers to another&quot;. Outside modern humans, such conditions do not prevail.

=== Evolution-progression model ===

Human language is used for self-expression; however, expression displays different stages. The consciousness of self and feelings represents the stage immediately prior to the external, phonetic expression of feelings in the form of sound (i.e. language). Intelligent animals such as dolphins, Eurasian magpies, and chimpanzees live in communities, wherein they assign themselves roles for group survival and show emotions such as sympathy. When such animals view their reflection (mirror test), they recognize themselves and exhibit self-consciousness. Notably, humans evolved in a quite different environment than that of these animals. Human survival became easier with the development of tools, shelter, and fire, thus facilitating further advancement of social interaction, self-expression, and tool-making, as for hunting and gathering. The increasing brain size allowed advanced provisioning and tools and the technological advances during the Palaeolithic era that built upon the previous evolutionary innovations of bipedalism and hand versatility allowed the development of human language.

=== Self-domesticated ape theory ===
According to a study investigating the song differences between white-rumped munias and its domesticated counterpart (Bengalese finch), the wild munias use a highly stereotyped song sequence, whereas the domesticated ones sing a highly unconstrained song. In wild finches, song syntax is subject to female preference—sexual selection—and remains relatively fixed. However, in the Bengalese finch, natural selection is replaced by breeding, in this case for colorful plumage, and thus, decoupled from selective pressures, stereotyped song syntax is allowed to drift. It is replaced, supposedly within 1000 generations, by a variable and learned sequence. Wild finches, moreover, are thought incapable of learning song sequences from other finches. In the field of bird vocalization, brains capable of producing only an innate song have very simple neural pathways: the primary forebrain motor centre, called the robust nucleus of arcopallium, connects to midbrain vocal outputs, which in turn project to brainstem motor nuclei. By contrast, in brains capable of learning songs, the arcopallium receives input from numerous additional forebrain regions, including those involved in learning and social experience. Control over song generation has become less constrained, more distributed, and more flexible.

One way to think about human evolution is that humans are self-domesticated apes. Just as domestication relaxed selection for stereotypic songs in the finches—mate choice was supplanted by choices made by the aesthetic sensibilities of bird breeders and their customers—so might human cultural domestication have relaxed selection on many of their primate behavioural traits, allowing old pathways to degenerate and reconfigure. Given the highly indeterminate way that mammalian brains develop—they basically construct themselves &quot;bottom up&quot;, with one set of neuronal interactions preparing for the next round of interactions—degraded pathways would tend to seek out and find new opportunities for synaptic hookups. Such inherited de-differentiations of brain pathways might have contributed to the functional complexity that characterises human language. And, as exemplified by the finches, such de-differentiations can occur in very rapid time-frames.

== Speech and language for communication ==
A distinction can be drawn between speech and language. Language is not necessarily spoken: it might alternatively be written or signed. Speech is among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, albeit arguably the most natural one.

Some scholars, such as Noam Chomsky, view language as an initially cognitive development, its &quot;externalisation&quot; to serve communicative purposes occurring later in human evolution. According to one such school of thought, the key feature distinguishing human language is recursion, (in this context, the iterative embedding of phrases within phrases). Other scholars—notably Daniel Everett—deny that recursion is universal, citing certain languages (e.g. Pirahã) which allegedly lack this feature.

The ability to ask questions is considered by some to distinguish language from non-human systems of communication. Some captive primates (notably bonobos and chimpanzees), having learned to use rudimentary signing to communicate with their human trainers, proved able to respond correctly to complex questions and requests. Yet they failed to ask even the simplest questions themselves. Conversely, human children are able to ask their first questions (using only question intonation) at the babbling period of their development, long before they start using syntactic structures. Although babies from different cultures acquire native languages from their social environment, all languages of the world without exception—tonal, non-tonal, intonational and accented—use similar rising &quot;question intonation&quot; for yes–no questions. Except, of course, the ones that don&#x27;t. This fact is a strong evidence of the universality of question intonation. In general, according to some authors, sentence intonation/pitch is pivotal in spoken grammar and is the basic information used by children to learn the grammar of whatever language.

== Cognitive development and language ==
Language users have high-level reference (or deixis)—the ability to refer to things or states of being that are not in the immediate realm of the speaker. This ability is often related to theory of mind, or an awareness of the other as a being like the self with individual wants and intentions. According to Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002), there are six main aspects of this high-level reference system:
* Theory of mind
* Capacity to acquire non-linguistic conceptual representations, such as the object/kind distinction
* Referential vocal signals
* Imitation as a rational, intentional system
* Voluntary control over signal production as evidence of intentional communication
* Number representation

=== Theory of mind ===

Simon Baron-Cohen (1999) argues that theory of mind must have preceded language use, based on evidence of use of the following characteristics as much as 40,000 years ago: intentional communication, repairing failed communication, teaching, intentional persuasion, intentional deception, building shared plans and goals, intentional sharing of focus or topic, and pretending. Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities. Call and Tomasello&#x27;s research on chimpanzees supports this, in that individual chimps seem to understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beliefs. Many primates show some tendencies toward a theory of mind, but not a full one as humans have.

Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use.

=== Number representation ===
In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased. In another, the primatologist Tetsuro Matsuzawa attempted to teach chimpanzees Arabic numerals. The difference between primates and humans in this regard was very large, as it took the chimps thousands of trials to learn 1–9, with each number requiring a similar amount of training time; yet, after learning the meaning of 1, 2 and 3 (and sometimes 4), children (after the age of 5.5 to 6) easily comprehend the value of greater integers by using a successor function (i.e. 2 is 1 greater than 1, 3 is 1 greater than 2, 4 is 1 greater than 3; once 4 is reached it seems most children suddenly understand that the value of any integer &quot;n&quot; is 1 greater than the previous integer). Put simply, other primates learn the meaning of numbers one by one, similar to their approach to other referential symbols, while children first learn an arbitrary list of symbols (1, 2, 3, 4...) and then later learn their precise meanings. These results can be seen as evidence for the application of the &quot;open-ended generative property&quot; of language in human numeral cognition.

== Linguistic structures ==

=== Lexical-phonological principle ===
Hockett (1966) details a list of features regarded as essential to describing human language. In the domain of the lexical-phonological principle, two features of this list are most important:
* Productivity: users can create and understand completely novel messages.
** New messages are freely coined by blending, analogizing from, or transforming old ones.
** Either new or old elements are freely assigned new semantic loads by circumstances and context. This says that in every language, new idioms constantly come into existence.
* Duality (of Patterning): a large number of meaningful elements are made up of a conveniently small number of independently meaningless yet message-differentiating elements.

The sound system of a language is composed of a finite set of simple phonological items. Under the specific phonotactic rules of a given language, these items can be recombined and concatenated, giving rise to morphology and the open-ended lexicon. A key feature of language is that a simple, finite set of phonological items gives rise to an infinite lexical system wherein rules determine the form of each item, and meaning is inextricably linked with form. Phonological syntax, then, is a simple combination of pre-existing phonological units. Related to this is another essential feature of human language: lexical syntax, wherein pre-existing units are combined, giving rise to semantically novel or distinct lexical items.

Certain elements of the lexical-phonological principle are known to exist outside of humans. While all (or nearly all) have been documented in some form in the natural world, very few coexist within the same species. Bird-song, singing nonhuman apes, and the songs of whales all display phonological syntax, combining units of sound into larger structures apparently devoid of enhanced or novel meaning. Certain other primate species do have simple phonological systems with units referring to entities in the world. However, in contrast to human systems, the units in these primates&#x27; systems normally occur in isolation, betraying a lack of lexical syntax. There is new evidence to suggest that Campbell&#x27;s monkeys also display lexical syntax, combining two calls (a predator alarm call with a &quot;boom&quot;, the combination of which denotes a lessened threat of danger), however it is still unclear whether this is a lexical or a morphological phenomenon.

=== Pidgins and creoles ===

Pidgins are significantly simplified languages with only rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary. In their early stage, pidgins mainly consist of nouns, verbs, and adjectives with few or no articles, prepositions, conjunctions or auxiliary verbs. Often the grammar has no fixed word order and the words have no inflection.

If contact is maintained between the groups speaking the pidgin for long periods of time, the pidgins may become more complex over many generations. If the children of one generation adopt the pidgin as their native language it develops into a creole language, which becomes fixed and acquires a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. The syntax and morphology of such languages may often have local innovations not obviously derived from any of the parent languages.

Studies of creole languages around the world have suggested that they display remarkable similarities in grammar and are developed uniformly from pidgins in a single generation. These similarities are apparent even when creoles do not have any common language origins. In addition, creoles are similar, despite being developed in isolation from each other. Syntactic similarities include subject–verb–object word order. Even when creoles are derived from languages with a different word order they often develop the SVO word order. Creoles tend to have similar usage patterns for definite and indefinite articles, and similar movement rules for phrase structures even when the parent languages do not.

== Evolutionary timeline ==
=== Primate communication ===
Field primatologists can give useful insights into great ape communication in the wild. One notable finding is that nonhuman primates, including the other great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signallers&#x27; emotional and bodily states. Nonhuman apes seemingly find it extremely difficult to produce vocalisations in the absence of the corresponding emotional states. In captivity, nonhuman apes have been taught rudimentary forms of sign language or have been persuaded to use lexigrams—symbols that do not graphically resemble the corresponding words—on computer keyboards. Some nonhuman apes, such as Kanzi, have been able to learn and use hundreds of lexigrams.

The Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s areas in the primate brain are responsible for controlling the muscles of the face, tongue, mouth, and larynx, as well as recognizing sounds. Primates are known to make &quot;vocal calls&quot;, and these calls are generated by circuits in the brainstem and limbic system.

In the wild, the communication of vervet monkeys has been the most extensively studied. They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations. Many of these are used to warn other members of the group about approaching predators. They include a &quot;leopard call&quot;, a &quot;snake call&quot;, and an &quot;eagle call&quot;. Each call triggers a different defensive strategy in the monkeys who hear the call and scientists were able to elicit predictable responses from the monkeys using loudspeakers and prerecorded sounds. Other vocalisations may be used for identification. If an infant monkey calls, its mother turns toward it, but other vervet mothers turn instead toward that infant&#x27;s mother to see what she will do.

Similarly, researchers have demonstrated that chimpanzees (in captivity) use different &quot;words&quot; in reference to different foods. They recorded vocalisations that chimps made in reference, for example, to grapes, and then other chimps pointed at pictures of grapes when they heard the recorded sound.

=== &quot;Ardipithecus ramidus&quot; ===
A study published in &quot;HOMO: Journal of Comparative Human Biology&quot; in 2017 claims that &quot;Ardipithecus ramidus&quot;, a hominin dated at approximately 4.5 Ma, shows the first evidence of an anatomical shift in the hominin lineage suggestive of increased vocal capability. This study compared the skull of &quot;A. ramidus&quot; with 29 chimpanzee skulls of different ages and found that in numerous features &quot;A. ramidus&quot; clustered with the infant and juvenile measures as opposed to the adult measures. Such affinity with the shape dimensions of infant and juvenile chimpanzee skull architecture, it was argued, may have resulted in greater vocal capability. This assertion was based on the notion that the chimpanzee vocal tract ratios that prevent speech are a result of growth factors associated with puberty—growth factors absent in &quot;A. ramidus&quot; ontogeny. &quot;A. ramidus&quot; was also found to have a degree of cervical lordosis more conducive to vocal modulation when compared with chimpanzees as well as cranial base architecture suggestive of increased vocal capability.

What was significant in this study, according to the authors, was the observation that the changes in skull architecture that correlate with reduced aggression are the same changes necessary for the evolution of early hominin vocal ability. In integrating data on anatomical correlates of primate mating and social systems with studies of skull and vocal tract architecture that facilitate speech production, the authors argue that paleoanthropologists prior to their study have failed to understand the important relationship between early hominin social evolution and the evolution of our species&#x27; capacities for language.

While the skull of &quot;A. ramidus&quot;, according to the authors, lacks the anatomical impediments to speech evident in chimpanzees, it is unclear what the vocal capabilities of this early hominin were. While they suggest &quot;A. ramidus&quot;—based on similar vocal tract ratios—may have had vocal capabilities equivalent to a modern human infant or very young child, they concede this is a debatable and speculative hypothesis. However, they do claim that changes in skull architecture through processes of social selection were a necessary prerequisite for language evolution. As they write:

=== Early &quot;Homo&quot; ===
Anatomically, some scholars believe that features of bipedalism developed in the australopithecines around 3.5 million years ago. Around this time, these structural developments within the skull led to a more prominently L-shaped vocal tract. In order to generate the sounds modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; are capable of making, such as vowels, it is vital that Early Homo populations must have a specifically shaped voice track and a lower sitting larynx. Opposing research previously suggested that Neanderthals were physically incapable of creating the full range of vocals seen in modern humans due to the differences in larynx placement. Establishing distinct larynx positions through fossil remains of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and Neanderthals would support this theory; however, modern research has revealed that the hyoid bone was indistinguishable in the two populations. Though research has shown a lower sitting larynx is important to producing speech, another theory states it may not be as important as once thought. Cataldo, Migliano, and Vinicius report speech alone appears inadequate for transmitting stone tool-making knowledge, and suggest that speech may have emerged due to an increase in complex social interactions.

=== Archaic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; ===
Steven Mithen proposed the term &quot;Hmmmmm&quot; for the pre-linguistic system of communication posited to have been used by archaic &quot;Homo&quot;, beginning with &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; and reaching the highest sophistication in the Middle Pleistocene with &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; and &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;. &quot;Hmmmmm&quot; is an acronym for &quot;h&quot;olistic (non-compositional), &quot;m&quot;anipulative (utterances are commands or suggestions, not descriptive statements), &quot;m&quot;ulti-&quot;m&quot;odal (acoustic as well as gestural and facial), &quot;m&quot;usical, and &quot;m&quot;imetic.

==== &quot;Homo erectus&quot; ====
Evidence for &quot;Homo erectus&quot; potentially using language comes in the form of Acheulean tool usage. The use of abstract thought in the formation of Acheulean hand axes coincides with the symbol creation necessary for simple language. Recent language theories present recursion as the unique facet of human language and theory of mind. However, breaking down language into its symbolic parts: separating meaning from the requirements of grammar, it becomes possible to see that language does not depend on either recursion or grammar. This can be evidenced by the Pirahã language users in Brazil that have no myth or creation stories, no numbers and no colors within their language. This is to highlight that even though grammar may have been unavailable, use of foresight, planning and symbolic thought can be evidence of language as early as one million years ago with Homo &quot;erectus&quot;.

==== &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; ====

&quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; was a close relative (most probably a migratory descendant) of &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;. Some researchers believe this species to be the first hominin to make controlled vocalisations, possibly mimicking animal vocalisations, and that as &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; developed more sophisticated culture, proceeded from this point and possibly developed an early form of symbolic language.

==== &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; ====

The discovery in 1989 of the (Neanderthal) Kebara 2 hyoid bone suggests that Neanderthals may have been anatomically capable of producing sounds similar to modern humans. The hypoglossal nerve, which passes through the hypoglossal canal, controls the movements of the tongue, which may have enabled voicing for size exaggeration (see size exaggeration hypothesis below) or may reflect speech abilities.

However, although Neanderthals may have been anatomically able to speak, Richard G. Klein in 2004 doubted that they possessed a fully modern language. He largely bases his doubts on the fossil record of archaic humans and their stone tool kit. Bart de Boer in 2017 acknowledges this ambiguity of a universally accepted Neanderthal vocal tract; however, he notes the similarities in the thoracic vertebral canal, potential air sacs, and hyoid bones between modern humans and Neanderthals to suggest the presence of complex speech. For two million years following the emergence of &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, the stone tool technology of hominins changed very little. Klein, who has worked extensively on ancient stone tools, describes the crude stone tool kit of archaic humans as impossible to break down into categories based on their function, and reports that Neanderthals seem to have had little concern for the final aesthetic form of their tools. Klein argues that the Neanderthal brain may have not reached the level of complexity required for modern speech, even if the physical apparatus for speech production was well-developed. The issue of the Neanderthal&#x27;s level of cultural and technological sophistication remains a controversial one.

Based on computer simulations used to evaluate that evolution of language that resulted in showing three stages in the evolution of syntax, Neanderthals are thought to have been in stage 2, showing they had something more evolved than proto-language but not quite as complex as the language of modern humans.

Some researchers, applying auditory bioengineering models to computerised tomography scans of Neanderthal skulls, have asserted that Neanderthals had auditory capacity very similar to that of anatomically modern humans. These researchers claim that this finding implies that &quot;Neanderthals evolved the auditory capacities to support a vocal communication system as efficient as modern human speech.&quot;

=== &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; ===

Anatomically modern humans begin to appear in the fossil record in Ethiopia some 200,000 years ago. Although there is still much debate as to whether behavioural modernity emerged in Africa at around the same time, a growing number of archaeologists nowadays invoke the southern African Middle Stone Age use of red ochre pigments—for example at Blombos Cave—as evidence that modern anatomy and behaviour co-evolved. These archaeologists argue strongly that if modern humans at this early stage were using red ochre pigments for ritual and symbolic purposes, they probably had symbolic language as well.

According to the recent African origins hypothesis, from around 60,000 – 50,000 years ago a group of humans left Africa and began migrating to occupy the rest of the world, carrying language and symbolic culture with them.

=== Descended larynx ===

The larynx (or &quot;voice box&quot;) is an organ in the neck housing the vocal folds, which are responsible for phonation. In humans, the larynx is &quot;descended&quot;. The human species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls. Several deer species have a permanently lowered larynx, which may be lowered still further by males during their roaring displays. Lions, jaguars, cheetahs and domestic cats also do this. However, laryngeal descent in nonhumans (according to Philip Lieberman) is not accompanied by descent of the hyoid; hence the tongue remains horizontal in the oral cavity, preventing it from acting as a pharyngeal articulator.

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how &quot;special&quot; the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent. As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. He argues that Neanderthals and early anatomically modern humans could not have possessed supralaryngeal vocal tracts capable of producing &quot;fully human speech&quot;. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs—increasing the risk of choking while swallowing food—we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit—so it is claimed—must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact not seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare. Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as it is known emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was initially driven by selection pressures for speech, thus not excluding that it was selected for e.g. improved singing ability.

==== Size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering formant frequencies so that the voice sounds &quot;deeper&quot;—giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself. Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, adult human males would be expected to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. However, females outperform males in verbal tests, falsifying this whole line of reasoning.

W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in the human species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalizing to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.

=== Phonemic diversity ===
In 2011, Quentin Atkinson published a survey of phonemes from 500 different languages as well as language families and compared their phonemic diversity by region, number of speakers and distance from Africa. The survey revealed that African languages had the largest number of phonemes, and Oceania and South America had the smallest number. After allowing for the number of speakers, the phonemic diversity was compared to over 2000 possible origin locations. Atkinson&#x27;s &quot;best fit&quot; model is that language originated in western, central, or southern Africa between 80,000 and 160,000 years ago. This predates the hypothesized southern coastal peopling of Arabia, India, southeast Asia, and Australia. It would also mean that the origin of language occurred at the same time as the emergence of symbolic culture.

Numerous linguists have criticized Atkinson&#x27;s paper as misrepresenting both the phonemic data and processes of linguistic change, as language complexity does not necessarily correspond to age, and of failing to take into account the borrowing of phonemes from neighbouring languages, as some Bantu languages have done with click consonants. Recreations of his method gave possible origins of language in the Caucasus and Turkmenistan, in addition to southern and eastern Africa.

== History ==

=== In religion and mythology ===

The search for the origin of language has a long history in mythology. Most mythologies do not credit humans with the invention of language but speak of a divine language predating human language. Mystical languages used to communicate with animals or spirits, such as the language of the birds, are also common, and were of particular interest during the Renaissance.

Vāc is the Hindu goddess of speech, or &quot;speech personified&quot;. As Brahman&#x27;s &quot;sacred utterance&quot;, she has a cosmological role as the &quot;Mother of the Vedas&quot;. The Aztecs&#x27; story maintains that only a man, Coxcox, and a woman, Xochiquetzal, survived a flood, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and had many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a dove, were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.

In the Old Testament, the Book of Genesis (chapter 11) says that God prevented the Tower of Babel from being completed through a miracle that made its construction workers start speaking different languages. After this, they migrated to other regions, grouped together according to which of the newly created languages they spoke, explaining the origins of languages and nations outside of the Fertile Crescent.

=== Historical experiments ===

History contains a number of anecdotes about people who attempted to discover the origin of language by experiment. The first such tale was told by Herodotus (&quot;Histories&quot; 2.2). He relates that Pharaoh Psammetichus (probably Psammetichus I, 7th century BC) had two children raised by a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. When one of the children cried &quot;bekos&quot; with outstretched arms the shepherd concluded that the word was Phrygian, because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for &#x27;bread&#x27;. From this, Psammetichus concluded that the first language was Phrygian. King James IV of Scotland is said to have tried a similar experiment; his children were supposed to have spoken Hebrew.

Both the medieval monarch Frederick II and Akbar are said to have tried similar experiments; the children involved in these experiments did not speak. The current situation of deaf people also points into this direction.

=== History of research ===

Modern linguistics did not begin until the late 18th century, and the Romantic or animist theses of Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Christoph Adelung remained influential well into the 19th century. The question of language origin seemed inaccessible to methodical approaches, and in 1866 the Linguistic Society of Paris famously banned all discussion of the origin of language, deeming it to be an unanswerable problem. An increasingly systematic approach to historical linguistics developed in the course of the 19th century, reaching its culmination in the Neogrammarian school of Karl Brugmann and others.

However, scholarly interest in the question of the origin of language has only gradually been rekindled from the 1950s on (and then controversially) with ideas such as universal grammar, mass comparison and glottochronology.

The &quot;origin of language&quot; as a subject in its own right emerged from studies in neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics and human evolution. The &quot;Linguistic Bibliography&quot; introduced &quot;Origin of language&quot; as a separate heading in 1988, as a sub-topic of psycholinguistics. Dedicated research institutes of evolutionary linguistics are a recent phenomenon, emerging only in the 1990s.

<text>A military cadence or cadence call is a call-and-response work song sung by military personnel while running or marching. They are counterparts of the military march. Military cadences often take their rhythms from the work being done, much like the sea shanty. Cadences usually have a call and response structure in which one servicemember initiates a line, and the remaining servicemembers complete it, instilling teamwork and camaraderie.

==United States Military==
===The Duckworth Chant===
A V-Disc issued in 1944 credits the origin of &quot;The Duckworth Chant&quot; (also known ad &quot;Sound Off&quot;) to Private Willie Lee Duckworth of Sandersville, Georgia, an African-American soldier serving in the United States Army.

This original cadence was recorded as &quot;Sound Off&quot;:
This cadence, known as the &quot;Duckworth Chant&quot;, still exists with variations in the different branches of the U.S. military. Duckworth&#x27;s simple chant was elaborated on by Army drill sergeants and their trainees, and the practice of creating elaborate marching chants spread to the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy.

A musical version of the chant was recorded by Vaughn Monroe and His Orchestra (Voc.: Vaughn Monroe &amp; Chorus in New York City) on March 7, 1951. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-4113A (in USA) and by EMI on their His Master&#x27;s Voice label as catalog number B 10086.

A variant of that cadence was used in the 1949 film &quot;Battleground&quot; and in the 1981 film &quot;Taps&quot;, filmed at Valley Forge Military Academy and College in Wayne, Pennsylvania. It appears in two versions in the film, both ending in the same cadence.

===Jody calls===
In the United States, &quot;jody calls&quot; (also spelled &quot;jodie&quot;) are named for &quot;Jody&quot;, a mythical civilian whose comfortable lifestyle is contrasted with the austerity of military life. Common themes of jody calls include homesickness, the difficulties of military life, personal boasts, and loyalty.

==In other countries==
During the 2017 Venezuelan protests, a cadence sung by Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) officers which expresses wanting to kill protesters went viral: &quot;Quisiera tener un puñal de acero para degollar a un maldito guarimbero&quot; ().

==Collected cadences==

Some common cadences include:

* &quot;Blood on the Risers&quot;
* &quot;I Wish All the Girls Were&quot;
* &quot;Captain Jack&quot; (Army cadence)
* &quot;Yellow Ribbon&quot; (Army cadence)

As soon as 1952, the U.S. Army adopted &quot;The Army Goes Rolling Along&quot; as its service theme song, with the lyric &quot;count off the cadence loud and strong&quot; a reference to Duckworth&#x27;s cadence. Its melody and lyrics derive from the traditional &quot;When the Caissons Go Rolling Along&quot;.

The United States Marine Corps and US Naval Academy use a modified version of the rhyme &quot;Old King Cole&quot;, referencing Chesty Puller: &quot;Chesty Puller was a good Marine and a good Marine was he&quot;.

<text>A party system is a concept in comparative political science concerning the system of government by political parties in a democratic country. The idea is that political parties have basic similarities: they control the government, have a stable base of mass popular support, and create internal mechanisms for controlling funding, information and nominations.

The party system concept was originated by European scholars studying the United States, especially James Bryce, Giovanni Sartori and Moisey Ostrogorsky, and has been expanded to cover other democracies. Party systems can be distinguished by the degree of political fragmentation, proportionality of seats-to-votes ratio and barriers to entry to the political competition.

==Types of party systems==
Main classification of party systems is using the number of parties. Counting the &quot;effective number&quot; of parties is somewhat tricky since the decisions need to be made as to which parties shall be included into the count. Including all parties usually makes little sense: for example, in the 2005 United Kingdom general election 16 entities run candidates and 12 got seats in the parliament, however, no researcher would argue that UK at the time had a 16- or 12-party system. The practical choice would be between a two-party (Labour won 35% of the vote, Conservatives 32%), or three-party system (Liberal Democrats got 22%). Some researchers suggest to exclude parties with low percentage of votes (for example, Alan Ware recommends a 3% threshold), others, like Giovanni Sartori, suggest looking at the history of participation in the governments. The 2005 UK example will yield 3 parties if Ware&#x27;s definition is used and 2 parties if Sartori&#x27;s definition is chosen, since the Liberal Democrats almost never influenced the government formation.

The classification is based on the typology originally proposed by Jean Blondel (1968):
* One-party system: a system in which a single political party has the right to form the government, usually based on the existing constitution, or where only one party has the exclusive control over political power. Example: China
* Dominant-party system: a system where there is &quot;a category of parties/political organizations that have successively won election victories and whose future defeat cannot be envisaged or is unlikely for the foreseeable future&quot;. Example: Russia
* Two party system: a system where only two parties or alliances, typically placed either side of the center, have a realistic chance of forming a majority. Other parties are very minor or solely regional. Example: United States, United Kingdom
* Two-and-a-half party system where each of the two major political parties that stand apart on the political spectrum needs a coalition with a smaller &quot;half&quot; party for political control. Example: post-war Federal Republic of Germany until the end of the 20th century
* Multi-party system: a system in which multiple political parties have the capacity to gain control of government offices, separately or in coalition. Example: Sweden, Ireland
* Non-partisan system: a system of government or organization such that universal and periodic elections take place without reference to political parties. Example: Micronesia

Sartori splits the original Blondel&#x27;s &quot;one-party&quot; category into true one party (no other ones exist), &quot;hegemonic&quot; (other parties exist, but there is no practical competition), and &quot;predominant&quot;, where competition exists, but one party on a regular basis gets over 50% of the votes. He had also split the multiparty system into &quot;moderate pluralism&quot; (3–5 &quot;relevant&quot; parties) and &quot;extreme pluralism&quot; (6–8 parties) and introduced an &quot;atomized&quot; party system, where the political system is so fragmented that adding one more party does not affect the political process at all. The functioning of the moderate pluralism resembles the two-party rule: there are two camps separated in the political spectrum with established electorate, the competition occurs for the voters in the political center, the political forces are cetripetal. The &quot;polarized pluralism&quot; is different: &quot;anti-system parties&quot; position themselves at the fringes of the spectrum are detached from the center, so the parties in the center are left without a credible election threat. This results in deep political divisions, &quot;centrifugal forces&quot;, and &quot;irresponsible oppositions&quot; that do &quot;outbidding&quot; secure in their knowledge that they will not have to govern and thus can safely over-promise. Sartori declares that the 5-party threshold between moderate and extreme pluralism is not a cause of change, but a result of the process of elite accommodation in the moderate case and lack thereof in the extreme pluralism.

== Party systems by country or region ==

=== Europe ===

Democratic party systems in most European states have increasingly fragmented over time. That means that the number of relevant parties surged, while the average size declined. Hence, the effective number of parties increased.

==== European Union ====
The European Parliament has compared to other parliaments a higher number of political parties with 206, to reduce political fragmentation the parties are organized into 7 political groups. Two structures of party system have been identified in the European Parliament since its first universal direct election in 1979, albeit the main EU party groups remained the same:
* 1979–1994: a system split in two blocs on the left/right dimension, with the left bloc (Socialists, Communists and Greens) opposing a right bloc (Christian democrats, Liberals and Gaullists)
* 1994-onwards: a system in which the three central parties (the conservative EPP, the socialist PES and the liberal ALDE) have voted as much with each other as with their smaller allies, thus &#x27;governing&#x27; the system, and facing different oppositions from the left (European Left and Greens and leftist eurosceptics) and from the right (Gaullists, rightist eurosceptics and nationalists).

==== Italy ====
Italian party systems are usually considered only since the foundation of the Italian Republic (1946) as pre-fascist parties lacked a wide popular base.

The party system of the so-called &quot;First Republic&quot; (1948–1994), though based on a proportional electoral law, saw the dominance of the Christian Democracy (DC) and the &quot;conventio ad excludendum&quot; against the Italian Communist Party (PCI). DC and PCI together gathered around 85% of the votes on average. The system was thus a blocked bipolar system; governments were very short (in average lasting less than one year) and post-electoral, but the supporting parties and personnel could not change.
With time, some parties (especially the Italian Socialist Party, PSI) gained momentum, until reaching the role of government-making in the 1980s. The system was completely destroyed by the bribery scandals of Tangentopoli, which shattered DC and PSI.
According to Sartori, the two possible degenerations of proportionalism (fragmentation and lack of party discipline) were reduced by two factors: the strong role of parties (&quot;partitocrazia&quot;) and the polarization between Christian-democrats and communists. Therefore, the &quot;first republic&quot; saw a maximum level of 5 effective parties, with only one dominant party.

The so-called &quot;Second Republic&quot; party system (since 1994) bears the following characteristic marks:
* a majoritarian electoral law, introduced by referendum in 1993, which brought about a bi-polarization of the game (although limited by the 1/4 of votes still gathered proportionally)
* the birth of as personal party of Silvio Berlusconi, with a strong polarization effect
* the rise of new parties (the environmentalists Verdi and the autonomist Lega Nord since the late 1980s, Alleanza Nazionale through a reform of the post-fascist Italian Social Movement)
* the split of old parties (between reformed post-communist Democratic Party of the Left and neo-communists of Rifondazione Comunista; between left-wing and right-wing of old Christian Democrats and Socialists, siding with or against Berlusconi)
Though more fragmented in the number of parties, the system was bipolar in its functioning. With time, both sides saw a strengthening of coalitions (even if with ups and downs) and the birth of unified parties (the Ulivo federation and then the Democratic Party on the left, and the People of Freedom party on the right side).
The change in the electoral law in 2005 and the return to proportionality (although with a majority premium able to transform, in the lower chamber, the plurality in a 55% majority) did not bring about a return to collusion, while still leaving such prospect open for the future.

==== Germany ====

The 2009 Bundestag election in Germany was characterized by widespread public apathy and record low voter turnout. Weldon and Nüsser (2010) argue that it solidified a new stable, but fluid five-party system that they see as a defining feature of the emerging German political system. The three minor parties each achieved historical bests at the polls with steep losses for the two traditional Volksparteien. They report that the increased volatility and fluidity of the party system is structured along the left-right ideological spectrum with the parties divided into two major camps and vote-switching much more likely within the respective camps rather than between them.

The 2009 election also marked a devastating defeat for the SPD, leading some commentators to speculate about the end of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) as a &quot;catch-all party&quot; and, against the backdrop of recent poor performance of center-left parties all across Europe—perhaps even &quot;the end of social democracy&quot;.

The 2013 election saw the first time that the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) that had been represented in parliament since 1949 and formed part of government as a coalition partner to either SPD or CDU (Christian Democratic Union, the major conservative / center-right party) for almost all of the period from 1949 to 1998 and again from 2009 to 2013 fell below the 5% threshold for parliamentary representation. The same election also saw the rise of the &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; (AfD) party that ran on an anti-Euro platform and failed to enter parliament on their first federal election just barely with 4.8% of the vote.

After this election the second grand coalition between CDU and SPD since 2005 was formed. Prior to that Germany had only had one grand coalition that governed from 1966 to 1969, typically coalitions of one big and one small party at the federal level were used instead in a two-and-a-half party arrangement. Whether this shift proves temporary or permanent remains yet to be seen

==== Central and Eastern Europe ====
Four party systems have been identified in post-communist countries of Central-Eastern Europe:
* I system (late 1980s – early 1990s): dominated by the opposition between communists and anti-communists, i.e. from supporters and opponents of the old regime; spontaneous mass movements formed on idealistic bases and transformed into &#x27;umbrella parties&#x27;
* II system (early 1990s): opposition between winners and losers of the economic transition to a market economy. Anti-communist parties split and formed unstable coalition governments. Many parties, with a narrow political base, grew up
* III system (late 1990s): the social conflicts of market transition aggravated, and social-democratic post-communist parties took over. The party system concentrated, while electoral volatility was extremely high
* IV system (2000s): rise of a relatively stable and modestly concentrated party system, organized on a left-right dimension, including post-communist parties. Fragmentation did not rise again after the fall of many social-democratic parties from government.

==== Finland ====
Finland was a Grand Duchy controlled by Russia until 1918. Nationalistic demands from the peasants and workers for greater use of the Finnish language led to the first political party: the Finnish Party in 1860. In response, the Swedish-speaking aristocracy, landowners and businessmen formed their own political party. Thus emerged the first party system.

==== Greece ====
Following the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1974, the centre right New Democracy and centre left PASOK came to dominate the Greek party system. PASOK and New Democracy had a combined vote share of 80 percent or more in every election between 1981 and 2000.
Following the 2008 recession and the ensuing sovereign debt crisis in the country, the populist left Syriza came to challenge the dominance of PASOK and New Democracy, increasing its vote share in every election from 2009 until eventually winning power in 2015.

=== Switzerland===
Swiss Federal Assembly is organized by political groups.

=== Canada ===

==== Federal party systems ====
According to recent scholars, there have been four party systems in Canada at the federal level since Confederation, each with its own distinctive pattern of social support, patronage relationships, leadership styles, and electoral strategies. Political scientists disagree on the names and precise boundaries of the eras, however. Steve Patten identifies four party systems in Canada&#x27;s political history.

Clarkson (2005) shows how the Liberal Party has dominated all the party systems, using different approaches. It began with a &quot;clientelistic approach&quot; under Laurier, which evolved into a &quot;brokerage&quot; system of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s under Mackenzie King. The 1950s saw the emergence of a &quot;pan-Canadian system&quot;, which lasted until the 1990s. The 1993 election – described by Clarkson as an electoral &quot;earthquake&quot; which &quot;fragmented&quot; the party system — saw the emergence of regional politics within a four party-system, whereby various groups championed regional issues and concerns. Clarkson concludes that the inherent bias built into the first-past-the-post system has chiefly benefited the Liberals.
* The first party system emerged from pre-Confederation colonial politics, reached its zenith from 1896 to 1911, and lasted until the Conscription Crisis of 1917. It was characterized by local patronage administered by the two largest parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives.
* The second system emerged following the First World War, and reached its peak in the period between 1935 and 1957. It was characterized by regionalism and saw the emergence of several protest parties, such as the Progressives, the Social Credit Party, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.
* The third system emerged in 1963 lasted until 1983, and began to unravel thereafter. This period saw the traditional two parries challenged by a strong third party, the New Democratic Party. Campaigns during this era became more national in scope due to the advent of electronic media, and involved a greater focus on leadership. The dominant policy of the era was Keynesian economics. The Election Act of 1974 was introduced during this period, allowing candidates party affiliation to appear on ballots, therefore an increased importance of party labels. This led to a shift from a candidate-centred system to a party-centred system, resulting in party leaders and the label of the candidate to play a major role in the deciding factor for voters. Leon Epstein characterized Canada as a &quot;two-party plus&quot; system, as only the Liberal and Conservative Party could form government, with the NDP present but not winning many seats.
* The fourth party system began with the 1993 election, which saw the decline of the Progressive Conservatives and NDP and rise of the Reform Party of Canada and the Bloc Québécois, and eventually led to the PCs merging with the Reform-descended Canadian Alliance. It saw most parties move to one-member-one-vote leadership contests, and a major reform to campaign finance laws in 2004. The fourth party system has been characterized by market-oriented policies that abandoned Keynesian policies, but maintained the welfare state. It was the elections of both 1997 and 2000 that showed that there was significant transformation in Canada&#x27;s party system, showing they have undergone a transformation into a genuine multiparty system.

==== Provincial party systems ====
Party systems differ across Canada in each province, as different provinces have different priorities, and values for their residents. According to Jared Wesley and Clare Buckley, there are two ways of comparing provincial party systems in Canada: &quot;conflict intensity&quot;&quot;,&quot; which is the extent to which parties challenge each other on priorities and opinions, some party systems features more competition when it comes to party options; and competitiveness, a measure of how close the average election is in terms of outcome, an uncompetitive system would show dominance in one party but competitiveness is good in sense that it gives a better sense of democracy. This leads to what they determine are the two types of party systems that are common in provincial politics: centripetal party systems and centrifugal party systems.
* Centripetal party systems are most prevalent in Central and Atlantic Canada, due to regional, linguistic, religious, and ethnic cleavages. They are regions where typically one prominent party reigns. These regions are where the Liberal Party has remained a strong political force prominently for decades.
* Centrifugal party system which has been polarized to describe party systems such as those in Western Canada. Competition between various different parties with vast differences in ideologies and values.

Additionally, from elections based from 1960 to 1995, Wesley and Buckley concluded that there are four different classifications of a party system for each of the ten provincial party systems. These groupings of classifications have most likely changed since 1995, as there has been a rise in different political parties for different provinces since these times. The four categories include:
* One-party dominant: Alberta
* Traditional two-party: Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland
* Three-party: Ontario, Manitoba
* Polarized: British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Quebec, New Brunswick

There has been a growing separation between federal and provincial political party systems, resulting in a separation of political perspectives typically associated with specific parties therefore fewer provincial and federal systems are symmetrical. Provincial systems for example, are simpler, stable, and often reflect the cleavages of each province (such as language, religion, class and ethnicity).

==== Territorial party systems ====
Nunavut and the Northwest Territories do not have political parties, and instead operate under consensus government. All candidates run and are elected as independents, and the newly elected legislature decides which of its members will make up the executive council. Due to their smaller populations, many argue that the absence of political parties makes it easier for voters to decide the person they are voting for. Other argue that it makes it harder for voters to recognize the goals and priorities of candidates, and that the lack of an opposition makes it harder for identify issues during debates.

=== United States ===

The concept of the party system was introduced by English scholar James Bryce in &quot;American Commonwealth&quot; (1888).

&quot;American Party Systems&quot; was a major textbook by Charles Merriam in 1920s. In 1967 the most important single breakthrough appeared, &quot;The American Party Systems. Stages of Political Development&quot;, edited by William Nisbet Chambers and Walter Dean Burnham. It brought together historians and political scientists who agreed on a common framework and numbering system. Thus Chambers published &quot;The First Party System&quot; in 1972. Burnham published numerous articles and books.
Closely related is the concept of &quot;critical elections&quot; (introduced by V. O. Key in 1955), and political realignments. Realigning elections involve major changes to the political system, regarding the coalition of voters, the rules of the game, finance and publicity, party organization, and party leadership.

A political science college textbook explains:
:&quot;Scholars generally agree that realignment theory identifies five distinct party systems with the following approximate dates and major parties: 1. 1796–1816, First Party System: Jeffersonian Republicans and Federalists; 2. 1840–1856, Second Party System: Democrats and Whigs; 3. 1860–1896, Third Party System: Republicans and Democrats; 4. 1896–1932, Fourth Party System: Republicans and Democrats; 5. 1932–, Fifth Party System: Democrats and Republicans.&quot;

There have been at least six different party systems throughout the history of the United States:

First Party System: This system can be considered to have developed as a result of the factions in the George Washington administration. The two factions were Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists and Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republican Party. The Federalists argued for a strong national government with a national bank and a strong economic and industry system. The Democratic-Republicans argued for a limited government, with a greater emphasis on farmers and states&#x27; rights. After the 1800 presidential election, the Democratic-Republicans gained major dominance for the next sixty years, and the Federalists slowly died off.

Second Party System: This system developed as a result of the one party rule of the Democratic-Republicans not being able to contain some of the most pressing issues of the time, namely slavery. Out of this system came the Whig Party and Henry Clay&#x27;s American System. Wealthier people tended to support the Whigs, and the poorer tended to support the Democrats. During the Jacksonian era, his Democratic Party evolved from Democratic-Republicans. The Whig party began to break apart into factions, mainly over the issue of slavery. This period lasted until 1860.

Third Party System: Beginning around the time of the start of the Civil War, this system was defined by bitter conflict and striking party differences and coalitions. These coalitions were most evidently defined by geography. The South was dominated by the Democrats who opposed the ending of slavery, and the North, with the exception of some major political machines, was dominated by the Republicans, who supported ending slavery. This era was a time of extreme industrial and economic expansion. The Third Party System lasted until 1896.

Fourth Party System: This era was defined by Progressivism and immigration, as well as the political aftermath of the American Civil War. Northeastern business supported the Republicans while the South and West supported the Democrats. Immigrant groups were courted by both parties. The Fourth Party System came to an end around 1932.

Fifth Party System: This system was defined by the creation of the New Deal Coalition by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. This coalition supporting new social welfare programs brought together many under-privileged, working class, and minority groups including unions, Catholics, and Jews. It also attracted African-Americans, who had previously largely supported the Republican Party due to Lincoln&#x27;s freeing of the slaves. This era lasted approximately until early-mid 1970s.

Sixth Party System: The transition to this system appears to have begun with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the Democrats subsequently losing their long dominance of the South in the late 1960s, with the GOP adopting the southern strategy leading to Republican dominance as evidenced by election results.

=== Argentina ===
Scholars of Argentina identify two distinct party systems, one in place between 1912 and 1940, the other emerging after 1946. The first party system was not consistently class based, but the second was, with the Radical Party representing the middle classes and the Peronists, workers and the poor.

<text>James Barron (September 15, 1768 – April 21, 1851) was an officer in the United States Navy. He served in the Quasi-War and the Barbary Wars, during which he commanded a number of famous ships, including and . As commander of the frigate , he was involved in the &quot;Chesapeake–Leopard&quot; affair in 1807 which led to the surrender of his ship to the British and resulted in him being court-martialed for his actions during the incident. After criticism from some fellow officers, the resulting controversy led Barron to a duel with Stephen Decatur, one of the officers who presided over his court-martial. Suspended from command, he pursued commercial interests in Europe during the War of 1812. Barron finished his naval career on shore duty, becoming the Navy&#x27;s senior officer in 1839.

==Early life==

Barron was born in Hampton, Virginia, the son of a merchant captain named James Barron who became Commodore of the tiny Virginia State Navy during the American Revolution. He was a younger brother of Samuel Barron. As a boy, Barron served as an apprentice in with his father for several years and entered the navy as a lieutenant and served aboard &quot;United States&quot; under John Barry. For his exceptional ability and service Barron was promoted to captain in 1799.

==Military career==
On March 9, 1798, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the newly created United States Navy. Barron demonstrated superior seamanship abilities as an officer of the frigate . Two years later, he was promoted to captain and commanded the sloop-of-war during the final months of the Quasi-War with France.

In a letter dated 13 August, 1802 he was ordered to take command of at the Washington Navy Yard.

Early in 1804 Barron supervised the building of gunboats at Hampton, Virginia. Barron was given command of on April 11, 1804, during the First Barbary War and sailed to the Mediterranean to serve in the squadron commanded by his brother, Commodore Samuel Barron, protecting American merchantmen and blockading the Tripolian harbor until May 22, 1805. Because of health problems he relinquished command of the squadron to Commodore John Rodgers.

On June 25, 1805, Barron, along with Stephen Decatur and others, presided over the court of inquiry, held aboard at Syracuse, which looked into William Bainbridge&#x27;s grounding and loss of near Tripoli&#x27;s harbor.

On April 15, 1806, he was appointed to the command of the Mediterranean Squadron. Barron obtained the rank of commodore on April 22 and was assigned command of the following year. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was berthed at Norfolk and was outfitted for her upcoming mission in great haste with a green crew and equipment that was below standards.

Barron commanded the frigate &quot;Chesapeake&quot; as a commodore. On June 22, 1807, his ship was involved in the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; affair, an engagement that resulted in the defeat and capture of Barron&#x27;s ship, one in a long line of such British incursions. The British ship of the line hailed his frigate outside of Hampton Roads and asked to search for British Navy deserters. Barron refused. &quot;Leopard&quot; then opened fire on &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, killing three crewmen and wounding eighteen. Caught completely unprepared for battle, Barron surrendered. A British party boarded his ship and took away four alleged deserters.

In January 1808, a court-martial was held, and Barron was convicted of not preparing his ship in advance for possible action, and was suspended for five years without pay. John Rodgers was the president of the court-martial, and Stephen Decatur was a member.

==Duel between Barron and Decatur==

After being away for six years, Barron finally returned from Copenhagen seeking reinstatement, but he remained controversial and was criticized by some of his fellow officers. Commodore Stephen Decatur, a former subordinate, was one of the most vocal. Barron became embittered towards Decatur and challenged him to a duel with pistols, which they fought on March 22, 1820.

Barron&#x27;s challenge to Decatur occurred during a period when duels between officers were so common that it was creating a shortage of experienced officers, forcing the War Department to threaten to discharge those who attempted to pursue the practice.

The duel was arranged by Bainbridge with Jesse Elliott in such a way that made the wounding or death of both duelists very likely. The duelists would be standing face to face in proximity to each other; there would be no back-to-back pacing away and turning to fire, the practice of which often resulted in the missing of one&#x27;s opponent. After taking their places Barron and Decatur were instructed by Bainbridge, &quot;I shall give the word quickly – &#x27;Present, one, two, three&#x27; – You are neither to fire before the word &#x27;one&#x27;, nor after the word &#x27;three&#x27;.&quot; Now in their positions, each duelist raised his pistol, cocked the flintlock and waited for the call where Bainbridge then called out, &#x27;One&#x27;, Decatur and Barron both firing before the count of &#x27;two&#x27;. Decatur&#x27;s shot hit Barron in the lower abdomen and ricocheted into his thigh. Barron&#x27;s shot hit Decatur in the pelvic area, severing arteries. Both of the duelists fell almost at the same instant. Decatur, mortally wounded and clutching his side, exclaimed, &quot;Oh, Lord, I am a dead man.&quot; Lying wounded, Commodore Barron proclaimed that the duel was carried out properly and honorably and told Decatur that he forgave him from the bottom of his heart. Decatur died from his wounds at approximately 10:30 pm that night while Barron survived his.

==Later service==
Barron remained in the Navy on shore duty, becoming the Navy&#x27;s senior officer in 1839. He died in Norfolk, Virginia, on April 21, 1851. His personal papers, which primarily relate to the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; affair, can be found in the Special Collections Research Center at the College of William &amp; Mary.

<text>Witness protection is security provided to a threatened person providing testimonial evidence to the justice system, including defendants and other clients, before, during, and after trials, usually by police. While witnesses may only require protection until the conclusion of a trial, in particularly extreme cases, some witnesses are provided with new identities and may live out the rest of their lives under government protection. Protection is typically needed when their safety is at risk due to the potential for retaliation. The program aims to ensure their safety and encourage them to cooperate with law enforcement by providing information that can help solve cases and bring criminals to justice. It is an important tool in maintaining the integrity of the justice system and protecting those who are willing to come forward with crucial information.

Witness protection is usually required in trials against organized crime, where law enforcement sees a risk for witnesses to be intimidated by colleagues of defendants. It is also used at war crime, espionage and national security issues trials.

==Witness protection by country==
Not all countries have formal witness protection programs; instead, local police may implement informal protection as the need arises in specific cases. The programs provide support, sometime even including financial support and counseling, to help witnesses rebuild their lives. It&#x27;s an important measure in safeguarding the well-being of those who come forward to assist in the pursuit of justice.

===Australia===
The Australian Federal Police administers the National Witness Protection Program under The National Witness Protection Act 1994, which delivers protection and assistance to witnesses and others identified as being at risk. Not all witnesses are eligible for the Witness Protection Program. The decision to admit a witness into the program is made on a case-by-case basis and involves a rigorous assessment process.

===Canada===
Canada&#x27;s Witness Protection Program Act received royal assent on June 20, 1996. The program is run by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), with support by all levels of government and police forces. The program takes into account the unique circumstances of each case and tailors its approach to meet the specific needs of the witness and their situation. Similar to other countries, the WPP provides participants with new identities, including new name and documents. It also offers relocation assistance to ensure their safety.

===Hong Kong ===

Several departments of the Security Bureau of Hong Kong have specialized units to provide protection for witnesses and their families who face threats to their life. Notable units include the Witness Protection Unit (WPU) of the Hong Kong Police Force, the Witness Protection and Firearms Section (R4) of the ICAC, and the WPU of the Hong Kong Customs.

The members of these units undergo training in protection, firearms, self-defence, physical and tactical training. They are mostly trained in the use of, and issued, the Glock 19 compact handgun as sidearm. The standard Glock 17 or the long arms such as the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 sub-machine gun or the Remington Model 870 shotgun may be issued if the witness faces bigger threats. A new identity could be given to a witness, and the government may relocate them far from Hong Kong if the witness is still being threatened after the end of the trial.

===Indonesia===
In 2006, Indonesia enacted the Law n. 13 on Witness and Victim Protection, which introduced for the first time the legal qualifications of witness, (crimes) victim, complainant and justice collaborator within the Indonesian Criminal Procedure Code (KUHAP). In Indonesia, justice collaborators play an important role especially for the activities of the Corruption Eradication Commission, since &quot;corruption in Indonesia is committed collectively&quot;.

===Ireland===
The Witness Security Programme in Ireland is administered by the Attorney General of Ireland, and is operated by the elite Special Detective Unit (SDU) of the &quot;Garda Síochána&quot;, the national police force. The programme was officially established in 1997, following the assassination of journalist Veronica Guerin by a drugs gang she was reporting on. Witnesses in the program are given a new identity, address and armed police protection either in Ireland or abroad (generally in Anglophone countries). They are usually provided with financial assistance, as witnesses regularly must leave their previous employment. Witness protection is used in cases of serious, organised crime and terrorism. The Irish Government will only grant protection to those who cooperate with investigations conducted by the &quot;Garda Síochána&quot;. Court appearances by witnesses in protection are carried out under the security of the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), the highest-tier special weapons and tactical operations group in Irish law enforcement. There has never been a reported breach of security in which a protectee was harmed.

===Israel===
The Israeli Witness Protection Authority, a unit within the Ministry of Public Security is in charge of witness protection in Israel. The unit was created by law with the passing of the Witness Protection Law, 2008. The need for witness protection raised from the risks and dangers witnesses may face when cooperating with law enforcement. In Israel, witness protection is primarily managed by Israeli Police and the State Attorney&#x27;s Office. One thing that is different about Israel is the help of financially supporting changes to physical appearance.

===Italy===
The witness protection program in Italy was officially established in 1991, managed by the Central Protection Department () of the Polizia di Stato. Previously, witnesses were usually protected in exceptional cases by the police, but this often proved insufficient. In particular the witness protection program was focused on protecting the so-called &quot;pentiti&quot;, former members of criminal or terrorist organizations who, breaking the code of silence, decided to cooperate with the authorities.

During the 1980s, at the Maxi Trial against Cosa Nostra, informants Tommaso Buscetta and Salvatore Contorno were protected by the FBI due to the lack of a witness protection program in Italy. Although &quot;pentiti&quot; (usually from politically motivated terrorist organizations) had come forward since the 1970s during the so-called Years of Lead, it was not until the early 1990s that the program was officially established to efficiently manage the stream of &quot;pentiti&quot; which had defected from the major criminal organizations in Italy at the time, such as Cosa Nostra, the Camorra, the &#x27;Ndrangheta, the Sacra Corona Unita, the Banda della Magliana and several others. Most of the witnesses are given new identities and live under government protection for several years, or sometimes their entire life.

The witness protection program in Italy has sometimes come under criticism for failing to properly protect certain witnesses, as was the case with the murders of high-profile &quot;pentiti&quot; Claudio Sicilia and Luigi Ilardo.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Police provide protection for witnesses against members of criminal gangs and serious criminals who feel threatened or intimidated. They run a Witness Protection Programme that monitors the welfare of witnesses and if necessary, helps create new identities. There is an agreement between the police and the Department of Corrections to ensure that protected witnesses receive appropriate protection from that department. In 2007 the programme became the subject of public controversy when a protected witness&#x27;s previous conviction for drunk driving was withheld from police and he continued driving, eventually killing another motorist in a road accident while drunk.

===Switzerland===
Swiss law provides for a witness protection program coordinated by the witness protection unit of the Federal Office of Police. There is no agency provided, but there are certain circumstances where the police will step up. This is part of their witness protect regime in 2013. There was an outbreak in serious crimes where people didn&#x27;t want to speak up and that was when the federal government found a loophole in order to find justice.

===Taiwan===
The Republic of China promulgated the Witness Protection Act on February 9, 2000, in Taiwan. The act was implemented in order for people to feel comfortable testify against criminal or gangster acts. The prosecutor of judge of the case can appoint witness protection and they are held liable to hold that protective order.

===Thailand===
Thailand maintains a witness protection office under the jurisdiction of the country&#x27;s Ministry of Justice. Between 1996 and 1997 provisions were drafted for inclusion of a section covering witness protection in the kingdom&#x27;s 16th constitution, and finally, the witness protection provision was included in the constitution and took effect in the middle of 2003. Thailand&#x27;s Office of Witness Protection maintains a website.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, depending on the nature of the case and the location of the trial, the safety of witnesses is the responsibility of different agencies, such as the special judicial police unit Gryphon (part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs), the Security Service of Ukraine and, formerly, the special police unit Berkut.

===United Kingdom===

The UK has a nationwide witness protection system managed by the UK Protected Persons Service (UKPPS), responsible for the safety of around 3,000 people. The UKPPS is part of the National Crime Agency. The service is delivered regionally by local police forces. Prior to the formation of the UKPPS in 2013, witness protection was solely the responsibility of local police forces. One does not need to be a witness to be granted the protection of UKPPS (for example, targets of &quot;honour-based violence&quot;).

===United States===
The United States established a formal program of witness protection, run by the U.S. Marshals Service, under the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. Before that, witness protection had been instituted under the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 to protect people testifying against members of the Ku Klux Klan. Earlier in the 20th century, the Federal Bureau of Investigation also occasionally crafted new identities to protect witnesses.

Many states, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, New York and Texas, as well as Washington, D.C., have their own witness protection programs for crimes not covered by the federal program. The state-run programs provide less extensive protections than the federal program. They also cannot hold or have as many people involved as the federal program.

Before witness protection funds can be sought, law enforcement must conduct an assessment of the threat or potential for danger. This assessment includes an analysis of the resources, intent, and motivations of the person or persons making the threats, and how credible and serious the threats appear to be. When threats are deemed credible and witnesses request law enforcement assistance, witness protection funds can be used to provide assistance to witnesses which helps law enforcement keep witnesses safe and help ensure witnesses appear in court and provide testimony.

Special arrangements, known as S-5 and S-6 visas, also exist to bring key alien witnesses into the US from overseas. T visas may be used to admit into the United States victims of human trafficking willing to assist in prosecuting the traffickers.

<doc id="620427" wikidata="Q4892725" url="?curid=620427" title="Bermudian English">
<text>Bermudian English is a regional dialect of English found in Bermuda, a British overseas territory in the North Atlantic. Standard English is used in professional settings and in writing, while vernacular Bermudian English is spoken on more casual occasions. The Bermudian dialect began to develop following settlement in the early 17th century and retains traits of Elizabethan English. Bermudian Creole is also spoken in Bermuda, especially among younger Bermudians.

Casual observers tend to have difficulty in placing the Bermudian dialect, as it differs from those that are clearly British, American, or Caribbean; they also note that the accent tends to vary between individuals. It is often said to sound American or West Indian to a British ear, and quaintly British to American listeners.

==Categorisation==

Often described as one of the least researched dialects of English, Bermudian English was never creolised and is technically a koiné — a dialect arising from contact between multiple varieties of the same language. It has been influenced by British and Irish Englishes, Caribbean Englishes (including early influence from Bahamian English and Turks and Caicos Creole, as well as later influence from Jamaican Patwah), North American Englishes, and Azorean Portuguese. While some scholars have argued for its inclusion as a dialect of American English, English writer and historian Rosemary Hall says it should be considered in a category of its own. Hall says, &quot;While it&#x27;s true that Bermudian English shares a range of words and sounds with British, American, and Caribbean Englishes, it also has many unique features, meaning it&#x27;s probably most accurate to say that it&#x27;s a dialect in a category of its own.&quot; Scholars have also noted that there are differences between the English used by white Bermudians, which may be closer to North American English; and that used by Black Bermudians, which may be closer to Caribbean English. 

The first detailed scholarly study of Bermudian English conducted by Harry Morgan Ayers in 1933, stated this type of speech &quot;would create least remark, if indeed any, between, say, Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina&quot;. Bermuda was settled from England, as an extension of the Colony of Virginia, Charleston and the Carolina Province were settled from Bermuda, and Bermuda retained close links with both into the 19th century. The start of Bermuda&#x27;s tourism industry in the latter 19th century would see transport connections move to the North East of the United States, from where most of its visitors continue to come.

In certain aspects of vocalization, some Bermudian English dialects are close to some versions of Caribbean English, and some would bracket all these varieties to the broad region of the &quot;English-speaking West Indies&quot;. West Indian workers arrived on the island from the 1900s, primarily working in construction, while Americans arrived due to a US airbase stationed on the island from 1941 to 1995. There is evidence to suggest that the St. David&#x27;s dialect could actually be a decreolised English variety. 

Azorean Portuguese influenced Bermudian English to a lesser degree, as a result of immigration after slavery was made illegal on the island in 1834.

==Phonology==

The dialect&#x27;s most evident characteristic is a variation in letter/sound assignment. The switching of and , characteristic of many dialects in Southern England during the 18th and 19th centuries, and of and (similarly to the dialects of English speakers of Gaelic heritage), when combined with a front vowel, can both be seen in the title of a humorous glossary, (Bermudian Words). 

Bermuda was administratively part of continental British America until the 1783 independence of the colonies that became the United States of America, and thereafter was part of British North America, within which it was grouped with the Maritimes until 1867, at which point, as an Imperial fortress, it was left out of the formation of the Canadian dominion and remained under the administration of the British Government, which increasingly grouped Bermuda for convenience with the British West Indian colonies (usually termed &quot;the West Indies and Bermuda&quot; or &quot;the Caribbean and Bermuda&quot;). 

It is unclear whether any similarities between Bermudian English and Newfoundland English date from this period, or pre-date it. The use of and is interchangeable and vowels are often elongated. [θ] and [ð] turn into [f] and [v], respectively. Bermudian is also non-rhotic, like British English or the New York accent. There&#x27;s a simplification of codas like &#x27;best&#x27; and &#x27;soft&quot; become and . Coda [ɫ] is semivocalized to [w].

== Bermudian Creole ==
Bermudian Creole is a creolized form of Bermudian English (similar and related to the English-based creoles: Caymanian English, Turks and Caicos Creole, and San Andrés–Providencia Creole). It is a dialect of Jamaican Patwah, which is also spoken in Bermuda, especially among Bermuda&#x27;s younger generations.
Bermudian Creole is significantly influenced by Jamaican Patwah and shares many of the same words such as &quot;Bredren&quot; (Friend), &quot;Di&quot; (The), &quot;Gwine&quot; (Going), and &quot;Wahm&quot; (What&#x27;s happening). Which is due to a shared heritage, and the close familial ties that many Bermudians have to Jamaica, such as Premier David Burt (politician), Wayne Caines (MP), and former Premier Ewart Brown. Similarly Bermuda has also produced a number of internationally renowned Dancehall and Reggae artists such as Mishka (musician), and Collie Buddz, who are both native Creole speakers.

<text>The Ahoko is a traditional percussion instrument originating from the central part of Ivory Coast (Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) in West Africa.

The ahoko is a wooden rod with nutshells, each containing loose seeds, tied to strings which are then tightly wound around the end of the rod. The percussive sound can range from quiet to very loud.

In the Hornbostel–Sachs system it is categorised as 112.13 as a vessel rattle, a type of indirectly struck idiophone.

<text>Loch Maree () is a loch in Wester Ross in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. At long and with a maximum width of , it is the fourth-largest freshwater loch in Scotland; it is the largest north of Loch Ness. Its surface area is .

Loch Maree contains five large wooded islands and over 60 smaller ones, many of which have their own lochans. The largest island, Eilean Sùbhainn, contains a loch that itself contains an island, a situation that occurs nowhere else in Great Britain. Isle Maree holds the remains of a Pre-Reformation chapel and Christian pilgrimage shrine believed to be the 8th century hermitage of Saint Máel Ruba (d. 722), a Celtic Church missionary from Bangor Abbey in Gaelic Ireland who also founded the monastery of Applecross in 672. It is after him that Loch Maree is named; prior to the saint&#x27;s arrival in the area the loch is believed to have been named Loch Ewe, as evidenced by the name of the village of Kinlochewe (, meaning &quot;Head of Loch Ewe&quot;) which is located at the eastern end of Loch Ewe.

The loch is important for wildlife. It is the site of one of the largest breeding concentrations of black-throated diver in Great Britain, and also holds an important population of otter. The islands of Loch Maree are the location of some of the best native Caledonian pinewood in Scotland, and are particularly noted for their dragonflies, with 12 species having been recorded. The waters, islands and shoreline of Loch Maree are protected by several overlapping conservation designations.

==Geography==
Loch Maree is much longer than it is wide, stretching along a northwest-southeast axis. The outflow is via the short River Ewe, through which water enters the sea loch of Loch Ewe, close to the village of Poolewe; the village of Kinlochewe lies at the head of the loch at the southeastern end. The A832 road between the two runs along much of the southwestern shore of the loch, but diverges from it in the north to run via Gairloch, along the coast from Poolewe.

Loch Maree is divided into three main basins, and has many islands: the ratio of the area of the islands to the area of the surface water is greater than any other large loch in Scotland. The deepest of the basins, at , is known as the Grudie Basin, and lies between Isle Maree and the head of the loch. To the northwest of this basin lies the Slattadale Basin, which contains the majority of the islands. North of the islands lies a shallower area, separating the Slattadale Basin from the Ardlair Basin, the most irregularly shaped of the three.

The most prominent mountain on the northern side of Loch Maree is Slioch, one of Scotland&#x27;s Munros (a mountain over high), which dominates the eastern end of the loch above Kinlochewe. It is composed mainly of Torridonian sandstone of Precambrian age, lying on a bedrock of Lewisian gneiss. It is popular for hill walking, scrambling and climbing. Other peaks on the northern side include Beinn Àirigh Charr and Beinn Làir, both of which are classified as Corbetts. The entire length of the northeastern shore of Loch Maree forms part of the Letterewe, Heights of Kinlochewe &amp; Tournaig Estate, which extends north over an area known as the Fisherfield Forest. The southwestern side of Loch Maree is also mountainous, comprising the Torridon Forest. The most prominent peak is Beinn Eighe, which is capped with white quartzite. Three main landowners occupy the southwestern shore: from south to north these are NatureScot (the Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve), the Grudie &amp; Talladale Estate, and the Gairloch (Flowerdale &amp; Shieldaig) &amp; Conon Estate.

==History==

Between 671 and 722, Celtic Church missionary St Máel Ruba arrived at Loch Maree, and founded a chapel and Christian pilgrimage shrine on Eilean Maolruibhe. Remains of this chapel were reportedly still visible in 1861 but no traces now remain, although the burial ground associated with the chapel is still extant. A small covered holy well on the island is said to have been consecrated by the saint.

During the middle ages the island of Eilean Ghrùididh on Loch Maree was a centre for the MacBeaths; in or shortly after 1430 the MacBeaths were displaced by Clan MacLeod. Investigation of the island in 1965 found a fortified area measuring 44 by 36 metres with walls 1 m thick and 2 m high, with a 1.8 m deep dungeon in the southeast corner. No buildings were found within the fortifications.

Due to its remote location there is now little industry surrounding Loch Maree, however the area was formerly a centre for ironworking. During the seventeenth century up to 8 hectares of oak woodlands a day were turned into charcoal to fuel the smelting of bog iron at Letterewe on the northeast shore. Workmen from these iron furnaces are said to have been buried on Isle Maree. Remains of one iron furnace can be seen at a site known as the Red Smiddy on the northeast bank of the River Ewe between the outflow from the loch and Poolewe. Pieces of ore, slag and iron have been found at this site.

The loch became a popular spot for trout fishing after Queen Victoria visited the Loch Maree Hotel at Talladale in 1877, a visit which led to the naming of &quot;Victoria Falls&quot;, an attractive waterfall in the vicinity of the hotel. In 1893, there was a proposal to build a branch railway from Achnasheen to Aultbea along the south shore of Loch Maree. The railway would have increased Victorian tourist traffic, as well as providing a service for fisheries and the mail and a connection to Stornoway, however the plan was later abandoned.

==Ecology==
Loch Maree is of international importance for its special wildlife and biodiversity, and is the site of one of the largest breeding concentrations of black-throated diver in Great Britain.

Sea trout and salmon are an important part of the loch&#x27;s ecosystem, providing food for black-throated diver and otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;): juvenile trout can be an important part of the diet of black-throated diver. Until recently, thousands of adult sea trout (seagoing brown trout &quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) and salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;) returned to the loch from the sea every summer. Sea trout gathered in huge numbers in certain bays, providing some of the most exciting angling in Scotland for which the loch had an international reputation. A British record sea trout of was caught on a &quot;dapping fly&quot; in the loch in 1952. The sea trout fishery collapsed in the 1980s and 1990s. The loch also has two separate populations of Arctic charr (&quot;Salvelinus alpinus&quot;) about which little is known. One form of charr, with a big eye which feeds on the bottom in deep water matures at less than 15 cm. The other form grows to over 32 cm and can sometimes be seen in shoals ruffling the surface when the loch is calm.

The islands of Loch Maree are wooded, being the location of some of the best native Caledonian pinewood in Scotland. These woodlands, along with others in Wester Ross, are genetically distinct from other pinewoods in Scotland, showing more similarity to those in southern Europe. It is thought that this results from the fact that western Scotland became ice-free first at the end of the last ice-age, allowing pine to move north along the western fringe of Europe. Pines reached Eastern Scotland from more northerly areas during a later period, as the ice sheets retreated further. Scots pine are the dominant species in these woodlands, however other tree species such as rock whitebeam and juniper are also present. The islands of Loch Maree are particularly noted for their dragonflies, with 12 species having been recorded, including the northern emerald, azure hawker and white-faced darter. Pine martens and white-tailed sea eagles can be found on the islands, which are also a breeding site for redwings; greylag geese were known to breed here in the past, but have not done so since the 1970s.

==Conservation designations==

The presence of black-throated divers on the loch has led to it being designated as Special Protection Area (SPA) under the EU Habitats Directive. The loch is also designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), forming part of the Loch Maree Complex SAC, which extends to cover the surrounding hills including Beinn Eighe.

Over 60 islands within the loch are designated as the Loch Maree Islands National Nature Reserve (NNR), which has since 2014 been jointly managed with the neighbouring Beinn Eighe NNR as a single reserve. The Beinn Eighe and Loch Maree Islands NNR forms part of the designated Core Zone of the Wester Ross UNESCO Biosphere reserve.

Loch Maree is classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and has been designated as a Ramsar site since 19 September 1994. It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and lies within the Wester Ross national scenic area.

==In media==
Button-box accordionist, Fergie MacDonald topped the Scottish pop charts in 1966 with the tune &quot;Loch Maree Islands&quot; which pays tribute to the views of the loch, and vocal versions have been recorded by many artists over the years, notably Calum Kennedy. More recently a version of the song was included on Peat and Diesel&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Uptown Fank&quot;.

In the 2009-10 series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Natural World&quot;, episode 6, &quot;Highland Haven&quot;, stayed closer to home than usual, with a year-long look at the environment and wildlife of Loch Maree and its surroundings.

Loch Maree and its islands, including Isle Maree, Juniper and Rough Islands are the setting of Oscar de Muriel&#x27;s 2018 historical-crime novel Loch of the Dead, the fourth book in his Frey &amp; McGray series.

Loch Maree is mentioned in the Runrig song &quot;The Summer Walkers&quot; from the album &quot;The Stamping Ground&quot;.

:&quot;And it&#x27;s up by the Shin&quot;
:&quot;And up by the &#x27;Naver
:&quot;And the long winding shores Of Loch Maree&quot;
:&quot;By Ben Hope and Ben Loyal&quot;
:&quot;Stack and by Arkle&quot;

:&quot;Now the summer is here&quot;

==Folklore==
Thomas Pennant, writing in 1772, recorded that the loch was considered a holy well whose waters were thought to have curative effects, with being submerged in the water thought to be a cure for lunacy.

Isle Maree holds an oak wish tree made famous by a visit in 1877 by Queen Victoria mentioned in her published diaries. The tree, and others surrounding it, are festooned with hammered-in coins. It is near the traditional Christian pilgrimage shrine and holy well of local Celtic Church missionary St. Máel Rubha, whose intercession was believed to cure mental illnesses. In annual feast day festivals similar to Irish pattern days and Breton Pardons, votive offerings were made, including the slaughter and roasting of bulls, which continued up to the 18th century, according to records. This has led to speculation that the island was a place of pre-Christian pagan worship which was taken over by the saint. The same island contains ancient stands of oak and holly which have been linked with ancient Scottish druids.

Like Loch Ness and Loch Morar, Loch Maree has its own monster in the form of the &quot;muc-sheilch&quot;.

<text>Loschwitz Bridge (&#x27;) is a [[cantilever]] [[truss bridge]] over the river [[Elbe]] in [[Dresden]] the capital of [[Saxony]] in Germany. It connects the city districts of [[Blasewitz]] and [[Loschwitz]], two affluent residential areas, which around 1900 were amongst the most expensive in Europe. It is located close to [[Standseilbahn Dresden]] funicular railway and the world&#x27;s oldest suspension railway [[Schwebebahn Dresden]], as well as near the [[Dresden TV tower]]. The bridge is colloquially referred to as &quot;Blaues Wunder&quot; (&quot;Blue Wonder&quot;). This common name purportedly referred to the bridge&#x27;s original blue colour and being seen as a technological miracle at the time; it is also understood to carry the cynical connotation referencing the German [[idiom]]&#x27; meaning &quot;to experience an unpleasant surprise&quot; (literally: &quot;to experience a blue wonder&quot;), reflecting the skeptical view of contemporary commentators. There is also a bridge in Wolgast known as &quot;Blaues Wunder&quot;.
Construction took two years and was completed in 1893 at a cost of 2.25 million Goldmarks (equivalent to million €) and named &quot;&quot; in honor of Albert, King of Saxony. In the 19th century, a bridge of this length without supporting river piers was considered a technological masterpiece. Today the technology is less miraculous, but the bridge is a much-loved symbol of the city.

The original bridge toll ended during the hyperinflation of 1923. Towards the end of World War II, an SS unit attempted to destroy the bridge, but this was prevented when two people cut the detonator wires. Preserved in its original construction, the advanced age of the structure in recent years has led to some traffic limits. Until the opening of the &quot;Waldschlösschen Bridge&quot; on 26 August 2013, it was the only Elbe crossing east of the city centre.

The surrounding area of of the Elbe meadows was declared a cultural World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in 2004, but lost the title in 2009 following the construction of the Waldschlösschen Bridge, meant to relieve congestion on the &quot;Blue Wonder&quot;.

<text>The Knights of Father Mathew was a Catholic temperance society founded by Fr Theobald Matthew in Ireland which promoted complete abstinence from intoxicating liquors.

== History ==
It was founded in Cork in 1838 by Theobald Mathew, a Capuchin friar – generally known as Father Mathew. Under his influence, branches the organization spread throughout Ireland, though it was badly disrupted by the Great Irish Famine of 1846 to 1849. Father Mathew also travelled in England and Scotland (1842) and in the United States (1849 to 1851) to preach temperance. It is estimated that 7,000,000 took the pledge of abstinence under his influence.

Father Mathew began his work in the U.S. in 1849, at which time he was entertained by the President and granted a seat within the bar of the Senate and on the floor of the House. Only one foreigner, General Lafayette, had previously been given that honor. He was also lauded on the occasion by famous statesman Henry Clay.

Father Mathew spent two and a half years in the U.S., traveled 37,000 miles, visited 25 states, administered the temperance pledge in over 300 cities and towns to an estimated more than 500,000 people.

The Knights of Father Mathew organization in the U.S. was established in St. Louis, Missouri, on 26 April, 1872. At this time, it was an fraternal society limited to Irish immigrants.

In 1881, it added life insurance as a benefit available to members. Chapters or “councils” were permitted to organize branches of Catholic women that were called &quot;Ladies&#x27; Auxiliaries of the Knights of Father Mathew.&quot; The Ladies&#x27; Auxiliaries were especially active in promoting temperance among children. Both the Knights of Father Mathew affiliated with the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America in 1895, as did the Ladies&#x27; Auxiliaries of the Knights of Father Mathew.

Some members were buried with KFM or K. of F. M. – Knights of Father Mathew – or LAKFM – Ladies Auxiliary of the Knights of Father Mathew on their tombstones.
=== 1900s ===
In early 1900s expanded to include non-Irish Catholics, especially second-generation English-speaking German immigrants In 1915, renamed the Knights and Ladies of Father Matthew when women were admitted to full membership. Membership declined in the 1920s and the organization disbanded in 1931.

<text>Antonio Maura Montaner (2 May 1853 – 13 December 1925) was Prime Minister of Spain on five separate occasions.

== Early life ==
Maura was born in Palma, on the island of Mallorca, he was the seventh child in a family of ten siblings, His parents were Bartolomé, owner of a tannery, and Margarita, who devoted herself entirely to the care of her family. 

He moved to study law in Madrid. There, he met the brothers Trifino and Honorio Gamazo Calvo. This connection provided him an opportunity to intern at the law firm of Mr. Germán Gamazo, setting the stage for his future career in law and politics.

In 1878, Maura married Constancia Gamazo y Calvo, the sister of Germán Gamazo. They had several sons and a daughter together, many of whom have been prominent in Spanish politics.

== Early Political career ==
He was elected a Congressman at Spain&#x27;s &quot;Cortes Generales&quot; (Congress of Deputies) for Palma de Mallorca in 1881, which he would represent until 1923 in successive legislatures. 

His political career was marked by rapid advancements, including an initial appointment as a Vice-president of the Royal Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation from 1882 to 1884, and later as Vice President of the Congress of Deputies in 1886. 

His political influence expanded significantly when he rejected a ministerial position in a Sagastino cabinet in 1888, only to accept the role of Minister of Overseas Territories under President Práxedes Mateo Sagasta from December 1892 to March 1894. 

He went served as Minister of Grace and Justice from November 1894 to March 1895 under the same administration. During this period, he was elected served times as President of the Royal Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation. 

Although he had started his political career as a liberal, after the death of his brother-in-law Germán Gamazo in 1901, he assumed leadership of Gamazo&#x27;s group, which would merge with the Conservative Party 

He was appointed by President Francisco Silvela as Minister of the Interior from December 1902 to July 1903. 

In 1903, he was elected as an academician of the Royal Spanish Academy (R.A.E.), the official regulator of the Spanish language, with the seat &quot;&quot;U&quot;.&quot; 

== Premier for five times ==
He first assumed the presidency of the Council of Ministers in December 1903. That premiership would be shortlived, and he would resign exactly one year later, in December 1904, in which Barcelona experienced its first terrorist attack. 

He was President again between January 1907 and October 1909, in a period of rare stability that earned the nickname &quot;Long Government&quot;. He fell from power after his suppression of an uprising in Barcelona in 1909, called the Tragic Week. 

Maura was a hero of a youth movement, the &quot;Mauristas&quot;, that wanted him as a new head of state of Spain at a time of substantial resentment of King Alfonso XIII. That and Maura&#x27;s ambition caused him to fall out with the King. 

Maura later headed coalition cabinets with other parties but his time in power was limited. He was President between March and November of 1918, again in 1919, and between August 1921 and March 1922, following the Disaster of Annual.

Disillusioned by the advent of Miguel Primo de Rivera&#x27;s regime in 1923, he retired from politics. During Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship, he remained aloof from both Primo de Rivera and the King. 

== Later Years and Retirement ==
Aside from his political work, he served in major roles in Spanish Society, including as Director of Royal Spanish Academy from 1913 to 1925, and as President of the Royal Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation from 1916 to 1918. 

He was also elected to the Moral and Political Sciences Academy, and the Fine Arts of San Fernando, in recognition of his gifts as a watercolorist.   

In 1920 he was awarded the title of Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. 

He died on December 13, 1925, while painting in El Canto del Pico, Torrelodones.

<text>The Knights of Honor (K. of H.), was a fraternal order and secret society in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century. The Knights were one of the most successful fraternal beneficiary societies of its time.

== History ==

The origin of the order goes back to disputes in the state of Kentucky among members of the Order of United American Mechanics and the Ancient Order of United Workmen in Kentucky in the early 1870s. Dr. Darius Wilson was a Louisville physician and avid fraternalist. In addition to being a Freemason and an Odd Fellow, in 1872 he was elected State Council Secretary for OUAM of Kentucky. According to his own account, his work leading the OUAM made him so well known that he was approached by the leadership of the AOUW to help organize lodges for that Order as well. After being initiated in 1873 by Grand Master Workman Handy and the Grand Lodge of Kentucky, Dr. Wilson successfully organized Louisville Lodge #6, the sixth lodge of the order in Kentucky, with twenty four of Louisville&#x27;s most prominent citizens as members and himself as Master Workman.

While Dr. Wilson was studying the ritual of the AOUW he learned the national leadership of the OUAM had refused to charter a new Council of its youth affiliate, the Junior Order of United American Mechanics because they had adopted the name &quot;Robert E. Lee.&quot; After becoming aware of this &quot;intolerance,&quot; Dr. Wilson resigned as Secretary of the Kentucky Council and withdrew from the Order. A local chapter of the JOUAM had also surrendered its charter in protest over the senior Orders actions. This posed a problem, as the members of the Junior Order were only eighteen to twenty one years old and none of the existing fraternal orders would accept them, other than a few temperance groups. At the request of Council president J . A. Demaree, Dr. Wilson drew up a constitution and helped the Council reorganize as the Gold Lodge #1, Knights of Honor at a meeting held on June 30, 1870.

Dr. Wilson never intended to create further lodges of the Knights of Honor and was devoting his time to the organizing more lodges of the AOUW when his commission from the latter was revoked on October 24, 1873. That night Grand Master Workman Handy went to Louisville Lodge #6 and had charges drawn up against him for creating a new fraternal order and copying the AOUWs constitution. A committee was set up to investigate the charges. According to Wilson, the members of this committee were, like him, also Freemasons and Odd Fellows, and could see that the constitution of the AOUW was a copy of the constitution of the Odd Fellows Grand Lodge of Ohio, itself a copy of the constitution of a Masonic Grand Lodge.

Grand Master Workman Hardy maintained that the creation of a rival order while holding a commission from the AOUW was a breach of trust on the part of Dr. Wilson. Other have questioned whether the constitutions and laws were essentially those of the Odd Fellows or Masons.

In any event, Dr. Wilson ignored Hardy&#x27;s opposition, abandoned his medical practice and devoted his energies to organizing the Knights of Honor. The meeting he had called to organize Lodge #8 of the AOUW, he instead made Louisville Lodge #2 of the Knights. By his own account he secured all the members and organized 80 of the first 81 lodges. He also tried early on to get the group on a graded assessment formula. However, his associates disagreed, feeling that people would not want to join an order that charged more than the $1 flat assessment and wanted to set the age limit for membership at 44. A compromise was reached with all members under 44 paying the $2 flat assessment rate and a graded assessment for ages 44 to 45.

Sick benefits were paid out by the local lodges, but death benefits were managed by the Supreme Lodge. Members could buy certificates of $500, $1000 or $2000 plus assessments. The Knights differed from other orders such as the AOUW by using a graded assessment plan for its death benefits. Members between 45 and 55 paid more than those between 21 and 45. Soon the society admitted men 18 to 21 years old and expanded its graded assessment plan for all new members under the age of 45. By the mid 1890s, however, it became clear that this system of paying a fixed assessment year after year, based on the date the member joined the society would eventually be &quot;found wanting&quot;. After prolonged investigation the Knights adopted a new insurance system with each age paying a different rate of assessment from 18 to 61, the effect being that each member in any one year would only pay out the benefits for the other members his age based on mortality tables.

Unfortunately, when the Knights changed to a more actuarially sound financial basis in 1895 membership declined as insurance began to cost more. The group disbanded in 1916.

== Organization ==

The Knights were organized along the same three tier structure as most fraternal orders of the era. Local groups were &quot;Subordinate Lodges,&quot; state or regional groups were &quot;Grand Lodges&quot; and the national authority was the &quot;Supreme Lodge.&quot; In 1896 the Knights had thirty-six Grand Lodges and 2,600 Subordinate Lodges with an average of fifty members each By 1910, however, the number of Subordinate Lodges was down to 1,234. The national headquarters of the organization was in St. Louis, Missouri.

== Membership ==

Membership was open all acceptable white men of good moral character, who believed in God, were of good bodily health and able to support themselves and their family. In 1875, the Supreme Lodge created a female auxiliary called the Degree of Protection open to the wives, mothers, sisters and unmarried daughters of the Knights, as well as males who were already members of the Knights of Honor. However, in the years that followed only a few Lodges of this degree were created and in 1877 the Supreme Lodge abolished the degree. Thereafter, representatives of the degree met in Louisville and organized a new society, the Order of Mutual Protection of the Knights and Ladies of Honor, subsequently known as the Knights and Ladies of Honor.

The Knights were founded by an original group of 17 men in 1873 and increased to 99 by the end of the year. By the end of 1874, it had increased to 999 members. The group was hit hard by the yellow fever epidemic of 1875–1878. In 1878 alone, the order had to pay out $385,000 for death benefits for 193 members. Despite this, the Knights disbursed large sums of money to suffers of the yellow fever who were not members of the order. Over the next 18 years, the order steadily increased its membership, reaching 126,000 in 1895. That year, as stated, the group changed from the graded assessment program to a more actuarially sound one, causing costs to go up and membership began to decline. There were 96,000 members in 1897 and 90,335 in 1898.

== Ritual ==

Unlike most fraternal orders of its day, the Knights of Honor did not require prospective members to swear an oath in the initiation rite, but merely to promise to obey the rules of the order and &quot;protect a worthy brother in his adversities and afflictions.&quot; The secrecy of the order was declared to be only that which was necessary to keep &quot;intruders and unworthy men&quot; from gaining benefits.

<text>George Edward Lopez (born April 23, 1961) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He is most known for starring in his self-produced ABC sitcom &quot;George Lopez&quot;. His stand-up comedy examines race and ethnic relations, including Mexican American culture. Lopez has received several honors for his work and contributions to the Latino community, including the 2003 Imagen Vision Award, the 2003 Latino Spirit Award for Excellence in Television and the National Hispanic Media Coalition Impact Award. He was also named one of &quot;The Top 25 Hispanics in America&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2005.

==Early life==
George Edward Lopez was born on April 23, 1961, in Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California, the son of Frieda and Anatasio Lopez, a migrant worker. He is of Mexican descent. He was deserted by his father when he was two months old and by his mother when he was 10 years old, and was raised by his maternal grandmother, Benita Gutierrez, a factory worker, and step-grandfather, Refugio Gutierrez, a construction worker. Lopez attended San Fernando High School, graduating in 1979.

==Career==

===Television===
In 2000, after several years of performing stand-up comedy, Lopez was approached by actress Sandra Bullock for Lopez to produce and star in a comedy. Bullock was concerned about the lack of Hispanic-oriented sitcoms on American television and pushed to get a sitcom on television that starred Hispanics without being exclusively about the Hispanic American community. Long criticized by Hispanic American groups for lack of Latinos on their television shows, ABC quickly picked up the television series. In 2002, Lopez became one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of Desi Arnaz, Freddie Prinze, and John Leguizamo. &quot;George Lopez&quot; is an American situation comedy that originally aired on ABC from 2002 to 2007. Lopez is the co-creator, writer, producer, and star of the show.

On March 8, 2007, it was announced that &quot;George Lopez&quot; would join the Nick at Nite lineup. It first aired on Nick at Nite on September 10, 2007. On May 15, 2007, ABC announced that the series would be canceled after its sixth season. The show last aired on ABC September 7, 2007. The show also entered syndication in the fall of 2007. Never a big Nielsen hit in prime-time, the show became a surprise success in syndication.

After receiving the news that his show was canceled in 2007, Lopez criticized president of ABC Entertainment Steve McPherson for using racially motivated reasons for his decision. The actor told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;TV just became really, really white again&quot;, and lashed out against ABC by saying, &quot;So a chicano can&#x27;t be on TV, but a caveman can?&quot; in reference to the short-lived sitcom &quot;Cavemen&quot;, which was replacing &quot;George Lopez&quot; on the schedule. &quot;Cavemen&quot; garnered a sharply negative reception from critics and viewers, and was canceled after 13 episodes. Lopez blamed ABC for causing over a hundred of his show&#x27;s staff to become jobless.

Lopez was a cast member and commentator for HBO&#x27;s hit sports show &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; for the 2003–04 football season.

Lopez guest-starred as the mayor of Reno, Nevada, in season five of &quot;Reno 911!&quot; in 2008.

On March 28, 2009, it was announced that Lopez would be hosting his own late-night talk show on TBS. Lopez hosted a late-night talk show entitled &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; on TBS Monday through Thursday at midnight Eastern Time. The show debuted in November 2009. In November 2010, the show moved back to midnight ET to accommodate a new show with former &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Conan O&#x27;Brien. Although O&#x27;Brien had reservations about the move and initially refused TBS&#x27;s offer, Lopez supported and even advocated for it, making it different from the 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict that saw O&#x27;Brien depart NBC after a proposal to push &quot;Tonight&quot; back 30 minutes for Jay Leno to return to the 11:35 p.m. slot. On August 10, 2011, Lopez received a cancellation notice from TBS. The network decided not to renew &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; for a third season.

On April 18, 2013, it was announced that Lopez would be starring in his own sitcom on FX called &quot;Saint George&quot;, which premiered on March 6, 2014. &quot;Saint George&quot; was produced under Debmar-Mercury and Lionsgate Television&#x27;s syndication model, which states that if a show hits certain ratings thresholds in its first 10-episode run, it triggers an additional 90-episode order. Failing to do so, &quot;Saint George&quot; was canceled on June 25, 2014, after one season.
In August 2015, TV Land announced a straight-to-series order for &quot;Lopez&quot;, a semi-autobiographical single-camera sitcom, which debuted on March 30, 2016.

Lopez was invited to be a guest judge on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in 2016. He was allowed to use his golden buzzer once, which made an act go straight to the live shows. He used his on the dance group Malevo.

In May 2022, NBC picked up Lopez&#x27;s new series, &quot;Lopez vs Lopez&quot;, where he co-stars opposite of his daughter, Mayan.

==Personal life==
In 1993, Lopez married Ann Serrano. The couple has a daughter, Mayan, born in 1996. On September 27, 2010, Lopez announced that he and his wife had decided to end their marriage. Serrano filed for divorce on November 23, 2010, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on July 1, 2011.

Lopez has a genetic condition that caused his kidneys to deteriorate. His doctors had told him in April 2004 that he was going to require an organ transplant but he postponed the operation until finishing the fourth season of &quot;George Lopez&quot;. In 2005, his wife Ann donated one of her kidneys to Lopez. The transplant was successful; Lopez lost after the operation due in part to the improvement in his health. He brought awareness to the issue on his show; his character&#x27;s father Manny was diagnosed with a similar illness.

Lopez is a supporter of the Democratic Party and endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Lopez is a supporter of Israel. In October 2023, he signed an open letter supporting Israel during the Israel–Hamas war.

Lopez owns a house in Los Feliz, Los Angeles.

Though he was raised Catholic, he is not religious, though he does believe in God and &quot;the biblical themes of &#x27;faith and love&#x27;&quot;.

In August 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine recognized George as one of &quot;The 25 Most Influential Hispanics in America&quot;. On October 18, 2011, Lopez&#x27;s elementary school, San Fernando Elementary School, honored him for his beneficent efforts by naming their auditorium after him.

<doc id="620463" wikidata="Q5193532" url="?curid=620463" title="Culture of Bermuda">
<text>The culture of Bermuda reflects the heritage of its people, who are chiefly of Native American, African, and European descent. A small percentage of Asians also live on the island. Although Bermuda is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, it also has strong historical links with the United States. On one hand, Bermudians seem British in their customs - for example, playing cricket, driving on the left, and having Queen Elizabeth II on their banknotes. At the same time, a strong North American cultural influence is obvious: the currency is on par with the US Dollar; Bermudians frequently watch television from the US. Dress in Bermuda, however, is distinct from either American or British styles. While in the US or the United Kingdom, shorts are considered casual dress, Bermuda shorts are considered to be formal attire in Bermuda, and are worn with a jacket and tie. 

Bermudians may seem more conservative than people in the UK or North America, and are more concerned with etiquette. The islanders highly value protocol, and place a great emphasis on pomp and ceremony. For example, to ask somebody for directions in Bermuda without first saying &#x27;good morning&#x27; or &#x27;good afternoon&#x27; is considered to be abrupt and rude. This causes misunderstandings and embarrassment on the part of many US or British visitors, for whom this is perfectly normal, and who intend no offense. Topless sunbathing is not simply frowned upon as immodest - it is against the law. 

However, Bermudians can also be tolerant of behaviour that would be considered eccentric elsewhere. One example is Johnny Barnes, a retired bus driver who stood by the road in Hamilton, greeting commuters on their way to work, often by name, wishing them a good morning, and telling them all &quot;I love you!&quot;. So great is the esteem in which he is held locally that a statue of him now stands in Hamilton.

==Architecture==
==Literature==
Bermuda&#x27;s early literary history was largely limited to non-Bermudian writers commenting on the island. These included John Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles&quot; (1624), and Edmund Waller&#x27;s poem, &quot;Battle of the Summer Islands&quot; (1645). In the 20th century, a large number of books were written and published locally, though few were aimed at a wider market than Bermuda (most of these being scholarly reference books, rather than creative writing). One Bermudian novelist, Brian Burland, has achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally, although the first (and undoubtedly the most important, historically) notable book credited to a Bermudian was the &quot;History of Mary Prince&quot;, a slave narrative by a Bermudian woman, Mary Prince, which helped to end slavery in the British Empire. Bermuda&#x27;s proximity to the United States means that many aspects of US culture are reflected or incorporated into Bermudian culture. Many non-Bermudian writers have also made Bermuda their home, or have had homes there, including A.J. Cronin and F. Van Wyck Mason, who wrote on Bermudian subjects.

==Music==
A traditional form of music and dance is known as The Bermuda Gombey, which is of West African derivation, and involves rhythmic chanting and rapid drumbeat. The Gombey incorporates traditional West African dance with components from Christian missionaries, British soldiers and peoples of continental North America and the Caribbean. Also encountered in the Bahamas, the Bermudian version of the dance involves the use of the British military snare drum, beaten with wooden sticks. This practice stems from the fact that many slaves worked in British military bases. These dances are traditionally performed on New Year&#x27;s Day, Boxing Day, and 24 May (Bermuda Day).

<text>Sveti Vlas (also known as St. Vlas; ; ), is a town and resort on the Black Sea coast in Nesebar municipality, Burgas Province, Bulgaria. In July, 2007 its population was 3,869.

==History==
The town is located at the foot of the southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains, in the northern part of Burgas Bay. A settlement was founded at the present place of Sveti Vlas in the 2nd century AD by Thracians and other Greeks, possibly &quot;Larissa&quot; (Λάρισα), though this site is more likely to be at Cape St. Athanasius. It acquired the name &quot;Sveti Vlas&quot; in the 14th century after Saint Blaise, a monastery dedicated to whom existed in the region, but was burnt down in the 14th-18th century by consecutive pirate raids. During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, it was known as &quot;Kücük manastir&quot; or simply &quot;Manastir&quot; (&quot;monastery&quot; in greek), while the name &quot;Sveti Vlas&quot; became official after 1886.

Until 1920, the population of Sveti Vlas was predominantly Greek. After 1920 as a result of the exchange of population between Greece and Bulgaria most of the local Greeks emigrated to Western Thrace (ceded to Greece in 1920) Greece and found their new home in the village of Strymi (until 1920 Chadarli), Sapes municipality. Less than 10 Greek families remained in Sveti Vlas. After 1912 and especially after 1920 tens of Bulgarian families emigrated from Greece, predominantly from Greek Macedonia and established themselves in Sveti Vlas. 
The settlement became a climatic sea resort in 1963 and a town on 2 February 2006. Sveti Vlas is the only place on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast where the beaches face directly south.

==Tourism==
Sveti Vlas has grown as a tourist resort in recent times, serving as a quieter alternative to nearby Sunny Beach. The gap between the two places is shrinking as more hotels and holiday apartments are built along the coast. Sveti Vlas lies at the northern end of a bay which has Sunny Beach in its middle and the ancient town of Nesebar at its southern end. Sunny Beach and Nesebar are easily accessible by bus or taxi, and there are also boats going between Sveti Vlas and Nesebar.

The resort was mainly popular amongst inland Bulgarian tourists, but recently there is rapid growth in the number of foreign tourists, mainly from Russia, but also from Great Britain, Poland, Romania and Scandinavia. Even though Sveti Vlas was heavily developed in 2000&#x27;s it remained pretty quiet and calm down place, making it good place to have a rest. Due to that fact the typical visitors in the resort are families with children.

The latest development of the area has been the building of the Dinevi marina, the largest in Bulgaria. The Dinevi brothers have been developing the area with numerous complexes, highlighted by the marina itself. The latest development being worked on is Complex Admiral, due to be completed in 2016. The beach was expanded in 2007-2009 using rocks and sand that was removed when digging out for the marina. The marina with its clubs and restaurants has become famous among the wealthier people in Bulgaria, and expensive cars like Ferraris and Porsches can frequently be seen.

<text>Emona (early ) or Aemona (short for ) was a Roman castrum, located in the area where the navigable Nauportus River came closest to Castle Hill, serving the trade between the city&#x27;s settlers – colonists from the northern part of Roman Italy – and the rest of the empire. 
Emona was the region&#x27;s easternmost city, although it was assumed formerly that it was part of the Pannonia or Illyricum, but archaeological findings from 2008 proved otherwise.
From the late 4th to the late 6th century, Emona was the seat of a bishopric that had intensive contacts with the ecclesiastical circle of Milan, reflected in the architecture of the early Christian complex along Erjavec Street in present-day Ljubljana.

The Visigoths camped by Emona in the winter of 408/9, the Huns attacked it during their campaign of 452, the Langobards passed through on their way to Italy in 568, and then came incursions by the Avars and Slavs. The ancient cemetery in Dravlje indicates that the original inhabitants and invaders were able to live peacefully side by side for several decades. After the first half of the 6th century, there was no life left in Emona. The 18th-century Ljubljana Renaissance elite shared the interest in Antiquity with the rest of Europe, attributing the founding of Ljubljana to the mythical Jason and the Argonauts. Other ancient Roman towns located in present-day Slovenia include Nauportus (now Vrhnika), Celeia (now Celje), Neviodunum (now the village of Drnovo) and Poetovio (now Ptuj).

==History==


During the 1st century BC a Roman military stronghold was built on the site of the present Ljubljana, below Castle hill. Construction of the Roman settlement of Emona, fortified with strong walls, followed in AD 14. It had a population of 5,000 to 6,000 people, mostly merchants and craftsmen. The town had its own goddess, Equrna, and was also an important Early Christian centre. Emona&#x27;s administrative territory or &quot;ager&quot; stretched from Atrans (Trojane) along the Karawanks mountains towards the north, near Višnja Gora to the east, along the Kolpa River in the south, and bordered to the west with the territory of Aquileia at the village of Bevke.

According to Ammianus Marcellinus, one of the reasons for the war between Licinius and Constantine the Great was that Licinius destroyed the busts and statues of Constantine at Emona.

After few months of occupation in 388, the citizens of Emona saluted Emperor Theodosius I entering the liberated city after the victorious Battle of the Save, where Theodosius I defeated the army of the Roman usurper Magnus Maximus.
==Historical descriptions==
According to Herodotus, Emona was founded by Jason, when he travelled through the country with the Argonauts, and named by him in honour of his Thessalian homeland.
Sozomen wrote that when the Argonauts left from the Aeetes, they returned from a different route, crossed the sea of Scythia, sailed through some of the rivers there, and when they were near the shores of Italy, they built a city in order to stay at the winter, which they called Emona. Zosimus wrote that after they left from the Aeetes, they arrived at the mouth of the Ister River which it discharges itself into the Black Sea and they went up that river against the stream, by the help of oars and convenient gales of wind. After they managed to do it, they built the city of Emona as a memorial of their arrival there.

According to the 18th-century historian Johann Gregor Thalnitscher, the original predecessor of Emona was founded c. 1222 BC. (The date, although based on legend and poetic speculation, actually fits in both with Herodotus&#x27; account and the date of the earliest archaeological remains found so far)

According to 1938 article by the historian Balduin Saria, Emona was founded in late AD 14 or early AD 15, on the site of the Legio XV Apollinaris, after it left for Carnuntum, by a decree of Emperor Augustus and completed by his successor, Emperor Tiberius. Later archaeological findings have not rejected nor clearly confirmed this hypothesis and it is currently () most widely accepted.

==Location and layout==


The location of Emona overlaps with the southwest part of the old nucleus of the modern city of Ljubljana. In a rectangle with a central square or forum and a system of rectangular intersecting streets, Emona was laid out as a typical Roman town. According to Roman custom, there were cemeteries along the northern, western, and eastern thoroughfares into the city – from the directions of Celeia, Aquileia, and Neviodunum. The wider area surrounding the town saw the development of typical Roman countryside: villages, hamlets, estates, and brickworks.

==Archaeological findings==

Archaeological findings have been found in every construction project in the center of Ljubljana. Intensive archaeological research on Emona dates back 100 years, although it was the Roman town was portrayed from the 17th century onward. Numerous remains have been excavated there, such as parts of the Roman wall, residential houses, statues, tombstones, several mosaics, and parts of the early Christian baptistery, which can be still seen today.

Regarding its location within Roman Italy, in 2001 a boundary stone between Aquileia and Emona was discovered in the vicinity of Bevke in the bed of the Ljubljanica River. The stone is made of Aurisina limestone. Because similar stones were only used to demarcate two communities belonging to the same Roman province and because it is not disputed that Aquileia belonged to Roman Italy, this means that both towns belonged to Italy and that Emona was never part of Illyricum (or, later, of the province of Pannonia).

===Archaeological parks and preserving of the heritage===
The architect Jože Plečnik redesigned the remains of the Roman walls: he cut two new passages to create a link to Snežnik Street () and Murnik Street (), and behind the walls he arranged a park displaying architectural elements from Antiquity, with a stone monument collection in the Emona city gate. Above the passageway to Murnik Street he set up a pyramid, which he covered with turf. After the Second World War, attempts were made to embed references to Emona grid into modern Ljubljana, with the Roman forum becoming part of the Ferant Park apartment blocks and an echo of the rotunda located along Slovenia Street ().

==Bishopric==
There was a Christian bishopric named Aemona, whose bishop Maximus participated in the Council of Aquileia, 381, which condemned Arianism. After the destruction of Aemona in the 7th century, the bishop&#x27;s seat was transferred to Novigrad (). In Latin the name &quot;Aemona&quot; continued to be used for the diocese. Originally a suffragan of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, in 1272 it was attached instead to the ecclesiastical province and patriarchate of Grado, a patriarchate that in 1451 passed to Venice. In 1828 Pope Leo XII abolished the see as a residential diocese with effect from the death of Bishop Teodoro Lauretano Balbi on 23 May 1831. Its territory then passed to the diocese of Trieste-Capodistria. The Second World War brought about a change of political borders and in 1977 what had been the territory of the diocese of Aemona or Cittanova became part of the Croatian diocese of Poreč and Pula.

No longer a residential bishopric, Aemona or Cittanova is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

Because of the connection of this Aemona with Istria, some have questioned whether the episcopal see is to be identified with the Emona or Aemona, whose site is now occupied by Ljubljana. It has even been argued that there were in fact three cities called by the same or similar names, the one that Pliny the Elder speaks of as a &quot;colonia&quot; in the province of Pannonia; another in the province of Noricum; and a third in Istria.

<text>Priseltsi - Burgas Province () is a village in South- East Bulgaria, situated in Obshtina Nessebar, in the Burgas region.

Priseltsi is an 8km/10 minute drive from the town of Obzor, a seaside town with much development in progress. It is known for its clean fresh air, rural freedom, clear night skies and unique wildlife and nature. 

There are quite a few newly built, modern houses and some older ones in need of repair. A small church has been built and paid for by the local inhabitants, most of which are elderly and all of which are warm and kind-hearted. Pavements are currently being upgraded at the north end of the village. 

There is one small shop/café which is only open on certain days and there are always plenty of farm animals running free around the village. 
A cultural centre has been opened at the north end of the village - its expected to run traditional folk dancing evening and various outdoor activities. There is a small path through a forest on the North-Western side of the village which takes you through sunflower fields, over a bridge and straight into the neighbouring village of Popovich.

It is not uncommon to hear Jackals, hunters or simply silence (bar the crickets) at night here and it is undoubtedly peaceful when compared to nearby Obzor

Local farms sell milk, cheese, eggs, lamb, chicken and on occasion Rakija/Rakia</text><links>

<text>Chiranjeevi (born Konidela Sivasankara Varaprasad; 22 August 1955) is an Indian actor, politician, and philanthropist known for his work in Telugu cinema. Known as the &quot;Mega Star&quot;, he is widely regarded as one of the most successful and influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. Chiranjeevi holds the record for the most &quot;Industry Hits&quot; in Telugu cinema, with eight films emerging as the top-grossers of their time—a feat unmatched by any actor in the industry&#x27;s 100-year history. He is also celebrated as one of the finest dancers in Indian cinema. He has received numerous honours, including the Padma Bhushan in 2006 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2024 from the Government of India, as well as the IFFI Indian Film Personality of the Year Award in 2022. His other accolades include the Raghupathi Venkaiah Award, three Nandi Awards, and nine Filmfare Awards South, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2013, CNN-IBN recognized him as one of &quot;the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema&quot;. In 2024, he was honoured with a Guinness World Record as the most prolific actor-dancer in the Indian film industry. 

Chiranjeevi made his acting debut in 1978, initially gaining recognition for his supporting, anti-hero, and antagonist roles. He later transitioned to lead roles with notable success. His breakthrough came with the 1983 film &quot;Khaidi&quot;, which became the highest-grossing Telugu film at the time and established him as a leading actor in the industry. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Chiranjeevi starred in various &quot;Industry Hits&quot;highest-grossers of all timelike &quot;Pasivadi Pranam&quot; (1987), &quot;Yamudiki Mogudu&quot; (1988), &quot;Attaku Yamudu Ammayiki Mogudu&quot; (1989), &quot;Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari&quot; (1990), &quot;Gang Leader&quot; (1991), and &quot;Gharana Mogudu&quot; (1992). Notably, &quot;Gharana Mogudu&quot; was the first South Indian film to earn over 10 crore in distributor share, prompting &quot;The Week&quot; magazine to label him &quot;Bigger than Bachchan&quot; and &quot;the new money machine.&quot;

For his role in &quot;Aapadbandhavudu&quot; (1992), Chiranjeevi was paid 1.25 crore, making him the highest-paid actor in India at the time and the first Indian actor to command a 1 crore remuneration for a film. During this period, he received widespread critical acclaim for his performances in &quot;Swayamkrushi&quot; (1987), &quot;Rudraveena&quot; (1988), and &quot;Aapadbandhavudu&quot; (1992), showcasing his versatility as an actor who excelled in both commercial blockbusters and critically acclaimed films. Notably, &quot;Swayamkrushi&quot; was screened at the Moscow International Film Festival, while &quot;Rudraveena&quot;, which he co-produced, won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Chiranjeevi continued to dominate the box office with films like &quot;Master&quot; (1997), and &quot;Choodalani Vundi&quot; (1998). His 2002 film &quot;Indra&quot; was the highest-grossing Telugu film for many years, and socially impactful films like &quot;Tagore&quot; (2003) and &quot;Shankar Dada M.B.B.S.&quot; (2004) became major blockbusters, further cementing his legacy.

On 2 October 1998, Chiranjeevi established the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust, which operates the largest blood and eye banks in the Telugu states. The trust has restored eyesight to over 9,000 individuals through cornea transplants and provides 70% of collected blood free to the poor. It has received several accolades, including the &quot;Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award&quot; from the Government of Andhra Pradesh for five consecutive years from 2002 to 2006. In 2002, he was honoured with the Samman Award by the Income Tax Department, for being the highest income tax payer in the profession category for the assessment year 1999–2000.

In 2008, Chiranjeevi founded the Praja Rajyam Party and led it in the 2009 Andhra Pradesh elections, where it won 18 seats and secured over 16% of the vote, making it the third-largest party in the state. The party merged with the Indian National Congress in 2011. Chiranjeevi served as a Rajya Sabha MP from 2012 to 2018 and was appointed Minister of Tourism in the central cabinet of India in October 2012, holding the position until May 2014. After a hiatus from cinema, he returned with the blockbuster hit &quot;Khaidi No. 150&quot; (2017), followed by successful films such as &quot;Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy&quot; (2019) and &quot;Waltair Veerayya&quot; (2023).

==Early and personal life==
Chiranjeevi was born as Konidela Sivasankara Varaprasad Rao on 22 August 1955 in a Telugu family to Konidela Venkata Rao and Anjana Devi in Mogalthur, West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. His father Konidela Venkata Rao worked as a constable and was transferred on a regular basis. He spent his childhood in his native village with his grandparents.

Chiranjeevi did his schooling in Nidadavolu, Gurazala, Bapatla, Ponnur, Mangalagiri and Mogalthur. He was an NCC cadet and had participated in the Republic Day Parade in New Delhi in the early 1970s. He was interested in acting from a young age. He did his Intermediate at C. S. R. Sarma College in Ongole. After graduating with a degree in commerce from Sri Y N College at Narsapuram, Chiranjeevi moved to Chennai and joined the Madras Film Institute in 1976 to pursue a career in acting.

On 20 February 1980, Chiranjeevi married Surekha, the daughter of Telugu comic actor Allu Ramalingaiah. They have two daughters, Sushmitha and Sreeja, and a son, Ram Charan, also an actor in Telugu cinema. Chiranjeevi has two brothers, Nagendra Babu, a film producer and actor, and Pawan Kalyan, an actor-politician who is Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and founder of Jana Sena, a regional political party. Allu Aravind, his brother-in-law, is a film producer. Chiranjeevi is the uncle to actors Allu Arjun, Varun Tej, Niharika, Sai Dharam Tej, and Panja Vaisshnav Tej.

==Acting career==
===1978–1981: Early career===
Since his family worshipped Anjaneya (Hanuman), a Hindu deity, his mother advised him to take the screen name &quot;Chiranjeevi&quot;, meaning &quot;Immortal&quot;, a reference to the belief of Hanuman living forever.

Chiranjeevi started his film career with &quot;Punadhirallu&quot; (1979). However, his first released film was &quot;Pranam Khareedu&quot; (1978). &quot;Mana Voori Pandavulu&quot; (1978), directed by Bapu, gave Chiranjeevi recognition from the Telugu audience. He played a small role in &quot;Tayaramma Bangarayya&quot; (1979). He played the anti-hero in films &quot;I Love You&quot; (1979) and K. Balachander&#x27;s &quot;Idi Katha Kaadu&quot; (1979), starring Kamal Haasan.

In a remake of the Tamil film &quot;Avargal&quot; (1977), Chiranjeevi portrayed the character played by Rajinikanth in the original. In 1979, Chiranjeevi had eight major film releases and then 14 films in the following year. In 1981, he played lead antagonist in works such as &quot;Mosagadu&quot;, &quot;Rani Kasula Rangamma&quot;, &quot;47 Natkal&quot; /&quot;47 Rojulu&quot;, &quot;Nyayam Kavali&quot; and &quot;Ranuva Veeran&quot;.

=== 1982–1986: Breakthrough with leading roles ===
Chiranjeevi began to appear in leading roles with films such as (1982), directed by Kodi Ramakrishna, which was a hit at the box office. Later, he starred in &quot;Subhalekha&quot; (1982), directed by K. Viswanath, which dealt with the social malady of the dowry system. It brought him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and Viswanath&#x27;s third Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu. In 1982, he also appeared in movies such as &quot;Idi Pellantara&quot;, &quot;Sitadevi&quot;, &quot;Tingu Rangadu&quot;, &quot;Bandhalu Anubandhalu&quot; and &quot;Mondi Ghatam&quot;. He acted in multi-star movies such as &quot;Patnam Vachina Pativrathalu&quot; and &quot;Billa Ranga&quot;, and later appeared in &quot;Manchu Pallaki&quot;.

&quot;Khaidi&quot; (1983) was a box office success and Chiranjeevi attained stardom with this movie. In 1984, he continued doing action films. A series of box office hits at this time include; &quot;Mantri Gari Viyyankudu&quot;, &quot;Sangharshana&quot;, &quot;Goonda&quot;, &quot;Challenge&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Donga&quot;, &quot;Jwala&quot;, &quot;Adavi Donga&quot;, &quot;Kondaveeti Raja&quot;, &quot;Rakshasudu&quot;. In 1985, he received his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in &quot;Vijetha&quot;.

===1987–2007: Commercial success===
Chiranjeevi received his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for &quot;Swayamkrushi&quot; (1987), directed by K. Viswanath. &quot;Pasivadi Pranam&quot; (1987), &quot;Yamudiki Mogudu&quot; (1988) and &quot;Manchi Donga&quot; (1988) also did well at the box office. He co-produced and acted in &quot;Rudraveena&quot; (1988), which won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, and the Nandi Special Jury Award. The title &quot;Megastar&quot; appeared for the first time in the title cards of the 1988 release &quot;Marana Mrudangam&quot;, marking its association with Chiranjeevi. During the shoot of &quot;Marana Mrudangam&quot;, Chiranjeevi was poisoned by a fan who attempted to get closer to him. The incident was recalled by Chiranjeevi in 2023, who took it lightly as an act of misguided admiration.

He then experimented with &quot;Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari&quot; (1990), a fantasy film directed by K. Raghavendra Rao and produced by Aswini Dutt. Other notable works during this period include &quot;Kondaveeti Donga&quot; (1990), released in 70 mm format with 6-Track stereophonic sound, the cowboy film &quot;Kodama Simham&quot; (1990), and the social problem action film &quot;Gang Leader&quot; (1991). These films were major box-office successes and established Chiranjeevi as the &quot;Boss of Telugu cinema&quot;. The 1992 film &quot;Gharana Mogudu&quot; was the first South Indian and Telugu film to collect over 10 crore in distributor share at the box office. The film was screened at the 1993 International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section.

Chiranjeevi&#x27;s Bollywood performances were appreciated in &quot;Pratibandh&quot; and &quot;Aaj Ka Goonda Raaj&quot;. For his role in &quot;Aapadbandhavudu&quot; (1992), he received his second Nandi Award for Best Actor and third Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. The mid-1990s saw a career dip for Chiranjeevi with box office duds such as &quot;S. P. Parasuram&quot;, &quot;The Gentleman&quot;, &quot;Big Boss&quot; and &quot;Rikshavodu&quot;. There were exceptions, such as &quot;Muta Mestri&quot;, which fetched him a fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu; &quot;Mugguru Monagallu&quot; and &quot;Alluda Majaka&quot; were also successful. In 1996, he appeared in a guest role in the Kannada film &quot;Sipayi&quot;. After a brief lull, Chiranjeevi bounced back with &quot;Hitler&quot;, &quot;Master&quot;, &quot;Bavagaru Bagunnara?&quot;, &quot;Choodalani Vundi&quot; and &quot;Sneham Kosam&quot;, for which he received his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. In 1999, Chiranjeevi was to appear in a Hollywood production directed by Dushan Garsi, and produced by Rameshkrishna Murthi. The Telugu version was directed by Suresh Krissna. The movie, which was titled &quot;The Return of the Thief of Baghdad&quot;, had its filming suspended for undisclosed reasons.

Chiranjeevi&#x27;s new decade started with &quot;Annayya&quot; (2000). After a brief gap, Chiranjeevi starred in &quot;Indra&quot;, released in 2002, which broke all his previous box office records of Tollywood and won him his third Nandi Award for Best Actor and sixth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. After that, he appeared in films with an underlying message and a social cause, including &quot;Tagore;&quot; &quot;Shankar Dada M.B.B.S.&quot;, for which he won his seventh and latest Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu; and &quot;Stalin&quot;. He was awarded the Filmfare Special Award – South in 2006 and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award – South at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in 2011 for his contributions to the film industry.

=== 2008–2016: Hiatus in film career ===

Following his last film in the lead role, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Shankar Dada Zindabad&quot;, Chiranjeevi did not star in any film for approximately 10 years, during which he embarked on his political career. During these 10 years, his appearances in films were limited to cameo roles. He appeared as himself in two films, starring his son Ram Charan, namely &quot;Magadheera&quot; (2009) and &quot;Bruce Lee: The Fighter&quot; (2015). He also narrated &quot;Varudu&quot; (2010) and &quot;Rudhramadevi&quot; (2015).

=== 2017–present: Comeback ===
From 2013 onwards, he was on the lookout for the right script to mark his comeback into cinema, in what would coincidentally happen to be his 150th film as an actor. A year following the release of the highly successful 2014 Tamil film &quot;Kaththi&quot;, Chiranjeevi chose to remake that film in Telugu as his comeback film. The remake, titled &quot;Khaidi No. 150&quot;, directed by V. V. Vinayak, was released during the Sankranti holiday in 2017, about six months short of a decade following &quot;Shankar Dada Zindabad&quot;, to positive reviews. Critics have singled out Chiranjeevi in particular, praising him for both his performance and appearance, especially following a decade of absence from cinema. The movie collected 41.75 crore on its opening day and grossed 164 crore in its lifetime. In 2019, he starred in his first period film &quot;Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy&quot; based on the life of Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy; it was directed by Surender Reddy. The movie made on a budget more than 200270 crore, grossed more than in its theatrical run.

Chiranjeevi had two releases in 2022. His first film was &quot;Acharya&quot; directed by Koratala Siva co-starring Chiranjeevi&#x27;s son Ram Charan. His second release was &quot;GodFather&quot; directed by Mohan Raja. The film had Salman Khan in an extended cameo role and was largely successful. &quot;GodFather&quot; subsequently released on Netflix.

Chiranjeevi then starred in the 2023 film &quot;Waltair Veerayya&quot; directed by Bobby Kolli which released during the Sankranti festival. The film also starred Ravi Teja in an important role, reuniting them on screen after 23 years since the 2000 film &quot;Annayya&quot;. The film met huge commercial success. &quot;Waltair Veerayya&quot; later released on Netflix for streaming. In the same year, he also appeared in &quot;Bhola Shankar&quot;, a remake of the 2015 Tamil blockbuster, &quot;Vedalam&quot;. However, it opened to unanimously negative reviews and was a huge disaster at the box-office.

He announced his next film, &quot;Vishwambhara&quot; (2025), with Mallidi Vassishta of &quot;Bimbisara&quot; (2022) fame.

==Other work==
Chiranjeevi is one of the co-owners of the Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters FC.

=== Television career ===
Chiranjeevi made his debut as a Television host with the fourth season of &quot;Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu&quot;. The first episode of the fourth season was aired on 13 February 2017 on Star Maa. The game show is a Telugu-language adaptation of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;.

== Political career ==
In August 2008, Chiranjeevi launched his political party, Praja Rajyam Party, in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. At the launch, he stated that social justice was the main agenda of his party. In the 2009 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, the party won 18 of the 294 seats and secured a vote share of over 16%. He contested from Tirupati and Palakollu constituencies winning in Tirupati but losing out in Palakollu, in West Godavari district.

On 6 February 2011, the Praja Rajyam Party merged with the Indian National Congress after two weeks of talks with Congress President Sonia Gandhi. The merger was influenced by the Congress party&#x27;s concerns over a no-confidence motion in the Andhra Pradesh state assembly, spurred by the rise of Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy&#x27;s YSR Congress Party and the ongoing Telangana agitation. On 29 March 2012, Chiranjeevi was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, where he was elected and took his oath as a member on 3 April. Later that year, on 28 October, he was sworn in as the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Tourism. In 2013, Chiranjeevi inaugurated the Incredible India Exhibition, a collaboration between the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, at the 66th Cannes Film Festival. He also represented Incredible India at the 14th IIFA Awards ceremony held in Macau that same year.

After the split of the state of Andhra Pradesh leaving the residuary state with huge debt and little revenue in June 2014, most members of the Andhra Pradesh wing of Congress party left in protest. Chiranjeevi, however, remained with Congress and campaigned for it as chairman of Election Campaign Committee for 2014 parliamentary and assembly elections in the residual state of Andhra Pradesh. However, he refrained from contesting in elections. There was also speculation that he did not campaign wholeheartedly due to the one-sided decision taken to split Andhra Pradesh. His younger brother, Pawan Kalyan, a former Praja Rajyam Party youth wing leader, launched his own political party, Jana Sena Party, and campaigned vigorously against Congress and in favour of Telugu Desam Party and Bharatiya Janata Party. Due to the strong anti-Congress sentiment prevailing in Andhra Pradesh, its candidates were defeated in all parliamentary and state assembly seats of Andhra Pradesh.

Since the 2014 elections, he has stayed away from active politics and since then, has not attended any meetings of the Congress party, on a regional or national level. His tenure as a Rajya Sabha member ended in April 2018. Although he is currently not active in politics, he was issued with a new All India Congress Committee identity card in 2022 leading to the speculation of his political comeback.

== Humanitarian work ==
Chiranjeevi established the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust (CCT) on 2 October 1998, with the motto that no one should lose their life due to a lack of blood. The trust includes a blood bank and an eye bank and is the largest recipient of blood and eye donations in Andhra Pradesh. As of September 2022, CCT has collected over 930,000 units of blood, with 70% of it provided to the poor free of charge. It has restored eyesight to over 9,060 individuals through 4,580 cornea transplants, and more than 350,000 people have pledged their eyes to CCT. The trust has received several accolades, including the &quot;Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award&quot; from the Andhra Pradesh State Government for five consecutive years from 2002 to 2006. On 10 June 2006, the then President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, inaugurated the Chiranjeevi Charitable Foundation (CCF) at Jubilee Hills in Hyderabad. Chiranjeevi has supported the trust&#x27;s activities through his earnings, including those from television commercials and promotions.

After Chiranjeevi&#x27;s entry into politics, actor couple Rajasekhar and Jeevitha made allegations against the Chiranjeevi Blood Bank, accusing it of engaging in financial irregularities. In response, the Andhra Pradesh state government formed a high-level committee to investigate the claims. The committee, guided by the project director of the AP State AIDS Control Society and composed of experts from finance and technical fields, thoroughly examined records related to blood collection and disposal, blood grouping, screening, sterilization, medical waste management, conducted camps, blood expiry, quality control, storage facilities, and equipment purchases. Following the investigation, the blood bank was cleared of any wrongdoing. Authorities confirmed that the blood bank operates in full compliance with the guidelines set by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). In 2023, a Nampally court sentenced Rajasekhar and Jeevitha to one year in jail and imposed a fine of ₹5 lakh for their defamatory remarks against the blood bank. The couple, however, obtained bail.

In May 2021, Chiranjeevi set up oxygen banks and ambulances across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to meet the needs of patients affected by COVID-19.

<text>The integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT) is a power semiconductor electronic device, used for switching electric current in industrial equipment. It is related to the gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor.

It was jointly developed by Mitsubishi and ABB. Like the GTO thyristor, the IGCT is a fully controllable power switch, meaning that it can be turned both on and off by its control terminal (the gate). Gate drive electronics are integrated with the thyristor device.

== Device description ==
An IGCT is a special type of thyristor. It is made of the integration of the gate unit with the Gate Commutated Thyristor (GCT) wafer device. The close integration of the gate unit with the wafer device ensures fast commutation of the conduction current from the cathode to the gate. The wafer device is similar to a gate turn-off thyristor (GTO). They can be turned on and off by a gate signal, and withstand higher rates of voltage rise (dv/dt), such that no snubber is required for most applications.

The structure of an IGCT is very similar to a GTO thyristor. In an IGCT, the gate turn-off current is greater than the anode current. This results in a complete elimination of minority carrier injection from the lower PN junction and faster turn-off times. The main differences are a reduction in cell size, and a much more substantial gate connection with much lower inductance in the gate drive circuit and drive circuit connection. The very high gate currents and fast dI/dt rise of the gate current mean that regular wires can not be used to connect the gate drive to the IGCT. The drive circuit PCB is integrated into the package of the device. The drive circuit surrounds the device and a large circular conductor attaching to the edge of the IGCT is used. The large contact area and short distance reduce both the inductance and resistance of the connection.

The IGCT&#x27;s much faster turn-off times compared to the GTO&#x27;s allows it to operate at higher frequencies—up to several kHz for very short periods of time. However, because of high , typical operating frequency is up to 500 Hz.

Neutron-Transmutation-Doped Silicon used as the IGCT base substrate.

IGCTs, in high power applications, are sensitive to cosmic rays. To decrease cosmic ray induced malfunctions, more thickness in the n− base is required.

== Reverse bias ==
IGCT are available with or without reverse blocking capability. Reverse blocking capability adds to the forward voltage drop because of the need to have a long, low-doped P1 region.

IGCTs capable of blocking reverse voltage are known as symmetrical IGCT, abbreviated S-IGCT or SGCT. Usually, the reverse blocking voltage rating and forward blocking voltage rating are the same. The typical application for symmetrical IGCTs is in current source inverters.

IGCTs incapable of blocking reverse voltage are known as asymmetrical IGCT, abbreviated A-IGCT or AGCT. They typically have a reverse breakdown rating in the tens of volts. A-IGCTs are used where either a reverse conducting diode is applied in parallel (for example, in voltage source inverters) or where reverse voltage would never occur (for example, in switching power supplies or DC traction choppers).

Asymmetrical IGCTs can be fabricated with a reverse conducting diode in the same package. These are known as RC-IGCT, for reverse conducting IGCT.

== Applications ==
The main applications are in variable-frequency inverters, drives, traction and fast AC disconnect switches.
Multiple IGCTs can be connected in series or in parallel for higher power applications.

<text>Khasansky District () is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the twenty-two in Primorsky Krai, Russia. It is located in the southwest of the krai, wedged between the Tumen River and the Peter the Great Gulf, and shares a border with both China and North Korea. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the urban locality (an urban-type settlement) of Slavyanka. Population: The population of Slavyanka accounts for 39.5% of the district&#x27;s total population.

==Nature==
A significant part of the area is protected by the laws of Russia. The nature reserves include &quot;Kedrovaya Pad&quot;, established to protect the rare animals of South Primorye such as the Amur leopard, Siberian tiger, and Siberian Musk Deer; and the Far Eastern Marine Nature Reserve (1978), protecting the underwater world of the Peter the Great Gulf, including more than two thousand species of invertebrate animals (such as sea cucumber), approximately three hundred fish species, and larga seals.

==Economy==
Fishery and ship repair dominate the district&#x27;s economy. Mariculture development, medical sanitary bases establishment, and high class tourism development are considered to have potential here. Agriculture is specialized in breeding of animals for furs.

There are deposits of precious metals and construction sand, and Gusevskoye Deposit of porcelain stone which is used by the &quot;Porcelain of Primorye Works&quot; in the district.

There are several sea ports: Posyet, Zarubino, and Slavyanka, with transport passages to China and North Korea. The urban-type settlement of Khasan near Lake Khasan has a border crossing between Russia and North Korea.
