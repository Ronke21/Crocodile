<text>Montana State University (MSU) is a public land-grant research university in Bozeman, Montana, United States. It enrolls more students than any other college or university in the state. MSU offers baccalaureate degrees in 60 fields, master&#x27;s degrees in 68 fields, and doctoral degrees in 35 fields through its nine colleges. More than 16,700 students attended MSU in the fall 2019, taught by 796 full-time and 547 part-time faculty. In the Carnegie Classification, MSU is placed among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;, one of only two universities to receive this distinction with a &quot;very high undergraduate&quot; enrollment profile. The university had research expenditures of $257.9 million in 2024.

Located on the south side of Bozeman, the university&#x27;s campus is the largest in the state. The university&#x27;s main campus in Bozeman is home to KUSM television, KGLT radio, and the Museum of the Rockies. MSU provides outreach services to citizens and communities statewide through its agricultural experiment station and 60 county and reservation extension offices. The elevation of the campus is above sea level.

==History==

===Establishment of the college===

Montana became a state on 8 November 1889. Several cities competed intensely to be the state capital, the city of Bozeman among them. In time, the city of Helena was named the state capital. As a consolation, the state legislature agreed to put the state&#x27;s land-grant college in Bozeman. Gallatin County donated half of its 160-acre poor farm for the campus, and money for an additional 40 acres, which had been planned to hold a state capital, was raised by the community, including a $1,500 donation from rancher and businessman Nelson Story, Sr. This land, as well as additional property and monetary contributions, was now turned over to the state for the new college.

MSU was founded in 1893 as the Agricultural College of the State of Montana. It opened on 16 February with five male and three female students. The first classes were held in rooms in the county high school, and later that year in the shuttered Bozeman Academy (a private preparatory school). The first students were from Bozeman Academy and were forced to transfer to the college. Only two faculty existed on opening day: Luther Foster, a horticulturist from South Dakota who was also Acting President, and Homer G. Phelps, who taught business. Within weeks, they were joined by S.M. Emery (who ran the agricultural experiment station) and Benjamin F. Maiden (an English teacher from the former Bozeman Academy). Augustus M. Ryon, a coal mine owner, was named the first president of the college on 17 April 1893. Ryon immediately clashed with the board of trustees and faculty. Where the trustees wanted the college to focus on agriculture, Ryon pointed out that few of its students intended to go back to farming. While the rapidly expanding faculty wanted to establish a remedial education program to assist unprepared undergraduates (Montana&#x27;s elementary and secondary public education system was in dire shape at the time), Ryon refused. The donation of the Story land to the college occurred in 1894, but Ryon was forced out in 1895 and replaced by the James R. Reid, a Presbyterian minister who had been president of the Montana College at Deer Lodge since 1890.

The college grew quickly under Reid, who provided 10 years of stability and harmony. The student body grew so fast that the high school building was completely taken over by the college. A vacant store on Main Street was rented to provide additional classroom space. Both the Agricultural Experiment Station (now known as Taylor Hall) and the Main Building (now known as Montana Hall) were constructed in 1896, although the agricultural building was the first to open. Both structures were occupied in 1898. The university football team was established in 1897, and the college graduated its first four students that same year. The curriculum expanded into civil and electrical engineering in 1898.

===Expansion and growth under Hamilton and Atkinson===

Reid resigned for health reasons in 1905 and was succeeded by James M. Hamilton, an economist. Determined to make the college into a school of technology, he rapidly expanded the curriculum areas such as biology, chemistry, engineering, geology, and physics. Hamilton also devised the university motto, &quot;Education for Efficiency&quot;, which the college continued to use until the 1990s. Further marking this change in direction, the school was officially renamed the Montana College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1913 (although that name was in widespread use as early as 1894). The college&#x27;s first great rapid expansion of physical plants also began under Hamilton. Constructed during this time were Linfield Hall (1908), Hamilton Hall (1910), and Traphagen Hall (1919). The giant whitewashed &quot;M&quot; on the side of Mount Baldy in the foothills of the Bridger Range was first built in 1916, and in 1917 ROTC came to campus for the first time.
Hamilton resigned in 1919 to become Dean of Men, and his successor was agricultural expert Alfred Atkinson. Atkinson&#x27;s tenure lasted 17 years (1920 to 1937). A firm believer in Hamilton&#x27;s vision for the school, Atkinson worked hard to continue the rapid expansion of the campus. The iconic, barrel-vaulted Gymnasium Building (now Romney Hall) was built in 1922, replacing a dilapidated &quot;drill hall&quot; and giving the school&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team its first home court. The Heating Plant, Lewis Hall, and Roberts Hall followed in 1923. By the 1920s, the school was commonly referred to as Montana State College (MSC). Herrick Hall followed in 1926. The college was justifiably proud of its academic accomplishments, but its sports teams entered a golden age as well. In 1922, Atkinson hired George Ott Romney and Schubert Dyche as co-head coaches of the football and men&#x27;s basketball teams. Between 1922 and 1928 (the year he departed Montana for Brigham Young University), Romney&#x27;s football teams compiled a 28–20–1 record. This included the 1924 season in which his team went undefeated until the final game of the year. As a co-head basketball coach, Romney&#x27;s teams compiled a 144–31 record and invented the fast break. After Romney left, Schubert Dyche coached the &quot;Golden Bobcats&quot; team of 1928, which had a 36–2 record and won the national championship. In his seven years as a basketball coach, Dyche&#x27;s teams compiled a 110–93 record (this included the dismal 1932–33 and 1933–34 seasons), but won their conference championship twice. In 1930, the college built Gatton Field, a football field on what is now the site of the Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center. In one of President Atkinson&#x27;s last accomplishments, the Dormitory Quadrangle (now Atkinson Quadrangle) was built.

The first three decades of the 20th century were rowdy ones on the college campus. Bozeman had a large red-light district by 1900, alcohol was plentiful and cheap, and there was little in the way of organized entertainment such as theaters to occupy the student body. President Reid spent much of his presidency cracking down on dancing, drinking, gambling, and prostitution by students. President Hamilton sought to improve the atmosphere for women by building Hamilton Hall, which was not only the first on-campus housing for students but also the first all-women&#x27;s housing on campus. Access by men to Hamilton Hall was strictly limited to young teenage boys (who acted as servants); adult males were permitted only in the first-floor lounge, and only on Sundays. Atkinson Quadrangle was built on the location of the College Inn, also known as the &quot;Bobcat Lair,&quot; a popular student drinking and dancing hangout.

===Depression and World War II===

The college suffered greatly during the Great Depression. The price of agricultural products (Montana&#x27;s economic mainstay) soared during World War I, as European and Russian farms were devastated by military campaigns, in which American and European armies demanded food. For a few years after the war, these prices remained high. But as European agriculture began to improve, an agricultural depression swamped the United States beginning in about 1923. State tax revenues plunged, and fewer buildings were constructed on campus after 1923.

===The Renne years===

In 1943, the state board of higher education appointed MSC economist Roland &quot;Rollie&quot; Renne to be the new acting president of the college. Renne was a strong proponent of the New Deal. He&#x27;d taught at MSC since 1930, although he&#x27;d taken a leave of absence in 1942 to become the director of Montana&#x27;s Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply (a federal wartime agency). Renne was named the permanent president of the college on 1 July 1944.

Renne was president of the college for 21 years, the third-longest of any individual (as of 2013). With the passage of the G.I. Bill Just eight days before his appointment and the end of the war in sight, Renne realized that servicemen returning from the war were going to flood college campuses. Renne quickly began hiring additional faculty and recycled wartime wooden buildings from around the state to build temporary classrooms and housing spaces. His foresight helped the college survive the rapid rise in enrollment, which doubled from 1,155 in 1945 to 2,014 in 1946 and then nearly doubled again in 1947 to 3,591. Faculty numbers also skyrocketed, from 132 in 1945 to 257 in 1950. Believing that a college education was as much about instilling democratic values as teaching skills and trades, Renne rapidly changed the curriculum to emphasize liberal arts such as anthropology, archeology, history, political science, psychology, and sociology. Although the University of Montana (long considered the state&#x27;s &quot;liberal arts college&quot;, while MSC was the &quot;ag school&quot;) opposed much expansion in this area, Renne successfully established a Department of Education, reconstituted the School of Business, and established new undergraduate and graduate programs in architecture, geography, geology, military science, and other disciplines.
Throughout the 1950s, Renne worked to rapidly expand the college&#x27;s physical plant. During his presidency, 18 major buildings were constructed on campus — more than double the number that had been built between 1893 and 1944, and almost as many as were built between 1966 and 2013. These included the 1949 Library Building (now Renne Library), the campus&#x27; first dedicated library (it had previously been housed in a few rooms on the second floor of Montana Hall), and the 1958 Brick Breeden Fieldhouse.

There was some criticism that Renne did not pay full attention to the college in the 1950s. His governance style was somewhat authoritarian, and his extended absences led to leadership vacuums. He agreed to consulting roles with the Water Resources Policy Commission, Mutual Security Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United States Department of State, and the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare throughout the 1950s that often took him away from campus for weeks at a time. He took a leave of absence from the college to become Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs from 1963 to 1964.

Renne resigned as president of Montana State College effective 1 January 1964, to run for Governor of Montana. He lost the election, 51.4 to 48.6 percent, to the incumbent governor Tim Babcock.

===University status and campus conservatism===

In February 1964, Leon H. Johnson was appointed president of MSC. A research chemist who joined the college in 1943, he had most recently been the executive director of the school&#x27;s Endowed and Research Foundation (at the time, MSC&#x27;s largest research unit) and Dean of the Graduate Division. Deeply committed to the college&#x27;s research function, he pushed for MSC to be named a university — a change Renne had since the early 1950s, and which the Montana state legislature approved on 1 July 1965. At that time, the school received its new name, Montana State University (MSU). Bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in economics, English, history, music, political science, and other disciplines were quickly established, as was the first university honors program. Johnson was a devoted admirer of the arts, and MSU&#x27;s art and music programs blossomed. Johnson quickly worked to end the acrimonious relationship with the University of Montana, and the two schools began to present a united front to the state legislature.

In 1966, Johnson altered and enlarged the university&#x27;s administrative structure to help cope with increasing enrollment and increasing campus complexity. These changes included creating a 12-member executive council to advise him. The council included newly created vice presidents — overseeing areas such as academic affairs, administration, finance, and research.

Johnson was deeply conservative — fiscally, socially, and politically. He was deeply committed to continuing Renne&#x27;s educational plan but declined to spend money on new buildings (preferring to consolidate and renovate rather than expand). He also continued Renne&#x27;s policies largely barring from campus speakers who were not clearly in the political mainstream. Johnson&#x27;s policies were largely supported by the student body and the taxpaying public. MSU practiced a policy known as &quot;in loco parentis&quot;, in which it acted as a &quot;parent&quot; toward the &quot;children&quot; attending school there. To that end, Johnson instituted dress codes, required adult chaperones at dances, banned alcohol, and instituted mandatory military training for freshmen and sophomores. Although many American college campuses were engulfed by student radicalism, MSU&#x27;s student body was as conservative as Johnson was and accepted these restrictions. For many years, the biggest issues on campus were ending Saturday morning classes and building student parking lots.

There were some campus protests, however. The first protest against the Vietnam War occurred in 1966 (drawing about 100 students), two underground student newspapers briefly appeared, and some students organized clubs to debate issues of the day. There were minor faculty and student protests when Johnson attempted to prevent English professor James Myers from assigning students to read James Baldwin&#x27;s novel &quot;Another Country&quot;, and in the summer of 1968 a few faculty organized a symposium on the war. When about 150 students rallied in front of Montana Hall in 1969 to ask for co-ed and &quot;open visitation&quot; dorms (e.g., to allow men into women&#x27;s dorm rooms, and vice versa), Johnson threatened to call out the city police.

MSU&#x27;s Bobcat Stadium saw its genesis during the Johnson years. Growing student unrest over the football team&#x27;s use of decrepit Gatton Field (while the basketball team used modern Brick Breeden Fieldhouse) led to a proposal by Johnson in April 1968 to build a 16,000-seat stadium funded by student fees. The proposal failed in December 1968 after students argued that the university should concurrently build a new fitness center as well.

President Johnson died of a heart attack on 18 June 1969. He&#x27;d suffered a heart attack in October 1968 and then underwent surgery out of state in April 1969.

William Johnstone, a professor of education and Vice President for Administration at MSU, took over as Acting President. He was the first and (as of 2013) the only Montanan to become president of MSU. Johnstone pledged to build the fitness center first, and in December 1969 the student body approved the finance plan for the new football stadium. On 2 April 1970, about 250 students engaged in a sit-in in Montana Hall to protest Myers&#x27; termination, but it ended peacefully a day later. Myers was terminated, and another eight faculty resigned in protest. But during his year in office, the university completed Cobleigh Hall (ironically named for the last individual to be named acting president).

===Tough fiscal times of the 1970s===

Carl W. McIntosh was named MSU&#x27;s eighth president in June 1970. Previously the president of 28,000-student California State University, Long Beach, McIntosh brought a consultative and deliberate style of decision-making to the university. He faced a poor fiscal climate: The state was entering a decade-long depression brought about by a steep drop in commodity prices, the state&#x27;s higher education system had grown too large and unwieldy, and Governor Thomas L. Judge had established a blue-ribbon committee to close several of the state&#x27;s colleges. In 1974, women faculty at MSU sued, alleging gender discrimination. They won their suit in 1976, leading to a $400,000 damages award, a back-pay award, and extensive promotions (which also increased salaries). To accommodate these fiscal realities, McIntosh ordered several doctoral and master&#x27;s degree programs terminated, and all advanced degree programs in the social sciences and liberal arts canceled.

But McIntosh also scored several successes. In 1972, he persuaded the legislature to allow MSU to participate in the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) medical education program, which allowed 20 (now 30) Montana citizens per year to begin medical school at MSU before completing studies at the University of Washington. The College of nursing (Sherrick Hall) was finished in 1973, and after three long years of construction, Reno H. Sales Stadium (now Bobcat Stadium and Martel Field) and the Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center both opened. In 1974, the long-planned Creative Arts Complex (Cheever Hall, Haynes Hall, and Howard Hall) was also completed. Unfortunately, major increases in inflation led to significant design changes. Instead of a 1,200-seat concert hall with superb acoustics, a cramped and aurally dead 260-seat auditorium was built. Finally, in 1976, the university completed the new medical science building, Leon Johnson Hall.

In 1976, the &quot;hidden million&quot; controversy ended McIntosh&#x27;s tenure as president. In 1975, Montana&#x27;s first Commissioner of Higher Education, Lawrence K. Pettit (a former MSU professor of political science) launched an investigation of several Montana colleges and universities. He was particularly interested in MSU, where McIntosh&#x27;s laid-back governance style was widely considered to have hurt the university. In March 1976, Pettit announced he was confiscating $1 million in surplus student fees from MSU — money he argued the university was trying to hide from state auditors and the legislature. The monies were the result of excessively high enrollment in the 1974–1975 school year and were intended to help see the university through the 1975–1976 school year (when the legislature would not meet, and thus could not provide the needed budgetary boost to handle the over-enrollment). Pettit all but accused MSU and McIntosh of fraud, and McIntosh refused to attack Pettit&#x27;s statements as mischaracterizations and slander. The public outcry about the &quot;hidden million&quot; led the board of regents to request McIntosh&#x27;s resignation on 30 June 1977, which he tendered. (Pettit resigned the following year, his combative attempt to turn the commissioner&#x27;s office into a sort of chancellorship having failed.)

===Resurgence and retrenchment under Tietz===
William Tietz, MSU&#x27;s ninth president, arrived in August 1977 just as economic conditions in the state were improving. With three of the four vice presidencies at the university open, Tietz imposed his stamp on the administration almost immediately. This included a strong emphasis on research, faculty development, better teaching, and diversity (particularly for Native Americans, the handicapped, and women). His aggressiveness, energy, and immediate re-budgeting of funds into faculty sabbaticals helped win over professors, who voted against unionization in 1978. Tietz&#x27;s major goal, increasing research funding, was greatly helped by a 1981 decision of the legislature to refund indirect cost payments back to the university. This led to an immediate 15 percent recovery of federal funds, and in time private foundation funding rose significantly as well.

Only two buildings were constructed during Tietz&#x27;s presidency — the Visual Communications Building in 1983 and the Plant Growth Center in 1987. Most of his focus as president was on raising salaries. A third building, the modern home of the Museum of the Rockies, opened in 1989. But this structure was paid for by bonds. Faculty salaries had declined 23 percent during the 1970s (due to wage freezes) and MSU was in the bottom 10 percent of salaries for faculty nationwide. Cooperative Extension Service salaries were dead last in the nation. The state legislature implemented a new salary funding formula that rectified many of these problems. Some university programs were also re-established, such as the honors program, and some new ones were formed, such as the Writing Center.

The state once more entered a severe economic downturn in the mid-1980s. Budget cuts totaling nearly 10 percent, coupled with an enrollment shortfall, led to significant retrenchment. Tietz argued MSU should focus on its strongest programs. Thus, a wide array of programs were terminated: Membership in the Center for Research Libraries; sports like skiing, women&#x27;s gymnastics, and wrestling; degree programs like engineering science, business education, and industrial arts; and the office of institutional research. Departments were merged and downsized, and Tietz proposed closing the School of Architecture. A battle broke out to save it, and Tietz backed off his decision. Tietz increasingly blamed Governor Ted Schwinden for a failure to support higher education, and lashed out repeatedly against the governor when Schwinden publicly ridiculed MSU&#x27;s new Tech Park (a project designed to function as a technology incubator). Although a second faculty unionization effort failed in 1989, Tietz resigned in March 1990, frustrated by the constant battles with an &quot;old guard&quot; resistant to turning MSU toward high technology.

===Centennial and expansion===

Michael P. Malone was named MSU&#x27;s Acting President on 1 January 1991, and permanently appointed to the position in March 1991, Malone was named MSU&#x27;s 10th president. He had served as MSU&#x27;s Dean of Graduate Studies from 1979 to 1988, and then three one-year temporary appointments as vice president for Academic Affairs while a fruitless national search occurred for a permanent replacement. As Dean of Graduate Studies, he&#x27;d been critical of what he perceived as the state&#x27;s unwillingness to invest in high technology education.

Malone&#x27;s governance style was democratic, friendly, and personal. His friendly style made him personally popular with legislators and earned their respect. Nonetheless, he was criticized for focusing too much on how little money MSU had and for criticizing the legislature too much for not investing in higher education.

Malone was the first MSU president to preside over the Billings, Great Falls, and Havre campuses. On 1 July 1994, Montana restructured the Montana University System. Eastern Montana College in Billings, Montana Northern College in Havre, and the Vocational-Technical Center in Great Falls lost their independence and were made satellite campuses of Montana State University. Although Montana&#x27;s seven tribal colleges remained independent (as they are sponsored by sovereign nations), the state required them to integrate their teaching, operations, and academic operations with both Montana State University and the University of Montana to continue to receive state funding.

Montana State University celebrated its centennial in 1993. A university history called &quot;In the People&#x27;s Interest: A Centennial History of Montana State University&quot; was published to celebrate the centennial, authored by three Montana State history professors--Jeffrey J. Safford, Pierce Mullen, and Robert Rydell. 
During Malone&#x27;s presidency, Montana State University witnessed &quot;one of the greatest expansions in campus history&quot;, as a large number of new buildings were constructed. These included the $1 million Centennial Mall (1993), the $22 million Engineering and Physical Sciences Building (1997), the $10 million Bobcat Stadium renovation, the $13.5 million renovation of Brick Breeden Fieldhouse, the $12 million Agricultural Biosciences Building (1999), and the $7.5 million Renne Library renovation (1999). A strong sports fan, Malone&#x27;s focus extended to sports personnel as well as sports facilities. In 1999, he fired Bobcats football head coach Cliff Hysell after eight losing seasons and hired Mike Kramer, the winning coach at Eastern Washington University. In October 1999, he fired MSU women&#x27;s basketball head coach Tracey Sheehan and assistant coach Jeff Malby after an NCAA investigation revealed that the two coaches were overworking their team and causing injuries to student-athletes.

Like William Tietz before him, Malone also pushed hard for faculty and the university to seek and win federal funding for scientific research. Federal research funding grew from just $13 million in the late 1980s to more than $50 million in 1999. The undergraduate curriculum was revamped, enrollment hit a historic high of 11,746 students in 1999, and the Burns Telecommunications Center was established. Malone benefitted from a strong economy that eased many of the fiscal pressures Tietz faced. He expanded alumni fund-raising programs and pushed the MSU Foundation to redouble its fund-raising efforts. But the legislature was not forthcoming with salary increases. He weathered a strike by clerical and administrative support staff in 1992. He was later criticized, however, for initiating projects without having the money to complete them and then using the subsequent construction crisis to raise the funds to finish the project. Tuition doubled during his time in office, angering students, and some faculty criticized his willingness to construct new buildings while declining to pay for teaching equipment.

The MSU community was shocked when Malone died of a heart attack on 21 December 1999, at Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport. He was the second MSU president to die in office, and the second to die of heart failure.

===Twenty-first century stability===

Malone&#x27;s successor, Geoffrey Gamble, was named the 11th president of Montana State University on 5 October 2000. His governance style was open and consultative. In addition to making the president&#x27;s executive council more representative and reaching out to the Faculty Senate, he established a new 25-member University Planning, Budget, and Analysis Committee to establish the university budget. Legislatively, Gamble promoted MSU&#x27;s accomplishments, praised legislators for their financial support (even when it was not forthcoming), and spoke of state funding for the university in terms of investment that led to economic and job growth. According to Cathy Conover, MSU&#x27;s chief legislative lobbyist, Gamble&#x27;s style was &quot;a sea change&quot; that led the Republican-dominated state legislature to rave about him.

Montana State University also implemented the &quot;Core 2.0 curriculum&quot; during Gamble&#x27;s tenure as president. This program encourages undergraduate students to engage in research or practice their art before graduation.

Gamble also focused on research. Between 2000 and 2009, federal research funding at MSU grew by 61 percent to $98.4 million. Gamble trademarked the name &quot;University of the Yellowstone&quot; to reflect the high level of research MSU conducted in the greater Yellowstone National Park ecosystem.

Gamble also made diversity a major effort in his presidency. He appointed the university&#x27;s first permanent female vice president, and by 2009 women outnumbered men among MSU&#x27;s deans, five to four. He appointed Henrietta Mann (chair of the MSU Department of Native American Studies, and one of the most prominent Indian educators in the United States) his representative to the seven tribal colleges which participate in the Montana University System and created a Council of Elders to bring leaders of the tribal colleges together twice a year at MSU for discussions. Native American enrollment at MSU rose 79 percent (to a historic high of 377 students) during Gamble&#x27;s time in office.

In 2006, a major sports scandal engulfed Montana State University. On 30 June 2006, former MSU basketball player Branden Miller and former MSU football player John LeBrum were charged with murdering local cocaine dealer Jason Wright. After an 18-month investigation, six additional current and former MSU athletes were charged with buying and selling cocaine. Three of the six were charged with running a cocaine smuggling ring that sold of cocaine in Bozeman between June 2005 to May 2007.

Court records later revealed that some MSU coaches knew Miller carried handguns in his athletic bag at school and that the murder weapon and other handguns had been secreted in Brick Breeden Fieldhouse. In August 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ran a front-page article, &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;, that recounted drug use, violence, theft, intimidation, and illegal activities by current and former MSU student-athletes and the complicity of the low-level coaching staff. An investigation by the NCAA revealed significantly lower graduation rates for MSU football and basketball players under football coach Mike Kramer as well as men&#x27;s basketball coach Mick Durham, and a large number of athletes on or flirting with academic probation. Gamble quickly fired Kramer, who then sued MSU for unlawful dismissal. Kramer and MSU settled out of court, and Kramer received a payment of $240,000. In 2009, Gamble said his hardest time as president was dealing with the sports scandal.

Gamble announced his retirement on 22 March 2009.

===Record growth===
Waded Cruzado, the former president of New Mexico State University, succeeded Gamble as president, taking office on 4 January 2010. Since her arrival, the university&#x27;s headcount enrollment has grown from 13,559 in the fall of 2010 to a record 16,902 in the fall of 2018 – a 24.66 percent increase – making MSU the largest university in the state of Montana.

In addition to enrollment increases, the campus has seen the completion of numerous major construction and renovation projects since Cruzado&#x27;s arrival. In the fall of 2010, the university reopened one of its most heavily used classroom buildings on campus, Gaines Hall, after a $32 million renovation funded by the Montana Legislature.

That same fall, the university opened its new, 40,000-square-foot Animal Bioscience Building. The $15.7 million building was funded, in part, by donations from Montana&#x27;s livestock and grains industry. In addition to classroom and teaching laboratory space, the building is home to the MSU College of Agriculture&#x27;s Department of Animal and Range Sciences.

While the Gaines Hall renovation and the Animal Biosciences building were underway before Cruzado took office, in the fall of 2010 she launched an ambitious 90-day campaign to raise $6 million in private donations for a $10 million project to replace and expand the 38-year-old south end zone of the university&#x27;s football stadium. The university would cover the remaining $4 million for the project, paying it back from revenues generated by MSU Athletics, including ticket sales. The campaign was successful and resulted in a new end zone opening for the fall 2011 season. The end zone project resulted in a net gain of 5,200 seats for the stadium for a total capacity of 17,500. However, through additional standing-room-only attendance, the stadium thrice exceeded 21,000 spectators in the fall of 2013.

The fall of 2010 also marked the official opening of Gallatin College Programs at MSU, offering two-year degrees. The program was previously known as MSU-Great Falls College of Technology in Bozeman and was located away from the central campus, but with the renaming, Gallatin College was also given offices and classrooms in Hamilton Hall, located in the campus center. The program&#x27;s first dean, Bob Hietala, oversaw a period of steady enrollment growth, with Gallatin College growing from 100 students at its start to more than 800 in fall 2019. The program also expanded into new spaces, leasing empty classrooms in the local high school and space in a commercial building off-campus.

MSU marked its 125th anniversary in 2018 with a year of celebratory events. Several thousand attended daylong events on 16–17 Feb. featuring family activities, music, fireworks, and speeches commemorating the university&#x27;s history. A newly installed statue of Abraham Lincoln by Bozeman-area artist Jim Dolan was unveiled at a ceremony honoring the former president&#x27;s contributions to land-grant universities.

In November 2019, the board of regents voted to raise Cruzado&#x27;s salary by $150,000, citing her performance as president and amid reports Cruzado had received a larger offer from another university. Cruzado declined to name the university that wanted to hire her. The 50% raise received support for putting Cruzado&#x27;s salary in line with other universities&#x27; presidents&#x27; salaries but also criticism given Montana&#x27;s median salary ($53,000) and the pay of lower-level employees. In 2020, Cruzado&#x27;s salary stood at $476,524 per year.

Severe snow and cold during the winter of 2019 contributed to the collapses of two gymnasium roofs at the university&#x27;s Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center. The center&#x27;s south gym roof fell during the early morning hours of 7 March, followed two days later by the north gym roof. No one was injured in the collapses, and the entire fitness center is in the process of being rebuilt. Two inflatable gym structures, known as North and South Dome, exist as temporary replacements until the new Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center is completed.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 forced Montana&#x27;s public university system to switch to online and remote course delivery midway through the spring semester. To help stem the spread of the disease, the university canceled events, encouraged students not to return after spring break, and asked employees to work from home, essentially emptying the campus. The in-person spring commencement ceremony was also replaced by an online alternative.

===Allegations of civil rights violations===
In October 2023, Montana State officials were notified that the institution was under investigation by the US Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights for discrimination related to the administration&#x27;s handling of an incident involving death threats received by members of the Queer Straight Alliance, a registered campus student organization, in the Spring of 2023 it was reported that more than 20 students filed complaints with the Federal Agency. 

Two months later, the university was informed that it faced additional allegations, this time about failing to adequately respond to complaints of harassment made by female and Jewish students on campus. The following month, federal agencies informed university officials of a third civil rights investigation related to allegations of discrimination against a student who had reported incidents of sexual harassment. One month after that notification, MSU received a fourth notice of investigation from the Deptment of Education, alleging discrimination against students with disabilities. This time, the notice was accompanied by a warning from investigators:

Also in February 2024, a team of Department of Education lawyers and investigators visited the Bozeman campus and met with select students and administrators to discuss allegations of civil rights violations on campus. At the time of the visit, there were 11 pending Department of Education investigations of violations at Montana State, some going back as far as 2016.

The university is in the top 3 percent of colleges and universities in the United States in research expenditures and regularly reports annual research expenditures over $100 million, including a record $138.8 million in the fiscal year that ended in June 2019. In that same year the university said its faculty wrote 1,100 grant proposals, which led to grant awards worth about $485 million which will be spent over several years.

MSU&#x27;s Office of Research and Economic Development coordinates programs that encourage faculty to pursue externally funded research. Its Office of Research Compliance oversees programs that promote ethical and responsible research and ensures compliance with local, state, and federal regulations for research. The Office of Sponsored programs manages financial, reporting, compliance, auditing, and related tasks for externally funded research.

The university maintains a technology transfer office to commercialize MSU faculty inventions, spur businesses based on those technologies, and network with businesses looking to license MSU technologies. The office manages more than 500 technologies and 375 patents, trademarks, and copyrights.

The Renne Library--or the Montana State University Library--contains, (in addition to supporting the research and information needs of Montana State faculty, students, and the Montana Extension Service) a department dedicated to manuscript materials, photographs, and other historical ephemera called the Merrill G. Burlingame Archives and Special Collections, or the Montana State University Archives and Special Collections.

== Air Force ROTC Detachment 450 ==
Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) Detachment 450 at Montana State University (MSU) hosts the 450th AFROTC Cadet Wing. It was activated in 1952 and has approximately 110 cadets.

==Athletics==
The MSU athletic teams are nicknamed the Bobcats, and they participate in NCAA Division I (I-FCS for football) in the Big Sky Conference, of which Montana State University is a charter member. They field 13 varsity sports. Originally playing as the &quot;Aggies,&quot; men&#x27;s teams compete in football, basketball, track, cross-country, skiing, rodeo and tennis. Women&#x27;s teams include volleyball, basketball, track, cross-country, tennis, golf, rodeo, and skiing.

Montana State University has won several national championships in men&#x27;s rodeo, three national championships in football, and one national championship in men&#x27;s basketball. Non-varsity (club) sports include rugby, men&#x27;s hockey, men&#x27;s lacrosse, baseball, fencing and ultimate frisbee. Montana State University has an ongoing rivalry with the University of Montana, most notably the cross-state football matchup, known as the &quot;Brawl of the Wild&quot;, but also includes the cross-state club lacrosse matchup, known as the &quot;Copper Cup&quot;.

===Basketball===

The school&#x27;s basketball teams achieved fame throughout the 1920s by playing &quot;racehorse basketball&quot; and becoming one of the first schools in the nation to employ what is known as the fast break. Montana State College coach Ott Romney, who graduated with a Master from MSC before World War I, pioneered the style of play, and by 1926 had assembled a team suited to playing an up-tempo brand of ball. Cat Thompson, John &quot;Brick&quot; Breeden, Frank Ward, Val Glynn, and Max Worthington were at the heart of the MSC team that won the Rocky Mountain Conference title three straight seasons, and bested Utah State, BYU, Colorado, and University of Denver. The 1928–29 team defeated the AAU Champion Cook&#x27;s Painters in a two-of-three series, winning the Rocky Mountain Conference title. The team was named National Champions by the Helms Foundation, which also named Cat Thompson one of the five greatest players in the first half of the 20th century in college hoops.

===Football===

In 1956 the Bobcats football team took a share of the NAIA championship in the Aluminum Bowl in Little Rock, Arkansas playing to a 0–0 tie with the Pumas of St. Joseph&#x27;s College from Rensselaer, Indiana. In 1976 the Bobcats of Montana State won a national football title in NCAA Division II at Wichita Falls, Texas beating the Zips of Akron, Ohio 24–13 in the title game. In 1984, the Bobcats returned to a national football title game played in Charleston, South Carolina, beating the Bulldogs of Louisiana Tech 19-6 for their third national football title. The MSU Bobcats football is the only college team with national titles in three different classifications. The team has won 20 conference titles and has made the NCAA FCS playoffs in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

<text>The Western region, located in south Ghana, spreads from the Ivory Coast (Comoé District) in the west to the Central region in the east, includes the capital and large twin city of Sekondi-Takoradi on the coast, coastal Axim, and a hilly inland area including Elubo. It includes Ghana&#x27;s southernmost location, Cape Three Points, where crude oil was discovered in commercial quantities in June 2007. The region covers an area of 13,842 km2, and had a population of 2,060,585 at the 2021 Census. It has a coastline that stretches from South Ghana&#x27;s border with the Ivory Coast to the boundary with the Central region on the east.

==Tourism==
The largest rivers are the Ankobra River, the Bia River, and the Pra River in the east, with the Tano River partly forming the western national border. The area is known for the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the village of Nzulezo built entirely on stilts and platforms over water and the Ankasa Protected Area. There is a series of imposing Portuguese, Dutch, British, and Brandenburgian forts along the coast, built from 1512 on.

The region is an Akan region comprised Wassa, Ahanta, and Nzema. Wassa is the largest tribe in the region. However, the popular language spoken in the region is Fanti. 
The Western region boasts many beaches and mining companies. The popular Ghana Gold fields mine is located in the region at Tarkwa.

==Education==
The Western region has many post-secondary schools, including teachers&#x27; and nursing colleges, and two universities--University of Mines and Technology (in Tarkwa) and Takoradi Technical University (formerly known as Takoradi Polythecnic).

==Administrative divisions==
Before the regional demarcation in December 2018, the region had 23 MMDA&#x27;s (made up of 1 Metropolitan, 11 Municipal and 11 Ordinary Assemblies). Therefore, as part of this reorganisation, nine MMDA&#x27;s (those in bold and asterisks below, which were 3 Municipal and 6 Ordinary Assemblies) were removed from the Western region and formed into a new Western North region with its new capital at Wiawso.

The political administration of the region is through the local government system. Under this administration system, the region is divided into 14 MMDA&#x27;s (made up of 1 Metropolitan, 8 Municipal and 5 Ordinary Assemblies). Each District, Municipal or Metropolitan Assembly, is administered by a Chief Executive, representing the central government but deriving authority from an Assembly headed by a presiding member elected from among the members themselves. The current list is as follows:

Usually these weapons are firearms or some other long-range weapons, and can be used in combination with other tools such as grenades for indirect offense, armor for additional defense, or accessories such as telescopic sights to modify the behavior of the weapons. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition, armor or health, or upgrades which augment the player character&#x27;s weapons.

Shooter games test the player&#x27;s spatial awareness, reflexes, and speed in both isolated single player or networked multiplayer environments. Shooter games encompass many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar engaging in combat with a weapon against both code-driven NPC enemies or other avatars controlled by other players.

== Subgenres ==

=== Shoot &#x27;em up ===


Shoot &#x27;em ups (also known as shmups) are a subgenre of shooters wherein the player may move, up, down, left or right around the screen, typically firing straight forward.

Shoot &#x27;em ups share common gameplay, but are often categorized by viewpoint. This includes fixed shooters on fixed screens, such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot;; scrolling shooters that mainly scroll in a single direction, such as &quot;Xevious&quot; and &quot;Darius&quot;; top-down shooters (sometimes referred to as twin-stick shooters) where the levels are controlled from an overhead viewpoint, such as &quot;Bosconian&quot; and &quot;Time Pilot&quot;; rail shooters where player movement is automatically guided down a fixed forward-scrolling &quot;rail&quot;, such as &quot;Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom&quot; and &quot;Space Harrier&quot;; and isometric shooters which use an isometric perspective, such as &quot;Zaxxon&quot; and &quot;Viewpoint&quot;.

==== Run and gun ====
Run and gun video games are 2D scrolling action games in which the protagonists fight on foot, often with the ability to jump. Run and gun games may use side-scrolling, vertical scrolling or isometric viewpoints and may feature multidirectional movement.

Top-down run and gun games use an overhead camera angle that shows players and the areas around them from above. Notable games in this category include &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, &quot;Shock Troopers&quot; and &quot;Shock Troopers: 2nd Squad&quot;.

Side-scrolling run and gun games combine elements of both shoot &#x27;em up and platform games, while the player characters move and jump around shooting with various guns and other long-range weapons. These games emphasize greater maneuvering or even jumping, such as &quot;Green Beret&quot;, &quot;Thexder&quot;, &quot;Contra&quot; and &quot;Metal Slug&quot;.

=== Shooting gallery ===
Shooting gallery games (also known as &quot;target shooting&quot; games) are a sub-genre of shooters where the player aims at moving targets on a stationary screen. They are distinguished from rail shooters, which move the player through levels on a fixed path, and first-person shooters, which allow player-guided navigation through a three-dimensional space.

Shooting gallery games can be light gun games and rail-shooters, although many can also be played using a regular joypad and an on-screen cursor to signify where the bullets are being aimed. When these debuted, they were typically played from a first-person perspective, with enemy fire that occurred anywhere on the screen damaging or killing the player. As they evolved away from the use of light guns, the player came to be represented by an on-screen avatar, usually someone on the bottom of the screen, who could move and avoid enemy attacks while returning fire. These sorts of shooters almost always utilize horizontal scrolling to the right to indicate level progression, with enemies appearing in waves from predestined locations in the background or from the sides. One of the earliest examples is the 1985 arcade game &quot;Shootout&quot; produced by Data East.

As light gun games and rail shooters became more prevalent and started to make use of scrolling backgrounds, such as &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;, or fully 3D backgrounds, such as the &quot;Time Crisis&quot; or &quot;House of the Dead&quot; series, these sorts of games fell out of popular production, but many like &quot;Blood Bros.&quot; still have their fanbase today. Other notable games of this category include &quot;Cabal&quot; and &quot;Wild Guns&quot;.

=== Light gun shooter ===
Light gun shooters are shooters designed for use with a gun-shaped controller, typically a light gun in arcade games; similar control methods include a positional gun, motion controller, pointing device or analog stick. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, following the development of light-sensing vacuum tubes. It was not long before the technology began appearing in mechanical shooting arcade games, dating back to the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite in 1936. These early mechanical gun games evolved into shooting electro-mechanical games around the mid-20th century, and in turn evolved into light gun shooter video games in the 1970s.

Early mechanical light gun games used small targets (usually moving) onto which a light-sensing tube was mounted; the player used a gun (usually a rifle) that emitted a beam of light when the trigger was pulled. If the beam struck the target, a &quot;hit&quot; was scored. Modern screen-based video game light guns work on the opposite principle—the sensor is built into the gun itself, and the on-screen target(s) emit light rather than the gun. The first light gun of this type was used on the MIT Whirlwind computer, which used a similar light pen. Like rail shooters, movement is typically limited in light-gun games.

Notable games of this category include the 1974 and 1984 versions of &quot;Wild Gunman&quot;, &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; for the NES, &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;, &quot;Lethal Enforcers&quot;, the &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; series, &quot;Time Crisis&quot; series, &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; series, and &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot; &amp; &quot;Darkside Chronicles&quot;.

=== First-person shooter (FPS) (Doom clone) ===


First-person shooters are characterized by an on-screen representation of the player character&#x27;s perspective within a three-dimensional space, with the player having control and agency over the character&#x27;s movement and action within that space. While many rail shooters and light-gun shooters also use a first-person perspective, they are generally not included in this category, as the player generally lacks agency to move their character within the game world.

Notable examples of the genre include &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, &quot;Battlefield&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor&quot;, &quot;Unreal&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, &quot;Killzone&quot;, &quot;TimeSplitters&quot;, &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; and &quot;Halo&quot;, while games such as &quot;Half-Life&quot;, Deus Ex, and &quot;System Shock&quot; would combine shooter gameplay with narrative-focused or role-playing game elements to instead branch off into the immersive sim genre.

==== Boomer shooter ====
Boomer shooter is a term used to describe newer FPS games (2010s and later) that are purposely designed to emulate the style and design principles of 1990s FPS games like &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. The name &quot;boomer shooter&quot; is derived from the baby boomer generation, where &quot;boomer&quot; has since become slang for anything old or antiquated. According to New Blood Interactive CEO Dave Oshry, the term originated following the release of &quot;Dusk&quot; (2018), with fans of that game quickly coining the term. Newer triple-A games like &quot;&quot; (2014) and &quot;Doom&quot; (2016) helped to repopularize these styles of shooters in the mid-2010s, and indie developers further contributed to the field with games like &quot;Amid Evil&quot;, &quot;Ion Fury&quot;, and &quot;Ultrakill&quot;.

=== Third-person shooter (TPS) ===

Third-person shooters are characterized by a third-person camera view that fully displays the player character in their surroundings.

Notable examples of the genre include &quot;Fortnite&quot;, the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series, several entries in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; franchises, &quot;Syphon Filter&quot;, &quot;Max Payne&quot;, &quot;SOCOM&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot;, &quot;Gears of War&quot;, and &quot;Splatoon&quot;. Third person shooter mechanics are often incorporated into open-world adventure and sandbox games, including the &quot;Elder Scrolls&quot; series and the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; franchise.

=== FPS/TPS variations ===

==== Arena shooter ====
Arena shooters are multiplayer games that feature fast paced gameplay that emphasize quick speed and agile movement, and played out on levels or maps of limited size (the &quot;arena&quot;). Many of these are presented as first-person shooters, and thus &quot;arena FPS&quot; may also be used to describe a subset of these games. Examples of these include the &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Unreal&quot; series, more specifically &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; which first pioneered the genre. Arena shooters can also be played from other perspectives, such as via a top-down view in games like &quot;Robotron 2084&quot; and &quot;Geometry Wars&quot;. Arena shooters frequently emphasize multiplayer modes with few or no single-player modes outside of practice matches with computer-controlled opponents. The genre hit its peak in popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s.

==== Hero shooter ====
Hero shooters are a variation of multiplayer first- or third-person shooters, where players form into two or more teams and select from pre-designed &quot;hero&quot; characters, with each possessing distinctive abilities or weapons that are specific to them. Hero shooters strongly encourage teamwork between players on a team, guiding players to select effective combinations of hero characters and coordinate the use of hero abilities during a match. Outside of a match, players have the ability to customize the appearance of these characters, but these changes are usually cosmetic only and do not alter the game&#x27;s balance or the behavior of the &quot;hero&quot;. Hero shooters take many of their design elements from older class-based shooter, multiplayer online battle arena and fighting games. The class-based shooter &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; is considered to be the codifier of the hero shooter genre. Popular hero shooters include &quot;Overwatch&quot;, &quot;Paladins,&quot; &quot;Apex Legends&quot;, and &quot;Valorant&quot;. Hero shooters have been considered to have strong potential as esports games as a large degree of skill and coordination arises from the importance of teamwork.

==== Tactical shooter ====
Tactical shooters are shooters that generally simulate realistic squad-based or man-to-man skirmishes. Notable examples of the genre include Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; and &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; series and Bohemia Software&#x27;s &quot;Operation Flashpoint&quot;. A common feature of tactical shooters that is not present in many other shooters is the ability for the player character to lean out of cover, increasing the granularity of a player&#x27;s movement and stance options to enhance the realism of the game. Tactical shooters also commonly feature more extensive equipment management, more complex healing systems, and greater depth of simulation compared to other shooters. As a result of this, many tactical shooters are commonly played from the first person perspective. Tactical shooters may combine elements from other shooter genres, such as &quot;Rainbow Six Siege&quot;, &quot;Valorant&quot;, and Squad, which combine the traditional tactical shooter style with the class-based gameplay of hero shooters.
A further variant of the tactical shooter is the extraction shooter, generally defined by the gameplay style of &quot;Escape from Tarkov&quot;. These games are often &quot;player versus player versus environment&quot; (PvPvE), where players are grouped into teams and placed on a map with the goal to reach an extraction point elsewhere on the map while avoiding the opposing team and non-player character enemies. During their attempt to reach the extraction point, the players may try to loot the opposing team or other features on the map for gear, which if they successfully reach the extraction point, they can keep and use to improve their character. Alternatively, they may have other assigned objectives to complete before extraction for better rewards. Gameplay is more slow and tactical for survival rather than straightforward run-and-gun. Other examples of extraction shooters include &quot;The Cycle: Frontier&quot; and the upcoming revival of the &quot;Marathon&quot; series.

==== Looter shooter ====

Looter shooters are shooter games where the player&#x27;s overarching goal is the accumulation of loot: weapons, equipment, armor, accessories and resources. To achieve this players complete tasks framed as quests, missions or campaigns and are rewarded with better weapons, gear and accessories as a result, with the qualities, attributes and perks of such gear generated randomly following certain rarity scales (also known as loot tables). The better gear allows players to take on more difficult missions with potentially more powerful rewards, forming the game&#x27;s compulsion loop. Loot shooters are inspired by similar loot-based action role-playing games like &quot;Diablo&quot;. Examples of loot shooters include the &quot;Borderlands&quot; franchise, &quot;Warframe&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot; and its sequel, and &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division&quot; and its sequel.

=== Artillery game ===
Artillery games have been described as a type of &quot;shooting game&quot;, though they are more frequently classified as a type of strategy game.

=== Battle royale ===
Battle royale games are a subgenre of action games that combine last-man-standing gameplay with survival game elements, and frequently includes shooter elements. It is almost exclusively multiplayer in nature, and eschews the complex crafting and resource gathering mechanics of survival games for a faster-paced confrontation game more typical of shooters. The genre is named after the Japanese film &quot;Battle Royale&quot; (2000) which itself was based on the 1999 novel of the same name, and was popularized in video games with &quot;PUBG Battlegrounds&quot; and &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;.

==History==
The concept of shooting games existed before video games, dating back to shooting gallery carnival games in the late 19th century, as well as target sports such as shooting sports, bowling, cue sports, archery and darts. Mechanical gun games first appeared in England&#x27;s amusement arcades around the turn of the 20th century, before appearing in America by the 1920s. The British cinematic shooting gallery game &quot;Life Targets&quot; (1912) was a mechanical interactive film game where players shot at a cinema screen displaying film footage of targets. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, with the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite. Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and the rifle fired beams of light at targets wired with sensors.

Shooting gallery games eventually evolved into more sophisticated shooting electro-mechanical games (EM games) such as Sega&#x27;s influential &quot;Periscope&quot; (1965). Contemporary shooting video games have roots in older EM shooting games. Another influential Sega EM shooting game was &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1969), where two players control cowboy figurines on opposing sides of a playfield full of obstacles, with each player attempting to shoot the opponent&#x27;s cowboy. It had a Western theme and was one of the first games to feature competitive head-to-head shooting between two players, inspiring several early Western-themed shooter video games.

===1960s to mid-1970s===
&quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962), recognized as one of the first video games, was also the first shooter video game; it featured two players controlling spacecraft trying to fire onto the other player. &quot;Spacewar!&quot; was the basis for the first arcade video games, &quot;Computer Space&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Game&quot;, in 1971. In the 1970s, EM gun games evolved into light gun shooter video games. The first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, shipped with a light gun for a shooting gallery game in 1972. In 1974, &quot;Tank&quot; by Kee Games adapted the concept of &quot;Computer Space&quot; into a more grounded tank combat game with simplified physics and maze game elements, becoming a hit in arcades. &quot;Spasim&quot; and &quot;Maze War&quot; (1974) were effectively first-person shooter (FPS) games, but had wireframe graphics and lacked the free-roaming character movement of later FPS titles.

In 1975, Taito&#x27;s Tomohiro Nishikado adapted the concept of Sega&#x27;s EM game &quot;Gun Fight&quot; into a video game, &quot;Western Gun&quot; (1975), with the cowboys represented as character sprites and both players able to maneuver across a landscape while shooting each other, making it a milestone for depicting human shooting targets. &quot;Western Gun&quot; became an arcade hit, which, along with &quot;Tank&quot;, popularized a subgenre of one-on-one dueling video games. Midway&#x27;s North American localization of &quot;Western Gun&quot;, called &quot;Gun Fight&quot;, also introduced the use of a microprocessor. In 1976, Midway had another hit shooting video game, &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; (1976), which was adapted from another Sega EM game, &quot;Periscope&quot;.

===Late 1970s to 1980s===
The genre gained major attraction in popular culture with the release of Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; arcade video game in 1978. It established the basis of the shoot &#x27;em up subgenre, and became a cultural phenomenon that led into a golden age of arcade video games that lasted until around 1983. In contrast to earlier shooting games, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; has targets that fire back at the player, who in turn has multiple lives. Designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, who combined elements from his earlier &quot;Western Gun&quot; (such as destructible environmental objects) with elements of Atari&#x27;s &quot;Breakout&quot; (1976) and science fiction media, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; established a formula of &quot;shoot or be shot&quot; against numerous enemies. Space shooters subsequently became the dominant genre in arcades from the late 1970s up until the early 1980s. Most of these shooting games were presented from a 2D top-down-style perspective, with either a fixed or scrolling field. Games like &quot;Space Wars&quot; (1977) by Cinematronics and &quot;Tempest&quot; (1981) by Atari used vector graphics displays rather than raster graphics, while Sega&#x27;s &quot;Zaxxon&quot; (1981) was the first video game to use an isometric playfield.

In the early 1980s, Japanese arcade developers began moving away from space shooters towards character action games. On the other hand, American arcade developers continued to focus on space shooters during the early 1980s. According to Eugene Jarvis, American arcade developers were greatly influenced by Japanese space shooters but took the genre in a different direction from the &quot;more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type&quot; gameplay of Japanese games, towards a more &quot;programmer-centric design culture, emphasizing algorithmic generation of backgrounds and enemy dispatch&quot; and &quot;an emphasis on random-event generation, particle-effect explosions and physics&quot; as seen in arcade games such as his own &quot;Defender&quot; (1981) and &quot;&quot; (1982) as well as Atari&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979). Nevertheless, Japanese developers occasionally released defining space shooters in the early 1980s, such as Sega&#x27;s isometric shooter &quot;Zaxxon&quot; and pseudo-3D rail shooter &quot;Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom&quot; (1982) demonstrating the potential of 3D shoot &#x27;em up gameplay.

Shooter games diversified by the mid-1980s, with first-person light gun shooting gallery games such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; (1984), pseudo-3D third-person rail shooters such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Space Harrier&quot; (1985) and &quot;After Burner&quot; (1987), and military-themed scrolling run and gun video games such as Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), Konami&#x27;s &quot;Green Beret&quot; (1985) and SNK&#x27;s &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; (1986). In the late 1980s, Taito&#x27;s &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; (1987) popularized military-themed first-person light gun rail shooters.

===1990s to present===
&quot;Doom&quot; (1993) by id Software is considered the first major popular first-person shooter (FPS), and it was a major leap forward for three-dimensional environments in shooter games as well as action games in general. While first-person perspectives had been used by rail shooter and shooting gallery games, they lacked player-guided navigation through a three-dimensional space, a defining feature of FPS games.

The use of texture-mapped 3D polygon graphics in shooter games dates back to Sega AM2&#x27;s light gun rail shooter &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; (1994), followed by Sega&#x27;s mech simulation shooter &quot;Metal Head&quot; (1995) and Parallax Software&#x27;s FPS game &quot;Descent&quot; (1995). &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (1997) for the Nintendo 64 later combined the FPS sub-genre with light gun rail shooter elements from &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, popularizing FPS games on consoles. In the late 1990s, FPS games became increasingly popular while rail shooters declined in popularity, as FPS games were generally able to offer more variety, depth and sophistication than rail shooters. One of the last mainstream light gun rail shooter franchises was &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; horror game series in the late 1990s, which along with &quot;Resident Evil&quot; had a significant cultural impact on zombie media including zombie films by the 2000s.

== Controversy ==
Due to its violent nature, some consider the shooter game genre to be a representation of real world violence. Debates regarding video games causing violence were exacerbated by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, whose perpetrators, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, were fans of the game &quot;Doom.&quot; Similarly, in Germany, school shootings such as those at Erfurt, Emsdetten and Winnenden, resulted in conservative politicians accusing violent shooter games, most notably &quot;Counter Strike&quot;, of inciting young gamers to run amok. Several attempts were made to ban the &quot;Killerspiele&quot; (killing games) in Germany and the European Union. Shooter games were further criticized when Anders Behring Breivik, perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, claimed that he developed target acquisition skills by playing &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;. This has led to a plethora of experimental research to determine the true effects. Experimental Research, focusing on the short term effects, found that playing violent games can increase the player&#x27;s aggression. In a 2011 Supreme Court case involving a California law, Justice Antonio Scalia stated that there was some correlation between violent video games and increased aggression, but very little real-world effects. An experiment by C.A. Anderson and K.E. Dill, in which they had undergraduates randomly play either a violent or non-violent game, determined that the students who played the violent game were more susceptible to primed aggressive thoughts. Further studies have shown that there are some limitations with the research. Many research studies have not taken into account that violent video games tend to be more competitive, have a higher playing difficulty, and are more fast paced than non-violent games. Past research also shows that the way aggression was measured in the studies could be compared to the way competitiveness is measured, leaving open the question of whether or not the effects of violent video games are forms of aggression or competitiveness.

<text>A specificity factor is an amino acid sequence that mediates target recognition in RNA polymerase. An example is the sigma subunit of the &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; RNA polymerase holoenzyme which regulates a binding σ subunit of molecular weight 70 kDa. Under some conditions, some of the 70-kDa subunits are replaced by one of the other, more-specific factors. For instance, when bacteria are subjected to heat stress, some of the 70-kDa subunits are replaced by a 32-kDa subunit; when bound to σ32, RNA polymerase is directed to a specialized set of promoters with a different consensus sequence.

<text>Grantray-Lawrence Animation was an animation studio active from 1954 to 1968 and founded by Grant Simmons, Ray Patterson (hence &quot;Grant-Ray&quot;), and Robert L. Lawrence.

This animation company produced commercials and low-budget animated television shows until it went bankrupt in 1968 and its distributor, Krantz Films, took over production. The best-known of those animated shows are its adaptations of superheroes from Marvel Comics, the earliest such adaptations for electronic media. Before then, it did sub-contracted work on &quot;Top Cat&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;The Dick Tracy Show&quot;, and &quot;The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo&quot;.

<doc id="619311" wikidata="Q354728" url="?curid=619311" title="Roy Porter">
<text>Roy Sydney Porter (31 December 1946 – 3 March 2002) was a British historian known for his work on the history of medicine. He retired in 2001 as the director of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine at University College London (UCL).

==Life==

Porter grew up in South London and attended Wilson&#x27;s School in Camberwell. He won a scholarship to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied under J. H. Plumb. His contemporaries included Simon Schama and Andrew Wheatcroft. He achieved a double starred first and became a junior Fellow in 1968, studying under Robert M. Young and lecturing on the British Enlightenment. In 1972, he moved to Churchill College as the Director of Studies in History, later becoming Dean in 1977. He received his doctorate in 1974, publishing a thesis on the history of geology as a scientific discipline. He was then appointed to the post of Assistant Lecturer in European History at Cambridge University and promoted to Lecturer in European History in 1977.

In 1979 he joined the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine (part of University College London) as a lecturer. In 1993 he became Professor of Social History at the institute. He briefly served as its director. In 2000, Porter published &quot;The Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World&quot;. He retired in September 2001, moving to St Leonards-on-Sea, where he wanted to learn to play the saxophone, cultivate his allotment and engage in some travelling. He died of a heart attack five months later, while cycling. His memorial service was on 22 April 2002 at St Pancras Parish Church.

He was married five times, firstly to Sue Limb (1970), then Jacqueline Rainfray (1983), then Dorothy Watkins (1987), then Hannah Augstein, and finally his wife at the time of his death, Natsu Hattori.

He was known for the fact that he needed very little sleep.

Roy Porter gave an annual history lecture to the boys at Wilson&#x27;s School, Wallington.

==Media appearances==
Porter made many television and radio appearances. He was an original presenter of BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Night Waves&quot;, a programme on which he was scheduled to appear, discussing doctors in literature, at the point of his death.

He also spoke at a large variety of events, and was known for his oratorical talents.

==Honours==
He was awarded the Leo Gershoy Award of the American Historical Association in 1988.

Porter was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1994, and was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

A plaque for the memory of Porter was unveiled by the Mayor of Lewisham in a ceremony that took place on Thursday 5 June 2008 at 13 Camplin Street, New Cross Gate, London.

==Works==
Starting with the publishing of his PhD thesis, as &quot;The Making of Geology&quot; in 1977, Porter wrote or edited over 100 books, an academic output that was, and is, considered remarkable. The poet Michael Hofmann called him &quot;a one-man book factory.&quot; He is particularly notable for his work in the history of medicine, in pioneering an approach that focuses on patients rather than doctors. Despite his recognition in the history of medicine, he is quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not really a medical historian. I&#x27;m a social historian and an 18th century man&quot;. In addition to the history of medicine and other sciences, he specialised in the social history of 18th-century Britain and the Enlightenment. He also wrote and lectured on the history of London. With G. E. Berrios, Porter published &quot;A History of Clinical Psychiatry&quot; (1985) and co-edited the international journal &quot;History of Psychiatry&quot; (1989). He also edited the journal &quot;History of Science&quot; for many years.

In 2007 Roberta Bivins and John V. Pickstone edited &quot;Medicine, Madness and Social History: Essays in Honour of Roy Porter&quot; (Palgrave Macmillan). Several of the essays address Porter&#x27;s work directly, and William F. Bynum appends a biographical sketch.

<text>Lezgian, also called Lezgi or Lezgin , is a Northeast Caucasian language. It is spoken by the Lezgins, who live in southern Dagestan (Russia); northern Azerbaijan; and to a much lesser degree Turkmenistan; Uzbekistan; Kazakhstan; Turkey, and other countries. It is a much-written literary language and an official language of Dagestan. It is classified as &quot;vulnerable&quot; by UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot;. 

== Geographic distribution ==
In 2002, Lezgian was spoken by about 397,000 people in Russia, mainly Southern Dagestan; in 1999 it was spoken by 178,400 people in mainly the Qusar, Quba, Qabala, Oghuz, Ismailli and Khachmaz provinces of northeastern Azerbaijan. Lezgian is also spoken in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Germany and Uzbekistan by immigrants from Azerbaijan and Dagestan.

Some speakers are in the Balikesir, Yalova, İzmir, Bursa regions of Turkey especially in Kirne (Ortaca), a village in Balikesir Province which touches the western coast, being south-west of Istanbul.

The total number of speakers is about 800,000.

== Classification ==

Nine languages survive in the Lezgic language family:
* Lezgin
* Tabasaran
* Rutul
* Aghul
* Tsakhur

==Phonology==

===Vowels===


* has two main allophones: and ; the former prevails in closed syllables (especially before uvulars and ), the latter in open syllables.
* is very often rounded and raised to after labialized consonants, which may then lose their labialization. For example, becomes or .
* is more open in stressed syllables and or in pre-stress syllables. In the environment of labialized consonants /e/ is often pronounced as ~.
* if a vowel plus sequence is not followed by a vowel, the may be deleted and the vowel nasalized. Thus can be pronounced .
* Chitoran and Babaliyeva show, at least for Babaliyeva in her native Yargun dialect, pre-tonic high vowels are syncopated.

===Consonants===
There are 54 consonants in Lezgian. Characters to the right are the letters of the Lezgian Cyrillic Alphabet. Aspiration is not normally indicated in the orthography, despite the fact that it is phonemic.
== Alphabets ==

Lezgian has been written in several different alphabets over the course of its history. These alphabets have been based on three scripts: Arabic (before 1928), Latin (1928–38), and Cyrillic (1938–present).

The Lezgian Cyrillic alphabet is as follows:

The Latin alphabet was as follows:

==Grammar==
Lezgian is unusual for a Northeast Caucasian language in not having noun classes (also called &quot;grammatical gender&quot;). Standard Lezgian grammar features 18 grammatical cases, produced by agglutinating suffixes, of which 12 are still used in spoken conversation.

===Cases===
The four grammatical cases are:
* Absolutive case (basic form of the word, no ending): marks the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive sentence. It is also used to mark a nominal predicate (who or what something turns into/becomes) and as a vocative.
* Ergative case (various endings; the most common are: -ди, -a or -е; [-di, -a or e], which are added to the Absolutive): marks the subject of transitive verbs, and the subject of some compound intransitive verbs.
* Genitive case (ending -н [-n]; added to the Ergative): marks possession. It is also used with the meaning &#x27;of&#x27;. The genitive case precedes the noun that it modifies.
* Dative case (ending -з [-z]; added to the Ergative): usually marks the indirect object of sentences, that is the recipient of an action. It is also used to mark the subject of some verbs (mainly about emotions) and to express a point of time and direction.
* There are fourteen Locative cases:
** Adessive case (ending -в [-v]; added to the Ergative): marks the object of some verbs to mean &#x27;by&#x27;, &#x27;to&#x27;, &#x27;with&#x27;.
** Adelative case (ending -вай [-vaj]; added to the Ergative): expresses movement from somewhere. It is also used with the verb &#x27;to be able&#x27; and to express an accidental action.
** Addirective case (ending -вди [-vdi]; added to the Ergative): used as an instrumental case, but also sometimes used with its original meaning, &#x27;in the direction of&#x27;, and more rarely &#x27;near by&#x27;.
** The Postessive case (ending -хъ [-qh]; added to the Ergative): means &#x27;behind&#x27;, &#x27;at&#x27;, &#x27;toward&#x27;, &#x27;in exchange for&#x27;, and &#x27;with.&#x27; In a construction with the verb ава (ava), it expresses possession.
** Postelative case (ending -хъай [-qhaj]; added to the Ergative): can either mean &#x27;from&#x27; or the cause of fear or shame.
** Postdirective case (ending -хъди [-qhdi]; added to the Ergative): rarely used case, meaning &#x27;toward(s)&#x27;.
** Subessive case (ending -к [-k]; added to the Ergative): means either &#x27;below&#x27; or &#x27;participates&#x27;.
** Subelative case (ending -кай [-kaj]; added to the Ergative): means either &#x27;from below&#x27;, &#x27;from&#x27;, &#x27;(from) against&#x27;, &#x27;with&#x27; or &#x27;out of&#x27; (partitive). It is also used to mark Y in the construction &#x27;X becomes out-of-Y&#x27; and can express the topic of a sentence (&#x27;about&#x27;) or the cause of emotions.
** Subdirective case (ending -кди [-kdi]; added to the Ergative): expresses cause (never motion under), and can mean &#x27;because&#x27; or &#x27;of&#x27; (when in sentences such as &#x27;the man died &quot;of&quot; a disease&#x27;.
** Inessive case (endings -а or -е [-a or -e]; added to Absolutive): means &#x27;at&#x27;, &#x27;in&#x27; or &#x27;during/whilst&#x27;.
** Inelative case (endings -ай or -ей [-aj or -ej]; added to Inessive): means &#x27;out of&#x27; or &#x27;in return for&#x27;.
** Superessive case (ending -л [-l]; added to the Inessive): means &#x27;on&#x27;, and also to express the cause of some emotions.
** Superelative case (ending -лай [-laj]; added to the Inessive): means &#x27;off&#x27;, &#x27;after&#x27; or &#x27;than&#x27; (comparison).
** Superdirective case (ending -лди [-ldi]; added to the Inessive): means &#x27;onto&#x27;, &#x27;until&#x27;, &#x27;in&#x27; (when followed by an adjective), as an instrumental case (e.g. language) or instructive with abstract nouns.

===Declension===
There are two types of declensions.

====First declension====
==Vocabulary==

===Numbers===
The numbers of Lezgian are:

Nouns following a number are always in the singular. Numbers precede the noun. &quot;Сад&quot; and &quot;кьвед&quot; lose their final &quot;-д&quot; before a noun.

Lezgian numerals work in a similar fashion to the French ones, and are based on the vigesimal system in which &quot;20&quot;, not &quot;10&quot;, is the base number. &quot;Twenty&quot; in Lezgian is &quot;къад&quot;, and higher numbers are formed by adding the suffix -ни to the word (which becomes &quot;къанни&quot; - the same change occurs in пудкъад and кьудкъад) and putting the remaining number afterwards. This way 24 for instance is къанни кьуд (&quot;20 and 4&quot;), and 37 is къанни цӏерид (&quot;20 and 17&quot;). Numbers over 40 are formed similarly (яхцӏур becomes яхцӏурни). 60 and 80 are treated likewise. For numbers over 100 just put a number of hundreds, then (if need be) the word with a suffix, then the remaining number. 659 is thus ругуд вишни яхцӏурни цӏекӏуьд. The same procedure follows for 1000. 1989 is агьзурни кӏуьд вишни кьудкъанни кӏуьд in Lezgi.

<text>Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve is a national park of the United States that protects portions of the Brooks Range in northern Alaska. The park is the northernmost national park in the United States, situated entirely north of the Arctic Circle. The area of the park and preserve is the second largest in the U.S. at ; the National Park portion is the second largest in the U.S., after the National Park portion of Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve.

Gates of the Arctic was initially designated as a national monument on December 1, 1978, before being redesignated as a national park and preserve upon passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980. About 85% of the park has additional protection as the Gates of the Arctic Wilderness which covers . The wilderness area adjoins the Noatak Wilderness. Together, they form the largest contiguous wilderness in the United States.

==Park purpose==
According to the National Park website:
==Activities==

There are no roads or official trails in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Owing to its remoteness and lack of supportive infrastructure, the park is the least visited national park in the U.S., and one of the least visited areas in the entire U.S. National Park System, which also includes national monuments, recreation areas, preserves, and historic sites. In 2021, the park received just 7,362 recreation visitors, while Grand Canyon National Park received about 4.5 million visitors (over 600 times as many) in the same year.

Camping is permitted throughout the park, but may be restricted by easements when crossing Native Corporation lands within the park.

The park headquarters is in Fairbanks. Park Service operations in the park are managed from the Bettles Ranger Station, to the south of the park.

==Geography==

Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve lies to the west of the Dalton Highway, centered on the Brooks Range and covering the north and south slopes of the mountains. The park includes the Endicott Mountains and part of the Schwatka Mountains. The majority of Gates of the Arctic is designated as national park, in which only subsistence hunting by local rural residents is permitted. Sport hunting is only permitted in the national preserve. To hunt and trap in the preserve, a person must have all required licenses and permits and follow all other state regulations.

The eastern boundary of the park generally follows the Dalton Highway at a distance of a few miles, with the westernmost part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge farther east. Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge is near the park&#x27;s southeast boundary. Noatak National Preserve adjoins the western boundary, and the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska adjoins the northwest corner of the park. Almost all of the park is designated as wilderness, with the exception of areas around Anaktuvuk Pass. A detached portion of the park surrounds the outlying Fortress Mountain and Castle Mountain to the north of the park.

Ten small communities outside the park&#x27;s boundaries are classified as &quot;resident zone communities&quot; and depend on park resources for food and livelihood. They are Alatna, Allakaket, Ambler, Anaktuvuk Pass, Bettles, Evansville, Hughes, Kobuk, Nuiqsut, Shungnak, and Wiseman. There are no established roads, trails, visitor facilities, or campgrounds in the park. The Dalton Highway (Alaska State Highway 11) comes within five miles (8 km) of the park&#x27;s eastern boundary, but requires a river crossing to reach the park from the road. The Arctic Interagency Visitor Center in nearby Coldfoot is open from late May to early September, providing information on the parks, preserves and refuges of the Brooks Range, Yukon Valley and the North Slope. About of the park and preserve are owned by native corporations or the State of Alaska. are protected in the Gates of the Arctic Wilderness, the third-largest designated wilderness area in the United States (after the Wrangell-Saint Elias Wilderness and the Mollie Beattie Wilderness, both also in Alaska).

The park contains mountains such as the Arrigetch Peaks and Mount Igikpak. The park also features six Wild and Scenic Rivers:
*Alatna River 
*John River 
*Kobuk River 
*the North Fork of the Koyukuk River 
*part of the Noatak River
*Tinayguk River 

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve has a Subarctic with Cool Summers and Year Around Rainfall Climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;). The plant hardiness zone at Anaktuvuk Pass Ranger Station is 2b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of . Perennial snowfields and glaciers, which are crucial to various ecosystems within the park, are decreasing at a rapid rate due to warming temperatures. From 1985 to 2017, the area of these snowfields decreased in size by 13 km2. These warming temperatures have also resulted in the thawing of permafrost which has directly affected the stability of the soil. As permafrost thaws, it exposes the bare soil to the elements which leads to erosion and slope failures.

==Geology==

The park includes much of the central and eastern Brooks Range. It extends to the east as far as the Middle Fork of the Koyukuk River, which is paralleled by the Dalton Highway and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The park straddles the continental divide, separating the drainages of the Pacific and Arctic Oceans. The northernmost section of the park includes small portions of the Arctic foothills tundra. The Brooks Range occupies the central section of the park, running on an east-west line. To the south of the Brooks Range the Ambler-Chandalar Ridge runs east-west. Between the mountains are many remote glacier-carved valleys, dotted with alpine lakes.

The southernmost portion of the park includes the Kobuk-Selawik Lowlands, with the headwaters of the Kobuk River. The Brooks Range has seen repeated glaciation, with the most recent called the Itkillik glaciation from about 24,000 years ago to roughly 1500 to 1200 years before the present.

==Ecology==

The boreal forest extends to about 68 degrees north latitude, characterized by black and white spruce mixed with poplar. To the north of that line, which coincides with the spine of the Brooks Range, lies cold-arid land that has been described as &quot;Arctic desert.&quot; During the long winters temperatures can reach , but can reach for a short time in summer. The park lies above the Arctic Circle.

Fauna include brown bears, black bears, muskoxen, moose, Dall sheep, timber wolves, wolverines, coyotes, lynxes, Arctic ground squirrels, lemmings, voles, marmots, porcupines, river otters, red and Arctic fox species, beavers, wood frogs, snowshoe hares, collared pikas, muskrats, Arctic terns, bald eagles, golden eagles, peregrine falcons, ospreys, great horned and northern hawk-owls. The rivers contain a variety of fish species, including the grayling, Arctic char and chum salmon. Eagles and other birds of prey can be seen soaring overhead waiting for unsuspecting prey.

More than half a million caribou, including the Central Arctic, Western Arctic, Teshekpuk, and Porcupine herds, migrate through the central Brooks Range twice yearly, traveling north in summer, and south in winter. Caribou are important as a food source to native peoples. However, the decreasing size of perennial snowfields within the park may decrease the size of this caribou population. The park is the northernmost range limit for the Dall sheep. About 132 brown bears reside in the park and preserve, based on a density of about one bear per .

==History==

Nomadic peoples have inhabited the Brooks Range for as many as 12,500 years, living mainly on caribou and other wildlife. The Mesa site at Iteriak Creek has yielded evidence of occupation between 11,500 and 10,300 years before the present. Later sites from around 6,000 years before present have yielded projectile points, stone knives and net sinkers. The Arctic small tool tradition (ASTt) of about 4,500 BP has also been documented. A late phase of the ASTt from between 2500 and 950 BP, the Ipuitak phase, has been documented in the park at the Bateman Site at Itkillik Lake.

The earliest Inupiat people appeared about 1200 AD at the coast and spread to the Brooks Range, becoming the Nunamiut. The Nunamiut people, who had left much of their traditional homelands following a crash in the caribou populations in the early 1900s, resumed a relatively isolated subsistence way of life after returning to the mountains in the late 1930s. In 1949 the last two semi-nomadic bands came together in the valley of the Anaktuvuk River, and over the next decade established the community of Anaktuvuk Pass. The Gwich&#x27;in people, a Northern Athabaskan group also lived in the area in the last 1000 years, moving south of the park in historic times.

The Alaskan interior was not explored until the late 19th century, shortly before discovery of gold in the Klondike brought prospectors to Alaska. Some encampments of explorers and survey parties have been identified in the park. A few small mining operations were established in the early 20th century, never amounting to much.

The park&#x27;s name dates to 1929, when wilderness activist Bob Marshall, exploring the North Fork of the Koyukuk River, encountered a pair of mountains (Frigid Crags and Boreal Mountain), one on each side of the river. He christened this portal the &quot;Gates of the Arctic.&quot; Marshall spent time in Wiseman during the early 1930s, publishing an account of the place in his 1933 book &quot;Arctic Village&quot;. In the 1940s writer and researcher Olaus Murie proposed that Alaskan lands be preserved.

Proposals for a national park in the Brooks Range first emerged in the 1960s, and in 1968 a National Park Service survey team recommended the establishment of a park in the area. That year, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall recommended to President Lyndon B. Johnson that Johnson use the Antiquities Act to proclaim a national monument in the Brooks Range and other Alaskan locations, but Johnson declined. During the 1970s the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) prompted serious examination of the disposition of lands held by the federal government. A series of bills were considered to deal with conservation land proposals authorized under ANCSA, but the legislation that would become the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) was held up in Congress in the late 1970s. Consequently, on December 1, 1978 President Jimmy Carter used the Antiquities Act to proclaim much of the proposed new Alaskan parklands as national monuments, including Gates of the Arctic National Monument. In 1980 Congress passed ANILCA, and the monument became Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve on December 2, 1980.

<text>Fringe theatre is theatre that is produced outside of the main theatre institutions, and that is often small-scale and non-traditional in style or subject matter. The term comes from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In London, the fringe are small-scale theatres, many of them located above pubs, and the equivalent to New York&#x27;s Off-Off-Broadway theatres and Europe&#x27;s &quot;free theatre&quot; groups.

In unjuried theatre festivals, also known as fringe festivals or open-access festivals, all submissions are accepted, and sometimes the participating acts may be chosen by lottery, in contrast to juried festivals in which acts are selected based on their artistic qualities. Unjuried festivals (such as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Edmonton Fringe Festival, Adelaide Fringe, and Fringe World) permit artists to perform a wide variety of works.

==History==
In 1947, eight theatre companies showed up at the Edinburgh International Festival, hoping to gain recognition from the mass gathering at the festival. In 1948, Robert Kemp, a Scottish journalist and playwright, described the situation, &quot;Round the fringe of official Festival drama, there seems to be more private enterprise than before ... I am afraid some of us are not going to be at home during the evenings!&quot;. Edinburgh Festival Fringe was founded under the name &quot;Festival Adjuncts&quot;, in 1947.

The fringe movement in Britain has been said to start in the 1960s, similar to the United States&#x27; Off-Off-Broadway theatres and Europe&#x27;s &quot;free theatre&quot; groups. The term came into use in the late 1950s, and the show &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; premiered in Edinburgh in 1960, before transferring to Broadway and is the West End. One of the early innovators in fringe theatre was an American bookseller, James Haynes, who in 1963 created the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh. Also noted in this period is the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, Jerzy Grotowski&#x27;s Theatre of 13 Rows, and Józef Szajna&#x27;s Studio Theatre in Warsaw.

The Adelaide Fringe in Adelaide, South Australia, now second-largest annual arts festival in the world (after Edinburgh Fringe), started in 1960 as an adjunct to the main Adelaide Festival of Arts.

Haynes, while at the helm of the Traverse, was receiving state support and even got a new theatre in 1969. In 1969, Haynes created the Arts Lab in London, but it only lasted for two years. Peter Brook along with another American Charles Marowitz opened the Open Space Theatre on Tottenham Court Road in London in 1968. Young British writers, after the May 1968 events in France, wrote agitprop plays, including David Hare, Howard Brenton, David Edgar.

Meanwhile, in the United States, experimental theatre was growing due to the political protest of the Vietnam War. The Living Theatre, founded by Julian Beck, is considered the leader of the &quot;flower power&quot; and &quot;hippie&quot; movement.

By the early 1970s, many fringe theatres began to receive small subsidies. After the 1973–74 stock market crash, many fringe companies were forced to close. New playwrights were established at the Bush Theatre and King&#x27;s Head Theatre, both of whom survived the crash. 7:84 and Red Ladder Theatre Company were some of the surviving touring fringe groups.

Fringe theatres were attractive to people in the 1960s due to their adventurousness but became less wild in the 1970s while the standards of production rose.

In 1982, the first fringe festival in North America was started in Edmonton, Alberta. It was then a theatre component of the larger Summerfest but evolved to become a stand-alone event, the Edmonton International Fringe Festival, one of the largest annual arts events in Canada and still the largest fringe in North America by attendance. The oldest fringe festival in the United States is Orlando, FL, founded in 1992. There are more fringe festivals in North America than any other continent.

==Festival organization==
One distinction between fringe festivals and conventional arts festivals is the method used to choose participants. Typically, conventional festivals use a jury selection process, whereas many fringe festivals do not use a jury process in their selection criteria, hence the descriptor unjuried or open-access. There are exceptions to this; some fringe festivals (e.g., New York International Fringe Festival) do employ a jury-based selection process.

All performers are welcome to apply, regardless of their professional or amateur status. No restrictions are made as to the nature, style or theme of the performance, though some festivals have children&#x27;s areas with appropriate content limitations. Festivals may have too many applicants for the number of available spaces; in this case, applicants are chosen based on an unrelated criterion, such as order of application or a random draw.

The number of performances varies among different fringe festivals. Larger festivals may have thousands of performances (e.g., Edinburgh&#x27;s 2013 festival had 45,464 performances).

Fringe festivals typically have a common organising group that handles ticketing, scheduling, and some overall promotion (such as a program including all performers). Each production pays a set fee to this group, which usually includes their stage time as well as the organizational elements. The organising group and/or the venues often rely on a large pool of volunteers.

Ticket pricing varies between festivals. At UK fringe festivals, groups can decide their own ticket prices, and some sell tickets at fixed rates in one or two tiers, or in groups of 5 or 10.

Although it is unusual for the organising group to choose any winners of the festival, other organisations often make their own judgements of festival entries
. Productions can be reviewed by newspapers or publications specific to the festival, and awards may be given by certain organisations. Awards or favourable reviews can increase the tickets sales of productions or lead to extra dates being added .

==Elements of a typical production==
The limitations and opportunities that the fringe festival format presents lead to some common features.

Shows are not judged or juried. Depending on the popularity, some fringe festivals may use a lottery system to determine which shows are selected.

Shows are typically technically sparse. They are commonly presented in shared venues, often with shared technicians and limited technical time, so sets and other technical theatre elements are kept simple. Venues may be adapted from other uses.

Casts tend to be smaller than mainstream theatre; since many of the performing groups are traveling, and venues (and thus potential income) tend to be fairly small, expenses must usually be kept to a minimum. One-person shows are therefore quite common at fringe festivals. 

Fringe festival productions often showcase new scripts, especially ones on more obscure, edgy, or unusual material. The lack of artistic vetting combined with relatively easy entry make risk-taking more feasible.

While most mainstream theatre shows are two or three acts long, taking two to three hours with intermissions, fringe shows tend to be closer to one-hour, single-act productions. The typically lowered ticket prices of a fringe theatre show permit audiences to attend multiple shows in a single evening.

Performers sometimes billet in the homes of local residents, further reducing their costs.

<text>Nkroful is a village and the capital of the Ellembelle District in the Western Region of Ghana, located near Axim in the Nzema East Municipal. The village is the birthplace of Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana&#x27;s first president.

== History ==
The village of Nkroful was once under the Western Nzema Kingdom, which dates back to 1470. It is now under the Eastern Nzema Traditional Area. Kwesie Kutuah was the first known chief of the village in 1911.

As of 2023, the family head of Nkroful is Abusuapanyinli Senza Erzah and the Chief of Nkroful is Nana Kwasi Kutuah V.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Nkroful stands inland 5 km (3 miles) from the coastal highway, from the Essiama town junction turnoff.

=== Climate ===
The village lies in the semi-equatorial climatic zone of West Africa. It experiences all-year round rainfall with the high amounts occurring between May and June.

== Education ==
The village only have one senior high school, Nkroful Agricultural Senior High School, which was established in 1972.

== Nkrumah Mausoleum ==
Initially being buried in Guinea, Nkrumah was buried in Nkroful on 9 July 1972 at the original Nkrumah Mausoleum and monument. His remains were later lay to rest at the Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum in Accra in 1992.

<doc id="619319" wikidata="Q1746539" url="?curid=619319" title="Minor tractate">
<text>The minor tractates (, &quot;masechtot qetanot&quot;) are essays from the Talmudic period or later dealing with topics about which no formal tractate exists in the Mishnah. They may thus be contrasted to the Tosefta, whose tractates parallel those of the Mishnah.

Each minor tractate contains all the important material bearing on a single subject. While they are mishnaic in form and are called &quot;tractates,&quot; the topics discussed in them are arranged more systematically than in the Mishnah; for they are eminently practical in purpose, being, in a certain sense, the first manuals in which the data scattered through prolix sources have been collected in a brief and comprehensive form.

There are about 15 minor tractates. The first eight or so contain much original material; the last seven or so are collections of material scattered throughout the Talmud. Ancient authorities mention especially seven such tractates, which are doubtless the earliest ones. Their name and form suggests that they originated in the period of oral tradition which was dominated by the Talmud and the Midrash, so that these treatises are doubtless of great antiquity, some of them having been compiled in their main outlines before even the final redaction of the Talmud in the 6th century.

==List==
The minor tractates are normally printed at the end of &quot;Seder Nezikin&quot; in the Talmud. They include:
# Avot of Rabbi Natan (Hebrew: אבות דרבי נתן), an expansion of Pirkei Avot.
# Soferim (Hebrew: סופרים – Scribes). This tractate appears in two different versions in the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds.
# Evel Rabbati (Hebrew: אבל רבתי – Elaboration on Mourning). Contains laws and customs pertaining to death and mourning, and is sometimes euphemistically called &quot;Semakhot&quot; (&quot;joys&quot;).
# Kallah (Hebrew: כלה – Bride). On engagement, marriage and co-habitation.
# Kallah Rabbati (Hebrew: כלה רבתי – Great Bride). An elaboration of the previous.
# Derekh Eretz Rabbah (Hebrew: דרך ארץ רבה) &quot;Derekh Eretz&quot; literally means &quot;the way of the world,&quot; which in this context refers to deportment, manners and behavior.
# Derekh Eretz Zuta (Hebrew: דרך ארץ זוטא) Addressed to scholars, this is a collection of maxims urging self-examination and modesty.
# Perek ha-Shalom (Hebrew: פרק השלום – Chapter of Peace). On the ways of peace between people. It is a final chapter to Derekh Eretz Zuta, often listed separately.
# Sefer Torah (regulations for writing Torah scrolls). Nearly equivalent to the first five chapters of Soferim.
# Mezuzah (Hebrew: מזוזה – scroll affixed to the doorpost).
# Tefillin (Hebrew: תפילין – phylacteries).
# Tzitzit (Hebrew: ציצית – fringes).
# Avadim (Hebrew: עבדים – slaves).
# Gerim (Hebrew: גרים – converts).
# Kutim (Hebrew: כותים – Samaritans).

There is also a lost tractate called &quot;Eretz Yisrael&quot; (about laws pertaining to the Land of Israel). Similarly, a &quot;Masechet Hanukkah&quot; is mentioned in connection with the Vilna Gaon, but is not extant.

A translation of all of the minor tractates was published in two volumes by Soncino Press; a one-volume edition with the original Hebrew was later issued as part of their set of the Babylonian Talmud. Numerous translations of individual tractates have been produced by other publishers. The Yale Judaica Series includes translations of Avot de-Rabbi Natan and Semahot; the former has been translated at least three other times, and the latter also appears, along with the two Derekh Eretz tractates, in Michael Rodkinson&#x27;s Talmud translation.

<doc id="619320" wikidata="Q700919" url="?curid=619320" title="Chemical ecology">
<text>Chemical ecology is a vast and interdisciplinary field utilizing biochemistry, biology, ecology, and organic chemistry for explaining observed interactions of living things and their environment through chemical compounds (e.g. ecosystem resilience and biodiversity). Early examples of the field trace back to experiments with the same plant genus in different environments, interaction of plants and butterflies, and the behavioral effect of catnip. Chemical ecologists seek to identify the specific molecules (i.e. semiochemicals) that function as signals mediating community or ecosystem processes and to understand the evolution of these signals. The chemicals behind such roles are typically small, readily-diffusible organic molecules that act over various distances that are dependent on the environment (i.e. terrestrial or aquatic) but can also include larger molecules and small peptides.

In practice, chemical ecology relies on chromatographic techniques, such as thin-layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry (MS), and absolute configuration utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to isolate and identify bioactive metabolites. To identify molecules with the sought-after activity, chemical ecologists often make use of bioassay-guided fractionation. Today, chemical ecologists also incorporate genetic and genomic techniques to understand the biosynthetic and signal transduction pathways underlying chemically mediated interactions.

== Plant, microbe and insect chemical ecology ==

Plant, microbe, and insect chemical ecology focuses on the role of chemical cues and signals in mediating interactions with their abiotic (e.g. ability of some bacterium to reduce metals in the surrounding environment) and biotic environment (e.g. microorganisms, phytophagous insects, and pollinators). Cues allow for organisms to monitor interactions with the environment and to adjust accordingly through changes in chemical abundance as a response. Changes in compound abundance allows for defensive measures to be enacted, e.g. attracts for predators.

=== Plant-insect interactions ===

The chemical ecology of plant-insect interaction is a significant subfield of chemical ecology. In particular, plants and insects are often involved in a chemical evolutionary arms race. As plants develop chemical defenses to herbivory, insects which feed on them co-evolved to develop immunity to these poisons, and in some cases, repurpose these poisons for their own chemical defense against predators. For example, caterpillars of the monarch butterfly sequester cardenolide toxins from their milkweed host-plants and are able to use them as an anti-predator defense due to the toxin. Sequestering is a strategy of the co-evolution, feeding experiments on caterpillars of the monarch butterfly showed caterpillars which have not feed on milkweed do not pose similar toxins as those found to feed on milkweed. Whereas most insects are killed by cardenolides, which are potent inhibitors of the Na+/K+-ATPase, monarchs have evolved resistance to the toxin over their long evolutionary history with milkweeds. Other examples of sequestration include the tobacco hornworm &quot;Manduca sexta&quot;, which use nicotine sequestered from tobacco plants in predator defense; and the bella moth, which secretes a quinone-containing froth to deter predators obtained from feeding on &quot;Crotalaria&quot; plants as a caterpillar.

Chemical ecologists also study chemical interactions involved in indirect defenses of plants, such as the attraction of predators and parasitoids through herbivore-induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

=== Plant-microbe interactions ===

Plant interactions with microorganisms are also mediated by chemistry. Both constitutive and induced secondary metabolites (specialized metabolites in modern terminology) are involved in plant defense against pathogens and chemical signals are also important in the establishment and maintenance of resource mutualisms. For example, both rhizobia and mycorrhizae depend on chemical signals, such as strigolactones and flavanoids exuded from plant roots, in order to find a suitable host.

For microbes to gain access to the plant, they must be able to penetrate the layer of wax that forms a hydrophobic barrier on the plant&#x27;s surface. Many plant-pathogenic microbes secrete enzymes that break down these cuticular waxes. Mutualistic microbes on the other hand may be granted access. For example, rhizobia secrete Nod factors that trigger the formation of an infection thread in receptive plants. The rhizobial symbionts can then travel through this infection thread to gain entrance to root cells.

Mycorrhizae and other fungal endophytes may also benefit their host plants by producing antibiotics or other secondary metabolites/ specialized metabolites that ward off harmful fungi, bacteria and herbivores in the soil. Some entomopathogenic fungi can also form endophytic relationships with plants and may even transfer nitrogen directly to plants from insects they consume in the surrounding soil.

=== Plant-plant interactions ===
==== Allelopathy ====

Allelopathy is a sub-field of chemical ecology which focuses on secondary/ specialized metabolites (known as allelochemicals) produced by plants or microorganisms that can inhibit the growth and formation of neighboring plants or microorganisms within the natural community. Many examples of allelopathic competition have been controversial due to the difficulty of positively demonstrating a causal link between allelopathic substances and plant performance under natural conditions, but it is widely accepted that phytochemicals are involved in competitive interactions between plants. One of the clearest examples of allelopathy is the production of juglone by walnut trees, whose strong competitive effects on neighboring plants were recognized in the ancient world as early as 36 BC. Allelopathic compounds have also become an interest in agriculture as an alternative to weed management over synthetic herbicides, e.g. wheat production.

==== Plant-plant communication ====

Plants communicate with each other through both airborne and below-ground chemical cues. For example, when damaged by an herbivore, many plants emit an altered bouquet of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Various C6 fatty acids and alcohols (sometimes known as green leaf volatiles) are often emitted from damaged leaves, since they are break-down products of plant cell membranes. These compounds (familiar to many as the smell of freshly mown grass) can be perceived by neighboring plants where they may trigger the induction of plant defenses. It is debated to what extent this communication reflects a history of active selection due to mutual benefit as opposed to &quot;eavesdropping&quot; on cues unintentionally emitted by neighboring plants.

=== Insect-reptile interactions ===
Further information: predator-prey arms race

Reptiles interaction also contribute to chemical ecology via bioaccumulation or neutralization of toxic compounds. Diablito poison frog (&quot;Oophaga sylvatica)&quot; which feeds on leaf litter arthropods sequesters the poison cardenolides with no self harm. Species of dart frogs have evolved in similar fashion to the insects they consume via modification to their Na+/K+-ATPase. Again, similar to the insects they prey upon, the dart frog physiology has changed to allow for secretion of toxic chemicals such as batrachotoxins found on the skin of certain neotropical dendrobatid frogs. Modification to the Na+/K+-ATPase illustrates a co-evolution based on a predator-prey arms race where each must keep evolving to survive. Another example is the interactions between the horned lizards (&quot;Phrynosoma&quot; spp.) and harvester ants (&quot;Pogonomyrmex&quot; spp.). Horned lizards evolution has shown the blood contains a factor that metabolizes toxins produced by harvester ants. The metabolized poison is broken down and used in a specialized blood squirting defensive mechanism to defend the horned lizard against predators.

=== Insect-mammal interactions ===
Further information: benzoquinone and millipede

Mammals such as lemurs and monkeys demonstrate application of chemicals similar to how humans use chemicals for pest management and medical use. These applications vary from prevention of internal and external parasites or pathogens, decrease likelihood of infection, increase reproductive function, reducing inflammation, social cues, and more. Red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur ruffrons) have evolved two pathways, preventive measure for avoiding bioaccumulation, allowing for the modification of 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone and 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone a secretion of &quot;Spirostreptidae&quot; millipedes shown to inhibit certain bacterial species. Red-fronted lemurs have also been observed in rubbing the secretion on their fur similar to capuchins, this action uses benzoquinone compounds as repellent for various insects such as ticks and mosquitoes.

== Marine chemical ecology ==

=== Defense ===

Many marine organisms use chemical defenses to deter predators. For example, some crustaceans and mesograzers, such as the &quot;Pseudamphithoides incurvaria&quot;, use toxic algae and seaweeds as a shield against predation by covering their bodies in these plants. These plants produce phycotoxins, diterpenes such as pachydictyol-A and dictyol-E, which have been shown to deter predators. Demonstrating this symbiotic relationship are cyanobacteria and shrimp. The snapping shrimp &quot;Alpheus frontalis&quot; has been observed in utilizing &quot;Moorena bouillonii&quot;, a cyanobacterium, for shelter and food. &quot;M. bouillonii&quot; produces compounds that are toxic to other marine organisms and coral but its relationship with A. frontalis demonstrates the use of &quot;M. bouillonii&quot; as a deterrent and shelter to protect &quot;A. frontalis&quot;. Other marine organisms produce chemicals endogenously to defend themselves. For example, the finless sole (&quot;Pardachirus marmoratus&quot;) produces a toxin that paralyzes the jaws of would-be predators. Many zoanthids produce potent toxins, such as palytoxin, which is one of the most poisonous known substances. Some species of these zooanthids are very brightly colored, which may be indicative of aposematic defense. Another defensive measure that involves chemical ecology and marine ecology is the bobtail squid&#x27;s light organ. The bobtail which is located in Hawaii contains a light organ that houses consumed bacterium &quot;Vibrio fischeri,&quot; &quot;V. fisheri&quot; bacterium utilizes quorum sensing to indicate expression for bioluminescence, for down welling light intensity. Down welling light intensity allows the bobtail squid to hind from predators by mimicking moonlight and starlight intensity as it hunts for prey at night. There is also development of blue crab defense, which utilizes sensory organs for detecting chemical changes in the water to alert them of predators. When alerted blue crabs will hide as a defensive strategy. The urine from predators acts as a selective pressure so that blue crabs which are more sensitive to chemical change are likely to survive. Those that survive increase the likelihood that offspring develop the same sensory organs for detection. However, there is a distinctive difference between development of the sensory organs, ability to process or accumulate toxins or bacteria compared to leaned or habit developing defensive strategy.

=== Reproduction ===
Many marine organisms use pheromones as chemical cues alerting possible mates that they are ready to reproduce. For example, male sea lampreys attract ovulating females by emitting a bile that can be detected many meters downstream. Other processes can be more complex, such as the mating habits of crabs. Due to the fact that female crabs can only mate during a short period after moults from her shell, female crabs produces pheromones before she begins to moult in order to attract a mate. Male crabs will detect these pheromones and defend their potential mate until she has finished molted. However, due to the cannibalistic tendencies of crabs, the female produces an additional pheromone to suppresses cannibalistic instincts in her male guardian. These pheromones are very potent—so much so that they can induce male crabs to try to copulate with rocks or sponges that have been coated in pheromone by researchers. Furthermore, compound structure plays a key role, e.g. crab pheromones are specialized to travel in aquatic vs terrestrial environments.

=== Dominance ===

Dominance among crustaceans is also mediated through chemical cues. When crustaceans fight to determine dominance they urinate into the water. Later, if they meet again, both individuals can recognize each other by pheromones contained in their urine, allowing them to avoid a fight, if dominance has already been established. When a lobster encounters the urine of another individual, it will act differently according to the perceived status of the urinator (e.g. more submissively when exposed to the urine of a more dominant crab, or more boldly when exposed to the urine of a subdominant individual). When individuals are unable to communicate through urine, fights may be longer and more unpredictable.

== Applications of chemical ecology ==

=== Pest control ===
Chemical ecology has been utilized in the development of sustainable pest control strategies. Semiochemicals (especially insect sex pheromones) are widely used in integrated pest management for surveillance, trapping and mating disruption of pest insects. Unlike conventional insecticides, pheromone-based methods of pest control are generally species-specific, non-toxic and extremely potent. In forestry, mass trapping has been used successfully to reduce tree mortality from bark beetle infestations in spruce and pine forests and from palm weevils in palm plantations. In Australia, pheromone base trapping use was implemented to off set the use of pesticides due to the residues left behind in sheep wool. In an aquatic system, a sex pheromone from the invasive sea lamprey has been registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for deployment in traps. A strategy has been developed in Kenya to protect cattle from trypanosomiasis spread by Tsetse fly by applying a mixture of repellent odors derived from a non-host animal, the waterbuck. The use of sex pheromones depends on various factors such as concentration, ability to sense the pheromone, temperature, mixture of the pheromone with other compounds, and medium in which the pheromone is delivered, e.g. aquatic vs terrestrial.

The successful push-pull agricultural pest management system makes use of chemical cues from intercropped plants to sustainably increase agricultural yields. The efficacy of push-pull agriculture relies on multiple forms of chemical communication. Though the push-pull technique was invented as a strategy to control stem-boring moths, such as &quot;Chilo partellus&quot;, through the manipulation of volatile host-finding cues, it was later discovered that allelopathic substances exuded by the roots of &quot;Desmodium spp.&quot; also contribute to the suppression of the damaging parasitic weed, &quot;Striga&quot;.

=== Drug development and biochemistry discoveries ===
A large proportion of commercial drugs (e.g. aspirin, ivermectin, cyclosporin, taxol) are derived from natural products that evolved due to their involvement in ecological interactions. While it has been proposed that the study of natural history could contribute to the discovery of new drug leads, most drugs derived from natural products were not discovered due to prior knowledge of their ecological functions. However, many fundamental biological discoveries have been facilitated by the study of plant toxins. For example, the characterization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the first neurotransmitter receptor to be identified, ensued from investigations into the mechanisms of action of curare and nicotine. Similarly, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor takes its name from the fungal toxin muscarine. Whereas aquatic fungi provide specialized metabolites of interest for antibiotics, e.g. pestalone. Pestalone inhibits the growth of marine bacteria, the pathway to produce pestalone by marine fungi was found not to work when the bacteria is absent. The compound pestalone was derived from a marine fungus located in the Bahamas Islands on the surface of a brown alga, &quot;Rosenvingea sp&quot;. Development in biotechnology focuses on aquatic fungi in the pursuit of new antibiotics was inspired by terrestrial fungi, the cross over is not equivalent as demands in aquatic fungi are not exact to their terrestrial counter parts. Some aquatic fungi have shown changes to sphingolipid production under stressors such as acid resulting in the inhibition of biofilm formation. Whereas, wild type fungi are known to upregulate production of azole resistance drugs such as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and transporters Cdr1 and Cdr2 that act like pumps to remove the antifungal drugs. Sphingolipid and sterols are the majority of the lipid bilayer membrane in fungi, e.g &quot;Candida&quot; species, and assist in formation of biofilms. Understanding the mechanism is utilized for development of vaccine adjuvants. Biofilm production is initiated through quorum sensing. Example of quorum sensing are the LuxR and LuxI proteins that attribute to the bioluminescence in &quot;Vibrio fischeri,&quot; LuxI produces acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) that are received by LuxR of neighboring bacteria, a specific concentration of AHL triggers gene expression of bioluminescence. Some vaccine adjuvants focus on biofilm formation by aiming to disrupt the communication utilizing current knowledge on quorum sensing.

== History of chemical ecology ==
=== After 1950 ===

In 1959, Adolf Butenandt identified the first intraspecific chemical signal (bombykol) from the silk moth, &quot;Bombyx mori&quot;, with material obtained by grinding up 500,000 moths. The same year, Karlson and Lüscher proposed the term &#x27;pheromone&#x27; to describe this type of signal. Also in 1959, Gottfried S. Fraenkel also published his landmark paper, &quot;The Raison d&#x27;être of Secondary Plant Substances&quot;, arguing that plant secondary/ specialized metabolites are not metabolic waste products, but actually evolved to protect plants from consumers. Together, these papers marked the beginning of modern chemical ecology. In 1964, Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven coauthored a paper proposing their influential theory of escape and radiate coevolution, which suggested that an evolutionary &quot;arms-race&quot; between plants and insects can explain the extreme diversification of plants and insects. The idea that plant metabolites could not only contribute to the survival of individual plants, but could also influence broad macroevolutionary patterns, would turn out to be highly influential. However, Tibor Jermy questioned the view of an evolutionary arms race between plants and their insect herbivores and proposed that the evolution of phytophagous insects followed and follows that of plants without major evolutionary feedback, i.e. without affecting plant evolution. He coined the term sequential evolution to describe plant-insect macroevolutionary patterns, which emphasizes that selection pressure exerted by insect attack on plants is weak or lacking.

In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of plant biologists, ecologists, and entomologists expanded this line of research on the ecological roles of plant secondary/ specialized metabolites. During this period, Thomas Eisner and his close collaborator Jerrold Meinwald published a series seminal papers on chemical defenses in plants and insects. A number of other scientists at Cornell were also working on topics related to chemical ecology during this period, including Paul Feeny, Wendell L. Roelofs, Robert Whittaker and Richard B. Root. In 1968, the first course in chemical ecology was initiated at Cornell. In 1970, Eisner, Whittaker and the ant biologist William L. Brown, Jr. coined the terms allomone (to describe semiochemicals that benefit the emitter, but not the receiver) and kairomone (to describe semiochemicals that benefit the receiver only). Whittaker and Feeny published an influential review paper in &quot;Science&quot; the following year, summarizing the recent research on the ecological roles of chemical defenses in a wide variety of plants and animals and likely introducing Whittaker&#x27;s new taxonomy of semiochemicals to a broader scientific audience. Around this time, Lincoln Brower also published a series of important ecological studies on monarch sequestration of cardenolides. Brower has been credited with popularizing the term &quot;ecological chemistry&quot; which appeared in the title of a paper he published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1968 and again the following year in an article he wrote for &quot;Scientific American&quot;, where the term also appeared on the front cover under an image of a giant bluejay towering over two monarch butterflies.

The specialized &quot;Journal of Chemical Ecology&quot; was established in 1975, and the Journal &quot;Chemoecology&quot; was founded in 1990. In 1984, the International Society of Chemical Ecology was established and in 1996, the Max Planck Institute of Chemical Ecology was founded in Jena, Germany.

<text>Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), also called phthalocyanine blue, phthalo blue and many other names, is a bright, crystalline, synthetic blue pigment from the group of dyes based on phthalocyanines. Its brilliant blue is frequently used in paints and dyes. It is highly valued for its superior properties such as light fastness, tinting strength, covering power and resistance to the effects of alkalis and acids. It has the appearance of a blue powder, insoluble in most solvents including water.

==History==
The discovery of metal phthalocyanines can be traced to the observation of intensely colored byproducts from reactions of phthalic acid (benzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid) or its derivatives with sources of nitrogen and metals. CuPc (copper phthalocyanine) was first prepared in 1927 by the reaction of copper(I) cyanide and &quot;o&quot;-dibromobenzene, which mainly produces colorless phthalonitrile as well as an intensely blue by-product. A couple of years later, workers at Scottish Dyes observed the formation of traces of phthalocyanine dyes in the synthesis of phthalimide by the reaction of phthalic anhydride and ammonia in the presence of metallic iron. In 1937, DuPont started producing copper phthalocyanine blue in the USA under the trade name &quot;Monastral Blue&quot; after it had been previously launched in Great Britain (ICI) and Germany (I.G. Farbenindustrie) in 1935.

Difficulty was experienced in forming stable dispersions with the first alpha forms, especially in mixtures with rutile titanium, where the blue pigment tended to flocculate. The beta form was more stable, as was the improved stabilized alpha form. Today, there are even more isomeric forms available.

==Synonyms and trade names==
The substance, IUPAC name , is known by many names such as &quot;monastral blue&quot;, &quot;phthalo blue&quot;, &quot;helio blue&quot;, &quot;thalo blue&quot;, &quot;Winsor blue&quot;, &quot;phthalocyanine blue&quot;, &quot;C.I. Pigment Blue 15:2&quot;, &quot;copper phthalocyanine blue&quot;, &quot;copper tetrabenzoporphyrazine&quot;, &quot;Cu-phthaloblue&quot;, &quot;P.B.15.2&quot;, &quot;C.I. 74160&quot;, and British Rail Blue. Numerous other trade names and synonyms exist. The abbreviation &quot;CuPc&quot; is also used.

== Manufacture ==
Two manufacturing processes have gained commercial importance for the production of copper phthalocyanine:

* The phthalonitrile process, mainly used in Germany 
* The phthalic anhydride/urea process, developed in Great Britain and in the USA.

Both approaches can be carried out either without (baking process) or with a solvent (solvent process). Higher yields may be achieved with the solvent process (&gt; 95%) than with the baking process (70 to 80%), so that the solvent process has initially simulated more interest. However, recents trends show a reverse tendency for the baking process mainly on the grounds of economical and ecological concerns (solvent-free, shorter lead time).

=== Phthalonitrile process ===
This approach involves heating phthalonitrile with a copper salt, usually copper(I)chloride at 200 °C to 240 °C. The gross reaction equation from phthalonitrile may be written as follows:

=== Phthalic anhydride/urea process ===
The gross reaction equation from phthalic anhydride and urea may be written as follows:

==Applications==
===Catalysis===
Metal phthalocyanines have long been examined as catalysts for redox reactions. Areas of interest are the oxygen reduction reaction and the sweetening of gas streams by removal of hydrogen sulfide.

===Colorant===
Due to its stability, phthalo blue is also used in inks, coatings, and many plastics. The pigment is insoluble and has no tendency to migrate in the material. It is a standard pigment used in printing ink and the packaging industry. Industrial production was of the order of 10,000 tonnes per annum in the 1980s and 1990s in Japan alone. The pigment is the highest volume pigment produced.

All major artists&#x27; pigment manufacturers produce variants of copper phthalocyanine, designated color index PB15 (blue) and color indexes PG7 and PG36 (green).

A common component on the artist&#x27;s palette, phthalo blue is a cool blue with a bias towards green. It has intense tinting strength and easily overpowers the mix when combined with other colors. It is a transparent staining color and can be applied using glazing techniques.

It is present in a wide variety of products, such as color deposition hair conditioner, gel ink pens, eye patches, parfum, shampoo, skin-care products, soap, sunscreen, tattoo ink, toothpaste, and even turf colorants.

==Research==
CuPc has often been investigated in the context of molecular electronics. It is potentially suited for organic solar cells because of its high chemical stability and uniform growth. CuPc usually plays the role of the electron donor in donor/acceptor based solar cells. One of the most common donor/acceptor architectures is CuPc/C60 (buckminsterfullerene) which rapidly became a model system for the study of small organic molecules. Photon to electron conversion efficiency in such system reaches approximately 5%.

CuPc has also been investigated as a component of organic field-effect transistors.
Copper Phthalocyanine (CuPc) has been suggested for data storage in quantum computing, due to the length of time its electrons can remain in superposition.
CuPc can be easily processed into a thin film for use in device fabrication, which makes it an attractive qubit candidate.

==Derivatives and related compounds==
Approximately 25% of all artificial organic pigments are phthalocyanine derivatives. Copper phthalocyanine dyes are produced by introducing solubilizing groups, such as one or more sulfonic acid functions. These dyes find extensive use in various areas of textile dyeing (Direct dyes for cotton), for spin dyeing and in the paper industry. Direct blue 86 is the sodium salt of CuPc-sulfonic acid, whereas direct blue 199 is the quaternary ammonium salt of the CuPc-sulfonic acid. The quaternary ammonium salts of these sulfonic acids are used as solvent dyes because of their solubility in organic solvents, such as Solvent Blue 38 and Solvent Blue 48. The dye derived from cobalt phthalocyanine and an amine is Phthalogen Dye IBN. 1,3-Diiminoisoindolene, the intermediate formed during phthalocyanine manufacture, used in combination with a copper salt affords the dye GK 161.

Copper phthalocyanine is also used as a source material for manufacture of Phthalocyanine Green G.

Other related and commercially available phthalocyanines blue pigments are:

* Pigment Blue 16 – metal-free phthalocyanine 
* Pigment Blue 75 – cobalt phthalocyanine 
* Pigment Blue 79 – aluminum phthalocyanine

==Structure, reactivity and properties==

Copper phthalocyanine is a complex of copper(II) with the conjugate base of phthalocyanine, i.e. Cu2+Pc2−. The description is analogous to that for copper porphyrins, which are also formally derived by double deprotonation of porphyrins. CuPc belongs to the &quot;D&quot;4h point group. It is paramagnetic with one unpaired electron per molecule.

The substance is practically insoluble in water (&lt; 0.1 g/100 ml at ), but soluble in concentrated sulfuric acid. Density of the solid is ≈1.6 g/cm3. The color is due to a π–π* electronic transition, with λmax ≈ 610 nm.

===Crystalline phases===
CuPc crystallizes in various forms (polymorphs). Five different polymorphs have been identified: phases α, β, η, γ and χ. The two most common structures in CuPc are the β phase and the metastable α phase. Those phases can be distinguished by the overlap of their neighboring molecules. The α phase has a larger overlap and thus, a smaller Cu-Cu spacing (≈3.8 Å) compared to the β phase (≈4.8 Å).

===Toxicity and hazards===
The compound is non-biodegradable, but not toxic to fish or plants. No specific dangers have been associated with this compound. Oral LD50 in mammals is estimated to be greater than 5 g per kg, with no ill effects found at that level of ingestion, for chronic ingestion estimated dose of low concern was 0.2 mg/kg per day in rats. No evidence indicates carcinogenic effects. Sulfonated phthalocyanine has been found to cause neuroanatomical defects in developing chicken embryos when injected directly into incubating eggs.

<doc id="619325" wikidata="Q58685" url="?curid=619325" title="Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander">
<text>Friedrich Wilhelm August Argelander (22 March 1799 – 17 February 1875) was a German astronomer. He is known for his determinations of stellar brightnesses, positions, and distances.

== Life and work ==

Argelander was born in Memel in the Kingdom of Prussia (now Klaipėda in Lithuania), the son of a father of Finnish descent, Johann Gottlieb Argelander, and German (Prussian) mother, Dorothea Wilhelmina Grünhagen. He studied with Friedrich Bessel, whose assistant he became in 1820, and obtained his Ph.D. in 1822 at University of Königsberg. From 1823 until 1837, Argelander was the head of the Finnish observatory, first in Turku and then in Helsinki. He then moved to Bonn, Germany. There he designed and built a new observatory at the University of Bonn with funding approved directly by King Frederick William IV whom Argelander had become friends with in his childhood. This lifelong friendship had started when the then crown prince temporarily lived in Argelander&#x27;s parents house after the Prussian royal family fled to Memel after the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt during the Napoleonic Wars.

Argelander excelled in developing effective, simple and fast methods for measuring star positions and magnitudes, thereby making a pioneering work for modern astronomy. He also measured star distances with heliometers. His, and his collaborators&#x27;, great practical works of star cataloging and variable star research were made possible by the systematic usage of then newly developed techniques.

Argelander was the first astronomer to begin a careful study of variable stars. Only a handful were known when he began, and he was responsible for introducing the modern system of identifying them. He also made a rough determination of the direction in which the Sun was moving.

In 1842, he discovered that Groombridge 1830 had a very high proper motion. For many decades its proper motion was the highest known; today it still occupies third place. For a time, it was known as &quot;Argelander&#x27;s Star&quot;.

Together with Adalbert Krüger and Eduard Schönfeld, Argelander was responsible for the star catalogue known as the &quot;Bonner Durchmusterung&quot;, published between 1859 and 1862, which gave the positions and brightness of more than 324,000 stars, although it did not cover much of the southern half of the sky. This was the last star map to be published without the use of photography.

In 1863, Argelander helped lead in the founding of an international organization of astronomers named the &quot;Astronomische Gesellschaft&quot;.

== Honors and legacy ==

* Elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1846.
* Elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.
* Elected Member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.
* Was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1863.
* Orden Pour le Mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste (Order Pour le Mérite for Arts and Sciences - Civil class) in 1874.
* The three astronomical institutes of the Bonn University were merged and renamed as the &quot;Argelander-Institut für Astronomie&quot; in 2006.
* The crater Argelander on the Moon and the asteroid 1551 Argelander are named for him.

<text>Cuyahoga Valley National Park is a national park of the United States in Ohio that reclaims and preserves the industrial, commercial, and rural landscape along the Cuyahoga River between Akron and Cleveland in Northeast Ohio.

The park is administered by the National Park Service, but within its boundaries are areas independently managed as county parks or as public or private businesses. Cuyahoga Valley was originally designated as a national recreation area (NRA) in 1974, then redesignated as a national park 26 years later in 2000, and remains the only national park that originated as a national recreation area.

Cuyahoga Valley is the only national park in the state of Ohio and one of three in the Great Lakes Basin, with Isle Royale National Park in Lake Superior and Indiana Dunes National Park bordering Lake Michigan. Cuyahoga Valley also differs from the other national parks in the US in that it is adjacent to two large urban areas and it includes a dense road network, a railroad, high tension lines, small towns, commercial businesses, four reservations of the Cleveland Metroparks, four parks and one multipurpose trail of Summit Metro Parks, and public and private attractions. It was the twelfth-most visited American national park in 2023, attracting nearly 2.9 million visitors, primarily due to its proximity to Cleveland and Akron.

=== Indigenous history ===
The Hopewell Culture inhabited the area by ~200AD and constructed the Everett Mound near Everett within the park.

No Native American tribes currently have federal recognition in Ohio; however, the former inhabitants of the Cuyahoga Valley were Native Americans. The Wyandot, Iroquois, Ottawa, Ojibwe, Munsee, Potawatomi, Miami, Catawba, and Shawnee all lived in or traversed this area, but the Lenapé Nation, also known as the Lenape’wàk or Delaware Nation, are considered &quot;the Grandfathers&quot; of many Native Nations of the upper Ohio River Valley. They had a democratic and egalitarian sociopolitical structure where leaders (sachem) consulted elders who advocated for the expectations of the people before decisions were made. The Lenapé were actively involved in long-distance trade networks and were highly skilled at creating goods and art such as pottery, stone weaponry, clothing, and baskets. Wars, coercive treaties, and legislative changes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries resulted in Lenapé movement both west and south from their geographic origins in present-day New York City, the lower Hudson Valley, eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and northern Delaware, through the Ohio River Valley and Cuyahoga Valley, to current residencies primarily in Oklahoma and Ontario, Canada.
Land was vitally important to the Lenapé Nation. The fur trade required large hunting grounds, as did agriculture, which served as their central food source. As the Lenapé Nation was pushed west, ecological consistencies between present-day Pennsylvania and Ohio allowed them to continue similar agricultural, hunting, and fishing practices; however, as treaties and violent conflicts continued, the Lenapé were not permitted sufficient time to develop a relationship with land in the Ohio River Valley. While being pushed west, the Lenapé turned to each other to form alliances between Lenapé communities to preserve culture, territory, and resources.

The Lenapé’s hunting practices changed with the introduction of the fur trade. After contact with Europeans, the emphasis on hunting began to shift towards the demands of fur production rather than prioritizing sustainability. Because of this shift in Lenapé hunting practices, the populations of beavers and other fur-bearing animals plummeted. These trade networks depended on waterways used by indigenous people through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries:

Portage Path was located in modern-day Summit County, Ohio. The trail connected the Cuyahoga and Tuscarawas Rivers and was approximately eight miles in length. American Indians used this path to transport their canoes overland from one river to the other. Using canoes, American Indians could travel by water from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico except for this small section. Today, most of the path is located in the city of Akron, Ohio, although interested parties can follow signs that trace the path between the two rivers. Portage County received its name from Portage Path.

==== Treaties and conflict ====

The Cuyahoga Valley is no longer inhabited by the Lenapé Nation primarily due to coercive legislative processes and numerous violent conflicts. The 1795 Treaty of Greenville set the Cuyahoga River as the boundary between indigenous peoples&#x27; lands and European settlement. In 1805, of land, including the present-day Cuyahoga Valley National Park, was ceded in the Treaty of Fort Industry with a promise of a thousand dollar annual payout to each Native Nation that lost land (the Wyandot, Ottawa, Objibwe, Munsee, Lenapé, Potawatomi, and Shawnee). The treaty also included a clause that allowed for the continuation of indigenous hunting on the ceded land; however, that portion of the treaty was neglected in practice. Other treaties, also took Lenapé land without their full knowledge or consent. Today, the Lenapé Nation is more commonly referred to as the Delaware Nation and has its headquarters in Oklahoma, although there are also populations in Kansas, Wisconsin, and Ontario, Canada, as well as in their ancestral homelands, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.

=== Later history ===
The valley began providing recreation for urban dwellers in the 1870s when people came from nearby cities for carriage rides or leisure boat trips along the canal. In 1880, the Valley Railway became another way to escape urban industrial life. Actual park development began in the 1910s and 1920s with the establishment of Cleveland and Akron metropolitan park districts. In 1929, the estate of Cleveland businessman Hayward Kendall donated around the Ritchie Ledges and a trust fund to the state of Ohio. Kendall&#x27;s will stipulated that the &quot;property should be perpetually used for park purposes&quot;. The area was called Virginia Kendall Park, in honor of his mother. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built much of the park&#x27;s infrastructure including the Happy Days Lodge and the shelters at Octagon, the Ledges, and Kendall Lake. The Happy Days Lodge, near Peninsula, was constructed from 1938 to 1939 as a camp for urban children. The lodge is presently used only as a special events site.

=== Park creation ===
Although the regional parks safeguarded certain places, by the 1960s local citizens feared that urban sprawl would overwhelm the Cuyahoga Valley&#x27;s natural beauty. An additional concern was the environmental degradation of the Cuyahoga River via factory waste and sewage, along with fires that burned on the river in 1952 and 1969. Citizens joined forces with state and national government staff to find a long-term solution. Finally, on December 27, 1974, President Gerald Ford signed the bill establishing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, even as the administration recommended a veto because &quot;The Cuyahoga Valley possesses no qualities which qualify it for inclusion in the National Park System&quot; and the government was already providing funds for outdoor recreation.

After Congress authorized the land acquisition, it was left under the direction of Superintendent William C. Birdsell of the National Park Service and the Army Corps of Engineers . Under the direction of Birdsell, homes were either purchased outright, or given a scenic/preservation easement. There was no comprehensive plan to guide the land acquisition program, so the responsibility of choosing whether homes were to be purchased or preserved was solely Birdsell&#x27;s decision. Birdsell&#x27;s continually changing priorities frustrated local residents as land acquisition plans changed, and his management style was criticized by the National Park Service&#x27;s Midwest Regional Office during a 1978 operational evaluation report (OER), citing his poor human-resource management skills, low staff morale, and Birdsell&#x27;s inability to delegate.

=== National Park Service ===
The National Park Service acquired the Krejci Dump in 1985 to include as part of the recreation area. They requested a thorough analysis of the site&#x27;s contents from the Environmental Protection Agency. After the survey identified extremely toxic materials, the area was closed in 1986 and designated a superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980. Litigation was filed against potentially responsible parties: Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, 3M, Waste Management, Chevron, Kewanee Industries, and Federal Metals. Only 3M would not agree to a settlement, and the company lost at trial. Removal of toxic materials began in 1987 with of contaminated soils and debris removed by 2012, and restoration completed by 2015.

The area was redesignated a national park by Congress on October 11, 2000, with the passage of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, House Bill 4578, 106th Congress. The park is administered by the National Park Service. The David Berger National Memorial in Beachwood, a Cleveland suburb, is also managed through Cuyahoga Valley National Park.

The Richfield Coliseum, a multipurpose arena in the Cuyahoga River area, was demolished in 1999 and the vacant site became part of Cuyahoga Valley National Park upon its designation in 2000. The area has since become a grassy meadow that is a popular birdwatching site.

In 2024, Cuyahoga Valley National Park entered into a &quot;sister park&quot; agreement with Dartmoor National Park in Devon, England, with a focus on collaborating to improve conservation efforts. The agreement is the first of its kind between the National Park Service and an English national park.

==Wildlife==
Animals found in the park are animals typical throughout Ohio, including raccoons, muskrats, coyotes, skunks, red foxes, beavers, peregrine falcons, river otters, bald eagles, opossums, three species of moles, white-tailed deer, Canada geese, gray foxes, minks, great blue herons, and seven species of bats.

==Climate==

The Boston Mill Visitor Center at Cuyahoga Valley National Park has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;). The plant hardiness zone at Boston Store Visitor Center is 6a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of .

== Attractions ==

Cuyahoga Valley features natural, man-made, and private attractions, which is unusual for an American national park. The park includes compatible-use sites not owned by the federal government, such as four reservations of the Cleveland Metroparks, as well as four parks and one multipurpose trail of Summit Metro Parks.

The natural areas include forests, rolling hills, narrow ravines, wetlands, rivers, and waterfalls. About 100 waterfalls are located in the Cuyahoga Valley, with the most popular being the tall Brandywine Falls—the tallest waterfall in the park and the fourth-tallest in Ohio. The Ledges are a rock outcropping that provides a westward view across the valley&#x27;s wooded areas. Talus caves are located among the boulders in the forest around the Ledges.

The park has several trails, most notably the Towpath Trail, which follows a former stretch of the Ohio and Erie Canal and is popular for hiking, bicycling, and running. Skiing and sled-riding are available during the winter at Kendall Hills. Visitors can play golf, or take scenic excursions and railroad tours on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad during special events.

The park also features preserved and restored displays of 19th and early 20th century sustainable farming and rural living, most notably the Hale Farm and Village, while catering to contemporary cultural interests with art exhibits, outdoor concerts, and theater performances in venues such as Blossom Music Center and Kent State University&#x27;s Porthouse Theatre. In the mid-1980s, the park hosted the National Folk Festival.

=== Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail ===

The multi-purpose Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail was developed by the National Park Service and is the major trail through Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The trail traverses almost from Rockside Road in Independence in the north to Summit County&#x27;s Bike &amp; Hike trail in the south, following the Cuyahoga River for much of its length. Outhouse restrooms are available at several trailheads, and food and drink establishments are along Rockside Road, as well as the Boston Store in Peninsula, and at the seasonal farmer&#x27;s market on Botzum Road. Three visitor centers are located along the path: the Canal Exploration Center, Boston Store, and the Hunt House. The trail connects to a Cleveland Metroparks trail at Rockside Road, which continues another north. The Summit County trail continues through Akron and further south through Stark and Tuscarawas counties to Zoar, Ohio, almost continuously, with a single interruption. Sections of the towpath trail outside of Cuyahoga Valley National Park are owned and maintained by various state and local agencies. The trail also meets the Buckeye Trail in the national park near Boston Store. Another section of the Summit County Bike &amp; Hike Trail system is nearby, connecting to Brandywine Falls, Cleveland Metroparks&#x27; Bedford Reservation and the cities of Solon in Cuyahoga County, Hudson and Stow in Summit County, and Kent and Ravenna in Portage County.

Seasonally, the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad (CVSR) allows visitors to travel along the towpath from Rockside Road to Akron, embarking or disembarking at any of the stops along the way. The train is especially popular with bicyclists, and for viewing and photographing fall colors. CVSR is independently owned and operated.

==== History ====

The Towpath Trail follows the historic route of the Ohio and Erie Canal. Before the canal was built, Ohio was a sparsely settled wilderness where travel was difficult and getting crops to market was nearly impossible. The canal, built between 1825 and 1832, provided a new transportation route from Cleveland on Lake Erie, to Portsmouth on the Ohio River. The canal connected Ohio to the rest of the eastern United States. Numerous wayside exhibits provide information about canal features and sites of historic interest.

Visitors can walk or ride along the same path that the mules used to tow the canal boats loaded with goods and passengers. The scene is different than it was then; the canal was full of water carrying a steady flow of boats. Evidence of beavers can be seen in many places along the trail.

==== Stanford House (formerly Stanford Hostel) ====
Located in the scenic Cuyahoga Valley near Peninsula, Stanford House is a historic 19th-century farm home built in the 1830s by George Stanford, one of the first settlers in the Western Reserve. In 1978, the NPS purchased the property to serve as a youth hostel in conjunction with the American Youth Hostels (AYH) organization. In March 2011, Stanford Hostel became Stanford House, Cuyahoga Valley National Park&#x27;s first in-park lodging facility. The home was renovated by the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park and the National Park Service, and is only available to parties willing to rent the entire house. There are no other lodging facilities within the park, and camping and overnight parking are prohibited in the park.

==== Towpath trailheads ====
Within the national park, trailhead parking for the towpath trail is available along Canal Road, from north to south, at:
* Lock 39—west of intersection with Rockside Road; 
* &quot;Canal Exploration Center&quot;—at Hillside Road; 
* Frazee House—south of Alexander Road, north of Sagamore Road; 
and along Riverview Road, from north to south, at:
* Station Road Bridge—east along with Chippewa Creek Drive; 
* Red Lock—east of the river, along Vaughn/Highland Road; 
* &quot;Boston Store&quot;—east on Boston Mills Road; 
*&quot;Peninsula Depot&quot;—east across river on Route 303, then N Locust Street, and W Mill Street to parking lot; 
* Lock 28—also called Deep Lock; south of Major Road; 
* &quot;Hunt House&quot;—at Bolanz Road; 
* Ira Road—just north of intersection; 
*Botzum station—south of Bath Road; .

==Geology==

The &quot;V&quot; course of the Cuyahoga River is rather unusual, first flowing southwest, and then abruptly turning north to drain into Lake Erie not far from its origin. The left arm of this &quot;V&quot;, flowing north through the park, corresponds to an older preglacial valley, while the right arm corresponds to relatively new drainage. The new segment cut into the old at Cuyahoga Falls, the base of the &quot;V&quot;. Other streams have made routes into the Cuyahoga preglacial valley by cutting gorges with waterfalls such as those found along the Tinkers, Brandywine and Chippewa Creeks. These waterfalls form as flowing water erodes the Bedford Shale, which underlies the more resistant Berea Sandstone. Glacial drift fills the valley to a depth of . This fill is very complex due to ponding in front of the ice before and after each glaciation. Beach deposits, gravel bars and other shoreline deposits from Lake Maumee are found in the valley, as are gravels from the time of Lake Arkona, and ridges marking the shores of Lake Whittlesey, Lake Warren, and Lake Wayne.

A noticeable remnant of the Wisconsin glaciation is the Defiance moraine, which trends from Defiance in western Ohio, across the state into Pennsylvania. As Cushing et al. point out, &quot;The Defiance moraine represents the last notable stand of the glacial front in this region.&quot; The moraine varies in width from , and according to Leverett, &quot;it is like a broad wave whose crest stands 20 to 50 feet above the border of the plain outside it.&quot; This moraine forms a lobe that protrudes south into the valley for all the way to Peninsula, the lobe being wide at the north end, tapering to wide at the south end. Kames and eskers mark the terrain south of this moraine up to the southern extent of the glaciation.

The Berea Sandstone and the Bedford Shale were deposited in a river delta environment in the Lower Mississippian. River channels were incised into the Bedford Shale and subsequently these channels were filled by the Berea Sandstone. Besides setting the stage for majestic gorges and waterfalls within the valley, they have provided an economic use as well. The Berea Sandstone was quarried in Berea for grindstones and building stones, while the lowermost part of the Bedford Shale was quarried in South Euclid and Cleveland Heights for its bluestone.

The Sharon Conglomerate is a Lower Pennsylvanian formation composed of sandstone and conglomerate which forms, according to Cushing et al., &quot;disconnected patches or outliers that cap the highest hills... these outliers stand boldly above the surrounding country&quot; due to its resistance to erosion. The Boston Ledges are the most noteworthy example. As the Mississippian shale underneath is washed away, huge blocks of the Sharon result from the settling. As Cushing et al. explain, &quot;frost action aids in pushing these blocks apart, cracks are widened into caves, and a tangle of blocks results, separated by passages of uneven widths.&quot;

Shale gas has been produced in the area since 1883, when H.A. Mastick&#x27;s well was drilled in the Rockport Township to a depth of , yielding of gas daily. A gas boom occurred in 1914–1915, and by 1931, several hundred gas wells were producing from the Devonian Huron shale. Production came from shales thick at depths from . Pressures were flowing less than of gas daily, but was sufficient to furnish light for a house or two, and sometimes heat. As Cushing et al. pointed out in the 1930s, &quot;there are vast amounts of petroleum in the Devonian shales.&quot; Since then, the Marcellus Shale and the deeper Utica Shale have shown their economic potential.

== Visitor centers ==
The Canal Exploration Center is located along Canal Road at Hillside Road in Valley View, south of Rockside Road. The visitor center contains interactive maps and games related to the history of the canal, especially the years from 1825 to 1876. The canal-era building once served canal boat passengers waiting to pass through the Ohio and Erie Canal&#x27;s Lock 38.

Boston Store was constructed in 1836 and is located just east of Riverview Road. The building was used as a warehouse, store, post office, and a general gathering place. The visitor center has a museum featuring exhibits on canal boat-building. A short video is available, as well as maps, brochures and NPS passport stamps.

The Hunt House at Riverview and Bolanz Roads is typical of late-19th-century family farms in the Cuyahoga Valley. Visitors can obtain information about park activities and see exhibits about the area&#x27;s agricultural history. The farm is an ideal starting point for a hike or a bicycle ride as it is adjacent to the canal towpath trail.

The Frazee House on Canal Road in Valley View south of Rockside Road was constructed from 1825 to 1826, during the same years the northern section of the canal was dug. The house is a fine example of a Western Reserve home and features exhibits relating to architectural styles, construction techniques, and the Frazee family.

<text>The &quot;Mad&quot; Fold-In is a feature of the American humor and satire magazine &quot;Mad&quot;. Written and drawn by Al Jaffee until 2020, and by Johnny Sampson thereafter, the Fold-In is one of the most well-known aspects of the magazine, having appeared in nearly every issue of the magazine starting in 1964. The feature was conceived in response to centerfolds in popular magazines, particularly &quot;Playboy&quot;.

Explaining his original inspiration, Jaffee said:
In 2011, Jaffee reflected, &quot;The thing that I got a kick out of was... &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; showed a fold-in and the contestants all came up with the word they were looking for, which was &#x27;fold-in.&#x27; So I realized, I created an English language word.&quot;

The Fold-In is among the few recurring features remaining in &quot;Mad&quot; today, as the magazine switched to a nearly all-reprint format in 2019.

==Concept==
A &quot;Mad&quot; Fold-In consists of a single drawing, with a paragraph of text underneath, and a panel across the top with a question. Each Fold-In also features instructions on how to manipulate the Fold-In, as well as a picture illustrating the procedure. Under the instructions are two arrows labeled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. When the paper is folded so that points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are touching, the remaining unobscured text underneath the picture becomes the answer to the question, and the picture itself changes into a fresh image reflecting the new text, as the middle 50% of the drawing vanishes.

For example, a 1969 Fold-In asking, &quot;What is the one thing protest marches have greatly improved?&quot; depicted a stream of placard-carrying marchers, but folded into the image of the underside of a worn-out sole and the answer, &quot;SHOE SALES.&quot; A drawing of a fearsome panther stalking a variety of jungle animals accompanying the question &quot;What predatory creature most threatens the survival of endangered species?&quot; contracted to the image of a lavishly swaddled woman and the solution &quot;FUR LOVERS.&quot; (In the larger drawing, the two halves of her fur coat had been the foliage of trees.) Following the 1991 Tailhook scandal, a Navy war room became a female officer being sexually molested by a gauntlet of her comrades.

&quot;The Far Side&quot; creator Gary Larson described his experience with the Fold-In: &quot;The dilemma was always this: Very slowly and carefully fold the back cover... &quot;without&quot; creasing the page and quickly look at the joke. Jaffee&#x27;s artistry &quot;before&quot; the folding was so amazing that I suspect I was not alone in not wanting to deface it in any way.&quot;

&quot;Mad&quot; publisher Bill Gaines joked that he was a fan of the Fold-In because he knew that serious collectors valued pristine, unfolded copies, and would therefore be inspired to purchase two copies of each issue: one to fold and another to preserve intact.

In 1972, Jaffee received a Special Features Reuben Award for his Fold-Ins. A retrospective collection of his Fold-Ins, &quot;Fold This Book!&quot;, was published in 1997. A four-volume hardcover set, &quot;The Mad Fold-In Collection: 1964-2010&quot;, was released in September 2011.

==Execution==
Typically, a Fold-In used visual trickery to match the ostensible topic. Jaffee said, &quot;I could do ten of these a day if the big picture didn&#x27;t have any connection with the answer. The tricky part is having a connection. In order for the copy to read correctly after it&#x27;s folded, there has to be a marriage of some sort.&quot; Jaffee occasionally added an extra layer of deception. His Fold-In design for issue #495, for a question about &quot;packaging garbage,&quot; prominently showed two separate halves of the Pixar character Wall-E within a larger drawing of a junkyard. But both Wall-E halves were on the wrong side of the fold, and thus disappeared into the &quot;real&quot; picture, which was about the TMZ gossip website.

Jaffee only used a computer for typographic maneuvers, to make certain fold-in tricks easier to design. Otherwise, all of his work was done by hand. &quot;I&#x27;m working on a hard, flat board... I cannot fold it. That&#x27;s why my planning has to be so correct.&quot; In 2008, Jaffee told the &quot;Cape Cod Times&quot;, &quot;I never see the finished painting folded until it&#x27;s printed in the magazine. I guess I have that kind of visual mind where I can see the two sides without actually putting them together.&quot; Contrasting current art techniques and Jaffee&#x27;s approach, &quot;MAD&quot;&#x27;s art director, Sam Viviano, said, &quot;I think part of the brilliance of the fold-in is lost on the younger generations who are so used to Photoshop and being able to do stuff like that on a computer.&quot;

In 2016, AARP the Magazine did a feature on the eight &quot;Mad&quot; contributors who&#x27;d been with the magazine for 50 or more years. Editor John Ficarra described the process: &quot;We&#x27;ll call him up with a Fold-In idea and we&#x27;ll say, &#x27;In the first picture, we want the Civil War, and we have to have both the Confederate and Union soldiers in it, and there&#x27;s got to be a cannon in it. And then when you fold it in, it has to be Kim Kardashian on Rodeo Drive, and she has to have a dog in her hand. Good luck!&quot;

==History==
Jaffee&#x27;s first three Fold-Ins featured gags about the Elizabeth Taylor–Eddie Fisher–Richard Burton love triangle, Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s battle for the 1964 Republican presidential nomination, and The Beatles&#x27; departure back to England. Fold-In subjects from the mid-1970s dealt with the gas shortage, &quot;Saturday night special&quot; handguns, and revelations about the CIA bugging American citizens. Fold-In topics in the years 2008 and 2009 included &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, teen pregnancy, and Jay Leno temporarily leaving &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. &quot;Before anyone knew it,&quot; wrote comics historian Christopher Irving, &quot;the hundreds of Fold-Ins created a timeline of American history, political satire, and entertainment.&quot;

The third Fold-In, in issue #88, had an unusual diagonally-folded layout which was never repeated. The first 33 Fold-Ins were printed in black-and-white; starting with &quot;Mad&quot; #119 (June 1968), all Fold-Ins have been presented in color.

In a &quot;Mad&quot;-like wrinkle, there are two answers to the question &quot;When was Jaffee&#x27;s last Fold-in?&quot; The final one he designed appeared in the June 2019 issue. But his last Fold-in to be published, a personal farewell to readers, appeared in the August 2020 issue. Jaffee had prepared it six years in advance, to be published after his own death. Instead, it ran after he officially announced his retirement at the age of 99, as the conclusion of an &quot;All Jaffee&quot; tribute issue. It was the 509th issue of &quot;Mad&quot; to include new Jaffee material, the most for any contributor.

In 2010, Jaffee described the earliest Fold-Ins:
From its debut in 1964, the Fold-In has rarely been absent from &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s pages. Since issue #86, seven issues (#121, #190, #212, #219, #261, #353 and #360) did not feature Fold-Ins, although Jaffee still wrote and drew four of those issues&#x27; back covers. (#219 featured a see-through effect in which the back cover and inside back cover could be held up to a light source, with the separate elements of the two images combining to reveal a visual punchline.)

Mad Super Special #19 (Fall 1976) featured a bonus insert, &quot;Madde,&quot; an American Revolution-era &quot;Mad&quot; in honor of the U.S. Bicentennial. The insert included a Fold-In, showing a trade ship about to embark on a voyage, which folded into an African-American arm in chains.

Four Fold-Ins were patterned after Al Jaffee&#x27;s other &quot;Mad&quot; feature, Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions. The first, in #222, shows Humpty Dumpty sarcastically refusing to be put back together again, which folds into a plate of scrambled eggs. The second, in #233, takes place in a fairytale setting where a frog refuses to have a princess kiss him, folding into an image where the princess walks off saying &quot;I hope you freeze your ...&quot; and a donkey is in the frog&#x27;s place. The third, in #295, shows a wife confronting her husband over his cigarette smoking, folding into the wife mourning the husband at his funeral. The fourth, in #499, shows a snowboarder fending off stupid questions, folding into an image of him crashing into a stone wall.

In 2013, a completed Jaffee Fold-In about mass shootings was pulled from issue #521 when the editors realized the issue&#x27;s on-sale date would coincide with the beginning of Aurora theater shooter James Holmes&#x27; court trial, which had been delayed. This turned out to be untrue, as the trial was delayed until October 2014, some 18 months after the editorial decision to nix the Fold-In was made. The run of &quot;Mad&quot; covers, which had already been printed separately, was destroyed, and a repeat Fold-In from 1992 was used as a replacement. #521 thus became just the second issue of &quot;Mad&quot; since 1964 not to include new work by Jaffee. One copy was inadvertently sent out to a subscriber as a replacement copy, who scanned and uploaded the Fold-In. Jaffee missed three issues in 2019 due to illness; the mass shooting Fold-In that was yanked from issue #521 was finally published in 2019 in Mad Volume 2 issue #7, a reprint from 1972 was published in issue #8 and a reprint from 1967 was published in issue #9.

On occasion, the feature has been moved from its usual spot. Issue #320 (July 1993) featured a Fold-in as the front cover. And in the annual &quot;20 Worst of the Year&quot; issue, the Fold-In is used as one of the 20 items, thus appearing as an internal page of the magazine. Only two Mad 20 issues, #389 and #11, have had a Fold-In as part of the Mad 20 and a second one as the inside back cover. In issue #11 (February 2020) the Fold-In appearing in the Mad 20 was created by artist Johnny Sampson, making him the first artist to create a Fold-In other than Jaffee. The feature is currently being produced by Sampson.

In 1999, Jaffee told an interviewer, &quot;Usually you can go on working unless you have a stroke or something. So I hope to continue. I&#x27;m trying to decide whether I should do my final Fold-In before I die or after I die! [...] I don&#x27;t want to share it! It&#x27;s a secret! But I mentioned it to the editors at &quot;Mad&quot; and they said, &quot;You mean you want to get paid ahead of time!&quot;

Nevertheless, Jaffee&#x27;s final Fold-In appeared in the August 2020 issue of &quot;Mad&quot; after the cartoonist retired at the age of 99. Appearing during a stark recession, it depicted the magazine&#x27;s mascot Alfred E. Neuman with an atypically worried expression, in front of a dozen shuttered businesses. The question, &quot;Why is the &#x27;What, Me Worry?&#x27; kid so worried?&quot; was answered when the stores&#x27; signage folded into the message &quot;NO MORE JAFFEE FOLD-INS.&quot; A serene self-caricature appeared as a cloud.

Further Fold-ins are written and drawn by writer-artist Johnny Sampson.

==Outside cultural references==
A 1996 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; showed Bart Simpson and his friend Milhouse poring over a &quot;Mad&quot; Fold-In with the question &quot;What higher power do TV evangelists worship?” above a drawing of green mountains. Labelled “The All-Majestic Inspirational Mighty Dolomite Mtns Are a Singular Example of God’s Glory”, the peaks fold in to form a dollar sign, with the answer reading “The All-Mighty Dollar”. Later in the episode, Bart’s father Homer Simpson misfolds the page, reads “The All Ighty Ollar,” and laughs anyway. In a 1993 episode, Marge Simpson’s prison cellmate has a Fold-In tattooed onto her back; when she pushes her shoulder blades together, the question “What kind of slime would I marry?”, becomes &quot;What, me worry?&quot; and reveals the face of Mad mascot Alfred E. Neuman. A 2002 episode of &quot;Futurama&quot; features a pseudo-Fold-In. A graffitied building depicting the character Bender is demolished, and Bender wails as his image collapses into a set of buttocks and the boast “Bender Lives Large and Kicks Butt!” becomes “Bender Licks Butt!”.

On January 24, 2010, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a specially-constructed &quot;Fold-In&quot; crossword. The fully completed puzzle could be folded in the Jaffee style to reveal six further solutions, each of which was something that could itself be folded (e.g. LAWN CHAIR, NEWSPAPER, POKER HAND and ORIGAMI). Also mimicking &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s design, the top and bottom rows of the crossword both featured an &quot;A&quot; and a &quot;B&quot; in their horizontal grids, which needed to be folded together to touch one another to produce the desired result.

Beck&#x27;s 2005 video for &quot;Girl&quot; features a number of fold-ins, ranging from paper fold-ins to elaborate collapsible sets, including a foldable sidewalk and a foldable pharmacy. One of the video&#x27;s Fold-Ins reveals the name &quot;Al Jaffee&quot;.

In 2006, Stephen Colbert saluted Jaffee&#x27;s 85th birthday on an episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; with a large &quot;fold-in&quot; birthday cake, bearing the message
 AL, | |
 YOU| HAVE REPEATEDLY SHOWN |
 A|RTISTRY &amp; CA|RE
 O|F GREAT CREDIT TO YOUR FIE|LD
But after the center slice was removed, and the remainder pushed together, it spelled out the message
 AL, 
 YOU
 ARE
 OLD.

That was not Jaffee&#x27;s first interaction with Colbert. In 2010, he recalled:

==Career==

Since the late 1980s, Dorsey has worked with firms, non-profits, foundations, governments and a multitude of others on the interplay of multilateral environment policy, finance and economic development matters across the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. In 1991, Dorsey served as a youth delegate to the U.S. First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit. In 1992, Dorsey served as the youngest NGO representative on the United States Department of State Delegation the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1993, Dorsey served on the task force for Bill Clinton&#x27;s Council on Sustainable Development. In the mid-1990s Dorsey worked at the African Centre for Technology Studies at the request of the centre&#x27;s founder Calestous Juma.

After completing his Ph.D., from 2005 to 2012, Dorsey was assistant professor in Dartmouth College&#x27;s Environmental Studies Program and also the Director of the college&#x27;s Climate Justice Research Project. He was made a member of the Club of Rome in 2013. Dorsey has also been a visiting professor at Wesleyan University; in South Africa at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the University of the Witwatersrand; and in Sweden and at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. In South Africa at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the University of the Witwatersrand Dorsey worked closely and co-published with Professor Patrick Bond on climate justice, environmental racism and problems with emissions trading.

===Leadership===
In the late 20th century and early 21st century Dorsey served as Director of the Sierra Club. His first two consecutive terms were from 1997 to 2003 as a petition candidate that was nominated through the efforts of reform-activists known as the John Muir Sierrans. Dorsey was appointed and re-elected to the Sierra Club Board of Directors in 2012 (for two years) and 2014 (for a full three-year term). In total he has served eleven years as a Director on the national board of the Sierra Club.

Following Dartmouth College Dorsey was a visiting professor at Wesleyan University. There he collaborated with two former Wesleyan students: Evan Weber and Matthew Lichtash, and obtained a $30,000 grant plus free office space provided by the Sierra Club to draft an ambitious plan for climate action, which was the basis for the incorporation of the US Climate Plan 501(c)(3) nonprofit (aka Sunrise Movement Education Fund) incorporated in January 2014.

<doc id="619343" wikidata="Q16957680" url="?curid=619343" title="Ghettopoly">
<text>Ghettopoly is a parody of the board game &quot;Monopoly&quot; invented by David Chang, a Taiwanese American, and released in 2003. The game uses &quot;Monopoly&quot;-like mechanics but is themed around a caricature of a black ghetto in the United States.

==Gameplay and differences from &quot;Monopoly&quot;==
In &quot;Ghettopoly&quot;, the four railroad properties from the standard version of &quot;Monopoly&quot; are replaced by liquor stores. Other properties include a massage parlor, a peep show and a pawn shop. The &quot;Community Chest&quot; and &quot;Chance&quot; squares become &quot;Ghetto Stash&quot; and &quot;Hustle&quot; squares, while taxation squares are replaced by police-shakedown and carjacking squares.

Instead of building houses and hotels, property owners in &quot;Ghettopoly&quot; build crack houses and projects. The seven game pieces include: a pimp, a hoe, a 40 oz, a machine gun, a marijuana leaf, a crack rock, and a basketball.

==Official description==
===Contents===
*Game Board
*Loan Shark Tray
*40 Crack Houses
*17 Projects
*Pink Slip Cards
*Ghetto Stash and Hustle Cards
*7 game pieces (Pimp, Hoe, 40 oz, Machine Gun, Marijuana Leaf, Basketball and Crack Rock)
*Counterfeit Money
*2 Dice

==Racism and trademark issues==
The game was criticized as offensively racist by a local chapter of the NAACP and by black clergy, as well as by Asian American groups, including the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium and Organization of Chinese Americans.

The game was pulled from the market by Urban Outfitters, just one of its many retailers. Chang continued to market the game without their support. According to Chang&#x27;s website, which still sells the game, it is also available on Amazon. Another &quot;Monopoly&quot; variant, &quot;Redneckopoly&quot;, is also available at ghettopoly.com. Further such games were planned, including &quot;Hoodopoly&quot;, &quot;Hiphopopoly&quot;, and &quot;Thugopoly&quot;.

In October 2003, Hasbro sued Chang over the game&#x27;s similarities to &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In January 2006, Chang was found in contempt of court for failure to produce documents. The court thus entered a &quot;default judgment&quot; for Hasbro&#x27;s continued use of &quot;Monopoly&quot; as a trademark, and dismissed Chang&#x27;s counterclaims, which were to revoke trademark status on &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In May 2006, the court estimated that Chang generated US$8,790,000 in profits from the sale of &quot;Ghettopoly&quot;, and that damages of $400,000 were reasonable as reflected in the court documents.

<text>Structural inheritance or cortical inheritance is the transmission of an epigenetic trait in a living organism by a self-perpetuating spatial structures. This is in contrast to the transmission of digital information such as is found in DNA sequences, which accounts for the vast majority of known genetic variation.

Examples of structural inheritance include the propagation of prions, the infectious proteins of diseases such as scrapie (in sheep and goats), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (&#x27;mad cow disease&#x27;) and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (although the protein-only hypothesis of prion transmission has been considered contentious until recently). Prions based on heritable protein structure also exist in yeast. Structural inheritance has also been seen in the orientation of cilia in protozoans such as &quot;Paramecium&quot; and &quot;Tetrahymena&quot;, and &#x27;handedness&#x27; of the spiral of the cell in &quot;Tetrahymena&quot;, and shells of snails. Some organelles also have structural inheritance, such as the centriole, and the cell itself (defined by the plasma membrane) may also be an example of structural inheritance. To emphasize the difference of the molecular mechanism of structural inheritance from the canonical Watson-Crick base pairing mechanism of transmission of genetic information, the term &#x27;epigenetic templating&#x27; was introduced.

==History==
Structural inheritance was discovered by Tracy Sonneborn, and other researchers, during his study on protozoa in the late 1930s. Sonneborn demonstrated during his research on Paramecium that the structure of the cortex was not dependent on genes, or the liquid cytoplasm, but in the cortical structure of the surface of the ciliates. Preexisting cell surface structures provided a template that was passed on for many generations.

John R. Preer, Jr., following up on Sonneborn&#x27;s work, says, &quot;The arrangement of surface structures is inherited, but how is not known, Macronuclei pass on many of their characteristics to new macronuclei, by an unknown and mysterious mechanism.&quot;

Other researchers have come to the conclusion that &quot;the phenomena of cortical inheritance (and related nongenic, epigenetic processes) remind us that the fundamental reproductive unit of life is not a nucleic acid molecule, but the remarkably versatile, intact, living cell.&quot;

The study of structural inheritance is part of the extended evolutionary synthesis.

==In popular culture==
An article in &quot;Newsweek&quot; mentions research that shows that &quot;Some water fleas sport a spiny helmet that deters predators; others, with identical DNA sequences, have bare heads. What differs between the two is not their genes but their mothers&#x27; experiences. If mom had a run-in with predators, her offspring have helmets, an effect one wag called &quot;bite the mother, fight the daughter.&quot; If mom lived her life unthreatened, her offspring have no helmets. Same DNA, different traits. Somehow, the experience of the mother, not only her DNA sequences, has been transmitted to her offspring.&quot;

Various additional examples of structural inheritance are presented in the recent book &quot;Origination of Organismal Form&quot;.

<doc id="619350" wikidata="Q1061410" url="?curid=619350" title="Program evaluation">
<text>Program evaluation is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs, particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. 

In the public, private, and voluntary sector, stakeholders might be required to assess—under law or charter—or want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or opposing are producing the promised effect. To some degree, program evaluation falls under traditional cost–benefit analysis, concerning fair returns on the outlay of economic and other assets; however, social outcomes can be more complex to assess than market outcomes, and a different skillset is required. Considerations include how much the program costs per participant, program impact, how the program could be improved, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unforeseen consequences, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful. Evaluators help to answer these questions. Best practice is for the evaluation to be a joint project between evaluators and stakeholders. 

A wide range of different titles are applied to program evaluators, perhaps haphazardly at times, but there are some established usages: those who regularly use program evaluation skills and techniques on the job are known as Program Analysts; those whose positions combine administrative assistant or secretary duties with program evaluation are known as Program Assistants, Program Clerks (United Kingdom), Program Support Specialists, or Program Associates; those whose positions add lower-level project management duties are known as Program Coordinators. 

The process of evaluation is considered to be a relatively recent phenomenon. However, planned social evaluation has been documented as dating as far back as 2200 BC. Evaluation became particularly relevant in the U.S. in the 1960s during the period of the Great Society social programs associated with the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.

Program evaluations can involve both quantitative and qualitative methods of social research. People who do program evaluation come from many different backgrounds, such as sociology, psychology, economics, social work, as well as political science subfields such as public policy and public administration who have studied a similar methodology known as policy analysis. Some universities also have specific training programs, especially at the postgraduate level in program evaluation, for those who studied an undergraduate subject area lacking in program evaluation skills.

==Conducting an evaluation==
Program evaluation may be conducted at several stages during a program&#x27;s lifetime. Each of these stages raises different questions to be answered by the evaluator, and correspondingly different evaluation approaches are needed. Rossi, Lipsey and Freeman (2004) suggest the following kinds of assessment, which may be appropriate at these different stages:

* Assessment of the need for the program
* Assessment of program design and logic/theory
* Assessment of how the program is being implemented (i.e., is it being implemented according to plan? Are the program&#x27;s processes maximizing possible outcomes?)
* Assessment of the program&#x27;s outcome or impact (i.e., what it has actually achieved)
* Assessment of the program&#x27;s cost and efficiency

===Assessing needs===
A needs assessment examines the population that the program intends to target, to see whether the need as conceptualized in the program actually exists in the population; whether it is, in fact, a problem; and if so, how it might best be dealt with. This includes identifying and diagnosing the actual problem the program is trying to address, who or what is affected by the problem, how widespread the problem is, and what are the measurable effects that are caused by the problem. For example, for a housing program aimed at mitigating homelessness, a program evaluator may want to find out how many people are homeless in a given geographic area and what their demographics are. Rossi, Lipsey and Freeman (2004) caution against undertaking an intervention without properly assessing the need for one, because this might result in a great deal of wasted funds if the need did not exist or was misconceived.

Needs assessment involves the processes or methods used by evaluators to describe and diagnose social needs
This is essential for evaluators because they need to identify whether programs are effective and they cannot do this unless they have identified what the problem/need is. Programs that do not do a needs assessment can have the illusion that they have eradicated the problem/need when in fact there was no need in the first place. Needs assessment involves research and regular consultation with community stakeholders and with the people that will benefit from the project before the program can be developed and implemented. Hence it should be a bottom-up approach. In this way potential problems can be realized early because the process would have involved the community in identifying the need and thereby allowed the opportunity to identify potential barriers.

The important task of a program evaluator is thus to:
First, construct a precise definition of what the problem is. Evaluators need to first identify the problem/need. This is most effectively done by collaboratively including all possible stakeholders, i.e., the community impacted by the potential problem, the agents/actors working to address and resolve the problem, funders, etc. Including buy-in early on in the process reduces potential for push-back, miscommunication, and incomplete information later on.

Second, assess the extent of the problem.
Having clearly identified what the problem is, evaluators need to then assess the extent of the problem. They need to answer the ‘where’ and ‘how big’ questions. Evaluators need to work out where the problem is located and how big it is. Pointing out that a problem exists is much easier than having to specify where it is located and how rife it is. Rossi, Lipsey &amp; Freeman (2004) gave an example that: a person identifying some battered children may be enough evidence to persuade one that child abuse exists. But indicating how many children it affects and where it is located geographically and socially would require knowledge about abused children, the characteristics of perpetrators and the impact of the problem throughout the political authority in question.

This can be difficult considering that child abuse is not a public behavior, also keeping in mind that estimates of the rates on private behavior are usually not possible because of factors like unreported cases. In this case evaluators would have to use data from several sources and apply different approaches in order to estimate incidence rates. There are two more questions that need to be answered:
Evaluators need to also answer the ’how’ and ‘what’ questions The ‘how’ question requires that evaluators determine how the need will be addressed. Having identified the need and having familiarized oneself with the community evaluators should conduct a performance analysis to identify whether the proposed plan in the program will actually be able to eliminate the need. The ‘what’ question requires that evaluators conduct a task analysis to find out what the best way to perform would be. For example, whether the job performance standards are set by an organization or whether some governmental rules need to be considered when undertaking the task.

Third, define and identify the target of interventions and accurately describe the nature of the service needs of that population
It is important to know what/who the target population is/are – it might be individuals, groups, communities, etc. There are three units of the population: population at risk, population in need and population in demand
* Population at risk: are people with a significant probability of developing the risk e.g. the population at risk for birth control programs are women of child-bearing age.
* Population in need: are people with the condition that the program seeks to address; e.g. the population in need for a program that aims to provide ARV&#x27;s to HIV positive people are people that are HIV positive.
* Population in demand: that part of the population in need that agrees to be having the need and are willing to take part in what the program has to offer e.g. not all HIV positive people will be willing to take ARV&#x27;s.
Being able to specify what/who the target is will assist in establishing appropriate boundaries, so that interventions can correctly address the target population and be feasible to apply&lt;

There are four steps in conducting a needs assessment:
#Perform a ‘gap’ analyses
#:Evaluators need to compare current situation to the desired or necessary situation. The difference or the gap between the two situations will help identify the need, purpose and aims of the program.
#Identify priorities and importance
#:In the first step above, evaluators would have identified a number of interventions that could potentially address the need e.g. training and development, organization development etc. These must now be examined in view of their significance to the program&#x27;s goals and constraints. This must be done by considering the following factors: cost effectiveness (consider the budget of the program, assess cost/benefit ratio), executive pressure (whether top management expects a solution) and population (whether many key people are involved).
# Identify causes of performance problems and/or opportunities
#:When the needs have been prioritized the next step is to identify specific problem areas within the need to be addressed. And to also assess the skills of the people that will be carrying out the interventions.
# Identify possible solutions and growth opportunities
#:Compare the consequences of the interventions if it was to be implemented or not.
Needs analysis is hence a very crucial step in evaluating programs because the effectiveness of a program cannot be assessed unless we know what the problem was in the first place.

===Assessing program theory===
The program theory, also called a logic model, knowledge map, or impact pathway, is an assumption, implicit in the way the program is designed, about how the program&#x27;s actions are supposed to achieve the outcomes it intends. This &#x27;logic model&#x27; is often not stated explicitly by people who run programs, it is simply assumed, and so an evaluator will need to draw out from the program staff how exactly the program is supposed to achieve its aims and assess whether this logic is plausible. For example, in an HIV prevention program, it may be assumed that educating people about HIV/AIDS transmission, risk and safe sex practices will result in safer sex being practiced. However, research in South Africa increasingly shows that in spite of increased education and knowledge, people still often do not practice safe sex. Therefore, the logic of a program which relies on education as a means to get people to use condoms may be faulty. This is why it is important to read research that has been done in the area.
Explicating this logic can also reveal unintended or unforeseen consequences of a program, both positive and negative. The program theory drives the hypotheses to test for impact evaluation. Developing a logic model can also build common understanding amongst program staff and stakeholders about what the program is actually supposed to do and how it is supposed to do it, which is often lacking (see Participatory impact pathways analysis). Of course, it is also possible that during the process of trying to elicit the logic model behind a program the evaluators may discover that such a model is either incompletely developed, internally contradictory, or (in worst cases) essentially nonexisistent. This decidedly limits the effectiveness of the evaluation, although it does not necessarily reduce or eliminate the program.

Creating a logic model is a wonderful way to help visualize important aspects of programs, especially when preparing for an evaluation. An evaluator should create a logic model with input from many different stake holders. Logic Models have 5 major components: Resources or Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Short-term outcomes, and Long-term outcomes Creating a logic model helps articulate the problem, the resources and capacity that are currently being used to address the problem, and the measurable outcomes from the program. Looking at the different components of a program in relation to the overall short-term and long-term goals allows for illumination of potential misalignments. Creating an actual logic model is particularly important because it helps clarify for all stakeholders: the definition of the problem, the overarching goals, and the capacity and outputs of the program.

Rossi, Lipsey &amp; Freeman (2004) suggest four approaches and procedures that can be used to assess the program theory. These approaches are discussed below.
* Assessment in relation to social needs 
This entails assessing the program theory by relating it to the needs of the target population the program is intended to serve. If the program theory fails to address the needs of the target population it will be rendered ineffective even when if it is well implemented.
* Assessment of logic and plausibility
This form of assessment involves asking a panel of expert reviewers to critically review the logic and plausibility of the assumptions and expectations inherent in the program&#x27;s design. The review process is unstructured and open ended so as to address certain issues on the program design. Rutman (1980), Smith (1989), and Wholly (1994) suggested the questions listed below to assist with the review process.
:Are the program goals and objectives well defined?
:Are the program goals and objectives feasible?
:Is the change process presumed in the program theory feasible?
:Are the procedures for identifying members of the target population, delivering service to them, and sustaining that service through completion well defined and sufficient?
:Are the constituent components, activities, and functions of the program well defined and sufficient?
:Are the resources allocated to the program and its various activities adequate?

* Assessment through comparison with research and practice 
This form of assessment requires gaining information from research literature and existing practices to assess various components of the program theory. The evaluator can assess whether the program theory is congruent with research evidence and practical experiences of programs with similar concepts.

* Assessment via preliminary observation 
This approach involves incorporating firsthand observations into the assessment process as it provides a reality check on the concordance between the program theory and the program itself. The observations can focus on the attainability of the outcomes, circumstances of the target population, and the plausibility of the program activities and the supporting resources.

These different forms of assessment of program theory can be conducted to ensure that the program theory is sound.

Wright and Wallis (2019) described an additional technique for assessing a program theory based on the theory&#x27;s &quot;structure&quot;. This approach, known as integrative propositional analysis (IPA), is based on research streams finding that theories were more likely to work as expected when they had better structure (in addition meaning and data). IPA involves, first, identifying the propositions (statements of cause-and-effect) and creating a visual diagram of those propositions. Then, the researcher examines the number of concepts and causal relationships between them (circles and arrows on the diagram) to measure the breadth and depth of understanding reflected in the theory&#x27;s structure. The measure for &quot;breadth&quot; is the number of concepts. This is based on the idea that real-world programs involve a lot of interconnected parts, therefore a theory that shows a larger number of concepts shows greater breadth of understanding of the program. The &quot;depth&quot; is the percentage of concepts that are the result of more than one other concept. This is based on the idea that, in real-world programs, things have more than one cause. Hence, a concept that is the result of more than one other concept in the theory shows better understanding of that concept; a theory with a higher percentage of better-understood concepts shows a greater depth of understanding of the program.

===Assessing implementation===
Process analysis looks beyond the theory of what the program is supposed to do and instead evaluates how the program is being implemented. This evaluation determines whether the components identified as critical to the success of the program are being implemented. The evaluation determines whether target populations are being reached, people are receiving the intended services, staff are adequately qualified. Process evaluation is an ongoing process in which repeated measures may be used to evaluate whether the program is being implemented effectively. This problem is particularly critical because many innovations, particularly in areas like education and public policy, consist of fairly complex chains of action. For example, process evaluation can be used in public health research. Many of which these elements rely on the prior correct implementation of other elements, and will fail if the prior implementation was not done correctly. This was conclusively demonstrated by Gene V. Glass and many others during the 1980s. Since incorrect or ineffective implementation will produce the same kind of neutral or negative results that would be produced by correct implementation of a poor innovation, it is essential that evaluation research assess the implementation process itself. Otherwise, a good innovative idea may be mistakenly characterized as ineffective, where in fact it simply had never been implemented as designed.

===Assessing the impact (effectiveness)===
The impact evaluation determines the causal effects of the program. This involves trying to measure if the program has achieved its intended outcomes, i.e. program outcomes.

====Program outcomes====
An outcome is the state of the target population or the social conditions that a program is expected to have changed. Program outcomes are the observed characteristics of the target population or social conditions, not of the program. Thus the concept of an outcome does not necessarily mean that the program targets have actually changed or that the program has caused them to change in any way.

There are two kinds of outcomes, namely outcome level and outcome change, also associated with program effect.
*Outcome level refers to the status of an outcome at some point in time.
*Outcome change refers to the difference between outcome levels at different points in time.
*Program effect refers to that portion of an outcome change that can be attributed uniquely to a program as opposed to the influence of some other factor.

====Measuring program outcomes====
Outcome measurement is a matter of representing the circumstances defined as the outcome by means of observable indicators that vary systematically with changes or differences in those circumstances. Outcome measurement is a systematic way to assess the extent to which a program has achieved its intended outcomes. According to Mouton (2009) measuring the impact of a program means demonstrating or estimating the accumulated differentiated proximate and emergent effect, some of which might be unintended and therefore unforeseen.

Outcome measurement serves to help understand whether the program is effective or not. It further helps to clarify understanding of a program. But the most important reason for undertaking the effort is to understand the impacts of the work on the people being served. With the information collected, it can be determined which activities to continue and build upon, and which need to be changed in order to improve the effectiveness of the program.

This can involve using sophisticated statistical techniques in order to measure the effect of the program and to find causal relationship between the program and the various outcomes.

===Assessing efficiency===
Finally, cost-benefit or cost-efficiency analysis assesses the efficiency of a program. Evaluators outline the benefits and cost of the program for comparison. An efficient program has a lower cost-benefit ratio. There are two types of efficiency, namely, static and dynamic. While static efficiency concerns achieving the objectives with least costs, dynamic efficiency concerns continuous improvement.
==Determining causation==
Perhaps the most difficult part of evaluation is determining whether the program itself is causing the changes that are observed in the population it was aimed at. Events or processes outside of the program may be the real cause of the observed outcome (or the real prevention of the anticipated outcome).

Causation is difficult to determine. One main reason for this is self selection bias. People select themselves to participate in a program. For example, in a job training program, some people decide to participate and others do not. Those who do participate may differ from those who do not in important ways. They may be more determined to find a job or have better support resources. These characteristics may actually be causing the observed outcome of increased employment, not the job training program.

Evaluations conducted with random assignment are able to make stronger inferences about causation. Randomly assigning people to participate or to not participate in the program, reduces or eliminates self-selection bias. Thus, the group of people who participate would likely be more comparable to the group who did not participate.

However, since most programs cannot use random assignment, causation cannot be determined. Impact analysis can still provide useful information. For example, the outcomes of the program can be described. Thus the evaluation can describe that people who participated in the program were more likely to experience a given outcome than people who did not participate.

If the program is fairly large, and there are enough data, statistical analysis can be used to make a reasonable case for the program by showing, for example, that other causes are unlikely.

==Reliability, validity and sensitivity==
It is important to ensure that the instruments (for example, tests, questionnaires, etc.) used in program evaluation are as reliable, valid and sensitive as possible. According to Rossi et al. (2004, p. 222), &#x27;a measure that is poorly chosen or poorly conceived can completely undermine the worth of an impact assessment by producing misleading estimates. Only if outcome measures are valid, reliable and appropriately sensitive can impact assessments be regarded as credible&#x27;.

===Reliability===
The reliability of a measurement instrument is the &#x27;extent to which the measure produces the same results when used repeatedly to measure the same thing&#x27; (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 218). The more reliable a measure is, the greater its statistical power and the more credible its findings. If a measuring instrument is unreliable, it may dilute and obscure the real effects of a program, and the program will &#x27;appear to be less effective than it actually is&#x27; (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). Hence, it is important to ensure the evaluation is as reliable as possible.

===Validity===
The validity of a measurement instrument is &#x27;the extent to which it measures what it is intended to measure&#x27; (Rossi et al., 2004, p. 219). This concept can be difficult to accurately measure: in general use in evaluations, an instrument may be deemed valid if accepted as valid by the stakeholders (stakeholders may include, for example, funders, program administrators, et cetera).

===Sensitivity===
The principal purpose of the evaluation process is to measure whether the program has an effect on the social problem it seeks to redress; hence, the measurement instrument must be sensitive enough to discern these potential changes (Rossi et al., 2004). A measurement instrument may be insensitive if it contains items measuring outcomes which the program couldn&#x27;t possibly effect, or if the instrument was originally developed for applications to individuals (for example standardized psychological measures) rather than to a group setting (Rossi et al., 2004). These factors may result in &#x27;noise&#x27; which may obscure any effect the program may have had.

Only measures which adequately achieve the benchmarks of reliability, validity and sensitivity can be said to be credible evaluations. It is the duty of evaluators to produce credible evaluations, as their findings may have far reaching effects. A discreditable evaluation which is unable to show that a program is achieving its purpose when it is in fact creating positive change may cause the program to lose its funding undeservedly.

==Steps to program evaluation framework==
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) delineates six steps to a complete program evaluation. The steps described are: engage stakeholder, describe the program, focus the evaluation design, gather credible evidence, justify conclusions, and ensure use and share lessons learned. These steps can happen in a cycle framework to represent the continuing process of evaluation.

==Evaluating collective impact==
Though program evaluation processes mentioned here are appropriate for most programs, highly complex non-linear initiatives, such as those using the collective impact (CI) model, require a dynamic approach to evaluation. Collective impact is &quot;the commitment of a group of important actors from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem&quot; and typically involves three stages, each with a different recommended evaluation approach:

* Early phase: CI participants are exploring possible strategies and developing plans for action. Characterized by uncertainty.
&quot;Recommended evaluation approach:&quot; Developmental evaluation to help CI partners understand the context of the initiative and its development: &quot;Developmental evaluation involves real time feedback about what is emerging in complex dynamic systems as innovators seek to bring about systems change.&quot;

* Middle phase: CI partners implement agreed upon strategies. Some outcomes become easier to anticipate.
&quot;Recommended evaluation approach:&quot; Formative evaluation to refine and improve upon the progress, as well as continued developmental evaluation to explore new elements as they emerge. Formative evaluation involves &quot;careful monitoring of processes in order to respond to emergent properties and any unexpected outcomes.&quot;

* Later phase: Activities achieve stability and are no longer in formation. Experience informs knowledge about which activities may be effective.
&quot;Recommended evaluation approach:&quot; Summative evaluation &quot;uses both quantitative and qualitative methods in order to get a better understanding of what [the] project has achieved, and how or why this has occurred.&quot;

==Planning a program evaluation==
Planning a program evaluation can be broken up into four parts: focusing the evaluation, collecting the information, using the information, and managing the evaluation. Program evaluation involves reflecting on questions about evaluation purpose, what questions are necessary to ask, and what will be done with information gathered. Critical questions for consideration include:
*What am I going to evaluate?
*What is the purpose of this evaluation?
*Who will use this evaluation? How will they use it?
*What questions is this evaluation seeking to answer?
*What information do I need to answer the questions?
*When is the evaluation needed? What resources do I need?
*How will I collect the data I need?
*How will data be analyzed?
*What is my implementation timeline?

==Methodological constraints and challenges==
===The shoestring approach===
The &quot;shoestring evaluation approach&quot; is designed to assist evaluators operating under limited budget, limited access or availability of data and limited turnaround time, to conduct effective evaluations that are methodologically rigorous(Bamberger, Rugh, Church &amp; Fort, 2004). This approach has responded to the continued greater need for evaluation processes that are more rapid and economical under difficult circumstances of budget, time constraints and limited availability of data. However, it is not always possible to design an evaluation to achieve the highest standards available. Many programs do not build an evaluation procedure into their design or budget. Hence, many evaluation processes do not begin until the program is already underway, which can result in time, budget or data constraints for the evaluators, which in turn can affect the reliability, validity or sensitivity of the evaluation. &gt; The shoestring approach helps to ensure that the maximum possible methodological rigor is achieved under these constraints.

===Budget constraints===
Frequently, programs are faced with budget constraints because most original projects do not include a budget to conduct an evaluation (Bamberger et al., 2004). Therefore, this automatically results in evaluations being allocated smaller budgets that are inadequate for a rigorous evaluation. Due to the budget constraints it might be difficult to effectively apply the most appropriate methodological instruments. These constraints may consequently affect the time available in which to do the evaluation (Bamberger et al., 2004). Budget constraints may be addressed by simplifying the evaluation design, revising the sample size, exploring economical data collection methods (such as using volunteers to collect data, shortening surveys, or using focus groups and key informants) or looking for reliable secondary data (Bamberger et al., 2004).

===Time constraints===
The most time constraint that can be faced by an evaluator is when the evaluator is summoned to conduct an evaluation when a project is already underway if they are given limited time to do the evaluation compared to the life of the study, or if they are not given enough time for adequate planning. Time constraints are particularly problematic when the evaluator is not familiar with the area or country in which the program is situated (Bamberger et al., 2004). Time constraints can be addressed by the methods listed under budget constraints as above, and also by careful planning to ensure effective data collection and analysis within the limited time space.

===Data constraints===
If the evaluation is initiated late in the program, there may be no baseline data on the conditions of the target group before the intervention began (Bamberger et al., 2004). Another possible cause of data constraints is if the data have been collected by program staff and contain systematic reporting biases or poor record keeping standards and is subsequently of little use (Bamberger et al., 2004). Another source of data constraints may result if the target group are difficult to reach to collect data from - for example homeless people, drug addicts, migrant workers, et cetera (Bamberger et al., 2004). Data constraints can be addressed by reconstructing baseline data from secondary data or through the use of multiple methods. Multiple methods, such as the combination of qualitative and quantitative data can increase validity through triangulation and save time and money.
Additionally, these constraints may be dealt with through careful planning and consultation with program stakeholders. By clearly identifying and understanding client needs ahead of the evaluation, costs and time of the evaluative process can be streamlined and reduced, while still maintaining credibility.

All in all, time, monetary and data constraints can have negative implications on the validity, reliability and transferability of the evaluation. The shoestring approach has been created to assist evaluators to correct the limitations identified above by identifying ways to reduce costs and time, reconstruct baseline data and to ensure maximum quality under existing constraints (Bamberger et al., 2004).

===Five-tiered approach===
The five-tiered approach to evaluation further develops the strategies that the shoestring approach to evaluation is based upon. It was originally developed by Jacobs (1988) as an alternative way to evaluate community-based programs and as such was applied to a statewide child and family program in Massachusetts, U.S.A. The five-tiered approach is offered as a conceptual framework for matching evaluations more precisely to the characteristics of the programs themselves, and to the particular resources and constraints inherent in each evaluation context. In other words, the five-tiered approach seeks to tailor the evaluation to the specific needs of each evaluation context.

The earlier tiers (1-3) generate descriptive and process-oriented information while the later tiers (4-5) determine both the short-term and the long-term effects of the program. The five levels are organized as follows:
* Tier 1: needs assessment (sometimes referred to as pre-implementation)
* Tier 2: monitoring and accountability
* Tier 3: quality review and program clarification (sometimes referred to as understanding and refining)
* Tier 4: achieving outcomes
* Tier 5: establishing impact

For each tier, purpose(s) are identified, along with corresponding tasks that enable the identified purpose of the tier to be achieved. For example, the purpose of the first tier, Needs assessment, would be to document a need for a program in a community. The task for that tier would be to assess the community&#x27;s needs and assets by working with all relevant stakeholders.

While the tiers are structured for consecutive use, meaning that information gathered in the earlier tiers is required for tasks on higher tiers, it acknowledges the fluid nature of evaluation. Therefore, it is possible to move from later tiers back to preceding ones, or even to work in two tiers at the same time. It is important for program evaluators to note, however, that a program must be evaluated at the appropriate level.

The five-tiered approach is said to be useful for family support programs which emphasise community and participant empowerment. This is because it encourages a participatory approach involving all stakeholders and it is through this process of reflection that empowerment is achieved.

===Methodological challenges presented by language and culture===
The purpose of this section is to draw attention to some of the methodological challenges and dilemmas evaluators are potentially faced with when conducting a program evaluation in a developing country. In many developing countries the major sponsors of evaluation are donor agencies from the developed world, and these agencies require regular evaluation reports in order to maintain accountability and control of resources, as well as generate evidence for the program&#x27;s success or failure. However, there are many hurdles and challenges which evaluators face when attempting to implement an evaluation program which attempts to make use of techniques and systems which are not developed within the context to which they are applied. Some of the issues include differences in culture, attitudes, language and political process.

Culture is defined by Ebbutt (1998, p. 416) as a &quot;constellation of both written and unwritten expectations, values, norms, rules, laws, artifacts, rituals and behaviors that permeate a society and influence how people behave socially&quot;. Culture can influence many facets of the evaluation process, including data collection, evaluation program implementation and the analysis and understanding of the results of the evaluation. In particular, instruments which are traditionally used to collect data such as questionnaires and semi-structured interviews need to be sensitive to differences in culture, if they were originally developed in a different cultural context. The understanding and meaning of constructs which the evaluator is attempting to measure may not be shared between the evaluator and the sample population and thus the transference of concepts is an important notion, as this will influence the quality of the data collection carried out by evaluators as well as the analysis and results generated by the data.

Language also plays an important part in the evaluation process, as language is tied closely to culture. Language can be a major barrier to communicating concepts which the evaluator is trying to access, and translation is often required. There are a multitude of problems with translation, including the loss of meaning as well as the exaggeration or enhancement of meaning by translators. For example, terms which are contextually specific may not translate into another language with the same weight or meaning. In particular, data collection instruments need to take meaning into account as the subject matter may not be considered sensitive in a particular context might prove to be sensitive in the context in which the evaluation is taking place. Thus, evaluators need to take into account two important concepts when administering data collection tools: lexical equivalence and conceptual equivalence. Lexical equivalence asks the question: how does one phrase a question in two languages using the same words? This is a difficult task to accomplish, and uses of techniques such as back-translation may aid the evaluator but may not result in perfect transference of meaning. This leads to the next point, conceptual equivalence. It is not a common occurrence for concepts to transfer unambiguously from one culture to another. Data collection instruments which have not undergone adequate testing and piloting may therefore render results which are not useful as the concepts which are measured by the instrument may have taken on a different meaning and thus rendered the instrument unreliable and invalid.

Thus, it can be seen that evaluators need to take into account the methodological challenges created by differences in culture and language when attempting to conduct a program evaluation in a developing country.

==Utilization results==
There are three conventional uses of evaluation results: persuasive utilization, direct (instrumental) utilization, and conceptual utilization.

===Persuasive utilization===
Persuasive utilization is the enlistment of evaluation results in an effort to persuade an audience to either support an agenda or to oppose it. Unless the &#x27;persuader&#x27; is the same person that ran the evaluation, this form of utilization is not of much interest to evaluators as they often cannot foresee possible future efforts of persuasion.

===Direct (instrumental) utilization===
Evaluators often tailor their evaluations to produce results that can have a direct influence in the improvement of the structure, or on the process, of a program. For example, the evaluation of a novel educational intervention may produce results that indicate no improvement in students&#x27; marks. This may be due to the intervention not having a sound theoretical background, or it may be that the intervention is not conducted as originally intended. The results of the evaluation would hopefully cause to the creators of the intervention to go back to the drawing board to re-create the core structure of the intervention, or even change the implementation processes.

===Conceptual utilization===
But even if evaluation results do not have a direct influence in the re-shaping of a program, they may still be used to make people aware of the issues the program is trying to address. Going back to the example of an evaluation of a novel educational intervention, the results can also be used to inform educators and students about the different barriers that may influence students&#x27; learning difficulties. A number of studies on these barriers may then be initiated by this new information.

===Variables affecting utilization===
There are five conditions that seem to affect the utility of evaluation results, namely &quot;relevance&quot;, &quot;communication between the evaluators and the users of the results&quot;, &quot;information processing by the users&quot;, &quot;the plausibility of the results&quot;, as well as &quot;the level of involvement or advocacy of the users&quot;.

===Guidelines for maximizing utilization===
Quoted directly from Rossi et al. (2004, p. 416).:
* Evaluators must understand the cognitive styles of decisionmakers
* Evaluation results must be timely and available when needed
* Evaluations must respect stakeholders&#x27; program commitments
* Utilization and dissemination plans should be part of the evaluation design
* Evaluations should include an assessment of utilization

==Internal versus external program evaluators==

The choice of the evaluator chosen to evaluate the program may be regarded as equally important as the process of the evaluation. Evaluators may be internal (persons associated with the program to be executed) or external (Persons not associated with any part of the execution/implementation of the program). (Division for oversight services,2004). The following provides a brief summary of the advantages and disadvantages of internal and external evaluators adapted from the Division of oversight services (2004), for a more comprehensive list of advantages and disadvantages of internal and external evaluators, see (Division of oversight services, 2004).

===Internal evaluators===
Advantages
*May have better overall knowledge of the program and possess informal knowledge of the program
*Less threatening as already familiar with staff
*Less costly

Disadvantages
*May be less objective
*May be more preoccupied with other activities of the program and not give the evaluation complete attention
*May not be adequately trained as an evaluator.

===External evaluators===
Advantages
* More objective of the process, offers new perspectives, different angles to observe and critique the process
* May be able to dedicate greater amount of time and attention to the evaluation
* May have greater expertise and evaluation brain
Disadvantages
* May be more costly and require more time for the contract, monitoring, negotiations etc.
* May be unfamiliar with program staff and create anxiety about being evaluated
* May be unfamiliar with organization policies, certain constraints affecting the program.

==Three paradigms==

===Positivist===
Potter (2006) identifies and describes three broad paradigms within program evaluation . The first, and probably most common, is the positivist approach, in which evaluation can only occur where there are &quot;objective&quot;, observable and measurable aspects of a program, requiring predominantly quantitative evidence. The positivist approach includes evaluation dimensions such as needs assessment, assessment of program theory, assessment of program process, impact assessment and efficiency assessment (Rossi, Lipsey and Freeman, 2004).
A detailed example of the positivist approach is a study conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California report titled &quot;Evaluating Academic Programs in California&#x27;s Community Colleges&quot;, in which the evaluators examine measurable activities (i.e. enrollment data) and conduct quantitive assessments like factor analysis.

===Interpretive===
The second paradigm identified by Potter (2006) is that of interpretive approaches, where it is argued that it is essential that the evaluator develops an understanding of the perspective, experiences and expectations of all stakeholders. This would lead to a better understanding of the various meanings and needs held by stakeholders, which is crucial before one is able to make judgments about the merit or value of a program. The evaluator&#x27;s contact with the program is often over an extended period of time and, although there is no standardized method, observation, interviews and focus groups are commonly used.
A report commissioned by the World Bank details 8 approaches in which qualitative and quantitative methods can be integrated and perhaps yield insights not achievable through only one method.

===Critical-emancipatory===
Potter (2006) also identifies critical-emancipatory approaches to program evaluation, which are largely based on action research for the purposes of social transformation. This type of approach is much more ideological and often includes a greater degree of social activism on the part of the evaluator. This approach would be appropriate for qualitative and participative evaluations. Because of its critical focus on societal power structures and its emphasis on participation and empowerment, Potter argues this type of evaluation can be particularly useful in developing countries.

Despite the paradigm which is used in any program evaluation, whether it be positivist, interpretive or critical-emancipatory, it is essential to acknowledge that evaluation takes place in specific socio-political contexts. Evaluation does not exist in a vacuum and all evaluations, whether they are aware of it or not, are influenced by socio-political factors. It is important to recognize the evaluations and the findings which result from this kind of evaluation process can be used in favour or against particular ideological, social and political agendas (Weiss, 1999). This is especially true in an age when resources are limited and there is competition between organizations for certain projects to be prioritised over others (Louw, 1999).

==Empowerment evaluation==

Empowerment evaluation makes use of evaluation concepts, techniques, and findings to foster improvement and self-determination of a particular program aimed at a specific target population/program participants. Empowerment evaluation is value oriented towards getting program participants involved in bringing about change in the programs they are targeted for. One of the main focuses in empowerment evaluation is to incorporate the program participants in the conducting of the evaluation process. This process is then often followed by some sort of critical reflection of the program. In such cases, an external/outsider evaluator serves as a consultant/coach/facilitator to the program participants and seeks to understand the program from the perspective of the participants. Once a clear understanding of the participants perspective has been gained appropriate steps and strategies can be devised (with the valuable input of the participants) and implemented in order to reach desired outcomes.

According to Fetterman (2002) empowerment evaluation has three steps;
*Establishing a mission
*Taking stock
*Planning for the future

===Establishing a mission===
The first step involves evaluators asking the program participants and staff members (of the program) to define the mission of the program. Evaluators may opt to carry this step out by bringing such parties together and asking them to generate and discuss the mission of the program. The logic behind this approach is to show each party that there may be divergent views of what the program mission actually is.

===Taking stock===
Taking stock as the second step consists of two important tasks. The first task is concerned with program participants and program staff generating a list of current key activities that are crucial to the functioning of the program. The second task is concerned with rating the identified key activities, also known as &quot;prioritization&quot;. For example, each party member may be asked to rate each key activity on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important and 1 the least important. The role of the evaluator during this task is to facilitate interactive discussion amongst members in an attempt to establish some baseline of shared meaning and understanding pertaining to the key activities. In addition, relevant documentation (such as financial reports and curriculum information) may be brought into the discussion when considering some of the key activities.

===Planning for the future===
After prioritizing the key activities the next step is to plan for the future. Here the evaluator asks program participants and program staff how they would like to improve the program in relation to the key activities listed. The objective is to create a thread of coherence whereby the mission generated (step 1) guides the stock take (step 2) which forms the basis for the plans for the future (step 3). Thus, in planning for the future specific goals are aligned with relevant key activities. In addition to this it is also important for program participants and program staff to identify possible forms of evidence (measurable indicators) which can be used to monitor progress towards specific goals. Goals must be related to the program&#x27;s activities, talents, resources and scope of capability- in short the goals formulated must be realistic.

These three steps of empowerment evaluation produce the potential for a program to run more effectively and more in touch with the needs of the target population. Empowerment evaluation as a process which is facilitated by a skilled evaluator equips as well as empowers participants by providing them with a &#x27;new&#x27; way of critically thinking and reflecting on programs. Furthermore, it empowers program participants and staff to recognize their own capacity to bring about program change through collective action.

==Transformative paradigm==
The transformative paradigm is integral in incorporating social justice in evaluation. Donna Mertens, primary researcher in this field, states that the transformative paradigm, &quot;focuses primarily on viewpoints of marginalized groups and interrogating systemic power structures through mixed methods to further social justice and human rights&quot;. The transformative paradigm arose after marginalized groups, who have historically been pushed to the side in evaluation, began to collaborate with scholars to advocate for social justice and human rights in evaluation. The transformative paradigm introduces many different paradigms and lenses to the evaluation process, leading it to continually call into question the evaluation process.

Both the American Evaluation Association and National Association of Social Workers call attention to the ethical duty to possess cultural competence when conducting evaluations. Cultural competence in evaluation can be broadly defined as a systemic, response inquiry that is actively cognizant, understanding, and appreciative of the cultural context in which the evaluation takes place; that frames and articulates epistemology of the evaluation endeavor; that employs culturally and contextually appropriate methodology; and that uses stakeholder-generated, interpretive means to arrive at the results and further use of the findings. Many health and evaluation leaders are careful to point out that cultural competence cannot be determined by a simple checklist, but rather it is an attribute that develops over time. The root of cultural competency in evaluation is a genuine respect for communities being studied and openness to seek depth in understanding different cultural contexts, practices and paradigms of thinking. This includes being creative and flexible to capture different cultural contexts, and heightened awareness of power differentials that exist in an evaluation context. Important skills include: ability to build rapport across difference, gain the trust of the community members, and self-reflect and recognize one&#x27;s own biases.

===Paradigms===
The paradigms axiology, ontology, epistemology, and methodology are reflective of social justice practice in evaluation. These examples focus on addressing inequalities and injustices in society by promoting inclusion and equality in human rights.

====Axiology (Values and Value Judgements)====
The transformative paradigm&#x27;s axiological assumption rests on four primary principles:
* The importance of being culturally respectful
* The promotion of social justice
* The furtherance of human rights
* Addressing inequities

====Ontology (Reality)====
Differences in perspectives on what is real are determined by diverse values and life experiences. In turn these values and life experiences are often associated with differences in access to privilege, based on such characteristics as disability, gender, sexual identity, religion, race/ethnicity, national origins, political party, income level, age, language, and immigration or refugee status.

====Epistemology (Knowledge)====
Knowledge is constructed within the context of power and privilege with consequences attached to which version of knowledge is given privilege. &quot;Knowledge is socially and historically located within a complex cultural context&quot;.

====Methodology (Systematic Inquiry)====
Methodological decisions are aimed at determining the approach that will best facilitate use of the process and findings to enhance social justice; identify the systemic forces that support the status quo and those that will allow change to happen; and acknowledge the need for a critical and reflexive relationship between the evaluator and the stakeholders.

===Lenses===
While operating through social justice, it is imperative to be able to view the world through the lens of those who experience injustices. Critical Race Theory, Feminist Theory, and Queer/LGBTQ Theory are frameworks for how we think others should think about providing justice for marginalized groups. These lenses create opportunity to make each theory priority in addressing inequality.

====Critical Race Theory====
Critical Race Theory(CRT)is an extension of critical theory that is focused in inequities based on race and ethnicity. Daniel Solorzano describes the role of CRT as providing a framework to investigate and make visible those systemic aspects of society that allow the discriminatory and oppressive status quo of racism to continue.

====Feminist theory====
The essence of feminist theories is to &quot;expose the individual and institutional practices that have denied access to women and other oppressed groups and have ignored or devalued women&quot; 

====Queer/LGBTQ theory====
Queer/LGBTQ theorists question the heterosexist bias that pervades society in terms of power over and discrimination toward sexual orientation minorities. Because of the sensitivity of issues surrounding LGBTQ status, evaluators need to be aware of safe ways to protect such individuals’ identities and ensure that discriminatory practices are brought to light in order to bring about a more just society.

==Government requirements==

Given the Federal budget deficit, the Obama Administration moved to apply an &quot;evidence-based approach&quot; to government spending, including rigorous methods of program evaluation. The President&#x27;s 2011 Budget earmarked funding for 19 government program evaluations for agencies such as the Department of Education and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). An inter-agency group delivers the goal of increasing transparency and accountability by creating effective evaluation networks and drawing on best practices.
A six-step framework for conducting evaluation of public health programs, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), initially increased the emphasis on program evaluation of government programs in the US. The framework is as follows:
# Engage stakeholders
# Describe the program.
# Focus the evaluation.
# Gather credible evidence.
# Justify conclusions.
# Ensure use and share lessons learned.

In January 2019, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act introduced new requirements for federal agencies, such as naming a Chief Evaluation Officer. Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on implementing this law requires agencies to develop a multi-year learning agenda, which has specific questions the agency wants to answer to improve strategic and operational outcomes. Agencies must also complete an annual evaluation plan summarizing the specific evaluations the agency plans to undertake to address the questions in the learning agenda.

==Types of evaluation==
There are many different approaches to program evaluation. Each serves a different purpose. 
* Utilization-Focused Evaluation
* CIPP Model of evaluation
* Formative Evaluation
* Summative Evaluation
* Developmental Evaluation
* Principles-Focused Evaluation
* Theory-Driven Evaluation
* Realist-Driven Evaluation

==CIPP Model of evaluation==
===History of the CIPP model===
The CIPP model of evaluation was developed by Daniel Stufflebeam and colleagues in the 1960s.CIPP is an acronym for Context, Input, Process and Product. CIPP is an evaluation model that requires the evaluation of context, input, process and product in judging a programme&#x27;s value. CIPP is a decision-focused approach to evaluation and emphasises the systematic provision of information for programme management and operation.

===CIPP model===
The CIPP framework was developed as a means of linking evaluation with programme decision-making. It aims to provide an analytic and rational basis for programme decision-making, based on a cycle of planning, structuring, implementing and reviewing and revising decisions, each examined through a different aspect of evaluation –context, input, process and product evaluation.

The CIPP model is an attempt to make evaluation directly relevant to the needs of decision-makers during the phases and activities of a programme. Stufflebeam&#x27;s context, input, process, and product (CIPP) evaluation model is recommended as a framework to systematically guide the conception, design, implementation, and assessment of service-learning projects, and provide feedback and judgment of the project&#x27;s effectiveness for continuous improvement.

===Four aspects of CIPP evaluation===
These aspects are context, inputs, process, and product. These four aspects of CIPP evaluation assist a decision-maker to answer four basic questions:
*What should we do?
This involves collecting and analysing needs assessment data to determine goals, priorities and objectives. For example, a context evaluation of a literacy program might involve an analysis of the existing objectives of the literacy programme, literacy achievement test scores, staff concerns (general and particular), literacy policies and plans and community concerns, perceptions or attitudes and needs.
*How should we do it?
This involves the steps and resources needed to meet the new goals and objectives and might include identifying successful external programs and materials as well as gathering information.
*Are we doing it as planned?
This provides decision-makers with information about how well the programme is being implemented. By continuously monitoring the program, decision-makers learn such things as how well it is following the plans and guidelines, conflicts arising, staff support and morale, strengths and weaknesses of materials, delivery and budgeting problems.
*Did the programme work?
By measuring the actual outcomes and comparing them to the anticipated outcomes, decision-makers are better able to decide if the program should be continued, modified, or dropped altogether. This is the essence of product evaluation.

===Using CIPP in the different stages of the evaluation===
As an evaluation guide, the CIPP model allows evaluators to evaluate the program at different stages, namely: before the program commences by helping evaluators to assess the need and at the end of the program to assess whether or not the program had an effect.

CIPP model allows evaluators to ask formative questions at the beginning of the program, then later supports evaluation the programs impact through asking summative questions on all aspects of the program.
*Context: What needs to be done? Vs. Were important needs addressed?
*Input: How should it be done? Vs. Was a defensible design employed?
*Process: Is it being done? Vs. Was the design well executed?
*Product: Is it succeeding? Vs. Did the effort succeed?

<doc id="619351" wikidata="Q182851" url="?curid=619351" title="Ignitron">
<text>An ignitron is a type of gas-filled tube used as a controlled rectifier and dating from the 1930s. Invented by Joseph Slepian while employed by Westinghouse, Westinghouse was the original manufacturer and owned trademark rights to the name &quot;Ignitron&quot;. Ignitrons are closely related to mercury-arc valves but differ in the way the arc is ignited. They function similarly to thyratrons; a triggering pulse to the igniter electrode turns the device &quot;on&quot;, allowing a high current to flow between the cathode and anode electrodes. After it is turned on, the current through the anode must be reduced to zero to restore the device to its nonconducting state. They are used to switch high currents in heavy industrial applications.

==Construction and operation==

An ignitron is usually a large steel container with a pool of mercury in the bottom that acts as a cathode during operation. A large graphite or refractory metal cylinder, held above the pool by an insulated electrical connection, serves as the anode. An igniting electrode (called the &quot;ignitor&quot;), made of a refractory semiconductor material such as silicon carbide, is briefly pulsed with a high current to create a puff of electrically conductive mercury plasma. The plasma rapidly bridges the space between the mercury pool and the anode, permitting heavy conduction between the main electrodes. At the surface of the mercury, heating by the resulting arc liberates large numbers of electrons which help to maintain the mercury arc. The mercury surface thus serves as the cathode, and current is normally only in one direction. Once ignited, an ignitron will continue to pass current until either the current is externally interrupted or the voltage applied between cathode and anode is reversed.

==Applications==
Ignitrons were long used as high-current rectifiers in major industrial and utility installations where thousands of amperes of AC must be converted to DC, such as aluminum smelters. Ignitrons were used to control the current in electric welding machines. Large electric motors were also controlled by ignitrons used in gated fashion, in a manner similar to modern semiconductor devices such as silicon controlled rectifiers and triacs. Many electric locomotives used them in conjunction with transformers to convert high voltage AC from the overhead lines to relatively low voltage DC for the traction motors. The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s E44 freight locomotives carried on-board ignitrons, as did the Russian ВЛ-60 freight locomotive. For many modern applications, ignitrons have been replaced by solid state alternatives.

Because they are far more resistant to damage due to overcurrent or back-voltage, ignitrons are still manufactured and used in preference to semiconductors in some installations. For example, specially constructed &quot;pulse rated&quot; ignitrons are still used in certain pulsed power applications. These devices can switch hundreds of kiloamperes and hold off as much as 50 kV. The anodes in these devices are often fabricated from a refractory metal, usually molybdenum, to handle reverse current during ringing (or oscillatory) discharges without damage. Pulse rated ignitrons usually operate at very low duty cycles. They are often used to switch high energy capacitor banks during electromagnetic forming, electrohydraulic forming, or for emergency short-circuiting of high voltage power sources (&quot;crowbar&quot; switching).
==Comparison with mercury-arc valve==
Although the basic principles of how the arc is formed, along with many aspects of construction, are very similar to other types of mercury-arc valves, ignitrons differ from other mercury-arc valves in that the arc is ignited each time a conduction cycle is started, and then extinguished when the current falls below a critical threshold.

In other types of mercury-arc valve, the arc is ignited just once when the valve is first energised, and thereafter remains permanently established, alternating between the main anode(s) and a low-power &quot;auxiliary anode&quot; or &quot;keep-alive circuit&quot;. Moreover, control grids are required in order to adjust the timing of the start of conduction.

The action of igniting the arc at a controlled time, each cycle, allows the ignitron to dispense with the auxiliary anode and control grids required by other mercury-arc valves. However, a disadvantage is that the ignition electrode must be positioned very accurately, just barely touching the surface of the mercury pool, which means that ignitrons must be installed very accurately within a few degrees of an upright position.

<doc id="619354" wikidata="Q1849593" url="?curid=619354" title="Skis Rossignol">
<text>Skis Rossignol S.A., or simply Rossignol, is a French manufacturer of alpine, snowboard, and Nordic equipment, as well as related outerwear and accessories, located in Isère, France. Rossignol was one of the first companies to produce plastic skis. The company also owns the brands Dynastar and LOOK. In 2005, Rossignol was bought by boardsport equipment manufacturer Quiksilver for $560 million. In 2008, Quiksilver made a deal to sell Rossignol for $147 million to a former chief executive, Bruno Cercley.

In July 2013, Macquarie sold the Rossignol Group, along with its subsidiaries Lange and Dynastar, to a partnership of Altor Equity Partners (a Swedish investment group) and the Boix-Vives family.

==History==

The company was founded in 1907 by Abel Rossignol, who manufactured wood products (such as spindles) for the textile industry. Rossignol, a committed skier, used his carpentry skills to make a pair of skis out of solid wood. In 1937, Émile Allais of France became triple world champion on Rossignol Olympic 41 skis.

When Laurent Boix-Vives bought the company in 1956, the company only focused on skiing equipment and began to sell them worldwide. Rossignol had a breakthrough during the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, United States, when Jean Vuarnet of France won the downhill on Allais 60s, the company&#x27;s first all-metal skis.

In 1964, Rossignol released the Strato, its first fiberglass ski.

In the 1970s, Rossignol set up a distribution company in the U.S., launching its first Nordic skis, and soon became the world&#x27;s largest ski manufacturer. At the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Rossignol triumphed, winning six out of 10 gold medals in alpine events.

In 1990, Rossignol acquired the Caber boot factory in Italy and rebranded the product under the Rossignol label (Rossignol already controlled the Lange ski boot brand). The company also acquired the Geze and Look ski-bindings ranges, rebranding Geze. It soon moved into snowboards and mountain clothing.

Athletes using Rossignol products won at both the Winter Olympic games in Albertville and in Lillehammer.

In 2006, Huntington Beach, CA based Quiksilver acquired Rossignol only to sell the entity back in 2008. The debt incurred ultimately resulted in Quiksilver&#x27;s bankruptcy.

Alberto Tomba of Italy, the dominant technical skier of the late 1980s and 1990s, raced on Rossignol skis.

Rossignol is the French word for nightingale.

<text>Orthodontic retainers are custom-made devices, usually made of wires or clear plastic, that hold teeth in position after surgery or any method of realigning teeth. Once a phase of orthodontic treatment has been completed to straighten teeth, there remains a lifelong risk of relapse (a tendency for teeth to return to their original position) due to a number of factors: recoil of periodontal fibres, pressure from surrounding soft tissues, the occlusion and patient’s continued growth and development. By using retainers to hold the teeth in their new position for a length of time, the surrounding periodontal fibres adapt to changes in the bone which can help minimize any changes to the final tooth position after the completion of orthodontic treatment. Retainers may also be used to treat overjets.

== Removable retainers ==
Removable retainers include Hawley, Vacuum-formed, Begg and Barrer. They provide orthodontic retention when worn and they can be taken in and out of the mouth. They can be worn part-time or full-time if required or as advised by the orthodontist. In comparison to fixed retainers, removable retainers are easier to clean.

=== Hawley retainers ===
The best-known removable retainers are the Hawley retainers, which consist of a metal wires that typically surround the six anterior teeth and keep them in place. Hawley retainers are one of the oldest types of removable retainers. Named for its inventor, Dr. Charles A. Hawley, the labial wire, or Hawley bow, incorporates 2 omega loops for adjustment. It is anchored in an acrylic baseplate that sits in the palate (roof of the mouth). They are made from metal wire running along the outside of the teeth. There are many adaptations possible with Hawley retainers. The advantage of this type of retainer is that the metal wires can be adjusted to finish treatment and continue minor movement of the anterior teeth as needed. It also benefits from being robust and rigid, easy to construct and allows prosthetic tooth/teeth to be added onto with metal stops placed mesial and distal to the prosthetic teeth to prevent any relapse. To help fix rotations; acrylic facing can be added to the labial bow and a bite plane added to maintain the result of deep overbite correction. Also, to control the position of the canine, reverse U-loop can be employed. Additionally, to avoid occlusal interferences, the labial bow can be soldered to the cribs.

The main disadvantages of this type of retainer is its inferior aesthetics, interference with speech, risk of fracture and inferior retention of lower incisors in comparison to vacuum-formed retainers.

Recently, a more aesthetic version of the Hawley retainer has been developed. For this alternative, the front metal wire is replaced with a clear wire called the ASTICS. This retainer is intended to be adjustable similarly to the traditional Hawley retainer, which is not practical with vacuum-formed retainers.

Research shows that Hawley retainers are not effective for preventing incisor irregularity relapse. Hawley retainers also affect speech, especially the d, s, t, and i sounds, however as they are often only worn at night time, this concern may not be so prevalent. Research shows that participants that wear Hawley retainers report being more embarrassed about the appliance than wearing vacuum formed retainers and they found Hawley retainers more difficult to wear. However, if the patient has concerns with regards to the visible metal wire, a clear polyethylene bow can be used to enhance aesthetics.

The process of making an acrylic retainer was featured on the How It&#x27;s Made TV show on the Science Channel on Season 23, Episode 16.

=== Vacuum-formed retainers ===
Another common type of removable retainer is the vacuum formed retainer (VFR). This is a polypropylene or polyvinylchloride (PVC) material. VFRs are made using a thermoforming process, using vacuum- or pressure-thermoforming. This clear or transparent retainer normally fits over the entire arch of teeth, however some designs fit only from canine to canine (clip-on retainer). The retainer is clear and so virtually invisible when worn. Hence, it can offer an aesthetic advantage relative to other retainers. VFRs, if worn 24 hours per day, do not allow the upper and lower teeth to touch, as the retainers cover the occlusal (biting) surfaces of the teeth. Some orthodontists feel that it is important for the top and bottom chewing surfaces to meet to allow for &quot;favourable settling&quot; to occur, thus the need for wearing the retainer only intermittently. VFRs are most commonly worn overnight and removed while eating. If worn while eating, they can behave as a reservoir enclosing the teeth with cariogenic substances and lead to decalcification of teeth over time (formation of cavities). The same can result if the retainer is inserted straight after a meal or drink. VFRs tend to be favoured as an orthodontic retainer as they are more aesthetic, interfere less with speech and are more economical than other removable retainers. However, for patients with disorders such as bruxism, VFRs can be prone to rapid breakage and deterioration due to grinding of the VFR against the opposing teeth. There is, however, an increased ease of fabrication over other retainers if they do break. Another advantage of VFRs is that there is evidence to suggest superior retention of lower incisors compared to other removable retainer types, but the best retention was achieved with fixed retainers.

=== Begg retainers ===
The Begg retainers have the labial bow extending around the distal aspect of the terminal molar. They allow occlusal settling, as no wire work crosses the occlusion. Begg retainers are robust enough to be worn during eating, however they are more retentive than Hawley retainers and the labial bow is less prone to distortion.

=== Barrer retainers ===
The Barrer retainers (aka Spring retainers) carry acrylic bows both labially and lingually. The original appliance extended only to the canines, however due to the risk of swallowing or aspiration, a modification which includes cribs on the first molars has been described. These retainers can be used to realign minor lower incisor relapse.

=== SMART retainers ===
Dental practitioners and orthodontists are sometimes resistant to providing younger patients with removable retainers due to the potential issues of the patient not wearing their retainer consistently after completing their orthodontic treatment. However, the recent innovation of SMART Retainers and related mobile applications that track, remind, and reward the patients for their continued use of their retainer may lead to a significant decrease in the number of adolescents that obtain additional orthodontic treatment in the future due to them not complying with their retainer usage. The mobile application has a unique feature that allows for parental notifications. If the child does not open their Smart Retainer Case, the parent can receive mobile notifications to help reduce retainer non-compliance.

== Fixed retainers ==
Fixed retainers are often used to provide orthodontic retention and avoid relapse. They commonly consist of a wire bonded with acid etch and composite to the lingual/palatal surface of the anterior teeth. In fixed retainers, composite is usually placed to bond and to cover the wire, whilst ensuring no interference in the interdental space. Fixed retainers are used in situations where instability is more likely, such as severe rotations, periodontal disease and median diastemas. Occasionally the patient will require a removable retainer as well. Fixed bonded retainers can be designed with a smooth wire or flexible spiral wire which is also known as multi-strand wire. The most commonly used are multi-strand wire bonded to all six anterior teeth or a round stainless steel wire bonded to the canines only. Although fixed retainers depend less on the patient’s cooperation for regular wearing, they are more difficult to clean and therefore need more attention from the patient to prevent plaque accumulation and subsequent gingival inflammation.

== Maintenance ==
Relapse can occur if retainers are not worn regularly post-treatment. The orthodontist may advise wearing the retainer for a set period of time or indefinitely after orthodontic treatment. Recent innovations of a Smart Retainer Case that utilizes: IoT, motion sensors, and a mobile application to track, remind, and reward patients, might be the most effective way of keeping post-orthodontic patients engaged with their final retention and continued wear of their removable retainer. If not cleaned properly, retainers can act as a food reservoir and lead to caries and gingival inflammation. Cleaning options for removable retainers include retainer/denture tablets, the use of a toothbrush and fragrance-free soap or non-abrasive toothpaste. If the water used to clean the retainer is too hot, it may cause shrinkage.

If the retainer is removable, it should be cleaned before inserting. If the retainer is fixed and cannot be removed, it should be cleaned during the nighttime home care routine. To clean a retainer use a wet toothbrush and gently scrub all surfaces of the retainer to remove any plaque and bacteria. A non-abrasive toothpaste should be used when cleaning a retainer. Alternatively, a mild soap or a brush dipped in mouthwash can also be used to clean it. When not in use keep the retainer in a dry container. Avoid leaving it in high temperatures or in the sun. Do not soak a retainer in liquids overnight. This will ensure the material will stay intact.

<doc id="619356" wikidata="Q495609" url="?curid=619356" title="Mackenzie Basin">
<text>The Mackenzie Basin (), popularly and traditionally known as the Mackenzie Country, is an elliptical intermontane basin located in the Mackenzie and Waitaki Districts, near the centre of the South Island of New Zealand. It is the largest such basin in New Zealand. Historically famous mainly for sheep farming, the sparsely populated area is now also a popular tourism destination.

The basin was named in the 1850s by and after James Mckenzie, a shepherd and would-be farmer of Scottish origin. Mckenzie was captured for allegedly stealing sheep; he herded his flocks in what was then an area almost totally empty of any human habitation, though Māori previously lived there intermittently. After his capture, the area was soon divided up amongst new sheep pasture stations in 1857.

==Geography==


The basin extends approximately north to south, and east to west. The Southern Alps constitute its western edge. The Mackenzie Basin is located entirely within South Canterbury.

Using State Highway 8, it can be accessed via Burkes Pass (elevation 709m / 2,326 ft) from the north and the Lindis Pass (elevation 965m / 3,166 ft) from the south, or via State Highway 83 through the Waitaki Valley from the east. Aside from these passes, the terrain is generally highest at the northern end and gradually descends in a southward direction.

The basin is drained by the Waitaki River. Prominent rivers crossing the Mackenzie Basin include the Ahuriri, the Hakataramea and the Tekapo Rivers. Lakes Ōhau, Pukaki, Alexandrina and Tekapo lie within the Mackenzie Basin, as do the artificial hydroelectric lakes of Ruataniwha, Benmore and Aviemore.

==Settlement and activities==

Sparsely populated, and with only four settlements (Lake Tekapo, population &lt;500; Mount Cook Village, population &lt;150; Twizel, population &lt;1,000; and Omarama, population &lt;400), the Mackenzie Country comprises an area of huge glacial lakes and snow-capped mountains, particularly favoured by tourists and skiers.

The Ōhau skifield near Omarama, and Roundhill and Mount Dobson Ski Areas at Lake Tekapo, are small commercial skifields popular amongst many living in Canterbury and Otago.

The Mackenzie Country is frequently utilised as the principal and second-unit location for television commercials, documentaries, and motion pictures, including much of Peter Jackson&#x27;s epic &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film trilogy.

Gliding is another common activity within the Mackenzie Basin, and the area was host to a Gliding World Cup event in 1995, as well as being the home of several gliding clubs, airfields, and numerous private glider pilots, of both amateur and professional status.

== International Dark Sky Reserve ==

Due to its clean, dry and dark sky, the Mackenzie Basin serves as an important area for New Zealand-based astronomy, with a number of related facilities located there, including the nation&#x27;s premier astronomical observatory, the University of Canterbury&#x27;s Mount John University Observatory, and several amateur observatories. Astronomy-related tourism is an increasing contributor to the area&#x27;s economy, with more astro-tourism ventures in development near Lake Tekapo, Mount Cook village (planetarium) and Omarama. Each June the annual mid winter star party is held at new moon on the Omarama airfield.

In June 2012, an area of 430,000 hectares (1,100,000 acres) including Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park and the Mackenzie Basin was declared the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve by the International Dark-Sky Association. At the time of the designation in 2012, the reserve was the largest in the world, and the only reserve of its type in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Demographics==

The statistical area of Mackenzie Lakes corresponds to the portion of the Mackenzie Basin within the Mackenzie District. It includes Mt Cook Village and Lake Tekapo, but not Twizel. Mackenzie Lakes covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, Mackenzie Lakes had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Mackenzie Lakes had a population of 1,182 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 300 people (34.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 399 people (51.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 375 households, comprising 585 males and 597 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female. The median age was 31.8 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 156 people (13.2%) aged under 15 years, 357 (30.2%) aged 15 to 29, 567 (48.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 102 (8.6%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 71.6% European/Pākehā, 4.3% Māori, 2.0% Pasifika, 20.1% Asian, and 7.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 43.4, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 55.6% had no religion, 31.0% were Christian, 1.8% were Hindu, 1.0% were Muslim, 2.8% were Buddhist and 2.3% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 279 (27.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 81 (7.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $36,500, compared with $31,800 nationally. 141 people (13.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 780 (76.0%) people were employed full-time, 117 (11.4%) were part-time, and 3 (0.3%) were unemployed.

==Environmental issues==
The original vegetation cover prior to human settlement has been completely transformed in the basin and indeed most of the surrounding Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands ecoregion, initially due to fires lit by Māori and European settlers, and in more recent times by farming activity and by pests. 

The extensive network of canals for hydroelectric schemes posed a threat to the black stilt (or kakī), an endangered river wading bird. A captive breeding programme was set up and it is administered by the Department of Conservation.

The Mackenzie Basin is one of the areas where wilding conifers proliferate. These weed trees cover large areas sometimes to a very high density and therefore excluding native vegetation and reducing the amount of available pasture. Some areas have control measures in place to prevent the trees from spreading.

Rabbits are a common invasive species in the area affect both agricultural production and biodiversity. Rabbit numbers dropped after the introduction of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RCD) but are now increasing. The Department of Conservation has plans to drop sodium fluoroacetate (1080) laced poison bait to control the rabbit numbers. This is seen as necessary due to the disproportionally high number of threatened plant species in the Mackenzie Basin. The plan attracted opposition at submission hearings.

There is currently a high demand for water to irrigate the Mackenzie Basin, with 126 resource consents from 36 applicants before Environment Canterbury as of mid-2009. The water would be used to irrigate an area of , but the schemes are opposed by many locals and the Department of Conservation for the potential ecological effects, and since it may clash with a proposed Mackenzie Basin Drylands Park.

<text>A food taster is a person who ingests food that was prepared for someone else, to confirm it is safe to eat. One who tests drinks in this way is known as a cupbearer. The person to whom the food is to be served is usually an important person, such as a monarch or somebody under threat of assassination or harm.

==Role==
Food tasters have several functions:
* The safety of the food may be determined by observing whether or not the food taster subsequently becomes ill. However, food tasting is not effective against slow-acting poisons that take a long time to produce visible symptoms.
* The food taster may also prepare and serve food, so they can be even more diligent in preventing someone from poisoning the food.
* In the event the target falls ill or dies, the similar illness or death of the taster provides evidence of deliberate poisoning.

==Examples==
In ancient Rome, the duty was often given to a slave (termed the &quot;praegustator&quot;). Roman Emperor Claudius was allegedly killed by poison in AD 54, even though he had a food taster named Halotus. Tasters were sometimes coerced. Over history, presidents and royal families have hired food tasters or sacrifices, over fear of being poisoned. Queen Durdhara, the Mauryan empress, ate food that was prepared for her husband and died.

Adolf Hitler&#x27;s food taster Margot Wölk tried the food at 8:00 am every day, and, if she did not fall ill, the food would be sent to Hitler&#x27;s military headquarters. President Vladimir Putin has hired a food taster who is part of his security staff to protect himself as well. In recent times, animals such as mice have been used to detect impurities in food produced for humans, such as during the 2008 Olympic Games in China. In the United States, a number of recent presidents, including Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan, have been known to employ food tasters.

<text>During the Gallipoli campaign in 1915, several battles were fought near the village of Krithia, today Alçıtepe. The village was an objective of the first day of the landing, 25 April 1915. Over the following months, invading British Empire (including the 89th Punjabis of the British Indian Army) and French troops, who had landed near Cape Helles at the end of the peninsula, made several attempts to capture the village. It was never reached; the Ottoman defenders successfully repulsed every assault.

The attacks came to be known as:

<text>Johann Conrad Beissel (March 1, 1691 – July 6, 1768) was a German-born religious leader who in 1732 founded the Ephrata Community in the Province of Pennsylvania.

==Background==
Beissel was born in Eberbach then part of the Holy Roman Empire, and emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1720. Beissel had intended to join a commune of hermits founded there by Johannes Kelpius, but Kelpius had died in 1708. Beissel met with Conrad Matthaei, an associate who became his principal spiritual confidant. The group around Kelpius had arrived in 1694. They settled on a ridge above the Wissahickon Creek. There they prayed, meditated, and watched the stars looking for signs of the coming kingdom of Christ. They also taught children of the community. Some were celibate until death; others married.

In 1732 Beissel established a semi-monastic Baptist community called the Camp of the Solitary, with a convent (the Sister House) and a monastery (the Brother House) at Ephrata, in what is now Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Celibacy was considered a virtue, but not obligatory. Each member adopted a new name, and Beissel was called Friedsam, to which the community afterward added the title of Gottrecht. Believing families settled near the community, accepted Beissel as their spiritual leader, and worshipped with the community on the Sabbath. They were influenced by Schwarzenau Brethren thought.
Beissel served as the community&#x27;s composer as well as its spiritual leader. He devised his own system of musical composition intended to simplify the process by relying on pre-determined sequences of &quot;master notes&quot; and &quot;servant notes&quot; to create harmony. This was mentioned in Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; as a precursor to serialism.

Beissel&#x27;s colony was noted for its printing facilities. After Beissel&#x27;s death and the disruption of the war years of the American Revolution, the utopian community declined in population. Failing to attract sufficient members, its people assimilated into the general Baptist community.

==Veganism==
Beissel was one of the first vegetarians in North America who was motivated by Christian religious belief. The entire Ephrata community reportedly abstained from meat eating, which Beissel considered spiritually undesirable.

Beissel invented a vegan diet for the Ephrata community that excluded all meat, dairy, eggs and honey. His diet consisted of buckwheat, cabbage, fruit, green vegetables, potatoes and wheat.

<doc id="619368" wikidata="Q73580" url="?curid=619368" title="Darkness at Noon">
<text>Darkness at Noon (, ) is a novel by Austrian-Hungarian-born novelist Arthur Koestler, first published in 1940. His best known work, it is the tale of Rubashov, an Old Bolshevik who is arrested, imprisoned, and tried for treason against the government that he helped to create.

The novel is set between 1938 and 1940, after the Great Purge and Moscow show trials. Despite being based on real events, the novel does not name either Russia or the Soviets, and tends to use generic terms to describe people and organizations; for example, the Soviet government is referred to as &quot;the Party&quot; and Nazi Germany is referred to as &quot;the Dictatorship&quot;. Joseph Stalin is represented by &quot;Number One&quot;, a menacing dictator. The novel expresses the author&#x27;s disillusionment with Bolshevism, Stalinism, and the ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the outset of World War II.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; number eight on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century, even though Koestler originally wrote it in German. 

==Background==
Koestler wrote &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; as the second part of a trilogy: the first volume was &quot;The Gladiators&quot; (1939), first published in Hungarian. It was a novel about the subversion of the Spartacus revolt. The third novel was &quot;Arrival and Departure&quot; (1943), about a refugee during World War II. Koestler, who was by then living in London, rewrote that novel in English after the original German version had been lost.

&quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; was commenced in German while Koestler was living in Paris, and, as he describes in the first chapter of Scum of the Earth, completed in the summer of 1939, just outside the village of Belvédère in the Alpes-Maritimes where he was staying with his companion, the sculptor Daphne Hardy, who translated it into English while she was living with him. For decades the German text was thought to have been lost during the escape of Koestler and Hardy from Paris in May 1940, just before the German occupation of France. However, a copy had been sent to Swiss publisher Emil Oprecht. Rupert Hart-Davis, Koestler&#x27;s editor at Jonathan Cape in London had misgivings about the English text but agreed to publish it when a request to Oprecht for his copy went unanswered. At Hart-Davis&#x27; prompting, and unable to reach Koestler, Hardy changed the title from &quot;The Vicious Circle&quot; to &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;. The new title is a reference to Job 5:14: &quot;&quot;They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night&quot;—&quot; a description of the moral dilemmas faced by the book&#x27;s protagonist, as well as Koestler&#x27;s own escape from the Nazis. In August 2015, Oprecht&#x27;s copy was identified in a Zurich library by a doctoral candidate of the University of Kassel. The original German manuscript was published as &quot;Sonnenfinsternis&quot; (&quot;Solar Eclipse&quot;) in May 2018 by Elsinor Verlag. A new professional English translation based on the newfound text was published in 2019.

In his introduction to the 2019 translation, Koestler biographer Michael Scammell wrote that a fresh translation was desirable because Hardy&#x27;s, although &quot;serving the novel well for over seven decades, had difficulties. According to Scammell, &quot;[Hardy] had been forced by circumstances to work in haste, with no dictionaries or other resources available for consultation, which exposed her understandable lack of familiarity with the Soviet and Nazi machinery of totalitarianism. ... The text she worked on was not quite final either. ... It seemed that a fresh and up-to-date translation of the novel would be helpful, preferably by a seasoned translator with the knowledge and experience to clarify the jargon of Marxism–Leninism and present it in terminology that is both accurate and makes sense to an English-speaking reader.&quot; Scammell writes that Philip Boehm &quot;proved the ideal choice for the job&quot;.

In his autobiographical &quot;The Invisible Writing&quot; (1954), Koestler stated that he finished &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; in April 1940, after many troublesome months of 1939, caused mainly by financial difficulties and the later outbreak of World War II. Koestler observed:

Koestler then describes the unfolding of what he calls &#x27;Kafkaesque events&#x27; in his life; spending four months in the concentration camp in the Pyrenees and being released in January 1940, only to be continuously harassed by the police. &quot;During the next three months I finished the novel in the hours snatched between interrogations and searches of my flat, in the constant fear that I would be arrested again and the manuscript of &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; confiscated&quot;. After Hardy mailed her translation to London in May 1940, she fled to London. Meanwhile, Koestler joined the French Foreign Legion, deserted it in North Africa, and made his way to Portugal. Waiting in Lisbon for passage to Great Britain, Koestler heard a false report that the ship taking Hardy to England had been torpedoed and all persons lost (along with his only manuscript); he attempted suicide. He wrote about this incident in &quot;Scum of the Earth&quot; (1941), his memoir of that period. Koestler finally arrived in London, and the book was published there in early 1941.

==Setting==
&quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; is an allegory set in the USSR (not named) during the 1938 purges as Stalin consolidated his dictatorship by eliminating potential rivals within the Communist Party: the military and the professionals. None of this is identified explicitly in the book. Most of the novel occurs within an unnamed prison and in the recollections of the main character, Rubashov. Koestler drew on the experience of being imprisoned by Francisco Franco&#x27;s officials during the Spanish Civil War, which he described in his memoir, &quot;Dialogue with Death&quot;. He was kept in solitary confinement and expected to be executed. He was permitted to walk in the courtyard in the company of other prisoners. Though he was not beaten, he believed that other prisoners were.

==Characters==
The main character is Nikolai Salmanovich Rubashov, a man in his fifties whose character is based on &quot;a number of men who were the victims of the so-called Moscow trials&quot;, several of whom &quot;were personally known to the author&quot;. Rubashov is a stand-in for the Old Bolsheviks as a group, and Koestler uses him to explore their actions at the 1938 Moscow show trials. Secondary characters include some fellow prisoners:
*No. 402 is a Czarist army officer and veteran inmate, with an archaic sense of personal honor, as Rubashov would consider it, .
*&quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, an old revolutionary demoralised and apparently driven to madness by 20 years of solitary confinement and further imprisonment.
*&quot;Harelip&quot; (), who &quot;sends his greetings&quot; to Rubashov, but insists on keeping his name secret.

Two other secondary characters never make a direct appearance but are mentioned frequently:
*Number One (), representing Joseph Stalin, dictator of the USSR. He is depicted in a widely disseminated photograph, a &quot;well-known color print that hung over every bed or sideboard in the country and stared at people with its frozen eyes&quot;.
*Old Bolsheviks. They are represented by an image in his &quot;mind&#x27;s eye, a big photograph in a wooden frame: the delegates to the first congress of the Party&quot;, in which they sat &quot;at a long wooden table, some with their elbows propped on it, others with their hands on their knees, bearded and earnest&quot;.

Rubashov has two interrogators:
*Ivanov, a comrade from the civil war and old friend.
*Gletkin, a young man characterised by starching his uniform so that it &quot;cracks and groans&quot; whenever he moves.

Character described in flashbacks and in the third interrogation:
*Orlova, Rubashov&#x27;s secretary and lover.

==Plot summary==
===Structure===
&quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; is divided into four parts: The First Hearing, The Second Hearing, The Third Hearing, and The Grammatical Fiction. In the original English translation, Koestler&#x27;s word that Hardy translated as &quot;Hearing&quot; was &quot;Verhör&quot;. In the 2019 translation, Boehm translated it as &quot;Interrogation&quot;. In his introduction to that translation, Michael Scammell writes that &quot;hearing&quot; made the Soviet and Nazi &quot;regimes look somewhat softer and more civilized than they really were&quot;.

===The First Hearing===
The line &quot;Nobody can rule guiltlessly&quot;, by Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, appears as the epigraph. The action begins with Rubashov&#x27;s arrest in the middle of the night by two men from the secret police (in the USSR, this would be the NKVD). When they came for Rubashov they woke him from a recurring dream, a replay of the first time he was arrested by the Gestapo. One of the men is about Rubashov&#x27;s age, the other is somewhat younger. The older man is formal and courteous, the younger is brutal.

Imprisoned, Rubashov is at first relieved to be finished with the anxiety of dread during mass arrests. He is expecting to be kept in solitary confinement until he is shot. He begins to communicate with No. 402, the man in the adjacent cell, by using a tap code. Unlike Rubashov, No. 402 is not an intellectual but rather a Tsarist army officer, who hates communists. Their relationship begins on a sour note as No. 402 expresses delight at Rubashov&#x27;s political misfortune; however, No. 402 has non-political urges too, and when he pleads for Rubashov to give him details about the last time he slept with a woman, once Rubashov does so No. 402 warms up to him. The two grow closer over time and exchange information about the prison and its inmates.

Rubashov thinks of the Old Bolsheviks, Number One, and the Marxist interpretation of history. Throughout the novel, Rubashov, Ivanov, and Gletkin speculate about historical processes and how individuals and groups are affected by them. Each hopes that, no matter how vile his actions may seem to their contemporaries, history will eventually absolve them. This is the faith that makes the abuses of the regime tolerable as the men consider the suffering of a few thousand, or a few million people against the happiness of future generations. They believe that gaining the socialist utopia, which they believe is possible, will cause the imposed suffering to be forgiven.

Rubashov meditates on his life. Since joining the Party as a teenager, Rubashov has officered soldiers in the field, won a commendation for &quot;fearlessness&quot;, repeatedly volunteered for hazardous assignments, endured torture, betrayed other communists who deviated from the Party line, and proven that he is loyal to its policies and goals. Recently he has had doubts. Despite 20 years of power, in which the government caused the deliberate deaths and executions of millions, the Party does not seem to be any closer to achieving the goal of a socialist utopia. That vision seems to be receding. Rubashov is in a quandary, between a lifetime of devotion to the Party on the one hand, and his conscience and the increasing evidence of his own experience on the other.

From this point, the narrative switches back and forth between his current life as a political prisoner and his past life as one of the Party elite. He recalls his first visit to Berlin about 1933, after Adolf Hitler gained power. Rubashov was to purge and reorganise the German communists. He met with Richard, a young German communist cell leader who had distributed material contrary to the Party line. In a museum, underneath a picture of the &quot;Pietà,&quot; Rubashov explains to Richard that he has violated Party discipline, become &quot;objectively harmful&quot;, and must be expelled from the Party. A Gestapo man hovers in the background with his girlfriend on his arm. Too late, Richard realises that Rubashov has betrayed him to the secret police. He begs Rubashov not to &quot;throw him to the wolves&quot;, but Rubashov leaves him quickly. Getting into a taxicab, he realises that the taxicab driver is also a communist. The taxicab driver, implied to be a communist, offers to give him free fare, but Rubashov pays the fare. As he travels by train, he dreams that Richard and the taxicab driver are trying to run him over with a train.

This scene introduces the second and third major themes of &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;. The second, suggested repeatedly by the &quot;Pieta&quot; and other Christian imagery, is the contrast between the brutality and modernity of communism on the one hand, and the gentleness, simplicity, and tradition of Christianity. Although Koestler is not suggesting a return to Christian faith, he implies that communism is the worse of the two alternatives. The third theme is the contrast between the trust of the rank and file communists, and the ruthlessness of the Party elite. The rank and file trust and admire men like Rubashov, but the elite betrays and uses them with little thought. As Rubashov confronts the immorality of his actions as a party chief, his abscessed tooth begins to bother him, sometimes reducing him to immobility.

Rubashov recalls being arrested soon after by the Gestapo and imprisoned for two years. Although repeatedly tortured, he never breaks down. After the Nazis finally release him, he returns to his country to a hero&#x27;s welcome. Number One&#x27;s increasing power makes him uncomfortable but he does not act in opposition; he requests a foreign assignment. Number One is suspicious but grants the request. Rubashov is sent to Belgium to enforce Party discipline among the dock workers. After the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, the League of Nations and the Party condemned Italy and imposed an international embargo on strategic resources, especially oil, which the Italians needed. The Belgian dock workers are determined not to allow any shipments for Italy to pass through their port. As his government intends to supply the Italians with oil and other resources secretly, Rubashov must convince the dock workers that, despite the official policy, as communists they must unload the materials and not send them to the Italians.

Their cell leader, a German communist immigrant nicknamed Little Loewy, tells Rubashov his life&#x27;s story. He is a communist who has sacrificed much for the Party, but is still completely dedicated. When all the workers have gathered, Rubashov explains the situation. They react with disgust and refuse his instructions. Several days later, Party publications denounce the entire cell by name, virtually guaranteeing arrest by the Belgian authorities, who were trying to suppress communism. Little Loewy hangs himself. Rubashov then begins a new assignment.

In the novel, after about a week in prison, he is brought in for the first examination or hearing, which is conducted by Ivanov, an old friend. Also a veteran of the Civil War, he is an Old Bolshevik who shares Rubashov&#x27;s opinion of the Revolution. Rubashov had then convinced Ivanov not to commit suicide after his leg was amputated due to war wounds. Ivanov says that if he can persuade Rubashov to confess to the charges, he will have repaid his debt. With confession, Rubashov can lessen his sentence, to five or 10 years in a labour camp, instead of execution. He simply has to co-operate. The charges are hardly discussed, as both men understand they are not relevant. Rubashov says that he is &quot;tired&quot; and does not &quot;want to play this kind of game anymore&quot;. Ivanov sends him back to his cell, asking him to think about it. Ivanov implies that Rubashov can perhaps live to see the socialist utopia they have both worked so hard to create, and gives Rubashov two weeks to think matters over.

===The Second Hearing===
The next section of the book begins with an entry in Rubashov&#x27;s diary; he struggles to find his place and that of the other Old Bolsheviks, within the Marxist interpretation of history. Ivanov and a junior examiner, Gletkin, discuss Rubashov&#x27;s fate. Gletkin urges using harsh, physical methods to demoralise the prisoner and force his confession, while Ivanov insists that Rubashov will confess after realising it is the only &quot;logical&quot; thing to do, given his situation and also his past commitment to the party. Gletkin recalls that during the collectivisation of the peasants, they could not be persuaded to surrender their individual crops until they were tortured (and killed). Since that helped enable the ultimate goal of a socialist utopia, it was both the logical and the virtuous thing to do. Ivanov is disgusted but cannot refute Gletkin&#x27;s reasoning. Ivanov believes in taking harsh actions to achieve the goal, but he is troubled by the suffering he causes. Gletkin says the older man must not believe in the coming utopia. He characterises Ivanov as a cynic and claims to be an idealist.

Their conversation continues the theme of the new generation taking power over the old: Ivanov is portrayed as intellectual, ironical, and at bottom humane, while Gletkin is unsophisticated, straightforward, and unconcerned with others&#x27; suffering. Being also a Civil War veteran, Gletkin has his own experience of withstanding torture, yet still advocates its use. Ivanov has not been convinced by the younger man&#x27;s arguments. Rubashov continues in solitary.

News is tapped through to Rubashov that a prisoner is about to be executed. The condemned man is Michael Bogrov, the one-time distinguished revolutionary naval commander, who had a personal friendship with Rubashov. As Bogrov is carried off crying and screaming, all the prisoners, as is their tradition, drum along the walls to signal their brotherhood. Bogrov, as he passes Rubashov&#x27;s cell, despairingly calls out his name; Rubashov, having watched him pass by through the spy-hole in the door, is shocked at the pathetic figure Bogrov has become.

Some time later Ivanov visits Rubashov in his cell. He tells Rubashov that every aspect of Bogrov&#x27;s execution had been orchestrated by Gletkin to weaken Rubashov&#x27;s resolve, but that he (Ivanov) knows it will have the opposite effect. Ivanov tells Rubashov that he knows Rubashov will only confess if he resists his growing urge to sentimentality and instead remains rational, “[f]or when you have thought the whole thing to a conclusion – then, and only then, will you capitulate”. The two men have a discussion about politics and ethics. Afterwards Ivanov visits Gletkin in his office and insultingly tells him he was able to undo the damage that Gletkin&#x27;s scheme would have done.

===The Third Hearing and The Grammatical Fiction===
Rubashov continues to write in his diary, his views very much in line with Ivanov&#x27;s. He tells No. 402 that he intends to capitulate, and when No. 402 scolds him they get into a dispute over what honor is and break off contact with each other. Rubashov signs a letter to the state authorities in which he pledges &quot;utterly to renounce [my] oppositional attitude and to denounce publicly [my] errors&quot;.

Gletkin takes over the interrogation of Rubashov, using physical stresses such as sleep deprivation and forcing Rubashov to sit under a glaring lamp for hours, to wear him down. Later, when Gletkin refers to Ivanov in the past tense, Rubashov inquires about it, and Gletkin informs him that Ivanov has been executed. Rubashov notices that news of Ivanov&#x27;s fate has not made a meaningful impression on him, as he has evidently reached a state that precludes any deep emotion. Rubashov finally capitulates.

As he confesses to the false charges, Rubashov thinks of the many times he betrayed agents in the past: Richard, the young German; Little Loewy in Belgium; and Orlova, his secretary-mistress. He recognises that he is being treated with the same ruthlessness. His commitment to following his logic to its final conclusion—and his own lingering dedication to the Party—causes him to confess fully and publicly. The final section of the novel begins with a four-line quotation (&quot;Show us not the aim without the way...&quot;) by the German socialist Ferdinand Lassalle. Rubashov has a final tapped conversation with No. 402, and then is led away from his cell as the other prisoners, from behind the walls, drum in fraternity. The novel ends with Rubashov&#x27;s execution.

==Reception==
&quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; was very successful, selling half a million copies in France alone. Kingsley Martin described the novel as &quot;one of the few books written in this epoch which will survive it&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; as &quot;a splendid novel, an effective explanation of the riddle of the Moscow treason trials...written with such dramatic power, with such warmth of feeling and with such persuasive simplicity that it is absorbing as melodrama&quot;.

George Steiner said it was one of the few books that may have &quot;changed history&quot;, while George Orwell, who reviewed the book for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1941, stated:

Brilliant as this book is as a novel, and a piece of brilliant literature, it is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the Moscow &quot;confessions&quot; by someone with an inner knowledge of totalitarian methods. What was frightening about these trials was not the fact that they happened—for obviously such things are necessary in a totalitarian society—but the eagerness of Western intellectuals to justify them.
==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted as a stage play by Sidney Kingsley circa 1950, which was made into a 1955 television production on the American television series &quot;Producer’s Showcase&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==
Writers interested in the political struggles of the time followed Koestler and other Europeans closely. Orwell wrote, &quot;Rubashov might be called Trotsky, Bukharin, Rakovsky or some other relatively civilised figure among the Old Bolsheviks&quot;. In 1944, Orwell thought that the best political writing in English was being done by Europeans and other non-native British. His essay on Koestler discussed &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;. Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;, which was bout the Spanish Civil War, sold poorly; he decided after reviewing &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism, and wrote &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. When reviewing &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, Arthur Mizener said that Orwell drew on his feelings about Koestler&#x27;s handling of Rubashov&#x27;s confession when he wrote his extended section of the conversion of Winston Smith.

In 1954, at the end of a long government inquiry and a show trial, Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu, the former high-ranking Romanian Communist Party member and government official, was sentenced to death in Romania. According to his collaborator Belu Zilber, Pătrăşcanu read &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; in Paris while envoy to the 1946 Peace Conference, and took the book back to Romania. Both American and European communists considered &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; to be anti-Stalinist and anti-USSR. In the 1940s, numerous scriptwriters in Hollywood were still communists, generally having been attracted to the party during the 1930s. According to Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley in an article published in 2000, communists considered Koestler&#x27;s novel important enough to prevent its being adapted for movies; the writer Dalton Trumbo &quot;bragged&quot; about his success in that to the newspaper &quot;The Worker&quot;.

U.S. Navy admiral James Stockdale used the novel&#x27;s title as a code to his wife and the U.S. government to fool his North Vietnamese captors&#x27; censors when he wrote as a POW during the Vietnam War. He signaled the torture of American POW&#x27;s by communist North Vietnam: &quot;One thinks of Vietnam as a tropical country, but in January the rains came, and there was cold and darkness, even at noon.&quot; His wife contacted U.S. Naval Intelligence and Stockdale confirmed in code in other letters that they were being tortured. At the height of the media attention during the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, U.S. President Bill Clinton reportedly referred to Koestler&#x27;s novel, telling an aide &quot;I feel like a character in the novel &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;&quot; and &quot;I am surrounded by an oppressive force that is creating a lie about me and I can&#x27;t get the truth out.&quot;

The novel is of special interest to historians of British propaganda, due to the heavy financial support that the novel secretly received from the Information Research Department (IRD), a covert branch of the UK Foreign Office dedicated to disinformation, pro-colonial, and anti-communist propaganda. The IRD bought thousands of copies to inflate sales statistics, and also used British embassies to translate and distribute the novel to be used as Cold War propaganda.

==Theory of the masses==
Rubashov resigns himself to the reality that people are not capable of self-governance nor even of steering a democratic government to their own benefit. He asserts this is true for a period of time following technological advancements—a period in which people as a group have yet to learn to adapt to and harness, or at least respond to the technological advancements in a way that actually benefits them. Until this period of adaptation runs its course, Rubashov comes to accept that a totalitarian government is perhaps not unjustified as people would only steer society to their own detriment anyway. Having reached this conclusion, Rubashov resigns himself to execution without defending himself against charges of treason.

Every jump of technical progress leaves the relative intellectual development of the masses a step behind, and thus causes a fall in the political-maturity thermometer. It takes sometimes tens of years, sometimes generations, for a people&#x27;s level of understanding gradually to adapt itself to the changed state of affairs, until it has recovered the same capacity for self-government as it had already possessed at a lower stage of civilization. (Hardy translation)

And so every leap of technical progress brings with it a relative intellectual regression of the masses, a decline in their political maturity. At times it may take decades or even generations before the collective consciousness gradually catches up to the changed order and regains the capacity to govern itself that it had formerly possessed at a lower stage of civilization. (Boehm translation)

<doc id="619370" wikidata="Q369745" url="?curid=619370" title="Luciferin">
<text>Luciferin () is a generic term for the light-emitting compound found in organisms that generate bioluminescence. Luciferins typically undergo an enzyme-catalyzed reaction with molecular oxygen. The resulting transformation, which usually involves breaking off a molecular fragment, produces an excited state intermediate that emits light upon decaying to its ground state. The term may refer to molecules that are substrates for both luciferases and photoproteins.

== Types ==
Luciferins are a class of small-molecule substrates that react with oxygen in the presence of a luciferase (an enzyme) to release energy in the form of light. It is not known just how many types of luciferins there are, but some of the better-studied compounds are listed below. 

Because of the chemical diversity of luciferins, there is no clear unifying mechanism of action, except that all require molecular oxygen, The variety of luciferins and luciferases, their diverse reaction mechanisms and the scattered phylogenetic distribution indicate that many of them have arisen independently in the course of evolution.

=== Firefly ===
Firefly luciferin is the luciferin found in many Lampyridae species, such as &quot;P. pyralis&quot;. It is the substrate of beetle luciferases (EC 1.13.12.7) responsible for the characteristic yellow light emission from fireflies, though can cross-react to produce light with related enzymes from non-luminous species. The chemistry is unusual, as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is required for light emission, in addition to molecular oxygen.

=== Snail ===

Latia luciferin is, in terms of chemistry, (&quot;E&quot;)-2-methyl-4-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohex-1-yl)-1-buten-1-ol formate and is from the freshwater snail &quot;Latia neritoides&quot;.

=== Bacterial ===

Bacterial luciferin is two-component system consisting of flavin mononucleotide and a fatty aldehyde found in bioluminescent bacteria.

=== Coelenterazine ===
Coelenterazine is found in radiolarians, ctenophores, cnidarians, squid, brittle stars, copepods, chaetognaths, fish, and shrimp. It is the prosthetic group in the protein aequorin responsible for the blue light emission.

=== Dinoflagellate ===
Dinoflagellate luciferin is a chlorophyll derivative (i. e. a tetrapyrrole) and is found in some dinoflagellates, which are often responsible for the phenomenon of nighttime glowing waves (historically this was called phosphorescence, but is a misleading term). A very similar type of luciferin is found in some types of euphausiid shrimp.

=== Vargulin ===
Vargulin is found in certain ostracods and deep-sea fish, to be specific, &quot;Poricthys&quot;. Like the compound coelenterazine, it is an imidazopyrazinone and emits primarily blue light in the animals.

=== Fungi ===

Foxfire is the bioluminescence created by some species of fungi present in decaying wood. While there may be multiple different luciferins within the kingdom of fungi, 3-hydroxy hispidin was determined to be the luciferin in the fruiting bodies of several species of fungi, including &quot;Neonothopanus nambi&quot;, &quot;Omphalotus olearius&quot;, &quot;Omphalotus nidiformis&quot;, and &quot;Panellus stipticus&quot;.

== Usage in science ==
Luciferin is widely used in science and medicine as a method of &quot;in vivo&quot; imaging, using living organisms to non-invasively detect images and in molecular imaging. The reaction between luciferin substrate paired with the receptor enzyme luciferase produces a catalytic reaction, generating bioluminescence. This reaction and the luminescence produced is useful for imaging such as detecting tumors from cancer or capable of measuring gene expression.

<text>Peter Camani is a Canadian artist and sculptor who currently resides near Burk&#x27;s Falls, Ontario. His property, the &quot;Midlothian Castle&quot;, is notable for being an expansive sculpture garden, featuring countless statues, structures, assemblage artworks and Camani&#x27;s castle-like house. The location is commonly known as &quot;Screaming Heads&quot;. 

== Biography ==
Peter Camani grew up in Hamilton, Ontario, and took interest in art at an early age. He attended the University of Waterloo in Sciences, but in his third year transferred from sciences to the arts. After graduating with a B.A., he went to Western University, later becoming an art teacher at Almaguin Highlands Secondary School in South River, Ontario.
Camani began working on his property-wide art project around 1981. Retiring from teaching in 2008, he has continued his creative endeavours, the collection of art on his property ever expanding.

== Screaming Heads ==

Peter Camani&#x27;s &quot;Midlothian Castle&quot;, commonly known as &quot;Screaming Heads&quot;, is a public art installation featuring numerous sculptures, artworks and structures. The monolithic, 20 foot high concrete sculptures range from Munch-like screaming faces to hands, horses, and memorials.

Camani&#x27;s home is a farm house converted into a castle, topped with a turret resembling a screaming face and a two-headed dragon sitting atop the chimney. Facing the road is a wall topped with busts of people reenacting the &quot;see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil&quot; proverb, while facing the parking lot is a towering metal gate that resembles a spider web.

Camani is responsible for planting many of the trees on his property, which was once barren farmland, as well as propagating spring-fed ponds. The large concrete structures are arranged in such a way that they form the shape of a dragon when viewed from the air, although trees now obscure some of the statues. Camani has explained that his sculptures stand as a warning against environmental degradation, resembling &quot;the earth rebelling against what we’re doing to the land.&quot;

Of the public&#x27;s perception of his work, Camani has commented via his website;

A small screaming head statue can also be found outside the Burk&#x27;s Falls Welcome Centre.

=== Harvest Festival ===

Camani&#x27;s grounds are the location of an annual &quot;Harvest Festival&quot;, a weekend-long event that takes place in mid September showcasing electronic dance musicians, DJs, and other activities.

The large, steel-frame structures on Camani&#x27;s property were erected by festival organizers to serve as performance and eating venues. While these structures are left bare for most of the year, when covered with fabric they come to resemble a crashed spaceship, pyramids and domes.

=== Media appearances ===

Camani&#x27;s castle has been featured several times on Canadian television, including the CBC series &quot;On The Road Again&quot;, Arthur Black&#x27;s &quot;Weird Homes&quot; and more. Peter Camani was also the subject of the 1996 documentary &quot;Concrete Ambitions&quot;, a film which won two awards.

In 2011, Peter&#x27;s house was featured in the first episode of MTV&#x27;s Extreme Cribs.

== Film ==

In 2005, Peter Camani, in collaboration with director Dallas Boyes, began production on a fantasy film entitled &quot;Witch Way&quot;. The film was shot in Screaming Heads and the surrounding Burk&#x27;s Falls area. Camani employed the help of students from Almaguin Highlands Secondary School, along with local musicians Paul Shillolo and Jeff Stamp. An &quot;Almaguin News&quot; article suggests editing for the film was completed sometime in 2008, with a trailer being shared via Camani&#x27;s old website. However, for unknown reasons, it appears the film never saw a public release.

<doc id="619373" wikidata="Q20745539" url="?curid=619373" title="Madame X">
<text>Madame X (original title La Femme X) is a 1908 play by French playwright Alexandre Bisson (1848–1912). It was novelized in English and adapted for the American stage; it was also adapted for the screen sixteen times over sixty-five years, including versions in Tagalog, Greek, Arabic, Greek, and Spanish as well as English. The play has been cited as an example of the literary tradition of portraying the mother figure as being &quot;excessively punished for slight deviation from her maternal role&quot;.

==Plot==
The protagonist is a woman who has been thrown out into the street without any money by her jealous husband, when he discovers she has been carrying on an affair. She is not even allowed to see their young son. She sinks into depravity.

Twenty years later, she has become the mistress of a criminal. When he finds out that her husband is now the attorney general, her lover decides to blackmail him. Desperate to shield her son from her disgrace, she shoots and kills her lover.

By chance, the lawyer assigned to her turns out to be her own son, on his first case. He is puzzled and frustrated when she refuses to defend herself in court, or even to provide her name (which forces the tribunal to identify her as &quot;Madame X&quot;). During the trial, her husband shows up in support of his son. When the defendant sees that her husband recognizes her and is about to speak out, she makes an impassioned plea, not for mercy but for understanding of what drove her to murder. As she had intended, the hidden message silences her husband. When she faints from the strain, she is carried into a private chamber. There, she kisses her still-unaware son and dies.

<doc id="619375" wikidata="Q5708577" url="?curid=619375" title="Hello (The Beloved song)">
<text>&quot;Hello&quot; is a song by British group the Beloved, released as the second single from their debut album, &quot;Happiness&quot; (1990). Peaking at Number 19 in the UK charts on 17 February 1990, it was band&#x27;s highest-charting single until &quot;Sweet Harmony&quot; reached number eight in 1993.

At least three additional remixes were exclusive to other formats: &quot;Hello (Boys &amp; Girls)&quot; and &quot;Hello (Uncle Arthur)&quot; appeared on the 12-inch vinyl version, and &quot;Hello (Dolly)&quot; appeared on both the cassette and 7-inch versions. In addition, a Razormaid! remix of the song appeared on the &quot;Razormaid! Anniversary 9.0&quot; compilation album. As for &quot;Hello (What&#x27;s All This Then?)&quot; and &quot;Hello (Honky Tonk),&quot; two of the five remixes of the main title on the CD single release, they would both later resurface on the following &quot;Blissed Out&quot; remix album, the sister release to &quot;Happiness&quot;, the second remix only featuring on the CD and MC editions of the work, but not on the vinyl LP, which only contained the first.

==Names==
As well as the names of some of the band members&#x27; friends, the song mentions a number of famous people (some of them fictional), chosen to loosely fit a &quot;saints and sinners&quot; theme.

In alphabetical order, the people listed in the song are: Jeffrey Archer (politician and novelist), Fred Astaire, Bobby Ball (comedian), Charlie Brown, Tommy Cannon (comedian), Billy Corkhill (soap opera character), Leslie Crowther (TV presenter), &quot;Freddie&quot; Flintstone, Paris Grey (singer), Brian Hayes (broadcaster), Vince Hilaire (footballer), Barry Humphries, The LSO, Kym Mazelle (singer), Mork and Mindy, Little Neepsie (often misheard as Little Nietzsche), Little Nell, Charlie Parker, André Previn, Little Richard, Salman Rushdie, Jean-Paul Sartre, The Supremes (&quot;Mary Wilson, Di and Flo&quot;), William Tell, Sir Bufton Tufton, Desmond Tutu, Willy Wonka, Zippy and Bungle (TV characters). There are also references to &quot;Peter&quot; and &quot;Paul&quot;, presumably the Christian apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul. &quot;Chris and Do&quot; are friends of the band while &quot;Steve and Claire&quot; are guitarist Steve Waddington and his girlfriend.

In lyrical order, the names mentioned are as follows: Peter, Paul, Tommy Cannon, Bobby Ball, Little Richard, Little Nell, Willy Wonka, William Tell, Salman Rushdie, Kym Mazelle, Mork and Mindy, Bryan Hayes, Barry Humphries, Paris Grey, Little Neepsie, Chris, Do, Billy Corkhill, Vince Hilaire, Freddy Flintstone, Fred Astaire, Desmond Tutu, Steve, Claire, Charlie Parker, Charlie Brown, Leslie Crowther, Mary Wilson, Di and Flo, Sir Bufton Tufton, Jean-Paul Sartre, Zippy, Bungle, Jeffrey Archer, André Previn and LSO.

==Critical reception==
Jon O&#x27;Brien from AllMusic noted that the &quot;gothic undertones&quot; of the &quot;Depeche Mode-influenced&quot; song &quot;perfectly bridged the gap between their indie beginnings and their new-found loved-up sound&quot;. Bill Coleman from &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;a rather infectious roll call of sorts that has already kicked in with modern rock enthusiasts, with clubs and pop radio ready to fuel the fire. Don&#x27;t miss.&quot; Ian Gittins from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; declared it as &quot;one sexy electro-growl, cooking round a roll call of modern icons&quot;. Another editor, Simon Reynolds, said, &quot;With its vapid catchiness and custard-yellow vocals, &quot;Hello&quot; will be huge, of course. But let&#x27;s face it, The Beloved have merely come up with a &quot;Reasons to Be Cheerful, Part Three&quot; for the E generation.&quot;

Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; called it &quot;a more funky number with a Beatle-style chorus&quot; and &quot;a splendid song with a shopping list of media celebrities&#x27; names forming the chorus lyrics.&quot; David Giles from &quot;Music Week&quot; commented, &quot;Much has been made of this band&#x27;s &quot;conversion&quot; from &quot;grey, lifeless&quot; indie music to &quot;bright, modern&quot; dance music. This hasn&#x27;t stopped them throwing in guitar solos and mumbling à la New Order, however. And the list of namechecks here has distinct Half Man Half Biscuit overtones. The use of a Fools Gold-style backing track is deceptive. A very clever record indeed.&quot; Stephen Dalton from &quot;NME&quot; wrote, &quot;These once-jangly disco stars are much too clever to make just a simple Dance record, filling this full-tilt funky hit with dozens of buried noises and a shopping list of names. &quot;&quot;Salman Rushdie and Kym Mazelle&quot;?&quot; A chart-topping formula if ever I heard one.&quot;

==Music video==
A music video was produced to promote the single, inspired by the film &quot;Altered States&quot;. It was later published on The Beloved&#x27;s official YouTube channel in December 2018.

<doc id="619376" wikidata="Q5094617" url="?curid=619376" title="Cheyne Coates">
<text>April M. Coates (born 6 September 1970) is an Australian singer, songwriter and producer who performs as Cheyne Coates or Cheyne. Coates (lead vocals) and Andrew Van Dorsselaer (a.k.a. Andy Van) (DJ and background vocals) comprised the duo Madison Avenue (1998–2003). Their song &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; peaked at number two on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Chart in 1999 and topped the charts in New Zealand and the United Kingdom in 2000, as well as the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance charts the United States. Since the break-up of Madison Avenue in 2003, Cheyne recorded an album, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, and its first single &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Your Number&quot; which reached No. 26 in 2004.

==Career==
===1998–2003: Madison Avenue===
During the 1990s, Cheyne Coates was a choreographer and singer in Melbourne. She performed at album launches by other artists and at fashion shows. Coates met record producer, DJ and songwriter Andrew Van Dorsselaer (Andy Van) in a dance club. He had co-founded a record label, Vicious Vinyl, in 1990 with John Course and Colin Daniels.

The duo started working together as Madison Avenue, initially as co-writers and producers in 1998. Their first single, &quot;Fly&quot;, featured Kellie Wolfgram as lead vocalist. It was co-written by Coates and Van Dorsselaer. Coates sang on Madison Avenue&#x27;s breakthrough single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; (October 1999), because Van preferred her version, which was recorded to be used as the guide track for the intended singer. It was co-written by Coates with Van Dorsselaer, Gene McFadden and John Whitehead. Van Dorsselaer took the song to the MIDEM Conference which led to the group being signed by Virgin Records in the UK and Sony Music for the rest of the world. Coates became established as the public face of the band although Madison Avenue were intended to be a collective dance group, similar to C&amp;C Music Factory or Soul II Soul.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It sold 200,000 singles in Australia, the best singles sales achieved by any Australian act in that country for 1999. Madison Avenue were the first Australian dance act to top the ARIA Singles Chart. The single was released internationally in 2000. In the United Kingdom, the single topped the UK Singles Chart in May 2000, selling 400,000 copies in Britain. &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; became the first single by an Australian group to top the charts in Britain since &quot;Down Under&quot; by Men at Work in February 1983, a feat it maintained for ten years until &quot;We No Speak Americano&quot; by Yolanda Be Cool and DCUP topped the UK Singles Chart in July 2010. It was a hit in other regions of Europe: Belgium (No. 16), France (No. 41), the Netherlands (No. 22), Sweden (No. 47) and Switzerland (No. 38). &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance charts in the United States.

Their debut album, &quot;The Polyester Embassy&quot;, was released in October 2000, which reached the No. 4 of the ARIA Albums Chart. It provided three more singles, &quot;Who the Hell Are You&quot; (July), was a number-one hit in Australia, and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Chart, also reaching No. 10 in the UK; &quot;Everything You Need&quot; (October) went to No. 6, which was certified gold in Australia, and it reached the top 40 in the UK; and &quot;Reminiscing&quot;, a cover version of the 1978 hit by Little River Band, which peaked at No. 9, it also reached No. 9 in the ARIA End of the Year Australian Singles Chart for that year.

Madison Avenue won the Best Dance Artist at the International Dance Awards in 2001 in Miami. Destiny&#x27;s Child, Madonna, *NSYNC and Britney Spears were also nominated for the award. At the end of 2001 Madison Avenue went into hiatus. Coates married and the couple had a child in 2002. Madison Avenue resumed performing in 2003 but split by mid-year.

===2004–2007: Solo career===
After Madison Avenue disbanded in 2003, Coates began work on her solo album, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, co-producing with Brian Canham (ex-Pseudo Echo), and Ewen McArthur. She started the Aperitif record label in the same year. Its first single, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Your Number&quot; (April 2004), reached No. 26 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was added to the play list on BBC Radio 1. Her second single, &quot;Taste You&quot;, peaked in the top 100 in July. She released &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; on 4 October 2004.

Her next feature was as vocalist on &quot;Lucky&quot; by the Canadian duo the Soundbluntz, released in July 2006, and their album, &quot;Blame the Bling&quot;, which followed in October. The album was issued globally in 2007. In 2008 Coates was filmed in a cameo role for Richard Wolstencroft&#x27;s feature film version of &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

<doc id="619377" wikidata="Q535430" url="?curid=619377" title="Frank Serpico">
<text>Francesco Vincent &quot;Frank&quot; Serpico ( ; born April 14, 1936) is an American retired New York Police Department detective, best known for whistleblowing on police corruption. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was a plainclothes police officer working in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan to expose vice racketeering. In 1967, he reported credible evidence of widespread police corruption, to no effect. In 1970, he contributed to a front-page story in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on widespread corruption in the NYPD, which drew national attention to the problem. Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed a five-member panel to investigate accusations of police corruption, which became the Knapp Commission.

Serpico was shot in the face during an arrest attempt on February 3, 1971, at 778 Driggs Avenue, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The bullet severed an auditory nerve, and left bullet fragments lodged in his brain. The circumstances surrounding Serpico&#x27;s shooting were quickly called into question, raising the possibility that Serpico had been led to the apartment by his colleagues to be murdered. There was no formal investigation, but Edgar Echevarria, who had shot Serpico, was subsequently convicted of attempted murder.

Much of Serpico&#x27;s fame came after the release of the 1973 film &quot;Serpico,&quot; in which he was portrayed by Al Pacino, based on the book of the same name by Peter Maas. On June 27, 2013, the USA Section of ANPS (National Association of Italian State Police) awarded him the &quot;Saint Michael Archangel Prize&quot;. During the ceremony, he gained Italian citizenship, and received an Italian passport.

==Early life==
Serpico was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the youngest child of Vincenzo and Maria Giovanna Serpico, Italian immigrants from Marigliano, Naples, Campania. His older siblings, Pasquale, Salvatore and Tina were also born in Brooklyn. Serpico attended high school at the prestigious St. Francis Preparatory School and graduated in 1954, according to their on-line alumni data. In 1954, at the age of 17, he then enlisted in the United States Army and was stationed for two years in South Korea as an infantryman. After his service in the army, from about 1954 to 1956, he worked as a part-time private investigator and as a youth counselor while attending Brooklyn College. Serpico later received a Bachelor of Science degree from City College of New York. He attended the New York Police Academy and was sworn in as a probationary patrolman on September 11, 1959.

==Career==
===NYPD===
On September 11, 1959, Serpico joined the New York City Police Department (NYPD) as a probationary patrolman, and became a full patrolman on March 5, 1960. He was assigned to the 81st precinct, then worked for the Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI) for two years. He was then assigned to plainclothes undercover work, during which he eventually exposed widespread corruption.

Serpico was a plainclothes police officer working in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan to expose vice racketeering. In 1967, he reported credible evidence of systemic police corruption, and saw no effect until he met another police officer, David Durk, who helped him. Serpico believed his partners knew about his secret meetings with police investigators. Finally, he contributed to an April 25, 1970 front-page story in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on widespread corruption in the NYPD, which drew national attention to the problem. Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed a five-member panel to investigate accusations of police corruption. The panel became the Knapp Commission, named after its chairman, Whitman Knapp.

====Shooting and public interest====
Serpico was shot during a drug arrest attempt on February 3, 1971, at 778 Driggs Avenue, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Four officers from the Brooklyn North police command had received a tip that a drug deal was about to take place. Two policemen, Gary Roteman and Arthur Cesare, stayed outside, while the third, Paul Halley, stood in front of the apartment building. Serpico climbed up the fire escape, entered by the fire escape door, went downstairs, listened for the password, then followed two suspects outside.

The police arrested the young suspects, and found one had two bags of heroin. Halley stayed with the suspects, and Roteman told Serpico, who spoke Spanish, to make a fake purchase in attempt to get the drug dealers to open the door. The police went to the third-floor landing. Serpico knocked on the door, keeping his hand on his revolver. The door opened a few inches, just far enough to wedge his body in. Serpico called for help, but his fellow officers ignored him.

Serpico was then shot in the face by the suspect with a .22 LR pistol. The bullet struck just below the eye, lodging at the top of his jaw. He fired back, striking his assailant, fell to the floor, and began to bleed profusely. His police colleagues refused to make a &quot;10-13&quot; dispatch to police headquarters, indicating that an officer had been shot. An elderly man who lived in the next apartment called the emergency services, reporting that a man had been shot, and stayed with Serpico. When a police car arrived, aware that Serpico was a fellow officer, they transported him in the patrol car to Greenpoint Hospital.

The bullet had severed an auditory nerve, leaving him deaf in one ear, and he has since suffered from chronic pain from bullet fragments lodged in his brain. He was visited the day after the shooting by Mayor John V. Lindsay and Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy, and the police department harassed him with hourly bed checks. He later testified before the Knapp Commission.

The circumstances surrounding Serpico&#x27;s shooting were quickly called into question. Serpico, who was armed during the drug raid, had been shot only after briefly turning away from the suspect, when he realized that the two officers who had accompanied him to the scene were not following him into the apartment, raising the question whether Serpico had actually been taken to the apartment by his colleagues to be murdered. There was no formal investigation. Edgar Echevarria, who had shot Serpico, was subsequently convicted of attempted murder.
On May 3, 1971, &quot;New York Metro Magazine&quot; published an article, &quot;Portrait of an Honest Cop,&quot; about him, a week before he testified at the departmental trial of an NYPD lieutenant accused of taking bribes from gamblers.

====Testimony before the Knapp Commission====
In October, and again in December 1971, Serpico testified before the Knapp Commission:
Serpico was the first police officer in the history of the New York City Police Department to step forward to report, and subsequently testify openly about, widespread, systemic corruption payoffs amounting to millions of dollars.

====Retirement and activism====
Serpico retired on June 15, 1972, one month after receiving the New York City Police Department&#x27;s highest honor, the Medal of Honor. There was no ceremony; according to Serpico, it was simply handed to him over the desk &quot;like a pack of cigarettes.&quot; In 2014, Serpico said that the NYPD still had not issued him the certificate that normally would accompany the honor.
In December 2021, Eric Adams, the mayor-elect of New York City and a former NYPD officer, said &quot;[Serpico&#x27;s] bravery inspired my law enforcement career&quot; and said that he would ensure that the omission was corrected. On February 3, 2022, Serpico received the certificate, which he greeted with an improvised &quot;21-gun salute&quot; made with the sound of popping bubble wrap.

Following his retirement in 1972, he went to Switzerland to recuperate, spending almost a decade living there. He also lived on a farm in the Netherlands and spent time traveling and studying in Western Europe.

When it was decided to make the movie about his life called &quot;Serpico,&quot; Al Pacino invited the officer to stay with him at a house that Pacino had rented in Montauk, New York. Pacino asked him about why he had stepped forward, and Serpico replied, &quot;Well, Al, I don&#x27;t know. I guess I would have to say it would be because... if I didn&#x27;t, who would I be when I listened to a piece of music?&quot; He has credited his grandfather (who had once been assaulted and robbed), and his uncle (a respected policeman in Italy), for his own sense of justice.

He returned to the U.S. briefly in June 1974 to deliver a nomination speech for Ramsey Clark, candidate for United States Senator, at the New York State Democratic Party&#x27;s convention in Niagara Falls. Clark was nominated, but lost the general election to incumbent Republican Jacob Javits.

While travelling in Europe from 1979 to 1980, Serpico lived in Orissor College in Corwen, Wales; he was one of the founders and Director of Orissor (which had been known as the Old Union Work House and, more recently, as Corwen Manor: his signature appears on the deeds). He was well known in and around Corwen and frequently mixed in the town&#x27;s pubs. After a disagreement with Orissor, he stayed for a few weeks in a B&amp;B before returning to New York City in 1980.

Serpico still speaks out about police brutality, civil liberties, and police corruption, such as the attempted cover-ups following Abner Louima&#x27;s torture in 1997 and Amadou Diallo&#x27;s shooting in 1999. He provides support to &quot;individuals who seek truth and justice even in the face of great personal risk,&quot; calling them &quot;lamp lighters&quot;; he prefers that term in place of the more conventional &quot;whistleblower,&quot; which refers to alerting the public to danger, in the spirit of Paul Revere&#x27;s midnight ride during the American Revolutionary War.

In an October 2014 interview published by &quot;Politico&quot; entitled &quot;The Police Are Still Out of Control... I Should Know,&quot; Serpico addresses contemporary issues of police violence.

In 2015, Serpico ran for a seat on the town board of Stuyvesant, New York, where he lives, his first foray into politics, but was not elected.

Among police officers, his actions are still controversial, but Eugene O&#x27;Donnell, professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said in 2011 that &quot;he becomes more of a heroic figure with every passing year.&quot;

On August 19, 2017, Serpico gave a speech which was broadcast live on Facebook as he stood with NYPD police officers in New York City on the bank of the East River at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge in support of Colin Kaepernick, for his protests alleging a culture of police brutality. Serpico said, &quot;I am here to support anyone who has the courage to stand up against injustice and oppression anywhere in this country and the world.&quot;

===Effect on the NYPD===
As a result of Serpico&#x27;s efforts, some have claimed that the NYPD has drastically changed. Michael Armstrong, who was counsel to the Knapp Commission and went on to become chairman of the city&#x27;s Commission to Combat Police Corruption, observed in 2012, &quot;the attitude throughout the department seems fundamentally hostile to the kind of systemized graft that had been a way of life almost 40 years ago.&quot; However, Serpico disagrees, stating in 2010 that, &quot;An honest cop still can&#x27;t find a place to go and complain without fear of recrimination. The blue wall will always be there because the system supports it.&quot; The New York City Commission to Combat Police Corruption has become a permanent advisory body, and in its 2018 report while noting that there has been progress on NYPD corruption and transparency, offered 13 suggestions covering a range of reporting, transparency, and adjudication procedures. In its 2022 interim NYPD response report to the commission&#x27;s report, the NYPD responded to 5 of the suggestions, rejecting 3 as inappropriate or unnecessary. Also in the late 1970s and early 1980s, vice laws were generally not enforced to prevent police corruption. Consequently, bookmakers and drug dealers often operated openly out of storefronts, while prostitutes openly advertised and often plied their wares in various &quot;red-light&quot; sections of the city.

==Life after the NYPD==
On June 15, 1972, Serpico left both the NYPD and U.S. to move to Switzerland and later the Netherlands and also travelled throughout Western Europe. In 1973, while living in the Netherlands, he became involved with a woman named Marianne whom he wed in a &quot;spiritual marriage&quot; and called her his &quot;true soul mate.&quot; She later died from cancer.

Reportedly, after his return to the U.S., he became involved with a woman known only as &quot;L. Pamela P.&quot; through the court system. She claimed they have a biological son together, Alexander Serpico, born 3/15/1980, and sued him for child support. Serpico contested the child support order, claiming that the mother told him she was on the contraceptive pill, an allegation she denied, but her friend testified against her in court. He lost his case on appeal and a tribunal ruled he had to pay $945 per month. Serpico was represented in his suit by Karen DeCrow, former president of the National Organization for Women. Alexander died of a suspected drug overdose on May 12, 2021. He was 41.

On June 27, 2013, the USA Section of ANPS (National Association of Italian State Police) assigned him the &quot;Saint Michael Archangel Prize,&quot; an official award by the Italian State Police with the Sponsorship of the Italian Ministry of Interior. During the ceremony, he received his first Italian passport. He was granted citizenship after extended research by the president of ANPS USA, Chief Inspector Cirelli, who established the &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; or &quot;right of blood&quot;. This legal principle, common in Europe, determines citizenship based on the nationality of a person&#x27;s parents and, thus, allowed him to gain Italian citizenship.

<doc id="619378" wikidata="Q2664039" url="?curid=619378" title="Portrait of Madame X">
<text>Madame X or Portrait of Madame X is a portrait painting by John Singer Sargent of a young socialite, Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, wife of the French banker Pierre Gautreau. &quot;Madame X&quot; was painted not as a commission, but at the request of Sargent. It is a study in opposition. Sargent shows a woman posing in a black satin dress with jeweled straps, a dress that reveals and hides at the same time. The portrait is characterized by the pale flesh tone of the subject contrasted against a dark-colored dress and background.

The scandal resulting from the painting&#x27;s controversial reception at the Paris Salon of 1884 amounted to a temporary setback to Sargent while in France, though it may have helped him later establish a successful career in Britain and America.

==Background==
The model was an American French creole immigrant from New Orleans in Louisiana who married a French banker twice her age and became notorious in Parisian high society for her beauty and rumored sexual infidelities. She wore lavender powder and prided herself on her appearance. She was referred to as a &quot;professional beauty&quot; – a term for a woman who uses personal skills to advance herself socially. Her unconventional beauty made her an object of fascination for artists; the American painter Edward Simmons claimed that he &quot;could not stop stalking her as one does a deer.&quot; Sargent was also impressed, and anticipated that a portrait of Gautreau would garner much attention at the upcoming Paris Salon, and increase interest in portrait commissions. He wrote to a friend:
I have a great desire to paint her portrait and have reason to think she would allow it and is waiting for someone to propose this homage to her beauty. If you are &#x27;bien avec elle&#x27; and will see her in Paris, you might tell her I am a man of prodigious talent.

Although she had refused numerous similar requests from painters, Gautreau accepted Sargent&#x27;s offer in February 1883. Sargent was an expatriate like Gautreau, and their collaboration has been interpreted as motivated by a shared desire to attain high status in French society.

==Studies==

Little progress was made during the winter of 1883, as Gautreau was distracted by social engagements, and was not by nature inclined to the discipline of sitting for a portrait. At her suggestion, Sargent traveled to her estate in Brittany in June, where he commenced a series of preparatory works in pencil, watercolors, and oils. About thirty drawings resulted from these sessions, in which many poses were attempted. Like the eventual portrait, an oil sketch entitled &quot;Madame Gautreau Drinking a Toast&quot; (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), shows the subject&#x27;s profile and bare arms against a dark background, but is of a more freely brushed and informal character.

Just as she had been in Paris, in the country Gautreau was bored by the process of sitting; here, too, there were social engagements, as well as the responsibilities of tending to her four-year-old daughter, her mother, house guests, and a full domestic staff. Sargent complained of &quot;the unpaintable beauty and hopeless laziness of Madame Gautreau.&quot;

==Execution==
As in his previous entries to the Salon, &quot;The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit&quot; and &quot;El Jaleo&quot;, Sargent chose a canvas of dimensions large enough to ensure notice on the crowded Salon walls. The pose proved to be different from any of those tried in the preliminary works. Gautreau had to stand with her body facing the artist while her head was turned away, her right arm extended behind her for support, her hand on a low table; the result was to create tension in the neck and arm as well as to emphasize the subject&#x27;s elegant contours. For painting the unusual tone of Gautreau&#x27;s pale skin, Sargent used a palette composed of lead white, rose madder, vermilion, viridian, and bone black.

Even when composition had been decided upon and painting started, work progressed slowly. In a letter to a friend Sargent wrote &quot;One day I was dissatisfied with it and dashed a tone of light rose over the former gloomy background ... The &quot;élancée&quot; [tall and slender] figure of the model shows to much greater advantage.&quot; On September 7, Sargent wrote &quot;still at Paramé, basking in the sunshine of my beautiful model&#x27;s countenance&quot;. By the fall, Sargent&#x27;s interest in the venture was nearing completion, &quot;The summer is definitely over and with it, I admit, is my pleasure at being at Les Chênes [Gautreau&#x27;s estate]&quot;. While the work was in progress, Gautreau was enthusiastic; she believed that Sargent was painting a masterpiece.

==Description==

There is an assertion and showiness in the expanse of white skin – from her high forehead down her graceful neck, shoulders, and arms. Although the black of her dress is bold, it is also deep, recessive and mysterious. She is surrounded by a rich brown which is at once luminous and dark enough to provide contrast to the skin tones. Most disconcerting is the whiteness of the skin, an overt contrivance of &quot;aristocratic pallor&quot;; by contrast her red ear is a jarring reminder of the color of flesh unadorned.

Sargent chose the pose for Gautreau carefully: her body boldly faces forward while her head is turned in profile. A profile is both assertion and retreat; half of the face is hidden while, at the same time, the part that shows can seem more defined than full face.

The table provides support for Gautreau, and echoes her curves and stance. At the time, her pose was considered sexually suggestive. As originally exhibited, one strap of her gown had fallen down Gautreau&#x27;s right shoulder, suggesting the possibility of further revelation; &quot;One more struggle&quot;, wrote a critic in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, &quot;and the lady will be free&quot;. (Perhaps unknown to the critic, the bodice was constructed over a metal and whalebone foundation and could not have fallen; the shoulder straps were ornamental).

The image&#x27;s erotic suggestion is of a distinctly upper-class sort: unnaturally pale skin, cinched waist, severity of profile and an emphasis on aristocratic bone structure all imply a distant sexuality &quot;under the professional control of the sitter&quot;, rather than offered for the viewer&#x27;s delectation.

Classical sources, such as the figures in a fresco by Francesco de&#x27; Rossi, have been suggested as inspiration for the pose. The painting features several subtle classical references: sirens of Greek mythology adorn the table&#x27;s legs, and the crescent tiara worn by Gautreau symbolizes the goddess Diana. The latter was not contrived by the artist, but was part of Gautreau&#x27;s self-display.

==Reception==
Immediate reactions to the painting were strongly negative. Sargent attended the opening of the Paris Salon&#x27;s 1884 exhibition, at which &quot;Madame X&quot; (under the title &quot;Portrait de Mme ***)&quot; was first exhibited, along with Ralph Wormeley Curtis. Curtis wrote that &quot;There was a grande tapage [mob] before it all day.&quot; While some artists praised Sargent&#x27;s style, Curtis wrote that the general public reaction was overwhelmingly negative: &quot;All the women jeer. Ah voilà &#x27;la belle!&#x27; &#x27;Oh quelle horreur!&#x27; [Ah, here is &#x27;the beauty&#x27;!&#x27; &#x27;Oh how horrible!&#x27;] etc.&quot;

Shortly after the exhibition&#x27;s opening, negative reviews began pouring in. The first, in &quot;L&#x27;Événement&quot; (a French newspaper), read:&quot;Mr. Sargent made a mistake if he thinks he expressed the shattering beauty of his model ... . Even recognizing certain qualities that the painting has, we are shocked by the spineless expression and the vulgar character of the figure.&quot;Similar reviews followed suit. Many focused on the perceived unattractiveness of the painting&#x27;s subject, particularly in comparison to the reputation Gautreau (whose identity was only thinly veiled by the anonymity of the painting&#x27;s title) had as a great beauty, and often focusing on her skin, which was described as &quot;pallid&quot; and &quot;corpse-ish&quot;.

Others focused on the sexuality of the portrait. One critic for &quot;L&#x27;Artiste&quot; wrote, &quot;Of all the undressed women at the Salon this year, the most interesting is Madame Gautreau ... because of the indecency of her dress that looks like it is about to fall off.&quot; The painting&#x27;s standoffish promiscuity was lampooned. &quot;La Vie Parisienne&quot; published a caricature of &quot;Madame X&quot;, depicting Gautreau with her bosom exposed. The caption read: &quot;Mélie, your dress is falling off!&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s on purpose. ... And leave me alone anyway, won&#x27;t you?&quot;

Some reviews accused Sargent of trying to manufacture scandal, with a writer for &quot;Art Amateur&quot; calling &quot;Madame X&quot; &quot;a wilful exaggeration of every one of his vicious eccentricities, simply for the purpose of being talked about and provoking argument.&quot;

A comparatively small number of positive reviews focused on the perceptions of future audiences, with one theorizing that &quot;if it is true that each generation remakes in its own image the work of nature, then future critics will see here our Parisian cosmopolitanism manifested in ideal form.&quot;

== Aftermath ==

Sargent was severely disappointed by the public reaction to &quot;Madame X&quot;. Ralph Curtis wrote of Sargent&#x27;s reaction on the day of the exhibition&#x27;s opening, &quot;John, poor boy, was navré [heartbroken].&quot; Gautreau, too, was distressed: &quot;Mde. Gautreau and mère [mother] came to his studio &#x27;bathed in tears.&#x27;&quot; Gautreau&#x27;s mother requested that Sargent withdraw the painting from the exhibition. Sargent refused, saying he had painted her &quot;exactly as she was dressed, that nothing could be said of the canvas worse than had been said in print of her appearance&quot;. Later, Sargent overpainted the shoulder strap to raise it up and make it look more securely fastened. An unfinished version of the same pose, in which the position of the right shoulder strap remained unresolved, is in the Tate, London.

Sargent hung &quot;Madame X&quot; first in his Paris studio, and later in his studio in London. Starting in 1905, he displayed it in a number of international exhibitions.

Seven years after Sargent painted Madame Gautreau, Gustave Courtois painted her. As in the earlier painting, the portrait shows her face in profile. She wears the same style of dress, with Courtois&#x27;s portrait showing a bit more skin. The strap of her dress hangs off her shoulder much as it had in Sargent&#x27;s portrait. This time, however, the portrait was well received by the public. In 1897 Gautreau posed yet again for a standing portrait, for what would be her favorite version, by Antonio de La Gándara.

In 1916, Sargent sold the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, writing to its director, &quot;I suppose it is the best thing I have ever done.&quot; The art world&#x27;s changing response to the portrait was noted by the &quot;New York Herald&quot; in its May 12, 1916, headline: &quot;Sargent Masterpiece Rejected by Subject Now Acquired by Museum.&quot; In 1960, Cuban-American fashion designer Luis Estévez created a dress based on the dress depicted in &quot;Madame X&quot;. Dina Merrill modeled the Estévez dress for photographer Milton H. Greene published in &quot;Life&quot; magazine on 11 January 1960.

The 1980s saw a renewed interest in Sargent&#x27;s work. Today, &quot;Portrait of Madame X&quot; is Sargent&#x27;s best-known work.

== Analysis ==
Art historians have used &quot;Madame X&quot; to examine the conventions, particularly regarding sexuality and dress, of the time period during which it was exhibited.

Concerning the black gown depicted in the portrait, dress historian Aileen Ribeiro writes that &quot;The dress is so scandalous even an actress would have thought twice about wearing it for a portrait.&quot; Valerie Steele, a dress historian and the curator of the Museum at FIT, further contextualizes why contemporary audiences found &quot;Madame X&quot;&#x27;s dress so shocking: &quot;&#x27;Though the cuirass would have had some kind of lining to soak up sweat, the model would not have been wearing any underwear.&quot; Dress historian Justine De Young, however, argues that &quot;it was not the dress itself that prompted criticism, but instead her way of wearing it (with the slipped shoulder strap and heavy make-up).&quot;

Art historian Dorothy Moss analyzed contemporary reviews, positing that &quot;The language of contemporary criticism reveals that it was [Sargent&#x27;s] emphasis on the sitter&#x27;s artifice that, above all, excited the critics.&quot; Art historian Elizabeth Renes explains that &quot;Sargent uses two techniques in Madame X to bring focus to her &#x27;whiteness&#x27; and her &#x27;cosmetic exterior&#x27;: the dark background, which creates a high contrast to further highlight her skin, and the uncomfortable, sculptural pose, paired with the simplicity of the gown, which forces more of her flesh into view.&quot; Naturalness was the ideal of beauty at the time, and &quot;Madame X&quot; &quot;defiantly violated this cherished precept of nineteenth-century decorum.&quot;

Art historian Susan Sidlauskas lists &quot;the brazenness of [Gautreau&#x27;s] self-display; the singularity of her adornments, both sartorial and cosmetic; and the crudeness of her American ambitiousness&quot; as &quot;evident&quot; reasons why audiences were offended by &quot;Madame X&quot;. Sidlauskas also argues that, on a subconscious level, &quot;Gautreau aroused the anxieties of her audience&quot; as her carefully-styled appearance rested in an uncanny valley between life and death. Sidlauskas particularly focuses on Gautreau&#x27;s powdered skin, which audiences found unsettling. By inviting attention, but not necessarily attraction, &quot;Gautreauthrough Sargentbrazenly defied the conventions for feminine display, and in so doing spurned the visible signs of masculine possession.&quot;

Deborah Davis, author of &quot;Strapless: John Singer Sargent and the Fall of Madame X&quot;, notes that women were particularly vocal about their disapproval of &quot;Madame X&quot;, &quot;as if to assert their moral superiority.&quot; Davis also explains that, while there were plenty of nude paintings exhibited alongside &quot;Madame X&quot;, none of which were the subject of scandal, &quot;nude women in paintings could be only historical or mythological figures, or anonymous types.&quot; While Gautreau&#x27;s identity was technically obscured in the title, it was widely known. Because Gautreau was a public figure and a married woman, her suggestive appearance was more shocking than works which were &quot;mindful of the conventions regarding nudes&quot;.

<doc id="619382" wikidata="Q414583" url="?curid=619382" title="Pyrroloquinoline quinone">
<text>Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), also called methoxatin&quot;,&quot; is a redox cofactor and antioxidant.

Quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase is used as a glucose sensor in bacteria. PQQ stimulates growth in bacteria.

== History ==
It was discovered by J. G. Hauge in 1964 as the third redox cofactor after nicotinamide and flavin in bacteria (although he hypothesised that it was naphthoquinone). Anthony and Zatman also found the unknown redox cofactor in alcohol dehydrogenase. In 1979, Salisbury and colleagues as well as Duine and colleagues extracted this prosthetic group from methanol dehydrogenase of methylotrophs and identified its molecular structure. Adachi and colleagues discovered that PQQ was also found in &quot;Acetobacter&quot;.

== Biosynthesis ==

A novel aspect of PQQ is its biosynthesis in bacteria from a ribosomally translated precursor peptide, PqqA (UniProt ). A glutamic acid and a tyrosine in PqqA are cross-linked by the radical SAM enzyme PqqE () with the help of PqqD () in the first step of PqqA modification. A protease then liberates the Glu-Tyr molecule from the peptide backbone. PqqB () oxidizes the 2 and 3 positions on the tyrosine ring, forming a quinone which quickly becomes AHQQ, finishing the pyridine ring. PqqC () then forms the final pyrrole ring.

Efforts to understand PQQ biosynthesis have contributed to broad interest in radical SAM enzymes and their ability to modify proteins, and an analogous radical SAM enzyme-dependent pathway has since been found that produces the putative electron carrier mycofactocin, using a valine and a tyrosine from the precursor peptide, MftA ().

== Role in proteins ==
Quinoproteins generally embed the cofactor in a unique, six-bladed beta-barrel structure. Some examples also have a heme C prosthetic group and are termed quinohemoproteins. Although quinoproteins are mostly found in bacteria, a &quot;Coprinopsis cinerea&quot; (fungus) pyranose dehydrogenase has been shown to use PQQ in its crystal structure.

PQQ also appears to be essential in some other eukaryotic proteins, albeit not as the direct electron carrier. The mammalian lactate dehydrogenase requires PQQ to run but uses NADH as the direct redox cofactor. It seems to speed up the reaction by catalyzing the oxidation of NADH via redox cycling.

== Controversy regarding role as vitamin ==
The scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published the 2003 paper by Kasahara and Kato that essentially stated that PQQ was a new vitamin and in 2005, an article by Anthony and Felton that stated that the 2003 Kasahara and Kato paper drew incorrect and unsubstantiated conclusions. An article by Bruce Ames in &quot;The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; in 2018 identified pyrroloquinoline quinone as a &quot;longevity vitamin&quot; not essential for immediate survival, but necessary for long-term health.

<text>John Macpherson Berrien (August 23, 1781January 1, 1856) was a United States senator from Georgia and Attorney General of the United States during the presidency of Andrew Jackson.

==Early life and education==
Berrien was born on August 23, 1781, at Rockingham, his parents&#x27; home in Rocky Hill, New Jersey. His father was Major John Berrien, son of Judge John Berrien, and his mother was Margaret Macpherson. The next year his parents moved with him to Savannah, Georgia, in 1782. His mother died three years later.

Berrien graduated from Princeton College in 1796, studied law (read the law) in Savannah, and was admitted to the bar at the age of 18. He moved to Louisville, Georgia, where he started a practice in 1799.

He returned to Savannah, where he was elected solicitor of the eastern judicial circuit of Georgia in 1809. He was elected as judge of the same circuit in 1810, serving until January 30, 1821, when he resigned. He served as captain of the Georgia Hussars, a Savannah volunteer company, in the War of 1812.

==Political career==

A leader among Georgia&#x27;s Federalists, Berrien supported Rufus King in the 1816 United States presidential election and later served a member of the Georgia Senate from 1822 to 1823. He was elected as a Jacksonian Democrat to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1825, succeeding his fellow Federalist John Elliott. In &quot;The Antelope&quot; case of 1824, he argued against the freedom of slaves captured at sea noting slavery &quot;lay at the foundation of the Constitution&quot; and that slaves &quot;constitute the very foundation of your union&quot;.

On March 9, 1829, he resigned from the Senate to accept the position of Attorney General in the Cabinet of President Andrew Jackson. His first assignment was to prosecute former Treasury Fourth Auditor Tobias Watkins for embezzlement of public funds. Berrien secured a conviction at a high profile trial that same year. Later Berrien supported states&#x27; rights in the Nullification Crisis. In the case of the Negro Seamen Acts, he considered the acts to be appropriate exercises of the states&#x27; police powers, and beyond the reach of the federal government. He resigned from the office of Attorney General on June 22, 1831.

After leaving the Cabinet he resumed the practice of law until he was again elected, as a Whig, to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1841, until May 1845, when he again resigned to accept an appointment to the supreme court of Georgia; again elected in 1845 to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by his second resignation; reelected in 1846 and served from November 13, 1845, until May 28, 1852, when he resigned for the third time.

Berrien&#x27;s views on sectional issues hardened during his tenure in the Senate and he became aligned with the short-lived Southern Rights Party formed to oppose the Compromise of 1850 and the Wilmot Proviso.

During the 1820s, Berrien was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which counted among its members presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions.

He served as the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in the 20th, 26th and 27th Congresses. He was president of the American Party convention at Milledgeville in 1855.

Berrien was a slaveholder, and owned 90 according to the 1830 U.S. census. In 1840, he owned eight slaves at his house in Savannah, Georgia, and an additional 140 slaves in surrounding Chatham County. In 1850, he owned 143 slaves.

==Death and legacy==
Berrien died at his home, now known as the John Berrien House (named for his father), in Savannah on January 1, 1856. He is interred in Laurel Grove Cemetery. Berrien County, Georgia, and Berrien County, Michigan (one of Michigan&#x27;s Cabinet Counties, organized during his term as attorney general), are named after him.

Berrien was one of the Georgia Historical Society&#x27;s founders in 1839 and served as the organization&#x27;s first president. The Georgia Historical Society holds a substantial collection of Berrien papers (including important material relating to the Petticoat affair). The Society also annually presents the John Macpherson Berrien Award, a lifetime achievement award recognizing outstanding contributions to Georgia history.

<text>Michael Wohlfahrt (; 1687–1741), also known as Michael Welfare, was an American religious leader who assisted Conrad Beissel in leading the Ephrata Community in Pennsylvania.

Wohlfahrt was born in Memel in the Duchy of Prussia (now Klaipėda in Lithuania), but emigrated to North America.

In 1725, he was baptised by Conrad Beissel, and when the Conestoga Brethren congregation suffered a schism, he strongly supported Beissel. After the foundation of the Ephrata Community in 1732, Wohlfahrt took the name &quot;Brother Agonius&quot; and assisted Beissel in running the community.

Welfare was an acquaintance of Benjamin Franklin who, in his autobiography, recounted that &quot;the Dunkers&quot; had been &quot;calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions&quot;. Franklin suggested publishing articles about their beliefs, to which Welfare had responded:

Franklin commented on this:

In 1985 Neil Postman drew another parallel by referring to a quote by Plato:

<doc id="619396" wikidata="Q544561" url="?curid=619396" title="George S. Boutwell">
<text>George Sewall Boutwell (January 28, 1818 – February 27, 1905) was an American politician, lawyer, and statesman from Massachusetts. He served as Secretary of the Treasury under President Ulysses S. Grant, the 20th governor of Massachusetts, a U.S. senator and representative from Massachusetts, and the first Commissioner of Internal Revenue under President Abraham Lincoln. He was a leader in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson and served as a House manager (prosecutor) in the impeachment trial.

Boutwell, an abolitionist, is known primarily for his leadership in the formation of the Republican Party, and his championship of African American citizenship and suffrage rights during Reconstruction. As a congressman, he was instrumental in the drafting and passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. As Secretary of the Treasury, he made needed reforms in the Treasury Department after the chaos of the American Civil War and the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson. He controversially reduced the national debt by selling Treasury gold and using greenbacks to buy up Treasury bonds, a process that created a cash shortage. Boutwell and President Grant thwarted an attempt to corner the gold market in September 1869 by releasing $4,000,000 (~$ in ) of gold into the economy. As a U.S. senator, Boutwell sponsored the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and was chair of a investigating white supremacist violence against Black citizens and their white Republican Party supporters during the 1875 Mississippi state election campaign.

In 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Boutwell commissioner to codify the &quot;Revised Statutes of the United States&quot; and in 1880 to serve as United States counsel before the French and American Claims Commission. He also practiced international law in other diplomatic fora. At the turn of the 20th century, he abandoned the Republican Party, opposed the acquisition of the Philippines, and in 1900 supported Democrat William Jennings Bryan for president.

In 2025, the &quot;first major biography&quot; (to quote its dust jacket) of Boutwell was published.

==Early life==
George S. Boutwell was born on January 28, 1818, in Brookline, Massachusetts. According to his autobiography, Boutwell was raised on his family&#x27;s farm in Lunenburg and attended public schools until the age of seventeen. During the summer months he worked barefooted, tending oxen and picking chestnuts. He studied arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and Latin grammar. From 1830 to 1835, Boutwell worked as an apprentice and clerk for Simeon Heywood, who owned a palm leaf hat store. He worked briefly as a teacher in Pound Hill, a nearby town, and finished his primary school education in February 1835.

From 1835 to 1838, Boutwell worked as a clerk and shopkeeper in Groton, Massachusetts. In 1836, he began to study law under attorney Bradford Russell, whose office was above the store where he clerked. Boutwell did not take the bar exam or practice law until many years later. In 1838, the shop owner offered Boutwell a partnership in the shop. While Boutwell ran the store, he began a personal regimen of reading and writing in an effort to make up for his decision not to attend college.

Boutwell made his public career debut in 1839 as a pension agent for widows of the American Revolutionary War, which had ended in 1783. He traveled to Washington, D.C., and was impressed by Daniel Webster. After talking with an enslaved Black woman whose youngest child had been sold to Louisiana, Boutwell became dedicated to the anti-slavery cause.

Boutwell married Sarah Adelia Thayer on July 8, 1841. She was the daughter of Nathan Thayer from Hollis, New Hampshire. They had two children: Georgianna (born May 18, 1843) and Francis (born February 26, 1847).

==Political career (1839–1861)==
Entering politics as a Democrat and a supporter of Martin Van Buren, Boutwell was appointed head of the Groton post office by his business partner, who had been appointed postmaster. Boutwell&#x27;s first entry into elective politics was a successful run for the Groton School Committee as a Temperance Party candidate; he sat on that committee for many years. The success prompted him to run for the state legislature on the same party&#x27;s ticket, but as the candidate of a small third party, he lost badly. In 1840, he won the Democratic Party nomination, despite temperance opinions that were &quot;offensive to many&quot;, but lost in a Whig landslide. He won on his third try, defeating incumbent John Boynton in 1841. He won the next two annual elections and lost in 1844 and 1845. He was returned to the state legislature in the 1846 election and served from 1847 to 1850. His elective successes, sometimes in the face of major Whig victories statewide, highlighted Boutwell&#x27;s potential, and brought him into the Democratic Party&#x27;s leadership circles. He sat on the judiciary and finance committees, where he gained a reputation for thorough research into legislation, and advocated positions favoring free trade, restraint of the money supply, and increased taxes for spending on education and other reforms. He supported the Mexican–American War, which, unlike other people at the time, he did not believe was motivated by a desire to expand slavery.

While in the state House of Representatives, Boutwell ran three times for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, losing by significant margins to his Whig opponents. In 1848, he was considered for the Democratic nomination for governor, placing third at the nominating convention. In 1849, he was appointed state banking commissioner by Whig Governor George N. Briggs, a position in which he inspected bank charters that were subject to renewal. In this position, he gained a wealth of experience in matters of banking and finance.

===Massachusetts Governor===

Throughout the 1840s, the issue of the abolition of slavery grew to become a significant force in Massachusetts politics. Outrage over the extension of slavery into territories acquired in the Mexican–American War increased the popularity of the Free Soil Party, but they and the Democrats were unable to unite to unseat the Whigs who dominated state politics until 1850. In 1849, Boutwell won the Democratic nomination for governor. Because no candidate won a majority, the Whig-controlled legislature decided the election, choosing the incumbent Briggs. The campaign brought Boutwell into close contact with Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson, leaders of the state Free Soil Party. The parties flirted with the idea of a coalition, with the Democrats adopting an antislavery platform.

In 1850, passage of the Compromise of 1850, in particular the Fugitive Slave Act, sparked further outrage, and the Democrats and Free Soilers were able to agree to a coalition. On the Democratic side, Boutwell and Nathaniel Prentice Banks agreed with Free Soilers Sumner and Wilson on a division of offices should the coalition win. The key to their success was control of the state legislature, which would decide the election if no gubernatorial candidate won a majority of the popular vote.

Both parties worked to bring out the vote in rural areas sympathetic to their cause. Although Governor Briggs won a plurality of the popular vote (57,000 out of 120,000 votes cast), he did not win a majority, and the legislature was controlled by the coalition. Pursuant to the terms of the deal, Boutwell was elected governor, Banks was made Speaker of the House, and Wilson was elected Senate President. Sumner&#x27;s election to the U.S. Senate, also part of the bargain, was contested by conservative Democrats, but the coalition eventually prevailed in electing him. Boutwell was criticized by Free Soilers for taking a hands-off approach to the contentious election of Sumner, neither supporting nor opposing him during the balloting in the state senate. Sumner later accused Boutwell of preventing a more permanent fusion of the two parties.

In the 1851 election, the results were similar, despite efforts by the Whigs to drive wedges between the coalition members, and Boutwell was again elected by the legislature after the Whig candidate won a plurality. That election exposed cracks in the coalition, principally on slavery. When Boutwell decided not stand for reelection in 1852, the Whigs regained control of the legislature and elected John H. Clifford to the governor&#x27;s chair.

On May 26, 1851, Boutwell was elected as a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts.

In Boutwell&#x27;s first term as governor, both houses of the legislature were controlled by the coalition, and its substantial reform agenda was enacted, including election by secret ballot, although the terms did not satisfy all of the secrecy rules of an Australian ballot, and plurality voting under some conditions. The state legislature&#x27;s seats were changed from town-based allocations to legislative districts that were not based on town boundaries. Laws governing the issuance of bank charters were streamlined, and the Harvard Board of Overseers was reorganized. Boutwell also engaged in a wholesale reassignment of patronage jobs in the state, which had all been filled with Whigs. In his second term, Whigs controlled the House of Representatives, and were thus able to thwart most of the reform agenda. Boutwell&#x27;s call to increase taxes for spending on education, prisons, and mental hospitals went unheeded, but the legislature was passed a call for a constitutional convention to discuss long-standing demands for changes to the state constitution. A &quot;Maine law&quot; temperance reform bill was also approved, but Boutwell was criticized by the Whigs for vetoing the first version of it and then signing the second, allegedly under pressure from Free Soilers.

===Constitutional Convention and Republican Party===
Boutwell was elected a delegate to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853. He opposed the election of judges and the abolition of the Governor&#x27;s Council, and supported the elimination of any poll tax requirements for voting. He served on the committee responsible for drafting the proposals that the Convention submitted to the voters for approval, and was disappointed when all of those proposals were rejected in the ensuing statewide referendum.
After the convention, Boutwell took up the study of law in the office of Joel Giles, a patent lawyer from Groton. He was retained by Middlesex County to oppose the formation of a new county out of parts of western Middlesex and northern Worcester Counties. He helped found the Groton Public Library, and continued to be active on the Groton School Committee. In 1855, he was appointed secretary of the state Board of Education, a post he held for five years. He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1862.

In the aftermath of the coalition breakup in 1852 and the failure of the 1853 convention, Massachusetts political parties broke down into factional interests. In August 1855, four major factions were holding meetings in a Boston hotel, attempting to find common ground for the upcoming state election. Boutwell convinced the groups to attend a grand meeting, at which he argued that they should form a &quot;union against slavery&quot;. Out of this and related activity the state&#x27;s Republican Party was born. Despite his role in its early formation, Boutwell remained somewhat apart from the organization because of his job at the Board of Education. He did however continue to speak out against slavery, noting that the nation was embarking on a &quot;period of intense trial&quot;, and that &quot;people will make war&quot; over slavery. In 1860 he chaired the Republican state convention and supported Republican candidates for office.

==Early Civil War years==
Boutwell attended the Peace Conference of 1861 in Washington, D.C., which attempted to prevent the impending Civil War, and served as a liaison between the federal government and Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew in April 1861. In the peace conference, he angrily rejected Southern proposals favoring the extension of slavery and its enforcement in northern states, arguing that &quot;the Union is not worth preserving&quot; if such measures are needed to do so.

In June and July 1862, Boutwell served on a military commission in the Department of War, investigating irregularities in the quartermaster&#x27;s department of General John C. Frémont, who commanded the Union Army&#x27;s Department of the West. Assistant Quartermaster Reuben Hatch, whose brother was a political supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, had been defrauding the department, and the commission was established on Lincoln&#x27;s order to forestall a court martial. Boutwell spent two months in the army camp at Cairo, Illinois, under conditions he described as &quot;disagreeable to an extent that cannot be realized easily&quot; because of flooding and unsanitary conditions. The commission cleared Hatch.

In July 1862, while he was still in Cairo, Boutwell was appointed the first Commissioner of Internal Revenue by President Lincoln. He spent his eight months in that post organizing the new Internal Revenue Bureau. He oversaw the growth of the bureau to some 4,000 employees, the largest department in the government, and Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase praised him for having the &quot;highest obtainable ability and integrity&quot;.

Boutwell decided in 1862 to run for the United States Congress. The campaign was dominated by the issue of emancipation, which Boutwell strongly advocated. He won a comfortable (55–40%) victory over Charles R. Train, a conservative former Republican. He resigned as internal revenue commissioner in March 1863 to take his seat in the U.S. House.

==U.S. Congressman==
Boutwell came to the House of Representatives already celebrated for his financial expertise, and quickly gained a national reputation as a Radical Republican. A reporter noted that with his first day of service on a committee, he became recognized as one of the most promising freshmen. He wrote:
===African American civil rights===
In July 1862, during a period when Northern antipathy toward the possibility that formerly enslaved Blacks might migrate to the North was at its height, Boutwell gave a speech on the Capitol grounds in which he advocated freedom for African American slaves because it would keep them out of the North. He even urged Lincoln to dedicate the states of South Carolina and Florida for American Blacks: &quot;I have heard that in the city of Brooklyn...there was a riot between the free white laborers and colored men...What is the solution to this difficulty?...Freedom to the blacks. Then will they go from the North to the free territories of the South, to which by nature they belong. [Lincoln] should have made South Carolina and Florida free... I would praise God ... if to-night I could hear, by the President&#x27;s proclamation, that South Carolina and Florida were free and dedicated to the black population of the country. The competition with the white laborers of the North would cease.&quot;

On July 4, 1865, after the Civil War ended, Boutwell gave a speech that advocated African American suffrage, echoing Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s principal view from the Declaration of Independence that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot; He envisioned the postwar United States as a nation of equality where both whites and blacks could have the vote side by side, and believed that African American suffrage would secure the nation as well as protect African Americans.

Boutwell served on the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which framed the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave African American freedmen citizenship and established the inviolability of the United States public debt. He advocated for the Fifteenth Amendment, which gave full suffrage rights to African American men. &quot;Mr. Boutwell is the last survivor of the Puritans of a bygone age,&quot; the French reporter Georges Clemenceau wrote, &quot;a man after the heart of John Bunyan, too much of a fanatic to command the attention of the Senate, but too honest and sincere for his opinions to be ignored by his party.&quot;

===Impeachment of Andrew Johnson===
Boutwell opposed the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson from the first weeks of his administration. Arguing that any remaking of the former Confederate governments must begin with steps to open the electorate to Blacks as well as whites, he warned that Black rights and loyal Unionists&#x27; safety could be protected in no other way. In time, he turned into one of the most militant advocates of Johnson&#x27;s impeachment, and by far the most respected of them. Unlike his colleagues, a hostile observer wrote, he brought to the cause &quot;the advantage of a cultivated mind, an extensive reading and a scholarly acquaintance with all of history that could be mustered into such a service&quot;.

Serving on the House Committee on the Judiciary, he supported impeaching Johnson in the first impeachment inquiry against Andrew Johnson, a position the committee endorsed on January 25, 1867. In December 1867, he made the case to the full House for impeaching the president without charging him with having committed actual crimes – contending, in effect, that impeachment was a political, and not just a judicial process. He did not expect impeachment to pass and did not foresee the Senate convicting Johnson; rather he hoped for a statement from the House that the president had committed high crimes and misdemeanors, in effect a resolution of censure). The House overwhelmingly voted against impeachment.

Boutwell was a member of the House Select Committee on Reconstruction, which oversaw the second impeachment inquiry against Andrew Johnson beginning in late-January 1868. In February 1868, Johnson&#x27;s removal of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton in contravention of Tenure of Office Act, which Stanton and Boutwell had drafted, united Republicans behind a resolution of impeachment, and Johnson was impeached, with Boutwell playing a role. After John Covode presented an impeachment resolution to the House on February 21, 1868, Boutwell successfully motioned that the resolution be referred to the House Committee on Reconstruction. In the morning of February 22, 1868, Boutwell and the other six Republicans on the committee voted in a party-line vote of 7–2 to refer a slightly amended version of Covode&#x27;s impeachment resolution to the full House, and the amended resolution was presented to the House later that day. Boutwell voted to impeach Johnson when the House successfully impeached him on February 24, 1868.

After the impeachment resolution passed, Boutwell chaired the committee created to draft specific articles of impeachment, and presented the articles to the House for debate. He was thereafter chosen as one of the managers of the impeachment trial proceedings that followed. The bulk of the trial work was handled by fellow Massachusetts Congressman Benjamin F. Butler, although all seven managers were involved in developing the case against Johnson. Boutwell was given the honor of giving the first closing speech (all seven managers, and five defense lawyers, spoke). His speech was not particularly notable for its rhetoric, but defense lawyer William Evarts seized on Boutwell&#x27;s strained analogy of casting Johnson into deep space to provoke significant laughter and applause. The impeachment failed by a single vote.

Boutwell was given serious consideration for a place in the cabinet of President-elect Ulysses S. Grant, and is reported to have declined the Interior Department. Within a week of the inauguration in 1869, Grant&#x27;s first choice for the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander T. Stewart, could not win Senate confirmation. Republicans on Capitol Hill, feeling that the cabinet lacked members who combined Washington experience with solid party credentials, urged Grant to nominate Boutwell, and, tendered the Treasury portfolio, Boutwell accepted. The business community hailed Boutwell&#x27;s selection. The news of his appointment created an immediate jump in the price of government bonds. &quot;Nor is this to be wondered at,&quot; the &quot;Commercial and Financial Chronicle&quot; commented, &quot;for Mr. Boutwell is well known as an earnest advocate of conservative financial reform. That he is an able administrative officer he gave conspicuous proofs when in 1862 he was entrusted with the organization of the new Internal Revenue Bureau.&quot; Boutwell, at that time popular for his two impeachment attempts of President Johnson, was easily confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. At Treasury, Boutwell often acted independently of President Grant and took on a haughty attitude toward other Cabinet members. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish noted that Boutwell was frequently evasive, noncommittal, and gave &quot;no reasons, and rarely indicates or explains anything of his policy&quot;.
===Reforms (1869)===
After the chaos of the Civil War, the Treasury Department was disorganized and needed reform. The controversy between President Johnson over Reconstruction and the impeachment trial in the Senate in 1868 forestalled any reforms in the Treasury Department. As Treasury Secretary, Boutwell&#x27;s primary achievements were reorganizing and reforming the Treasury Department, improving bookkeeping by customs houses, incorporating the United States Mint into the Treasury and reducing the national debt.

===Gold panic (1869)===
In line with the Republican Party national platform of 1868, Boutwell advocated reducing the national debt and the return of the nation&#x27;s economy to one based on gold. Boutwell believed that the stabilization of the currency and the reduction of the national debt was more important than risking a depression by withdrawing paper currency (greenbacks) from circulation. Without the approval or knowledge of President Grant or other Cabinet members, Boutwell began to release gold from the Treasury and sell government bonds, in order to reduce the supply of paper currency. As a result gold prices declined and the national debt was reduced. However, it also created a deflationary economy, in which farmers had trouble obtaining needed cash to pay for their farming activity.

During the summer of 1869, gold speculators Jay Gould and James Fisk plotted to corner the gold market by buying gold and influencing Grant to stop Boutwell&#x27;s gold releases. Gould and Fisk initially told Grant that a higher gold price would help farmers sell more goods overseas, but Grant was not convinced. When harvests were reported to be good, Grant changed his mind and ordered Boutwell to stop releasing gold at the beginning of September 1869. Gould successfully maneuvered an informant, Daniel Butterfield, into a post as assistant to Boutwell and began buying gold in earnest, sending the price up. Grant was alerted to the attempt to corner the market by a courier-delivered letter from his brother-in-law Abel Corbin, who was in the gold ring, urging that the government refrain from selling gold. Grant met with Boutwell on September 22, and they decided the government should step in. On September 23, 1869, the Gold Panic reached its climax: Boutwell ordered the release of $4 million (~$ in ) of Treasury gold, but not before Gould, alerted via First Lady Julia Grant and Corbin, had managed to sell off some of his holdings. The price rapidly dropped from $160 to $135, creating panic among gold speculators. Brokerage houses were bankrupted and personal fortunes were lost, and the stock market was skittish for a year afterward. An investigation by Congress headed by Representative James A. Garfield exonerated both Grant and Boutwell in 1870. Boutwell&#x27;s assistant, Daniel Butterfield, was fired by Grant for releasing inside information to Gould concerning the Treasury Department&#x27;s releases of gold.

===National debt (1870)===
Boutwell opposed a rapid lowering of taxes and favored using surplus revenues to make a large reduction in the national debt. At his recommendation, Congress in 1870 passed an act providing for the funding of the national debt and authorizing the sale of certain bonds, but did not authorize an increase in the debt. In order to implement the restrictive law, Boutwell set up a banking syndicate to buy newly issued bonds at 4% and 5% in order to pay back Civil War bonds initially sold at 6%; that would alleviate the national debt. In order to implement the banking syndicate, Boutwell had to temporarily raise the national debt more than half of one per cent, for which he was accused of technically violating the law. The House Committee of Ways and Means later absolved him of this charge.

Boutwell had sought to finance some of the debt reduction through the placement of loans in Europe. This idea was complicated by Civil War claims against the United Kingdom, the so-called &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims resulting from the construction of CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and other Confederate privateers in British ports, and then by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War shortly after the financing bill was passed. The latter prevented placement of offers in mainland Europe&#x27;s financial centers, and the unresolved &quot;Alabama&quot; issues prevented their placement in London. Political pressure on both sides of the Atlantic resulted in the 1871 Treaty of Washington, after which Boutwell floated a loan in London. The first loan offer unravelled, however, because Boutwell offered it to too many banks, but a second, reorganized attempt led by financier Jay Cooke succeeded in raising over $100 million. It was the first time an American bank successfully engaged in this type of international transaction.

===Ku Klux Klan bill (1871)===

Boutwell did not forget the plight of African Americans in the South who were subject to violence perpetrated by white Southerners, particularly the Ku Klux Klan. African Americans and loyal white Republicans were under attack in several Reconstructed states by the Klan. Congress responded, under the leadership of Benjamin Butler in the House of Representatives, and passed what was known as the Ku Klux Klan Act in 1871. Grant had signed two previous &quot;force bills&quot; to protect African Americans and having found that violence in the South continued to be rampant he decided to sign the third force bill that gave the President the power to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Grant was initially reluctant to sign the bill, fearing he would acquire a reputation as a military dictator in the South. However, Boutwell encouraged Grant to sign the bill, pointing out the many violent atrocities taking place in the South. Grant promoted passage of the bill, and then signed it into law. He used the law to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in nine South Carolina counties and ordered the arrest and prosecution of Klan members.

==U.S. Senator==
In 1873, when Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson was elected to the vice presidency, Boutwell announced his intention to resign as Treasury Secretary, and made himself a candidate for the Senate vacancy. With support from Benjamin Butler and federal appointees working for Butler&#x27;s machine, Boutwell defeated the candidate from the western end of the state, moderate Congressman Henry Laurens Dawes. A major campaign issue between Boutwell and Dawes was the Crédit Mobilier scandal, in which both Boutwell and Dawes were accused of receiving undervalued stock from Congressman and financier Oakes Ames. Both men had received shares, but Dawes returned his along with most of the realized profits. Butler&#x27;s support for Boutwell was also disliked by the Massachusetts Republican establishment, which had come to despise Butler&#x27;s tactics and politics.

Butler, who was hoping to run for governor in the fall of 1873, assumed that he could count on Boutwell&#x27;s support, but as senator Boutwell refused to involve himself in the governor&#x27;s race, and Butler was beaten for the Republican nomination after a bitter campaign. The following winter, Grant nominated Butler&#x27;s ally William Simmons for the Collectorship of the Port of Boston, the most powerful federal patronage position in Massachusetts. Boutwell at first promised to fight it and then yielded to pressure from the Grant administration and Simmons was confirmed. This deal guaranteed that Massachusetts Republicans most opposed to Butler and what they called &quot;Butlerism&quot; would prevent Boutwell from being re-elected in 1877.

In the Senate, Boutwell served as chairman of the Committee on the Revision of the Laws in the 44th Congress. He took a strong stand for &quot;honest money&quot;, a currency not reflated with paper money, and voted against the so-called Inflation Bill of 1874. He also remained a strong supporter of federal protection for Black voters in the South, backing the 1875 Civil Rights Law, which banned discrimination by common carriers and in public accommodations. He also favored high tariffs, a position of mixed favor in Massachusetts, which had some dependence on imports but also exported manufactured goods.

Boutwell was appointed in 1876 to head a special Senate committee to investigate the Mississippi elections of 1875. These elections were accompanied by significant orchestrated violence aimed at preventing African Americans from voting, and resulted in the return of Democrats to power there. Boutwell&#x27;s commission documented the violence and atrocities that took place, but no federal action was taken to prevent a recurrence in the 1876 elections.

==Later career==
After Boutwell left the Senate, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed him in 1877 to prepare an updated edition of the &quot;Revised Statutes of the United States&quot;. This work entailed updating the law books to reflect changes made since 1873; Boutwell also reflected changes to the laws implied by all of the United States Supreme Court decisions to date. The updated work was published in 1878.

During the 1880s and 1890s Boutwell practiced international and patent law from offices in Boston and Washington, D.C. His business included working for the United States and other national governments as counsel to several bilateral diplomatic commissions. In the first, running from 1880 to 1884, he represented the US in regard to claims involving France which mostly emanated from the Civil War. He next served as counsel for Haiti (1885), and then again for the US on a commission with Chile (1893–94), which addressed claims against both governments most of whose origins were in either the War of the Pacific or the Chilean Civil War of 1891. In 1881, Boutwell declined to serve as Secretary of the Treasury under President Chester A. Arthur. He served for a time as a legal representative for the Kingdom of Hawaii, whose acquisition by the US he opposed.

In the late 1890s, Boutwell became increasingly disenchanted with the imperialist foreign policy of President William McKinley and left the Republican Party after the annexation of the Philippines following the 1898 Spanish–American War. He was a founder and the first president of the American Anti-Imperialist League, an organization opposed to American expansion. He campaigned against McKinley in 1900 and was a presidential elector for the Democratic ticket of William Jennings Bryan. He promoted Philippine independence until his death.

==Death==

Boutwell died in Groton on February 27, 1905, and is buried at Groton Cemetery. He was memorialized in a major celebration at Faneuil Hall, Boston, on April 18, 1905. His house in the center of Groton, built in 1851 while he was governor, was given to the Groton Historical Society by his daughter, Georgianna. It now serves as the society&#x27;s headquarters and is open in the summer as a museum. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Gov. George S. Boutwell House.

<doc id="619407" wikidata="Q1346932" url="?curid=619407" title="Madison Avenue (band)">
<text>Madison Avenue were an Australian electronic music duo consisting of writer-producer Andy Van Dorsselaer and singer-lyricist Cheyne Coates. Madison Avenue is best known for the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; (October 1999), which peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart in 1999 and topped the charts in New Zealand and the United Kingdom in 2000. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 they won Single of the Year, Highest Selling Single and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; as well as Best Video for Mark Hartley&#x27;s direction of &quot;Who the Hell Are You&quot;.

==History==
Before joining Madison Avenue, Cheyne Coates was working as a choreographer and singer in Melbourne. Coates met producer and writer Andy Van Dorsselaer (aka Andy Van) in a dance club. Van was the founder of the Vicious Vinyl record label and had remix credits for Tina Arena and CDB. Van Dorsselaer had won an Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) award for his production work on &quot;Coma&quot; by Pendulum.

The duo started working together mainly as writers and producers in 1998. Madison Avenue recorded their first single, &quot;Fly&quot;, featuring Kellie Wolfgram as lead vocalist. Coates sang lead on the group&#x27;s breakthrough single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; (October 1999): Van Dorsselaer preferred her version, even though it was initially used as the guide track for Wolfgram. &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart in 1999. By December 2000 it was certified as triple platinum for the shipment of 210,000 units in Australia. The single was released internationally in 2000. In New Zealand, &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; topped the New Zealand Singles Chart in April 2000. In the United Kingdom, the single topped the UK Singles Chart in May 2000, selling 400,000 copies in Britain. &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; became the first single by an Australian group to top the charts in Britain since &quot;Down Under&quot; by Men at Work in February 1983, a feat it maintained for ten years until &quot;We No Speak Americano&quot; by Yolanda Be Cool and DCUP topped the UK Singles Chart in July 2010. The song was also a top ten hit in Greece and Ireland. Coates became the public face of the band, although they had intended to be a collective dance group like C&amp;C Music Factory or Soul II Soul.

The group&#x27;s only studio album, &quot;The Polyester Embassy&quot;, was released in 2000 and reached number 4 on the Australian album charts. It provided three other singles: &quot;Who the Hell Are You?&quot;, a number-one hit in Australia, &quot;Everything You Need&quot;, and &quot;Reminiscing&quot;, a cover version of the 1978 hit written by Graeham Goble for the Little River Band. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 they won Single of the Year, Highest Selling Single and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot; as well as Best Video for Mark Hartley&#x27;s direction of &quot;Who the Hell Are You&quot;. They were also nominated for Best Group, Best Dance Release, Producer of the Year (for work by Van Dorsselaer and Coates) and Best Video (for direction by Hartley) for &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Baby&quot;. Madison Avenue won the Best Dance Artist award at the International Dance Awards in 2001 in Miami.

Madison Avenue broke up in 2003. In April 2004, Coates issued her debut solo single, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Your Number&quot;. She followed with a solo album, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; (October 2004). Soon after, she left the music performance industry and, according to Van Dorseelaer, &quot;has a successful career writing songs for other people.&quot; Andy Van went on to create the band Vandalism.

<text>Loten&#x27;s sunbird (Cinnyris lotenius), also known as the long-billed sunbird or maroon-breasted sunbird, is a sunbird endemic to peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Named after Joan Gideon Loten, who was the Dutch governor of colonial Ceylon, it is very similar to the purple sunbird that is found in the same areas and also tends to hover at flowers for nectar, but can be distinguished by the longer bill, the maroon band on the breast and brownish wings. Like other sunbirds, it is also insectivorous and builds characteristic hanging nests.

==Description==

Loten&#x27;s sunbirds are small, only 12–13 cm long. The long bill separates this from the syntopic purple sunbird. The wings are browner and the maroon breast band is visible on the male under good lighting conditions. The males have of yellow mixed with crimson that are used in displays. The adult male is mainly glossy purple with a grey-brown belly. The female has yellow-grey upperparts and yellowish underparts, but lacks the purple&#x27;s faint supercilium. The call is distinctive buzzy &quot;zwick zwick&quot; and they are also very active often bobbing their head while foraging. They long down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, are adaptations to their nectar feeding. The bill lengths vary across populations with the longest bills are found on the east of Peninsular India and in Sri Lanka. The song of the male is a long repeated &quot;wue-wue-wue...&quot; with the last notes accelerated. The song has been likened to the call of the cinereous tit. The males may sing from the tops of bare trees or telegraph wires.

The male in winter has an eclipse plumage with a yellowish underside resembling that of the female but having a broad central streak of dark metallic violet from the chin to the belly. The existence of an eclipse plumage in the adult male has been questioned by Rasmussen &amp; Anderton (2005) due to the lack of specimens in evidence. Jerdon noted however that:
==Taxonomy==

The name of the bird commemorates Joan Gideon Loten, the Dutch governor to Sri Lanka (Ceylon) who commissioned the artist Pieter Cornelis de Bevere to illustrate the natural history of the region from living and collected specimens. The plates by de Bevere included illustrations of many bird species and when Loten went back to England, he loaned these to various naturalists including George Edwards (1694–1773) who used them his &quot;Gleanings of Natural History&quot;. Carl Linnaeus described this species under the genus &quot;Certhia&quot; based on material obtained from Loten.

Gmelin confused this with African species and many publications of that time include inaccurate information:
==Distribution and habitat==

Found only in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. The main region is along the Western Ghats and into the southern peninsula. There are scattered records from central India and into the northern Eastern Ghats north until Orissa. Race &quot;hindustanicus&quot;, southern Peninsular populations of which have a slightly shorter bill, is found in India while the nominate race is found in Sri Lanka. They are locally common in both forests, cultivation. They are also common in urban gardens and in some areas such as the city of Madras, they are commoner than other sunbirds.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The species is resident and no seasonal movements are known. While foraging for nectar they hover at flowers a lot unlike the purple sunbirds that prefers to perch beside flowers. Like other sunbirds, they also feed on small insects and spiders. It drinks from many garden plants as readily as wilder shrubs.

The breeding season is November to March in India, February to May in Sri Lanka. The nest is built by the female which may however be accompanied by the male. Two eggs are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. The eggs are incubated only by the female for about 15 days. The nest is a bag of webs, bark and caterpillar frass. The nest is built by the female and young are fed by both parents. Nests may sometimes be reused for a second brood. It often builds its nest within the nests of &quot;social spiders&quot; (Eresidae).

Salim Ali notes that the species is exceptional among Indian sunbirds in not having cobwebs on the exterior. It usually lays 2 eggs, but very. rarely three, which are of a long ovoid shape. These eggs grayish-white, with streak-like spots of greyish brown, occasionally with green and purple tints. Sometimes more marks are found on the thick end.

<text>Alan King (born Irwin Alan Kniberg; December 26, 1927 – May 9, 2004) was an American comedian, actor and satirist known for his biting wit and often angry humorous rants. He was also a serious actor who appeared in a number of films and television shows. King wrote several books, produced films, and appeared in plays. In his later years, he helped many philanthropic causes.

== Early life ==
King was born in New York City, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants Minnie (née Solomon) and Bernard Kniberg, a handbag cutter. He had one older sister, Anita Kniberg. He spent his first years on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Later, King&#x27;s family moved to Brooklyn. King used humor to survive the tough neighborhoods, and performed impersonations on street corners for pennies.

When he was 14, King performed &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; on the radio program &quot;Major Bowes Amateur Hour&quot;. He lost first prize, but was invited to join a nationwide tour. At 15, King dropped out of high school to perform comedy at the Hotel Gradus in the Catskill Mountains. After one joke that made fun of the hotel&#x27;s owner, he was fired, but he spent the remainder of that summer and the one that followed as emcee at Forman&#x27;s New Prospect Hotel in Mountaindale, New York. He later worked in Canada in a burlesque house while also fighting as a professional boxer; he won 20 straight bouts . Nursing a broken nose, King decided to quit boxing and focus on comedy. He worked as a doorman at the popular nightclub Leon and Eddie&#x27;s, while performing comedy under the last name of the boxer who beat him, King.

== Career ==

King began his comedy career with one-liner routines and other material concerning mothers-in-law and Jews. His style of comedy changed when he saw Danny Thomas in the early 1950s. King realized that Thomas was speaking to his audience, not at them, and was getting a better response. King changed his own style from one-liners to a more conversational style that used everyday life for humor.

His wife had persuaded the New Yorker to forsake Manhattan for suburban Forest Hills, Queens. In the 1950s, his family and he lived in Rockville Centre, New York, and later in Kings Point, Long Island, where he lived for the rest of his life. There, he developed comedy revolving around life in suburbia. With many Americans moving to the suburbs, King&#x27;s humor took hold.
Like many other Jewish comics, King worked the Catskill circuit known as the Borscht Belt.

He was soon opening for Judy Garland, Patti Page, Nat King Cole, Billy Eckstine, Lena Horne, and Tony Martin. When Martin was cast in the movie &quot;Hit the Deck&quot;, he got King his first movie role. 
He played small roles in movies in the 1950s, but disliked stereotypical roles that he described as &quot;always the sergeant from Brooklyn named Kowalski.&quot; Typical of this was his role as Sgt Buzzer in the WW2 film On the Fiddle (1961).

His career took off after appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Perry Como Show,&quot; and &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;.

He emceed President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inauguration in 1961.

Living just outside New York City, King was frequently available when Ed Sullivan needed a short-notice fill-in. He became a regular guest host for &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

He hosted the Oscars in 1972.

He headlined two unsold television pilots on CBS, both titled &quot;The Alan King Show&quot;. The first aired on September 8, 1961; the second aired on July 12, 1986.

King eventually expanded his range and made a name for himself in a wide variety of films. He frequently worked for director Sidney Lumet, beginning with &quot;Bye Bye Braverman&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot; (1971). Lumet later cast him in a starring role in &quot;Just Tell Me What You Want&quot; (1980), a provocative comedy about a ruthless business mogul and his TV-producer mistress (Ali MacGraw). He also played in an uncredited cameo in Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981).

He often portrayed gangsters, as in &quot;I, the Jury&quot; (1982) and &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1985). He had another major role in &quot;Memories of Me&quot; (1988) as the so-called &quot;king of the Hollywood extras&quot;, portraying Billy Crystal&#x27;s terminally ill father. King played the role of corrupt union official Andy Stone in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Casino&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Night and the City&quot; (1992), also starring Robert De Niro.

King was the long-standing host of the New York Friars Club celebrity roasts and served as the club&#x27;s historian.

King was the first recipient (1988) of the award for American Jewish humor from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. The award was ultimately named in his honor.
He inspired other comedians, including Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, Billy Crystal, Robert Klein, and Bill Cosby.

== Personal life ==

King married Jeanette Sprung in 1947. They had three children: Andrew, Robert, and Elainie Ray. His wife persuaded him to move to Forest Hills, Queens, for their children&#x27;s sake. In the 1950s, his family and he lived in Rockville Centre, New York, and later in Kings Point, Long Island, where he lived for the rest of his life.
Throughout his life, King was deeply involved in charity work. He founded the Alan King Medical Center in Jerusalem, raised funds for the Nassau Center for Emotionally Disturbed Children (near his home in Kings Point, New York), and established a chair in dramatic arts at Brandeis University. He also created the Laugh Well program, which sends comedians to hospitals to perform for patients. In the 1970s, King turned his passion for tennis into a professional tournament at Caesars Palace Las Vegas called the Alan King Tennis Classic, which was aired nationally on the TVS Television Network. He also created the Toyota Comedy Festival.

===Death===
King, who smoked cigars heavily (a fact that came up in his routines from time to time), died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan on May 9, 2004, from lung cancer. He was buried in Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, Queens. The film &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; was dedicated to his memory. He is also recognized in the end credits of &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;.

<doc id="619442" wikidata="Q388209" url="?curid=619442" title="Venule">
<text>A venule is a very small vein in the microcirculation that allows blood to return from the capillary beds to drain into the venous system via increasingly larger veins. Post-capillary venules are the smallest of the veins with a diameter of between 10 and 30 micrometres (μm). When the post-capillary venules increase in diameter to 50μm they can incorporate smooth muscle and are known as muscular venules. Veins contain approximately 70% of total blood volume, while about 25% is contained in the venules. Many venules unite to form a vein.

==Structure==

Post-capillary venules have a single layer of endothelium surrounded by a basal lamina. Their size is between 10 and 30 micrometers and are too small to contain smooth muscle. They are instead supported by pericytes that wrap around them. When the post-capillary venules increase in diameter to 50μm they can incorporate smooth muscle and are known as muscular venules. They have an inner endothelium composed of squamous endothelial cells that act as a membrane, a middle layer of muscle and elastic tissue and an outer layer of fibrous connective tissue. The middle layer is poorly developed so that venules have thinner walls than arterioles. They are porous so that fluid and blood cells can move easily from the bloodstream through their walls.

Short portal venules between the posterior pituitary and the anterior pituitary lobes provide an avenue for rapid hormonal exchange via the blood. Specifically within and between the pituitary lobes is anatomical evidence for confluent interlobe venules providing blood from the anterior to the neural lobe that would facilitate moment-to-moment sharing of information between lobes of the pituitary gland.

In contrast to regular venules, high endothelial venules are a special type of venule where the endothelium is made up of simple cuboidal cells. Lymphocytes exit the blood stream and enter the lymph nodes via these specialized venules when an infection is detected. Compared with arterioles, the venules are larger with much weaker muscular coat. They are the smallest united common branch in the human body.

<text>Simon Dach (29 July 1605 – 15 April 1659) was a German lyrical poet and hymnwriter, born in Memel, Duchy of Prussia (now Klaipėda in Lithuania).

== Early life ==
Although brought up in humble circumstances (his father was a poorly paid court interpreter for Lithuanian in Memel), he received a classical education in the Domschule of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) and in the Latin schools of Wittenberg and Magdeburg, and entered the University of Königsberg in 1626 where he was a student of theology and philosophy. In 1626, he left Magdeburg to escape both the plague and the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and returned to his Prussian homeland, settling in Königsberg, where he remained for the rest of his life.

== Mid life ==
After earning his degree, Dach was a private tutor for a time, then was appointed &quot;Kollaborator&quot; (teacher) in 1633 and co-rector of the &quot;Domschule&quot; (cathedral school) in Königsberg in 1636. In 1639 he was appointed by Adrian Brauer to the Chair of Poetry at the Albertina University in Königsberg. This was a post he held until his death. Also, in 1640 he received a doctorate from the University.

Part of his official duties as Chair of Poetry was to create poems for various University celebrations, programs, debates and funeral services of his colleagues – all of these written either Latin or Greek. In 1644, he wrote the play &quot;Sorbuisa&quot;, which celebrated the centennial of the University of Königsberg.

Dach became one of the prominent heads of the musical Kürbishütte, a group that included, among others, George Weissel, Valentin Thilo, and Johann Franck. The summer-house of organist and composer Heinrich Albert became the meeting place of this group of poets, hymnists and musicians, who met in to create new hymns as well as to give readings of their own poetry. This group published eight books of poems and songs from 1638 to 1650, the books meeting with great success. Of the approximately 200 poems and songs contained within the books, Dach had the lion&#x27;s share, with 125 being his compositions. The songs and hymns contained in these books, especially those of Dach, were sung throughout Germany and frequently appeared in pirated editions.

== Later life and poetic success ==
In Königsberg he became friends with and collaborated with Heinrich Albert (1604–1651) and Robert Roberthin (1600–1648) and with them formed the &quot;Königsberger Dichtergruppe&quot; (loosely translated as the &quot;Königsberg Poets&#x27; Association&quot;). In 1639 he was appointed professor of poetry at Königsberg through the influence of his friend Roberthin. He sang the praises of the house of the Electors of Brandenburg in a collection of poems entitled &quot;Kurbrandenburgische Rose, Adler, Lowe und Scepter&quot; (1661), and also produced many occasional poems, several of which became popular; the most famous of them is &quot;Anke von Tharaw öss, de my geföllt&quot; &quot;Anke van Tharaw&quot; (rendered from Low Saxon by Herder into Standard German as &quot;Ännchen von Tharau&quot;), composed in 1637 in honor of the marriage of a friend.

Among Dach&#x27;s best-known hymns, many of which are still sung, are the following: &quot;Ich bin ja, Herr, in deiner Macht&quot;, &quot;Ich bin bei Gott in Gnaden durch Christi Blut und Tod&quot;, and &quot;O, wie selig seid ihr doch, ihr Frommen.&quot; In all, he wrote over 150 hymns, and a number of poems, and was considered the leading figure of the hymnists and poets of Königsberg.

<text>Internal bleeding (also called internal haemorrhage) is a loss of blood from a blood vessel that collects inside the body, and is not usually visible from the outside. It can be a serious medical emergency but the extent of severity depends on bleeding rate and location of the bleeding (e.g. head, torso, extremities). Severe internal bleeding into the chest, abdomen, pelvis, or thighs can cause hemorrhagic shock or death if proper medical treatment is not received quickly. Internal bleeding is a medical emergency and should be treated immediately by medical professionals.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of internal bleeding may vary based on location, presence of injury or trauma, and severity of bleeding. Common symptoms of blood loss may include: 

* Lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Urinating less than usual
* Confusion
* Fast heart rate
* Pale and/or cold skin
* Thirst
* Generalized weakness

Visible signs of internal bleeding include:

* Blood in the urine
* Dark black stools
* Bright red stools
* Bloody noses
* Bruising
* Throwing up blood

Of note, it is possible to have internal bleeding without any of the above symptoms, and pain may or may not be present.

A patient may lose more than 30% of their blood volume before there are changes in their vital signs or level of consciousness. This is called hemorrhagic or hypovolemic shock, which is a type of shock that occurs when there is not enough blood to reach organs in the body.

== Causes ==
Internal bleeding can be caused by a broad number of things. We can break these up into three large categories: 

* Trauma, or direct injury to blood vessels within the body cavity
* Genetic and acquired conditions, along with various medications, that result in an increased bleeding risk
* Other

===Traumatic===

The most common cause of death in trauma is bleeding. Death from trauma accounts for 1.5 million of the 1.9 million deaths per year due to bleeding. 

There are two types of trauma: penetrating trauma and blunt trauma.

* Penetrating trauma is the most common cause of vascular injury and can result in internal bleeding. It can occur after a ballistic injury or stab wound. If penetrating trauma occurs in blood vessels close to the heart, it can quickly lead to hemorrhagic or hypovolemic shock, exsanguination, and death.
* Blunt trauma is another cause of vascular injury that can result in internal bleeding. It can occur after a high speed deceleration in an automobile accident.

===Non-traumatic===

A number of pathological conditions and diseases can lead to internal bleeding. These include:

* Blood vessel rupture as a result of high blood pressure, aneurysms, peptic ulcers, or ectopic pregnancy. 
* Other diseases linked to internal bleeding include cancer, hematologic disease, Vitamin K deficiency, and rare viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as the Ebola, Dengue or Marburg viruses.

===Other===

Internal bleeding could be a result of complications following surgery or other medical procedures. Some medications may also increase a person&#x27;s risk for bleeding, such as anticoagulant drugs or antiplatelet drugs in the treatment of coronary artery disease.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Vital signs ===
Blood loss can be estimated based on heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and mental status. Blood is circulated throughout the body and all major organ systems through a closed loop system. When there is damage to the blood vessel or the blood is thinner than the physiologic consistency, blood can exit the vessel which disrupts this close-looped system. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) responds in two large ways as an attempt to compensate for the opening in the system. These two actions are easily monitored by checking the heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure will initially decrease due to the loss of blood. This is where the ANS comes in and attempts to compensate by contracting the muscles that surround these vessels. As a result, a person who is bleeding internally may initially have a normal blood pressure. When the blood pressure falls below the normal range, this is called hypotension. The heart will start to pump faster causing the heart rate to increase, as an attempt to get blood delivered to vital organ systems faster. When the heart beats faster than the healthy and normal range, this is called tachycardia. If the bleeding is not controlled or stopped, a patient will experience tachycardia and hypotension, which altogether is a state of shock, called hemorrhagic shock.

Advanced trauma life support (ATLS) by the American College of Surgeons separates hemorrhagic shock into four categories.

Assessing circulation occurs after assessing the patient&#x27;s airway and breathing (ABC (medicine)). If internal bleeding is suspected, a patient&#x27;s circulatory system is assessed through palpation of pulses and doppler ultrasonography.

=== Physical examination ===
It is important to examine the person for visible signs that may suggest the presence of internal bleeding and/or the source of the bleed. Some of these signs may include:

* a wound
* bruising [ecchymosis]
* blood collection [hematoma]
* abnormal skin sensation [paresthesia]
* signs of compartment syndrome

=== Imaging ===
If internal bleeding is suspected a FAST exam may be performed to look for bleeding in the abdomen.

If the patient has stable vital signs, they may undergo diagnostic imaging such as a CT scan. If the patient has unstable vital signs, they may not undergo diagnostic imaging and instead may receive immediate medical or surgical treatment.

== Treatment ==
Management of internal bleeding depends on the cause and severity of the bleed. Internal bleeding is a medical emergency and should be treated immediately by medical professionals. 

=== Fluid replacement ===

If a patient has low blood pressure (hypotension), intravenous fluids can be used until they can receive a blood transfusion. In order to replace blood loss quickly and with large amounts of IV fluids or blood, patients may need a central venous catheter. Patients with severe bleeding need to receive large quantities of replacement blood via a blood transfusion. As soon as the clinician recognizes that the patient may have a severe, continuing hemorrhage requiring more than 4 units in 1 hour or 10 units in 6 hours, they should initiate a massive transfusion protocol. The massive transfusion protocol replaces red blood cells, plasma, and platelets in varying ratios based on the cause of the bleeding (traumatic vs. non-traumatic).

=== Stopping the bleeding ===

It is crucial to stop the internal bleeding immediately (achieve hemostasis) after identifying its cause. The longer it takes to achieve hemostasis in people with traumatic causes (e.g. pelvic fracture) and non-traumatic causes (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm), the higher the death rate is. 

Unlike with external bleeding, most internal bleeding cannot be controlled by applying pressure to the site of injury. Internal bleeding in the thorax and abdominal cavity (including both the intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal space) cannot be controlled with direct pressure (compression). A patient with acute internal bleeding in the thorax after trauma should be diagnosed, resuscitated, and stabilized in the Emergency Department in less than 10 minutes before undergoing surgery to reduce the risk of death from internal bleeding. A patient with acute internal bleeding in the abdomen or pelvis after trauma may require use of a REBOA device to slow the bleeding. The REBOA has also been used for non-traumatic causes of internal bleeding, including bleeding during childbirth and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Internal bleeding from a bone fracture in the arms or legs may be partially controlled with direct pressure using a tourniquet. After tourniquet placement, the patient may need immediate surgery to find the bleeding blood vessel.

Internal bleeding where the torso meets the extremities (&quot;junctional sites&quot; such as the axilla or groin) cannot be controlled with a tourniquet; however there is an FDA approved device known as an Abdominal Aortic and Junctional Tourniquet (AAJT) designed for proximal aortic control, although very few studies examining its use have been published. For bleeding at junctional sites, a dressing with a blood clotting agent (hemostatic dressing) should be applied.

A campaign is to improve the care of the bleeding known as &quot;Stop The Bleed&quot; campaign is also taking place.

<doc id="619457" wikidata="Q2735345" url="?curid=619457" title="Hell Freezes Over">
<text>Hell Freezes Over is the second live album by the Eagles, released in 1994. The album is the first to be released after the Eagles had reformed following a fourteen-year break up. The band&#x27;s lineup was that of the &quot;Long Run&quot; era: Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Don Felder, Joe Walsh, and Timothy B. Schmit. It contains four new studio tracks and eleven tracks recorded live in April 1994 for an MTV special. Two Top 40 Mainstream singles, &quot;Get Over It&quot; and &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot;, were released from the album. It also features an acoustic version of &quot;Hotel California&quot;. The four new studio recordings are the last to feature Don Felder, who was fired from the band in 2001.

The album went to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart upon its release where it stayed for two weeks. The album has sold over 9 million copies in the United States.

&quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; was also released in video form on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD. Before the album was released, the Eagles also started a tour, which would last from 1994 to 1996 and became one of the most successful tours in music history.

==Background==
The album name is in reference to a quote by Don Henley after the band&#x27;s breakup in 1980. Henley was asked in an interview about when the band would play together again, to which he responded &quot;when Hell freezes over&quot;. Glenn Frey also said in 1982 on the breakup: &quot;I just rule out the possibility of putting the Eagles back together for a Lost Youth and Greed tour.&quot;

In 1993, an Eagles tribute album, &quot;Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles&quot;, was recorded by several country artists. Travis Tritt, who covered &quot;Take It Easy&quot; in the album, asked the band to appear in his video for the song. The band members agreed, and it would be the first time the group had appeared together in 13 years. Two months later, Frey and Henley had lunch with their management and decided to reunite.

The band members performed live for the first time in April 1994 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California for an MTV special. The recording sessions produced 11 tracks for the &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; album, including a new arrangement of &quot;Hotel California&quot; that featured an extended acoustic guitar and percussion opening. At the beginning of the concert, Frey joked to the audience: &quot;For the record, we never broke up; we just took a 14-year vacation&quot;. The tour began on May 27, and the &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; album was released on November 8, 1994. The album is the band&#x27;s second live album, after 1980&#x27;s &quot;Eagles Live&quot;.

A new song &quot;Get Over It&quot; became a modest hit and another new song, &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot;, reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart.

The DVD is one of the first music releases to feature a DTS format soundtrack in addition to a PCM stereo soundtrack. The DVD also featured the song &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot; in DTS audio only. The DVD has since been re-released with an additional Dolby Digital soundtrack. The album was also released as a DTS CD in 1997.

<doc id="619461" wikidata="Q17082206" url="?curid=619461" title="Music Midtown">
<text>Music Midtown is a large music festival held in Atlanta, Georgia, annually from 1994 to 2005, after which it returned in 2011 following a six-year hiatus. The festival ran consecutively from 2011-2019 with a cancellation in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The festival returned briefly in 2021, before a cancellation in 2022. In May 2023, it was announced that Music Midtown would return. The festival runs for one weekend each year, typically in September. The event drew in excess of 300,000 attendees per year during its peak years.

The festival began as a two-day event with three stages, and later grew to a three-day event with six main stages. Each of these stages were typically sponsored by a local Atlanta radio station and were used to present dozens of bands playing a wide variety of musical genres. Due to a decline in attendance and rising expenses after the 2005 festival, promoters placed the festival on hiatus in 2006.

In 2011, the festival returned as a one-day event, and expanded to a two-day format the following year. On August 1, 2022 the festival was cancelled due to Georgia gun laws preventing organizers from banning firearms at the event, which was held in a public park. Upon the return of the festival in 2023, it was announced the event would now take place over 3-days and occurred from September 15–17, 2023.

==History==
===Origins===

The festival was conceived by Atlanta-based music promoters Alex Cooley, Peter Conlon and Alex Hoffman who sought to create an event similar to the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. The intent was to present a wide variety of music that both men had come to enjoy during their careers in the music industry.

In 1994, the festival launched on a parcel of undeveloped land at Peachtree St. and Tenth St. in the heart of Midtown&#x27;s business district. After a few years at this site, the festival was forced to move to make way for the construction of the new Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The new festival site chosen was in downtown just north of Centennial Olympic Park and consisted mainly of closed-off streets and surface parking lots which made for a hot and somewhat unpleasant experience for daytime concert-goers. This site is now home to the Georgia Aquarium and the World of Coca-Cola museum. This led to a brief stay of two years after which the festival moved to the 42 acre (170,000 m2) location adjacent to the Atlanta Civic Center and now closed SciTrek. After finding this new home, the festival grew dramatically and attracted around 300,000 attendees during its peak years.

===Changes, 2005, and decline===

In 2000, the festival featured its largest show to date. They increased their stage amount to six and featured over 130 bands.
Although independent promoters when the festival was created, Cooley and Conlon sold their company, Concert/Southern Promotions, to Clear Channel Communications&#x27; subsidiary SFX Entertainment in 1998. In November 2004, Alex Cooley was released by Clear Channel Entertainment in part due to his unsuccessful assimilation into the corporate culture. His age and health problems (diabetes) prevented him from working full-time which also played a role.

Traditionally on the first weekend in May, the 2005 festival was moved to June 10–12. This was supposedly done for better weather, although this ended up being counterproductive, as it put the festival into even more heat and humidity and at a greater risk for thunderstorms with dangerous lightning. Most of the 2005 festival was rained on by remnants of Tropical Storm Arlene, repeating many of the May rains it was rescheduled to avoid. Special outdoor tiles were put down in front of the stages to protect the grass and keep it from turning to mud.

The 2005 festival also doubled the talent budget and raised 3-day ticket prices from $45 to $75. Conlon cited media reports of potential traffic problems from Music Midtown and the concurrent Vibe MusicFest at the Georgia Dome as &quot;killing&quot; advance ticket sales in the weeks before the event. Others believe that the higher ticket prices may have exceeded the affordability of younger concert-goers. The slated 2005 dates were also concurrent with the increasingly popular Bonnaroo music and arts festival in neighboring Tennessee, which may have affected both attendance and artist booking.

===Hiatus and resurrection===
On January 5, 2006, Conlon announced that there would be no Music Midtown in 2006 due to the growing expenses of the festival in its current form and location. Although Conlon left open the possibility of a return at a different location in the future, this ultimately left Music Midtown in limbo and on hiatus through 2010.

On July 6, 2011, Mayor Kasim Reed and Conlon announced that the festival would return for 2011 as a one-day event on September 24, 2011, at Piedmont Park. Ticket prices for the event were $55, with two stages and The Black Keys and Coldplay headlining. Additional acts included Cage the Elephant, Manchester Orchestra, Young the Giant, The Joy Formidable and others.

On September 21, 2011, Conlon said due to the success of advance ticket sales for 2011, he was already planning for a 2012 version of the festival. &quot;Next year will definitely be two days, a little more diverse,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt that getting something [produced] this year was important. It&#x27;s gotten people focused again. But I&#x27;ll start thinking about next year the week after this one. It takes a year to plan these things right.&quot; Following the event, local media estimated attendance at 40,000.

In 2015, a fourth stage was added to the summer festival. This year they spent almost in $18 million in production. They also donated $100,000 to the Piedmont Park Conservancy. According to the research center at the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce, attendee spending brings over $11 million of income to Atlanta.

In 2016, the creators decided to change the format of the festival. In previous years, the shows took place on Friday and Saturday. The new format moved the shows to Saturday and Sunday due to the large amount of traffic from the neighboring Henry W. Grady High School and the rush hour time period posing a risk.

<text>The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is the head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and is thus responsible for enforcing the nation&#x27;s Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, as well as numerous other environmental statutes. The administrator is nominated by the president of the United States and must be confirmed by a vote of the Senate.

Lee Zeldin is the current administrator of the EPA.

== Rank in the Cabinet ==
Since the Clinton administration, the EPA administrator has been accorded cabinet rank by the president. The administrator of the EPA is equivalent to the position of minister of the environment in other countries. There have been various proposals to make the EPA a full executive department.

== Acting administrators ==
Acting administrators usually assume the office in the interim period between the resignation of a previous administrator and the confirmation of his or her successor, including during the transition period between two presidential administrations, before the successor has been nominated and confirmed. Acting administrators come from within the EPA and usually hold an office that is subject to Senate confirmation before becoming the acting administrator. Linda Fisher and Stephen L. Johnson had served as Deputy Administrator when they became acting administrator. Marianne Lamont Horinko was an assistant administrator at the time. They are not subject to Senate confirmation to serve as the acting administrator, though to continue to serve as a full-fledged administrator (as in the case of Lee M. Thomas or Stephen L. Johnson), they must be confirmed by the Senate.

== Line of succession ==
The line of succession for the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is as follows:
#Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency
#General Counsel
#Assistant Administrator for the Office of Land and Emergency Management
#Assistant Administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention
#Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation

<text>The sallet (also called &quot;celata&quot;, &quot;salade&quot; and &quot;schaller&quot;) was a combat helmet that replaced the bascinet in Italy, western and northern Europe and Hungary during the mid-15th century. In Italy, France and England the armet helmet was also popular, but in Germany the sallet became almost universal. 

==Origins==
The origin of the sallet seems to have been in Italy, where the term &quot;celata&quot; is first recorded in an inventory of the arms and armour of the Gonzaga family dated to 1407. In essence, the earliest sallets were a variant of the bascinet, intended to be worn without an aventail or visor. To protect the face and neck, left exposed by abandonment of the visor and aventail, the rear was curved out into a flange to protect the neck, and the sides of the helmet were drawn forward below the level of the eyes to protect the cheeks. The latter development was most pronounced in the barbute or &quot;barbuta,&quot; a variation of the sallet that adopted elements of Classical Corinthian helmets.

==Later developments and regional variations==
The sallet became popular in France, England and the Netherlands through contact with Italy and eventually was adopted in Germany. Regional styles developed, which were catered for by the great armour manufacturing centres of northern Italy (especially Milan) and southern Germany (Augsburg and Nuremberg). However, though a sallet, or complete armour, might be German in style, it could have been of Italian manufacture, or vice versa. The German sallet may have been the product of the melding of influences from the Italian sallet and the deep-skulled &quot;German war-hat,&quot; a type of brimmed &quot;chapel de fer&quot; helmet.

Later Italian sallets (by c. 1460) lost their integral face protection and became open-faced helmets with gracefully curved surfaces. In this simple state they were favoured by more lightly armed troops, especially archers and crossbowmen, whose uninterrupted vision was at a premium. For more heavily armoured troops, a greater level of protection could be afforded by the attachment of a plate reinforcer for the brow of the helmet and a deep visor, usually of the &#x27;bellows&#x27; form which incorporated many ventilation slits. Such helmets would have been worn with a stiffened mail collar, termed a &quot;standard,&quot; which protected the throat and neck. Some Italian-style sallets were provided with a covering of rich cloth, usually velvet, which was edged in silver-gilt, gilded brass or copper; ornamental decoration in the same metals could be added to the surface of the helmet, allowing areas of cloth to show through.
In the period 1450–1460, a distinctive German style of sallet appeared. It was round-skulled but was less smoothly curving than the Italian sallet; its most obvious feature was that the rear of the helmet was drawn out into a long tail, sometimes consisting of a number of lames. One characteristic that distinguishes early German sallets from later German sallets up to c.1495, is the length of the helmet tail, which became more pronounced over time. The front of these helmets sometimes extended down to cover the upper face, with eye-slits provided for vision. Other versions retained the same outline, but the upper face was protected by a movable half-visor. German sallets were often worn with a separate scoop-shaped plate gorget, called a bevor, that extended from the upper chest to just below the nose and protected the wearer&#x27;s lower face and throat. Most needed no added ventilation holes, as there was a natural gap where the visor or front of the helmet overlapped the bevor near the wearer&#x27;s mouth.

By the mid 15th century, a regional variety of sallet had evolved in England and the Netherlands, termed the &#x27;English-Burgundian style&#x27; (the Netherlands were at that time ruled by the Duke of Burgundy). It was usually worn with a bevor by more completely armoured soldiers and had very similar facial protection to, and frontal appearance as, the German sallet. It was, however, more curvilinear, and possessed a less extreme projection to the rear. In many ways, it was intermediate between the German and Italian forms. French sallets were very similar to the English-Burgundian type and all have been classed as &quot;short-tailed sallets.&quot;

==Demise==
In the last generations of German sallets, the bevor was articulated from the same pivot as the visor. Initially the bevor was attached inside the skull. When the long tail at the rear of the helmet was eventually shortened, from c. 1495, these later sallets became virtually indistinguishable from close helmets, and the articulation of the bevor moved to the outside of the skull. The sallet was gradually abandoned for field use in the first quarter of the 16th century, being largely replaced by the close helm and burgonet; however, it was retained into the mid century, in a heavily reinforced form, for some types of jousting.

The German-style sallet was the model for the World War I German &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;, whereas the kettle hat inspired the contemporary British and French helmets.

<text>HMS &quot;Danae&quot; was a frigate of the Royal Navy. She was, like the rest of the class, named after a figure of mythology. &quot;Danae&quot; was built by Devonport Dockyard. She was launched on 31 October 1965 and commissioned on 10 October 1967.

==Construction==
&quot;Danae&quot; was ordered during 1963 as one of three &quot;Leander&quot;s built under the 1963–1964. The ship was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 16 December 1964, was launched on 31 October 1965 and completed on 7 September 1967. She commissioned with the Pennant number F47 on 10 October 1967.

&quot;Danae&quot; was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was fitted with Y-136 machinery, built by J. Samuel White. Two oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. Anti-aircraft defence was provided by a quadruple Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launcher on the hangar roof, while two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon for close-in defence against surface targets. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

As built, &quot;Danae&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried over the ship&#x27;s bridge to direct the 4.5-inch guns, while a GWS22 director for Seacat was mounted on the hangar roof. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 or 184 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar. While &quot;Danae&quot; was fitted with a well to accommodate Type 199 variable depth sonar, it was never fitted.

==Royal Navy service==
In 1968, &quot;Danae&quot; became a Gibraltar guardship and later joined in South America to perform royal escort duties. &quot;Danae&quot; subsequently undertook a Beira Patrol, which was designed to prevent oil reaching landlocked Rhodesia via the then Portuguese colony of Mozambique, of which the port of Beira there gave its name to the operation. &quot;Danae&quot; deployed to the Far East visiting Australia, New Zealand and Japan, and remained in that region until the middle of 1969. She then undertook another Beira Patrol (a routine duty for the Royal Navy until it was stopped in 1975) and finally returned to Devonport in October 1969, having been deployed for 12 months.

In 1974, &quot;Danae&quot; deployed to the Far East via South Africa, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The following year, &quot;Danae&quot; performed a variety of duties while in the North Atlantic including oil-rig and fishery protection. She became a member (later flagship) of the NATO Standing Naval Force Atlantic, shadowing the Russian Navy&#x27;s Ocean 75 exercise.

During the 1970s, &quot;Danae&quot; was one of the &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates used as the fictional &quot;HMS &quot;Hero&quot;&quot; for the popular TV drama series &quot;Warship&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; featured &quot;Warship&quot; being filmed at Plymouth Dockyard on board &quot;Danae&quot;, with Lesley Judd in 1975. Six episodes of &quot;Warship&quot; were filmed aboard &quot;Danae&quot; around that time.

In 1977, &quot;Danae&quot; took part in the Royal Navy Fleet Review to celebrate HM the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. &quot;Danae&quot; was placed between her sister ship and .

In August 1977, &quot;Danae&quot; started a major reconstruction at Devonport Dockyard. The conversion included the removal and replacement of all the ship&#x27;s armament. The Mark 6 4.5-in gun mount was replaced by four Exocet anti-ship missiles. The Limbo anti-submarine mortar was removed to give a larger flight deck and the ship&#x27;s hangar was enlarged to allow a Westland Lynx helicopter to be operated, while two triple STWS torpedo tubes provided short range anti-submarine capability. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of one Seacat launcher mounted forward of the Exocet containers and two more mounted aft on the hangar roof, backed up by two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns on the bridge wings. Type 1006 navigation radar replaced the old Type 974 radar, while the MRS3 gun control director as replaced by a GWS22 director for the forward Seacat launcher, with a second Seacat director mounted aft. Type 184M sonar replaced the main hull sonar, while the VDS was removed and its well plated over. Displacement rose to standard and , with speed falling by two knots. The modernisation was completed in September 1980.

In January 1982, &quot;Danae&quot; joined NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force North Atlantic on a six-month assignment and in June that year, in the aftermath of the Falklands War, deployed as part of the escort of the carrier when she deployed to the South Atlantic, returning to Devonport in October 1982. In June–July 1983 &quot;Danae&quot; had her close-in anti-aircraft armament strengthened as a result of operational experience in the Falklands. A twin Oerlikon 20 mm cannon mount was fitted aft, while two single Oerlikon 20 mm guns, in BMARC GAM BO1 mounts, replaced the ship&#x27;s boats amidships, and improved launchers for chaff and flares were fitted. Following this modification, the ship returned to the South Atlantic to undertake a Falkland Islands patrol, at a time when that region was still very tense. In 1985, &quot;Danae&quot; made yet another journey to the South Atlantic. In the late 1980s the ship became ever more active with NATO&#x27;s multi-national squadrons, though she was beginning to show signs of her increasing age.

==Ecuadorian service==

In 1991, &quot;Danae&quot; was decommissioned from the Royal Navy and was sold to the Ecuadorian Navy, along with , on 25 April 1991.&quot;Danae&quot;″s torpedo tubes were removed before transfer, and the sale did not include Exocet or Seacat missiles. &quot;Danae&quot; was renamed BAE &quot;Morán Valverde&quot; in Ecuadorian service, with the Pennant Number FM-01. &quot;Morán Valverde&quot; had Exocet missiles restored in Ecuadorian service, while three twin SIMBAD launchers for Mistral anti-aircraft missiles replaced the Seacat launchers. The ship was re-fitted with six anti-submarine torpedo tubes, launching Italian Whitehead A244 torpedoes (These torpedo tubes had been removed from two &quot;Esmeraldas&quot;-class corvettes.

In 2002, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; noted that both Ecuadorian Leanders suffered from engine problems, with replacement of the ships&#x27; steam turbines with diesel engines being considered, and that sea time of the two frigates was limited. &quot;Morán Valverde&quot; was decommissioned in October 2008. In September 2010 she was taken into Andec Dock Ecuador to be scrapped, a process which was expected to be complete by March 2011.

<text>The variable sunbird or yellow-bellied sunbird (Cinnyris venustus), formerly &quot;Nectarinia venusta&quot;, is a sunbird. The sunbirds are a group of small Old World passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed most of the time.

The variable sunbird is a fairly common resident breeder in equatorial Africa. Two eggs are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. This species is found in open woodland and cultivation.

Variable sunbirds are small, only 10 cm long. They have medium-length thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to their nectar feeding.

The adult male has a glossy green head, throat and nape, and a maroon breast band. In most subspecies, the belly of the male is yellow, but in a few it is orange or white. The female has grey-brown upperparts and yellowish underparts, and an obvious pale supercilium. The eclipse male is like the female, but shows some green, especially on the throat. The call is a clear &quot;tew-tew-tew-tew-tew&quot;.

<doc id="619485" wikidata="Q1642086" url="?curid=619485" title="Bascinet">
<text>The bascinet – also bassinet, basinet, or bazineto – was a Medieval European open-faced combat helmet. It evolved from a type of iron or steel skullcap, but had a more pointed apex to the skull, and it extended downwards at the rear and sides to afford protection for the neck. A mail curtain (aventail or camail) was usually attached to the lower edge of the helmet to protect the throat, neck and shoulders. A visor (face guard) was often employed from c. 1330 to protect the exposed face. Early in the fifteenth century, the camail began to be replaced by a plate metal gorget, giving rise to the so-called &quot;great bascinet&quot;.

==Early development==
The first recorded reference to a bascinet, or &quot;bazineto&quot;, was in the Italian city of Padua in 1281, when it is described as being worn by infantry.

It is believed that the bascinet evolved from a simple iron skullcap, known as the cervelliere, which was worn with a mail coif, as either the sole form of head protection or beneath a great helm. The bascinet is differentiated from the cervelliere by having a higher, pointed skull. By about 1330 the bascinet had been extended lower down the sides and back of the head. Within the next 20 years it had extended to the base of the neck and covered the cheeks. The bascinet appeared quite suddenly in the later 13th century and some authorities see it as being influenced by Byzantine or Middle-Eastern Muslim helmets. The bascinet, without a visor, continued to be worn underneath larger &quot;great helms&quot; (also termed &quot;&quot;).

==Protection for the throat, neck and face==
===Camails or aventails===
Unlike the cervelliere, which was worn in conjunction with, often underneath, a complete hood of mail called the coif, early bascinets were typically worn with a neck and throat defence of mail that was attached to the lower edge of the helmet itself; this mail &quot;curtain&quot; was called a camail or aventail. The earliest camails were riveted directly to the edge of the helmet, however, beginning in the 1320s a detachable version replaced this type. The detachable aventail was attached to a leather band, which was in turn attached to the lower border of the bascinet by a series of staples called vervelles. Holes in the leather band were passed over the vervelles, and a waxed cord was passed through the holes in the vervelles to secure it.

=== Bretache ===
This illustration shows a bascinet with a type of detachable nasal (nose protector) called the bretache or &quot;bretèche&quot; made of sheet metal. The bretache was attached to the aventail at the chin, and it fastened to a hook or clamp on the brow of the helmet. According to Boeheim, this type of defence was prevalent in Germany, appearing around 1330 and fading from use around 1370. The bretache was also used in Italy; one of the first representations of it is on the equestrian statue of Cangrande I della Scala, who died in 1329. It is also shown on the tomb of Bernardino dei Baranzoni in the Museo Lapidario Estense in Modena, created c. 1345–50. An advantage of the bretache was that it could be worn under a great helm, but afforded some facial protection when the great helm was taken off. Use of the bretache preceded and overlapped with that of a new type of visor used with the bascinet, the &quot;klappvisor&quot; or &quot;klappvisier&quot;.

=== Visored bascinets ===
The open-faced bascinet, even with the mail aventail, still left the exposed face vulnerable. However, from about 1330, the bascinet was often worn with a &quot;face guard&quot; or movable visor.

The &quot;klappvisor&quot; or &quot;klappvisier&quot; was a type of visor employed on bascinets from around 1330–1340; this type of visor was hinged at a single point in the centre of the brow of the helmet skull. It was particularly favoured in Germany, but was also used in northern Italy where it is shown in a Crucifixion painted in the chapter hall of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, c. 1367. Its use in Italy seems to have ceased around 1380, but continued in Germany into the 15th century. The klappvisor has been characterised as being intermediate between the bretache nasal and the side pivoting visor. Sources disagree on the nature of the &quot;klappvisier&quot;. A minority, including De Vries and Smith, class all smaller visors, those that only cover the area of the face left exposed by the aventail, as &quot;klappvisiers&quot;, regardless of the construction of their hinge mechanism. However, they agree that &quot;klappvisiers&quot;, by their alternative definition of &#x27;being of small size&#x27;, preceded the larger forms of visor, which almost exclusively employed the double pivot, found in the latter part of the 14th century.

The side-pivot mount, which used two pivots – one on each side of the helmet, is shown in funerary monuments and other pictorial or sculptural sources of the 1340s. One of the early depictions of a doubly pivoted visor on a bascinet is the funerary monument of Sir Hugh Hastings (d. 1347) in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Elsing, Norfolk, England. The pivots were connected to the visor by means of hinges to compensate for any lack of parallelism between the pivots. The hinges usually had a removable pin holding them together, this allowed the visor to be completely detached from the helmet, if desired. The side-pivot system was commonly seen in Italian armours.

=== Hounskull ===

Whether of the &quot;klappvisor&quot; or double-pivot type, the visors of the first half of the 14th century tended to be of a relatively flat profile with little projection from the face. They had eye-slits surrounded by a flange to help deflect weapon points. From around 1380 the visor, by this time considerably larger than earlier forms, was drawn out into a conical point like a muzzle or a beak, and was given the names &quot;hounskull&quot; (from the German &quot;hundsgugel&quot; – &quot;hound&#x27;s hood&quot;) or &quot;pig-faced&quot; (in modern parlance). The protruding muzzle gave better protection to the face from blows by offering a deflecting surface. It also improved ventilation, as its greater surface area allowed it to have more holes for air to pass through.

=== Rounded visors ===
From about 1410 the visor attached to bascinets lost its pointed &quot;hounskull&quot; shape, and became progressively more rounded. By 1435 it gave an &quot;ape-like&quot; profile to the helmet; by 1450 it formed a sector in the, by then, almost globular bascinet. Ventilation holes in the visor tended to become larger and more numerous.

==Later evolution of the helmet==
Between c. 1390 and 1410 the bascinet had an exaggeratedly tall skull with an acutely pointed profile – sometimes so severe as to have a near-vertical back. Ten years later both the skull of the helmet and the hinged visor started to become less angular and more rounded. Almost globular forms became common by c. 1450. As part of the same process the helmet became more close-fitting, and narrowed to follow the contours of the neck.

===Bevors and gorgets===
Around 1350, during the reign of John II, French bascinets began to be fitted with a hinged chin- or jaw-piece (bevor (sense 2), ), upon which the visor would be able to rest. The visor and bevor that closed flush with each other thus provided better protection against incoming sword blows. This type of defence augmented the camail rather than replaced it.

The bascinet fitted with a camail was relatively heavy and most of the weight was supported directly by the head. Plate gorgets were introduced from c. 1400–1410, which replaced the camail and moved the weight of the throat and neck defences from the head to the shoulders. At the same time a plate covering the cheeks and lower face was introduced also called the &quot;bavière&quot; (contemporary usage was not precise). This &quot;bavière&quot; was directly attached by rivets to the skull of the bascinet. The combined skull and &quot;bavière&quot; could rotate within the upper part of the gorget, which overlapped them. A degree of freedom of movement was retained, but was probably less than had been the case with the mail camail.

===Great bascinet===
In the view of Oakeshott the replacement of the camail by a plate gorget gave rise to the form of helmet known as the &quot;great bascinet&quot;. Many other scholars consider that the term should be reserved for bascinets where the skull, and baviere – if present, was fixed to the gorget, rendering the whole helmet immobile.

Early gorgets were wide, copying the shape of the earlier aventail, however, with the narrowing of the neck opening the gorget plates had to be hinged to allow the helmet to be put on. Early great bascinets had the skull of the helmet riveted to the rear gorget plate, however, some later great bascinets had the skull forged in a single piece with the rear gorget plate. The gorget was often strapped to both the breast and backplate of the cuirass. In this late form the head was relieved of the entire weight of the helmet, which rested on the shoulders; however, the helmet was rendered totally immobile and the head of the wearer had only limited abilities to move inside it. Though very strongly constructed, this type of helmet imposed limitations on the wearer&#x27;s vision and agility.

==Historic use==
===Use with the great helm===
Bascinets, other than great bascinets, could be worn beneath a great helm. However, only those without face protection, or those with the close fitting bretache, could be worn in this manner. The great helm afforded a high degree of protection, but at the cost of very restricted vision and agility. The lighter types of bascinet gave less protection but allowed greater freedom of movement and better vision. The practicality of a man-at-arms being able to take off a great helm during a battle, if he wanted to continue fighting wearing just a bascinet, is unclear. By the mid 14th century the great helm was probably largely relegated to tournament use. However, Henry V of England is reputed to have worn a great helm over a bascinet at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. He was recorded as receiving a blow to the head during the battle, which damaged his helmet; the double protection afforded by wearing two helmets may have saved his life.

===Later use===
By the middle of the 14th century, most knights had discarded the great helm altogether in favor of a fully visored bascinet. The bascinet, both with and without a visor, was the most common helmet worn in Europe during most of the 14th century and the first half of the 15th century, including during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Contemporary illustrations show a majority of knights and men-at-arms wearing one of a few variants of the bascinet helmet. Indeed, so ubiquitous was the use of the helmet that &quot;bascinet&quot; became an alternative term for a man-at-arms. Though primarily associated with use by the &quot;knightly&quot; classes and other men-at-arms some infantry also made use of the lighter versions of this helmet. Regions where rich citizens were fielded as infantry, such as Italy, and other lands producing specialised professional infantry such as the English and Welsh longbowman probably saw the greatest use of bascinets by infantrymen.

The basic design of the earlier, conical version of the helmet was intended to direct blows from weapons downward and away from the skull and face of the wearer. Later versions of the bascinet, especially the great bascinet, were designed to maximise coverage and therefore protection. In achieving this they sacrificed the mobility and comfort of the wearer; thus, ironically, returning to the situation that the wearers of the cumbersome great helm experienced and that the early bascinets were designed to overcome. It is thought that poorer men-at-arms continued to employ lighter bascinets with mail camails long after the richest had adopted plate gorgets.

===Decline in use===
Soon after 1450 the &quot;great bascinet&quot; was rapidly discarded for field use, being replaced by the armet and sallet, which were lighter helmets allowing greater freedom of movement for the wearer. However, a version of the great bascinet, usually with a cage-like visor, remained in use for foot combat in tournaments into the 16th century.

<doc id="619486" wikidata="Q2354690" url="?curid=619486" title="Amsinckia">
<text>Amsinckia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as fiddlenecks. The common name is derived from the flower stems, which curl over at the top in a manner reminiscent of the head of a fiddle. Fiddlenecks are in the family Boraginaceae, along with borage and forget-me-nots. The genus is named after the patrician Amsinck family in honour of the Hamburg head of state and patron of botany Wilhelm Amsinck (1752–1831).

==Distribution and description==
The fiddlenecks are native to western North America and south-western South America, but they are naturalized in other regions. They are annuals, many of them bristly. Most have an erect stem, whose height varies from 20 to 120 cm. In most species the flowers are yellow, often with an orange tinge. Most are found at relatively low altitudes, below 500 metres.

The seeds and foliage of fiddlenecks are poisonous to livestock, particularly cattle, because they contain alkaloids and high concentrations of nitrates. The sharp hairs of the plants can cause skin irritation in humans. However, the shoots, seeds or leaves of several species were used as food by Native Americans, and the plant also had some medicinal uses.

The species are hard to distinguish, and their ranges overlap; furthermore, several of them have large numbers of slightly different varieties, and several of the species hybridise naturally. To decide which species a particular specimen belongs to, therefore, is likely to require a detailed examination with an identification key in hand.

==Species==
*&quot;Amsinckia calycina&quot;, Hairy fiddleneck or yellow burweed—Native to Argentina and Chile.
* &quot;Amsinckia carinata&quot;, Malheur fiddleneck—Rare. Endemic to Oregon and listed as endangered by the state. Has been considered to be a synonym of &quot;A. vernicosa&quot;, but this is implausible given the separation of their ranges.
* &quot;Amsinckia douglasiana&quot;, Douglas&#x27; fiddleneck—Uncommon. South Coast and Western Transverse Ranges of California
* &quot;Amsinckia eastwoodiae&quot;, Eastwood&#x27;s fiddleneck—Lower-lying areas of central and southern California, west of the Sierra Nevada
* &quot;Amsinckia grandiflora&quot;, Large-flowered fiddleneck—Central Valley of California. Endemic to California and listed as endangered by the state and by the US federal government.
* &quot;Amsinckia lunaris&quot;, Bent-flowered fiddleneck—Uncommon. San Francisco Bay Area, Inner Coast Ranges and western Central Valley of California. Endemic to California and listed as fairly endangered by the state.
* &quot;Amsinckia lycopsoides&quot;, Tarweed fiddleneck—Common. Found in all the Pacific coast states of the USA (though not east of the Sierra Nevada in California), and into Idaho to the east and British Columbia to the north
* &quot;Amsinckia marginata&quot; — Endemic to Ecuador.
* &quot;Amsinckia menziesii&quot;, Rancher&#x27;s fireweed—Abundant throughout the western states of the US, in British Columbia and in Baja California, at heights of up to 1700 metres. Also found as an alien species in eastern North America and the Old World. Several varieties recognised.
* &quot;Amsinckia spectabilis&quot;, Seaside fiddleneck or woolly breeches—Found on the Pacific coast of North America from British Columbia to Baja California, and on offshore islands, at heights of up to 300m.
* &quot;Amsinckia tessellata&quot;, Devil&#x27;s lettuce or bristly fiddleneck—Common. Found at heights up to 2200 metres, in most of California, Arizona, Oregon and Washington; also found in South America. Absent from the Sierra Nevada and the north coastal regions of California. Several varieties recognised.
* &quot;Amsinckia vernicosa&quot;, Green fiddleneck—Uncommon. Found at heights of up to 1500 metres, in the south Coast Ranges of California and the Mojave Desert.

<doc id="619491" wikidata="Q3401382" url="?curid=619491" title="Prasiola">
<text>Prasiola is a genus of macroscopic green algae, found in a variety of habitats ranging from terrestrial, freshwater, to marine. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, ranging from the Arctic to the Antarctic.

Plants belonging to the genus &quot;Prasiola&quot; were first described by John Lightfoot in 1777 in his series &quot;Flora Scotica&quot;, as the name &quot;Ulva crispa&quot;. In 1838, Giuseppe Giovanni Antonio Meneghini circumscribed the genus.

Species of &quot;Prasiola&quot; are edible and are often harvested for food, particularly &quot;Prasiola japonica&quot;, in countries such as Japan and Myanmar.

== Description ==
&quot;Prasiola&quot; forms single-layered blades which may range in shape from fan-shaped, ribbon-shaped, to wedge-shaped and may or may not have a distinct stipe. In some species, plants start as uniseriate, unbranched filaments or thin ribbons. Blades may be attached to a substrate or may be freely floating or lying. Individual cells are quadrangular, and arranged in regular rows, sometimes grouped into blocks of four or eight. Individual cells are uninucleate (with a single nucleus) and contain a star-shaped chloroplast with a single central pyrenoid.

== Reproduction ==
Life history and reproductive strategies of &quot;Prasiola&quot; differ between species. Asexual reproduction occurs by fragmentation or aplanospores. Sexual reproduction has only been reported in some species, and is oogamous, with flagellated sperm and non-motile egg cells. During sexual reproduction, the thallus may become polystromatic (thicker than one cell). Both male and female gametes may be produced on the same thalli (i.e. are monoecious) or different thalli (i.e. are dioecious).

==Evolution==
Molecular phylogenetic studies have found that &quot;Prasiola&quot; is sister to a clade containing the similar genus &quot;Rosenvingiella&quot; and &quot;Rosenvingiellopsis&quot;. The genera &quot;Prasiola&quot; and &quot;Rosenvingiella&quot; were sometimes considered to be congeneric. The studies have also shown that freshwater and marine species of &quot;Prasiola&quot; are representatives of a lineage that back-colonized their habitats from a terrestrial ancestor; this is the opposite situation of colonization from sea to land and with few documented examples. &quot;Prasiola&quot; forms a nearly monophyletic group, but the subaerial alga &quot;Prasiococcus&quot; was found to be nested within the &quot;Prasiola&quot; clade.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Prasiola&quot; species are found in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats. Freshwater species in this genus are common in cold-water streams. Terrestrial species often inhabit soil, rocks, and tree trunks; they are particularly common in nitrogen-rich areas such as guano deposits. Marine species are mostly found in the intertidal or splash zone; each individual plant is small but they usually grow side by side to form a dense green turf on rock surfaces. In areas like Antarctica, &quot;Prasiola&quot; is one of the most important primary producers.

Marine &quot;Prasiola&quot; often have the ascomycete fungus &quot;Mastodia tessellata&quot; (also known as &quot;Kohlmeyera complicatula&quot;, &quot;Turgidosculum complicatulum&quot;) growing within their thalli. When the two species grow together, the thalli of &quot;Prasiola&quot; change in morphology, to becoming olive green and with a rough and convoluted surface. The true nature of their relationship is unclear. It has been variously described as a mycophycobiosis, a lichen-like symbiosis, or a parasitic relationship.

== Species ==
There are about 35 species in the genus.

*&quot;Prasiola antarctica&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola anziana&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola borealis&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola calophylla&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola crispa&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola cristata&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola delicata&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola delicatula&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola elongata&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola fangchengensis&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola filiformis&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola flotowii&quot; 
*&quot;Prasiola fluviatilis&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola formosana&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola furfuracea&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola glacialis&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola hubeica&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola japonica&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola johanseni&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola lanpingensis&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola linearis&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola mauritiana&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola meridionalis&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola mexicana&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola minuta&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola nevadensis&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola novaezelandiae&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola sinica&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola skottsbergii&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola snareana&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola stipitata&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola subareolata&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola tibetica&quot;
*&quot;Prasiola volcanica&quot; 
*&quot;Prasiola velutina&quot; 
*&quot;Prasiola yunnanica&quot;
Traditionally, species were differentiated from each other based on morphological characters, such as the size and shape of the blade and the stipe. However, species delimitation has been problematic due to extensive morphological variability. This has been corroborated by genetic studies, which have found the existence of cryptic species.

<text>Corporative federalism is a system of federalism not based on the common federalist idea of relative land area or nearest spheres of influence for governance, but on fiduciary jurisdiction to corporate personhood in which groups that are considered incorporated members of their own prerogative structure by willed agreement can delegate their individual effective legislature within the overall government.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire had a version of corporative federalism and gave its number of different ethnicities their own individual rights within their own assemblies instead of by relation to the territory of the empire.

Part of corporative federalism&#x27;s philosophical underpinnings as a form of jurisdiction rests within the auspices of demographics as polities as much as they are constituencies of a federative structure. Theories adding philosophic backing to its own conceptualizations from such ideas as diplomatic recognition and the sovereign state&#x27;s right to exist as if it extended beyond territorial nation-state in an international structure, to an intranational structure of the voluntary association of those with similar social world views being codified legal frameworks to themselves, within their own sphere of interaction, under a federal government of a particular nation state and relying on infrastructural power for implementation.

<text>Lushootseed ( ), historically known as Puget Salish, Puget Sound Salish, or Skagit-Nisqually, is a Central Coast Salish language of the Salishan language family. Lushootseed is the general name for the dialect continuum composed of two main dialects, Northern Lushootseed and Southern Lushootseed, which are further separated into smaller sub-dialects.

Lushootseed was historically spoken across southern and western Puget Sound roughly between modern-day Bellingham and Olympia by a number of Indigenous peoples. Lushooteed speakers were estimated to number 12,000 at the peak.

Today, however, it is primarily a ceremonial language, spoken for heritage or symbolic purposes. There are about 472 known second-language speakers of Lushootseed. It is classified as Critically Endangered by the UNESCO Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger and classified as Reawakening by Ethnologue.

Many Lushootseed-speaking tribes are attempting to revitalize the daily use of their language. Several language programs and classes are offered across the region.

== Name ==
Lushootseed has been historically known as Niskwalli/Nisqually, Puget Sound Salish, Puget Salish, Pugué, Squaxon, Skagit, and Skagit-Nisqually.

The name of the language in Lushootseed is pronounced (and spelled) variably across different dialects. In the northern dialects, the language is called . In most southern dialects, it is , whereas in the Muckleshoot dialect, it is pronounced . The southern pronunciation is derived from the original by de-voicing &quot;d&quot; into &quot;t&quot; and switching the position of &quot;l&quot; and &quot;ə&quot;.

The English name &quot;Lushootseed&quot; is derived from . The prefix along with the suffix means &quot;language.&quot; The root word, , is an archaic word for the Puget Sound region. Some scholars, such as Wayne Suttles, believe it may be an old word for &quot;people,&quot; possibly related to the word &quot;Salish.&quot;

==Phonology==
Lushootseed has a complex consonantal phonology and 4 vowel phonemes. Along with more common voicing and labialization contrasts, Lushootseed has a plain-glottalic contrast, which is realized as laryngealized with sonorants, and ejective with voiceless stops or fricatives. It is one of only three known languages to possess all three types of glottalized consonant (ejectives, implosives, and resonants).

===Consonants===

Lushootseed has no phonemic nasals. However, the nasals , , , and may appear in some speech styles and words as variants of and .

===Vowels===
== Syntax ==

Lushootseed can be considered a relatively agglutinating language, given its high number of morphemes, including a large number of lexical suffixes. Word order is fairly flexible, although it is generally considered to be verb-subject-object (VSO).

Lushootseed is capable of creating grammatically correct sentences that contain only a verb, with no subject or object. All information beyond the action is to be understood by context. This can be demonstrated in &#x27;[someone] managed to find [someone/something]&#x27;. Sentences which contain no verb at all are also common, as Lushootseed has no copula. An example of such a sentence is &#x27;What [is] that?&#x27;.

Despite its general status as VSO, Lushootseed can be rearranged to be subject-verb-object (SVO) and verb-object-subject (VOS). Doing so does not modify the words themselves, but requires the particle &quot;ʔə&quot; to mark the change. The exact nature of this particle is the subject of some debate.

Prepositions in Lushootseed are almost entirely handled by one word, &quot;ʔal,&quot; which can mean &#x27;on, above, in, beside, around&#x27; among a number of potential other meanings. They come before the object they reference, much like in English. Examples of this can be found in the following phrases:

# &#x27;What is that in the river?&#x27;
# &#x27;My father is working over there.&#x27;
# &#x27;On top of the bed.&#x27;

=== Pronouns ===
Lushootseed has four subject pronouns: &#x27;I&#x27; (first-person singular), &#x27;we&#x27; (first-person plural), &#x27;you&#x27; (second-person singular), and &#x27;you&#x27; (second-person plural). It does not generally refer to the third person in any way.

The subject pronoun always comes in the second position in the sentence: &#x27;Are you Lummi?&#x27;

 &#x27;I am not Lummi.&#x27; Here, negation takes the first position, the subject pronoun takes the second, and &#x27;Lummi&#x27; is pushed to the end of the sentence.

=== Negation ===
Negation in Lushootseed takes the form of an adverb &#x27;no, none, nothing&#x27; which always comes at the beginning of the sentence that is to be negated. It is constructed in two possible ways, one for negatives of existence, and one for negatives of identity. If taking the form of a negative of identity, a proclitic &quot;lə-&quot; must be added to the sentence on the next adverb. If there are no further adverbs in the sentence, the proclitic attaches to the head word of the predicate, as in the sentence &#x27;Don&#x27;t get hurt again&#x27;.

== Morphology and verbs ==

=== Verb prefixes ===
Almost all instances of a verb in Lushootseed (excluding the zero copula) carry a prefix indicating their tense and/or aspect. Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of these prefixes, along with their meanings and applications.
The prefix &quot;-&quot; is one of the most common. It indicates an imperfective aspect-present tense (similar to English &#x27;-ing&#x27;) for verbs that do not involve motion. More specifically, a verb may use &quot;-&quot; if it does not result in a change of position for its subject. It is commonly known as a &quot;state of being&quot;: &#x27;I am feeling fine.&#x27; or &#x27;I am in good health.&#x27;If a verb does involve motion, the &#x27;- prefix is replaced with &quot;-:&quot; &#x27;I&#x27;m going home.&#x27; Completed or telic actions use the prefix &#x27;-. Most verbs without &#x27;- or &quot;-&quot; will use &#x27;-. Some verbs also exhibit a contrast in meaning between &quot;-&quot; and &#x27;-, and only one of them is correct: &#x27;You jump(ed).&#x27; The verb &quot;saxʷəb&quot; literally means &#x27;to jump, leap, or run, especially in a short burst of energy&#x27;, and is correctly used with &#x27;-. In contrast, the verb &quot;&quot;, which means &#x27;to jump or run for an extended period of time&#x27;, is used with &quot;-:&quot; &#x27;You are jumping.&#x27; 

=== Possession ===
There are five possessive affixes, derived from the pronouns:

The third person singular &quot;-s&quot; is considered marginal and does not work with an actual lexical possessor.

==Related languages and current status==

Lushootseed, like its neighbors Twana, Nooksack, Klallam, and the North Straits Salish languages, are in the Central Coast Salish subgroup of the Salishan family of languages. The language is spoken by many peoples in the Puget Sound region, including the Duwamish, Suquamish, Squaxin, Muckleshoot, Snoqualmie, Nisqually, and Puyallup in the south and the Snohomish, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Swinomish in the north.
Ethnologue quotes a source published in 1990 (and therefore presumably reflecting the situation in the late 1980s), according to which there were 60 fluent speakers of Lushootseed, evenly divided between the northern and southern dialects. On the other hand, the Ethnologue list of United States languages also lists, alongside Lushootseed&#x27;s 60 speakers, 100 speakers for Skagit, 107 for Southern Puget Sound Salish, and 10 for Snohomish (a dialect on the boundary between the northern and southern varieties). Some sources given for these figures, however, go back to the 1970s when the language was less critically endangered. Linguist Marianne Mithun has collected more recent data on the number of speakers of various Native American languages, and could document that by the end of the 1990s there were only a handful of elders left who spoke Lushootseed fluently. The language was extensively documented and studied by linguists with the aid of tribal elder Vi Hilbert, d. 2008, who was the last speaker with a full native command of Lushootseed. There are efforts at reviving the language, and instructional materials have been published.

In 2014, there were only five second-language speakers of Lushootseed. As of 2022, although there were not yet native speakers, there were approximately 472 second-language Lushootseed speakers, according to data collected by the Puyallup Tribe. By their definition, a &quot;speaker&quot; includes anyone who speaks in Lushootseed for at least an hour each day.

== Language revitalization ==
, the Tulalip Tribes&#x27; Lushootseed Language Department teaches classes in Lushootseed, and its website has Lushootseed phrases with audio. The Tulalip Montessori School also teaches Lushootseed to young children. Tulalip Lushootseed language teachers also teach at the Tulalip Early Learning Academy, Quil Ceda-Tulalip Elementary in the Marysville School District, Totem Middle School, and Marysville-Getchell, Marysville-Pilchuck and Heritage High Schools. Since 1996, the Tulalip Lushootseed Department has hosted the annual , a summer language camp for children. Teachers also offer family classes in the evening every year, making Lushootseed a family experience.

Wa He Lut Indian School teaches Lushootseed to Native elementary school children in their Native Language and Culture program. 

, an annual Lushootseed conference is held at Seattle University. A course in Lushootseed language and literature has been offered at Evergreen State College.
Lushootseed has also been used as a part of environmental history courses at Pacific Lutheran University. It has been spoken during the annual Tribal Canoe Journeys that takes place throughout the Salish Sea.

There are also efforts within the Puyallup Tribe. Their website and social media, aimed at anyone interested in learning the language, are updated often.

To facilitate the use of Lushootseed in electronic files, in 2008 the Tulalip Tribes contracted type designer Juliet Shen to create Unicode-compliant typefaces that met the needs of the language. Drawing upon traditional Lushootseed carvings and artwork, she developed two typefaces: Lushootseed School and Lushootseed Sulad. The Nisqually tribe contracted the Language Conservancy to make a Lushootseed Keyboard for mobile devices.

The University of Washington has long been involved in Lushootseed research and teaching. Lushootseed was first taught on the Seattle campus in 1972 by Thom Hess, a linguistics professor, and the following year he turned over the class to Vi Hilbert, who would be the last native speaker. From 1973 to 1988, Vi Hilbert taught Lushootseed on the Seattle campus. Hess and Hilbert published a Lushootseed dictionary and readers in the 1990s. In the summers of 2016 and 2017, an adult immersion program in Lushootseed was offered at the University of Washington&#x27;s Tacoma campus. It was sponsored by The Puyallup Tribal Language Program in partnership with University of Washington Tacoma and its School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. Southern Lushootseed classes started in 2018 on the University of Washington&#x27;s Seattle campus, taught by Tami Hohn, a Puyallup tribal member.

==Dialects==
Lushootseed consists of two main dialect groups, Northern Lushootseed () and Southern Lushootseed (~). Both of these dialects can then be broken down into subdialects:
* Northern Lushootseed
** (Upper) Skagit
*** Lower Skagit (Swinomish)
** Sauk
** Snohomish (Tulalip)
* Southern Lushootseed
** Skykomish
** Snoqualmie
** Suquamish
** Duwamish
** Muckleshoot
** Puyallup
** Nisqually
** Squaxin/Sahewamish
The Lower and Upper Skagit dialects have variously been categorized as being different from one another, or one and the same, but are both recognized as being distinct from the Sauk dialect. There is no consensus on whether the Skykomish dialect should be grouped into Northern or Southern Lushootseed.

Dialects differ in several ways. Pronunciation between dialects is different. In Northern dialects, the stress of the word generally falls on the first non-schwa of the root, whereas in the Southern dialects, stress usually is placed on the penultimate syllable. Some words do not fit the pattern, but generally, pronunciation is consistent in those ways. Northern Lushootseed also was affected by progressive dissimilation targeting palatal fricatives and affricates, whereas Southern Lushootseed was not, leading to some words like (&quot;wife&quot;) being pronounced in Northern dialects.

Different dialects often use completely different words. For example, the word for &quot;raccoon&quot; is in Northern Lushootseed, whereas is used in Southern Lushootseed.

Morphology also differs between Northern and Southern Lushootseed. Northern Lushootseed and Southern Lushootseed have related, but different determiner systems. There are also several differences in utilizing the prefix for marking &quot;place where&quot; or &quot;reason for,&quot; in subordinate clauses, with Northern Lushootseed using and Southern Lushootseed using .

See Determiners for more information on this dialectical variation.

== Orthography ==
According to work published by Vi Hilbert and other Lushootseed-language specialists, Lushootseed uses a morphophonemic writing system meaning that it is a phonemic alphabet which does not change to reflect the pronunciation such as when an affix is introduced. The chart below is based on the Lushootseed Dictionary. Typographic variations such as and do not indicate phonemic distinctions. Capital letters are not used in Lushootseed.

Some older works based on the Dictionary of Puget Salish distinguishes between schwas that are part of the root word and those inserted through agglutination which are written in superscript.

The Tulalip Tribes of Washington&#x27;s Lushootseed Language Department created a display with nearly all the letters in the Lushootseed alphabet, sans the letter b̓, which is a rare sound which no words begin with.

See the external links below for resources.

==Vocabulary==

The Lushootseed language originates from the coastal region of Northwest Washington State and the Southwest coast of Canada. There are words in the Lushootseed language which are related to the environment and the fishing economy that surrounded the Salish tribes. The following tables show different words from different Lushootseed dialects relating to the salmon fishing and coastal economies.

<doc id="619517" wikidata="Q835450" url="?curid=619517" title="China's peaceful rise">
<text>&quot;China&#x27;s peaceful rise&quot;, currently referred to as &quot;China&#x27;s peaceful development&quot;, is an official policy and political slogan in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) implemented under former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Hu Jintao. It sought to assure the international community that China&#x27;s growing political, economic, and military power would not pose a threat to international peace and security.

Originally formulated by Zheng Bijian as part of a Ministry of State Security (MSS) influence operation, the term characterized China as a responsible world leader that avoids unnecessary international confrontation, emphasizes soft power, and vows that China is committed to its own internal issues and improving the welfare of its own people before interfering in world affairs. Furthermore, it sought to rebut the &quot;China threat theory&quot; and reestablish the view of China as a non-threatening world power, as historically Chinese empires were regarded as less aggressive.

Among Chinese authorities as well as academics, there was disagreement about the term—particularly a concern that the word &#x27;rise&#x27; might fuel perceptions that China was a threat to the current status quo. Therefore, since 2004, the term &quot;China&#x27;s peaceful development&quot; has been used by the Chinese leadership.

==Origins==
Many of the ideas behind the effort to promote the concept of the peaceful rise of the PRC came from the new security concept, which was formulated by think tanks in the PRC in the mid-1990s. During this time period, Chinese leaders became more careful with China&#x27;s international image in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, particularly American views of China&#x27;s growing role internationally.

The term itself was used in a speech given by the former Vice Principal of the Central Party School, Zheng Bijian, in late 2003 during the Boao Forum for Asia. Zheng had formulated the concept following a 2002 visit to the United States, where heard what he deemed as frequent and unsettling references to China as a threat. He coined the term after working with the MSS to study American attitudes toward China. Zheng returned to China and proposed a study to develop a theory of China&#x27;s peaceful rise. Premier Wen Jiabao became the first high-level leader to endorse the concept in December 2003, while speaking at Harvard University. It appears to be one of the first initiatives by the fourth generation of the leadership of the PRC, headed by Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao.

In Zheng&#x27;s speech he pointed out that in the past, a rise of a new power often resulted in drastic changes to global political structures, and even war (i.e. the hegemonic stability theory in international relations). He believed that this was because these powers &quot;chose the road of aggression and expansion, which will ultimately fail.&quot; Zheng stated that China did not seek conquest or to follow a militarized path of development, but instead to seek reciprocity and mutual benefit in its foreign relations.

However, there was disagreement about the term &#x27;peaceful rise&#x27; among the Chinese leadership and academia, particularly because the use of the word &#x27;rise&#x27; could fuel perceptions that China is a threat. At the 2004 session of the Bo&#x27;ao Forum, the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s general secretary Hu Jintao used instead the phrase China&#x27;s peaceful development. &#x27;Peaceful development&#x27; has since been the definition generally used by senior officials, with &#x27;peaceful rise&#x27; rarely heard.

Under the strategic paradigm of former CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin, China&#x27;s rapid development was viewed as a multipolarizing change that challenged the unipolarity of the world structure under the United States of America&#x27;s hegemony. In contrast, according to Guo (2006), the Chinese adaptation of a peaceful development strategy entails an effort to secure a favorable environment for development by avoiding direct confrontation that challenges the current unipolar world but still maintaining its multilateral approach.

The 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party made the &quot;Peaceful Development&quot; formulation official party doctrine.

==Main principle==
The term is used primarily to reassure the nations of Continental and East Asia as well as the United States that the rise of China&#x27;s military prominence and the growth of its economic strength will not pose a threat to peace and stability, and that other nations will benefit from China&#x27;s rising power and influence. According to Robert Suettinger, &quot;the concept of peaceful rise was initially intended as something of a propaganda campaign&quot; and &quot;should not necessarily be taken to have decisive significance for China&#x27;s foreign policy.&quot;

In diplomacy, the doctrine calls for less assertiveness in border disputes such as those concerning the Spratly Islands, Senkaku Islands, and South Tibet. China still has difficult relations with Japan and continues a military modernization program.

==Sino-American relations==

The end of the Jiang Zemin leadership marked a turning point in Sino-American relations. A pattern of cooperative coexistence became the new normal. &quot;The United States and China perceived that they needed each other because both were too large to be dominated, too special to be transformed, and too necessary to each other to be able to afford isolation.&quot; Chinese leader Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao brought a perspective that was unprecedented in the management of China&#x27;s development and in defining its role in the world. They represented the first crop of Chinese leaders with no personal experience with the Cultural Revolution and the first to assume power in a China that unambiguously was emerging as a great power. &quot;Coming to power during a long period of sustained domestic growth and in the wake of China&#x27;s entry into the international economic order, they assumed the helm of a China undeniably &quot;arriving&quot; as a world power, with interests in every corner of the globe.&quot;

According to Henry Kissinger in his book On China, Zheng Bijian provided the &quot;quasi-official&quot; policy statement for China in a 2005 Foreign Affairs article. Zheng promised that China had adopted a &quot;strategy...to transcend the traditional ways for great powers to emerge.&quot; China sought a &quot;new international political and economic order,&quot; but it was &quot;one that can be achieved through incremental reforms and the democratization of international relations.&quot; China would &quot;not follow the path of Germany leading up to World War I or those of Germany and Japan leading up to World War II, when these countries violently plundered resources and pursued hegemony. Neither will China follow the path of the great powers vying for global domination during the Cold War.&quot;

Australian analyst Alex Joske described the doctrine as disseminated by sustained Ministry of State Security influence operations in the U.S.

Washington responded by describing China as a &quot;responsible stakeholder&quot; in the international system. In a 2005 speech at the National Committee on United States—China Relations, Robert Zoellick, then Deputy Secretary of State, put forward the American response to Zheng&#x27;s article, which &quot;amounted to an invitation to China to become a privileged member, and shaper, of the international system.&quot;

State Councilor Dai Bingguo argues that China&#x27;s development is not some trick where it &#x27;hides its brightness and bides its time,&quot; or a naïve delusion that forfeits China&#x27;s advantages. &quot;Persisting with taking the path of peaceful development is not the product of a subjective imagination or of some kind of calculations. Rather, it is the result of our profound recognition that both the world today and China today have undergone tremendous changes as well as that China&#x27;s relations with the world today have also undergone great changes; hence it is necessary to make the best of the situation and adapt to the changes.&quot;

Dai rejects arguments that claim China will seek to dominate East Asia and the Greater Asia-Pacific or to displace the United States as the world&#x27;s preeminent power as &quot;pure myths&quot; that contradict China&#x27;s historical record and its current policies. He includes a striking invitation for the world to &quot;supervise&quot; China to confirm it would never seek hegemony: &quot;Comrade Deng Xiaoping once stated: If one day China should seek to claim hegemony in the world, then the people of the world should expose, oppose and even fight against it. On this point, the international community can supervise us.&quot;

==Government white papers==

The State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China issued a white paper &quot;China&#x27;s Peaceful Development Road&quot; in 2005, to define China&#x27;s peaceful development strategy. It has five chapters:

# China is the largest developing country, and economic development according to globalization is China&#x27;s main goal. China seeks a multipolar world rather than hegemony, and seeks relations with other countries based on the &quot;Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence&quot;.
# A peaceful international environment is essential for China&#x27;s development. China&#x27;s development is a major part of global development, as China has factored in world gains in poverty reduction, and strives to reduce its energy consumption. China&#x27;s growth has lessened the effects of the Great Recession.
# China will develop according to science. It will develop its domestic market and pave a new path to industrialisation that is cleaner, and makes more use of information technology and innovation by exploiting its human capital through education.
# China will remain open to the outside world for trade. It will promote organizations like the World Trade Organization, and support regional integration through institutions like the ASEAN–China Free Trade Area. It will address trade and exchange rate conflicts on an equal footing with other countries. China will invest abroad and maintain its large labor force and exports for use abroad.
# China will promote &quot;democracy in international relations&quot;; with countries interacting on an equal footing through dialog and multilateralism and not coercion. China will promote the full participation of developing countries in international affairs, and also help them develop themselves. There should be trust and not a &quot;Cold War mentality&quot;, and arms control and nuclear disarmament should be pursued. China will resolve its remaining border disputes peacefully.

Another white paper with the title &quot;China’s Peaceful Development&quot; was released in September 2011. It emphasized, &quot;The central goal of China&#x27;s diplomacy is to create a peaceful and stable international environment for its development.&quot;

<text>The All-Channel Receiver Act of 1962 (ACRA) (), commonly known as the All-Channels Act, was passed by the United States Congress in 1961, to allow the Federal Communications Commission to require that all television set manufacturers must include UHF tuners, so that new UHF-band TV stations (then channels 14 to 83) could be received by the public. This was a problem at the time since most affiliated stations of the Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) were well-established on VHF, while many local-only stations on UHF were struggling for survival.

The All-Channel Receiver Act provides that the Federal Communications Commission shall &quot;have authority to require that apparatus designed to receive television pictures broadcast simultaneously with sound be capable of adequately receiving all frequencies allocated by the Commission to television broadcasting.&quot; Under authority provided by the All Channel Receiver Act, the FCC adopted a number of technical standards to increase parity between the UHF and VHF television services, including a 14 dB maximum UHF noise figure for television receivers.

== History ==
While the first U.S. commercially licensed UHF television stations signed on as early as 1952, the majority of the 165 UHF stations to begin telecasting between 1952 and 1959 did not survive. UHF local stations of the 1950s were limited by the range their signals could supposedly travel, the lack of UHF tuners in most TV sets and difficulties in finding advertisers and TV network affiliations. Of the 82 new UHF TV stations in the United States broadcasting as of June 1954, only 24 remained on the air a year later.

Fourth-network operators such as the DuMont Television Network, forced to expand using UHF affiliates due to a lack of available VHF channels, were not viable and soon folded. The fraction of new TV receivers that were factory-equipped with all-channel tuners dropped from 20% in 1953 to 9.0% by 1958, a drop that was only partially compensated for by field upgrades or the availability of UHF converters for separate purchase. By 1961, with 83 commercial UHF stations still on-air, the number of new TVs capable of receiving UHF as well as VHF channels had fallen to a record low of 5.5% with a small number of viable stations situated in localities where a lack of available VHF frequencies had forced early expansion onto UHF.

While public educational television was available from 105 US stations by 1965, many of them in the already-crowded VHF spectrum, only 18 percent of the large number of UHF frequencies reserved for educational use in US cities were in active use. In areas where audiences had no UHF receivers, a station broadcasting above channel 13 was unlikely to survive.

Under the All-Channel Receiver Act, FCC regulations would ensure that all new TV sets sold in the U.S. after 1964 had built-in UHF tuners. By 1971, there would be more than 170 full-service UHF broadcast stations nationwide; the number of UHF stations would grow further to accommodate new television networks such as the Public Broadcasting Service (1970), Fox (1986), Univision (1986) and Telemundo (1987).

Today, UHF TV stations outnumber their long-established VHF counterparts, with more stations switching to physical UHF channels after the digital TV transition of 2009.

==Digital television==
The act has most recently been used in 2005-2007 ( and ) to require TV manufacturers to include ATSC-T (terrestrial TV) tuners for digital television, in any TV set that includes an NTSC analog TV tuner. This requirement has been phased-in during the mid-2000s, starting with the largest TV sets. By early 2007, every device sold that was capable of receiving over-the-air TV (including VCRs) was required to include an ATSC tuner. Millions of dollars in fines were imposed in 2008 by the Federal Communications Commission against vendors, including various name-brand retail chains such as Best Buy, Sears/Kmart and Walmart. Best Buy is disputing both the fines and the authority of the FCC to impose the penalties; Circuit City and Sears also disputed the charges.

In late March 2008, the Community Broadcasters Association filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seeking an injunction to halt the sale and distribution of DTV converter boxes, charging that their failure to include analog tuners or analog passthrough violates the All-Channel Receiver Act. Responding to CBA&#x27;s actions, the FCC and NTIA urged manufacturers to include the feature voluntarily in all converter boxes, and manufacturers responded by releasing a new generation of models with the feature. In early May 2008, the D.C. district court denied the CBA petition without comment, effectively telling the association that it had not exhausted all its efforts, and that there was not enough merit to take the case to the courts.

In July 2010, the FCC granted a waiver allowing Dell, LG, and Hauppauge to fail to include tuners for NTSC analog TV or standard ATSC digital TV in mobile television devices designed to receive ATSC-M/H signals. While all full-power stations have been forced to turn off their analog signals, and most low-power TV stations therefore have been forced to digital as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard, the vast majority of stations do not transmit a mobile-TV signal, which will leave viewers with these devices unable to receive most broadcasts. Because LPTV stations have already had their limited financial resources drained by having to buy and install new digital equipment, it is unlikely that any LPTV stations will be seen on mobile TV because of this waiver, which also applies to other companies.

== Broadcast radio ==

It has been proposed in 2009 to require HD Radio receivers to be included in all satellite radio (SDARS) receivers, in response to the monopoly created by the XM/Sirius merger. All three use proprietary systems, and there have been no considerations to require the inclusion of open standards like FMeXtra, DRM+, DAB+ or DMB, which are compatible anywhere outside of the United States. A notice of inquiry (a predecessor to a full rulemaking proceeding) is before the FCC as docket 08-172. A bill had been submitted to the U.S. House as the Radio All Digital Channel Receiver Act in 2008 but was not passed into law.

<doc id="619522" wikidata="Q791456" url="?curid=619522" title="Avro Lancastrian">
<text>The Avro 691 Lancastrian was a British and Canadian passenger and mail transport aircraft of the 1940s and 1950s developed from the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. The Lancastrian was basically a modified Lancaster bomber without armour or armament and with the gun turrets replaced by streamlined metal fairings, including a new nose section. The initial batch was converted directly from Lancasters; later batches were new builds.

==Design and development==
In 1943, Canada&#x27;s Victory Aircraft converted a Lancaster X bomber for civilian transport duties with Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA). (After the war Victory Aircraft was purchased by what became Avro Canada). This conversion was a success, resulting in eight additional Lancaster Xs being converted. The &quot;specials&quot; were powered by Packard-built Merlin 38 engines and featured a lengthened, streamlined nose and tail cone. Range was increased by two 400 gal (1,818 L) Lancaster long-range fuel tanks fitted as standard in the bomb bay. These Lancastrians were used by TCA on its Montreal–Prestwick route.

The modification of abundant military aircraft into desperately needed civilian transports was common in the United Kingdom in the immediate postwar period; the Handley Page Halton was a similar conversion of the Halifax heavy bomber.

==Operational history==
In 1945, deliveries commenced of 30 British-built Lancastrians for BOAC. On a demonstration flight on 23 April 1945, &quot;G-AGLF&quot; flew 13,500 mi (21,700 km) from England to Auckland, New Zealand in three days, 14 hours at an average speed of 220 mph (354 km/h).

The Lancastrian was fast, had a long range, and was capable of carrying a heavy load, but space inside was very limited as the Lancaster had been designed with space for its seven crew dispersed throughout the fuselage, and with the majority of the load being carried in the 33 ft (10.05 m) long bomb bay. Consequently, as passengers are bulky but low in weight, it was not suited to carry large numbers of passengers, but was suitable for mail and a small number of VIP passengers. BOAC used it for flights between England and Australia from 31 May 1945. It also served with the RAF; RAF Lancaster I serial number &quot;PD328&quot;, was converted to a Lancastrian and renamed &quot;Aries&quot;, as well as serving with Qantas and Flota Aérea Mercante Argentina.

Lancastrians were used during the Berlin Airlift to transport petrol; 15 aircraft made over 5,000 trips. In 1946 a Lancastrian operated by BSAA was the first aircraft to make a scheduled flight from the then-newly opened London Heathrow Airport.

===Lancastrian engine testbeds===
&quot;Data from:&quot; Avro Aircraft since 1908

With the advent of gas turbine engines there emerged a need to test the new engines in a controlled flight environment in well instrumented installations. An ideal candidate emerged as the Avro Lancastrian which could easily accommodate the test instrumentation as well as fly on the power of two piston engines if required. Several Lancastrians were allocated for engine test-bed work with turbojet engines replacing the outer Merlin engines or test piston engines in the inner nacelles. Fuel arrangements varied but could include kerosene jet fuel in outer wing tanks or fuselage tanks, with avgas carried in remaining fuel tanks.

The Aviation Safety Network, part of the Flight Safety Foundation, records 23 hull loss accidents involving the Lancastrian occurring between 1946 and 1964 resulting in a total of 81 fatalities.

Notable accidents include:
; Lancastrian &quot;G-AGLX&quot;

On 23 March 1946 Lancastrian &quot;G-AGLX&quot; was lost over the Indian Ocean en route between British Ceylon and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. All 10 on board died.
; Lancastrian &quot;G-AGWH&quot;, &quot;Star Dust&quot;

On 2 August 1947 Lancastrian &quot;G-AGWH&quot; &quot;Star Dust&quot; of British South American Airways was lost in the Andes en route from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Santiago, Chile. The probable cause of the crash was a navigation error due to the then-unknown effect of the fast-moving jetstream.
;Lancastrian &quot;T-102&quot;

On 11 December 1960 Lancastrian &quot;T-102&quot; of the Argentine Air Force crashed near San Andrés de Giles, Argentina. All 31 on board were killed. This was the worst accident involving this type of aircraft.
