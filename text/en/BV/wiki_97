<text>René Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou, marquis de Morangles (; 25 February 1714 – 29 July 1792) was a French lawyer, politician, and chancellor of France, (Prime Minister) whose attempts at reform signalled the failure of enlightened despotism in France. He is best known for his effort to destroy the system of parlements, which were powerful regional courts, in 1770–74. When King Louis XV died in 1774, the parlements were restored and Maupeou lost power.

==Early life==
He was born in Montpellier to a family ennobled in the sixteenth century as &quot;noblesse de robe&quot;, the eldest son of René Charles de Maupeou (1688–1775), who was president of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris from 1743 to 1757.

In 1744 he married a rich heiress, Anne de Roncherolles (1725–1752), a cousin of Madame d&#x27;Épinay, the friend of Rousseau who moved in the circles of the &quot;Philosophes&quot;. Entering public life, he was his father&#x27;s right hand in the conflicts between the &quot;parlement&quot; and Christophe de Beaumont, archbishop of Paris, who was supported by the court. Between 1763 and 1768, dates which cover the revision of the Calas case that Voltaire had championed and the trial of the comte de Lally, Maupeou was himself president of the &quot;parlement&quot;. In 1768, he became chancellor in succession to his father, who had held the office for twenty-four hours only, largely in order to permit him to retire with the prestigious title. With the disgrace of Choiseul, 24 December 1770, Maupeou was the chief minister.

He determined to support the royal authority against the &quot;parlement&quot;, the perennial block to reforms of the tax farming system or the privileges of the propertied classes, which in league with the provincial magistratures was seeking to arrogate to itself the functions of the states-general. He allied himself with the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon and the king&#x27;s mistress Madame du Barry, and secured for a creature of his own, the Abbé Terray, the office of comptroller-general. The struggle erupted over the trial of the case of the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon, ex-governor of Brittany, and of La Chalotais, &quot;procureur-général&quot; of the province, who had been imprisoned by the governor for accusations against his administration.

When the &quot;parlement&quot; showed signs of hostility against Aiguillon, Maupeou read letters patent from Louis XV annulling the proceedings. Louis replied to remonstrances from the &quot;parlement&quot; by a &quot;lit de justice&quot;, in which he demanded the surrender of the procedural minutes. On 27 November 1770 appeared the &quot;Édit de règlement et de discipline&quot;, which was promulgated by the chancellor, forbidding the union of the various branches of the &quot;parlement&quot; and correspondence with the provincial magistratures. It also made a strike on the part of the &quot;parlement&quot; punishable by confiscation of goods, and forbade further obstruction to the registration of royal decrees after the royal reply had been given to a first remonstrance. This edict the magistrates refused to register, and it was registered in a &quot;lit de justice&quot; held at Versailles on 7 December, whereupon the &quot;parlement&quot; was suspended in its functions.

==Coup==
After five summonses to return to their duties, the magistrates were surprised individually on the night of 19 January 1771 by musketeers, who required them to sign yes or no to a further request to return. Thirty-eight magistrates gave an affirmative answer, but on the exile of their former colleagues by &quot;lettres de cachet&quot;, they retracted and were also exiled. Maupeou installed the council of state to administer justice pending the establishment of six superior courts in the provinces and of a new &quot;parlement&quot; in Paris, in which the magistrature would no longer be a hereditary prerogative but become salaried officials appointed by the Crown. The &quot;cour des aides&quot; was next suppressed. Maupeou proposed to make the judicial system more uniform throughout the country, which was a patchwork of local judicatures.

Voltaire praised this revolution, applauding the suppression of the old hereditary magistrature, but by the aristocrats and the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot;, Maupeou&#x27;s policy was regarded as the triumph of tyranny. The remonstrances of the princes, of the nobles, and of the minor courts, were met by exile and suppression, but by the end of 1771, the new system of the &quot;parlements de Maupeou&quot; was established, and the Bar, which had offered a passive resistance, recommenced to plead. A renewed attempt was made to tax the privileged and exempted groups. But it was not merely the death of Louis XV in May 1774 that ruined the chancellor: Durand Echeverria characterized the dismissal of Maupeou as &quot;the inevitable liquidation of an exhausted expedient&quot;.

==Fall==
The immediate restoration of the &quot;parlements&quot; by Louis XVI was followed by a renewal of the quarrels between the new king and the magistrature. Maupeou and Terray were replaced on 24 August 1774 by Miromesnil and then by Malesherbes, recalled from his exile in 1775 to be Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi, and by the economist Turgot. Maupeou is said to have remarked, &quot;I had won for the king a case that has lasted three hundred years. He wishes to lose it again; he is the master of it.&quot;

Maupeou lived in retreat, still holding the office of Chancellor (abolished 1 July 1790) until his death at Thuit (Eure) in 1792, having lived to see the overthrow of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;. His work, in so far as it was directed towards the separation of the judicial and political functions and to the reform of the abuses attaching to a hereditary magistrature, was subsequently endorsed by the Revolution. He had aimed at securing absolute power for Louis XV, but his intrigues and the violence of his judicial actions were in reality a serious blow to the monarchy. &quot;By pressing the issue of sovereignty to an ultimate confrontation in this way,&quot; remarks Keith Michael Baker of Maupeou&#x27;s staffing his remodelled courts with men willing to exercise judicial functions within limits imposed by the royal will, &quot;he undermined in practice exactly that belief in a constitutional middle ground between liberty and despotism that Guillaume-Joseph Saige had been concerned to deny in theory&quot;.

==Issue==
He had two sons:
#René Ange Augustin de Maupeou (1746–1794), who became &quot;maître de camp&quot; of the .
#Charles Victor René de Maupeou (1749–1789), who became &quot;maître des requêtes&quot;.

<text>The Centre Steer is the name given by enthusiasts to the prototype of the Land Rover 4x4 automobile. Being a prototype, only one example was built and the production vehicle differed significantly in many ways. Developed in late 1947 by the Rover Motor Co., the Land Rover was intended to be an agricultural vehicle inspired by the wartime Willys Jeep.

==Design and build==
Raw materials for car building were allocated by the government based on the company&#x27;s export performance (as this earned much-needed trade revenue for post-war Britain). Because of this the Land Rover was designed from the outset to be exported to the British Empire and Commonwealth. Rover viewed this 4x4 as a stopgap to get production running and so the company could return to building luxury cars. The Land Rover had to be developed and produced with minimal outlay.

The prototype was produced in September 1947. Its most distinctive feature was the centrally-mounted steering wheel, with passenger seats on either side. This was done for three reasons:
#the Land Rover was designed as an agricultural vehicle capable of performing jobs also done by tractors. Tractors had centrally mounted steering and this system would be familiar to farmers;
#with the drive in the centre of the vehicle, the space on either side could be used as additional storage space for cargo if the passenger seats were removed. The space could also be used for mounting equipment such as a generator or pump powered by the vehicle&#x27;s Power Take Off (PTO) system from the main gearbox, which was under the seats;
#the centre-steer layout removed the need to produce the vehicle in both right- and left-hand drive versions, saving money in production.

The vehicle shared the Jeep&#x27;s 80 inch (2 m) wheelbase that would be carried over to the final production vehicle. It had more complex body panels, with a more curved front end and a Jeep-like rear body tub (the production vehicle used generally squarer, flatter panels for ease of production).

The Centre Steer used a Rover 1.6 litre 4-cylinder petrol engine of 50 horsepower (37 kW). This was coupled to a 4-speed manual gearbox from the Rover P3 saloon. This unit was coupled to a Willys/Ford 2-speed transfer gearbox taken from a Jeep. This not only allowed the selection of a lower set of &#x27;crawler&#x27; gears but controlled the selection of drive to the front axle as well. The production 1948 Land Rover used the P3 gearbox, but an entirely different transfer box, designed and built by Rover, was fitted. This incorporated a Rover &#x27;freewheel&#x27; mechanism to provide a permanent 4-wheel-drive system. The freewheel could be locked out to ensure full traction at both axles when off-road.

The Centre Steer was used as a concept of the basic design and mechanical elements and was used for promotional photographs for the first Sales Brochure, however these pictures were heavily airbrushed to resemble a normal early Land Rover. The pre-production vehicles quickly developed, without the central steering and complex body panels. The design team felt the centre steering was somewhat awkward to use and impractical in certain circumstances. The concept stayed in initial development drawings of the &#x27;Land Rover&#x27; program in October 1947. However, by December 1947 the normal Land Rover had developed on the drawing board to be a conventional right- and left-hand drive vehicle.

The centre-steer vehicle was used off-road in and around Rover&#x27;s Solihull works. Pictures exist of the vehicle seen ploughing and driving a threshing machine on a farm, though most of these photos are static publicity photographs.

Research in 2011 turned up some drawings of the Land Rover design between the Centre Steer and the normal Land Rover. An article on this vehicle, the 1947 Land Rover mockup, was in the Land Rover Register 1948 to 53 April 2011 Bulletin and shows that the Land Rover Mockup was initially drawn up with central steering.

==Present day status==
It is not known if the Centre Steer prototype still exists. Many people, including most of the original design team, believe it was broken up shortly after production of the final Series I design started in 1948. Others say it was rescued and remains in some isolated farmyard barn waiting to be discovered. The discovery of the Centre Steer remains a &#x27;Holy Grail&#x27; to many Land Rover enthusiasts. New research has revealed that the final Land Rover design was well advanced by early December 1947. The Centre Steer was left for use in publicity photographs that were used in the first sales brochure, though heavily air brushed to look like the production vehicle.

In 2004, a Land Rover enthusiast in the United Kingdom, Mr. Bill Hayfield, constructed a replica centre-steer vehicle after much study of remaining photographs of the original. The fully working vehicle demonstrated both the practicalities and drawbacks to the novel design. The replica used exactly the same engine and gearbox. The necessities of building such a vehicle in a home workshop also pointed towards ways the Rover company would have built their vehicle without complex pressing and cutting machinery-such as the creation of curves on the bodywork by cutting slots in a straight sheet, applying pressure to the metal, allowing it to bend at an angle allowed by the expansion slots, then welding up the slots to form a solid, strong body panel. Many previously speculated on the feasibility of constructing a centrally-mounted steering system. Mr. Hayfield simply ran a chain drive from the steering column in the centre to the steering relay mounted under the left-hand wing, as used on the Jeep. The rest of the steering system was also the Jeep&#x27;s recirculating ball and trackrod system.

<text>Christophe de Beaumont du Repaire (26 July 1703 – 12 December 1781) was a French cleric who belonged to a cadet branch of the Les Adrets and Saint-Quentin branches of the illustrious Dauphin family of Beaumont. He became Bishop of Bayonne in 1741, then Archbishop of Vienne in 1745, and in 1746, at the age of forty-three, Archbishop of Paris. An austere man, with no wish for glory, he had to be summoned three times by Louis XV before he would leave his diocese of Vienne and move to Paris.

==History==
=== The Struggle Against Jansenism ===
Beaumont is noted for his struggle with the Jansenists. To force them to accept the bull Unigenitus (1713) which condemned their doctrines, he ordered the priests of his diocese to withhold sacraments from those who would not recognize the bull, and to deny funeral rites to those who had confessed to a Jansenist priest. This measure had severe, damning implications for Jansenists, provoking widespread outcry against such intolerance from the Jansenists themselves, the Philosophes, the parlements, and the larger public.

While other bishops sent Beaumont their adhesion to his crusade, the Parlement of Paris threatened to confiscate his temporalities. Louis XV forbade the &quot;Parlement&quot; to interfere in these spiritual questions, and upon its proving obdurate it was exiled (18 September 1753). The royal chamber, which was substituted, having failed to carry on the administration of justice properly, the king was obliged to recall the &quot;parlement&quot;, and the archbishop was sent into honorable exile to Conflans, where he remained from August 1754 until October 1757. Efforts were made to induce him to resign the active duties of his see to a coadjutor, he refused despite the most tempting offers - including a cardinal&#x27;s hat. As the dispute between the king and the Parlements continued, de Beaumont was exiled from Paris a second time, from January 1758 to October 1759. He eventually returned, having conceded none of his principles. &#x27;Let them erect a scaffold in the midst of the court&#x27; he said, &#x27;I would ascend it to maintain my rights, fulfil my duties and obey the laws of my conscience.&#x27; 

To his polemic against the Jansenists he added an attack on the &quot;philosophes&quot;, and issued a formal mandatory letter condemning Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Rousseau replied in his masterly &quot;Lettre a M. de Beaumont&quot; (1762), in which he insists that freedom of discussion in religious matters is essentially more religious than the attempt to impose belief by force.

===Defending the Authority of the Church===
Archbishop de Beaumont was a forthright and powerful voice in defence of Church authority and an opponent of anything that he saw as undermining it. This often put him at odds with statesmen and thinkers alike. He was strongly opposed to the project of Diderot, D’Alembert and others to publish the Encyclopédie, and he appointed the censors who required the modification or deletion of articles which were deemed contrary to Church teaching. At de Beaumont&#x27;s request, volume 2 of the Encyclopédie was banned in 1752 because it contained material deemed to be heretical. He was so strongly opposed to Madame de Pompadour that he said he should like to see her burned, and he refused her permission to receive the sacraments in her chapel.
In 1762 the Society of Jesus was suppressed in France, and de Beaumont realised that if the king and the Parlements were able to take such a drastic step the Church itself was in potential danger. In October 1763 he published a pastoral instruction condemning the encroachment of civil authority upon the spiritual. The Parlement of Paris responded by ordering the public hangman to burn the book and summoned the Archbishop to appear before it. Louis XV, anxious to avoid a major confrontation, once again banished de Beaumont from his diocese.

On 21 July 1773 the international campaign against the Jesuit Order reached the point where Pope Clement XIV issued the brief &quot;Dominus ac Redemptor&quot; which formally abolished the Order around the world. The brief explicitly indicated that the reason for the abolition was to satisfy the King of France and the other Bourbon rulers of Europe. Archbishop de Beaumont scornfully rejected the Papal brief and wrote the following to the Pope:

&quot;‘This brief which destroys the Company of Jesus is nothing other than an isolated and particular judgement, pernicious, reflecting little honour on the Papal tiara and deleterious to the glory of the Church and to the glory and propagation of the orthodox (i.e. Catholic) faith….. Holy Father, it is not possible for me to commit the Clergy to the acceptance of the said brief. I would not be heard on this point were I wretch enough to lend my ministry to it, which I should be dishonouring.’&quot; 

De Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;Mandements, lettres et instructions pastorales&quot; were published in two volumes in 1780, the year before his death.

<text>Karabük is a city in the Black Sea region of Turkey. It is the seat of Karabük Province and Karabük District. Its population is 125,403 (2022). The town lies at an elevation of .

Karabük was built in the 1930s as the seat of the iron and steel industry of Turkey, and thus is prone to the hazardous effects of air pollution. Karabük lies in a location near Filyos River formed by the merge of Araç and Soğanlı rivers.

==Name==
There are no known records of the origin of its name; in Turkish &quot;kara&quot; means &quot;black&quot; and &quot;bük&quot; means &quot;bush&quot; or &quot;blackberry bush&quot; (&quot;bramble&quot;). So &quot;Karabük&quot; means &quot;blackbush&quot;.

==History==
Karabük is situated on an important trade route between Amasra on the coast and central Anatolia. The history of the city goes back to the early years of the Turkish Republic, when it was a small sub-village formed by 13 houses in the Öğlebeli village of Safranbolu. There was also a small train station on the Ankara–Zonguldak route. The town started to develop with the industrialization of the country. One of the first steel factories of the Republic was built here in 1939, after which it grew rapidly and incorporated Öğlebeli village as a quarter. Karabük became a municipality and then a township in the Safranbolu district in 1941. It became a district center in 1953 and a provincial center in 1995.

Hadrianapolis (now Eskipazar), is an ancient city from the Roman Empire of the 4th century, located about 30km (68km by road) from Karabük. There are many fountains, churches, and Roman baths. Although most of it is recently excavated, illegal excavations which have been going on for many years and have damaged Eskipazar&#x27;s chances of becoming a major tourist attraction.

==Climate==
Karabük has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) or a relatively warm oceanic climate (Trewartha: &quot;Do&quot;) with hot, humid summers and chilly, wet winters.

==Economy==
Karabük has its own resources of dolomite and limestone, while coal and manganese is brought from Zonguldak and iron ore from Divriği. This allows a varied, yet basic industry in Karabük, including a coking plant, blast furnaces, a foundry and tube works. There are also chemical plants that produce sulfuric acid and phosphates. Nearby are the Zonguldak coal fields.

One of the major steel producers in Turkey, namely Kardemir (&quot;Karabük Iron and Steel Works&quot;), is located in Karabük.

<text>Grachan Moncur III (June 3, 1937 – June 3, 2022) was an American jazz trombonist. He was the son of jazz bassist Grachan Moncur II and the nephew of jazz saxophonist Al Cooper.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, United States, (his paternal grandfather was from the Bahamas) and raised in Newark, New Jersey, Grachan Moncur III began playing the cello at the age of nine, and switched to the trombone when he was 11. In high school, he attended the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina, the private school where Dizzy Gillespie had studied. While still at school, he began sitting in with touring jazz musicians on their way through town, including Art Blakey and Jackie McLean, with whom he formed a lasting friendship.

After high school, Moncur toured with Ray Charles (1959–62), Art Farmer and Benny Golson&#x27;s Jazztet (1962), and Sonny Rollins. He took part in two Jackie McLean albums for Blue Note in 1963, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; and &quot;Destination... Out!&quot;, to which he also contributed the bulk of compositions. He recorded two albums of his own for Blue Note, &quot;Evolution&quot; (1963) with Jackie McLean and Lee Morgan, and &quot;Some Other Stuff&quot; (1964) with Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter.

Moncur joined Archie Shepp&#x27;s ensemble, and recorded with other avant-garde players such as Marion Brown, Beaver Harris and Roswell Rudd (another free jazz trombonist). During a stay in Paris in the summer of 1969, he recorded two albums as a leader for the BYG Actuel label, &quot;New Africa&quot; and &quot;Aco Dei de Madrugada&quot;, as well as appearing as a sideman on other releases of the label. In 1974, the Jazz Composer&#x27;s Orchestra commissioned him to write &quot;Echoes of Prayer&quot; (1974), a jazz symphony featuring a full orchestra plus vocalists and jazz soloists. His sixth album as a leader, &quot;Shadows&quot; (1977) was released only in Japan. He was subsequently plagued by health problems and copyright disputes and recorded only rarely. Through the 1980s, he recorded with Cassandra Wilson (1985), played occasionally with the Paris Reunion Band and Frank Lowe, appeared on Big John Patton&#x27;s &quot;Soul Connection&quot; (1983), but mostly concentrated on teaching. In 2004, he re-emerged with a new album, &quot;Exploration&quot;, on Capri Records featuring Moncur&#x27;s compositions arranged by Mark Masters for an octet including Tim Hagans and Gary Bartz.

Moncur died from cardiac arrest on June 3, 2022, his 85th birthday, at his home in Newark, New Jersey.

<text>Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally, baron de Tollendal (13 January 17029 May 1766) was a French general of Irish Jacobite ancestry. Lally commanded French forces, including two battalions of his own red-coated Regiment of Lally of the Irish Brigade, in India during the Seven Years&#x27; War. After a failed attempt to capture Madras he lost the Battle of Wandiwash to British forces under Eyre Coote and then was forced to surrender the remaining French post at Pondicherry. 

After time spent as a prisoner of war in Britain, Lally voluntarily returned to France to face charges where he was beheaded for his alleged failures in India. Ultimately the jealousies and disloyalties of other officers, together with insufficient resources and limited naval support prevented Lally from securing India for France. In 1778, he was publicly exonerated by Louis XVI from his alleged crime.

== Life ==
He was born at Romans-sur-Isère, Dauphiné, the son of Sir Gerald Lally, an Irish Jacobite from Tuam, County Galway, who married a French lady of noble family. His title is derived from the Lally ancestral home, Castel Tullendally in County Galway, where the Lallys (originally O&#x27;Mullally) were prominent members of the Gaelic aristocracy who could trace their ancestry back to the second-century High King of Ireland, Conn of the Hundred Battles.

Entering the French army in 1721, he served in the War of the Polish Succession against Austria; he was present at the Battle of Dettingen, and commanded the &quot;regiment de Lally&quot; in the famous Irish brigade at Fontenoy (May 1745). He was made a brigadier on the field by Louis XV.

He was a staunch Jacobite and in 1745 accompanied Charles Edward Stuart (then known in Jacobite circles as the Prince Regent, or Bonnie Prince Charlie) to Scotland, serving as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; at the Battle of Falkirk Muir. Escaping to France, he served with Marshal Saxe in the Low Countries, and at the Siege of Maastricht (1748) was made a &quot;maréchal de camp&quot;.

When war broke out with Britain again in 1756, Lally was appointed governor-general of French India and commanded a French expedition to India, made up of four battalions, two of which were from his own Regiment of Lally of the Irish Brigade. He reached Pondicherry in April 1758, and within six weeks had pushed the British back from the coast to Madras (in modern-day Chennai), the headquarters of the English East India Company.

He was a man of courage and a capable general, but his pride and ferocity made him unpopular with his officers and men. He was unsuccessful in an attack on Tanjore, and as he lacked French naval support he had to retire from the Siege of Madras upon the arrival of the British fleet. He was defeated by Sir Eyre Coote at the Battle of Wandiwash, and besieged in Pondicherry, where he was forced to capitulate in 1761.

== Trial and execution ==

Lally was sent as a prisoner of war to England. Public opinion in France was very hostile, blaming him for the defeat by the British, and there were widespread calls for Lally to be put on trial. While in London, he heard that he was accused in France of treason, and insisted, against advice, on returning on parole to stand trial. He was kept prisoner for nearly two years before the trial began in 1764 and when the Advocate General of the Parlement of Paris, Joly de Fleury, began the prosecution, Lally had not received any documentation of the charges, and was not allowed a defence lawyer. Throughout the trial, which lasted for two years, Lally fought against Joly de Fleury&#x27;s charges but on 6 May 1766 he was convicted and sentenced to be beheaded by Charles-Henri Sanson.

Lally made an attempt at suicide after his sentencing, and three days after his conviction he was gagged to prevent him from protesting his innocence further. He was transported in a garbage cart to be beheaded at the Place de Grève. The memoirs of the Sanson family record many details of the execution. According to the Sansons, after Lally said &quot;And now, you can strike!&quot; Charles Henri raised his weapon but failed to sever the old man&#x27;s head in one blow. Lally reportedly rose to his feet, and Charles Henri&#x27;s father intervened to complete the execution hastily as he promised Lally 35 years prior to this day. It is reported that Charles Jean-Baptiste Sanson finished Lally with a single strike after immediately recovering from the stroke-like condition that plagued him for years. It is highly unlikely that Charles Jean-Baptiste Sanson regained his strength to save the day. A piece written by Dr. Louis, as cited in Daniel Arasse&#x27;s &quot;The Guillotine and the Terror,&quot; recounts that during the execution, Lally knelt blindfolded and Charles-Henri Sanson struck him on the back of the neck. The blow failed to separate the head from the body, causing Lally to fall forwards. Finally, the head was detached from the body with four or five saber blows, which was witnessed with horror. 

==Progeny==
By one Felicity Crofton, Lally had a legitimised son and heir, Trophime-Gérard, later Marquis de Lally-Tollendal, a distinguished French statesman who (as further described below) subsequently devoted much time and energy to the rehabilitation of his father&#x27;s memory. Lally also had a natural daughter, Henrietta (or Harriet), who lived in Madras and died on 9 September 1836.

==Voltaire&#x27;s efforts at rehabilitation==
Voltaire knew Lally personally, and had no liking for him. As he had investments in the East India Company, he was concerned &#x27;this Irish hothead&#x27; might not be good for the shareholders when he was sent out to India. When he heard of his execution, he wrote to one friend, &quot;I knew Lally-Tollendal for an absurd man, violent, ambitious, capable of pillage and abuse of power; but I should be astonished if he was a traitor&quot;, and to another he wrote, &quot;I have just been reading up on the tragedy of poor Lally. I can easily see that Lally got himself detested by all the officers and all the inhabitants of Pondicherry, but in all the submissions to the trial there is no appearance of embezzlement, nor of treason.&quot; Voltaire had taken up a number of campaigns against miscarriages of justice, most famously that of Jean Calas. His work to expose injustice and abuse of process was often hindered by the unwillingness of the courts and other authorities to release evidence, statements, and court records. In this case too, although Voltaire wanted to investigate further, he was unable to penetrate the institutional secrecy of the court for the time being.

Voltaire was able to take no further action until in 1770 he was approached for help by Lally&#x27;s natural son Gérard de Lally-Tollendal. There is an account that the shame of military failure was originally so great that this son was brought up in total ignorance of who his father had been, and only inadvertently discovered the truth of his background at the age of fifteen. However this account cannot be true, as the son was fifteen when his father was executed, so his origins must have been concealed for other reasons. Voltaire offered what assistance he could, but the campaign to release the court documents was painfully slow.

Louis XV tried to throw the responsibility for what was undoubtedly a judicial murder on his ministers and the public, but his policy needed a scapegoat, and he was probably well content not to exercise his authority to save an almost friendless foreigner. The family records of his executioner stated that, while the charge of treason was clearly baseless, those of abuse of power, violence against the administrators of the colony and his soldiers, and cruelty to the natives, had ample witnesses. Lally had so impeached his officers and administrators of the colony that they could only feel safe by his condemnation and death.

When Louis XVI came to the throne in 1774 there was more inclination towards clemency. Still, it took discussion in thirty-two sessions before, in 1778, the Royal Council agreed to annul the proceedings against Lally, though the case still had to be referred to the Parlement of Rouen for formal overturning. On 24 May 1778, less than a week before he died, Voltaire learned that Gérard de Lally-Tollendal had been given leave to appeal. Deeply moved, Voltaire wrote to him: &quot;The dying man has been revived by learning this great news; he embraces M. de Lally very tenderly; he sees that the king is the defender of justice. He will die content.&quot; It was the last letter he wrote.

The sentence was not overturned until 1781, and the conviction itself was never cleared.

When the case was considered by the Parlement de Paris, the orator Jean-Jacques d&#x27;Eprémesnil acted as spokesman of Parlement and refused to consider any rehabilitation for Lally.

<doc id="632709" wikidata="Q1888226" url="?curid=632709" title="Racing slick">
<text>A racing slick or slick tyre is a type of tyre that has a smooth tread used mostly in auto racing. The first production slick tyre was developed by M&amp;H Tires in the early 1950s for use in drag racing. By eliminating any grooves cut into the tread, such tyres provide the largest possible contact patch to the road, and maximize dry traction for any given tyre dimension. Slick tyres are used on race tracks and in road racing, where acceleration, steering and braking require maximum traction from each wheel. Slick tyres are typically used on only the driven (powered) wheels in drag racing, where the only concern is maximum traction to put power to the ground, and are not used in rallying.

Slick tyres are not suitable for use on common road vehicles, which must be able to operate in all weather conditions. They are used in auto racing where competitors can choose different tyres based on the weather conditions and can often change tyres during a race.

==Performance==

Two stress mechanisms produce tyre grip:
* Indentation of the viscoelastic tyre rubber adapting to the texture of the road surface
* Molecular adhesion at the interface between the tyre rubber and the road surface

Slick tyres can provide far more traction than grooved tyres on dry roads, but typically have far less traction than grooved tyres under wet conditions. Wet roads severely diminish the traction because of aquaplaning due to water trapped between the tyre contact area and the road surface. Grooved tyres are designed to remove water from the contact area through the grooves, thereby maintaining traction even in wet conditions.

Since there is no tread pattern, slick tyre tread does not deform much under load. The reduced deformation allows the tyre to be constructed of softer compounds without excessive overheating and blistering. Modern day slick tyres have now developed particular performance qualities in a specific window of temperatures, becoming sticky when accumulating enough heat, and thus give much greater adhesion to the road surface, but they also have lower treadwear ratings; &quot;i.e.&quot; they wear out much more quickly than the harder rubber tyres used for driving on the streets. It is not uncommon for drivers in some auto sports to wear out multiple sets of tyres during a single day&#x27;s driving.

==Drag racing slicks==

The first drag racing slick was developed by M&amp;H Tires (Marvin &amp; Harry Tires) in the early 1950s. It was the only company in the world that produced and sold original drag racing tyres.

Drag racing slicks vary in size, from slicks used on motorcycles to very wide ones used on &quot;top fuel&quot; dragsters. For &quot;closed wheel&quot; cars, often the car must be modified merely to account for the size of the slick, raising the body on the rear springs for the height of narrower slicks, or replacing the rear wheel housings with very wide &quot;tubs&quot; and narrowing the rear axle to allow room for the wider varieties of tyres. Open-wheel dragsters are freed from any such constraints, and can go to enormous tyre sizes. Some use very low pressures to maximize the tread contact area, producing the typical sidewall appearance which leads to their being termed &quot;wrinkle wall&quot; slicks. Inner tubes are typically used, to ensure that the air does not suddenly leak catastrophically as the tyre deforms under the stress of launching.

&quot;Wrinkle Wall&quot; slicks are now specifically designed for the special requirements of drag racing, being constructed in such a way as to allow the sidewall to be twisted by the torque applied at launch, softening the initial start and thus reducing the chances of breaking traction. As speed builds, the centrifugal force generated by the tyre&#x27;s rotation &quot;unwraps&quot; the sidewall, returning the energy to the car&#x27;s acceleration. Additionally, it causes the tyres to expand radially, increasing their diameter and effectively creating a taller gear ratio, allowing a higher top speed with the same transmission gearing.

===Cheater slicks===

Since completely slick tyres are outlawed on most roads due to their inability to handle wet pavement, the &quot;cheater slick&quot; became a popular item in the hot rod world in the 1960s; a typical slick type tyre, but engraved with the absolute minimum amount of tread grooves required to satisfy legal requirements. Since then, however, tyre development has progressed greatly, so that today&#x27;s hot rod street cars typically use wide, grooved tyres which perform better than the slicks of the past; while the cheater slicks available today, both for nostalgic appearance of street cars and for competition use in classes where legal street tyres are required, have followed their own line of development, diverging from true slick tyre construction to become a distinct tyre design in themselves.

==R compound tyres (grooved slicks)==
The development in cheaper slick technology has affected the development of tyres for racing series other than drag racing as well. When other forms of auto racing similarly instituted classes which require DOT approved street tyres, some manufacturers similarly began to market tyres which superficially resembled their high performance street tyres, but with the least tread pattern permissible and with very soft, sticky rubber, intended specifically for competition because the soft tread would wear too quickly for street use. These became known as &quot;R compound tyres&quot;. With additional years of progress, this class of tyre has followed its own line of development, to the point where they have little in common with true street tyres of the same brand. This has led to new classes of racing which require not only DOT approval, but also a minimum treadwear rating, in an effort to eliminate the R compound tyres from competition and require &quot;true&quot; street tyres.

==Formula One==
In Formula One, slick tyres were introduced by Firestone at the 1971 Spanish Grand Prix. They were banned from the 1998 to 2008 seasons. Dry weather tyres with mandatory circumferential grooves intended to reduce total grip and reduce cornering speeds were used, but were still often referred to as &quot;slicks&quot; as the grooves were not intended to disperse water and could not be used effectively in wet conditions. Slick tyres were reintroduced from the 2009 season.

==Bicycle tyres==
In contrast, many bicycle tyres made for street use are slick. Aquaplaning does not present a problem for bicycles tyres due to their narrower width, higher pressure, lower speed, and circular cross section (due to the need to lean the bicycle in turns); the bicycle tyre can penetrate the water layer to contact the road much more easily. In practice, grooved bicycle tyres do not outperform slick tyres on wet roads. However, many low and medium performance bicycle tyres have substantial tread depth, because the bicycles are designed with off-road excursions in mind: in dirt, gravel or sand, the tread pattern provides significantly improved traction. In addition, high-performance bicycle tyres, although designed for road use only, often have a very fine tread pattern, which appears to provide no difference in performance versus a slick tyre and is only there for marketing purposes and as a tyre-wear indicator. This is clear not only from direct testing of tyres, but also from the fact that the texture of the road is itself coarser than the minimal tread pattern on these tyres. Some grooveless designs have small &quot;holes&quot; or dimples embedded in the tread as a tyre-wear indicator. This is similar to automobile tyre-wear indicator bars, which contact the road when the tyre is worn to a low tread amount, making the tyre noisy on the road.

<text>Ralph McPherran Kiner (October 27, 1922 – February 6, 2014) was an American Major League Baseball player and broadcaster. An outfielder, Kiner played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, and Cleveland Indians from 1946 through 1955.

Following his retirement, Kiner served from 1956 through 1960 as general manager of the Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres. He also served as an announcer for the New York Mets from the team&#x27;s inception until his death. Though injuries forced his retirement from active play after 10 seasons, Kiner led all of his National League contemporaries in home runs between 1946 and 1952. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975.

After Kiner&#x27;s death, baseball writer Marty Noble called him &quot;one of baseball&#x27;s genuine and most charming gentlemen.&quot;

==Early life==
Kiner was born in Santa Rita, New Mexico to Beatrice ( Grayson) and Ralph Macklin Kiner. His father died when Ralph was four and his mother took a job in Alhambra, California where Kiner was subsequently raised. He was of Pennsylvania Dutch and Scots-Irish descent, with German-Jewish ancestry through his maternal grandmother. Kiner graduated from Alhambra High School in Alhambra, California.

===World War II Service===
Kiner served as a U.S. Navy pilot during World War II.

Kiner was inducted into the Navy during the spring of 1943. As a cadet, he attended St. Mary&#x27;s Pre-Flight School in California and earned his pilot&#x27;s wings and commission at Corpus Christi, Texas in December 1944. Kiner flew PBM Mariner flying boats on submarine patrols from Naval Air Station (NAS) Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii, accumulating 1,200 flying hours. Kiner enlisted the day after Pearl Harbor.

==Playing career (1946–1955)==
Kiner made his major league debut on April 12, 1946, with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He finished the season with 23 home runs, but 109 strikeouts. After the season, the Pirates convinced future Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg not to retire. Greenberg gave Kiner hours of instruction, and in 1947, Kiner led the major leagues with 51 home runs while striking out fewer than 100 times.

Many of Kiner&#x27;s homers were hit into a shortened left-field and left-center-field porch at Forbes Field (originally built for Greenberg and known in the press as &quot;Greenberg Gardens&quot;); the porch was retained for Kiner and redubbed &quot;Kiner&#x27;s Korner&quot;. Kiner would later use &quot;Kiner&#x27;s Korner&quot; as the title of his post-game TV show in New York.

In 1949, Kiner topped his 1947 total with 54 home runs, falling just two short of Hack Wilson&#x27;s then-National League record. It was the highest total in the major leagues from 1939 to 1960, and the highest National League total from 1931 to 1997. It made Kiner the first National League player with two 50 plus home run seasons. Kiner also matched his peak of 127 RBIs. From 1947 to 1951, Kiner topped 40 home runs and 100 RBIs each season. Through 2011 he was one of seven major leaguers to have had at least four 30-HR, 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard and Ryan Braun.

Kiner&#x27;s string of seasons leading the league in home runs reached seven in 1952, when he hit 37. This also was the last of a record six consecutive seasons in which he led Major League Baseball in home runs, all under the guidance of manager Billy Meyer and Pirate great Honus Wagner. He was selected to participate in the All-Star Game in six straight seasons, 1948 to 1953.

The equally famous &quot;Home run hitters drive Cadillacs and singles hitters drive Fords,&quot; frequently misattributed to Kiner himself, was, by his own account, actually coined by teammate Fritz Ostermueller. Footage of Kiner hitting a home run in Forbes Field can be seen in the 1951 film &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot;.

On June 4, 1953, Kiner was sent to the Chicago Cubs as part of a ten-player trade. The Pirates traded Kiner, Joe Garagiola, George Metkovich, and Howie Pollet to the Cubs in exchange for Bob Addis, Toby Atwell, George Freese, Gene Hermanski, Bob Schultz, Preston Ward, and $150,000. This was largely due to continued salary disputes with Pirates general manager Branch Rickey, who reportedly told Kiner, &quot;We finished last with you, we can finish last without you.&quot;

Kiner played the rest of 1953 and all of 1954 with the Cubs, finishing his career with the Cleveland Indians in 1955. A back injury forced him to retire at the age of 32, finishing his career with 369 home runs, 1,015 runs batted in and a .279 lifetime batting average. He hit better than .300 three times, with a career best .313 with the Pirates in 1947.

==Broadcasting career (1961–2013)==
In 1961, Kiner entered the broadcast booth for the Chicago White Sox. The following year, Kiner, Lindsey Nelson, and Bob Murphy began broadcasting the games of the expansion New York Mets on WOR-TV in New York City. The trio rotated announcing duties. Kiner also hosted a post-game show known as &quot;Kiner&#x27;s Korner&quot; on WOR-TV. Nationally, he helped call the Mets&#x27; appearance in the 1969 and 1973 World Series for NBC Radio. He won a local Emmy Award for his broadcasting work.

Kiner was known for his occasional malapropisms, usually connected with getting people&#x27;s names wrong, such as calling broadcasting partner Tim McCarver as &quot;Tim MacArthur&quot; and calling Gary Carter &quot;Gary Cooper&quot;. He even once called himself &quot;Ralph Korner&quot;.

Despite a bout with Bell&#x27;s palsy, which left him with slightly slurred speech, Kiner continued broadcasting for 53 seasons. Kiner&#x27;s tenure with the Mets was the third-longest for an active broadcaster with a single team as of his final season. He is the third longest-tenured broadcaster in baseball history, trailing only Los Angeles Dodgers announcers Vin Scully (1950–2016) and Jaime Jarrín (1959–2022). His traditional home run call—&quot;It is gone, goodbye,&quot; was a signature phrase in baseball.

As illness reduced his appearances, Kiner featured less frequently on SportsNet New York (SNY) and WPIX, which currently televise Mets games. During these visits (usually once a week), regular announcers Gary Cohen, Keith Hernandez, and Ron Darling would welcome Kiner as he shared stories of the Golden Age of baseball, as well as the contemporary game. During his final season in 2013, he was the oldest active announcer in Major League Baseball.

==Personal life==

Partly because Hollywood megastar Bing Crosby was part-owner of the Pirates, Kiner was often closely linked with celebrities such as Crosby&#x27;s colleague Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra, but even more to publicized romances, dates, or photos with leading ladies, such as Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, and Janet Leigh. He was Taylor&#x27;s date to the premiere of &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; in 1949 and began dating Leigh when &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; was being filmed at Forbes Field.

Kiner was married four times; his first spouse was 1950s tennis star Nancy Chaffee from 1951 to 1968. They had three children together: Michael, Scott, and Kathryn.

Kiner was also married to Barbara (née George) Kiner from 1969 to 1980, and to DiAnn Kiner from 1982 until her death in 2004.

In his 80s, Kiner married, then divorced, Ann Benisch.

He is the second cousin twice removed of MLB infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa.

==Death==
Ralph Kiner died from natural causes in Rancho Mirage, California, on February 6, 2014, at the age of 91. Upon his death, New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon said, &quot;Ralph Kiner was one of the most beloved people in Mets history - an original Met and extraordinary gentleman.&quot; At the time of his death, Kiner had been battling Bell&#x27;s palsy, and the effects of a stroke that he had suffered a decade prior that forced him to reduce his broadcast schedule to a handful of games a season.

On February 21, 2014, an online Twitter petition was started to rename Citi Field Sections 132–134 as &#x27;Kiner&#x27;s Korner&#x27;, to commemorate the 52-year Mets career of Ralph Kiner. As of March 29, 2014, the petition had over 5,000 followers.

==Legacy==
Kiner was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975. Kiner had garnered 273 votes by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, one more than the minimum required for election. It was in his final year of eligibility (his 13th, as no vote was held in 1963 and 1965), and it was the closest call possible for any player elected by the BBWAA (any further votes would be before the Veterans Committee if he was not elected). Kiner was also the only player voted in that year. He attended every Hall of Fame ceremony from the time he was inducted until his death.

Kiner was elected to the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1984.

The Pittsburgh Pirates retired his uniform number 4 on September 19, 1987. He was inducted into the Pirates Hall of Fame in 2022 as part of the inaugural class.

In 1999, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; placed Kiner at number 90 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players&quot;. That same year, he was one of the 100 finalists for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team that year.

The Mets honored him with an on-field ceremony on &quot;Ralph Kiner Night&quot; at Shea Stadium on Saturday, July 14, 2007. On that night, fans were given photos of Kiner. Franchise icon Tom Seaver gave a commemorative speech recalling Kiner&#x27;s legacy. Other guests of note were Yogi Berra, Bob Feller, and broadcaster Ernie Harwell. To honor his tenure, the Mets announced that the home broadcast booth at future home Citi Field would be named for Kiner (the booth at Shea had previously been named for him in 2002). As a present from the Mets, Kiner received a cruise of his choice.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Kiner as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

In 2014, the Mets &quot;retired&quot; Kiner&#x27;s broadcast microphone and added a logo featuring his name, dates and a vintage broadcast microphone to the left-field wall at Citi Field. They also wore patches with the logo for the season. The logo was later moved from the wall to the stadium&#x27;s top tier alongside the franchise&#x27;s other non-player honorees.

<text>Grachan Moncur II (sometimes credited as Grachan Moncur, born September 2, 1915 – November 3, 1996) was an American jazz bassist with the Savoy Sultans.

== Early life ==
Moncur was a multi-instrumentalist as a teenager, learning trombone, tuba, and double bass while growing up in Miami.

== Career ==
After moving to Newark, New Jersey, Moncur began playing bass on a local radio station, where John Hammond heard him. Hammond brought Moncur in for studio sessions in 1935–36 with Mildred Bailey, Bunny Berigan, Putney Dandridge, Bud Freeman, and Teddy Wilson. He was a founding member of the Savoy Sultans, playing with the group until 1945. Later in the 1940s, he worked with Ike Quebec and Ace Harris. His discography roster also showed he played sessions with baritone and bass saxophones in various 1930s and 1940s recordings.

Moncur returned to Miami in the 1950s, where he remained active until late in the 1960s.

== Personal life ==
Moncur was the half-brother of Al Cooper and the father of jazz trombonist Grachan Moncur III.

<doc id="632720" wikidata="Q1963954" url="?curid=632720" title="Forbes Field">
<text>Forbes Field was a baseball park in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from 1909 to June 28, 1970. It was the third home of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the city&#x27;s Major League Baseball (MLB) team, and the first home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the city&#x27;s National Football League (NFL) franchise. From 1909 to 1924, the stadium also served as the home football field for the University of Pittsburgh &quot;Pitt&quot; Panthers. The stadium sat on Forbes Avenue, named for British general John Forbes, who fought in the French and Indian War and named the city in 1758.

The US$1 million ($ million today) project was launched by Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; owner Barney Dreyfuss to replace his franchise&#x27;s second home, Exposition Park. The stadium was made of concrete and steel, the first such stadium in the National League and third in Major League Baseball, in a bid to be more durable than wooden ballparks. The Pirates opened Forbes Field on June 30, 1909, against the Chicago Cubs, and played the final game against the Cubs on June 28, 1970. The field itself featured a large playing surface, with the batting cage placed in the deepest part of center field during games. Seating was altered multiple times throughout the stadium&#x27;s life; at times fans were permitted to sit on the grass in the outfield during overflow crowds. The Pirates won three World Series while at Forbes Field; the Pittsburgh Panthers football team had five undefeated seasons before moving in 1924. In 1958, broadcaster Bob Prince dubbed Forbes Field &quot;The House of Thrills&quot; for the then-resurgent Pirates and several games that saw late-inning heroics.

Some remnants of the ballpark still stand, surrounded by the campus of the University of Pittsburgh. Fans gather on the site annually on the anniversary of Bill Mazeroski&#x27;s World Series winning home run, in what author Jim O&#x27;Brien writes is &quot;one of the most unique expressions of a love of the game to be found in a major league city&quot;.

==History==

===Planning and design===
In 1903, Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; owner Barney Dreyfuss began to look for ground to build a larger capacity replacement for the team&#x27;s then-current home, Exposition Park. Dreyfuss purchased seven acres of land near the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, adjacent to Schenley Park, with assistance from his friend, industrialist Andrew Carnegie. The low-priced land was selected so Dreyfuss could spend more on the stadium itself. Dreyfuss signed a contract to &quot;make the ballpark ... of a design that would harmonize with the other structures in the Schenley Park district.&quot; The site was initially labeled &quot;Dreyfuss&#x27;s Folly&quot; due to its long distance—a 10-minute trolley ride—from downtown Pittsburgh, but the land around the park developed and criticisms were dropped. Official Pirates&#x27; records show that Forbes Field cost US$1 million for site acquisition and construction. However, some estimates place the cost at twice that amount.

Dreyfuss announced that unlike established wooden ballparks such as the Polo Grounds, he would build a three-tiered stadium out of steel and concrete to increase longevity—the first of its kind in the nation. Charles Wellford Leavitt Jr. was contracted to design the stadium&#x27;s grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897. He had gained experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss&#x27; architectural requirements, Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he designed. Pirates&#x27; manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium&#x27;s design, giving groundskeepers advice on the field, in addition to designing and patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield in case of rain.

Initial work on the land began on January 1, 1909, but ground was not officially broken until March 1. Nicola Building Company built the stadium in 122 days and play began less than four months after ground was broken, on June 30. Though the scoreboard was operated by hand, the ballpark featured multiple innovations such as ramps and elevators to assist fan movement throughout the park, a room for the umpires, and a visiting team clubhouse similar to the Pirates&#x27;. The facade of the stadium featured &quot;buff-colored terra cotta&quot; spelling out &quot;PAC&quot; for the Pittsburgh Athletic Company. The light green steelwork contrasted with the red slate of the roof. Some members of the press urged Dreyfuss to name the stadium after himself. Instead, he decided to honor General John Forbes, who captured Fort Duquesne from the French in 1758 and rebuilt a new &quot;Fort Pitt&quot; at the site.

After Dreyfuss died in 1935, there was renewed media interest in renaming the stadium &quot;Dreyfuss Field&quot;. His widow, Florence, resisted. However, a monument to Dreyfuss was placed in center field just in front of the wall.

===Opening===
The first game was played at Forbes Field on June 30, 1909, one day after the Pittsburgh Pirates had defeated the Chicago Cubs, 8–1, at Exposition Park. Fans began to arrive at the stadium six and one-half hours early for the 3:30 p.m. game. Weather conditions were reported as clear skies with a temperature around 80 degrees. Flags flew at half staff to honor the recently deceased presidents of the Philadelphia Phillies and the Boston Doves. Various National League officials and owners attended the pre-game ceremonies, including league president Harry Pulliam, Civil War veteran and manager of Pittsburgh&#x27;s first professional baseball team Al Pratt, and American League president Ban Johnson. Pittsburgh Mayor William A. Magee threw out the stadium&#x27;s ceremonial first pitch, tossing it from the second tier to John M. Morin, Director of Public Safety, on the field below. Morin then went to the mound and threw the first pitch to the Pirate catcher.

The &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; wrote, &quot;the ceremonies were witnessed by the largest throng that ever attended an event of this kind in this or any other city in the country...Forbes Field is so immense—so far beyond anything else in America in the way of a baseball park—that old experts, accustomed to judging crowds at a glance, were at a loss for reasonable figures.&quot; Records, however, show that the first game was attended by a standing-room only crowd of 30,338.

The first batter at Forbes Field was future Hall of Famer Johnny Evers, the Cubs second baseman and leadoff batter. He was hit by a pitch and later in the inning scored the first run. The first hit by a Pirate was by catcher George Gibson, who eventually became a Pirate manager. The Chicago Cubs won the first game, 3–2. Dreyfuss declared, &quot;This is indeed the happiest day of my life.&quot;

=== Playing field evolution ===

The stadium was widely considered the best in the league.

Dreyfuss &quot;hated cheap home runs and vowed he&#x27;d have none in his park&quot;, which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field. The original distances to the outfield fences in left, center, and right field were , and , respectively.

The left field foul pole initially intersected the bleacher section about two-thirds of the way toward where the bleacher corner touched the fence, at a distance of ,[Pittsburgh &quot;Daily Post&quot;, June 27, 1909, p. 30], leaving a narrow slice which could benefit a strict pull hitter, but which soon proved bothersome to left fielders.

In the early spring of 1912, the diamond was shifted so that the left field foul line intersected the end of the left field fence rather than the bleacher section.[Pittsburgh &quot;Press&quot;, March 3, 1912, p. 20] By 1914, the left field distance was stated as ,[Pittsburgh &quot;Press&quot;, August 25, 1914, p. 20] which eventually became the distance marked on the fence.

In 1921, the seating capacity was increased by the addition of several rows of new box seats.[Pittsburgh &quot;Press&quot;, February 13, 1921, pp. 15][Pittsburgh &quot;Daily Post&quot;, February 13, 1921, p. 18]

In 1925, seating capacity received a bigger bump when the right field grandstand was extended into the corner and into fair territory, replacing a section of wooden bleachers. Construction of the new stands began in late winter and opened in June 1925.

The change reduced the foul line distance from to but increasing the near-right center distance to . Dreyfuss made no secret of his mixed feelings regarding this move, and in May 1930, in response to American League President E. S. Barnard&#x27;s proposed plan to stem the recent flood of sub-350-foot home runs, Dreyfuss readily complied by erecting a high screen.

Even at this long distance from home plate, the fence stood in height in left and center fields, with the new right field wall reduced to following the 1925 construction (later topped by the screen). The backstop was set at behind home plate, larger than the average of in most stadiums of the time. Additional seating eventually cut down the plate-to-screen distance to a still larger-than-average .

With such a large outfield space, triples and inside-the-park home runs were common. The Pirates hit a record eight triples in a single game, on May 30, 1925. Conversely, the stadium was one of the most difficult to hit over-the-fence home runs. The closeness of the right field line from 1925 onward was the only area that compromised Dreyfuss&#x27; original design concept. Even at that, the right field wall angled sharply out to , a typical distance for a major league power alley. Babe Ruth hit the final three home runs of his career in Forbes Field on May 25, 1935; the third of these cleared the right field roof and was considered the longest home run in the park&#x27;s history.

The last major change to the outfield came in 1946, when the fence in left and center was replaced by a brick wall.[Pittsburgh &quot;Press&quot;, December 2, 1945, p. 36] The fence had been painted green, while the bricks were of a reddish color. Ivy was planted at the base of the new wall, restoring the green background enjoyed by batters.[Pittsburgh &quot;Sun-Telegraph&quot;, April 21, 1946, p. 21]

Although Forbes Field developed a reputation as a &quot;pitcher-friendly&quot; ballpark, there was never a no-hitter thrown in the more than 4,700 games at the stadium.

The field itself consisted of natural grass grown in Crestline, Ohio.
Until 1942, Forbes Field&#x27;s batting cage, when not in use, was stored on the field, in front of the stands directly behind home plate, a bare-bones but viable solution rendered obsolete by the introduction that season of a new, considerably larger cage. During that season and part of 1943, the new cage resided in foul territory, down the right field line, near the Pirates&#x27; bullpen. At some point prior to July 26, 1943, evidently prompted by numerous instances of the relocated cage continuing to impact balls in play, the Pirates finally settled on what would become its permanent and, by far, best-remembered home: in fair territory, just to the left of the marker in deepest left-center. The open part of the cage faced the wall, its rear effectively serving as a convex fence, somewhat akin to that surrounding the base of the light tower standing just to the left (as well as those surrounding the left field and right-center field towers). Unlike the batting cage and the flagpole just to its right, the light towers themselves—as opposed to the aforementioned fences—were not in play; a batted ball striking any one of them, or landing inside the surrounding fence, was a home run.

In 1947, well after Dreyfuss&#x27; death, and upon the arrival of veteran slugger Hank Greenberg, the bullpens were moved from foul territory to the base of the scoreboard in left field and were fenced in, cutting from the left field area, from to down the line and to in left-center field. These were not abnormal major league outfield distances, but the obvious attempt to take advantage of Greenberg&#x27;s bat led the media to dub the area &quot;Greenberg Gardens&quot;. Greenberg retired after the season, but by then Ralph Kiner was an established slugger with the Pirates, and the bullpen was redubbed &quot;Kiner&#x27;s Korner&quot;. Kiner was traded after the 1953 season, and the field was restored to its previous configuration in time for the 1954 season.

The final posted dimensions of the ballpark were left field line , left-center field , deepest left-center , deep right-center , right-center field , and right field line . The only marker in exact straightaway center field was the Barney Dreyfuss monument, which sat on the playing field just in front of the wall. Some sources stated as the distance to straightaway center. Some sources also stated as a right-center distance, to the unmarked point where the center field wall intersected the end of the double-deck stands.

Forbes Field&#x27;s outfield fences / walls featured no advertising, except a United States Marine Corps billboard during the 1943 season.

The infield developed a &quot;rock-hard&quot; surface throughout the stadium&#x27;s history. During the final game of the 1960 World Series, Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek was struck in the throat with a ball that bounced at an unexpected angle off the hard dirt surface, breaking up a potentially rally-killing double play and causing Kubek to exit the game. Pittsburgh went on to win the game and the championship. Groundskeepers burned gasoline on the mound to dry it off.

===Seating and tickets===

Forbes Field had an original capacity of 25,000, the largest in the league at the time. Seating at the stadium was remodeled numerous times, peaking at a capacity of 41,000 in 1925 and closing in 1970 at 35,000 seats. On opening day, ticket prices ranged from $1.25 (equal to $ today) for box seats and $1 (equal to $ today) for reserved grand stand sections; temporary bleachers were set up for the occasion and cost $0.50. Ticket prices were considered high for the day and steel pillars supporting the roof occasionally blocked fans&#x27; views of the field. Two thousand bleacher seats were situated along the left field side; tickets were sold for a maximum of $1. When winning streaks attracted high attendance to games, fans were permitted to sit on the grass in right field, provided they agreed to allow a player to catch any ball hit in the area. The lowest season of attendance came in 1914, when 139,620 people attended games; the highest at the stadium came in 1960, when 1,705,828 people watched the Pirates play. On September 23, 1956, the stadium&#x27;s largest crowd, 44,932, gathered to see the home team play the Brooklyn Dodgers. The game was cut short in the top of the ninth inning, after a rain delay forced it past the Pennsylvania Sunday curfew. The Dodgers won the game 8–2 the following day. At 200 people, June 10, 1938, was believed to have marked the smallest crowd to ever attend a Pirates game (against the Philadelphia Phillies), however, Baseball Reference has the attendance for that game listed as 1,034. On September 30, 1962, a crowd of 40,916 people saw the Steelers defeated by the New York Giants, at the Steelers&#x27; highest-attended game at the stadium.

===Closing and demolition===

Though Forbes Field was praised upon its opening, it began to show its age after 60 years of use. The park was the second oldest baseball field in the league at the time – only Shibe Park in Philadelphia was older (it was replaced in 1971 by Veterans Stadium). The location of the park, which initially was criticized for not being developed, grew into a &quot;bustling business district&quot; which led to a lack of parking space. One sportswriter wrote that &quot;The House of Thrills&quot; had become &quot;as joyless as a prison exercise yard&quot;. Following a plan to expand their adjacent campus, the University of Pittsburgh purchased Forbes Field in 1958, with an agreement to lease the stadium to the Pirates until a replacement could be built. A proposal for a new sports stadium in Pittsburgh was first made in 1948, but plans did not attract much attention until the late 1950s. Construction began on Three Rivers Stadium on April 25, 1968. The Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Cubs played a double-header on June 28, 1970. Pittsburgh won the first game 3–2. In the later game Al Oliver hit the last home run in the park, and Matty Alou drove in two runs as the Pirates closed the 62-year-old stadium with a 4–1 victory. The 40,918 spectators in attendance stood and cheered as Dave Giusti retired Willie Smith for the final out (recorded by Bill Mazeroski) at the stadium. Pirates Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente played 15 seasons at Forbes Field. He was emotional during the last game saying, &quot;I spent half my life there.&quot; After the game, home plate was dug up and taken by helicopter to Three Rivers Stadium to be installed in the artificial turf.

A community group attempted to rescue the structure from demolition, proposing such things as a stage, apartments and a farmers market for the site and comparing it to the Eiffel Tower in significance.

The abandoned structure suffered two separate fires that damaged the park, on December 24, 1970, and July 17, 1971. Eleven days after the second fire, demolition began, and the site was cleared for use by the University of Pittsburgh.

===Memorials===
In 1955, a statue of Honus Wagner was dedicated in Schenley Plaza adjacent to Forbes Field. Several thousand fans attended the dedication as well as Wagner himself. His failing health caused him to never leave his open convertible in which he arrived (Wagner died near the end of that year). The statue was moved to Three Rivers Stadium in 1970. Today, the statue stands at the home plate entrance of PNC Park.


The portion of the left field wall over which Bill Mazeroski hit his walk-off home run to end the 1960 World Series, between the scoreboard and the &quot;406 FT&quot; sign, no longer stands at its original location. A portion of that wall, including the distance marker, had been sliced off and moved to the Allegheny Club at Three Rivers Stadium. Before the Three Rivers demolition, the section of the wall was salvaged, and in 2009 it was restored and placed on the Riverwalk outside of PNC Park.
Meanwhile, the original location of that wall is outlined by bricks extending from the left-center field wall across Roberto Clemente Drive and into the sidewalk. A plaque embedded in the sidewalk marks the spot where Mazeroski&#x27;s home run cleared the wall. The left-center and center field brick wall with &quot;457 FT&quot; and &quot;436 FT&quot; painted on it still stands at its original location, along with the stadium&#x27;s flagpole, adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Mervis and Posvar Halls. Despite not technically being the correct section of wall where Mazeroski&#x27;s famous home run cleared, it is often locally referred to as &quot;Mazeroski&#x27;s Wall.&quot; This portion of the wall remained after Forbes Field was torn down, and was refurbished in 2006 in time for the All-Star Game hosted in Pittsburgh. In addition, a wooden replica of an entrance to the stadium, including a ticket window and players entrance, was constructed and placed near the remaining wall in 2006. The home plate used in the stadium&#x27;s final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Posvar Hall. However, its location has been altered; author John McCollister wrote, &quot;Had architects placed home plate in its precise spot about half of the Pirates fans could not view it. The reason: it would have to be on display in the fifth stall of the ladies&#x27; restroom.&quot; However, the original location of the home plate has been more recently determined by others to be approximately away from its current display, just inside the GSPIA/Economics Library, and not in a restroom as has been popularly believed.

A ceremony is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland to listen to a taped broadcast of the final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone at the base of the flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game&#x27;s 40th anniversary—over 600 people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.

In 1909, Forbes Field&#x27;s opening season, the Pirates beat the Detroit Tigers in the World Series. It was the only meeting of eventual Hall of Famers Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb.

On October 2, 1920, Forbes Field hosted the last triple-header in MLB history.

On August 5, 1921, Forbes Field was the site of the first live radio broadcast of a Major League Baseball game in the United States. Harold Arlin announced the play-by-play action between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies over KDKA from a box seat next to the first-base dugout. Regular broadcasts of Pirates games began over KDKA in 1936, announced by A. K. &quot;Rosey&quot; Rowswell, a local humorist and friend of team owner Bill Benswanger. Rowswell is quoted as describing his broadcasting with, &quot;It&#x27;s not just play-by-play that matters. It&#x27;s what you say in between the pitches that counts.&quot; His style influenced junior partner Bob Prince, who began broadcasting in 1948. Rowswell broadcast games at Forbes Field until his death in 1955.

In 1925, the Pirates became the first team to come back from a three-game to one deficit to defeat the Washington Senators and win the World Series. Pittsburgh&#x27;s third and final World Series championship while they played at Forbes Field came in 1960. Bill Mazeroski hit the first home run to end a World Series, the only walk-off home run in World Series Game 7 history. These two World Series victories mark the only times that the Pirates clinched a championship at home, with Forbes Field hosting both.

Two unassisted triple plays were turned at Forbes Field. The first took place on May 7, 1925, when Pittsburgh&#x27;s Glenn Wright achieved the feat. Two seasons later, in 1927, Jimmy Cooney—who had been a victim of the first triple play—also acquired three outs by himself.
On May 25, 1935, at Forbes Field, Babe Ruth hit the last three home runs of his career as his Boston Braves lost to the Pirates, 11–7. His last home run cleared the right field stands roofline, making him the first player to ever do so.

On October 8, 1946, six months before his major league debut, Jackie Robinson played with his African American all-stars against Honus Wagner&#x27;s all-stars.

Most of the game-action scenes from the 1951 film &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; were filmed at the stadium.

On May 28, 1956, Dale Long of the Pirates took what one author has stated was the first-ever curtain call in baseball history, after hitting home runs in eight consecutive games caused fans to cheer for five minutes.

The Homestead Grays of the Negro leagues played all home games at Forbes Field from 1922 to 1939. Grays owner Cumberland Posey became friends with Dreyfuss, who rarely missed a Grays game. In 1930, Josh Gibson made his premiere for the Grays at Forbes Field. Also in 1930, the Grays and the Kansas City Monarchs played the first baseball game at night in Pittsburgh on July 18, 1930. A crowd of over 15,000 was expected. Floodlights were installed the day before the game after they were transported from Cleveland, where the Grays and Monarchs had played on July 16. Six members of the Grays&#x27; 1936 team have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Beginning in 1937, the Grays won nine consecutive Negro National League championships.

The University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s baseball team also often used Forbes Field for home games.

===Football===
The University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s football team moved from Exposition Park into Forbes Field upon its opening in 1909 and played there until 1924 when it moved into the larger Pitt Stadium only a few blocks away. In their first game at Forbes Field on October 16, 1909, the Panthers defeated Bucknell University 18–6. In 1910, Pitt&#x27;s second year at Forbes Field, the Panthers went undefeated without allowing a single point. The Panthers had several successful seasons while playing at Forbes Field, including five in which they went undefeated and were awarded national championship titles in 1910, 1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918. During their years at Forbes Field, Pitt&#x27;s teams were led by Hall of Fame coaches Joe Thompson, Glenn &quot;Pop&quot; Warner and Jock Sutherland. Forbes Field was the site of yet another broadcasting first when on October 8, 1921, Harold W. Arlin announced live play-by-play action of the Pitt-West Virginia football game on radio station KDKA, the first live radio broadcast of a college football game in the United States. Duquesne University also played many of their home games there in the 1930s and 1940s.

The 1926 Carnegie Tech Tartans football team pulled off one of the greatest upsets in sports history by defeating the 8–0 Notre Dame Fighting Irish, shutting them out, 19–0. Legendary ND head coach, Knute Rockne, thought the Pittsburgh team would be easily defeated and did not show up for the game.

Pittsburgh native, Art Rooney founded his NFL team under the name the Pittsburgh Pirates, on July 8, 1933, for $2,500 ($ in present-day terms). The franchise&#x27;s first game, against the New York Giants, was held on September 20, 1933, at Forbes Field. The Giants won the game 23–2 in front of 25,000 people. Rooney wrote of the game, &quot;The Giants won. Our team looks terrible. The fans didn&#x27;t get their money&#x27;s worth.&quot; The Pirates rebounded to gain their first ever franchise victory a week later at Forbes Field, against the Chicago Cardinals. The NFL&#x27;s Pirates were renamed the Steelers in 1940, and otherwise struggled during much of their three-decades of tenancy at Forbes. The club achieved its first winning record in 1942; its tenth season of existence. On November 30, 1952, the Steelers met the New York Giants at Forbes Field for a snowy afternoon game. Pittsburgh entered the game with a 3–6 record, but went on to set multiple team records, including scoring nine touchdowns, to win the game 63–7. Excited by their team&#x27;s play, the 15,140 spectators ran onto the field and began to tear the field goal posts out of the ground. The University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s acquisition of Forbes Field in 1958 gave the Steelers some options, and they began transferring some of their home games to the much larger Pitt Stadium that year. The Steelers played their final game at Forbes Field on December 1, 1963. The franchise moved to Pitt Stadium exclusively the following season.
===Boxing and other events===
Boxing bouts were held at Forbes Field from the 1910s to the 1950s, attracting crowds of over 15,000 people. On June 23, 1919, Harry &quot;The Pittsburgh Windmill&quot; Greb—the only boxer to beat Gene Tunney—defeated Mike Gibbons in a ten-round bout at Forbes Field. On July 18, 1951, the heavyweight boxing championship was held at the stadium. In seven rounds, Ezzard Charles was knocked out by Jersey Joe Walcott. Another bout on September 25, 1939, was attended by 17,000 people including Art Rooney and Pie Traynor. Pittsburgh native Billy Conn defended his light heavyweight title against Melio Bettina, whom he had beaten months earlier. Conn won the bout by decision in 15 rounds. Two years later, on June 18, 1941, Conn fought Joe Louis at New York City&#x27;s Polo Grounds, in an attempt to become the world heavyweight champion. The Pirates and the New York Giants, who were playing at Forbes Field, were called into their dugouts while the 24,738 fans in attendance listened to the radio broadcast of the hour-long bout. Conn led the bout into the final round, but fought for the knockout and was knocked out himself.

On Sunday, October 17, 1909, at 3:00 p.m. a communion service was held at Forbes Field as the culmination of the International Centennial Celebration and Conventions of the Disciples of Christ marking the 100th anniversary of the signing of the &quot;Declaration and Address&quot; by Thomas Campbell in September 1809. Campbell was a founding father of the American Restoration Movement (Disciples of Christ, Christian Church, Churches of Christ). Delegates and members of churches from all over the world were present.

The Mine Safety and Health Administration hosted a mine rescue and safety demonstration at Forbes on October 30, 1911. The event included first-aid and rescue demonstrations. Around 15,000 attended the event, including President William H. Taft. Forbes Field also hosted circuses and concerts.

<text>Monaro Highway is a highway in Victoria, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory, in Australia, linking in Victoria to Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) via the Monaro region. From its southern terminus, it follows the nearby Cann River upstream towards the New South Wales border through heavily forested terrain. Within New South Wales (NSW), it makes its way through further forest before reaching the pastures typical of the Monaro. There are multiple towns and villages along the highway, including Bombala, Nimmitabel and Cooma. The terrain within the Monaro is largely hilly, and there are numerous crossings. The road also parallels the former Bombala railway line in several locations. Within the ACT, the road becomes a high volume roadway and serves the southern suburbs of Canberra. The highway has more recently had a grade-separated dual carriageway extension constructed within Canberra, as part of the Eastern Parkway construction project. It is designated part of route M23, and route A23 within Canberra, and route B23 within Victoria and New South Wales, with a concurrency where it also carries route B72 between the two sections of Snowy Mountains Highway.

==Route==
===Victoria===

Monaro Highway begins at the intersection with Princes Highway in in the East Gippsland region. After leaving the town, it heads north along a relatively flat area following the Cann River upstream through a locality known as Noorinbee. To the west is farmland between the road and river and a mountain range beyond and to the east are some smaller hills. The land to the east is largely part of Drummer State Forest. As the sides close in at the northern end of this wider valley area, the highway crosses to the west bank of the river highway and enters the Noorinbee North locality. Continuing north, the terrain is more hilly and forested and the alignment more closely parallels the winding river upstream to the area of Weeragua. At this point, the land to the west of the river is part of Buldah State Forest, and to the east is Coopracambra National Park. The road has now entered the Chandlers Creek locality and at Weeragua, the road crosses the west branch of the Cann River and continues further north along the east branch through a small farmland area. From here, it follows the river through more forest before coming to another small farmland area and crossing Chandlers Creek itself. The road once again enters forest as it follows the Cann River east branch to its upper end at the confluence of Fiddlers Green Creek and Flat Rock Creek, the latter of which the road follows through Coopracambra National Park to the New South Wales border.

===New South Wales===

From the state border, Monaro Highway continues north through forest, generally keeping Bondi State Forest to the west and South East Forest National Park to the east. The immediate landscape by the roadside also includes the occasional small tract of farmland at several points. There is a crossing over the Genoa River within the forest, and the road roughly follows it upstream. Upon exiting the large forested area that exists near the border, the road enters farmland. This farmland continues as a patchwork of pastures for the rest of the journey within New South Wales and is only interrupted by the occasional town. The road continues roughly northwest until it meets Delegate Road at a T-intersection just outside Bombala. Turning towards the northeast at the intersection, the road quickly reaches Bombala. Within the urban area, the road firstly takes on the name Maybe Street. It then turns northeast at Forbes Street and crosses over the Bombala River. After the bridge, the road returns to a northeast heading as Mahratta Street. This street continues for a short distance before a right angle bend to the northwest to match the same manoeuvre by the river. The road then becomes Stephen Street before returning to the Monaro Highway name at the edge of the urban area and concluding its zig-zag trajectory through Bombala.
The highway then travels in a north-easterly direction, crossing the Bombala River again and making its way towards . The road bypasses the village just to its west and makes a further crossing of the Bombala River. Continuing north, the road winds its way towards a ridge near Native Dog Creek. After crossing the creek, the road climbs the ridge and continues northbound. At this point, the former Bombala railway line alignment winds along the western side and is visible in some locations. Eventually the road swings east and meets the western end of the eastern section of the Snowy Mountains Highway at another T-intersection. The highway turns towards the northwest at this intersection and, after a short distance, crosses the Maclaughlin River. A little further along this heading, the road enters . The highway takes on the name Bombala Street within the urban area and swings to the northeast through the small town. From here, the road continues northwest once again with the railway alignment never far to the west and sometimes paralleling the road. The road crosses several small creeks along this stretch of road. Before reaching , the road also passes to the west of Kuma Nature Reserve and crosses over the former Bombala railway line. Within the town of Cooma, the road initially takes up the name Bombala Street. Where this street meets Sharp Street at a 4-way roundabout, the highway turns east, while the western section of Snowy Mountains Highway begins from the same point and heads west. Continuing east as Sharp Street, the road soon curves north and transitions back to Monaro Highway. It then parallels the railway within the urban area and also passes by the Tadeusz Kościuszko Monument as it leaves the town.
North of Cooma, the highway follows the same general path as the railway alignment as far as the area of Bunyan. From there, it continues along the same rough heading and crosses the Numeralla River just prior to its confluence with the Murrumbidgee River. The road then follows the Murrumbidgee downstream at some distance to its east. The highway continues on towards Bredbo and crosses the Bredbo River as it enters the village. The highway takes on the name Cooma Street through Bredbo and crosses over the railway yet again just north of the town. Further to the north, the road passes through Gungoandra Gap to the east of Round Hill. Mount Colinton is now visible to the highway&#x27;s east, and a larger range known as the Clear Range is visible to west. The ridgeline of the Clear Range forms the eastern border of the ACT in this area. Heading further downstream, continuing the distant parallel of the Murrumbidgee, the road enters and crosses the railway a final few times as the railway winds through the area. It does not enter the urban area of Michelago itself and instead passes to the west of the village. North of Michelago the road and railway parallel each other very closely as they head towards the ACT border at the north end of the Clear Range. The road crosses the border just east of Cunningham Hill.

===Australian Capital Territory===

From the territory border, the road passes into the rural southern reaches of the Tuggeranong District. In this area of the ACT, the railway line forms the eastern border of the territory, with the railway line itself situated on the NSW side. To the western side of the road flows Guises Creek, with a range of hills beyond it, Rose Hill and Mount Rob Roy being two of the more prominent peaks. As the road reaches the Tuggeranong urban area, it begins to parallel the urban area instead and forms part of the border of Tuggeranong&#x27;s eastern suburbs. Approaching the Tharwa Drive intersection, the road becomes a dual carriageway. The road climbs onto a small ridge with views of the urban area to the west and the Tuggeranong Pine Plantation to the east. The road then descends towards the Jerrabomberra district border where it meets Isabella Drive, and then passes through the light industrial suburb of , although the land to the west of the road is largely undeveloped. Within Hume, the road meets Lanyon Drive, which heads across the nearby border towards and .

The road then continues roughly north and crosses a largely open area of pasture. The SouthCare emergency helicopter is stationed to the east of the road not far after its intersection with Lanyon Drive, and further on, a prison, the Alexander Maconochie Centre, is located to the west. Approaching the northern end of the pasture, Jerrabomberra Creek flows to the east. At the northern end is the Hindmarsh Drive interchange. The highway passes underneath Hindmarsh Drive and continues over Jerrabomberra Creek, before then passing over an interchange with Canberra Avenue (where it is designated route M23), along with an overpass above the Canberra railway line branch, and an interchange above Newcastle Street. Monaro Highway is then carried across a flood plain above farmland on concrete drainage channels, before crossing the Molonglo River over the Malcolm Fraser Bridge where it becomes Majura Parkway, continuing on until it meets Federal Highway near Goorooyaroo Nature Reserve.

==History==
===Early roads===

A minor road appeared in this region on Thomas Mitchell&#x27;s 1834 map of the Nineteen Counties of New South Wales. Located within Murray county, the road continued from towards the south before turning west crossing the Queanbeyan River near its confluence with the Molonglo River (the current location of ), which then headed south towards what was then known as the &quot;Miccaligo Plains&quot; (now ). The road is then marked as continuing south beyond the border of the county; although no settlement could legally occur beyond the Nineteen Counties at that time, those who settled beyond this area were known as squatters. The detail of the road beyond Murray county is not plotted on the map. By 1844 the road had reached Cooma, and was extended to Bombala by 1852. Mapping from 1882 shows the road had extended all the way to the Victorian border, crossing near .

===Highway===
====Victoria====
Within Victoria, the passing of the &quot;Country Roads Act of 1912&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria provided for the establishment of the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) and their ability to declare Main Roads, taking responsibility for the management, construction and care of the state&#x27;s major roads from local municipalities. Cann Valley Road was declared a Main Road from Cann River to the border with New South Wales on 23 March 1914.

The passing of the &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot; provided for the declaration of State Highways, roads two-thirds financed by the State government through the Country Roads Board. Cann Valley Highway was declared a State Highway on 10 August 1960, from Cann River to the border with New South Wales (for a total of 27.5 miles), subsuming the original declaration of Cann Valley Road as a Main Road.

As part of the Bicentennial Road Development Programme, the roadway was sealed along its entire length, the project being completed in March 1985. It was renamed Monaro Highway on 25 October 1996, to match the highway to which it connects at the NSW border.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared the road as Monaro Highway (Arterial #6760), beginning at Cann River and ending at the New South Wales border in Chandlers Creek.

====New South Wales====

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW), later amended by the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for the additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads.

The roads forming the future highway were given the following classifications on 8 August 1928:
*Main Road No. 53 from the Victorian border via to , amended to Trunk Road 53 in 1929;
*Main Road No. 4 from Nimmitabel to Cooma, amended to State Highway 4 in 1929;
*Main Road No. 52 from Cooma via Royalla and Queanbeyan to the ACT border, amended to Trunk Road 52 in 1929.
State Highway 4 was actually named Monaro Highway at the time, which ran from to .

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the New South Wales MRB in 1932, declared State Highway 19 on 16 March 1938, from Canberra via Royalla and Bredbo to the intersection with State Highway 4 at Cooma, and from the intersection with State Highway 4 at Nimmitabel via Bombala and Delegate to connect with Bonang Highway at the state border with Victoria, subsuming Trunk Road 53; the southern end of Trunk Road 52 was truncated to meet State Highway 19 at Royalla, as a result.

State Highway 4 was renamed Snowy Mountains Highway on 19 July 1955; the section of State Highway 4 between Nimmitabel and Cooma was also re-designated part of State Highway 19 at the same time. State Highway 19 was officially named Monaro Highway three years later, on 18 June 1958. In contrast with Snowy Mountains Highway, the entire length of State Highway 19 was within the Monaro region. During the mid to late 1960s the highway south of Nimmitabel was rerouted along a newly constructed roadway; the former alignment is now known as Old Bombala Road. Snowy Mountains Highway was also realigned in this area as part of these works and connected to Monaro Highway along the new alignment. The alignment of the highway&#x27;s southern end to the state border with Victoria was later changed, travelling via Rockton to connect to Cann River Highway, instead of via Delegate to connect to Bonang Highway, on 12 October 1977; the former alignment was proclaimed Trunk Road 93 and is now known as Delegate Road.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Monaro Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 19, from the state border with Victoria via Bombala, Nimmitabel, Cooma and Michelago to the state border with the Australian Capital Territory.

====Australian Capital Territory====
In 1958 Federal government agreed rename the Cooma-Canberra Road within the ACT as Monaro Highway: this gave the roadway a single name between Canberra and the Victorian border. Originally, the highway ended where it met Jerrabomberra Avenue. Plans were publicised during the mid-1980s for an upgrade of the existing Monaro Highway to dual-carriageway standard between Isabella Drive and Jerrabomberra Avenue, and an extension of the roadway to the north. These works were known as the Eastern Parkway. These plans were then given the go ahead in a report tabled on 5 May 1987, the estimated costs were $50 million including upgrades to other nearby roadways. Around the same time period a large service centre was proposed for near the Isabella Drive intersection, though it was quite controversial, and the developer pulled out. Between 1988 and November 1989 the duplication was completed, and the roadway extended as far as Canberra Avenue. After this the road was extended to its current terminus at Morshead Drive, although the northbound carriageway was originally routed over Dairy Flat Road until a southbound carriageway was constructed later on. Further duplication was performed to other sections of the extension until all sections were completed in mid-2012. The northern end of Monaro Highway now connects to the southern end of Majura Parkway following the latter&#x27;s completion in 2016. Territory and Municipal Services has classified Monaro Highway as an arterial road within the ACT Road Hierarchy.

Currently, upgrades are underway to the highway near Hume, providing new grade separated interchanged at Lanyon Drive and Isabella Drive, as well as left-in, left-out intersections with Mugga Lane, Tralee Street with an overpass between these intersections. The upgrades will complete a 25 km long motorway-standard road all along eastern edge of Canberra.

===Route markers===
Route markers were first introduced in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled out to the various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route numbering scheme. The highway was originally designated National Route 23 in 1962 between Canberra and Cooma, extended further to Nimmitabel in 1967. Although after the construction of the Eastern Parkway extension, the highway north of Canberra Avenue was designated Alternate National Route 23. The section of Monaro Highway between Steeple Flat and Cooma was also designated National Route 18 in addition to National Route 23, in an arrangement known as a &quot;duplex&quot; or &quot;concurrency&quot;, allowing one route to cover Snowy Mountains Highway from end to end (with Monaro Highway linking its two sections).

With all three states&#x27; conversion to their newer alphanumeric systems between the late 1990s to the early 2010s, its former route number was updated to route B23 for the highway within Victoria (in 1997), to route B23 within New South Wales section (in 2013), and route A23 within the Australian Capital Territory (also in 2013). This violates the convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; routes are numbered above 50; the violation was allowed so the number and letter would be consistent across state lines. The concurrency along Monaro Highway remains intact, with B72 used in addition to B23 between Steeple Flat and Cooma, linking the two sections of Snowy Mountains Highway. In the ACT, Monaro Highway is designated route A23 from the NSW border to Canberra Avenue, and as route M23 north of Canberra Avenue to its terminus, where it joins Majura Parkway.

<text>Cooma is a town in the south of New South Wales, Australia. It is located south of the national capital, Canberra, via the Monaro Highway. It is also on the Snowy Mountains Highway, connecting Bega with the Riverina.

At the , Cooma had a population of . Cooma is the main town of the Monaro region. It is above sea level. The name could have derived from an Aboriginal word &quot;Coombah&quot;, meaning &#x27;big lake&#x27; or &#x27;open country&#x27;.

Cooma is south of the banks of the Murrumbidgee River, a main tributary of the Murray–Darling basin. Cooma sources its water from the river.

==History==
The area now known as Cooma lies on the traditional lands of the Ngarigo people.

Cooma was explored by Captain J. M. Currie in 1823. It was first surveyed in 1840, and was gazetted in 1849. Cooma was proclaimed a municipality in 1879.

The railway from Sydney was extended from Royalla to Cooma in 1889 under the supervision of John Whitton. The line was closed to rail passenger traffic in 1989. The estimated population of Cooma was 47 in 1851 and it grew to 2330 (1911), 1969 (1933), 2249 (1947), 9103 (1966), 7353 (1976) and 7978 (1981).

In 1949, the town became the headquarters of the Snowy Mountains Scheme and grew rapidly. Between 1949 and 1974 the population expanded due to an influx of 65,000 workers from more than 30 countries. Those working on the Snowy Scheme depended on the railway and during construction of the scheme, the railways were one of the largest employers in the region. In 1959, the tenth anniversary of the scheme was celebrated with the erection of an avenue of flags representing the 27 nationalities of people working on the scheme.

Cooma has developed a growing tourism industry as it became the main rest stop for many travellers heading to the NSW snow fields during the winter months. As a result, the town nicknamed itself the &#x27;Gateway to the Snowy Mountains&#x27;.

The Aviation Pioneers&#x27; Memorial at Cooma contains artifacts recovered from the Avro 618 Ten aircraft Southern Cloud, which crashed on 21 March 1931 in the Toolong range of the Australian Alps. The wreck was not found until 26 October 1958.

==Climate==
Cooma has a dry oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Summer averages are warm, though tend to swing wildly between hot and cool; and winters are chilly with particularly cold night time temperatures due to its valley location, high elevation, and frequent clear skies, sometimes recording the lowest temperatures in the country. However, daytime maximum temperatures in winter are often unremarkable, on account of the foehn effect.

The area is exceptionally dry by southeast coastal Australian standards as it lies in a major rain shadow; the region is flanked by mountain ranges on all sides, most notably on the west. Despite its dryness, it has only 90.1 clear days annually, lower than the adjacent coastal areas of Wollongong and Sydney (106 and 107 clear days respectively). Strong cold fronts often push through the region in winter and snow is not uncommon in Cooma from June to September, though is generally light and rarely settles for more than 24 hours. Frost occurs in all months of the year and is frequent between April and October. Severe thunderstorms are semi-frequent in summer, and owing to the elevation of the town can carry large quantities of hail.

Mean daily minimum temperatures range from (July) to (January), with an annual mean daily minimum of . Mean daily maximum temperatures range from (July) to (January), with an annual mean daily maximum of .

The airport is located at a higher elevation than the town, causing maximum temperatures to be notably cooler but minima somewhat milder.

<text>Philippe Néricault Destouches (9 April 1680 – 4 July 1754) was a French playwright who wrote 22 plays.

==Biography==
Destouches was born at Tours, in today&#x27;s department of Indre-et-Loire.

When he was nineteen years of age, he became secretary to M. de Puysieux, the French ambassador to Switzerland. In 1716 he was attached to the French embassy in London, where he remained for six years under abbé Dubois.

He later contracted a marriage with Dorothea Johnston, Lancashire lady; however, the marriage was not avowed for some years. In 1727 he portrayed his domestic circumstances in &quot;Le Philosophe Marié&quot; (The Married Philosopher).

Upon returning to France in 1723, he was elected to the Académie française. In 1727 he acquired considerable estates, the possession of which conferred the privileges of nobility.

He spent his later years at Fortoiseau, his chateau near Melun, and died July 4, 1754.

Destouches wished to revive the comedy of character as understood by Molière, but he thought it desirable that the moral should be directly expressed.

His early comedies were:

*&quot;Le Curieux Impertinent&quot; (1710)
*&quot;L&#x27;Ingrat&quot; (1712)
*&quot;L&#x27;Irrésolu&quot; (1713)
*&quot;Le Médisant&quot; (1715)
*&quot;La Fausse Veuve&quot; (1715)
*&quot;Le Triple Mariage&quot; (1716)
*&quot;L&#x27;Obstacle Imprévu&quot; (1717)

The most highly regarded of these is &quot;L&#x27;Irrésolu&quot; (The Irresolute Man), in which Dorante, after vacillating throughout the play between Julie and Climène, marries Julie, but concludes the play with the reflection, &quot;J&#x27;aurais mieux fait, je crois, d&#x27;épouser Climène&quot; (&quot;I would have done better, I think, to marry Climène&quot;).

After eleven years of diplomatic service, Destouches returned to the stage in 1727 with &quot;Le Philosophe Marié&quot;, followed in 1730 by &quot;Les Philosophes Amoureux&quot; and in 1732 by &quot;Le Glorieux&quot;, a picture of the struggle then beginning between the old nobility and the wealthy parvenus who found opportunity in the poverty of France.

He then wrote:
*&quot;La Pupille&quot; (1734)
*&quot;L&#x27;Ambitieux et l&#x27;Indiscrète&quot; (1737)
*&quot;Les Dehor Trompeurs&quot; (1740)
*&quot;La Belle Orgueilleuse&quot; (1741)
*&quot;L&#x27;Amour Use&quot; (1741)
*&quot;Les Amours de Ragonde&quot; (1742)

His later comedies were:
*&quot;La Force du Naturel&quot; (1750)
*&quot;Le Jeune Homme á l&#x27;Épreuve&quot; (1751)
*&quot;Le Dissipateur&quot; (1753)

His last three plays were produced posthumously. They were:

*&quot;La Fausse Agnès&quot; (1759)
*&quot;Le Tambour Nocturne&quot; (1762)
*&quot;L&#x27;Homme Singulier&quot; (1764, his last play)

==Memorable phrase==
Destouches&#x27;s 1717 dramatic comedy &quot;L&#x27;Obstacle Imprévu&quot; (Act I, sc. vi) was the origin of the oft-quoted maxim, “The absent are always in the wrong.” Bergen Evans, in his &quot;Dictionary of Quotations&quot;, said:
“Though Néricault ... is credited with the first statement of this thought in this form, the idea is old and, in other forms, universal.”
In &quot;le Glorieux&quot; he wrote &quot;To critic is easy, only the art is difficult&quot;.

<text>Richmond is a town in Tasmania about 25 km north-east of Hobart, in the Coal River region, between the Midland Highway and Tasman Highway. At the , Richmond had a population of 880.

Richmond&#x27;s most famous landmark is the Richmond Bridge, built in 1823 to 1825, around the time of the town&#x27;s first settlement. It is Australia&#x27;s oldest bridge still in use.

St John&#x27;s Catholic church was built in 1836, and is considered the oldest Roman Catholic church in Australia.

St Luke&#x27;s was built in 1834–1836 and is the oldest Anglican Church in Australia. The clock mounted in the church tower chimes the hour is manually wound by a group of volunteers. The clock was previously from St David&#x27;s Church in Hobart, which was demolished to build St David&#x27;s Cathedral. St Luke&#x27;s cemetery is located on Wellington Street, just before Paramore Street.

The town was initially part of the route between Hobart and Port Arthur until the Sorell Causeway was constructed in 1872.

Present-day Richmond is best known as being preserved as it was at that time. It is a vibrant tourist town, with many of the sandstone structures still standing. Many of these structures are built in the Georgian style.

== History ==
Richmond was initially established as a pioneering district within the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land penal colony. Richmond later developed as a police district for the surrounding region after Governor George Arthur appointed a number of paid magistrates to oversee penal discipline in 1827. Arthur implemented this measure as a way of increasing penal order, punishing crime and keeping an accurate record of the movements and behaviour of all convicts in attempt to hold the colony up as an orderly colony, enforcing strict convict discipline. Consequently, Richmond grew as a centre of local government with a centralised justice system, holding council and court hearings from the Coal River Valley to Campania and Colebrook. According to historian Peter Macfie, there was a high degree of prejudice among the senior public figures of Richmond toward the convicts, which resulted in a &#x27;caste system&#x27; within the community – something that was maintained in the region through most of the nineteenth century. Immigrant settlers mostly occupied the estates within the township, whereas emancipists eventually settled on farms on the fringes of the township.

The Grass Tree Hill Road and Governor Arthur&#x27;s Road leading into Richmond was built from 1833 to 1838 by groups of convicts known as ‘Chain Gangs’. These prisoners were sentenced to day labouring near the town and were employed in construction within the localised area. They frequently experienced shortages of food and clothing, which lead many of the men to steal from each other as well as from neighbouring houses. Prisoners also lay kangaroo traps as a means of supplementing rations. Anyone that was found to be stealing or was caught laying traps was severely punished. In 1834 and 1835, there were a number of resistance efforts in response to the shortages. Some men refused to attend church, refused to labour and there was even a rebellion led by five prisoners who wielded their picks against authorities. Many of the Georgian style buildings which are present in the township today were constructed by these convict gangs, including the Bridge, the Court House and the Gaol.

The name given to the region was the Coal River district. Lieutenant-Governor William Sorell was the first to take steps to form a town and later he took up land there himself. The Land Commissioners surveyed land for a township in the mid 1820s.

James Backhouse reported Richmond had a court house, a gaol, a windmill and about thirty houses by 1832. Backhouse visited the town again in February 1834 and reported Richmond had nearly doubled in size. The court house was built in 1825-26 and the northern part of the gaol in 1825. Richmond Post Office opened on 1 June 1832. Richmond bridge was built in 1823, using convict labour, and is known as the largest stone span bridge in Australia.

The foundation stone for St Luke&#x27;s was laid on 3 February 1834 by Governor Arthur and it is considered one of the finest churches designed by John Lee Archer.

Low-grade coal was found, on the bank of the Coal River downstream, from the later site of Richmond, by the colonial surveyor, James Meehan, in November 1803. It was mined there, as early as 1805. A short-lived underground coal mine, the Lowland Coal Mine, was developed on the &#x27;Lowlands&#x27; property, in 1840, but it had ailed in 1842.

==Tourist attractions==
Some notable tourist attractions in Richmond are the Richmond Bridge, the Richmond Gaol, Richmond Court House, Zoodoo Wildlife Park, a model of Old Hobart Town in the 1800s, and numerous old and heritage-listed buildings and parks.

<doc id="632750" wikidata="Q5132413" url="?curid=632750" title="Click (TV programme)">
<text>Click (formerly Click Online) is a BBC television programme covering technology news and developments in the world of technology and the Internet, presented by Spencer Kelly and Lara Lewington. It was created by then-BBC presenter Stephen Cole.

Since its debut on 6 April 2000, it has broadcast a new episode every week, marking its 1,000th episode on 6 July 2019.
In October 2024, the channel announced it was to axe the programme after 25 years, alongside its interview show &quot;HARDtalk&quot;. However although no announcement is found to reference, that decision itself may have been cancelled. Both shows continue to be scheduled and aired, their home pages updated - BBC News Click, and BBC News HARDtalk - and can be viewed again on BBC iPlayer.

== Format ==
Each episode is introduced by the hosts, Spencer Kelly and Lara Lewington, and features reports about technology developments all over the world by a group of BBC contributors. Reports cover a variety of &#x27;tech&#x27; subjects, including consumer technologies and issues, social impact of emerging technologies, video games, and innovations in mobile technology.

The show currently features a &quot;Week in Tech&quot; segment, compiling the week&#x27;s biggest news in the technology area.

The programme previously included &quot;Webscape&quot;, a closing segment hosted by Kate Russell recommending new and useful websites. This segment was dropped but Russell continued doing general reporting for the show.

There are different editions of the programme, two 30-minute programmes (shown on UK feed of BBC News channel), a global edition (international feed of BBC News channel), and a 15-minute version (BBC One and UK feed of BBC News channel during &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;). A four-minute version also appears on BBC World News at varying times of the week.

BBC World Service used to broadcast a weekly sister radio show, &quot;Digital Planet&quot;, which, for a time, shared the same name. This ended in March 2023. It was presented by Gareth Mitchell and contributors Bill Thompson, Ghislaine Boddington and Angelica Mari.

=== Local versions ===
Persian-speakers can also watch &quot;BBC Persian Click&quot; online and on BBC Persian TV presented by Nima Akbarpour. Further local versions are due to launch from Autumn 2018, including Click Tamil in October 2018, with the aim of having the show broadcast in up to 20 languages.

== History ==
The show started as &quot;Click Online&quot; in April 2000, hosted by Stephen Cole, and featured reports focused on the rise of the Internet and related technologies. Thursday, 29 December 2005 marked the last edition of &quot;Click Online&quot;, as the show was previously known, coinciding with the departure of Stephen Cole after 295 shows. The programme was thereafter renamed &quot;Click&quot;, with new music and titles, and with Spencer Kelly, an existing reporter and producer on the show who also compiled reports for &quot;The Gadget Show&quot; on Channel 5, as the new host. Since then it has expanded its &quot;online&quot; focus, now featuring reports on technology developments from all over the world. Since April 2020, existing reporter Lara Lewington has become co-host.

Episode 774 was the world&#x27;s first programme to be shot and edited entirely on mobile devices.

The 12 March 2016 programme (#827) was broadcast in 360 degrees, and is the first entire episode of a TV programme to be broadcast as such.

On 6 July 2019 the show&#x27;s 1000th episode was broadcast. It consisted of an interactive episode where viewers could decide what to watch next.

In March 2021, the BBC announced that the technology department, including Click, would be relocating to Pacific Quay in Glasgow. The show stopped producing new episodes during April 2022 to facilitate the move, with repeats shown, and aired the first episode produced on Glasgow on 7 May 2022.

=== Botnet controversy ===
In 2009 the show and the BBC created some controversy when it aired a special episode highlighting the dangers of botnets and how easy it was to get caught in one. The show bought control of a botnet of some 22,000 infected computers (for &quot;a few thousand dollars&quot;) from a Russian hacker, and used it to send spam to an email address set up for the experiment and to perform a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on a website set up by Prev-X (an internet security company that provided technical support for the show). After the programme was made the computers on the botnet were sent a piece of software to remove the malware and a warning was sent to them telling the users what had happened and that they were vulnerable.

The response was mixed with the show receiving many emails both for and against the programme along with some negative press. The BBC was criticized by some legal consulting organisations as well as computer security companies. Computer security expert and senior technology consultant at Sophos, Graham Cluley, asked in his blog whether the BBC was breaking the Computer Misuse Act - which makes it an offence in the UK to access or modify a third-party computer without the owner&#x27;s consent. However internet security commentator Melih Abdulhayoğlu, founder of international computer security company Comodo Group, made a video in support of the BBC. Click rebutted criticisms by stating in its Twitter posts that: 

== Presenters and reporters==
In addition to presenters Kelly and Lewington, reporters include LJ Rich, Paul Carter, Marc Cieslak, Zoe Kleinman, Nick Kwek, Shiona McCallum, Alasdair Keane and Kitty Knowles. Former reporters include Dan Simmons, Omar Mehtab, Jen Copestake and Chris Fox.

Previous presenters of the show have included Stephen Cole who left the BBC to work for Al Jazeera International. Kate Russell left in August 2020 after 14 years being part of the &quot;Click&quot; team.

Other BBC journalists occasionally present segments of the programme.

<text>Jean Galbert de Campistron (3 August 1656 – 11 May 1723) was a French dramatist.

==Biography==
Campistron was born in Toulouse, France to a noble family.
At the age of seventeen he was wounded in a duel and sent to Paris. Here he became an ardent disciple of Racine.

He secured the patronage of the influential duchesse de Bouillon by dedicating &quot;Arminius&quot; to her, and in 1685 he scored his first success with &quot;Andronic&quot;, which disguised under other names the tragic story of Don Carlos and Elizabeth of France. The piece made a great sensation, but Campistron&#x27;s treatment is weak, and he failed to avail himself of the possibilities inherent in his subject.

Racine was asked by Louis Joseph, duc de Vendôme, to write the libretto of an opera to be performed at a &quot;fête&quot; given in honor of the Dauphin. He handed on the commission to Campistron, who produced &quot;Acis et Galatée&quot; for Lully&#x27;s music. Campistron had another success in &quot;Tiridate&quot; (1691), in which he treated, again under changed names, the biblical story of Amnon&#x27;s passion for his sister Tamar.

He wrote many other tragedies and two comedies, one of which, &quot;Le Jaloux Désabusé&quot;, has been considered by some judges to be his best work.

In 1686 he had been made intendant to the duc de Vendôme and followed him to Italy and Spain, accompanying him on all his campaigns.

<text>Lindsey Nelson (May 25, 1919 – June 10, 1995) was an American sportscaster best known for his long career calling play-by-play of college football and New York Mets baseball.

Nelson spent 17 years with the Mets and three years with the San Francisco Giants. For 33 years Nelson covered college football, including 26 Cotton Bowls, five Sugar Bowls, four Rose Bowls, and 14 years announcing syndicated Notre Dame games. He is in or honored by 13 separate Halls of Fame. Fans remember a talented broadcaster, an expert storyteller, and a true sports enthusiast. From his colorful jackets to his equally colorful broadcasts and enthusiastic manner of speaking, Nelson established himself as one of the industry&#x27;s leading sportscasters.

==Early life==
Nelson was born on May 25, 1919, in Pulaski, Tennessee, the third child of Jon and Asie Nelson. He graduated from Columbia Central High School in Columbia. He graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1941, taught English, and then served in the U.S. Army, where he was a captain in North Africa and Europe during World War II. He also served as a war correspondent and public relations specialist, and played on an Army baseball team managed by Harry Walker.

==Career==
Nelson broke into broadcasting in 1948 following a short career as a reporter in Columbia, Tennessee, for the &quot;Columbia Daily Herald&quot; newspaper. Nelson then returned to his alma mater in Knoxville, Tennessee to create and become the first play-by-play announcer for the Vol Network, broadcasting the college football games of the Tennessee Volunteers.

Affectionately known as &quot;Mr. New Year&#x27;s Day,&quot; Nelson subsequently did the play-by-play of the Cotton Bowl Classic for 26 seasons on CBS television, where he earned widespread recognition for his Tennessee drawl and signature opening greeting: &quot;Happy New Year; this is Lindsey Nelson in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.&quot; He also called many Army–Navy Games for CBS, including the 1963 contest in which instant replay was first introduced. (After the initial replay, it fell to Nelson to reassure viewers that Army had not scored again.) For 14 years Nelson was the syndicated television voice of Notre Dame football, and he also called the Mutual Broadcasting System&#x27;s Monday night radio broadcasts of NFL games from 1974 to 1977, in addition to NFL games for CBS television for many years.

Nelson began his national baseball broadcast career as one of Gordon McLendon&#x27;s radio announcers for the Liberty Broadcasting System, which primarily did recreations of games. After a stretch as an administrator with NBC Sports, he began doing the network&#x27;s baseball broadcasts in . He also broadcast college football, NBA and college basketball, and professional golf and tennis during his NBC tenure.

===New York Mets===
In , he was hired as the lead broadcaster by the expansion New York Mets, and for the next 17 seasons did both radio and television with Ralph Kiner and Bob Murphy. Nelson and Murphy were eventually honored with the Ford C. Frick Award, presented annually to an announcer for &quot;major contributions to baseball&quot; during a ceremony at the Baseball Hall of Fame. While with the Mets, Nelson made the first (and only) radio broadcast of a baseball game from directly above the field. On April 28, 1965, Nelson accompanied the team to the Houston Astrodome for their game against the Astros, and his producer noticed that there was a gondola suspended from the ceiling; Nelson and a broadcast executive agreed to be hoisted in the gondola to a point 208 feet above second base, and called the play-by-play, though as Nelson described it, &quot;At first, I couldn&#x27;t see anything except a lot of tiny figures. Everybody looked the same height... You couldn&#x27;t tell a line drive from a pop fly.&quot; The Mets lost, 12–9, and Nelson declined to repeat the stunt.
When Chicago White Sox pitcher and former Mets ace Tom Seaver went for his 300th victory in August 1985 against the host New York Yankees, the Yankees TV flagship station WPIX had Nelson call the final half-inning of Seaver&#x27;s history-making win.

===San Francisco Giants===
In , Nelson moved on to the San Francisco Giants, for whom he worked three seasons. He also worked with CBS Radio broadcasts of Major League Baseball in . He is remembered for being the announcer during the first NFL game on CBS to use &quot;instant replay&quot;, which he had to explain repeatedly during the game, reminding viewers that &quot;this is not live.&quot;

==Honors==
Nelson&#x27;s honors and awards include induction into the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in Salisbury, North Carolina in 1979; the New York Mets Hall of Fame in ; the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame in 1986; the Tuss McLaughry Service Award for sports broadcasting in 1988; the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988; the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990; and many more. He was awarded an Emmy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1991. Nelson was inducted into the University of Tennessee, Knoxville Army ROTC Hall of Fame in 2021. He is a member of the 2020 Class.

The Tennessee Volunteers baseball team&#x27;s home field was named Lindsey Nelson Stadium after him. Likewise, his high school alma mater of Columbia Central High School&#x27;s Stadium is also named in honor of Nelson.

==Personal life and retirement==
Television broadcasts featuring Nelson were notable for his multi-colored sports jackets. He reportedly owned 335 of them at one time. During a broadcast, his jackets often clashed with the set and produced a scintillation effect in the broadcast image. But he figured that if fans could see rather than just hear broadcasts, he might as well give them something interesting to talk about. Nelson&#x27;s television fashion sense was an inspiration for Jim Brockmire, the title character played by Hank Azaria in the IFC series.

After his retirement from active broadcasting, he moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, to an apartment across the Tennessee River from the University of Tennessee campus from which he had a view of Neyland Stadium, the Vols&#x27; home football field. He wrote an autobiographical memoir entitled &quot;Hello Everybody, I&#x27;m Lindsey Nelson&quot;, his landmark opening phrase.

Nelson died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at age 76 on June 10, 1995, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is buried in Polk Memorial Gardens in Columbia. His wife, Mickie, died in 1973. They had two daughters, Nancy and Sharon.

<doc id="632754" wikidata="Q474545" url="?curid=632754" title="Alpine Way">
<text>Alpine Way is a rural road located in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales, Australia. The road connects in the east to the New South Wales-Victorian border in the west, crossing the Murray River near Bringenbrong and Upper Towong.

==Route==
Alpine Way commences at the intersection with Kosciuszko Road in Jindabyne, on the eastern side of the Snowy Mountains, and heads in a south-westerly direction, adjacent to the Thredbo River and eventually past Thredbo. It then climbs and crosses the crest of the Great Dividing Range at Dead Horse Gap at an altitude of , then winds a descent down to and eventually crosses Snowy Creek at Murray Gorge at an altitude of , very close to the Murray River. Thereafter, it continues in a northerly direction around the western side of the range along the upper reaches of the Murray River Tributaries, crossing the Swampy Plain River at Geehi Hut and continuing northwards to . It then heads in a northwesterly direction to eventually cross the Murray River and terminate at Murray Valley Highway on the river&#x27;s southern bank, within Victoria.

The majority of the road is contained within Kosciuszko National Park and since 2004 has been maintained by Roads &amp; Maritime Services.

===Road restrictions===
Road restrictions in the region require all two-wheel drive vehicles carry snow chains between Thredbo and Tom Groggin from the long weekends marking the King&#x27;s Official Birthday in June and the Labour Day in October. It is also quite possible that snow chains may be needed to drive safely along other (more dangerous) parts of Alpine Way.

==History==
The road was initially built in the 1950s as part of the access for the Snowy Mountains Scheme. However, the paving of it was only completed approximately forty years later in the 1990s.

The Roads and Traffic Authority declared Main Road 627 along the western portion of Alpine Way, from the border with Victoria along Murray River in Bringenbrong through Khancoban to the western boundary of Kosciuszko National Park to its east, on 15 January 1993. Main Road 677 was declared along the eastern portion of Alpine Way, from Jindabyne to the eastern boundary of Kosciuszko National Park at Bullocks Flat, on 31 October 1997; this was extended west along the remaining section of Alpine Way to the western boundary of Kosciuszko National Park east of Khancoban on 17 May 2004.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Alpine Way retains its declaration as Main Roads 627 and 677.

<text>Boothferry is a village in the East Riding of Yorkshire in England. It is situated on the north bank of the River Ouse where the A614 road crosses the river. It is about north-west of Goole.

Boothferry is split between civil parishes; areas to the west of the B1228 road are in the civil parish of Asselby, and those to the east are in Howden.

Boothferry is home to Boothferry Bridge which, built in 1929, was for many years the first physical road crossing of the Ouse (if travelling inland), although a lower rail crossing was built at Goole in 1869. Boothferry Bridge was very heavily used by vehicles travelling between the north and south banks of the Humber before the opening of the M62 motorway in the mid-1970s and the Humber Bridge in 1981. Boothferry Bridge is celebrated in the song &quot;Boothferry Bridge&quot; written by Harvey Andrews and released in 1972 on his album &#x27;Writer of Songs&quot;&#x27; and by the musical group &quot;The Lonesome Travellers&quot;, which was released in the early 1970s. The M62 now crosses the Ouse on a viaduct approximately one mile downstream (east) of the old bridge.

Boothferry gave its name to the Boothferry borough of Humberside from 1974 to 1996, and to the Boothferry parliamentary constituency which, in 1997, was largely amalgamated into the Haltemprice and Howden constituency represented by David Davis MP. Boothferry was also chosen to be the name taken by a local resident when he took the title of lord in 2004. Boothferry has also lent its name to many roads and buildings along with businesses within the borough, although it is now defunct.

Hull City Football Club played from 1946 to 2002 at a football stadium named Boothferry Park, which also took its name from a road (the A63 – Boothferry Road) that leads from Hull to the village.

<doc id="632761" wikidata="Q1013176" url="?curid=632761" title="Thredbo, New South Wales">
<text>Thredbo is a village and ski resort in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. It is approximately south of Sydney, accessible by the Alpine Way via Cooma, Berridale and Jindabyne. The village is built in the valley of the Thredbo River, also known as the Crackenback River, at the foot of the Ramshead Range.

The town has approximately 4,150 beds, but a permanent population of only approximately 477 people. When the mountain is fully covered by snow, Thredbo has the longest ski runs in Australia, attracting approximately 700,000 winter visitors annually. In summer, Thredbo is a hiking and summer sport destination, offering rock climbing and abseiling, fishing, cross-country cycling and downhill MTB riding and hosts a blues music festival, with approximately 300,000 summer visitors (figures are ).

Thredbo resort was developed by a syndicate of people who were at the time working on the Snowy Mountains Scheme. In 1957, the syndicate was granted a head-lease over the area that Thredbo now occupies. Development occurred in the following years under Lendlease. In January 1987, Amalgamated Holdings Limited (AHL) purchased the head lease from Lendlease. Event Hospitality and Entertainment operates Thredbo village&#x27;s services, real estate, and lease arrangements as a public company; however, a range of private businesses operate around the year providing activities, shopping, restaurants, accommodation, tours and nightlife.

==History==

The origin of the name “Thredbo” has been attributed to the Aboriginal inhabitants of the Snowy Mountains.

Thredbo hosted the first race of the Men&#x27;s 1989 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup.

==Ski resort==

Thredbo is an Australian ski resort set within Kosciuszko National Park in NSW and was modelled on a European skiing town, reflecting the heritage of workers on the Snowy Mountains Scheme such as Tony Sponar, who is credited with having established the location as a ski field.
 Contrasting with the primarily lodge-based Perisher, Thredbo is a town with lodges, shopping and nightlife. Thredbo has 14 lifts: an 8-person gondola, 3 hi-speed quads, 1 quad, 5 t-bars, 1 double chair (following the removal of Merritts Chairlift in 2020, and the Ramshead Chairlift in 2010), and 3 snow runners.

Thredbo has the steepest overall terrain of any ski resort in mainland Australia, and also the highest lifted point ( AHD). From this highest access point at Karel&#x27;s T-Bar, the lease-holder Kosciuszko Thredbo and private adventure companies have access for backcountry ski tours to Mt. Kosciuszko and multiple other locations on the Main Range. Thredbo Village sits at the base of the Crackenback Valley, and due to its low altitude () the ski resort does not always retain snow on the lower half of the mountain as a result of higher temperatures, although temperature inversions at night and below zero temperatures enable snow making. Because of this, Thredbo has invested almost $6 million in the largest snowmaking system in the Southern Hemisphere, covering some 65 hectares of trail and using a three-stage automated process. The system is operated mainly at night to top up the lower half of the mountain and any other high traffic areas. The automated areas include the Supertrail, Friday Flat, High Noon, The Cruiser area&#x27;s Walkabout and Ballroom, Sundowner, Lovers Leap bypass, World Cup, and Lower True Blue.

Thredbo has over 50 ski runs and employs a standard 3-colour grade system; green for beginners, blue intermediate and black diamond advanced. The longest continual run is from the top of Karel&#x27;s T-Bar to Friday Flat and is 5.9 km long; however, this is composed of several trails. The longest single run is the &quot;Crackenback Supertrail&quot;, which is the longest run in Australia.

During the Vietnam War, Australia was one of the destinations soldiers could pick for a week-long R &amp; R. At Sydney Airport the USO had different activities that could be chosen if the soldier wished. One option was skiing at Thredbo at a reduced rate. The package included round trip transportation (part by air, part bus), lodging, breakfast and dinner, equipment, a group lesson, and a lift ticket. Also included were gloves, ski pants, and a warm jacket; soldiers in Vietnam didn&#x27;t have any of these items, and so needed them to be furnished.

At the end of the season, mats were placed on the lower slopes, enabling one to ski to the bottom.

The village offers a free shuttle bus service during winter that links the Valley Terminal, Friday Flat, and the majority of the ski lodges throughout the village.

===Safety Incidents===

On Monday July 22, 2019 an occupied chair fell from the Gunbarrel lift. This was similar to a 2016 incident where an unoccupied chair fell from the same spot. The resort blamed a &quot;freak gust of wind&quot;.

On Saturday 19 August 2023 another occupied chair fell from the line, this time on the Kosciusko Express chair. Three snowboarders were on the chair at the time. Once again the resort attributed the incident to a &quot;freak gust of wind&quot;.
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-20/nsw-thredbo-says-gust-of-wind-responsible-for-chairlift-accident/102752522

Despite the resort describing the injuries as &quot;minor&quot; two of the snowboarders were airlifted to Canberra Hospital with spinal injuries.

===Terrain parks===
Thredbo has several terrain parks;
*Wombat World— a terrain park for younger children, featuring bumps, fun boxes and arches. Located on Friday Flat.
*Merritts Park— A terrain park for beginners to intermediates, featuring jumps and boxes. It is located at the base of the Cruiser chairlift, and can be accessed from the Merritts Mountain House Restaurant. A T-bar runs from the base for exit from this park.
*Cruiser Park — This park features rails, boxes, big jumps and a picnic table. The layout is regularly changed. Located just below the top of &quot;The Cruiser&quot; chair.
*Antons Park— A terrain park for experienced freestyle skiers and boarders with large jumps, rails and a wall ride. Located on Antons.
*Ridercross— Changes location from year to year.

===Gunbarrel Express chairlift===
The Gunbarrel Express is a detachable quad chairlift in Thredbo. It runs from the Friday Flat beginners area to a point on The Traverse trail roughly halfway between the Central Spur and the Merritts Spur. The lift was constructed in 1988 as part of a thirty million (Australian) dollar investment in the mountain by its new owners, Amalgamated Holdings Limited. It is unique in Thredbo in that it crosses over other lifts, namely the Easy Does It fixed-grip quad and the Merritts fixed-grip double. This chairlift provides good access to a variety of runs and is convenient to the Woodridge and Friday Flat lodges, as well as major carparks.

Two runs, The Glades and Pegasus, run underneath the higher part of the Gunbarrel Express, with the former running into the latter. The lower half is significantly steeper, with many concealed obstacles, including a creek. Pegasus often suffers from only partial snow cover and is out-of-bounds for most of the season, only opening after significant snowfall.
Statistics:
*Base elevation: 
*Base location: Friday Flat
*Terminal elevation: 
*Terminal location: The Traverse, approx. halfway between Cruiser terminal and Antons base.
*Length: 
*Vertical Rise: 
*Average gradient: 1 in 3.9

===Merritts Gondola===

Merritts Gondola, built by Doppelmayr, opened in 2020 and is Australia&#x27;s first purpose-built Gondola. It replaced the previous Merritts Chairlift while quadrupling its capacity, lifting approximately 2,000 people per hour.

==1997 Thredbo landslide==
Eighteen people died when the Bimbadeen and Carinya lodges collapsed at Thredbo Alpine Village at 11:30 pm on 30 July 1997. John Cameron, a member of Brindabella Ski Club, and 17 residents of Bimbadeen Ski Lodge lost their lives when Carinya (owned by the Brindabella Ski Club) and Bimbadeen Lodges collapsed when the slope above Carinya Lodge slipped downhill, destroying Carinya. Bimbadeen Staff Lodge was then hit, and it too collapsed. Witnesses reported hearing &quot;a whoosh of air, a crack and a sound like a freight train rushing the hill&quot;. The sole survivor, Stuart Diver, was pulled from the wreckage after lying trapped for three days. Stuart was confined to a small space between two concrete slabs where his wife, Sally, drowned beside him in a torrent of water, which Stuart was able to keep his face above.

The landslide was caused by a water leak from a ruptured water pipe that ran alongside the Alpine Road situated above the two lodges. The leaking water pipe caused the ground to become lubricated, allowing the top layer to slip away from the lower part.

Brindabella Ski Club opened its new lodge on 5 June 2004.

==Climate==
Climate data for the area are taken from a station in the village at the bottom of the ski resort and another station at the top of the mountain—some higher. 

The climate of the area is typical of the Snowy Mountains; cold, snowy winters and cool to mild summers (summer snow is not uncommon in Thredbo). Temperatures have ranged from . In the Köppen climate classification Thredbo Village would fit the criteria of having a cold oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). The village receives an average of 34.9 snowy days annually. 

===Thredbo Top Station (AWS)===

The Thredbo Top Station (AWS) is significantly colder than the village and includes some of the lowest temperatures recorded in Australia, including a daily maximum of on 9 July 1978. Of mainland Australian sites only the Victorian peak of Mount Hotham is colder, which is lower in elevation but more exposed than Thredbo. On average, the Top Station receives 56.9 snowy days annually, falling in any month of the year.

According to Köppen, Thredbo Top Station would fit the criteria of having a Subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;); one with short, cool summers and long, cold winters. It is bordering on a Subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), as the mean temperature in its coolest month approaches . 

On 3 February 2023, Thredbo Top Station reached a maximum of just — its coldest on record for the height of summer. The coldest maximum temperature for any summer month was on 2 December 2019. Temperature records commenced in 1966 at Thredbo AWS.

==Other sporting activities==

===Thredbo Leisure Centre===
The Thredbo Leisure Centre, opened in 1996, houses a and indoor swimming pool, wading pool with a waterslide, an inflatable obstacle course (known as the &quot;Mission Inflatable&quot;), two full-size basketball courts, a gymnasium, squash courts, a physiotherapist and a traverse climbing wall. It has been used by the many high-profile athletes, including the Australian Institute of Sport for high-altitude training in the lead up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.

===Mountain biking===
Since the early 1990s, Thredbo has been popular during the summertime for recreational and competitive mountain biking, attracting serious racers from across Australia and overseas. There are kilometres of cross country singletrack and firetrail around Thredbo Village, the Thredbo golf course, and other trails connecting Thredbo to its neighbouring villages. Two local businesses operate cross-country mountain bike tours from Thredbo and across the Snowy Mountains region.

Thredbo is host to the world-renowned downhill track, the Cannonball Run, which is accessed by taking the Kosciusko Express Quad-Chairlift up to Eagles Nest. From Eagles Nest, the course runs back to the bottom of the chairlift, below. With approximately of fast singletrack, rock gardens, a wall-ride, tight switchbacks and multiple drops and jumps, the Cannonball Run is one of Australia&#x27;s longest downhill courses. The Cannonball Run is host to many races through the summer months, including national rounds, state rounds, the National Interschools Mountain Biking Competition. Track engineering has made a significant difference to the sustainability of downhill mountain biking in a sensitive alpine environment. Two Gravity Trails have been opened at Thredbo in the past 510 years, the Kosciuszko Flow Trail and the All Mountain Train offering a more varied level of riding from the technical Cannonball. The All Mountain Trail connects the National Parks and Wildlife Service installed Thredbo Valley Track, which follows the course of the Thredbo River from Thredbo Village through Ranger Station, Ngarigo Campgrounds and the Diggings Campgrounds to terminate at Lake Crackenback Resort.

The Thredbo Mountain-cross track, designed by Glen Jacobs, an Australian trail expert, opened in 2005. It is situated on Friday Flat and comprises a start gate, multiple doubles, rollers, berms, moguls, gaps, step-downs and step-ups. The track has hosted numerous races since its opening including national rounds, state rounds and the National Interschools Mountain Biking Competition.

=== Alpine Coaster ===
Due to open in the winter of 2024, the Alpine (Roller) Coaster is a 1.5km (0.93 mi) track through the Resort. Available year-round and reaching speeds of up to 40km (24.85 mi).

== Thredbo&#x27;s Sustainability Initiatives ==

=== Certification ===
Thredbo has achieved EarthCheck Sustainable Destinations Gold certification, aligning with its commitment to environmental responsibility and climate sustainability. This achievement is part of Thredbo&#x27;s broader strategy to reduce energy consumption and emissions, furthering its environmental conservation efforts.

=== Waste Reduction Efforts ===
The resort is actively working to diminish its waste generation impacts on the Snowy Mountains region. Recognising the limitations and environmental drawbacks of landfill waste, Thredbo has set targets to minimise waste-to-landfill by promoting waste avoidance, reuse, and recycling as viable alternatives.

=== Water Management ===
Thredbo&#x27;s location within the Australian Alps places it within the catchment areas of significant rivers like the Snowy and Murray Rivers. The resort acknowledges the importance of these water bodies in Australia&#x27;s freshwater system and is committed to responsible water usage. The Thredbo River, a crucial source for the resort&#x27;s water supply for drinking, washing, and swimming, is a key focus of their water conservation efforts.

=== Measuring Impact: &quot;Person Year&quot; Metric ===
To effectively measure and manage its waste-to-landfill and water usage, Thredbo employs the &quot;Person Year&quot; metric. This metric accounts for the amount of time an individual spends in Thredbo, allowing for a consistent annual comparison that takes into account the seasonal nature of tourism in the area. This approach is designed to encourage all residents, staff, and visitors of Thredbo to contribute to waste reduction and efficient water use.

<text>In mathematics Haboush&#x27;s theorem, often still referred to as the Mumford conjecture, states that for any semisimple algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot;, and for any linear representation ρ of &quot;G&quot; on a &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;V&quot;, given &quot;v&quot; ≠ 0 in &quot;V&quot; that is fixed by the action of &quot;G&quot;, there is a &quot;G&quot;-invariant polynomial &quot;F&quot; on &quot;V&quot;, without constant term, such that

:&quot;F&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) ≠ 0.

The polynomial can be taken to be homogeneous, in other words an element of a symmetric power of the dual of &quot;V&quot;, and if the characteristic is &quot;p&quot;&gt;0 the degree of the polynomial can be taken to be a power of &quot;p&quot;.
When &quot;K&quot; has characteristic 0 this was well known; in fact Weyl&#x27;s theorem on the complete reducibility of the representations of &quot;G&quot; implies that &quot;F&quot; can even be taken to be linear. Mumford&#x27;s conjecture about the extension to prime characteristic &quot;p&quot; was proved by W. J. , about a decade after the problem had been posed by David Mumford, in the introduction to the first edition of his book &quot;Geometric Invariant Theory&quot;.

==Applications==
Haboush&#x27;s theorem can be used to generalize results of geometric invariant theory from characteristic 0, where they were already known, to characteristic &quot;p&quot;&gt;0. In particular Nagata&#x27;s earlier results together with Haboush&#x27;s theorem show that if a reductive group (over an algebraically closed field) acts on a finitely generated algebra then the fixed subalgebra is also finitely generated.

Haboush&#x27;s theorem implies that if &quot;G&quot; is a reductive algebraic group acting regularly on an affine algebraic variety, then disjoint closed invariant sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; can be separated by an invariant function &quot;f&quot; (this means that &quot;f&quot; is 0 on &quot;X&quot; and 1 on &quot;Y&quot;).

C.S. Seshadri (1977) extended Haboush&#x27;s theorem to reductive groups over schemes.

It follows from the work of , Haboush, and Popov that the following conditions are equivalent for an affine algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot;:
*&quot;G&quot; is reductive (its unipotent radical is trivial).
*For any non-zero invariant vector in a rational representation of &quot;G&quot;, there is an invariant homogeneous polynomial that does not vanish on it.
*For any finitely generated &quot;K&quot; algebra on which &quot;G&quot; act rationally, the algebra of fixed elements is finitely generated.

==Proof==
The theorem is proved in several steps as follows:
*We can assume that the group is defined over an algebraically closed field &quot;K&quot; of characteristic &quot;p&quot;&gt;0.
*Finite groups are easy to deal with as one can just take a product over all elements, so one can reduce to the case of connected reductive groups (as the connected component has finite index). By taking a central extension which is harmless one can also assume the group &quot;G&quot; is simply connected.
*Let &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) be the coordinate ring of &quot;G&quot;. This is a representation of &quot;G&quot; with &quot;G&quot; acting by left translations. Pick an element &#x27; of the dual of &quot;V&quot; that has value 1 on the invariant vector &quot;v&quot;. The map &quot;V&quot; to &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) by sending &quot;w&quot;∈&quot;V&quot; to the element &quot;a&quot;∈&quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) with &quot;a&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) = &#x27;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;w&quot;)). This sends &quot;v&quot; to 1∈&quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), so we can assume that &quot;V&quot;⊂&quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) and &quot;v&quot;=1.
*The structure of the representation &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is given as follows. Pick a maximal torus &quot;T&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, and let it act on &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) by right translations (so that it commutes with the action of &quot;G&quot;). Then &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) splits as a sum over characters λ of &quot;T&quot; of the subrepresentations &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)λ of elements transforming according to λ. So we can assume that &quot;V&quot; is contained in the &quot;T&quot;-invariant subspace &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)λ of &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;).
*The representation &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)λ is an increasing union of subrepresentations of the form &quot;E&quot;λ+&quot;n&quot;ρ⊗&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ, where ρ is the Weyl vector for a choice of simple roots of &quot;T&quot;, &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer, and &quot;E&quot;μ is the space of sections of the line bundle over &quot;G&quot;/&quot;B&quot; corresponding to a character μ of &quot;T&quot;, where &quot;B&quot; is a Borel subgroup containing &quot;T&quot;.
*If &quot;n&quot; is sufficiently large then &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ has dimension (&quot;n&quot;+1)&quot;N&quot; where &quot;N&quot; is the number of positive roots. This is because in characteristic 0 the corresponding module has this dimension by the Weyl character formula, and for &quot;n&quot; large enough that the line bundle over &quot;G&quot;/&quot;B&quot; is very ample, &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ has the same dimension as in characteristic 0.
*If &quot;q&quot;=&quot;p&quot;&quot;r&quot; for a positive integer &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;n&quot;=&quot;q&quot;−1, then &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ contains the Steinberg representation of &quot;G&quot;(F&quot;q&quot;) of dimension &quot;q&quot;&quot;N&quot;. (Here F&quot;q&quot; ⊂ &quot;K&quot; is the finite field of order &quot;q&quot;.) The Steinberg representation is an irreducible representation of &quot;G&quot;(F&quot;q&quot;) and therefore of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;K&quot;), and for &quot;r&quot; large enough it has the same dimension as &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ, so there are infinitely many values of &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ is irreducible.
*If &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ is irreducible it is isomorphic to its dual, so &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ⊗&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ is isomorphic to End(&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;ρ). Therefore, the &quot;T&quot;-invariant subspace &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)λ of &quot;A&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is an increasing union of subrepresentations of the form End(&quot;E&quot;) for representations &quot;E&quot; (of the form &quot;E&quot;(&quot;q&quot;−1)ρ)). However, for representations of the form End(&quot;E&quot;) an invariant polynomial that separates 0 and 1 is given by the determinant. This completes the sketch of the proof of Haboush&#x27;s theorem.

<text>Glanford was, from 1974 to 1996, a local government district with borough status in the non-metropolitan county of Humberside, England.

==Creation==

The district was created on 1 April 1974 as part of a general reform of local government in England and Wales under the Local Government Act 1972. Among the innovations of the 1974 reorganisation was the creation of a new county of Humberside uniting areas of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire previously divided by the Humber estuary. Glanford was one of nine districts into which Humberside was divided.

Glanford was formed by merging three districts, previously part of the administrative county of Lincolnshire - Parts of Lindsey: Barton upon Humber Urban District, Brigg Urban District and Glanford Brigg Rural District. The borough was bounded by Cleethorpes to the east, Lincolnshire to the south, Boothferry to the west, and had a shore on the Humber estuary to the north. It entirely surrounded the Borough of Scunthorpe.

==Abolition==

Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England, both the County of Humberside and Borough of Glanford were abolished on 1 April 1996. Four unitary authorities replaced both the county council and nine district councils, and Glanford was merged with the Borough of Scunthorpe and part of the Borough of Boothferry to form the unitary authority of North Lincolnshire.

<text>The City of Carlisle ( , ) was a local government district of Cumbria, England, with the status of a city. It was named after its largest settlement, Carlisle, but covered a far larger area which included the towns of Brampton and Longtown, as well as outlying villages including Dalston, Scotby and Wetheral. In 2011 the district had a population of 107,524, and an area of .

The district boundaries were set as part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, and covered an amalgamation of two former local government districts, the City and County Borough of Carlisle and the Border Rural District of Cumberland. The district shared a border with Scotland (to the north), and was bounded on the southwest by the borough of Allerdale, and on the south by the district of Eden. The county of Northumberland was to the east.

Although the district boundaries dated to the 20th century, the city traces its origins to a 1st-century Roman outpost associated with Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. The Brythonic settlement that expanded from this outpost was destroyed by the Danes in 875. Thereafter the region formed part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland, until colonised under King William II of England in 1092. William II built Carlisle Castle, which houses a military museum. Carlisle Cathedral, founded in the 12th century, is one of the smallest in England.

A border city, and the third most northerly city in England, Carlisle district predominantly spanned the flood plain of the River Eden. Commercially, it was linked to the rest of England via the M6 motorway, and to the Scottish Lowlands via the A74(M) and M74 motorways.

In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that in April 2023, Cumbria would be reorganised into two unitary authorities. On 1 April 2023, Carlisle City Council was abolished and its functions transferred to the new unitary authority of Cumberland, which also incorporates the former districts of Allerdale and Copeland.

From 1 April 2023 the &quot;City of Carlisle&quot; was redefined to cover the following wards: Belah and Kingmoor, Botcherby and Harraby North, Cathedral and Castle, Currock and Upperby, Denton Holme and Morton South, Harraby South and Parklands, Newtown and Morton North, Sandsfield and Morton West and Stanwix and Houghton.

Charter Trustees were formed from the councillors that cover the said areas; they act as appropriate bodies in which historic rights and privileges of Carlisle, including the Mayoralty will continue until a governance review will determine the need of a Town Council.

==History==

Following both the Local Government Act 1888 and Local Government Act 1894, local government in England had been administered via a national framework of rural districts, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county boroughs, which (apart from the latter which were independent), shared power with strategic county councils of the administrative counties. The areas that were incorporated into the City of Carlisle district in 1974 had formed part of the Border Rural District from the administrative county of Cumberland, and the politically independent County Borough of Carlisle.

After the exploration of reform during the mid-20th century such as the proposals made by the Redcliffe-Maud Report in the late 1960s, the Local Government Act 1972 restructured local government in England by creating a system of two-tier metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties and districts throughout the country. The act formally established the City of Carlisle as a local government district of the new shire county of Cumbria on 1 April 1974. The new dual local authorities of Carlisle City Council and Cumbria County Council had been running since elections in 1973 however. The leading article in &quot;The Times&quot; on the day the Local Government Act came into effect claimed that the &quot;new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively&quot;.

==Governance==

===Parliamentary constituencies===
The residents of the City of Carlisle district were represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by members of parliament (MPs) for two parliamentary constituencies. At the 2019 general election, Conservative Party MPs won the seats of Carlisle and Penrith and The Border, John Stevenson and Neil Hudson respectively.

===Council===

In 1974, Carlisle City Council was created to administer the newly formed non-metropolitan district, which shared power with the strategic Cumbria County Council. The council offices were in Carlisle, at the Civic Centre. The Labour Party controlled the council for much of the first 25 years and from 1979 to the 1999 election had an overall majority. Until 2003 the Conservative Party then controlled the council with a majority, and from the 2003 elections they ran the council with no majority, but in alliance with the Liberal Democrats. At the 2012 election Labour gained a majority of the seats, which they held until the 2019 local election when the Conservative Party retook the council with the backing of the one Liberal Democrat, one UKIP councillor, and an Independent. In May 2021, three city council by-elections took place, triggered by the departure of three Labour councillors, that resulted in two Conservative gains from Labour.

In November 2021, the former chair of the Labour Party, Jo Ellis-Williams, joined the Conservatives to give overall control of the council to the Conservative Party.

====Electoral wards====
There were 39 councillors representing the electoral wards of the City of Carlisle district. Together they formed the Carlisle City Council. Councillors were elected and accountable to the residents of their wards.

====Parishes====

Civil parishes form the bottom tier of local government in England; parish councils are consulted on planning applications and commonly manage some local services, such as allotments, burial grounds, bus shelters, car parks, and commons. The City of Carlisle district was almost entirely parished, the exception being the central settlement of Carlisle—an unparished area. As of 2008, there were 36 civil parishes in the district, covered by 34 parish councils, which are:

====Coat of arms====

The coat of arms of Carlisle City Council were those granted to the city council of the County Borough of Carlisle by the College of Arms on 7 July 1924. These arms were derived from more ancient designs of or relating to Carlisle and its governance.

The city council&#x27;s coat of arms were emblematic of the city&#x27;s history. The arms incorporated a golden shield with a red cross, upon a green mount, surmounted by a mural crown, relating to Carlisle&#x27;s history as an ancient walled city. This was supported by two red wyverns—legendary dragons used in heraldry—their wings strewn with golden roses, with reference to the city&#x27;s Brythonic history. The motto beneath the arms came from Thomas Wolsey&#x27;s speech to Thomas Cromwell, in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;Henry VIII&quot;: &quot;Be just and fear not.&quot;

==Geography==
The City of Carlisle district was at the extreme north of North West England. It encompassed Cumbria&#x27;s county town, Carlisle, and its surrounding rural hinterland, which together totalled , making the district the largest in England by area. Although 70% of the district&#x27;s 100,750 people lived in central Carlisle, 98% of the district&#x27;s land use was rural. The district was traversed by several major rivers, including the Caldew, Eden, and Petteril, and was bisected by the M6, A74(M) motorways.

Along the City of Carlisle&#x27;s northern extent was the Solway Firth, which forms the western section of the Anglo-Scottish border, and thus separated the district from Dumfries and Galloway, one of the council areas of Scotland. To the east was the English county of Northumberland; to the south was the former district of Eden and to the west and south-west the former borough of Allerdale, both in the county of Cumbria.

Much of the district spanned the flood plain of the River Eden resulting in large parts of the district being vulnerable to flooding. Two further tributaries, the Petteril and Caldew nearly surround the historic walled centre.

Carlisle experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;).

==Demography==

At the 2011 UK census, the City of Carlisle district had a total population of 107,524. 46.8% of the residents over the age of 16 were married or in a registered same-sex civil partnership, 11.9% were co-habiting couples, and 41.2% were not living in a couple.

In 1841, 15.7% of Carlisle&#x27;s population was middle class compared to 14% in England and Wales; this increased to 18.9% in 1931 (15% nationally) and 35.7% in 2001 (48% nationally). Carlisle&#x27;s proportion of working-class people increased slowly from 1841 to 1931, changing from 33.0% to 37.9 while the national average changed from 37% to 36% in the same period. Since 1931 it has fallen and risen again to 34.0% in 2001 (26% nationally). The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers.

===Population change===
The table below details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last available census data. Although the City of Carlisle has existed as a district since 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that would later be constituent parts of the city.

===Religion===
At the 2011 UK census, 69.1% of Carlisle&#x27;s residents reported themselves as Christian, 22.9% had no religion and 6.8% did not state any religion. Other religions were represented with 0.4% of residents Muslim, 0.3% Buddhist, 0.2% Hindu and 0.3% had an alternative religion. The district was covered by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lancaster, and the Church of England Diocese of Carlisle.

==Economy==

At the United Kingdom Census 2001, Carlisle had 73,431 residents aged 16 to 74. Of these people, 2.4% were students with jobs, 3.1% students without jobs, 4.9% looking after home or family, 6.1% permanently sick or disabled and 2.3% economically inactive for other reasons.

In 2001, of 46,858 residents of the City of Carlisle district in employment, the industry of employment was 20.4% retail and wholesale, 15.9% manufacturing, 11.1% health and social work, 8.1% property and business services, 7.7% transport and communications, 7.3% construction, 6.4% education, 5.9% hotels and restaurants, 5.8% public administration and defence, 3.1% agriculture, 2.3% finance, 0.7% energy and water supply, 0.3% mining, and 4.5% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, although the proportion of jobs in agriculture which was more than the national average of 1.5% and the percentage of people working in finance was less than half the national average of 4.8%; the proportion of people working in property was also below the national average of 13.2%.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Carlisle railway station is on the West Coast Main Line and serves the Settle and Carlisle Line, Tyne Valley Line, Cumbrian Coast Line and trains to South West Scotland.

===Air===
The city has an airport, Carlisle Lake District Airport, owned by Ettyl. After a 25-year absence, commercial flights returned to the airport in July 2019 with a single airline, Loganair, providing services to London Southend, Belfast City and Dublin. In March 2020, however, the airline permanently suspended all flights from the airport due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Buses===

<doc id="632774" wikidata="Q988298" url="?curid=632774" title="Charlotte Pass, New South Wales">
<text>Charlotte Pass (often erroneously referred to as Charlotte&#x27;s Pass) is a snow resort and village in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. The pass is in the Kosciuszko National Park where the Kosciuszko Road crosses Kangaroo Ridge. Charlotte Pass is the closest village to Mount Kosciuszko, the tallest mountain in Australia.

Charlotte Pass Village is at the base of Kangaroo Ridge to the south east of the pass. It is one of Australia&#x27;s oldest snow resorts. It is the coldest location in Australia, with a record low of and winter temperatures that regularly drop below .

The pass and village are named after Charlotte Adams, who, in 1881, was the first European woman to climb Mount Kosciuszko.

Charlotte Pass provides access to some of Australia&#x27;s highest alpine terrain and was formerly a stop-off point for public vehicular access to Mount Kosciuszko, though the public access road now terminates at the Pass. Being an alpine area, it is subject to extremes in temperature, and is a recognised environmentally sensitive zone.

==History==
The Snowy Mountains region is thought to have had Aboriginal occupation for some twenty thousand years. Large scale intertribal gatherings were held in the High Country during summer for collective feasting on the Bogong moth. This practice continued until around 1865. The area was first explored by Europeans in 1835, and in 1840, Edmund Strzelecki ascended Mount Kosciuszko and named it after a Polish patriot. High country stockmen followed who used the Snowy Mountains for grazing during the summer months. Banjo Paterson&#x27;s famous poem &quot;The Man From Snowy River&quot; recalls this era. The cattle graziers have left a legacy of mountain huts scattered across the area. Charlotte Pass itself is named after Charlotte Adams who, in 1881, became the first European woman to climb Mount Kosciuszko, Australia&#x27;s highest peak.

The Kosciuszko National Park in which Charlotte Pass is situated came into existence as the National Chase Snowy Mountains on 5 December 1906. In April 1944, following the passage of the Kosciusko State Park Act, the Kosciusko State Park was proclaimed. In 1967, this became the Kosciusko National Park, renamed Kosciuszko National Park in 1997.

The historic Kosciuszko Chalet was the first building at Charlotte Pass village, and was opened on 10 May 1930. The Chalet at Charlotte Pass was one of several alpine area accommodation facilities built by government in Australia, and offered an opulent life style at the time. The Chalet burnt down in August 1938, and a new Chalet was built in its place the following summer. The Chalet is still the largest and most significant building in the village, and remains the heart of the village in winter.

Skiing in Australia had begun some six decades earlier at Kiandra in the Northern Snowy Mountains, but the first Kosciuszko Chalet built at Charlotte Pass in 1930 gave relatively comfortable access to Australia&#x27;s highest terrain. At 1760m, Charlotte Pass has the highest village base elevation of any Australia ski resort and can only be accessed via over-snow transport in winter. The growing number of ski enthusiasts heading to Charlotte Pass led to the establishment of a cafe at Smiggin Holes around 1939, where horse-drawn sleighs would deliver skiers to the start of the arduous ski to the Kosciuszko Chalet. It was the construction of the vast Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme from 1949 that really opened up the Snowy Mountains for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of nearby Thredbo and Perisher as leading Australian resorts. Kosciusko Alpine Club was the first ski club to build its own lodge here in 1952, having occupied the Chalet earlier. Other club lodges were built soon after.

Ski fields beyond Charlotte Pass and up by Kosciuszko&#x27;s side were also established during this period, though their existence is now little realised. The Australian Alpine Club was founded in 1950 by Charles Anton with a view to establishing a chain of lodges for ski touring across the Australian Alps. Huts were constructed in the &quot;Back Country&quot; close to Mount Kosciuszko, including Kunama Hut, which opened for the 1953 season. A rope tow was installed on Mount Northcote at the site and opened in 1954. The site proved excellent for speed skiing, but the hut was destroyed in an avalanche, which also killed one person, in 1956. In 1964, Australia briefly boasted the &quot;World&#x27;s Longest Chairlift&quot;, designed to carry skiers from the Thredbo Valley to Charlotte Pass, but technical difficulties soon closed the facility.

For many decades, Charlotte Pass was a stop off point on the road offering public vehicular access to Mount Kosciuszko, however the Kosciuszko Road now terminates at Charlotte Pass. The last 9 kilometres leading to Mount Kosciuszko have been closed, for environmental reasons, since 1982.

The village and resort precinct are part of the Kosciuszko National Park, and the village is leased to and operated by Charlotte Pass Village Pty Ltd (CPV) until at least October 2017. Apart from the Chalet, the village contains 12 commercial and club lodges, and has the capacity to hold 607 guests.

==Climate==
Charlotte Pass has a Subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfc&quot;) if using the −3 °C/27 °F isotherm or a Subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) using the 0 °C/32 °F isotherm, though the higher peaks have a Tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;). It has the lowest recorded temperature in Australia (excluding Antarctic territories), of on 28 June 1994. There are an average of 55.7 snowy days annually, being equal to Macquarie Island on this metric.

Annual rain fall averages 2329.6 mm, with about half falling as snow between May and September, although conditions result in the snowpack typically never exceeding 2.5 m to 3 m. Official snow depths are not recorded for Charlotte Pass, but are recorded by the Snowy Hydro Limited at nearby Spencers Creek (elev. 1,830 m). A typical snow depth at its peak is about 2 m. Summer rain is usually in the form of thunderstorms, which, due to the area&#x27;s elevation, can carry large quantities of hail, and severe hailstorms generally occur a few times each summer.

Snow has been recorded at all times of the year, some persisting on the ground for weeks even at the height of summer. While snowfalls at unexpected times can add interest to the area, they are typically associated with very severe weather events, which can also cause havoc with disastrous consequences. For example, weather patterns bringing snow on Boxing Day and the following day in 1998 caused loss of life in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race that year.

The apparent reduction in rainfall owes largely to the lack of a heated rain gauge after 1990, which leads to unregistered precipitation when a great mass of snow accumulates. This is evident by the greatly reduced cool-season rainfall in particular, as much of that would have fallen as snow and gone unregistered by the new gauge.

==Wildlife==
The area has been long been used as a base for environmental research, for example for plankton studies in the nearby post glacial lake Blue Lake in 1937 using a flat bottomed boat, and more recently, for example in 1997 as a heliport for studies of the mountain pygmy possum.

Of major faunal significance is the endangered mountain pygmy possum (&quot;Burramys parvus&quot;), which from 1894 until 1966 was only known from the fossil record, and the threatened broad-toothed mouse. These small marsupials are adapted to mountain life, however most other Australian animals find it hard to survive the cold climate and heavy snow. Animals that do manage to survive in the area and are occasionally seen include eastern grey kangaroos, wombats, platypus, crows, magpies, crimson rosellas, flame robins, and introduced animals such as rabbits, foxes and red deer.

==Recreation==

=== Skiing===
An area between Kangaroo Ridge, Mount Stilwell ridge, and Guthries Ridge is formally designated as the Charlotte Pass Alpine Resort.

It is the oldest and highest ski resort in Australia.

The resort contains five ski lifts, one triple chairlift, one T-bar, two platter lifts and a beginner&#x27;s moving carpet (which replaced a rope tow in 2008), accessing 50 hectares of skiable terrain. These lifts are commonly referred to as the Kosciuszko Triple Chair, the Pulpit T-bar, the Basin Poma, Guthrie&#x27;s High Speed Poma and the Kosciusko Carpet (colloquially known as the &#x27;Kosci Carpet&#x27;). The highest lifted elevation is 1,964 m; the base elevation 1,755 m; giving a downhill skier&#x27;s vertical of 210 m. The resort currently only lifts to part of its leased area. A small terrain park was first constructed in 2008. The resort has a few mobile snow guns to top up high traffic areas and help open difficult terrain areas earlier in the season. A list of all ski lifts to have operated at Charlotte Pass can be found at the Australian Ski Lift Directory.

The resort is also very popular with cross-country skiers, as the village provides immediate access to Australia&#x27;s highest peaks.

The resort receives, on average, more natural snow than other Australian resorts because of its elevation. In 1981, one weather event dropped snow to the extent that the Kangaroo Ridge triple chair terminus was buried in snow, over the top of the pylon, by the cornice by up to 0.5 m. This level of snow fall is an exception.

The Charlotte Pass ski area might be the only area in Australia with viable natural snow in several years&#x27; time, owing to the impact of global warming.

===Cycling===

=== Kosciuszko Main Range Walks===

During the summer, Charlotte Pass is a base for bushwalkers with intent to walk to the top of Mount Kosciuszko and access the Main Range. The mountain can be accessed by the 18 km round trip Summit Walk, or a 22 km loop walk via the glacial Lakes Walk. A fine view of the Main Range and headwaters of the Snowy River can be seen from the Snow Gums Boardwalk at Charlotte&#x27;s Pass and the walk to the summit traverses sub-alpine woodland on the Guthrie Range. Mount Kosciuszko itself is visible from the first lookout.

The Charlotte Pass to Kosciuszko walk follows the old Summit Road, which was closed to vehicles in 1976. It crosses the Snowy River at 4.5 km and then ascends gradually to Seaman&#x27;s Hut (6 km), Rawson&#x27;s Pass (8 km) and finally, the summit of Mount Kosciuszko.

The Charlotte Pass to Blue Lake walk crosses the Snowy River before ascending through alpine herbfields past Hedley Tarn lookout to Blue Lake lookout. The Blue Lake is one of only four cirque lakes found in mainland Australia and contains the best-developed glacial features in the Kosciuszko National Park alpine area of New South Wales. The Lake can be accessed by a 4-hour round-trip walk from Charlotte Pass.

A shorter and easier walk to the Kosciuszko summit can be accessed via Thredbo. Other guided walks are also available.

==Access==
In summer, access is by Kosciuszko Road from Jindabyne.

In winter, the area is snow-bound and can only be accessed by snowmobile from the Perisher Valley Skitube Alpine Railway terminal, which lies 8 kilometres to the north east, also via Jindabyne. Charlotte Pass Village Pty Ltd operates a fleet of vehicles to ferry people into and out of the village during winter.

The area has not always been regarded as being easily accessible to all people. In the mid 20th century, the Chalet at Charlotte Pass was referred to as a &quot;breeding ground for snobocracy&quot; by local politician John Wesley Seiffert who by public criticism obtained a reduced bus fare to the area, thus opening the snowfields to a wider range of people.

==Management and Services==
The area is subject to a wide range of government legislation and environmental plans, and, owing to the environmental sensitivity of the area, is one of the most heavily regulated areas in Australia.

Services such as garbage collection and sewage processing are the responsibility of the area&#x27;s lessee.

Private services at the resort include a ski and snowboard school/instructors, over-snow transport such as Pisten Bully snow cats and a ski patrol service.

<text>Congleton was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district with borough status in Cheshire, England. It included the towns of Congleton, Alsager, Middlewich and Sandbach. The headquarters of the borough council were located in Sandbach.

==History==

The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 by the merger of the former borough of Congleton, the urban districts of Alsager, Middlewich and Sandbach, and the Congleton Rural District. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

In 2006 the Department for Communities and Local Government considered reorganising Cheshire&#x27;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The decision to merge the boroughs of Congleton, Macclesfield, and Crewe and Nantwich to create a single unitary authority was announced on 25 July 2007, following a consultation period in which a proposal to create a single Cheshire unitary authority was rejected.

The Borough of Congleton was abolished on 31 March 2009, with the area becoming part of the unitary authority of Cheshire East on 1 April 2009.

==Civil parishes==
Congleton was divided into 23 civil parishes and included no unparished areas. Of the 23 civil parishes, four were administered at this level of local government by town councils: Alsager, Middlewich, Sandbach, and Congleton; with the remainder having parish councils. There are two pairs of civil parishes that are grouped together so that they share a parish council. These are Hulme Walfield and Somerford Booths, whose single parish council is called &quot;Hulme Walfield and Somerford Booths Parish Council&quot;, and Newbold Astbury and Moreton cum Alcumlow, whose single parish council is called &quot;Newbold Astbury-cum-Moreton Parish Council&quot;.

The following civil parishes were included in the borough:

* Alsager &quot;(town)&quot;
* Arclid
* Betchton
* Bradwall
* Brereton
* Church Lawton
* Congleton &quot;(town)&quot;
* Cranage
* Goostrey
* Hassall
* Holmes Chapel
* Hulme Walfield
* Middlewich &quot;(town)&quot;
* Moreton cum Alcumlow
* Moston
* Newbold Astbury
* Odd Rode
* Sandbach &quot;(town)&quot;
* Smallwood
* Somerford
* Somerford Booths
* Swettenham
* Twemlow
==Demographics==

===Religion===

==Political control==
The town of Congleton had been a municipal borough from 1836 to 1974 with a borough council. The first elections to the new Congleton Borough created under the Local Government Act 1972 were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was held by the following parties:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council from 1987 were:

===Composition===
The political composition of the council at its abolition in 2009 was:

==Premises==
The council was based at Westfields on Middlewich Road in Sandbach. This was a large nineteenth century house which had been bought in 1960 by the Congleton Rural District Council, one of the council&#x27;s predecessors. In 2005–2007 a replacement headquarters building, also called Westfields, was built in front of the old house, which was then demolished. The new building was formally opened on 25 January 2008. After Congleton Borough Council&#x27;s abolition, Westfields became the headquarters for the new Cheshire East Council.

<text>Anglesey Abbey is a National Trust property in the village of Lode, northeast of Cambridge, England. The property includes a country house, built on the remains of a priory, 98 acres (400,000 m2) of gardens and landscaped grounds, and a working mill.
The priory was closed in 1536 during the dissolution of the monasteries and a Jacobean-style house was built on the site of the ruins in about 1600. Owners down the centuries included Thomas Hobson and his Parker descendants, and three local clergymen. The last private owner was Lord Fairhaven who lived in the house from 1926 until he died in 1966. He made extensive additions to the house to accommodate his collection of furniture, art, books and objets d&#x27;art and landscaped the grounds. On his death, he left the house and its contents to the National Trust.

==History==

Anglesey Abbey was built on the remains of a priory of Augustinian Canons regular, which was founded as a hospital of St Mary during the reign of Henry I (i.e., between 1100 and 1135) and endowed as a priory by Richard de Clare in 1212. The priory was closed in 1536 during the dissolution of the monasteries. Three years later it was granted to a lawyer, John Hynde. The priory was largely demolished and materials used in the construction of Madingley Hall.

The Fowkes family acquired the property in 1595 and converted what remained of the demolished priory into a Jacobean-style house. The walls of the chapter house were incorporated into the main part of the domestic dwelling, with the calefactory or monks&#x27; day room to the north left as an outbuilding. Subsequent owners included the Cambridge carrier Thomas Hobson (of &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot;), his son-in-law barrister Thomas Parker and descendants, Cambridgeshire MP Samuel Shepheard and his daughter Lady Irvine, and George Leonard Jenyns. Owners did not always occupy the house themselves; it was leased out as a farmhouse at times. By the time Thomas Parker died in 1643 the property was known as Anglesey Abbey, rather than Priory.

In 1848 Reverend John Hailstone, vicar of the neighbouring parish of Bottisham, son of botanist Samuel Hailstone and nephew of a geologist John Hailstone, purchased Anglesey Abbey and carried out restorations, converting the monks&#x27; day room into an entrance hall, adding a service wing and building a stable block from remaining medieval masonry. Several sketches he made of the house survive. He was also responsible for planting trees, including cedars, wellingtonia, weeping elm and silver lime, along the drive to the house. Reverend Hailstone lived in the house after his resignation as vicar of Bottisham in 1861 until he died in 1877. His widow sold it in 1888 to the Reverend James George Clark, who lived there with his family until 1912, when he was given a living in Hertfordshire and tenants were found for Anglesey Abbey.
Anglesey Abbey was sold in 1926 to two brothers, Urban Huttleston Broughton (later 1st Baron Fairhaven) and Henry Rogers Broughton, who purchased it for its proximity to the horse-racing town of Newmarket and their stud at Great Barton near Bury St Edmunds. The brothers had inherited a fortune from their maternal grandfather, an American oil baron Henry Huttleston Rogers, and could live a life of leisure devoting themselves to owning and breeding racehorses, collecting art and creating gardens. The brothers made several alterations to the house soon after they bought it, converting the monks&#x27; day room from an entrance hall into a dining room, moving the front porch, adding a stone newell staircase and putting in fireplaces and panelling. The work was done by architect Sidney Parvin from the London firm of interior designers Turner Lord, and featured in a 1930 edition of &quot; Country Life&quot;.

Henry moved out when he married in 1932, leaving his older brother, by then Lord Fairhaven (having been given the barony that was about to be bestowed on his father, Urban H. Broughton, when he died) as the last private owner of Anglesey Abbey. Lord Fairhaven made extensive additions to the house to provide room for his rapidly expanding collection of books, paintings, tapestries, clocks, furniture and objets d&#x27;art. The library wing, designed by Sidney Parvin, was added in 1937 and was followed by the Tapestry Hall, a staircase hall off the dining room, in 1939. In 1934 Lord Fairhaven bought and restored Lode Mill on the boundary of his property. The mill had been built in the 18th century but had been converted to grind cement rather than corn in 1900.

Lord Fairhaven converted the grounds of Anglesey Abbey, which had been largely meadow and grazing land when the brothers bought the property, into an 18th-century style park with avenues of trees, flower gardens, statuary and ornaments. The final addition to the house, a two-storey picture gallery designed by Sir Albert Richardson, was completed in 1956.

When Lord Fairhaven died in 1966, Anglesey Abbey was left to the National Trust together with an endowment of £300,000. Lord Fairhaven had stated in his will that the house should be preserved as &quot;a complete and furnished entity so that it retains as far as possible the character of an English Home&quot;.

==Interior==

In addition to its Grade I listing, the house is also notable for its contents. Lord Fairhaven&#x27;s collection includes furniture, paintings and sculptures, clocks, tapestries, books, and objets d&#x27;art and, according to the author of a guide to Anglesey Abbey, expresses &quot;an eclectic taste and refreshing disregard for fashion&quot;.

Rooms open to the public include the living room that initially formed the chapter house of the monastery and dates from the 13th century; the &quot;oak room&quot; with its oak panelling and plaster ceiling copied from that of the Reindeer Inn at Banbury; the dining room formed from the monks&#x27; day room; the tapestry hall; the service wing; the library, where various royal visitors have engraved their names on a window; several first floor bedrooms; and the two-storey picture gallery.

Furniture includes an Italian Renaissance refectory table in the dining room, chairs embroidered by Lord Fairhaven&#x27;s mother in the living room, a white japanned Chippendale dressing table that once belonged to actor David Garrick in one of the bedrooms, and bookshelves made from the piles of John Rennie&#x27;s Waterloo Bridge in the library. The tapestry collection includes, as well as seventeenth-century works, one commissioned by Lord Fairhaven from the Cambridge Tapestry Company depicting Anglesey Abbey and the Fairhaven coat-of-arms. There are a large number of clocks in the house with pride of place going to a four-tier pagoda-shaped clock in the living room.

The art collection at Anglesey Abbey reflects Lord Fairhaven&#x27;s taste for British painting of the nineteenth century and earlier, with a particular fondness for views of Windsor Castle, landscapes, animal and bird paintings, and nudes by William Etty. The twentieth century is represented by paintings by Alfred Munnings, including a picture of a drum horse of the 1st Life Guards (Lord Fairhaven&#x27;s old regiment), and a portrait by Oswald Birley of Lord Fairhaven in the ceremonial uniform of his regiment. There are paintings by John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough (a rare seascape), Richard Parkes Bonington, Edwin Landseer and the Pether family as well as a series of Tudor portrait panels. Lord Fairhaven collected over 750 paintings, prints and drawings of Windsor Castle. His interest in the castle dates from his youth when his parents had a country house near Windsor, and from when he was later stationed at the castle with his regiment. The Windsor collection was catalogued by art historian Cyril Bunt in 1949. Although most of the paintings in Anglesey Abbey are by British artists, foreign artists are represented in the Windsor collection and there are also flower pieces by Ambrosius Bosschaert and Jean-Baptiste de Fontenay, as well as three paintings by Claude Lorrain. Sculpture in the collection includes 18th-century marble horses, a 15th-century continental wooden figure of St Jerome, a bronze bull by Antoine-Louis Barye, and a collection of bronzes by R. Tait McKenzie, Frederic Leighton, Alfred Gilbert and others, and a silver Shield of Achilles by John Flaxman.

The library at Anglesey Abbey contains over 6000 books, mostly ordinary reading books in fine bindings with about a thousand collector&#x27;s books.

==Grounds==

The 98 acres (400,000 m2) of Grade II* listed landscaped grounds at Anglesey Abbey are divided into several avenues, walks, vistas, and gardens, with classical statuary and flowerbeds. It was Lord Fairhaven who laid out the grounds in the style of an eighteenth-century park. He was responsible for replanting the rose garden and creating the dahlia garden, the herbaceous garden, the hyacinth garden and the Narcissus garden (so called because it has a statue of Narcissus in it) for seasonal bedding. To commemorate the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937, Lord Fairhaven planted an extensive avenue of trees with a crossing avenue at the far end. The trees used were London plane alternating with horse chestnut in four rows, copying those planted in Windsor Great Park. Storm damage in 1968 removed most of the plane trees leaving only the horse chestnut trees. The Temple Lawn was created in 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In front of the house to the south there is a formal lawn and beyond it is a meadow where earthworks mark the position of fishponds from the original priory.

In 1964 American landscape gardener Lanning Roper wrote a book, &quot;The Gardens of Anglesey Abbey&quot;, in which he described the careful planning of the garden with its many vistas, avenues, rare and common trees, pools, statues and river temples. He describes how huge areas of sky and mown grass were used to balance symmetrical planting and how Lord Fairhaven used the trees and shrubs to make groups of contrasting colour and foliage. Three generations of the local Ayres family have worked in the gardens since 1921, with Noel and Richard becoming head gardeners. A Winter Garden was opened in 1998 in Lord Fairhaven&#x27;s memory. In 2013 Richard Todd, head gardener at Anglesey Abbey since 1974, received the British Empire Medal for his years of service to the trust and national heritage. In 1999 he had been responsible for establishing a composting system to improve drainage and help retain water in a drought. Ten years later 95% of garden waste was composted.
To the north-west of the house, a block of farm buildings was converted into a large bungalow, complete with a swimming pool, to serve as the Summer House for the Fairhaven family in the days when they used to occupy Anglesey Abbey house in the winter before they moved to Kirtling Tower in 2004.

The grounds are bounded on the northwest by Bottisham Lode, with Lode Mill, bought and restored by Lord Fairhaven in 1934, at its head. To the south of the mill is the quarry pool, a large pool believed to be the site of a 19th-century coprolite mine.

==National Trust property==

Anglesey Abbey, officially known as Anglesey Abbey, Gardens and Lode Mill, was until 2020 open to the public all year round. There is an admission charge, with National Trust members having a free entry. In 2018/19 there were 382,235 visitors to Anglesey Abbey, making it the eleventh most visited National Trust property open at a charge. In 1978 the mill was restored to working order by the Cambridgeshire Wind and Watermill Society and flour can be bought in the mill or the shop. A new visitor centre with a restaurant and shop was opened in 2008. Seasonal attractions include the winter lights festival, snowdrop and daffodil tours in spring, and summer outdoor cinema.

In March 2020 the property was closed to visitors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the gardens and park re-opening in June 2020.

Anglesey Abbey was featured in the National Trust&#x27;s 2020 &quot;Interim Report on the Connections between Colonialism and Properties now in the Care of the National Trust, Including Links with Historic Slavery&quot; since Samuel Shepheard, who bought the property in 1739 but did not live there or make any additions to it, had been one of the 24 directors of the East India Company from 1717 to 1721.

<doc id="632777" wikidata="Q4972265" url="?curid=632777" title="Broadmoor Hospital">
<text>Broadmoor Hospital is a high-security psychiatric hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire, England. 

It is the oldest of England&#x27;s three high-security psychiatric hospitals, the other two being Ashworth Hospital near Liverpool and Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire. The hospital&#x27;s catchment area consists of four National Health Service regions: London, Eastern, South East and South West. It is managed by the West London NHS Trust.

== History ==
The hospital was first known as the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. Completed in 1863, it was built to a design by Sir Joshua Jebb, an officer of the Corps of Royal Engineers, and covered within its secure perimeter.

The first patient was a female admitted for infanticide on 27 May 1863. Notes described her as being &#x27;feeble minded&#x27;. It has been suggested by an analysis of her records that she most likely had congenital syphilis. The first male patients arrived on 27 February 1864. The original building plan of five blocks (four for men and one for women) was completed in 1868. An additional male block was built in 1902.

Due to overcrowding at Broadmoor, an extending asylum branch was constructed at Rampton Secure Hospital and opened in 1912. Rampton was closed as a branch asylum at the end of 1919 and reopened as an institution for &quot;mental defectives&quot; rather than lunatics. During the First World War Broadmoor&#x27;s block 1 was also used as a Prisoner-of-war camp, called Crowthorne War Hospital, for mentally ill German soldiers.

After the escape in 1952 of John Straffen, who murdered a local child, the hospital set up an alarm system, which was activated to alert people in the vicinity, as well as the public including those in the surrounding towns of Sandhurst, Wokingham, Bracknell, Camberley and Bagshot, when any potentially dangerous patient escapes. It was based on Second World War air raid sirens, and a two-tone alarm sounded across the whole area in the event of an escape. Until 2018, it was tested every Monday morning at 10 am for two minutes, after which a single tone &#x27;all-clear&#x27; was sounded for a further two minutes. All schools in the area were required to keep procedures designed to ensure that in the event of a Broadmoor escape no child was ever out of the direct supervision of a member of staff. Sirens were located at Sandhurst School, Wellington College, Bracknell Forest Council depot and other sites until they were decommissioned upon the opening of the hospital&#x27;s new site.

Following the Peter Fallon QC inquiry into Ashworth Special Hospital, which reported in 1999, and which found serious concerns about security and abuses resulting from poor management, it was decided to review the security at all three of the special hospitals in England. Until this time each was responsible for maintaining its own security policies. This review was made the personal responsibility of Sir Alan Langlands, who at the time was chief executive of the NHS England. The report that came out of the review initiated a new partnership whereby the Department of Health sets out a policy of safety, and security directions, that all three special hospitals must adhere to.

In 2003, the Commission for Healthcare Improvement declared the Victorian buildings at Broadmoor Hospital &#x27;unfit for purpose&#x27;.

In 2015 the Care Quality Commission gave the hospital an Inadequate rating. In 2018 the hospital was rated as Good overall by the Care Quality Commission.

==Therapies==
Broadmoor uses both psychiatric medication and psychotherapy, as well as occupational therapy. One of the therapies available is the arts, and patients are encouraged to participate in the Koestler Awards Scheme. One of the longest-detained patients at Broadmoor is Albert Haines, who set a legal precedent in 2011 when his mental health tribunal hearing was allowed to be fully public; he argued there that he had never been given the type of counselling he had always sought, and the panel urged the clinicians to work more collaboratively and clearly towards his psychiatric rehabilitation.

==Nature of the facility==
Because of its high walls and other visible security features as well as the news reporting it has received in the past, the hospital is often assumed to be a prison by members of the public. Many of its patients are sent to it via the criminal justice system, and its original design brief incorporated an essence of addressing criminality in addition to mental illness. However, the layout inside and the daily routine are intended to assist the therapy practised there rather than to be run as a prison. Nearly all staff are members of the Prison Officers&#x27; Association, as opposed to other health service unions such as UNISON and the Royal College of Nursing.

== Governance ==

===Historical governance===
The first medical superintendent was John Meyer. His assistant, William Orange, succeeded him. Orange established &quot;a management style that was greatly admired&quot;. He also advised the Home Office on how to approach criminal insanity. Orange was in charge from 1870 to 1886.

From its opening, until 1948, Broadmoor was managed by a council of supervision, appointed by and reporting to the Home Secretary. Thereafter, the Criminal Justice Act 1948 transferred ownership of the hospital to the Department of Health (and the newly formed NHS) and oversight to the Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency established under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913. It also renamed the hospital Broadmoor Institution. The hospital remained under direct control of the Department of Health – a situation that reportedly &quot;combined notional central control with actual neglect&quot; – until the establishment of the Special Hospitals Service Authority in 1989, with Charles Kaye as its first chief executive.

Alan Franey ran the hospital from 1989 to 1997, having been recommended for the post by his friend Jimmy Savile. His leadership was undermined by persistent rumours of sexual impropriety on the hospital grounds. Allegedly, he ignored at least three sexual assaults that he had been informed about.

The Special Hospitals Service Authority was abolished in 1996, being replaced by individual special health authorities in each of the high-security hospitals. The Broadmoor Hospital Authority was itself dissolved on 31 March 2001.

===Current governance===
On 1 April 2001, West London Mental Health (NHS) Trust took over the responsibility for the hospital. The trust reports to the NHS Executive through NHS England London. The former director, who then became the CEO of the trust, quit in 2009 after Healthcare Commission/Care Quality Commission findings of serious failures to ensure patient safety at Broadmoor. In 2014 the director of specialist and forensic services resigned (and was employed elsewhere in the NHS) just prior to the conclusions of an investigation into a bullying culture. The next permanent CEO retired in 2015 in the wake of poor Care Quality Commission findings and other problems in the Trust.

A new head of security was appointed in March 2013, John Hourihan, who had thirty years&#x27; experience at Scotland Yard and had worked as a bodyguard for members of the royal family.

Meanwhile, the trust allowed ITV to film a two-part documentary within Broadmoor in 2014. Press releases stated that on average there are four &#x27;assaults&#x27; per week on staff. Psychiatrist Amlan Basu, clinical director of Broadmoor since March 2014, promoted the documentary but then decided to leave the NHS in 2015 amidst funding and staffing problems, despite the trust having just highlighted investment in his skills through its &#x27;prestigious initiative to improve the quality of patient care in the NHS.&#x27;

== Buildings ==
Much of Broadmoor&#x27;s architecture is still Victorian, including the gatehouse, which has a clock tower.

Following long-standing reports that the old buildings were unfit for purpose (for therapy or safety), planning permission was granted in 2012 for a £242 million redevelopment, involving a new unit comprising 10 wards to adjoin the existing 6 wards of the modern Paddock Unit, resulting in total bed numbers of 234. Building company Kier reported in 2013 a sum of £115 million for the new unit of 162 beds, ready to accept patients by the start of 2017, and £43 million for a separate new medium secure unit for men nearby.

A new unit called the Paddock Centre had already opened on 12 December 2005, to contain and treat patients classed as having a &#x27;dangerous severe personality disorder&#x27; (DSPD). This was a new and much debated category invented on behalf of the UK government, based on an individual being considered a &#x27;Grave and Immediate Danger&#x27; to the general public, and meeting some combination of criteria for personality disorders and/or high scores on the Hare Psychopathy Check list – Revised.

The Paddock Centre was designed to eventually house 72 patients, but never opened more than four of its six 12-bedded wards. The Department of Health and Ministry of Justice National Personality Disorder Strategy published in October 2011 concluded that the resources invested in the DSPD programme should instead be used in prison based treatment programmes and the DSPD service at Broadmoor was required to close by 31 March 2012.

The trust took possession of the first phase of the new buildings, with 16 wards and 234 beds, in May 2019.

==Misconduct by staff==

===Abuse===

From at least 1968 the television presenter and disc jockey Jimmy Savile undertook voluntary work at the hospital and was allocated his own room, supported by Broadmoor CEO Pat McGrath, who thought it would be good publicity.

In August 1988, following a recommendation by Cliff Graham, the senior civil servant in charge of mental health at the DHSS, Savile was appointed by the department&#x27;s health minister Edwina Currie to chair an interim task force overseeing the management of the hospital following the suspension of its board. Currie privately supported Savile&#x27;s attempts to &#x27;blackmail&#x27; the Prison Officers&#x27; Association and publicly declared her &#x27;full confidence&#x27; in him.

After an ITV1 documentary &quot;Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile&quot; in October 2012, allegations of sexual abuse by Savile were made or re-made by former patients and staff. The civil servant who first proposed Savile&#x27;s appointment to the task force at Broadmoor, Brian McGinnis, who ran the mental health division of the DHSS in 1987 before Cliff Graham, has since been investigated by police and prevented from working with children.

A Department of Health investigation led by former barrister Kate Lampard into Savile&#x27;s activities at Broadmoor and other hospitals and facilities in England, with Bill Kirkup leading the Broadmoor aspects, reported in 2014 that Savile had use of a personal set of keys to Broadmoor from 1968 to 2004 (not formally revoked until 2009), with full unsupervised access to some wards. Eleven allegations of sexual abuse were known; this is thought to be a substantial under-estimate, due to how psychiatric patients in particular were disbelieved or put off from coming forward. In five cases the identity of the alleged victim could not be traced, but of the other six it was concluded they had all been abused by Savile, repeatedly in the case of two patients.

The investigation also concluded that &#x27;the institutional culture in Broadmoor was previously inappropriately tolerant of staff–patient sexual relationships,&#x27; and that when there were female patients they were required to undress and bathe in front of staff and sometimes visitors. A &#x27;shocking&#x27; failure to ensure a safe or therapeutic environment for female patients had already been revealed in a 2002 inquiry prior to Broadmoor becoming male-only.

In 2010 a female charge nurse received a suspended prison sentence for engaging in sexual activity with a patient at the hospital.

===Violating patient confidentiality===
Journalists invading the privacy of patients or reporting false information about them have been the subject of dozens of complaints from Broadmoor. Healthcare assistant Robert Neave took payments from &quot;The Sun&quot; for several years to provide them with information, including copies of psychiatric reports; this was subsequently investigated by Operation Elveden. Mental health nurse Kenneth Hall was imprisoned in June 2015 for having repeatedly sold stories to the tabloids based on stolen medical notes and fabricated documents.

<doc id="632778" wikidata="Q1094087" url="?curid=632778" title="Chester (district)">
<text>Chester was a non-metropolitan local government district of Cheshire, England, from 1974 to 2009. It had the status of a city and a borough, and the local authority was called Chester City Council.

Apart from Chester itself, which was the principal settlement, the district covered a large rural area. Other settlements included Malpas and Tarvin.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of the existing city and county borough of Chester with the Chester Rural District and Tarvin Rural District. It was a non-metropolitan district, with county-level services for the area provided by Cheshire County Council.

The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor. The city status which had previously attached to the old county borough of Chester was extended to cover the enlarged district on 28 May 1974, a few weeks after the changes came into effect, allowing the council to call itself Chester City Council.

In 2006 the Department for Communities and Local Government considered reorganising Cheshire&#x27;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The decision to merge Vale Royal with the districts of Chester and Ellesmere Port and Neston to create a single unitary authority was announced on 25 July 2007, following a consultation period in which a proposal to create a single Cheshire unitary authority was rejected.

The Chester district was abolished on 31 March 2009, with the area becoming part of the new unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester from 1 April 2009. Chester&#x27;s city charter is retained through the appointment of charter trustees.

===Lord mayoralty and shrievalty===
The office of mayor of Chester was continued in 1974 by virtue of the charter, the title being borne by the chairman of the council. The mayor of Chester had, since at least 1528, enjoyed the additional honorific title of &quot;Admiral of the Dee&quot;. The title was confirmed by letters patent dated 15 May 1974. In 1992, as part of celebrations of the fortieth anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II, the mayor&#x27;s title was raised to Lord Mayor of Chester by letters patent dated 10 March 1992.

Under the charter granted in 1974 the new council was permitted to continue to appoint any traditional &quot;officers of dignity&quot; that the predecessor city and county borough had been entitled to appoint. Accordingly, in June 1974 it was decided to continue the office of Sheriff of Chester that dated from the early twelfth century.

The offices of lord mayor and sheriff of Chester were held by serving councillors, and there was an annual rotation of the posts between the three main parties.

===Coat of arms===
In 1977 the city council was regranted a &quot;differenced&quot; version of the sixteenth century arms of the predecessor Corporation of the City and County Borough of Chester. The historic arms of Chester was based on the Royal Arms of England (three golden lions on a red shield) combined with three gold wheatsheaves on blue of the Earldom of Chester. A gold border bearing acorns was added to the arms to represent the rural areas added in 1974. The crest of the corporation was a depiction of the city sword. To this was added two branches of oak for the two rural districts combined with the county borough. The supporters of the city arms were a gold lion representing England and a white wolf for Hugh Lupus, 1st Earl of Chester. In 1977 they were altered slightly by the addition of red castles hanging about their necks. The Latin motto was &quot;Antiqui Colant Antiquum Dierum&quot; or &quot;Let the ancients worship the ancient of days&quot;.

==Civil parishes==
Chester district contained a comparatively large number of civil parishes. There were 46 parish councils operating in the district in 2008, some of which were grouped parish councils covering more than one civil parish. Some smaller parishes were not covered any parish council, leaving parish level representation to be administered through a parish meeting.

The main built-up part of Chester was an unparished area, corresponding to the area of the former county borough. One anomaly was that there was a small civil parish just covering the area around Chester Castle, which was surrounded by the unparished area. This was the civil parish of Chester Castle, which had not been part of the pre-1974 Chester County Borough, but had been a detached part of the Chester Rural District.

==Political control==
The city of Chester had been a county borough, independent from any county council, from 1889 to 1974. The first elections to the enlarged district created under the Local Government Act 1972 were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was held by the following parties:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council were:

==Premises==

The council had its main offices at The Forum on Northgate Street, Chester, being offices above a shopping centre. The offices at The Forum had been opened on 4 April 1973 for the old city council when it was a county borough, but in anticipation of the reforms due to come into effect in 1974. The offices immediately adjoined Chester Town Hall, where council and committee meetings were held.

===2006 Election===
The Conservative Party gained 5 seats in Lache, Newton St. Michael&#x27;s, Handbridge, Elton and Upton Grange. Labour lost three seats to the Conservatives, and avoided losing Boughton and City to the Conservatives, and College to the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats lost two seats to the Conservatives, and only avoided losing a safe seat, Vicars Cross, to the Conservatives. In addition, a Liberal Democrat Councillor (Jeff Clarke, Waverton) defected to the Conservatives. The Conservatives also won a by-election in Autumn 2006, taking another seat from the Liberal Democrats.

===2007 Election===
The Conservative party gained 7 seats in Lache, Newton Brook, Huntington, Tattenhall, Upton Grange, Kelsall and Boughton Heath. They also regained Christleton after the seat had been vacant for four months. The Liberal Democrats were defeated in five seats, Labour in one, and one long-serving Independent (Doug Haynes, Tattenhall) was beaten. Labour were beaten into fourth place in one ward (Malpas) by the English Democrats. The Liberal Democrats narrowly avoided finishing in fourth place in Blacon Hall and Blacon Lodge. Labour held College by just 7 votes, with the Liberal Democrats in second place.

===2008 Election===
The 2008 elections were cancelled due to local government re-organisation. Elections to a shadow Cheshire West and Chester (CWC) unitary authority were instead held. This meant that councillors elected in 2004 served for an additional year before the city council was disbanded. Therefore, the Conservatives remained the governing party until April 2009, when the new CWC Council replaced the city council.

<text>The Snowy River is a major river in south-eastern Australia. It originates on the slopes of Mount Kosciuszko, Australia&#x27;s highest mainland peak, draining the eastern slopes of the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales, before flowing through the Alpine National Park and the Snowy River National Park in Victoria and emptying into Bass Strait.

While the river&#x27;s course and surroundings have remained almost entirely unchanged, the majority of it being protected by the Snowy River National Park, its flow was drastically reduced in the mid 20th century, to less than 1% (as measured at Jindabyne), after the construction of four large dams (Guthega, Island Bend, Eucumbene, and Jindabyne) and many smaller diversion structures in its headwaters in New South Wales, as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.

The river has been immortalised in cultural folklore through the poem &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;, written by Banjo Paterson in 1890, which formed the basis of many subsequent works in film, TV and music theatre.

==Geography==
 
The main headwaters of the Snowy River, which include the Eucumbene, Gungarlin and Thredbo Rivers and many smaller alpine watercourses, are predominantly located in Kosciuszko National Park and meet near Jindabyne. From this point the river winds southwards through inaccessible country, comprising private lands and the Snowy River National Park, eventually reaching the sea in the Snowy Inlet, at Marlo, near Orbost.

In New South Wales, the river runs through the Snowy Monaro Regional Council. The tributaries of the Snowy River below Jindabyne include: the Mowamba, Wullwye Creek, Maclaughlin, Delegate, Jacobs, Pinch, Suggan Buggan, Deddick, Buchan, Rodger and Brodribb rivers. At a pinch point named Hutchings pass, water flows uphill.

In 1986, Jennings and Mabbutt mapped four geomorphic classes in the Snowy River Basin; (i) Australian Alps; (ii) the Monaro Tablelands; (iii) the East Victorian Uplands and (iv) the Gippsland Plains. Each class is physically distinct from one another.

===Rainfall===
The general distribution of rainfall over the Snowy River drainage basin (catchment) is controlled by orographic effects. There is a strong rainfall gradient across the basin.

The highest average annual rainfall is recorded in the higher alpine reaches of the Snowy Catchment, with recorded in areas above . The lowest average rainfall is recorded in the rain shadow affected north eastern catchment on the Monaro Plains around Dalgety, with average rain below . The lower eastern sub-catchments are more strongly influenced by coastal rainfall patterns. For example, peak rainfall in the Delegate catchment is strongly influenced by east coast lows, rather than the alpine dominated precipitation patterns in the upper Snowy River catchment. These local variations in rainfall result in distinctly different hydrology in the rivers across the Snowy River catchment.

===Hydrology===
The snow melt derived rivers in the Snowy Mountains typically have the lowest average stream flow in the months from November to June, with October having the largest monthly flows of the year, &quot;e.g.&quot;, mean monthly flow for October at Dalgety was prior to the Snowy Scheme. The large flows in September and October are derived from snowmelt and hydrologically it is one of the key aspects that defines these mountain waterways. Typically, Australian rivers can be defined as having highly variable river flows, with frequent zero flows even in humid areas due to the extreme age of soils and consequent extremely high water absorption to absorb minimal phosphorus via proteoid and similar root types. The mixed snow melt-rainfall rivers of the Snowy Mountains can be defined by strong seasonal patterns and remain permanent throughout the year, with no record of zero flow ever observed in the Lower Snowy. Prolonged base flows over the summer months are another feature of these types of rivers, driven by snowmelt derived groundwater.

In the lower reaches of the Snowy River catchment, the larger tributaries have a distinctly different flow regime to the snow melt rivers of the Alps. These tributaries are typically dominated by the winter rainfall and often have peak monthly flows a few months earlier than the snow melt tributaries. The peak monthly flows for these lower Snowy River tributaries occur in June through July. Additionally, the flow regime in the lower tributaries is far more variable and unpredictable.

===Waterfalls===
The Snowy River below Jindabyne Dam contains four major waterfalls; Stone Bridge Falls, Corrowong Falls, Snowy Falls and Pinch Falls. Potentially, many of these waterfalls act as barriers for the large scale movement of aquatic species in the main stem of the Snowy River. The flows required to drown out the largest barrier, Snowy Falls, is potentially larger than the environmental water releases to the river via Jindabyne Dam.

==Parklands and protected areas==
Around 70–80% of the Snowy River&#x27;s length is protected by national parks, these include, from upstream to downstream:
*Kosciuszko National Park — New South Wales
*Alpine National Park — Victoria
*Snowy River National Park — Victoria

==River ecology==
The aquatic flora and fauna of the snowy mountain snow melt rivers have evolved with the predictable seasonal hydrological snow melt peaks and constant summer base flow conditions. Many of these flora and fauna are coldwater specialists.

===River habitat===
The instream habitat of the Snowy River below Jindabyne has changed. Many of the in-stream features of a large upland river are not evident today. The substrate was previously typified by a clean cobble stone substrate. Today, the river channel has contracted and the substrate has a heavy cover of sediment, overlying much of the cobble stone riverbed.

The bushfires of 2002–03, added to this problem as large amounts of sediment and organic matter were deposited in the river via tributary inflows. This input of sediment lead to the substrate becoming finer. This pattern of increased silt in the pools of rivers and streams has been observed across the Snowy Mountains following the bushfires. These bushfires are likely to have a long lasting influence on these waterways.

Larger events are required to start to improve the condition of the river bed. Events of per day will start to move the unconsolidated fine particles of the riverbed. Events between per day are important for conditioning the riffle habitats (&quot;i.e.&quot;, a type of flowing water habitat).

The current poor condition of the river bed is one of the key factors inhibiting the aquatic fauna typical in a snow melt river.

===Water quality===
The mountain streams and rivers are typically low in nutrients and electrical conductivity. Conductivity is generally below 50 μS/cm.

Large dams can essentially influence downstream water quality via two key mechanisms, either by poor water quality released from the waters of the dam itself and reduced mixing of the river water column attributable to lower water velocities leading to anoxic conditions at the bottom of deep river pools.

====Influence of Jindabyne Dam on water quality====
Possibly the main influence on downstream water quality from Jindabyne Dam, is the influence on water temperature. Unlike many other dams where coldwater pollution is a concern, where water is released from the below the thermocline in the reservoir (i.e. the bottom water of the lake), the water is released from the surface waters of lake Jindabyne. The water temperature of the Snowy River downstream can reach temperatures of in summer.

The Snowy River is on average 4 °C (7 °F) warmer than the surrounding unregulated snow melt rivers, with a peak difference of up to 8 °C (14 °F). The water temperature in spring appears to be the greatly warmer than the surrounding snow melt rivers.

====Thermal stratification====
Thermal stratification in the river reaches below Jindabyne is typically restricted to a few of the larger or deeper pools. In general thermal stratification is spatially restricted to the pools that are typically greater than deep. Pools shallower than have not displayed any thermal stratification.

Stratification can occur between October and March, but typically does not persist for very long in the Snowy River in the Jindabyne Gorge. Breakdown of thermal stratification is frequently driven by the cooling overnight air temperature. This region experiences a very large temperature range between day and night (i.e. diurnal temperature range).

===Algae===
Algae is present in the water column and on the bed of the Snowy River. The water column algae is called phytoplankton, whereas the riverbed algae is defined as periphyton (attached algae).

====Riverbed algae====
Much of the bed of the Snowy River below Jindabyne contains high levels of attached algae. These taxa are typically filamentous algae. In the snowy mountains rivers unaffected by water diversions, large stands of filamentous algae are uncommon.

====Water column algae====
During 2008–09, the river pools of Jindabyne Gorge and the Dalgety uplands were typically dominated by blue green algae. Two blue green algae &quot;Aphanotheca&quot; spp. and &quot;Aphanocaspa&quot; spp. comprise about 25% of the total abundance. However, these abundances are still under the guidelines and its unclear if this is solely related to river regulation, but also reflects other catchment inputs.

The composition of algae in the free flowing snow melt rivers are typically defined by diatoms. Over 58% of taxa are diatoms, with &quot;Fragilaria&quot; spp. being the most numerically abundant taxa.

===Water bugs===
The water bugs in the Snowy River differ from the bugs of the snowmelt rivers. Dams have been shown to have an adverse impact on the water bugs of rivers.

Caenid mayflies (riffles) and oligochaete worms (pool edges) are generally typical of the upland regulated Snowy River. Other studies have also found greater densities of Caenidae mayflies in regulated rivers compared to unregulated rivers. Reduced high flows and constant low flows in the upper Snowy River are likely to have favoured high densities of worms through the buildup of silt and organic matter in the pools. Nichols et al. (2006) and Petts et al. (1993) also found greater densities of segmented worms associated with soft sediments and coarse organic debris in response to river regulation. Chironomids were also numerically dominant in riffles sampled in the regulated Snowy River. This response has been found in many other studies of regulated rivers and has been attributed to an increase of periphytic growth in riffles that increased overall habitat area and food availability.
Conoesucidae caddisflies (riffles), larval and adult elmids (riffles) and Oniscigastridae (pool edges) distinguished the snow melt rivers from regulated Snowy River. Marchant and Hehir (2002) reported that AUSRIVAS models (&gt;50% probability) predicted Conoesucidae and elmids to be present in the upper Snowy River, but these taxa were not found in their study. The greater density of these taxa in snowmelt rivers compared the Snowy River is consistent with river regulation.

Marchant and Hehir attribute the absence of these taxa to dams acting as a barrier to drift and limiting recolonisation of these taxa and not to flow regulation. The upper Snowy River sites are all below the confluence of the Mowamba River which provides a pathway for recolonisation of the Snowy River. Therefore, the reduced flow and altered flow regime is likely to be the primary cause of reduced densities of these taxa in the upper Snowy River rather than the barrier effects of Jindabyne Dam. There is little information on the responses of Oniscigastridae to reduced flows and altered flow regimes, but it is probable that an elevated temperature regime combined with lack of suitable sandy edge habitat has reduced their densities in the Snowy River.

===Fish===
The fish assemblage of the Snowy River below Jindabyne are clearly divided into two components. This division is based on that which occurred in the upper catchment (above Snowy Falls) and that in the lower catchment (below Snowy Falls). 
The major differences between the two zones were the low abundance or absence of diadromous migratory fish (except eels) and the greater abundance of short-finned eel and trout in the upper catchment, and the greater abundance of Australian smelt, congolli and long-finned eel below Snowy Falls. These upper and lower Snowy River zone differences were greater than the differences between un-regulated tributary streams and the highly regulated main channel of the Snowy River within either zone. In the upper catchment, river blackfish, brown trout and short-finned eel were more abundant in un-regulated tributaries, whilst long-finned eel and goldfish were more abundant in the regulated upper part of the Snowy River. In the lower zone, eastern gambusia, long-finned eel, Australian smelt, short-finned eel and congolli were all more abundant in Snowy River while common galaxias and short-headed lamprey were more abundant at tributaries.

==Flow thresholds below Jindabyne==
River scientists are currently undertaking studies to determine the flow thresholds for a range of riverine processes. Some preliminary flow thresholds that have been developed include:

Further defining of ecological flow thresholds is currently in progress via modelling, field based studies, and flow trials. See Snowy Flow Response Monitoring and Modelling.

==History of water management==
===Early history===
The Snowy River was initially utilised sustainably as a food and water resource by Indigenous Australians for around 30,000–40,000 years prior to European settlement. Evidence of human occupation at Cloggs Cave, near the Snowy River, near Buchan, was dated at up to 17,000 years. Despite the cold climate in the river&#x27;s higher reaches, the Ngarigo nation held territory around the Australian Alps and the Snowy Mountains in modern-day New South Wales. As the river flowed southwards into modern day Victoria, it flowed in the Gunai nation&#x27;s territory, particularly, the Krauatungalung clan&#x27;s territory.

The first use of the Snowy River, for the extraction of energy, was by a water-powered flour mill, fed from a low weir across the river at Jindabyne. It was constructed by Stewart Ryrie, Junior, in 1847, and operated until around 1889.

===1950–1990s reduced water flow===

The Snowy River originally had a huge, often destructive flow during the spring snow-melt which flowed directly into the sea. In the 1950s and 1960s, as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a network of four dams (i.e. Guthega, Island Bend, Eucumebene and Jindabyne) and many smaller water diversion structures were built to collect and divert 99% (as measured at Jindabyne) of the Snowy River&#x27;s flow through the mountains, to provide more water to the Murray and Murrumbidgee River agricultural basins for irrigation. Several hydro-electric power stations were also constructed to generate electricity. While there was initial public opposition to the diversion of the river&#x27;s water during the 1950s and &#x27;60s, it was largely ignored as the scheme provided agriculture with more water. It generated a large number of jobs in construction initially, then in agriculture and logistics, and added permanent and reliable, on-demand electricity generation to two states.

===1990s–2000: Increased awareness===
By the 1990s, the reduced flows in the Snowy River became a major environmental concern in Victoria, New South Wales and across Australia. After the scheme was built downstream flows were insufficient to keep the channel clear of vegetation or move sediment in the stream bed. Salt water intrusion extended seven to ten kilometres up the estuary and outdoor recreational activities were curtailed along the lower reaches of the river.

This period of increased awareness of the impacts of water diversions lead to the Snowy Water Inquiry, which looked at options to improve the health of the Snowy River. The key outcomes of the Snowy Water Inquiry was an initial agreement to increase environmental water releases to the Snowy River below Jindabyne by 15% and the Snowy Montane Rivers.

These series of staged flow targets (up to 28% of mean annual natural discharge) were set for the Snowy River below Jindabyne, with these dependent on water savings in the Murray and Murrumbidgee River catchments. The targets included 15% by 2009 and 21% by 2012.

===2002–2006: Environmental water releases from the Mowamba River in a low allocation period===
From 28 August 2002 until January 2006, the first stage of environmental water was released to the Snowy River via the Mowamba River. The Mowamba River aqueduct was &quot;turned out&quot;, preventing water being diverted to Jindabyne Dam. The releases from the Mowamba River essentially doubled the daily discharge at Dalgety from about per day. Additionally, it provided a small snow melt signal, peaking in September. Only a small percentage of the Mowamba River catchment is covered by snow in winter, compared to some of the upper catchments in the Snowy River catchment. Additionally, the release increased daily river flow variability, between per day, and the timing of flows was in keeping with natural events across the catchment. These small discharges saw a 20% increase in wetted habitat and a doubling of running water habitat (i.e. riffles) in the upper reaches of the Snowy River in the Dalgety Uplands, whereas the rest of the river saw a decline in discharge due to the prevailing drought.

This stage increased flows from 1% to approximately 4% of mean annual river discharge. Typically an annual release of per year.

===2006–2010: Environmental water releases from Jindabyne Dam in a low allocation period===
After the completion of capital works (i.e. multi-level offtake and the cone values) at Jindabyne Dam the environmental water releases were essentially released from Jindabyne Dam, rather than the Mowamba River. The second stage of environmental flow releases saw a very small increase in the median flow rate, but also a decline in daily flow variability compared to base flow compared to stage one.

Overall the annual volume released remained around 38GL year given the historical record drought.

===2010–2011: Environmental water releases in a higher allocation period===

During this stage the &quot;Water for Rivers&quot; were able to secure more water entitlements (i.e. up ) in the Western Rivers and the allocations increased as the drought broke in South Eastern Australia. Actual allocations are weather dependent, so in dry periods the allocation will be smaller than during wet periods. During this period the annual water availability jumped from about per annum. Although water is released all year, this period has seen two significant spring snow melt environmental water releases to the Snowy River.

In November 2010 the first spring snow melt release occurred. This small but important release had a peak discharge of per day, and was sufficient to start to scour the fines sediment from some sections of the bed of the Snowy.

In October 2011, with substantially greater water available a much larger spring snow melt release has occurred i.e. over 19 days. This second and substantially larger release with a peak discharge rate of per day over three days is expected to scour the bed of the river. This releases targeted much larger particles, up to the size of , as the bed of the river is heavily &quot;armoured&quot; and larger flows are required to move these particles to improve the instream habitat of the river. Once the armouring had been removed it is expected the fine sediment would be scoured within the river bed profile.

==Politics==
A political campaign began, which aimed to increase the water flow from 1% to 28% of its original flow from the dam at Jindabyne. An independent candidate from the East Gippsland district, Craig Ingram, was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1999 and re-elected in 2002 and 2006, on a platform to increase the flow of water in the Snowy River.

After Ingram was elected to office, he became instrumental in the three shareholding governments reaching agreement to return of up to 28% ANF of an environmental flow to the Snowy River which was an outcome of the corporatisation of the Snowy Scheme, swinging the Victorian Government to sign the legislation. Although the Victorian, NSW and Federal governments promised that corporatisation would not lead to privatisation, in November 2005 they announced their intention to sell Snowy Hydro through a public float. Community groups rallied to stop the sale of Snowy Hydro and by June 2006 the Australian Prime Minister withdrew the Commonwealth&#x27;s intention to sell Snowy Hydro.

==Cultural references==
The poem &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; was written by &#x27;Banjo&#x27; Paterson in 1890, which formed the basis of many subsequent works in film, TV and music theatre.

The natural environment surrounding the Snowy River formed part of the subject matter and setting for the &#x27;Banjo&#x27; Paterson poem &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;, first published in 1890. The Snowy River has also been immortalised in a 1920 &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; silent film, as well as in the better-known 1982 Fox film &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; and its 1988 Disney sequel film &quot;The Man from Snowy River II&quot; (U.S. title: &quot;&quot;Return to Snowy River&quot; – UK title: &quot;The Untamed&quot;&quot;), as well as in &quot;The Man from Snowy River (TV series)&quot; and &quot;The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular&quot;, all of which were based on the Banjo Paterson&#x27;s poem.

<text>A lament or lamentation is a passionate expression of grief, often in music, poetry, or song form. The grief is most often born of regret, or mourning. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner in which participants lament about something that they regret or someone that they have lost, and they are usually accompanied by wailing, moaning and/or crying. Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing, and examples exist across human cultures.

==History==

Many of the oldest and most lasting poems in human history have been laments. The Lament for Sumer and Ur dates back at least 4000 years to ancient Sumer, the world&#x27;s first urban civilization. Laments are present in both the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and laments continued to be sung in elegiacs accompanied by the aulos in classical and Hellenistic Greece. Elements of laments appear in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, in the Hindu Vedas, and in ancient Near Eastern religious texts. They are included in the Mesopotamian City Laments such as the Lament for Ur and the Jewish Tanakh, or Christian Old Testament.

In many oral traditions, both early and modern, the lament has been a genre usually performed by women: Batya Weinbaum made a case for the spontaneous lament of women chanters in the creation of the oral tradition that resulted in the &quot;Iliad&quot; The material of lament, the &quot;sound of trauma&quot; is as much an element in the Book of Job as in the genre of pastoral elegy, such as Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Adonais&quot; or Matthew Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Thyrsis&quot;.

The Book of Lamentations or &quot;Lamentations of Jeremiah&quot; figures in the Old Testament. The &quot;Lamentation of Christ&quot; (under many closely variant terms) is a common subject from the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; in art, showing Jesus&#x27; dead body being mourned after the Crucifixion. Jesus himself lamented over the prospective fall of Jerusalem as he and his disciples entered the city ahead of his passion.

A lament in the Book of Lamentations or in the Psalms, in particular in the Lament/Complaint Psalms of the Tanakh, may be looked at as &quot;a cry of need in a context of crisis when Israel lacks the resources to fend for itself&quot;. Another way of looking at it is all the more basic: laments simply being &quot;appeals for divine help in distress&quot;. These laments, too, often have a set format: an address to God, description of the suffering/anguish from which one seeks relief, a petition for help and deliverance, a curse towards one&#x27;s enemies, an expression of the belief of ones innocence or a confession of the lack thereof, a vow corresponding to an expected divine response, and lastly, a song of thanksgiving. Examples of a general format of this, both in the individual and communal laments, can be seen in Psalm 3 and Psalm 44 respectively.

The &quot;Lament of Edward II&quot;, if it is actually written by Edward II of England, is the sole surviving composition of his.

A heroine&#x27;s lament is a conventional fixture of baroque opera seria, accompanied usually by strings alone, in descending tetrachords. Because of their plangent cantabile melodic lines, evocatively free, non-strophic construction and adagio pace, operatic laments have remained vividly memorable soprano or mezzo-soprano arias even when separated from the emotional pathos of their operatic contexts. An early example is Ariadne&#x27;s &quot;Lasciatemi morire&quot;, which is the only survivor of Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s lost &quot;Arianna&quot;. Francesco Cavalli&#x27;s operas extended the &quot;lamento&quot; formula, in numerous exemplars, of which Ciro&#x27;s &quot;Negatemi respiri&quot; from &quot;Ciro&quot; is notable.

Other examples include Dido&#x27;s Lament (&quot;When I am laid in earth&quot;) (Henry Purcell, &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;), &quot;Lascia ch&#x27;io pianga&quot; (George Frideric Handel, &quot;Rinaldo&quot;), &quot;Caro mio ben&quot; (Tomaso or Giuseppe Giordani). The lament continued to represent a musico-dramatic high point. In the context of opera buffa, the Countess&#x27;s lament, &quot;Dove sono&quot;, comes as a surprise to the audience of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, and in Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Barber of Seville&quot;, Rosina&#x27;s plaintive words at her apparent abandonment are followed, not by the expected lament aria, but by a vivid orchestral interlude of storm music. The heroine&#x27;s lament remained a fixture in romantic opera, and the Marschallin&#x27;s monologue in act 1 of &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; can be understood as a penetrating psychological lament.

In modernity, discourses about melancholia and trauma take the functional place ritual laments hold in premodern societies. This entails a shift from a focus on community and convention to individuality and authenticity.

==Scottish laments==
The purely instrumental lament is a common form in piobaireachd music for the Scottish bagpipes. &quot;MacCrimmon&#x27;s Lament&quot; dates to the Jacobite uprising of 1745. The tune is held to have been written by Donald Ban MacCrimmon, piper to the MacLeods of Dunvegan, who supported the Hanoverians. It is said that Donald Ban, who was killed at Moy in 1746, had an intimation that he would not return.

A well-known Gaelic lullaby is &quot;Griogal Cridhe&quot; (&quot;Beloved Gregor&quot;). It was composed in 1570 after the execution of Gregor MacGregor by the Campbells. The grief-stricken widow, Marion Campbell, describes what happened as she sings to her child.

&quot;&quot; (&quot;Lament for the Children&quot;) is a pìobaireachd composed by Padruig Mór MacCrimmon in the early 1650s. It is generally held to be based on the loss of seven of MacCrimmon&#x27;s eight sons within a year to smallpox, possibly brought to Skye by a Spanish trading vessel. Poet and writer Angus Peter Campbell, quoting poet Sorley MacLean, has called it &quot;one of the great artistic glories of all Europe&quot;. Author Bridget MacKenzie, in &quot;Piping Traditions of Argyll&quot;, suggests that it refers to the slaughter of the MacLeod&#x27;s fighting Cromwell&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Worcester. It may have been inspired by both.

Other Scottish laments from outside of the piobaireachd tradition include &quot;Lowlands Away&quot;, &quot;MacPherson&#x27;s Rant&quot;, and &quot;Hector the Hero&quot;.

==Musical form==
There is a short, free musical form appearing in the Baroque and then again in the Romantic periods, called lament. It is typically a set of harmonic variations in homophonic texture, wherein the bass (Lament bass) descends through a tetrachord, usually one suggesting a minor mode.

<text>This page discusses the rivers and hydrography of the state of New South Wales, Australia.

The principal topographic feature of New South Wales is the series of low highlands and plateaus called the Great Dividing Range, which extend from north to south roughly parallel to the coast of the Coral and Tasman seas of the South Pacific Ocean.

The two main categories of rivers in New South Wales, are those that rise in the Great Dividing Range and flow eastwards to the sea, the Coastal NSW Rivers; and those that rise on the other side of the crest of the range and flow westward, the Inland NSW Rivers. Most of the inland rivers eventually combine into the Murray-Darling network of rivers, which drains to the sea in South Australia.

==Major rivers==
The following rivers are the longest river systems, by length.
== Coastal rivers ==
Due to the relatively close proximity of the Great Dividing Range to the eastern coast of New South Wales, in general, the coastal rivers are short, navigable only in their lowest reaches, if at all, and subject to flooding in periods of high rainfall. The inland rivers have little water, are also subject to flooding, and their limited resources are extensively used for irrigation in the more arid inland agricultural districts of the State. On all of the significant inland rivers, large dams have been constructed to regulate the water flow, to facilitate irrigation, and in some cases, to generate hydro-power.

For administrative purposes, the rivers are generally grouped into four major catchments defined by their drainage basin, and then a series of sub-catchments. The following is a list of the coastal rivers in New South Wales, in order from north to south, grouped according to catchment and sub-catchments, from mouth to upper reaches, organised by tributary:

== Inland-flowing rivers ==
The inland-flowing rivers in New South Wales can be considered in two groups. In the northern half of the state, a series of rivers rise on the western side of the Great Dividing Range. These rivers flow west and northwest and eventually combine into the Barwon, which becomes the Darling River further west near Bourke. The waters of the Darling River then flow south through the arid far west of NSW.

The second group of inland-flowing rivers in NSW rise in the southern part of the state, sourced predominantly from the western and southern slopes of the Snowy Mountains and the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, and combine directly with the Murray River, which forms the southern border of NSW with Victoria.

The two groups converge at Wentworth in the far south-west corner of the state, where the Murray River crosses the New South Wales/Victorian/South Australia border, east of Paringa in South Australia.

<doc id="632786" wikidata="Q12791246" url="?curid=632786" title="Insulin-like growth factor 1">
<text>Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), also called somatomedin C, is a hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin which plays an important role in childhood growth, and has anabolic effects in adults. In the 1950s IGF-1 was called &quot;sulfation factor&quot; because it stimulated sulfation of cartilage in vitro, and in the 1970s due to its effects it was termed &quot;nonsuppressible insulin-like activity&quot; (NSILA).

IGF-1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;IGF1&quot; gene. IGF-1 consists of 70 amino acids in a single chain with three intramolecular disulfide bridges. IGF-1 has a molecular weight of 7,649 daltons. In dogs, an ancient mutation in IGF1 is the primary cause of the toy phenotype.

IGF-1 is produced primarily by the liver. Production is stimulated by growth hormone (GH). Most of IGF-1 is bound to one of 6 binding proteins (IGF-BP). IGFBP-1 is regulated by insulin. IGF-1 is produced throughout life; the highest rates of IGF-1 production occur during the pubertal growth spurt. The lowest levels occur in infancy and old age.

Low IGF-1 levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, while high IGF-1 levels are associated with cancer. Mid-range IGF-1 levels are associated with the lowest mortality.

A synthetic analog of IGF-1, mecasermin, is used for the treatment of growth failure in children with severe IGF-1 deficiency. Cyclic glycine-proline (cGP) is a metabolite of hormone insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). It has a cyclic structure, lipophilic nature, and is enzymatically stable which makes it a more favourable candidate for manipulating the binding-release process between IGF-1 and its binding protein, thereby normalising IGF-1 function.

== Synthesis and circulation ==

The polypeptide hormone IGF-1 is synthesized primarily in the liver upon stimulation by growth hormone (GH). It is a key mediator of anabolic activities in numerous tissues and cells, such as growth hormone-stimulated growth, metabolism and protein translation. Due to its participation in the GH-IGF-1 axis it contributes among other things to the maintenance of muscle strength, muscle mass, development of the skeleton and is a key factor in brain, eye and lung development during fetal development.

Studies have shown the importance of the GH-IGF-1 axis in directing development and growth, where mice with a IGF-1 deficiency had a reduced body- and tissue mass. Mice with an excessive expression of IGF-1 had an increased mass.

The levels of IGF-1 in the body vary throughout life, depending on age, where peaks of the hormone is generally observed during puberty and the postnatal period. After puberty, when entering the third decade of life, there is a rapid decrease in IGF-1 levels due to the actions of GH. Between the third and eight decade of life, the IGF-1 levels decrease gradually, but unrelated to functional decline. However, protein intake is proven to increase IGF-1 levels.

== Mechanism of action ==
IGF-1 is a primary mediator of the effects of growth hormone (GH). Growth hormone is made in the anterior pituitary gland, released into the bloodstream, and then stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1. IGF-1 then stimulates systemic body growth, and has growth-promoting effects on almost every cell in the body, especially skeletal muscle, cartilage, bone, liver, kidney, nerve, skin, hematopoietic, and lung cells. In addition to the insulin-like effects, IGF-1 can also regulate cellular DNA synthesis.

IGF-1 binds to at least two cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases: the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R), and the insulin receptor. Its primary action is mediated by binding to its specific receptor, IGF1R, which is present on the surface of many cell types in many tissues. Binding to the IGF1R initiates intracellular signaling. IGF-1 is one of the most potent natural activators of the Akt signaling pathway, a stimulator of cell growth and proliferation, and a potent inhibitor of programmed cell death. The IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor are two closely related members of a transmembrane tetrameric tyrosine kinase receptor family. They control vital brain functions, such as survival, growth, energy metabolism, longevity, neuroprotection and neuroregeneration.
=== Metabolic effects ===

As a major growth factor, IGF-1 is responsible for stimulating growth of all cell types, and causing significant metabolic effects. One important metabolic effect of IGF-1 is signaling cells that sufficient nutrients are available for them to undergo hypertrophy and cell division. Its effects also include inhibiting cell apoptosis and increasing the production of cellular proteins. IGF-1 receptors are ubiquitous, which allows for metabolic changes caused by IGF-1 to occur in all cell types. IGF-1&#x27;s metabolic effects are far-reaching and can coordinate protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism in a variety of different cell types. The regulation of IGF-1&#x27;s metabolic effects on target tissues is also coordinated with other hormones such as growth hormone and insulin.

=== The IGF system ===

IGF-1 is part of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system. This system consists of three ligands (insulin, IGF-1 and IGF-2), two tyrosine kinase receptors (insulin receptor and IGF-1R receptor) and six ligand binding proteins (IGFBP 1–6). Together they play an essential role in proliferation, survival, regulation of cell growth and affect almost every organ system in the body.

Similarly to IGF-1, IGF-2 is mainly produced in the liver and after it is released into circulation, it stimulates growth and cell proliferation. IGF-2 is thought to be a fetal growth factor, as it is essential for a normal embryonic development and is highly expressed in embryonic and neonatal tissues.

=== Variants ===
A splice variant of IGF-1 sharing an identical mature region, but with a different E domain is known as &quot;mechano-growth factor&quot; (MGF).

== Related disorders ==

=== Laron syndrome ===
=== Acromegaly ===

Acromegaly is a syndrome caused by the anterior pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone (GH). A number of disorders may increase the pituitary&#x27;s GH output, although most commonly it involves a tumor called pituitary adenoma, derived from a distinct type of cell (somatotrophs). It leads to anatomical changes and metabolic dysfunction caused by elevated GH and IGF-1 levels. 

High level of IGF-1 in acromegaly is related to an increased risk of some cancers, particularly colon cancer and thyroid cancer.

== Use as a diagnostic test ==

=== Growth hormone deficiency ===
IGF-1 levels can be analyzed and used by physicians as a screening test for growth hormone deficiency (GHD), acromegaly and gigantism. However, IGF-1 has been shown to be a bad diagnostic screening test for growth hormone deficiency.

The ratio of IGF-1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 has been shown to be a useful diagnostic test for GHD.

=== Liver fibrosis ===
Low serum IGF-1 levels have been suggested as a biomarker for predicting fibrosis, but not steatosis, in people with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.

== Causes of elevated IGF-1 levels ==
* Medical conditions:
** acromegaly (especially when GH is also high)
** delayed puberty
** pregnancy
** hyperthyroidism
** some rare tumors, such as carcinoids, secreting IGF-1
* Diet:
** High-protein diet
** consumption of dairy products (except for cheese)
** consumption of fish
* IGF-1 assay problems
Calorie restriction has been found to have no effect on IGF-1 levels.

== Causes of reduced IGF-1 levels ==

* Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, especially at advanced stages of steatohepatitis and fibrosis

== Health effects ==

=== Mortality ===

Both high and low levels of IGF‐1 increase mortality risk, with the mid‐range (120–160 ng/ml) being associated with the lowest mortality.

=== Cancer ===

Higher levels of IGF-1 are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, colon cancer and lung cancer. 

==== Dairy consumption ====

It has been suggested that consumption of IGF-1 in dairy products could increase cancer risk, particularly prostate cancer. However, significant levels of intact IGF-1 from oral consumption are not absorbed as they are digested by gastric enzymes. IGF-1 present in food is not expected to be active within the body in the way that IGF-1 is produced by the body itself.

The Food and Drug Administration has stated that IGF-I concentrations in milk are not significant when evaluated against concentrations of IGF-I endogenously produced in humans.

A 2018 review by the Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) concluded that there is &quot;insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions as to whether exposure to dietary IGF-1 is associated with an increased incidence of cancer in consumers&quot;. Certain dairy processes such as fermentation are known to significantly decrease IGF-1 concentrations. The British Dietetic Association has described the idea that milk promotes hormone related cancerous tumor growth as a myth, stating &quot;no link between dairy containing diets and risk of cancer or promoting cancer growth as a result of hormones&quot;.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===

Increased IGF-1 levels are associated with a 16% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 28% reduction of cardiovascular events. 

=== Diabetes ===
Low IGF-1 levels are shown to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. On the other hand, a high IGF-1 bioavailability in people with diabetes may delay or prevent diabetes-associated complications, as it improves impaired small blood vessel function.

IGF-1 has been characterized as an insulin sensitizer.

Low serum IGF‐1 levels can be considered an indicator of liver fibrosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

<doc id="632787" wikidata="Q2834810" url="?curid=632787" title="City of Bradford">
<text>Bradford (), also known as the City of Bradford, is a metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire, England. It is named after its largest settlement, Bradford, but covers a larger area which includes the towns and villages of Keighley, Shipley, Bingley, Ilkley, Haworth, Silsden, Queensbury, Thornton and Denholme. Bradford has a population of 528,155, making it the fourth-most populous metropolitan district and the ninth-most populous local authority district in England. It forms part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area conurbation which in 2011 had a population of 1,777,934, and the city is part of the Leeds-Bradford Larger Urban Zone (LUZ), which, with a population of 2,393,300, is the fourth largest in the United Kingdom after London, Birmingham and Manchester.

The city is situated on the edge of the Pennines, and is bounded to the east by the City of Leeds, the south by the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees and the south west by the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale. The Pendle borough of Lancashire lies to the west whilst the unitary authority of North Yorkshire lie to the north west and north east of the city. Bradford is the 4th largest metropolitan district in the country, and the contiguous urban area to the north which includes the towns of Shipley and Bingley is heavily populated. The spa town of Ilkley lies further north, whilst the town of Keighley lies to the west. Roughly two thirds of the district is rural, with an environment varying from moorlands in the north and west, to valleys and floodplains formed by the river systems that flow throughout the district. More than half of Bradford&#x27;s land is green open space, stretching over part of the Airedale and Wharfedale Valleys, across the hills and the Pennine moorland between. The Yorkshire Dales and the Peak District are both in close proximity.

The City of Bradford has architecture designated as being of special or historic importance, most of which were constructed with local stone, with 5,800 listed buildings and 59 conservation areas. The model village of Saltaire has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Central Bradford rose to prominence during the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture, particularly wool. The area&#x27;s access to a supply of coal, iron ore and soft water facilitated the growth of Bradford&#x27;s manufacturing base, which, as textile manufacture grew, led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment. However, Bradford has faced similar challenges to the rest of the post-industrial area of northern England, including deindustrialisation, housing problems, and economic deprivation. Wool and textiles still play an important part in the city&#x27;s economy, but today&#x27;s fastest-growing sectors include information technology, financial services, digital industries, environmental technologies, cultural industries, tourism and retail headquarters and distribution.

Bradford has experienced significant levels of immigration throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1840s Bradford&#x27;s population was significantly increased by migrants from Ireland, particularly rural County Mayo and County Sligo, and by 1851 around 18,000 people of Irish origin resided in the town, representing around 10% of the population, the largest proportion in Yorkshire. Around the same time there was also an influx of German Jewish migrants to the town, and by 1910 around 1,500 people of German origin resided in the city.
In the 1950s there was large scale immigration from South Asia and to a lesser extent from Poland. Bradford has the second highest proportion in England and Wales outside London, in terms of population (behind Birmingham) and in percentage (behind Slough, Leicester, Luton and Blackburn with Darwen). An estimated 140,149 people of South Asian origin reside in the city, representing around 26.83% of the city&#x27;s population. An estimated 352,317 of all White ethnic groups reside in the city which includes people of Polish and Irish origin, representing around 67.44% of the city&#x27;s population.

In 2025, Bradford will become the UK City of Culture having won the UK City of Culture designation on 31 May 2022.

==History==
Bradford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1847, covering the parishes of Bradford, Horton and Manningham. It became a county borough with the passing of the Local Government Act 1888. The County Borough of Bradford was granted city status by Letters Patent in 1897.

Bradford was expanded in 1882 to include Allerton, Bolton, Bowling, Heaton, Thornbury and Tyersall. In 1899 it was further expanded by adding North Bierley, Eccleshill, Idle, Thornton, Tong, and Wyke. Clayton was added in 1930.

The Brontë sisters, Emily, Anne, and Charlotte were born along with their brother Branwell at 74 Market Street in Thornton, now in Bradford, before moving to the parsonage at Haworth in the heart of West Yorkshire&#x27;s Brontë Country where they wrote a range of classics of English literature including &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

The city played an important part in the early history of the Labour Party. A mural on the back of the Priestley Centre For The Arts in Little Germany commemorates the centenary of the founding of the Independent Labour Party in Bradford in 1893.

The Bradford Pals were three First World War Pals battalions of Kitchener&#x27;s Army raised in the city. When the three battalions were taken over by the British Army they were officially named the 16th, 18th and 20th Battalions, The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own West Yorkshire Regiment.

On the morning of 1 July 1916, an estimated 1,394 young men from Bradford and District The Bradford Pals, the 16th and 18th Battalions of the Prince of Wales Own West Yorkshire Regiment left their trenches in Northern France to advance across No Man&#x27;s Land. It was the first hour of the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Of the estimated 1,394 men who left the trenches 1,094 were either killed or injured during the ill-fated attack on the village of Serre.

Other Bradford Battalions involved in the Battle of the Somme were 1st/6th Territorial Battalion of The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own West Yorkshire Regiment, based at Belle Vue barracks in Manningham and the 10th Battalion of The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own West Yorkshire Regiment. The 1st/6th Territorial Battalion of The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own West Yorkshire Regiment first saw action in 1915 at Neuve Chapelle before moving north to Yser Canal near Ypres.
The 10th Battalion The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own West Yorkshire Regiment was involved in the attack on Fricourt, the 10th West Yorks suffered the highest casualty rate of any battalion on the Somme on 1 July and perhaps the highest battalion casualty list for a single day during the entire war. Nearly 60% of the battalion&#x27;s casualties were deaths.

In 1919 the Diocese of Bradford was founded, the Church of Saint Peter was then elevated to cathedral status.

The current city boundaries date from 1 April 1974, when the County Borough of Bradford was merged with the borough of Keighley, the urban districts of Baildon, Bingley, Denholme, Ilkley, Shipley and Silsden, along with the Queensbury parts of Queensbury and Shelf Urban District and the parishes of Addingham, and Steeton with Eastburn from Skipton Rural District. Kildwick was part of Bradford at this time, but has since been moved into the Craven District (part of North Yorkshire).

The National Science and Media Museum (formerly the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television) was established in the city in 1983. One of the first cinema shows outside London took place on the site where the museum now stands, in a music hall known as the People&#x27;s Palace. Today, the National Science and Media Museum hosts the annual Widescreen Weekend film festival.

With a large influx of South Asian immigrants and the Bradford Council&#x27;s pursuit of a policy of multiculturalism in the 1980s, separatism between ethnic communities became an issue, an issue highlighted by Bradford headteacher Ray Honeyford. In 1989, a section of the Muslim community led a campaign against Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, and caught the attention of the international media by publicly burning a copy of the book. In July 2001, ethnic tensions led to rioting. The Ouseley Report, written shortly before the riots broke out, noted that Bradford had become deeply divided by segregated schooling, with communities deeply ignorant of each other, and there was widespread fear of crime and violence which West Yorkshire Police had insufficiently tackled for fear of being branded racist.

In one case, a Bradford man whose car was set on fire following his conversion complained to police, but the officer advised him to &quot;stop being a crusader and move to another place.&quot;

In response to the Ouseley Report, approximately £3 million was provided by the Home Office and the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund to regenerate the city. A further £2 billion was invested in regenerating the city centre, building a banqueting hall, new housing, and leisure facilities.
In December 2001, Saltaire was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This means that the government has a duty to protect the site. The buildings belonging to the model village are individually listed, with the highest level of protection given to the Congregational church (since 1972 known as the United Reformed Church) which is listed as Grade I. The village which includes Salts Mill (pictured right) has survived remarkably complete with Roberts Park on the north side of the river recently restored by Bradford Council.

In October 2007, Bradford was voted the greenest city in the United Kingdom. In the Sustainable Cities Index, compiled by Forum for the Future, the city was revealed to have the lowest environmental impact of any British city. In spite of its undeniably large role in the Industrial Revolution, Bradford&#x27;s rivers were not polluted beyond redemption, and the streams surrounding the city are now a haven of wildlife. The City of Bradford has areas of green space, and recycling schemes.

Bradford became the world&#x27;s first UNESCO City of Film in 2009. The designation recognises Bradford&#x27;s aim to use this history and the local popularity and accessibility of film as a major tool for regeneration, cultural development and social inclusion.

The cinema connections in the city (which is also the home of the National Science and Media Museum) are both historical and contemporary, with ongoing efforts to preserve, promote, and enrich the city&#x27;s heritage of film. Bradford has been a film location since the beginning of cinema, with its indigenous film industry being traced back to the years around the First World War. By then the residents of Bradford had already witnessed important contributions to cinema development, such as the invention of the Cieroscope in Manningham in 1896.

In April 2021, Little Germany was one of the areas where scenes for the second series of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; were being filmed. Some child and adult actors from the theatre school Articulate were to appear in some episodes.

==Geography==

The City of Bradford is situated on the edge of the Pennines, and is bounded to the east by the City of Leeds, the south by the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, and the southwest by the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale. The Lancashire Borough of Pendle lies to the west, whilst North Yorkshire districts of Craven and Harrogate lie to the north west and north east respectively. Bradford district has 3636 hectares of upland heathland, including Ilkley Moor where the peat bogs rise to above sea level. Less than 5% of the Bradford district is woodland. Greenspace accounts for 73.8% of the City of Bradford&#x27;s total area, domestic buildings and gardens comprise 12.1%, and the rest is made up of roads and non-domestic buildings.

Three river systems serve the City of Bradford, along with 23 km of canal. The Airedale towns of Keighley, Bingley and Shipley lie on the River Aire. The River Wharfe runs through Ilkley and Burley in Wharfedale, and tributaries of the River Calder run through the district. Unusually for a major settlement, Bradford is not built on any substantial body of water. The ford from which it takes its name (Broad-Ford) was a crossing of the stream called Bradford Beck.

===Parishes===
While most of Bradford is unparished, there are parish and town councils for most of the outlying towns and villages in the District. From 2009, the parishes are:
==Governance==
===Parliamentary constituencies===

The residents of Bradford are represented in the British Parliament by Members of Parliament (MPs) for five separate parliamentary constituencies. Bradford East is represented by Imran Hussain (Labour), Bradford West is represented by Naz Shah (Labour), Bradford South is represented by Judith Cummins (Labour), Shipley is represented by Philip Davies (Conservative), and
Keighley is represented by Robbie Moore (Conservative).

The city played an important part in the early history of the Labour Party. A mural on the back of the Priestley Centre For The Arts (visible from Leeds Road) commemorates the centenary of the founding of the Independent Labour Party in 1893.

===Council===
In 1974, City Of Bradford Metropolitan District Council was created to administer the newly formed metropolitan borough. The County Borough of Bradford was merged with the Borough of Keighley, the Urban Districts of Baildon, Bingley, Denholme, Ilkley, Shipley and Silsden, along with part of Queensbury and Shelf Urban District and part of Skipton Rural District by the Local Government Act 1972. The council, which is based at Bradford City Hall in Centenary Square, governs the whole metropolitan district. The city was granted the right on 18 September 1907 to elect a Lord Mayor.

The city is divided into 30 Electoral Wards, each ward electing three Councillors. Elections are held in May, where one third of the 90 seats (one for each ward) are contested and the successful candidate is elected for a period of four years.

===Electoral wards===
The Metropolitan District is divided into 30 electoral wards.

===Possible split of district===
Between 2020 and 2022 there was a campaign led by Philip Davies and Robbie Moore, the Conservative MPs for Shipley and Keighley, for their constituencies to break away from Bradford. They claimed the council&#x27;s focus was too much on Bradford urban area, to the detriment of the smaller centres of Bingley, Ilkley, Keighley, and Shipley, which they said suffered a lack of investment and service cuts as well as council tax hikes. The move for independence was criticised by Bradford City Council. Moore promoted a private member&#x27;s bill which would have allowed a referendum to be held on the matter, but it did not proceed beyond its second reading in the House of Commons in 2022.

===Coat of arms===

The coat of arms of Bradford City council is based on that of the former City and County Borough Council, with additions to indicate the merger of eleven Yorkshire councils. The boar&#x27;s head, as in the former city council&#x27;s crest, refers to the legend of the boar of Cliffe Wood. This was a ferocious wild boar that terrorised the populace and caused much damage to land and property; so much so that the Lord of the Manor offered a reward for anyone brave enough to slay the boar and bring its head to the Manor House. The mural crown is a frequent symbol of local government, but here also suggests a wellhead. The stag is derived from the device of the Denholme Urban District Council and the arms of the former Borough of Keighley, but represents the District as a whole. The white angora goat is retained from the former arms, recalling that the wool of this animal was used in the local industries. The roses on the collars refer to the Yorkshire rose and the compartment resembles the area&#x27;s hills and dales.

The original Bradford Coat of Arms had the Latin words &#x27;LABOR OMNIA VINCIT&#x27; below it, meaning Work conquers all.

==Demography==
At the 2011 UK census, the City of Bradford had a population of 522,452. Of the 180,246 households in Bradford, 36.5% were married couples living together, 28% were one-person households, 10.8% were lone parents and 8.4% were co-habiting couples, following a similar trend to the rest of England.
The population density was and for every 100 females, there were 92.8 males. Of those aged 16–74, 24.5% had no academic qualifications, lower than the 28.9% in all of England. 11.8% of Bradford residents were born outside the United Kingdom, higher than the England average of 9.2%.

In the 2011 census, it stated that 67.44% (352,317) of the city&#x27;s population was White (All White ethnic groups), 2.48% (12,979) (Mixed ethnic groups), 26.83% (140,149) (All Asian ethnic groups), 1.77% (9,267) (All Black ethnic groups) and 1.48% (7,740) (all other ethnic groups).

The ONS Regional Trends report, published in June 2009, showed that most of the urban core and 41% of the district as a whole were among the most deprived in the country, it also showed that 11% of the district as a whole were among the least deprived in the country. Bradford has one of the highest unemployment rates in England, with the economic inactivity rates of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups standing at over 50% of the working age population.

The crime rate in the City of Bradford is significantly higher than the national average, but lower than that of similar cities such as Manchester or Leeds.

==Tourism==
&quot;Brontë Country&quot; is an area including Western parts of the city as well as the area to the west. The City of Bradford includes the town of Haworth and the village of Thornton, the birthplace of the Brontë sisters.

Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, Ilkley&#x27;s Cow and Calf Rocks, Bradford&#x27;s National Science and Media Museum, Bradford City Park, Cartwright Hall, Saltaire village (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) and Salts Mill are key attractions that draw visitors from across the globe.

The City of Bradford has also become the first UNESCO City of Film.

Annual events such as the Bradford Literature Festival, Bradford Film Festival, Bradford Festival, Bradford Mela, Bingley Music Live, Ilkley Literature Festival, Haworth&#x27;s 1940s weekend, Saltaire Festival and special Christmas events take place across the district.

The value of tourism to the district&#x27;s economy stands at more than £500 million a year, with an estimated 8.6 million day trips within the district. The impact of this is more than 13,500 jobs supported by the tourism and retail sector.

==Economy==

The economy of Bradford is worth around £9.5 billion, contributing around 8.4% of the region&#x27;s output, and making the district the third largest after Leeds and Sheffield in Yorkshire &amp; Humber. Traditionally based on the wool and textile industries, manufacturing is still strong, accounting for around 1 in 5 jobs. The city&#x27;s service-sector economy accounts for 77% of the district&#x27;s 195,000 jobs, with today&#x27;s fastest-growing sectors including information technology, financial services, tourism and retail headquarters and distribution. The district is home to a number of large businesses with recognised brands operating on a national and international scale such as Morrisons, Pace Plc and Hallmark Cards. Three of the UK&#x27;s biggest financial institutions are based in Bradford: Yorkshire Building Society, Santander Group and Vanquis Banking Group. It is also home to nationally outstanding cultural businesses, a strong group of new media companies, and a significant national institution in the National Science and Media Museum. Tourism is worth over £400 million to the local economy, and employs over 10,000 people. Bradford&#x27;s exports are worth almost £700 million.

The city&#x27;s working-age population has risen by 3.3% since 2000, faster than any UK city outside London, whilst the population of the city itself is growing by twice the national average. Bradford has a younger age profile than the Yorkshire &amp; Humber regional average and the national average, with the younger age groups forming a greater proportion of the population in comparison. Bradford has been named by research group OMIS as one of the top six cities in the UK equipped for future growth, and the CBI reports that business confidence is higher in Bradford than in the UK as a whole, whilst £1.5 billion of construction work is transforming Bradford in a bid to attract further investment.

At the 2001 UK census, Bradford had 326,774 residents aged 16 to 74. 2.5% of these people were students with jobs, 7.6% looking after home or family, 6.1% permanently sick or disabled and 4.5% economically inactive for other reasons. The City of Bradford has a lower economic activity rate than West Yorkshire, the regional average for Yorkshire and the Humber and the national average. Conversely Bradford has a higher economic inactivity rate than all these areas and also has a lower employment rate.

Manufacturing is still strong in Bradford and accounts for almost 12% of all jobs, and the city&#x27;s service-sector economy accounts for 82% of the district&#x27;s 192,000 jobs. The entrepreneurial spirit is more present in Bradford than generally in the UK, with start-ups accounting for 12% of the business community.

Bradford&#x27;s GVA is over £6 billion.

==Transport==

===Public transit===
Public transport in Bradford is co-ordinated by Metro. Most local train services are run by Northern, with longer-distance services to London King&#x27;s Cross railway station served by Grand Central from Bradford Interchange and London North Eastern Railway from Bradford Forster Square station.

The Wharfedale line connects direct to Ilkley, Ben Rhydding, Burley-in-Wharfedale, Menston, Guiseley, Baildon, Shipley and Frizinghall railway stations with Bradford Forster Square. The Airedale line connects the stations at Morecambe, Lancaster, Settle, Carlisle, Skipton, Steeton &amp; Silsden, Keighley (change for the Brontë Country and the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway), Crossflatts, Bingley, Saltaire (UNESCO World Heritage Site) and Shipley, continuing to either Frizinghall and Bradford Forster Square or to Leeds to the east of the district. Both Bradford Forster Square and the district&#x27;s major and busiest railway station Bradford Interchange are served by the Leeds–Bradford lines with direct routes to Leeds, Selby, York, Brough and Hull. Bradford Interchange, via the Calder Valley line, also connects direct to stations at Manchester, Halifax, Rochdale, Burnley, Blackburn, Preston, Poulton-le-Fylde, Blackpool, Huddersfield, Wakefield, Doncaster, Chester, Warrington, and London King&#x27;s Cross.

There are bus stations in Bradford, Ilkley, Keighley and Shipley. The majority of services are provided by First Bradford and Keighley Bus Company.

===Air and water transport===
Leeds Bradford Airport itself is located in Yeadon, about to the north-east of the city centre, and has both charter and scheduled flights to destinations within Europe plus the United States, Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey. There are connections to the rest of the world via London Heathrow, Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.

There are also navigable waterways that run through the district. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes through numerous towns and villages in the borough, with the Grade I listed Five Rise Locks at Bingley generally considered to be one of the finest
feats of canal engineering in the country. There are also proposals to restore and re-open the Bradford Canal, which closed in 1922, as part of a wider regeneration of the city.

===Roadways===
The M606, a spur of the M62 motorway, connects the district with the national motorway network. The M606 was originally laid out to reach the centre of Bradford and beyond, but connects instead to the A6177 Bradford outer ring road, making the motorway one of the shortest in the country at less than long. Another motorway was planned in the 1970s, envisaging a link between Bradford, the Aire valley in the north of the district, and the M65 at Colne, roughly mirroring the existing A650 road. It has since been upgraded to be a dual carriageway along much of its length, bypassing the towns of Bingley and Keighley. The A658 road passes through a tunnel underneath the main Leeds Bradford Airport runway as it heads north-east from Bradford to Knaresborough.

====Clean air zone====
==Twin towns==
The City of Bradford, and the various towns and villages that make up the Metropolitan District, have Twin Town and Sister City Friendship Agreements with several other communities. Each was originally twinned with a place within the City of Bradford.

<text>Robert Allan Murphy (September 19, 1924 – August 3, 2004) was an American sportscaster who spent 50 years doing play-by-play of Major League Baseball games on television and radio. He was best known for announcing the New York Mets, from their inception in 1962 until his retirement in 2003. He was honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick Award in 1994.

==Early life==
Murphy was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1924.

==Broadcasting career==
Murphy made his first appearance in a baseball broadcast booth with the minor league Muskogee Reds. His first major league job was with the Boston Red Sox in , working alongside Curt Gowdy. In , he moved to the Baltimore Orioles for two seasons, replacing Ernie Harwell.

===New York Mets===
Murphy&#x27;s call of Roger Maris&#x27; record-tying 60th home run of the season became an audition tape that landed him a job with the expansion New York Mets in .

====Broadcasting style====
Murphy&#x27;s broadcasts were known for his optimistic outlook. He would rarely be critical of players and would always strive to emphasize the positive. According to Gary Thorne, who was his partner in the Mets radio booth from 1985 to 1988, Murphy felt that, &quot;the game was to be enjoyed and he sought out the joy in that day&#x27;s game to bring to the fans.&quot;

Murphy, despite his long association with the Mets, never openly rooted for the team from the booth. Listeners knew that he was happier when the Mets won, as evidenced by his mention of a &quot;happy recap&quot; after a Mets win and a &quot;recap&quot; after a Mets loss, but he never referred to the Mets as &quot;we&quot; and, reflecting his love of the game, he would sound equally excited when a good play was made against the Mets as he would when the Mets made a similar play.

Murphy was well known for his sunny outlook. He opened games saying &quot;the sun is shining, the sky is blue, it&#x27;s a beautiful day for baseball.” Because of this, an unprecedented display of crankiness on his part received much attention. On July 25, 1990, in Philadelphia, the Mets took a 10–3 lead into the ninth inning. But the rival Phillies opened the inning with seven consecutive singles, followed by a walk, and scored six runs to narrow the Mets lead to one run before the Mets were able to turn a double-play and get a line drive out. Murphy&#x27;s patience was apparently worn thin by the long inning. When the game finally ended, he famously exclaimed, &quot;A line drive caught. The game is over. The Mets win it. A line drive to Mario Díaz. And the Mets win the ballgame! They win the damn thing by a score of 10 to 9!&quot; The use of off-color language was so out of character that it was frequently cited as one of his more memorable moments following Murphy&#x27;s retirement from the booth in and later when the Mets honored him after his death in .

Murphy occupied the broadcasting booth in every stadium in the National League, including Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, which was named after his brother, Jack, a popular San Diego sportswriter.

====Broadcast partners====
From the Mets&#x27; first game in 1962 through the post-Tom Seaver days of 1978, on radio and television, the Mets games were announced by the trio of Murphy, along with Lindsey Nelson and Ralph Kiner. Nelson left after the 1978 season and was replaced by Steve Albert. Albert broadcast the Mets for three seasons.

Prior to 1982, the Mets announcers had done television and radio on a rotational system. While two were on TV, the other would take over on radio.

====After 1981====
However, in 1982, Murphy was taken out of the television booth, in order to announce the games on radio only. He was joined by Steve Lamar, who also strictly did radio for the Mets. Murphy became known for &quot;painting the word picture;” play-by-play of baseball on radio requires broadcaster to be able to inspire the listener&#x27;s imagination, which Murphy was cited as doing well. For the rest of his career, with the exception of occasional fill-in duty on the TV side, Murphy announced exclusively from the radio booth.

Murphy was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1984. He was paired with Gary Thorne from 1985 to 1988, and Thorne was his broadcast partner for his memorable call of Bill Buckner&#x27;s error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. Gary Cohen—the current TV voice of the Mets and Murphy&#x27;s longest tenured partner after Kiner and Nelson—shared the booth with him from 1989 through his 2003 retirement.

In 1994, Bob Murphy was honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame as a recipient of the prestigious Ford C. Frick Award. There is a display about Murphy in the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, as there is for former Mets partner Nelson, who had also won the award.

In 1995, Murphy briefly returned to television for NBC Sports, his first network broadcasts, calling regional action involving the Mets several times as part of Baseball Night in America.

He was voted into the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame in 2002.

===Other broadcasting areas===
In addition to his baseball work, Murphy was an announcer for the New York Titans (renamed the New York Jets) of the American Football League in 1962–63, and called some college football later in that decade.

He also broadcast minor league hockey and college football in his native Oklahoma. He was the voice of the Oklahoma Sooners during their 47-game winning streak during the 1950s.

Murphy also broadcast several Orange Bowl games in the 1980s on network radio. In addition, from September 17, 1973, through April 5, 1974, Murphy hosted the New York City edition of &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot;, on WOR-TV.

==Retirement==

In his later years, Murphy (a smoker) began having trouble calling games due to persistent throat inflammation. After the season, he left the broadcast booth and retired to Florida. He died of lung cancer August 3, 2004 in West Palm Beach. After his death, the Mets honored Murphy&#x27;s memory by wearing a patch on the left sleeve of their uniforms for the rest of the season. The Mets honored Murphy with a large plaque adorning the outfield wall of Citi Field, next to that of his long-time broadcast partner Ralph Kiner&#x27;s in April 2023.

<doc id="632798" wikidata="Q315513" url="?curid=632798" title="Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme">
<text>Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme, often simply called Vendôme (1 July 165411 June 1712) was a French general and Marshal of France. One of the great generals of his era, he was one of Louis XIV&#x27;s most successful commanders in the War of the Grand Alliance and War of the Spanish Succession.

Vendôme joined the French Army and was promoted Lieutenant General in 1688 after his distinguished combat record in the Franco-Dutch War. Further successes entitled him to his first army command in 1695, and soon after, he was rewarded with a promotion to Marshal of France.

Vendôme was one of the most aggressive and successful French army commanders during the wars of Louis XIV. His charisma, courage and skill won him the loyalty of his troops and the Spanish crown for the House of Bourbon.

==Biography==

Louis Joseph de Bourbon was born in Paris, the son of Louis, Duke of Vendôme and Laura Mancini. Orphaned at the age of fifteen, he inherited a vast fortune from his father that had been handed down from his great-grandmother, the &quot;duchesse de Mercœur et Penthièvre&quot;. Prior to succeeding his father in 1669, he was known as the &quot;duc de Penthièvre&quot;. He was raised by his aunt, Marie Anne Mancini, &quot;duchesse de Bouillon&quot;.

Entering the army at the age of eighteen, Vendôme soon distinguished himself by his vigour and personal courage in the Dutch wars, and by 1688, he had risen to the rank of lieutenant-general. In the Nine Years&#x27; War, he rendered conspicuous service under the &quot;duc de Luxembourg&quot; at the Battle of Steenkerke, and under Nicolas Catinat at Marsaglia. In 1695, he was placed in command of the army operating in Catalonia, where he took Barcelona in 1697.

Soon afterwards, Vendome was made a Marshal of France. In 1702, after the first unsuccessful campaign of Catinat and Villeroi, he was placed in command of the Franco-Spanish army in Italy. During three campaigns in that country, he proved himself a worthy antagonist to Prince Eugène of Savoy, whom he at last defeated in 1705 at Cassano in a magnificent show of courage and command over his troops, converting the impending defeat that his indolent brother Philippe had incurred, into a glorious success.

The next year, after holding his own as before, and gaining another victory at Calcinato, he was sent to Flanders to repair the disaster of Ramillies. Following the departure of Vendôme to shore up the shattered army in the Flanders, Prince Eugène and the Duke of Savoy inflicted a heavy loss on the French under the &quot;duc d&#x27;Orléans&quot; and Ferdinand de Marsin at the Battle of Turin, driving the French out of Italy by the end of the year. In Flanders, meanwhile, Vendôme quarrelled with the king&#x27;s unenterprising grandson, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, and was unable to prevent the French defeat at the Battle of Oudenarde.

In disgust, Vendôme retired to his estates. It wasn&#x27;t long, however, before he was summoned back to take command of the army of his cousin, Philip V of Spain. There, he won his last victories, crowning his work triumphantly in the battles of Brihuega and Villaviciosa. Before the end of the war, he died suddenly at Vinaròs on 11 June 1712 and was buried at El Escorial in Spain.

=== Assessment ===
Vendôme was one of the most remarkable soldiers in the history of the French army. He had, besides the skill and the fertile imagination of the true army leader, the brilliant courage of a soldier. The real secret of his continuous success, however, was his extraordinary influence over his men. He seldom made mistakes, and his opponent Eugene of Savoy praised the brilliance of some of his actions in his memoirs.

==Marriage==
Vendôme married Marie Anne de Bourbon, a daughter of Henri Jules, Prince of Condé and granddaughter of Le Grand Condé.

Marie Anne was unmarried at the time of her father’s death, and still had no marriage prospects when her brother, who became the Prince of Condé in 1709, died the next year. She could have married the &quot;duc du Maine&quot; in 1692, but Maine preferred Marie Anne&#x27;s sister, Anne Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon, and married her instead.

The marriage ceremony occurred at the chapel at the Château de Sceaux on 21 May 1710. Sceaux was the residence of Anne Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon. Louis Joseph was fifty-five years old at the time. He was a Marshal of France and had been designated as the heir of his cousin, King Philip V of Spain. In the event that Philip should die childless, the House of Bourbon had decided that Louis Joseph would become the next king of Spain. 

His marriage to Marie Anne remained childless though, perhaps due to the homosexual tendencies of Louis Joseph; Marie Anne died in 1718 without issue.

Although Louis XIV had given permission for the marriage, the manipulative &quot;duc&quot; and &quot;duchesse du Maine&quot; hurriedly arranged the details of the wedding, probably for mercenary reasons. Even though the Dowager Princess of Condé was not informed of the marriage, she was present at the bedding ceremony at Sceaux along with Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, his wife Marie Anne de Bourbon, the Dowager Princess of Conti, and her children the Prince of Conti and &quot;Mademoiselle de La Roche-sur-Yon&quot;.

On his death, Louis Joseph left his wife the duchy of Étampes and its lands. She held this title in her own right. When she died, it went to her niece, the Princess of Conti.

==Sexuality==
The Duke was known to be homosexual. Other members of his family, including his brother Philippe and his grandfather César, Duke of Vendôme, were also known for their homosexuality/bisexuality, which led to the family mansion on Place Vendôme being called the &quot;Hôtel de Sodome&quot; in the 17th century. According to Saint-Simon, Louis-Joseph &quot;plunged...more than anyone else&quot; into sodomy, satisfying his desires with &quot;his valets and officers&quot;. Saint-Simon wrote of the Duke&#x27;s relationship with Louis XIV that, although the King &quot;had always a singular horror of the inhabitants of the Cities of the Plain [homosexuals]...M. de Vendôme, though most odiously stained with that vice - so publicly that he treated it as an ordinary gallantry - never found his favor diminished on that account.&quot; Those who wished to curry favor with Vendôme would try and win over his lovers first. One contemporary account alleges that on his estate at the Chateau d&#x27;Anet, peasant men from the neighborhood would wait for the Duke in the woods when he went out hunting, hoping to be paid for sexual favors. 

Louis-Joseph suffered from syphilis and lost part of his nose to the disease. He was the first courtier to seek leave from court to be treated for the disease with Mercury salts, known as the &quot;Great Remedy&quot; (&quot;le grand remède&quot;).

<doc id="632799" wikidata="Q5596890" url="?curid=632799" title="Granville Elliott">
<text>Major-General Granville Elliott, 1st Count Elliott (7 October 1713 – 10 October 1759), was a British military officer who served with distinction in several other European armies and subsequently in the British Army. He fought at the Battle of Minden where he was wounded, dying of his injuries several weeks later.

==Early life==
Elliott was born on 7 September 1713 at Byfeld House, Church Road, Barnes, Surrey to Major-General Roger Elliott (c. 1665 – 15 May 1714) and his wife Charlotte (née Elliot, c. 1692 – c. 1753). A member of the Eliot military family, he was baptised on 27 October 1713 at St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Barnes. His godparents were George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne and Mrs Killigrew.

When Elliott was less than one year old, his father died and his sister, Catherine Elliott (1714–1755) was born soon after. Both siblings were brought up by their widowed mother and her new husband, Captain Thomas Burroughs. Later that decade, he was made a ward of his mother&#x27;s younger brother Colonel William Elliot (c. 1704 – 1764). In 1725, Elliott was admitted to Dr Dunster&#x27;s Academy in Little Marlborough Street, London, and in 1730 he matriculated as a Law Student at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.

==Continental European military career==

By 1732, Elliott was in the service of the HM Karl Philipp von Pfalz-Neuburg, Elector Palatine of the Rhine. On 7 March 1735, ahead of his marriage on 15 March 1735 at Mannheim to Jeanne Thérèse du Han, Comtesse de Martigny and lady of honour to the Empress of Germany (30 October 1707–7 May 1748), he was created a Chamberlain to his Majesty Charles VI and raised to the title of Comte de Morhange in the Moselle region. To facilitate the marriage, Elliott converted to Catholicism, and took the forename Joseph, which caused him problems with his mother&#x27;s Calvinist relatives.

In August 1736, he and his mother swore oaths at the College of Arms in London that the Elliott family descended from a legal marriage of Richard Eliot (b. 1614–unknown)—the wayward second son of Sir John Eliot (1592–1632)—to Catherine Killigrew (c.1617–1689), daughter of Sir Robert Killigrew (1580–1633) and Mary Woodhouse (c. 1584–1655). Although it remains probable that George Elliott was the illegitimate son of Richard and Catherine, the two oaths differed in some details, and no independent evidence for any marriage of Richard and Catherine has ever come to light. Moreover, Catherine Killigrew was still described as spinster when she executed her mother&#x27;s will in 1656, and Richard appears in visitations as &quot;&quot; (i.e. died a bachelor). As a result, Granville was not recognised by the College of Arms as a legitimate relative of the then Lord Eliot of Port Eliot in Cornwall, ancestors of the present Earls of St Germans. Nevertheless, he spent much time and trouble trying to prove Catherine had married Richard prior to George&#x27;s birth, making him a legal heir. He had a pedigree drawn up (which survives today) and formally presented to him in Paris by the British ambassador / plenipotentiary. As a result of this device, Elliott became known at the Elector&#x27;s Court as Comte Eliot de Port-Eliot, and Graf Eliot von Port-Eliot, effectively Count Elliott, an Imperial Count.

On 29 October 1736, Elliott was promoted to the rank of colonel, taking over the colonelcy of the Carabinier Regiment on 1 February 1737, and the Dragoons Regiment on 10 July 1738. In 1737, Elliott was appointed cavalry general of the States General of the Netherlands, the legislature of the Dutch Republic. A few years later, he was working at Lunéville, at the court of the exiled King Stanislaus I of Poland who had become Duke of Lorraine and Bar. On 22 April 1745, he was promoted to major-general of cavalry for the Elector Palatine; on 24 June 1746, to lieutenant-general of cavalry, and, on 2 November 1748, to lieutenant-general of cavalry for the States General of the Netherlands.

Elliott and his wife appeared regularly in the Madame de Graffigny correspondence, usually under his baptised name Joseph or his familiar name Cotoco. His wife died on 7 May 1748, and this caused a substantial change of direction for Elliott. He left his grown-up family with their French relatives, returned to Britain, forsook his Catholicism and repaired the bridges with his mother&#x27;s relatives. It appears that Elliott did not subsequently contact his French family, although there was no known ill-will between them.

==British military career==

Back in England, he remarried, on 3 September 1750, to Elizabeth Duckett (25 June 1724 – October 1804) at St. Mary Magdalen Old Fish Street, London. However, he soon returned to the service of the States General of the Netherlands, and was appointed major-general of the Scotch Brigade. The first child of his second marriage was born in the Netherlands although later children were born at their home in Kew.
On 21 April 1758, Elliott was made major-general in the British Army, and appointed colonel of the 61st Regiment of Foot – &quot;The Glorious Glosters&quot;. That summer, he was a staff officer on the army expedition to St Malo, and, from 5 July 1758 to 31 August 1758, he received a short-term commission as colonel and lieutenant-general in the Dutch Army.

The Seven Years&#x27; War had arrived, and Elliott&#x27;s knowledge of continental warfare was significant. In early 1759, he returned to continental Europe, as part of a massive British army deployment. At the Battle of Minden, on 1 August 1759, he commanded the Cavalry Regiment under John Manners, Marquess of Granby. Manners was himself second in command to Sir George Sackville, who was later cashiered for his inaction at the battle. Despite this chain of command, Elliott saw significant action in battle, and was seriously wounded. He retired to convalesce at army headquarters in Rodheim an der Bieber, Gießen, Hesse, Germany, but died there nine weeks later on 10 October 1759 from the wounds incurred. He was buried with military honours in the local 13th century church at Krofdorf on 12 October; Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick attended the funeral. A brass commemorative plaque was erected during the 20th century by his British descendants in the church.

Light Cavalry was introduced into the British Army as a direct result of advice from General Granville Elliott.

==Family==
Granville Elliott married twice.

Firstly, on 15 March 1735 at Mannheim, to Jeanne Thérèse du Han, Comtesse de Martigny (30 October 1707 – 7 May 1748), by whom he had at least six sons and a daughter.
#Marie Charlotte Elliott (23 May 1736 – 3 February 1785)
#Stanislaus François Xavier Elliott (6 July 1737 – after 1752)
#Amable Gaspard Antoine Elliott (4 September 1738 – 14 June 1814), 2nd Count Elliott
#Charles Phillippe Elliott (1 December 1740 – unknown)
#Paul Antoine Elliott (12 June 1741 – 25 July 1741)
#François Maximillian Elliott (12 June 1741 – unknown)
#Jean-Baptiste-François Elliott (25 June 1747 – unknown)

Secondly, on 3 September 1750 at St. Mary Magdalen Old Fish Street, to Elizabeth Duckett (25 June 1724 – October 1804), by whom he had at least three sons and three daughters. Elizabeth was the daughter of Colonel William Duckett MP (died 1749) and a niece of Sir George Duckett. 
#Mary Frances Elliott (28 May 1751 – 26 September 1752)
#William Roger Elliott (10 May 1753 – before 26 June 1753)
#Francis Perceval Eliot (September 1755 – 23 August 1818)
#Catherine Frances Elliott (20 January 1757 – 10 March 1757)
#John Lewis Elliott (29 June 1758 – December 1819)
#Elizabeth Georgiana Elliott (21 July 1759 – 22 November 1759)

Of the children of his second marriage, Francis Perceval Eliot and his descendants continued the family&#x27;s close connection with British armed forces. Francis also re-established contact with his French half-siblings.

Upon Elliott&#x27;s death in 1759, his titles passed to his oldest living son Amable Gaspard Antoine Elliott. Amable chose his half-brother Francis Perceval Eliot to succeed him on his 1814 death as Count Eliot. However, Francis thought this was not proper and died in 1818 without assuming the title.

<doc id="632803" wikidata="Q7186921" url="?curid=632803" title="Phoenix Memo">
<text>The Phoenix Memo is a letter sent to FBI headquarters on July 10, 2001, by FBI Special Agent Kenneth Williams, recommending the assembling of a worldwide listing of civil aviation schools. Williams, then stationed in Phoenix, Arizona, was investigating students at some of these schools for possible terrorist links.

==Content==
According to Williams, the purpose of the memo was to:

advise the Bureau and New York of the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges. Phoenix has observed an inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest who are attending or who have attended civil aviation universities and colleges in the State of Arizona.

The recommendations outlined by Williams were ignored or put aside because of other concerns. The memo was seen by at least one dozen officials of the FBI, including John P. O&#x27;Neill, but it was never passed to acting director Thomas J. Pickard, his successor Robert Mueller or the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, the existence of the memo was not made known to President George W. Bush and his senior national security staff until May 2002. 

Mueller told the U.S. Congress in an emotional hearing in May 2002 that failure to act on the memo was the result of deficits in the FBI’s analytical capabilities.

== Coleen Rowley (2002) ==
The memo became the subject of another communiqué in June 2002, when FBI Agent Coleen Rowley took advantage of the federal Whistleblower Protection Act provisions to inform FBI Director Robert Mueller that his public statements about lack of “advance knowledge” by the bureau had no basis in fact. In her memo, Rowley wrote about the alleged suppression of the investigation concerning Zacarias Moussaoui.

<text>François le Métel de Boisrobert (1 August 1592 – 30 March 1662) was a French poet, playwright, and courtier.

==Life==
He was born in Caen. He trained as a lawyer, later practising for a time in Rouen. He traveled to Paris in 1622 and established employment at court, for he had a share in the ballet of the &quot;Bacchanales&quot; performed at the Louvre in February. In 1630 visited Rome, where he won the favour of Pope Urban VIII and was made a canon of Rouen.

He was introduced to Cardinal Richelieu in 1623, and became one of five poets to inspire Richelieu&#x27;s works. It was Boisrobert who suggested to Richelieu the plan of the Académie française, and he was one of its earliest and most active members. These efforts resulted in him becoming quite wealthy. After the death of Richelieu, he became affiliated with Mazarin, whom he served faithfully throughout the Fronde. In his later years, he dedicated much of his time to his duties as a priest.

He wrote a number of comedies and contributed to numerous others, including &quot;La Belle Plaideuse&quot; and Molière&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot;. &quot;Contes&quot;, published under the name of his brother D&#x27;Ouville, is also often largely attributed to him.

<text>St. John&#x27;s South—Mount Pearl (; formerly St. John&#x27;s South) is a federal electoral district in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 2004.

==Demographics==
Ethnic groups: 99.2% White 
Languages: 98.7% English 
Religions: 52.8% Catholic, 42.4% Protestant, 3.6% no affiliation 
Average income: $25 379

==Geography==
The district includes the south end of the City of St. John&#x27;s, the City of Mount Pearl, and the Town of Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove.

The neighbouring ridings are Avalon and St. John&#x27;s East.

According to Elections Canada, the geographic boundaries of this riding for the 39th General Election are:

:&quot;All that area consisting of:

:: (a) that part of the City of St. John&#x27;s lying southeasterly of the southeasterly limits of the towns of Conception Bay South and Paradise, and southeasterly of a line described as follows: commencing at the intersection of the westerly limit of the City of St. John&#x27;s with Kenmount Road immediately north of the northwesterly limit of the City of Mount Pearl; thence northeasterly and easterly along said road, Freshwater Road and Longs Hill to Gower Street; thence northeasterly along said street to Kings Bridge Road; thence northerly along said road to Rennie&#x27;s River; thence generally easterly along said river, Quidi Vidi Lake and the channel known locally as Quidi Vidi Gut to Quidi Vidi Harbour;

::(b) the City of Mount Pearl; and

::(c) the Town of Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove. Including all islands adjacent to the shoreline of the above-described area.&quot;

See also Elections Canada&#x27;s map of the riding (.PDF).

==History==
The electoral district was created in 2003: 95.1% of the population of the riding came from St. John&#x27;s West, and 4.9% from St. John&#x27;s East ridings. As of the 2012 electoral redistribution, 5% of this riding would be moved to St. John&#x27;s East, and it would gain 3% from Avalon.

The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of St. John&#x27;s South—Mount Pearl should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined St. John&#x27;s South—Mount Pearl had its boundaries legally defined in the 2013 representation order which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for 19 October 2015.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, most of this riding will be moved to the new riding of Cape Spear. It gains Paradise from Avalon and St. John&#x27;s East; loses Witless Bay, Bay Bulls and the Southlands and Goulds areas of St. John&#x27;s to Avalon; and loses the remainder of St. John&#x27;s Harbour, the Wishingwell Park area and the Ayre Athletic Field area to St. John&#x27;s East.

<text>Andrzej Gwiazda (born 14 April 1935 in Pińczów) is an engineer and prominent opposition leader, who participated in Polish March 1968 Events and December 1970 Events; one of the founders of Free Trade Unions, Member of the Presiding Committee of the Strike at Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk in August 1980, Vice President of the Founding Committee of Solidarity, then Vice President of Solidarity in 1980 and 1981; in December 1981 interned and next imprisoned with six other Solidarność leaders (see Martial Law in Poland). His wife, Joanna Duda-Gwiazda (they married in 1961) also was a prominent member of the anticommunist opposition in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Life and activism==
Gwiazda&#x27;s father was a sailor of the Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy, stationed in Pińsk (now Belarus), where the family moved in 1939, a few months before the outbreak of World War II. His father Stanisław fought in the Polish September Campaign, as a soldier of Independent Operational Group Polesie. After capitulation of Poland he was caught by the Germans, and spent the war in Oflag II-C in Woldenberg. Young Andrzej, together with mother Zofia (née Zamojska) and grandmother, was in 1940 deported by the Soviets (see Soviet invasion of Poland, Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)) to Kazakhstan, where they stayed until 1946. After the return and reuniting with Stanisław Gwiazda, the family first settled in Upper Silesia, then they moved to Gdańsk, where Andrzej studied electronics at Gdańsk University of Technology, graduating in 1966. After graduation, he worked at Cybernetics Institute of the University, and in 1973 took a job at Power Supplies Factory Elmor in Gdańsk.

Gwiazda married Joanna Duda-Gwiazda in 1961. After marriage, Andrzej and Joanna became more active in anticommunist movements. In 1968, Andrzej was involved in student protests in opposition to the Polish government. In December 1970, he participated in demonstration protesting the dramatic rise in food prices. In 1976, together with his wife, he wrote a letter to the Polish Parliament, in which he expressed support of Workers&#x27; Defence Committee. Soon afterwards, the Gwiazdas were officially banned from leaving the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, they were also under the surveillance of Służba Bezpieczeństwa. In 1978, Gwiazda was one of the founders of Free Trade Unions of the Coast (WZZ), publishing and delivering &quot;Worker of the Coast&quot;, a bulletin of the WZZ. On 16 August 1980, he initiated an industrial action at Elmor. He then became a member of the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, and co-authored the famous 21 demands of MKS. However, he did not sign the Gdańsk Agreement, claiming that the workers, upon advice of their legal experts, agreed for too many concessions to the government. Arrested on 13 December 1981 (see Martial law in Poland, he was transported to a prison camp in Strzebielinek. Later on, Gwiazda was transferred to a jail in Warsaw’s district of Białołęka. Finally, Gwiazda was released on 22 July 1984, after an amnesty. On 16 December 1984, he was arrested again, after a scuffle with ZOMO officers, and sentenced to five months. After spending time in prisons in Gdańsk and Zabrze, he was released on 15 May 1985.
In 1986 - 1989, Gwiazda was one of leaders of &quot;Working Group of National Commission of Solidarity&quot;. The group was opposed to any forms of negotiations with Communist authorities. Unlike Lech Wałęsa, Gwiazda did not participate in creation of the Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee, nor in the negotiations of Polish Round Table Talks. He remains a firm skeptic about Wałęsa, saying that &quot;from the beginning of the strike at the Gdańsk Shipyard, he was acting to the detriment of Solidarity&quot;. Also, he says that Wałęsa should never have been made &quot;a symbol of Poland&quot;.

<doc id="632815" wikidata="Q1161526" url="?curid=632815" title="Wet T-shirt contest">
<text>A wet T-shirt contest is a competition involving exhibitionism, typically featuring young female contestants at a nightclub, bar, or resort. Wet T-shirt contestants generally wear thin white or light-colored T-shirts without bras, bikini tops, or other garments beneath. Water (often ice water) is then sprayed or poured onto the participants&#x27; chests, causing their T-shirts to turn translucent and cling to their breasts. The comparatively rarer male equivalent is the wet boxer contest, sometimes held at gay bars.

Contestants may take turns dancing or posing before the audience, with the outcome decided either by crowd reaction or by judges&#x27; vote. In racier contests, participants may tear or crop their T-shirts to expose their midriffs, cleavage, or the undersides of their breasts. Depending on local laws, participants may be allowed to remove their T-shirts or strip completely naked during their performance.

== History ==

In the United States, skiing filmmaker Dick Barrymore claims in his memoir &quot;Breaking Even&quot; to have held the first wet T-shirt contest at Sun Valley, Idaho&#x27;s Boiler Room Bar in January 1971, as part of a promotion for K2 skis. The contest was promoted as a simple &quot;T-shirt contest&quot; in which airline stewardesses would dance to music wearing K2 promotional T-shirts. However, the first contestant to appear was a professional stripper who danced topless and the amateur contestants responded by drenching their T-shirts before competing. Barrymore held a second &quot;K2 Wet T-Shirt Contest&quot; in the Rusty Nail at Stowe Mountain Resort, Vermont in order to film it, despite the fact that Stowe City Council had passed a resolution banning nudity at the event. He held another promotional contest for K2 on 10 March 1971 at Aspen, Colorado&#x27;s The Red Onion restaurant and bar, and the contests were featured in a pictorial in the March 1972 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

The first known mention of the term &quot;wet T-shirt contest&quot; in the press occurred in 1975 in &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;, describing the contest&#x27;s appearance at New Orleans discotheques. The contest subsequently became established at spring break events in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with some bar owners being fined under public indecency laws for holding one. Despite a lack of clarity as to their legal status, contests began to take place elsewhere in the United States. A contest in a Milwaukee tavern in 1976 was subject to a police raid, despite contestants wearing Scotch Tape under their T-shirts as required by the police. 

Jacqueline Bisset&#x27;s appearance in the 1977 film &quot;The Deep&quot;, where she swam underwater wearing only a T-shirt for a top, helped to bring the wet T-shirt contest to broader public awareness. On Frank Zappa&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; the track &quot;Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt&quot; tells of Mary from Canoga Park who takes part in a wet T-shirt contest in order to raise money to return home after being abandoned by a rock group in Miami.

The 2003 American reality film &quot;The Real Cancun&quot; included a wet T-shirt contest.

The Spanish festival of La Tomatina, a large public tomato fight where participants become soaked with juice from tomatoes, has been suggested as another possible origin of the wet T-shirt contest, although La Tomatina began in 1945.

==Examples of inappropriate contests==
===Law firm===
In 1983, the King &amp; Spalding law firm in Atlanta asked female summer interns attending that firm&#x27;s annual picnic to participate in a wet T-shirt contest. The proposed contest was replaced with a swimsuit competition and the winner was promised a permanent job on graduation. Some participants said they felt humiliated but did not protest because they were candidates for jobs with the firm. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; included details of the event in a front-page article on sex discrimination in large law firms. The fact that a wet T-shirt contest was proposed led to the case being used to demonstrate institutional sexism in law firms.

===In-flight contest===
In 1998, teenagers from Portland, Oregon, celebrating the completion of high school held a wet T-shirt contest on a Boeing 727 en route to a Mexican resort, with a flight attendant encouraging the activity. An FAA investigation followed, as pilots supposedly judged the contest on the flight deck, disregarding rules that passengers are not allowed in the cockpit. A video showed contestants emerging from the cockpit wearing wet T-shirts. The FAA disciplined the pilots for sexual misconduct.

===Underage contestants===
Lawsuits have been filed on behalf of underaged contestants who lied about their age to participate in wet T-shirt contests.

In 2002, the parents of teenager Monica Pippin brought a federal lawsuit against Playboy Entertainment, Anheuser-Busch, Deslin Hotels, Best Buy, and other companies relating to her appearance the previous year in a Daytona Beach wet T-shirt contest, at which time she had been a 16-year-old high school student. Pippin had danced topless during the contest and had allowed men to pour jugs of water over her bare breasts. After footage of her performance began to appear in videos and on cable television, a neighbor alerted Pippin&#x27;s parents, who retained a lawyer. Although Pippin admitted in court that she had lied to contest organizers about her age, her attorney claimed that, as a minor, she was unable to give informed consent to perform or be filmed topless. Pippin settled with Anheuser-Busch and Playboy in April 2006.

In a similar suit in 2007, two women sued Deslin Hotels, Girls Gone Wild, and various websites that published footage of their appearance in another 2001 Daytona Beach contest. The two girls, who were both sixteen at the time, had been filmed exposing their breasts, buttocks, and pubic areas. Like Pippin, they had lied about their age to gain admission to the contest.

<text>Port Union, also known as Centennial Scarborough is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the south-east corner of Toronto, within the former suburb of Scarborough. The neighbourhood is bounded by Kingston Road to the north, Port Union Road to the east, the Lake Ontario shoreline to the south, and Highland Creek to the west.

The neighbourhood originated as the small lakefront town of Port Union in the 19th century, within the area now known as West Rouge, until 1974 part of the Township of Pickering. It was later developed as a suburban bedroom community after the Second World War. Since the 1990s, the industrial lands along the waterfront have been transformed into new subdivisions, along with a paved walkway and bike path along the shore of Lake Ontario. The neighbourhood has many mature trees, parkland and waterfront. It is an affluent neighbourhood with 93% home ownership.

==History==
The area was settled in Charles Annis (1793) and by Thomas Adams (1808), but a community did not emerge until the 1830s.

The original village of Port Union was founded in the early to mid-1800s immediately south-east of the current-day intersection of Port Union Rd and Lawrence Avenue. While currently part of Toronto, the original area of the community was within Pickering Township. By 1865 the community had a post office.

In 1974, as part of the municipal government reforms that introduced the Regional Municipality of Durham, the West Rouge area of Pickering (bordered by Port Union Rd in the west, the Rouge River in the east, and Twyn Rivers Drive in the north) was annexed by Scarborough, which in turn was amalgamated into Toronto in 1998.

==Education==

Three public school boards operate within the neighbourhood of Port Union, the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the separate Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB).

TDSB operates three public elementary and secondary schools (One of which called Charrletown junior public school )in the neighbourhood. Elementary schools in Port Union include Centennial Road Junior Public School and Charlottetown Junior Public School. Sir Oliver Mowat Collegiate Institute is a TDSB secondary school established in 1970.

In addition to TDSB, the neighbourhood is also home to elementary schools operated by the CSCM, and TCDSB, two separate school boards. St. Brendan Catholic School is a public elementary school operated by TCDSB, whereas École élémentaire catholique Saint-Michel is a French-language public elementary school operated by CSCM.

==Recreation==
Port Union is home to several municipal parks operated by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. Major parks in the neighbourhood include Adams Park, which is located on Lawson road. It is a very popular park. Adams Park has a toboggan hill in the winter, a soccer field in the summer, and two playgrounds. It also includes two baseball diamonds that are regularly used by neighborhood youth.

Centennial Park, a park that contains a grassy area with a children&#x27;s playground, located next to the sports fields at Centennial Road Junior Public School at 225 Centennial Road. This should not be confused with the major recreational facility located in the former city of Etobicoke.

<doc id="632827" wikidata="Q376793" url="?curid=632827" title="Turnbuckle">
<text>A turnbuckle, stretching screw or bottlescrew is a device for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables, tie rods, and other tensioning systems. It normally consists of two threaded eye bolts, one screwed into each end of a small metal frame, one with a conventional right-hand thread and the other with a left-hand thread. The tension can be adjusted by rotating the frame, which causes both eye bolts to be screwed in or out simultaneously, without twisting the eye bolts or attached cables.

==Uses==
Turnbuckles are most commonly used in applications which require a great deal of tension; they can range in mass from about for thin cable used in a garden fence, to tonnes for structural elements in buildings and suspension bridges.

===Aircraft===
Turnbuckles have been used in aircraft construction, especially during the early years of aviation. Historically, biplanes might use turnbuckles to adjust the tension on structural wires bracing their wings. Turnbuckles are also widely used on flexible cables in flight control systems. In both cases they are secured with lockwire or specifically designed wire clips to prevent them from turning and losing tension due to vibration.

===Shipping===
Turnbuckles are used for tensioning a ship&#x27;s rigging and lashings. A variant of the turnbuckle called a bottle screw features an enclosed tubular body.

===Entertainment industry===
Turnbuckles are used in nearly all rigging performed in the entertainment industry, including theatre, film, and live concert performances. In entertainment rigging, turnbuckles are more commonly used to make small adjustments in line lengths. This is generally to make a flown (hoisted) unit sit parallel to the stage. Another way a turnbuckle could prove helpful is with making very minor height or angle adjustments.

===Pipe systems===
Turnbuckles are used in piping systems as a way to provide minor adjustments for field inconsistencies. This also allows for a minimum amount of resistance when transferring the load to the support components.

===Orthopaedics===
A type of splint is used for upper limb to produce gradual stretching over contracted joint by its turn buckle mechanism. Used to treat stiff elbow and Volkmann Ischemic Contracture.

<text>The Severn River , a perennial river that forms part of the Border Rivers group, is part of the Macintyre catchment of the Murray–Darling basin, located in the Northern Tablelands and North West Slopes regions of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==
The river rises on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, north of Glen Innes and flows generally northwest, joined by eleven tributaries, including Beardy Waters, and impounded by Lake Pindari, near Ashford. The river reaches its confluence with the Macintyre River, north of Wallangra; descending over its course.

===Recreation===

The Severn River flows through Kwaimbal National Park. A rare plant, the Severn River heath-myrtle is restricted to the Severn River Nature Reserve and an adjacent property, about north-west of Glen Innes.

Excellent fishing can be found along the river and is regularly stocked with native fingerlings, Murray Cod and Golden Perch.

The Severn River Rail Bridge on the now disused Main North Railway Line, west-south-west of Dundee has been placed on the Register of the National Estate. This bridge consists of a series of timber trusses completed in 1886 and is long, with fifteen spans totalling . When completed it was the longest timber truss bridge in Australia.

<doc id="632834" wikidata="Q456869" url="?curid=632834" title="2004–05 FA Premier League">
<text>The 2004–05 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Barclays]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the 13th season of the Premier League. It began on 14 August 2004 and ended on 15 May 2005. Arsenal were the defending champions after going unbeaten the previous season. Chelsea won the title with a then record 95 points, which was previously set by Manchester United in the 1993–94 season, and later surpassed by Manchester City in the 2017–18 season (100), securing the title with a 2–0 win at the Reebok Stadium against Bolton Wanderers. Chelsea also broke a number of other records during their campaign, most notably breaking the record of most games won in a single Premier League campaign, securing 29 wins in the league in home and away matches, which was later surpassed by themselves in the 2016–17 season.

==Season summary==
Arsenal were the favourites to defend their title after finishing the previous season unbeaten, but they also faced competition in the form of regular challengers Manchester United and Chelsea, the latter under the new management of Portuguese José Mourinho, who had just won the UEFA Champions League with Porto. Liverpool also had a new manager in Spaniard Rafael Benítez, who had just won La Liga and the UEFA Cup with Valencia and were expected to challenge for the title too. Another managerial change at a club aiming for the top was at Tottenham Hotspur, who appointed Jacques Santini, who had just led France to the quarter-finals of the 2004 European Championship.

At the other end of the table, amongst those tipped for relegation were Norwich City, Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion, having all just been promoted from the First Division (rebranded this season as the Championship). Everton, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth were also tipped to struggle, the first three finishing just outside the relegation places the previous season and Portsmouth being in their second season.

Arsenal&#x27;s record-breaking unbeaten streak of 49 games ended on 24 October 2004, when Manchester United beat them 2–0 at Old Trafford.

===Relegation===
For the first time since the advent of the Premier League in 1992, no team was relegated before the final day of the season. In each of the last three weekends of the season, the team that was bottom of the table at the start of the weekend finished it outside the drop zone. The final round of the season began with West Bromwich Albion at the bottom, Southampton and Crystal Palace one point ahead and Norwich City a further point ahead, in the last safe spot. West Brom, who had been bottom of the table and eight points from safety on Christmas Day, did their part by beating Portsmouth 2–0. Norwich, the only side to have their fate completely in their own hands, lost 6–0 to Fulham and went down. Southampton took the lead against Manchester United within 10 minutes through a John O&#x27;Shea own goal, but ultimately lost the match 2–1 and were also relegated. Crystal Palace, away to Charlton Athletic, were leading 2–1 after 71 minutes, but with eight minutes to go, Jonathan Fortune equalised for Charlton to send their South East London rivals down. Had Palace won they would have stayed up; instead they became the first team to be relegated from the Premier League four times. As a result, West Brom stayed up, becoming the first club in Premier League history to avoid relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas.

As all four matches ended, cameras focused on West Brom&#x27;s home ground, The Hawthorns, as confirmation of other results began to filter through. Once the realisation dawned on the players and fans that survival had been achieved, a mass pitch invasion was sparked, with huge celebrations. The Portsmouth fans joined in the celebrations as, through losing, they had &quot;helped&quot; relegate arch-rivals Southampton.

==Teams==
Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Norwich City, West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace, returning to the top flight after an absence of nine, one and six years respectively. They replaced Leicester City, Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers, who were relegated to the newly branded Football League Championship. Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers were both relegated after a season&#x27;s presence, while Leeds United ended their top flight spell of fourteen years.

<doc id="632836" wikidata="Q1009515" url="?curid=632836" title="Glen Innes, New South Wales">
<text>Glen Innes is a parish and town on the Northern Tablelands, in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia. It is the centre of the Glen Innes Severn Shire Council. The town is located at the intersection of the New England Highway and the Gwydir Highway. At the 2016 census, Glen Innes had a population of 6,155.

==History==
The original owners of Glen Innes and surrounding areas are the Ngarabal people. The Ngarabal name of the township of Glen Innes is Gindaaydjin, meaning &quot;plenty of big round stones on clear plains&quot;.
The arrival of European settlers saw the significant disruption of the life of Ngarabal people. Many Ngarabal people continue to live in the Glen Innes area, still practising many aspects of their traditional culture and way of life.

In about 1838 Archibald Boyd registered the first run in the Glen Innes district. Two stockmen known as &quot;the Beardies&quot; because of their long beards took Boyd to this area to establish his run. The Beardies later introduced other squatters to the best runs in the area to become known as the Land of the Beardies or Beardie Plains.
Furracabad Station was suggested by John James Galloway as an alternative to Wellingrove for a new town. However Furracabad Station was sold in the 1840s depression and passed to Major Archibald Clunes Innes, then to the Bank of Australasia, then to John Major, who sold it to Archibald Mosman. The name Glen Innes is believed to be bestowed by Mosman in honour of Innes. Glen Innes was gazetted as a town in 1852 and the first lots were sold in 1854. The post office was established in August 1854 and the court in 1858 when they replaced the Wellingrove offices. In 1866 the population was about 350, with a telegraph station, lands office, police barracks, courthouse, post office and two hotels. There was still no coach service at this time, but in the 1870s a road was constructed to Grafton.

Tin was first discovered at Emmaville in 1872 and Glen Innes became the centre of a mining bonanza during the late 19th century. In 1875, the population had swelled to about 1,500 and the town had a two-teacher school, three churches, five hotels, two weekly newspapers, seven stores and a variety of societies and associations. On 19 August 1884 the new Main North railway from Sydney opened. The arrival of the rail service and the expansion of mining contributed a new prosperity in the town, which is reflected in some of the beautiful buildings there.

The centre of the town retains some of its federation buildings and the owners have painted these buildings in the traditional colours. Many of these buildings have been placed on the Register of the National Estate.

The town boasts a railway station that was once part of the Main North Line. Today, the line is closed so the station is not in use and the buildings have been repurposed.

== Heritage listings ==
Glen Innes has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Bourke Street: Glen Innes Showground
* Grey Street: Glen Innes Post and Telegraph Office
* Main Northern railway: Glen Innes railway station

==Industries==

The Glen Innes district has been a producer of wool, sheep and beef cattle since it was first settled. Sapphires are mined in the creek valleys immediately west of town, and while tin is no longer commercially mined, mineral exploration is ongoing. The town holds regular livestock sales in the local sale-yards. The town contains all of the regular service industries required by the community. Notable individual businesses include a photographic processing facility, an exporter of waste material balers, a large cattle feedlot, and transport depots. Sawmilling was historically a major industry of the district, but is now only conducted on a reasonable scale by the local minimum-security prison. The conversion of State Forests into National Parks has led to tourism becoming an important employer.

<text>Mafia is a 2002 action-adventure game developed by Illusion Softworks and published by Gathering of Developers. The game was released for Windows in August 2002, and later ported to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004. Set within the fictional city of Lost Heaven, Illinois, during the 1930s, the story follows the rise and fall of taxi driver-turned-mobster Tommy Angelo within the Salieri crime family.

&quot;Mafia&quot; received critical acclaim for the Windows version, with critics praising the game for its complex narrative and realism, while the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions both received mixed reviews. The game launched the &quot;Mafia&quot; series, beginning with the first sequel, &quot;Mafia II&quot;, which was developed by 2K Czech and released in August 2010. Hangar 13 developed an additional three entries in the series, namely the sequel &quot;Mafia III&quot;, released in October 2016; a remake of the first game, &quot;&quot;, which was released in September 2020; and a prequel, &quot;&quot;, set to release in 2025.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mafia&quot;″s storyline gameplay consists of driving, mainly easy city cruises between different locations, as well as chases and races; the rest of the game is based on third-person on-foot navigation and shooting - all inter-connected with cutscenes. In addition to the city and countryside, detailed interiors like the city&#x27;s airport, a museum, a church, a hotel, an abandoned prison, restaurants, and Don Salieri&#x27;s bar are included. Weather changes and day/night cycles are in use, though missions take place at a set time and the weather is fixed during the duration of the level.

51 cars around the city can be driven in &quot;Mafia&quot;, plus nineteen bonus cars (five of which are racing models) unlockable after the main mode and the opening of a new game mode. Cars are introduced periodically - in the beginning of the game, early 1920s models drive on the streets of the city, while models from the early 1930s begin appearing in later game stages. All of the vehicles are based on real-world cars from the era, albeit renamed and redesigned due to trademark issues.

Police book players for minor offenses such as speeding or running a red light, and car accidents cause physical harm to the driving player. While other forms of transport are available, such as streetcars and the elevated rails of the Lost Heaven Railroad, they are only ridable and not drivable by the player.

&quot;Mafia&quot; is noted for having comprehensive damage physics on nearly all vehicles, even going so far as to make use of real-time deformation, compared to vehicles in other games that used pre-made damage models. While substantially more robust than their real counterparts, smaller and weaker vehicles stand less abuse before breaking down and finally exploding, than large armored vehicles. More realism is added here compared to other games in the same genre, such as the ability to puncture the fuel tank, overheat the engine, and the ability to break transmission gears. Many exterior components (such as windows, tires, headlights, and bumpers) can be removed from most vehicles with physical means such as crash-driving, hitting with blunt weapons (fists, baseball bat) as well as firing weapons at them.

Finishing the main storyline unlocks the &quot;Freeride Extreme&quot; mode, which is essentially the same as Freeride, but with the added benefit of stunt jumps, side quests, and the lack of police patrols. Side missions in this mode range from the trivial, such as carrying packages or killing gangsters, to the extreme and sometimes outlandish, like chasing an alien spaceship or driving an explosive-rigged truck at a certain speed.

=== Major and minor offense system ===
The police department in Lost Heaven uphold the various laws that have been set. When these laws are broken in view of the police, they will respond by booking the player with offenses that can be &quot;minor&quot; or &quot;serious&quot;. Minor offenses (such as speeding in a vehicle or running a red light) will end up with the player being fined (-$1,000 in Freeride mode; no monetary value in campaign mode), and serious offenses (such as physical assault, or visible display of a weapon) can lead to the player being arrested for the first offense, or a shootout with the police. A series of four successive minor offenses qualify as a &quot;serious&quot; offense. Police force increases with the severity of the player&#x27;s disregard of the law to a point where police, now well armed, form blockades with tire spike strips in attempt to defeat the player while firing from behind their cars.

== Synopsis ==
===Setting===

&quot;Mafia&quot; takes places within the fictional U.S. city of Lost Heaven, Illinois, during the final years of Prohibition in the 1930s. The West and East River divides the city it into three boroughs: West Side (on the Saint Peter Coast), consisting of industrial buildings, the main port, and residential communities inhabited by Chinese and Italian immigrants; Central Island, dividing the river and consisting of the city&#x27;s commercial district and municipal buildings; and East Side (on the Saint Paul Coast), consisting of both residential suburbs and slums, a bustling downtown district, and the city&#x27;s local armory and stadium. The city features surrounding countryside that includes a hydroelectric dam, international airport, and a race circuit. The game&#x27;s main story involves two major mafia families—the Salieri family, and the Morello family—who fight for control over the city&#x27;s rackets in the wake of the demise of a third mafia family. Alongside the two groups, the city features a variety of smaller street gangs.

Much of the city&#x27;s design, including the architectural styles, public transportation and landmarks, are inspired from real-life American cities of the period, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. The overall size of the setting encompasses around .

===Plot===
In 1930, taxi driver Tommy Angelo is forced by Paulie and Sam, two members of the Salieri crime family, into helping them escape an ambush by the rival Morello family. Tommy is compensated for his help and offered a position in the organization of Don Salieri. Forced to accept the offer the following day, when two Morello gangsters track him down and destroy his cab in an act of revenge, Tommy is welcomed into the Salieri family and begins assisting with running their rackets across the city, overseen by Salieri&#x27;s trusty consigliere Frank Colletti.

In 1932, Tommy enters a relationship with Sarah, the daughter of Salieri&#x27;s bartender, after protecting her from a gang of street thugs. On Salieri&#x27;s orders, Tommy and Paulie retaliate against the gang, but learn that their leader, whom Paulie killed, was the son of a corrupt city councillor, who vows revenge. Tommy is later ordered to destroy a brothel for switching its loyalties to Morello, and kill an informant working there. Discovering the informant to be Sarah&#x27;s friend Michelle, who needed money to pay for her brother&#x27;s medical care, Tommy begins to question his morality and lets Michelle go. He covers it up and assists Sam on a hit against a witness to the councillor&#x27;s son&#x27;s murder.

In 1933, Morello begins using corrupt police officers to ambush Salieri&#x27;s operations, and gains support from the councillor. Following an ambush on a bootlegging operation, Salieri discovers that Frank has been supplying information on his money laundering activities to the authorities, and reluctantly orders Tommy to kill him. Discovering he was forced to do so for his family&#x27;s safety, Tommy allows Frank to leave the country with his family and again covers it up, before retrieving the evidence against Salieri. Tommy later marries Sarah and they start a family.

In 1935, the Salieri and Morello families begin branching out into new rackets following the end of prohibition. Learning that Salieri is making moves to gain control over law enforcement, Morello attempts to have him killed. After Tommy saves him, Salieri declares open war on his rival. Tommy helps to weaken Morello&#x27;s position by assassinating the councillor, to reduce Morello&#x27;s control over city politics, and Morello&#x27;s brother Sergio, to reduce his control on the port unions. The war comes to an end after Tommy, Paulie and Sam kill Morello himself as he tries to flee the city.

By 1938, the Salieri family is in full control of Lost Heaven&#x27;s rackets and is ruthlessly eliminating anyone who opposes them. When Tommy, Paulie and Sam agree to recover a shipment of impounded cigar crates, they are shocked to discover a stash of diamonds hidden among them. Realizing Salieri was deceiving them, Tommy and Paulie decide to rob a bank without telling Salieri. Although the job is successful, Tommy finds Paulie dead in his apartment the following day and the stolen money missing. Tommy goes to discuss the matter with Sam, who instead reveals Salieri ordered Tommy and Paulie&#x27;s deaths for going behind his back, and that Michelle and Frank were murdered by Salieri&#x27;s men after Tommy&#x27;s past cover-ups were exposed. Tommy survives Sam&#x27;s ambush and kills him, but is forced to go into hiding with his family. Fearing for their safety, he contacts Detective Norman, who has been investigating Salieri, for help.

After relaying his story, Tommy offers to testify against the Salieri family in exchange for a reduced prison sentence and protection for his family. Norman agrees, and the resulting investigation and trials lead to most of the Salieri family, including the Don, being convicted and sentenced. After serving eight years in prison, Tommy is reunited with his family as they are all placed under witness protection and relocated to another city. Years later, Tommy&#x27;s past catches up to him and he is killed on his front lawn by two hitmen on Salieri&#x27;s behalf. The game ends with a monologue narrated by Tommy, explaining how the world really works and lamenting over how he and his friends only wanted the good life but ended up with nothing at all; he concludes that it is important to keep balance in everything, as life can both give and take away.

==Development==
The game had been in development since the end of 1998. It was codenamed &quot;Gangster&quot; and was originally intended to be a driving game similar to &quot;Driver&quot;. Multiplayer modes were also planned and announced during development, but were eventually cut in the final release. The release date was scheduled for 2000. Illusion Softworks initially utilised the engine used in &quot;Hidden and Dangerous&quot; but was replaced by LS3D as the previous engine did not fulfill the developer&#x27;s requirements. Due to the change of the engine, the game was released two years later than planned.

&quot;Mafia&quot; was ported to PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004. Some of the features of the PC version do not exist in the console port, such as police patrols around the city in Free Ride, and some aspects of the game&#x27;s realism and graphics.

The Italian version of the game on PC features alternative artwork.

&quot;Mafia: Special Edition&quot;, released exclusively to the German market and is limited to 5,000 copies. It includes the base game, official Prima strategy guide, replica copy of the Lost Heaven Courier, poster, ball-point pen, notepad, postcard and sticker sheet.

===Story and theme development===
The original cinematic inspirations of &quot;Mafia&quot; were films like &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot;, aiming for a more serious and mature tone for the game. Wanting to create a rich story line, director Daniel Vavra tried to mix drama, action and humour to heighten the game&#x27;s realism. The development team originally intended to put players in the role of a police officer taking on the mafia; this was reversed when Daniel Vavra took in charge of writing the game&#x27;s script.

===Re-release===
&quot;Mafia&quot; was made available for digital download via Steam on September 7, 2010, under the 2K label, but was removed sometime in 2012. A DRM-free re-release of &quot;Mafia&quot; was released on GOG.com in 2017, as well as being reinstated on Steam. The 2017 re-release is essentially unchanged from the original game, albeit lacking the soundtrack due to licensing issues.

==Reception==
&quot;Mafia&quot; was well received by critics upon release as more realistic and serious than a usual &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;-styled game. It was compared to &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; in a positive way, at the time &quot;Game Informer&quot; wrote &quot;This is a lot like &quot;GTA III&quot;. Awesome!&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s no shame in taking a proven gameplay formula and changing it a little bit&quot; in its review. &quot;Mafia&quot; contains a much bigger city to explore than most video games of the time, with multiple forms of available transport in addition to an expansive countryside. Dan Adams of IGN gave the game a rating of 9.2/10, while GameSpot described the PC version as &quot;one of the best games of the year&quot; and rated it at 9.3/10. &quot;Game Informer&quot; compared it favorably to &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, and wrote that &quot;from the living city in which you reside, to the incredibly realistic vehicles, this title has the heart and soul of a blockbuster.&quot;

While the original PC game received widespread acclaim, the versions for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox were considered inferior by many critics, and received lower scores as a result. In the Czech Republic, the country where the game&#x27;s developers come from, the game received universal acclaim from critics. &quot;Mafia&quot; was elected the best video game developed in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in a survey by Czech server BonusWeb when it received 3866 votes out of 13,143 as every reader could choose three games to vote for.

===Awards===

&quot;Mafia&quot; won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Music&quot; award among computer games, and was nominated in the &quot;Best Single-Player Action Game on PC&quot;, &quot;Biggest Surprise&quot;, &quot;Best Sound&quot;, &quot;Best Graphics (Technical)&quot;, &quot;Best Graphics (Artistic)&quot;, &quot;Best Story&quot; and &quot;Game of the Year&quot; categories.

===Sales===
In the United States, &quot;Mafia&quot; debuted in sixth place on the NPD Group&#x27;s weekly sales rankings for computer games, a position it held for another two weeks. It was absent from the weekly charts after four weeks. Ultimately, it was NPD&#x27;s ninth-best-selling computer game of September 2002. In the United Kingdom, the computer version of &quot;Mafia&quot; received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), for sales of at least 100,000 copies. 

&quot;Mafia&quot; had a successful start in the German market, where it premiered as September&#x27;s top-selling full-price computer game, according to Media Control. After one week on German shelves, &quot;Mafia&quot; achieved sales between 40,000 and 50,000 copies. The Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) gave the game a &quot;Gold&quot; certification on November 20, indicating at least 100,000 units sold across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. &quot;Mafia&quot; maintained an unbroken streak in Media Control&#x27;s monthly top 30 through May 2003, by which point its sales in the region totaled roughly 150,000 copies. Despite its early success, &quot;Mafia&quot;″s momentum at retail had declined in the German market by May. This was common for popular action games at the time; distributor Markus Biehl attributed it to widespread illegal copying.

According to Take-Two Interactive, &quot;Mafia&quot; had sold more than 2 million copies worldwide by August 2007.

==Legacy==

A sequel, &quot;Mafia II&quot;, was announced on August 22, 2007, and was released for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on August 24, 2010. The third installment in the series, &quot;Mafia III&quot;, was announced on July 28, 2015, and was released on October 7, 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The fourth installment, &quot;&quot;, which serves as a prequel to the series, was announced on August 20, 2024, and is set to release in 2025 for Windows, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

On May 13, 2020, a remake of &quot;Mafia&quot; was announced by 2K Games, to be titled &quot;&quot;. The remake was the main focus of the &quot;Mafia: Trilogy&quot; collection, which also features a remastered version of &quot;Mafia II&quot; and a version of &quot;Mafia III&quot; comprised with its additional story packs, all developed by Hangar 13. The original &quot;Mafia&quot; was rebuilt from the ground-up, with developers focusing on expanding the storyline, altering the setting to provide a new look to Lost Heaven, doing a major overhaul of the gameplay (including the introduction of motorcycles to the series), and creating a new &quot;original score&quot;. &quot;Mafia: Definitive Edition&quot; was released on September 25, 2020, for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Windows, both individually and as part of the &quot;Mafia: Trilogy&quot;.

<doc id="632846" wikidata="Q545690" url="?curid=632846" title="Gaspard Gourgaud">
<text>Gaspard, Baron Gourgaud (14 September 1783 – 25 July 1852), also known simply as Gaspard Gourgaud, was a French soldier, prominent in the Napoleonic wars.

==Biography==
He was born at Versailles; his father was a musician of the royal chapel. At school he showed talent in mathematical studies and later joined the artillery. In 1802 he became junior lieutenant, and thereafter served with credit in the campaigns of 1803-1805, being wounded at the Battle of Austerlitz. He was present at the siege of Saragossa in 1808, returned to service in Central Europe and took part in nearly all the battles of the Danubian campaign of 1809.

In 1811 he was chosen to inspect and report on the fortifications of Gdańsk. Thereafter he became one of the ordnance officers attached to the emperor, whom he followed closely through the Russian campaign of 1812; he was one of the first to enter the Kremlin and discovered there a quantity of gunpowder which might have been used for the destruction of Napoleon. For his services in this campaign he received the title of baron, and became first ordnance officer. In the campaign of 1813 in Saxony he again showed courage and prowess, especially at Leipzig and Hanau; but it was in the first battle of 1814, near to Brienne, that he rendered the most signal service by killing the leader of a small band of Cossacks who were riding furiously towards Napoleon&#x27;s tent.

Wounded at the Battle of Montmirail, he recovered in time to be involved in several of the conflicts which followed, distinguishing himself especially at Laon and Reims. Though enrolled among the royal guards of King Louis XVIII of France in the summer of 1814, he embraced the cause of Napoleon during the Hundred Days (1815), was named general and &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; by the emperor, and fought at Waterloo.

After the second abdication of the emperor (June 22, 1815), Gourgaud retired with him to Rochefort. It was to Gourgaud that Napoleon entrusted the letter of appeal to George, Prince of Wales and Prince Regent, for asylum in England. Gourgaud set off in HMS &quot;Slaney&quot;, but was not allowed to land in England. Determined to share Napoleon&#x27;s exile, he sailed with him on HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot; to Saint Helena.

His extreme sensitivity and vanity soon brought him into collision with Napoleon&#x27;s other companions, Las Cases and Montholon, in their exile at Longwood. The former he styles in his journal a Jesuit and a scribbler who went there only to become famous. The friction with Montholon, his senior in rank, was so acute that he challenged him to a duel, for which he was sharply rebuked by Napoleon himself. Tiring of the life at Longwood, he decided to leave the island. The comments he made to his English captors helped to convince Hudson Lowe that Napoleon was feigning illness, that he should not be moved from Longwood, and they led indirectly to the expulsion of Napoleon&#x27;s doctor, Barry Edward O&#x27;Meara. Once in London, Gourgaud quickly demonstrated his support for Napoleon by sending letters to the Empress Marie-Louise and to the Emperors of Austria and Russia. In 1840, he joined other survivors of the captivity who returned to St. Helena to bring back Napoleon&#x27;s remains for burial in Paris. He also sharply criticised Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Life of Napoleon&quot;.

He soon published his &quot;Campagne de 1815&quot;, in the preparation of which he had had some help from Napoleon. However, Gourgaud&#x27;s &quot;Journal de Ste-Hélène&quot; was not published till the year 1899. Entering the arena of letters, he wrote, or collaborated in, two well-known critiques. The first was a censure of Count P de Ségur&#x27;s work on the campaign of 1812, with the result that he fought a duel with that officer and wounded him. He became a deputy to the Legislative Assembly in 1849.

==Works==

Gourgaud&#x27;s works are:
*&quot;La Campagne de 1815&quot; (London and Paris, 1818);
*&quot;Napoléon et la Grande Armée en Russie&quot;
*&quot;Examen critique de l&#x27;ouvrage de M. le comte P. de Ségur&quot; (Paris, 1824)
*&quot;Refutation de la vie de Napoleon par Sir Walter Scott&quot; (Paris, 1827)

He collaborated with Montholon in the work entitled &quot;Mémoires pour servir a l&#x27;histoire de France sous Napoleon&quot; (Paris, 1822–1823), and with Belliard and others in the work entitled &quot;Bourrienne et ses erreurs&quot; (2 vols., Paris, 1830). Gourgaud&#x27;s most important work is the &quot;Journal inédit de Ste-Hélène&quot; (2 vols., Paris, 1899), which is a remarkably lifelike record of life in exile at Longwood. See also

<text>The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, or WIPP, in New Mexico, US, is the world&#x27;s third deep geological repository (after Germany&#x27;s Repository for radioactive waste Morsleben and the Schacht Asse II salt mine) licensed to store transuranic radioactive waste for 10,000 years. The storage rooms at the WIPP are 2,150 feet (660 m) underground in a salt formation of the Delaware Basin. The waste is from the research and production of United States nuclear weapons only. The plant started operation in 1999, and the project is estimated to cost $19 billion in total.

It is located approximately east of Carlsbad, in eastern Eddy County, in an area known as the southeastern New Mexico nuclear corridor, which also includes the National Enrichment Facility near Eunice, New Mexico, the Waste Control Specialists low-level waste disposal facility just over the state line near Andrews, Texas, and the International Isotopes, Incorporated facility to be built near Eunice, New Mexico.

Various mishaps at the plant in 2014 brought focus to the problem of what to do with the growing backlog of waste and whether or not WIPP would be a safe repository. The 2014 incidents involved a waste explosion and airborne release of radiological material that exposed 21 plant workers to small doses of radiation that were within safety limits.

==History==
===Geology and site selection===
In 1970, the United States Atomic Energy Commission, later merged into the Department of Energy (DOE), proposed a site in Lyons, Kansas for the isolation and storage of radioactive waste. Ultimately the Lyons site was deemed unusable due to local and regional opposition, and in particular the discovery of unmapped oil and gas wells located in the area. These wells were believed to potentially compromise the ability of the planned facility to contain nuclear waste. In 1973, as a result of these concerns, and because of positive interest from the southern New Mexico community, the DOE relocated the site of the proposed nuclear waste repository, now called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), to the Delaware Basin salt beds located near Carlsbad, New Mexico.

The Delaware Basin is a sedimentary basin formed largely during the Permian Period approximately 250 million years ago. It is one of three sub-basins of the Permian Basin in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico. It contains a thick column of sedimentary rock that includes some of the most oil- and gas-rich rocks in the United States. An ancient shallow sea repeatedly filled the basin and evaporated while the basin slowly subsided, leaving behind a nearly impermeable layer of evaporites, primarily salt, in the Salado and Castile Formations, geologically similar to other basins created by evaporitic inland seas. Over time, the salt beds were covered by an additional of soil and rock. As drilling in the Salado Formation salt beds began in 1975, scientists discovered that at the edge of the basin there had been geological disturbances that had moved interbed layers into a nearly vertical position. In response, the site was moved toward the more stable center of the basin where the Salado Formation salt beds are the thickest and are perfectly horizontal.

Some observers suggested, early in the investigations, that the geological complexity of the basin was problematic, causing the hollowed-out caverns to be unstable. However, what is considered by some to be instability is considered by others to be a positive aspect of salt as a host rock. As early as 1957, the National Academy of Sciences recommended salt for radioactive waste disposal because at depth it would plastically deform, a motion called &quot;salt creep&quot; in the salt-mining industry. This would gradually fill in and seal any openings created by the mining, and in and around the waste.

Exact placement of the construction site in the Delaware Basin changed multiple times due to safety concerns. Brine deposits located below the salt deposits in the Delaware Basin posed a potential safety problem. The brine was first discovered when a 1975 drilling released a pressurized deposit of the liquid from below the repository level. Constructing the plant near one of these deposits could, under specific circumstances, compromise the facility’s safety. The brine could leak into the repository and either dissolve radioactivity or entrain particulate matter with radioactive waste to the surface. The contaminated brine would then need to be cleaned and properly disposed of. There is no drinking water near the site, so possible water pollution is not a concern. After deep drilling multiple times, a final site was selected. The site is located approximately east of Carlsbad.

Waste is placed in rooms underground that have been excavated within a thick salt formation (Salado and Castile Formations) where salt tectonics have been stable for more than 250 million years. Because of plasticity effects, salt will flow to any cracks that develop, a major reason why the area was chosen as a host medium for the WIPP project.

As of March 2022, the WIPP has received 40% of the authorized amount of waste set by the Land Withdrawal Act. More rooms and panels are to be added to accommodate more waste.

===Addressing public concerns via the EEG===
In order to address growing public unrest concerning construction of the WIPP, the New Mexico Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG) was created in 1978. This group, charged with overseeing the WIPP, verified statements, facts, and studies conducted and released by the DOE regarding the facility. The stewardship this group provided effectively lowered public fear and let the facility progress with little public opposition in comparison to similar facilities around the nation such as Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

The EEG, in addition to acting as a check for the government agencies overseeing the project, acted as a valuable advisor. In a 1981 drilling, pressurized brine was again discovered. The site was set to be abandoned when the EEG stepped in and suggested a series of tests on the brine and the surrounding area. These tests were conducted and the results showed that the brine deposit was relatively small and was isolated from other deposits. Drilling in the area was deemed safe due to these results. This saved the project valuable money and time by preventing a drastic relocation.

===Early construction and testing complications===
In 1979, the U.S. Congress authorized construction of the facility. In addition to formal authorization, Congress redefined the level of waste to be stored in the WIPP from high temperature to transuranic, or low level, waste. Transuranic waste often consists of materials which have come in contact with radioactive substances such as plutonium and uranium. This often includes gloves, tools, rags, and assorted machinery often used in the production of nuclear fuel and weapons. Although much less potent than nuclear reactor byproducts, this waste still remains radioactive for approximately 24,000 years. This change in classification led to a decrease in safety parameters for the proposed facility, allowing construction to continue at a faster pace.

The first extensive testing of the facility was due to begin in 1988. The proposed testing procedures involved interring samples of low level waste in the newly constructed caverns. Various structural and environmental tests would then be performed on the facility to verify its integrity and to prove its ability to safely contain nuclear waste. Opposition from various external organizations delayed actual testing into the early 1990s. Attempts at testing were resumed in October 1991 with US Secretary of Energy James Watkins announcing that he would begin transportation of waste to the WIPP.

Despite apparent progress on the facility, construction still remained costly and complicated. Originally conceptualized in the 1970s as a warehouse for waste, the repository now had regulations similar to those of nuclear reactors. As of December 1991, the plant had been under construction for 20 years and was estimated to have cost over one billion dollars (equivalent to $ in dollars). At the time, WIPP officials reported over 28 different organizations claimed authority over operations of the facility.

===Congressional approval===
In November 1991, a federal judge ruled that Congress must approve WIPP before any waste, even for testing purposes, was sent to the facility. This indefinitely delayed testing until Congress gave its approval. The 102nd United States Congress passed legislation allowing use of the WIPP. The U.S. House of Representatives approved the facility on October 6, 1992 and the U.S. Senate passed a bill allowing the opening of the facility on October 8 of the same year. The bill was met with much opposition in the Senate. Senator Richard H. Bryan fought the bill based on safety issues that concerned a similar facility located in Nevada, the state for which he was serving as senator. His efforts almost prevented the bill from passing. New Mexico senators Pete V. Domenici and Jeff Bingaman effectively reassured Senator Bryan that these issues would be addressed in the 103rd Congress. The final legislation provided safety standards requested by the House of Representatives and an expedited timeline requested by the Senate.

The final legislation mandated that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issue revised safety standards for the facility. It also required the EPA to approve testing plans for the facility within ten months. The legislation stated that the security standards mandated in the bill were only applicable to the WIPP in New Mexico and not to other facilities in the United States. This clause caused Senator Bryan to oppose the bill, as he wanted safety standards mandated by the bill to apply to the facility in Nevada as well.

===Testing and final certification===
In 1994, Congress ordered Sandia National Laboratories to begin an extensive evaluation of the facility against the standards set forth by the EPA. Evaluation of the facility continued for four years, resulting in a cumulative total of 25 years of evaluation. In May 1998, the EPA concluded that there was &quot;reasonable expectation&quot; that the facility would contain the vast majority of the waste interred there.

The first nuclear waste arrived to the plant on March 26, 1999. This waste shipment was from Los Alamos National Laboratory, a major nuclear weapons research and development facility located north of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Another shipment followed on April 6 of the same year. These shipments marked the beginning of plant operations. As of December 2010, the plant had received and stored 9,207 shipments () of waste. The majority of this waste was transported to the facility via railroad or truck. The final facility contains a total of 56 storage rooms located approximately underground. Each room is in length. The plant is estimated to continue accepting waste for 25 to 35 years and is estimated to cost a grand total of 19 billion dollars.
===Incidents at the WIPP===
On February 5, 2014 at around 11:00 a.m., a salt haul truck caught fire, prompting an evacuation of the underground facility. Six workers were taken to a local hospital with smoke inhalation and were released by the next day. Lab tests after the fire confirmed that there was zero release of radiological material during, or as a result of, the fire. Underground air-monitoring equipment was out of commission after the truck fire.

In 2020, a subcontractor at the WIPP opened a $32 million lawsuit claiming that &quot;the company that runs the facility breached its contract to rebuild the nuclear waste repository&#x27;s air system.&quot; Due to the 2014 incident, a Texas-based company named Critical Application Alliance LLC was hired to build a new ventilation system. The project was going to fix the flawed design in roof panels, the foundation of the WIPP, and a highly defective control system design.

==== 2014 container explosion ====
On February 15, 2014, authorities ordered workers to shelter in place at the facility after air monitors had detected unusually high radiation levels at 11:30 p.m. the previous day. None of the facility&#x27;s 139 workers were underground at the time of the incident. Later, trace amounts of airborne radiation consisting of americium and plutonium particles were discovered above ground, from the facility. In total, 22 workers were exposed to radioactive contaminants equaling that of a standard chest x-ray. The &quot;Carlsbad Current-Argus&quot; wrote: &quot;the radiation leak occurred on the evening of February 14, according to new information made public at a news conference [on February 20]. Joe Franco, manager of the DOE Carlsbad Field Office, said an underground air monitor detected high levels of alpha and beta radiation activity consistent [with] the waste buried at WIPP.&quot; Regarding the elevated levels of plutonium and americium detected outside the nuclear waste repository, Ryan Flynn, New Mexico Environment Secretary stated during a news conference: &quot;Events like this simply should never occur. From the state&#x27;s perspective, one event is far too many.&quot;

On February 26, 2014, the DOE announced that 13 WIPP above-ground workers had tested positive for exposure to radioactive material. Other employees were in the process of being tested. On Thursday, February 27, DOE announced that it sent out &quot;a letter to tell people in two counties what they do know so far. Officials said it is too early to know what that means for the workers&#x27; health.&quot; Additional testing would be done on employees who were working at the site the day after the leak. Above ground, 182 employees continued to work. A February 27 update included comments on plans to discover what occurred below ground first by using unmanned probes and then people.

The Southwest Research and Information Center released a report on April 15, 2014 that one or more of 258 contact-handled radioactive waste containers located in room 7, panel 7 of the underground repository released radioactive and toxic chemicals. The location of the leak was estimated to be approximately from the air monitor that triggered the contaminants in the filtration system. The contaminants were spread through more than of tunnels, leading to the exhaust shaft into the surrounding above-ground environment. Air-monitoring station #107, located away, detected the radiotoxins. The filter from station #107 was analyzed by the Carlsbad Environmental Monitoring and Research Center (CEMRC) and found to contain 0.64 becquerels (Bq) per cubic meter of air of americium-241 and 0.014 Bq of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240 per cubic meter of air (equivalent to 0.64 and 0.014 radioactive decay events per second per cubic meter of air). The DOE agreed that there was a release of radioactivity from the repository and confirmed that &quot;The event took place starting at 14 February 2014 at 23:14 and continued to 15 February 2014 14:45.&quot; The DOE also confirmed that &quot;A large shift in wind direction can be seen to occur around 8:30 AM on 2/15/14.&quot; The EPA reported on the radiological release on their WIPP News page.

After analysis by CEMRC, the station A filter was found on February 15, 2014 to be contaminated with 4,335.71 Bq of Am-241 per every cubic meter, and 671.61 Bq of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240 per every cubic meter. Bob Alvarez, former DOE official, stated that the long-term ramifications of the WIPP issue are grounded in the fact that the DOE has of transuranic waste that has not been disposed of due to the fact that there are no long-term disposition plans for transuranic waste, including 5 tons of plutonium that are in-situ at the Savannah River Site, as well as water from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State. In an article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Alvarez wrote that &quot;Wastes containing plutonium blew through the WIPP ventilation system, traveling 2,150 feet to the surface, contaminating at least 17 workers, and spreading small amounts of radioactive material into the environment.&quot; The URS Corporation, who oversees WIPP, removed and demoted the contracted manager of the repository. Alvarez ponders the notion of &quot;contract handling&quot; of radioactive waste because it deploys conventional processing practices that do not take into consideration the tens of thousands of containers buried before 1970 at several DOE sites. Alvarez states that the quantity of this pre-1970 plutonium waste is 1,300 times more than the amount permitted to &quot;leak&quot; into the environment at WIPP; however, much of this waste is simply buried a few feet underground at DOE sites.

The source of contamination was later found to be a barrel that exploded on February 14 because contractors at Los Alamos National Laboratory packed it with &quot;organic&quot; cat litter instead of &quot;clay&quot; cat litter. Other barrels with the same problem were then sealed in larger containers. Anthropologist Vincent Ialenti has examined the political, social, and financial triggers to this organic cat litter error in detail, linking it to the accelerated pace of the Department of Energy&#x27;s and State of New Mexico&#x27;s 3706 nuclear waste cleanup campaign, which ran from 2011 to 2014. Ialenti&#x27;s study was published in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in July 2018.

The 2014 incidents raised the question of whether or not WIPP would be a safe replacement for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, as a destination for all waste generated at U.S. commercial nuclear power plants. The cost of the 2014 accident was initially expected to exceed $2 billion and disrupted other programs in various nuclear-industry sites. On January 9, 2017, the plant was formally reopened after three years of cleanup costing $500 million, which is significantly less than forecasted. On April 10, the plant received its first shipment of waste since reopening.

==Climate==
The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is where the highest temperature ever recorded in New Mexico at occurred during the summer of 1994.

==Future ==

Following the interment of waste in the facility, estimated to be sometime between 2025 and 2035 the storage caverns will be collapsed and sealed with 13 layers of concrete and soil. Salt will then seep into and fill the various fissures and cracks surrounding the casks of waste. After approximately 75 years, the waste will be completely isolated from the environment.

The Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository is an unfinished, currently defunct deep geological repository in Nye County, Nevada. In 1987, Congress selected Yucca Mountain to be researched as the potential first permanent repository of nuclear waste, and directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to disregard other proposed sites and study Yucca Mountain exclusively. However, federal funding for the site was terminated in 2011 by amendment to the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, passed on April 14, 2011.

==Criteria==
Waste that is to be disposed of at WIPP must meet certain &quot;waste acceptance criteria&quot;. It accepts transuranic waste generated from DOE activities. The waste must have radioactivity exceeding per gram from TRUs that produce alpha radiation with a half life greater than 20 years. This criterion includes plutonium, uranium, americium, and neptunium among others. The WIPP must not act as a disposal site for any high-level radioactive waste or any nuclear fuel that has already been used. Mixed waste contains both radioactive and hazardous constituents, and WIPP first received mixed waste on September 9, 2000. Mixed waste is joint-regulated by the EPA and the New Mexico Environment Department.

The containers may also contain a limited amount of liquids. The energy released from radioactive materials will dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen (radiolysis). This could then create a potentially explosive environment inside the container. The containers must be vented, as well, to prevent this from happening. All containers must pass a visual inspection that is documented to insure that all containers are in good condition. &quot;Good condition&quot; is described as &quot;not having significant rusting, is of sound and structural integrity, and does not show signs of leakage.&quot;

==Principle==
Waste is placed in rooms underground that have been excavated within a thick salt formation (Salado and Castile Formations) where salt tectonics have been stable for more than 250 million years. Because of plasticity effects, salt and water will flow to any cracks that develop, a major reason why the area was chosen as a host medium for the WIPP project. Because drilling or excavation in the area will be hazardous long after the area is actively used, there are plans to construct markers to deter inadvertent human intrusion for the next ten thousand years.

The Salado Formation is a massive bedded salt deposit (&gt;99% NaCl) that has a simple hydrogeology. Because massive NaCl is somewhat plastic, so holes close under pressure, the rock becomes non-porous by effectively closing pores and fractures. This has a significant effect on the overall hydraulic conductivities (water permeabilities) and molecular diffusion coefficients. These are on the order of ≤10−14 m/s and ≤10−15 m2/s respectively.

==Awareness triggers==

Since 1983, the DOE has been working with linguists, archaeologists, anthropologists, materials scientists, science fiction writers, and futurists to come up with a warning system. For the case of the WIPP, the markers, called &quot;passive institutional controls&quot;, will include an outer perimeter of thirty-two granite pillars built in a four-mile (6 km) square. These pillars will surround an earthen wall, tall and wide. Enclosed within this wall will be another 16 granite pillars. At the center, directly above the waste site, will sit a roofless, granite room providing more information. The team intends to etch warnings and informational messages into the granite slabs and pillars.

This information will be recorded in the six official languages of the United Nations (English, Spanish, Russian, French, Chinese, Arabic) as well as the Native American Navajo language native to the region, with additional space for translation into future languages. Pictograms are also being considered, such as stick figure images and the iconic &quot;The Scream&quot; from Edvard Munch&#x27;s painting. Complete details about the plant will not be stored on site; instead, they would be distributed to archives and libraries around the world. The team plans to submit their final plan to the U.S. Government by around 2028 and they will finalize the warning messages by 2033.

==Underground laboratory==
A portion of the site is used to house underground physics experiments which require shielding from cosmic rays. Although only moderately deep as such laboratories go (1585 meter water equivalent shielding), the site has several advantages. The salt is easy to excavate, dry (no water to pump out), and salt is much lower in naturally occurring radionuclides than rock.

The WIPP plant suffered an accident in February 2014 that forced all scientific activities to cease; for most experiments, it took one to two years to recover, and not all experiments recovered to continue their activities in WIPP. Especially it is unknown whether the Dark Matter Time Projection Chamber collaboration recovered their operations in WIPP after the February 2014 events.

Currently (2018) the WIPP houses the Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) searching for neutrinoless double beta decay. The dark matter experiment collaboration that operated in WIPP before 2014, Dark Matter Time Projection Chamber (DMTPC), is continuing their work and aims to deploy their next detector at SNOLAB. After the 2014 events at the WIPP, the DMTPC experiments were put on hold, but are expected to resume after the building is finished and waste is done being placed in the facility. The detector that the DMTPC collaboration had at WIPP was the 10-L DMTPC prototype detector (with active volume of 10 litres, hence the name 10-L or 10L) which started operations at WIPP October 2010.

Also the EXO collaboration is continuing their activities. The planned end of the EXO operations in WIPP was December 2018, and the collaboration was planning to have the next-stage detector built in SNOLAB. This means that the two biggest experimental infrastructures (EXO and DMTPC) of WIPP intend to relocate to SNOLAB and cease their operations in WIPP before the end of 2019. This would leave the WIPP underground laboratory without any major scientific experiment.

Previous experiments at WIPP include the neutrinoless double beta decay searching MAJORANA Project detectors called Segmented Enriched Germanium Assembly (SEGA) and Multiple Element Germanium Array (MEGA); these were prototype detectors used to develop the measurement apparatus of the collaboration that was deployed in 2004 in WIPP. Since then (2014 onwards), the MAJORANA collaboration has constructed a detector, the MAJORANA Demonstrator, at Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) at Lead, South Dakota. The MAJORANA collaboration remained active (as of 2019) and aimed to construct a large neutrinoless double beta decay experiment LEGEND after the MAJORANA Demonstrator phase.

Some smaller neutrino and dark matter experiments that have been mostly technology development oriented have also taken place at WIPP. There have also been a number of biology experiments in WIPP; for example, these experiments have studied the biological conditions of the deep under ground salt deposit. In one experiment, researchers were able to cultivate bacteria from 250 million year old spores found in WIPP. The Low Background Radiation Experiment studies the effects of reduced radiation environment to biological systems. The Low Background Radiation Experiment was stopped along with all other experiments in February 2014, but continued after summer 2016 at WIPP and has been ongoing since.

The 2000 testing of actinide transport within the Culebra Dolomite from the surrounding area of Carlsbad, New Mexico, was one of many experiments at this location to address concerns for lab safety. Other geology/geophysics experiments have taken place at WIPP, as have some special experiments relating to the operations of the Plant as a repository of radioactive waste.

<doc id="632854" wikidata="Q42852" url="?curid=632854" title="Abdullah Gül">
<text>Abdullah Gül (; ; born 29 October 1950) is a Turkish politician who served as the 11th president of Turkey from 2007 to 2014. He previously served for four months as Prime Minister from 2002 to 2003, and concurrently served as both Deputy Prime Minister and as Foreign Minister between 2003 and 2007. He is currently a member of the Advisory Panel for the President of the Islamic Development Bank.

Advocating staunch Islamist political views during his university years, Gül became a Member of Parliament for Kayseri in 1991 and was re-elected in 1995, 1999, 2002, and 2007. Initially a member of the Islamist Welfare Party, Gül joined the Virtue Party in 1998 after the former was banned for anti-secular activities. When the party split into hardline Islamist and modernist factions in 2000, Gül joined fellow party member Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in advocating the need for reform and moderation. He ran against serving leader Recai Kutan for the Virtue Party leadership at a time when Erdoğan was banned from holding political office. As the candidate for the modernist camp, he came second with 521 votes while Kutan won 633. He co-founded the moderate Justice and Development Party (AKP) with Erdoğan in 2001 after the Virtue Party was shut down in the same year, while hardline conservative members founded the Felicity Party instead.

Gül became prime minister after the AKP won a landslide victory in the 2002 general election while Erdoğan was still banned from office. His government removed Erdoğan&#x27;s political ban by March 2003, after which Erdoğan became an MP for Siirt in a by-election and took over as prime minister. Gül subsequently served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister until 2007. His subsequent bid for the Presidency drew strong and highly vocal opposition from ardent supporters of secularism in Turkey and was initially blocked by the Constitutional Court due to concerns over his Islamist political background. He was eventually elected Turkey&#x27;s first president with a background in Islamic politics after the 2007 snap general election.

As president, Gül came under criticism for giving assent to controversial laws which have been regarded by the political opposition as unconstitutional. In June 2013, he signed a bill restricting alcohol consumption into law despite initially indicating a possible veto, which was seen as a contributing factor to sparking the Gezi Park protests. Other controversies included a law tightening internet regulation in 2013, a law increasing political control over the judiciary in 2014 designed to protect then Prime Minister Erdoğan and others from corruption charges and a law giving the National Intelligence Organization (MİT) controversial new powers also in 2014. Gül took a mediating approach during the Gezi Park anti-government protests and government corruption scandals.

==Early life, education and early career== 
Gül was born in Kayseri, central Anatolia on 29 October 1949, the 26th anniversary of the establishment of the modern Turkish nation, also known as Republic Day in Turkey. His father is Ahmet Hamdi Gül (1926–2017), a retired air force mechanic whilst his mother is Adviye Satoğlu (born 1931).
===Education===
Gül studied Economics at Istanbul University. During his graduate education, he spent two years (1976–1978) in London and studied at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. Returning to Turkey in 1978, he became an instructor in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Sakarya University while working on his doctoral research on Turkey&#x27;s economic relations with other Muslim countries. He received his PhD from Istanbul University in 1983. Between 1983 and 1991, he worked at the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He was conferred an honorary PhD degree from Amity University, Noida on 8 February 2009, and a LL.D from the University of Dhaka on 13 February 2010.

===Entry into politics===
Gül became acquainted with politics early during his high school years. During his university education, he became a member of the Islamist-nationalist &quot;Millî Türk Talebe Birliği&quot; (National Turkish Students&#x27; Union) in the line of Necip Fazıl&#x27;s &quot;Büyük Doğu&quot; (&quot;Grand Orient&quot;) current.

He was elected a member of the Turkish parliament for the &quot;Refah Partisi&quot; (RP, &quot;the Welfare Party&quot;) from the Kayseri electoral district in 1991 and 1995. During these years, he made statements about the political system of Turkey that was designed by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and the Turkish National Movement, which included &quot;This is the end of the republican period&quot; and &quot;The secular system has failed and we definitely want to change it&quot;. These statements caused controversy when his candidacy for the 2007 presidential election was announced by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

In 1999, he kept his seat as a member of the &quot;Fazilet Partisi&quot; (FP, &quot;the Virtue Party&quot;) which was subsequently outlawed by the Constitutional Court for its violation of the Constitution. Its predecessor, the &quot;Refah Partisi&quot;, was also outlawed by the Constitutional Court for its violation of the Constitution, especially the principle of secularism. By this time, Gül had apparently moderated his views and was reportedly considered to be part of the Virtue Party&#x27;s reformist faction. Since 1993 in Ankara, he had been organizing an informal think-tank involving a group of Refah politicians who were discontented with the leadership of Necmettin Erbakan: these included Melih Gökçek, Bülent Arınç, Abdüllatif Şener, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Beşir Atalay. In August 2001, this group founded the &quot;Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi&quot; (Justice and Development Party), a party which billed itself as a moderate conservative party in the European tradition. He was elected once again to represent Kayseri in 2002.

An interview he gave in 2002 summarizes his criticisms of the &quot;Refah Partisi&quot; under the leadership of Necmettin Erbakan and his portrayal of the AKP as a moderate party:In the Welfare Party, there were groups demanding sharia rule. Welfare did not represent the local values we are now cultivating. The ideology of the party was partially shaped by alien imports. [He was referring to the impact of the Islamist ideology of the Iranian Revolution and Arab states on Welfare&#x27;s ideology.] Our vision was at odds with the rest of the party. The despotic rule of Erbakan Hoca made it impossible for us to realize our vision under the rubric of the National View. We believe that modernization and being Muslim complement each other. We accept the modern values of liberalism, human rights, and market economy.

==Prime minister==

After the Justice and Development Party (AKP) won the most votes in the November 2002 general election, Gül was appointed Prime Minister, as AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was still banned from participating in politics. After Gül&#x27;s government secured legislation allowing Erdoğan&#x27;s return to politics, the latter took over as prime minister on 14 March 2003. Gül was appointed deputy prime minister and foreign minister. 

==Foreign minister==
After becoming foreign minister in March 2003, Gül became the key player in Turkey&#x27;s attempts to receive an accession date for the European Union and in its attempts to improve relations with Syria and maintaining its relationship with the Turkic-speaking countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus. On 8 January 2008, Gül flew to the United States to meet with U.S. President George W. Bush and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

==Presidency (2007–2014)==
Prime Minister Erdoğan announced on 24 April 2007 that Gül would be the Justice and Development Party candidate in the 2007 presidential election. Previously, there had been speculation that Erdoğan himself would be the party&#x27;s candidate, which had provoked substantial opposition from secularists. When a boycott of opposition parties in Parliament deadlocked the election process, Gül formally withdrew his candidacy on 6 May 2007. If elected he would be the first president to have been involved with Islamist parties. But a few days later, on 11 May 2007 when he inquired after the alterations to the Turkish constitution which now allowed the people to elect the president directly rather than a parliamentary vote, Gül announced that he was still intending to run.

Following the July 2007 parliamentary election, the AKP renominated Gül as its presidential candidate on 13 August; the election was again held as a vote of parliament. On 14 August, Gül submitted his candidacy application to parliament and expressed his commitment to secularism at a news conference.

On 28 August 2007, he was elected president in the third round of voting; in the first two rounds, a two-thirds majority of MPs had been required, but in the third round he needed only a simple majority. Gül was sworn in immediately thereafter. The process was a very low-key affair.

Gül&#x27;s swearing-in was not attended by the Chief of the Turkish General Staff and was boycotted by the opposition Republican People&#x27;s Party; then the hand-over of power at the presidential palace was held behind closed doors. Gül&#x27;s wife was not present. The traditional evening reception hosted by the new president at the presidential palace for the country&#x27;s highest authorities was announced for 11:30 in the morning and wives were not invited.

His presidency was described as a &quot;new era in Turkish politics&quot;, for being the first president of Turkey with a background in Islamic politics.


Gül received messages of congratulation from the US, EU and German authorities while Turkey&#x27;s prime minister Tayyip Erdoğan made a statement saying &quot;a structure doomed to uncertainty has been overcome&quot;.

In September 2008 Gül became the first Turkish leader to visit Armenia where, in meetings with President Serzh Sarkisian, the two leaders formulated a solution to the tendentious problem of the genocide question, sparking a major debate in Turkey, but both the Armenian and Turkish parliaments refused to ratify the agreement. In November 2011, President Gül led a state visit to the United Kingdom as a guest of Queen Elizabeth II. The President met political and business leaders, visited the Olympic Park and was guest of honor at a state banquet at Buckingham Palace.

In November 2013, Gül called on Muslim countries to fight against what he called Islamophobia during his address at the 29th session of the COMCEC in Istanbul. he said:Islamophobia remains a critical problem, which instigates unsubstantial prejudices against our region and Muslims. Terror plays a role in the persistence of such problems. We have to combat any form of deviation playing into the hands of people who equate terrorism with Islam, the religion of love, tolerance and conciliation.

==Statements on the Middle East==

After the Israeli interdiction on the MV &quot;Mavi Marmara&quot; in 2010, when crewmebers attacked an Israeli naval boarding party, he advocated the complete ending of diplomatic relations with Israel, stating that &quot;Israel will turn into a complete apartheid regime in the next 50 years if it does not allow for the establishment of an independent and proud Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem. That is why we are exerting efforts to achieve a fair peace with a strategic point of view, which is to Israel&#x27;s own interests.&quot; 

On 31 December 2012, he stated with respect to the Arab spring and democratization of the Arab world: &quot;But democracy is not only about elections. The task of creating essential democratic institutions – the rule of law, habits of accountability, gender equality, and freedom of expression and faith – still awaits these countries&quot;.

<doc id="632855" wikidata="Q17153670" url="?curid=632855" title="Reference dose">
<text>A reference dose is the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s maximum acceptable oral dose of a toxic substance, &quot;below which no adverse noncancer health effects should result from a lifetime of exposure&quot;. Reference doses have been most commonly determined for pesticides. The EPA defines an oral reference dose (abbreviated RfD) as:
[A]n estimate, with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude, of a daily oral exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime.

== Definition ==
The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines a reference dose (abbreviated RfD) as the maximum acceptable oral dose of a toxic substance, below which no adverse non cancerous health effects should result from a lifetime of exposure. It is an estimate, with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude, of a daily oral exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime.

== Regulatory status ==
RfDs are no enforceable standards, unlike National Ambient Air Quality Standards. RfDs are risk assessment benchmarks, and the EPA tries to set other regulations, so that people are not exposed to chemicals in amounts that exceed RfDs. According to the EPA from 2008, &quot;[a]n aggregate daily exposure to a [chemical] at or below the RfD (expressed as 100 percent or less of the RfD) is generally considered acceptable by EPA.&quot; States can set their own RfDs.

For example, the EPA set an acute RfD for children of 0.0015 mg/kg/day for the organochlorine insecticide endosulfan, based on neurological effects observed in test animals. The EPA then looked at dietary exposure to endosulfan, and found that for the most exposed 0.1 % of children age 1–6, their daily consumption of the endosulfan exceeded this RfD. To remedy this, the EPA revoked the use of endosulfan on the crops that contributed the most to exposure of children: certain beans, peas, spinach, and grapes.

== Types ==
Reference doses are chemical-specific, &quot;i.e.&quot; the EPA determines a unique reference dose for every substance it evaluates. Often separate acute (0-1 month)and chronic RfDs (more than one month) are determined for the same substance. Reference doses are specific to dietary exposure. When assessing inhalation exposure, EPA uses &quot;reference concentrations&quot; (RfCs), instead of RfDs. Note that RfDs apply only to non-cancer effects. When evaluating carcinogenic effects, the EPA uses the Q1* method.

== Determination ==
RfDs are usually derived from animal studies. Animals (typically rats) are dosed with varying amounts of the substance in question, and the largest dose at which no effects are observed is identified. This dose level is called the No observable effect level, or NOEL. To account for the fact that humans may be more or less susceptible than the test animal, a 10-fold &quot;uncertainty factor&quot; is usually applied to the NOEL. This uncertainty factor is called the &quot;interspecies uncertainty factor&quot; or UFinter. An additional 10-fold uncertainty factor, the &quot;intraspecies uncertainty factor&quot; or UFintra, is usually applied to account for the fact that some humans may be substantially more sensitive to the effects of substances than others. Additional uncertainty factors may also be applied. In general:

:formula_1

Frequently, a &quot;lowest-observed-adverse-effect level&quot; or LOAEL is used in place of a NOEL. If adverse effects are observed at all dose levels tested, then the smallest dose tested, the LOAEL, is used to calculate the RfD. An additional uncertainty factor usually applied in these cases, since the NOAEL, by definition, would be lower than the LOAEL had it been observed. If studies using human subjects are used to determine a RfD, then the interspecies uncertainty factor can be reduced to 1, but generally the 10-fold intraspecies uncertainty factor is retained. Such studies are rare.

== Example ==
As an example, consider the following determination of the RfD for the insecticide chlorpyrifos, adapted from the EPA&#x27;s Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision for chlorpyrifos.

The EPA determined the acute RfD to be 0.005 mg/kg/day based on a study in which male rats were administered a one-time dose of chlorpyrifos and blood cholinesterase activity was monitored. Cholinesterase inhibition was observed at all dose levels tested, the lowest of which was 1.5 mg/kg. This level was thus identified at the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). A NOAEL of 0.5 mg/kg was estimated by dividing the LOAEL by a three-fold uncertainty factor. The NOAEL was then divided by the standard 10-fold inter- and 10-fold intraspecies uncertainty factors to arrive at the RfD of 0.005 mg/kg/day. Other studies showed that fetuses and children are even more sensitive to chlorpyrifos than adults, so the EPA applies an additional ten-fold uncertainty factor to protect that subpopulation. A RfD that has been divided by an additional uncertainty factor that only applies to certain populations is called a &quot;population adjusted dose&quot; or PAD. For chlorpyrifos, the acute PAD (or &quot;aPAD&quot;) is thus 5×10−4 mg/kg/day, and it applies to infants, children, and women who are breast feeding.

The EPA also determined a chronic RfD for chlorpyrifos exposure based on studies in which animals were administered low doses of the pesticide for two years. Cholinesterase inhibition was observed at all dose levels tested, and a NOAEL of 0.03 mg/kg/day estimated by dividing a LOAEL of 0.3 mg/kg/day by an uncertainty factor of 10. As with the acute RfD, the chronic RfD of 3×10−4 mg/kg/day was determined by dividing this NOAEL by the inter- and intraspecies uncertainty factors. The chronic PAD (&quot;cPAD&quot;) of 3×10−5 mg/kg/day was determined by applying an additional 10-fold uncertainty factor to account for the increased susceptibility of infants and children. Like the aPAD, this cPAD applies to infants, children, and breast feeding women.

== Consensus ==
Because the RfD assumes &quot;a dose below which no adverse noncarcinogenic health effects should result from a lifetime of exposure&quot;, the critical step in all chemical risk and regulatory threshold calculations is dependent upon a properly derived dose at which no observed adverse effects (NOAEL) were seen which is then divided by an uncertainty factor that considers inadequacies of the study, animal-to-human extrapolation, sensitive sub-populations, and inadequacies of the database. The RfD that is derived is not always agreed upon. Some may believe it to be overly protective while others may contend that it is not adequately protective of human health.

For example, in 2002 the EPA completed its draft toxicological review of perchlorate and proposed an RfD of 0.00003 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) based primarily on studies that identified neurodevelopmental deficits in rat pups. These deficits were linked to maternal exposure to perchlorate. Subsequently, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reviewed the health implications of perchlorate, and in 2005 proposed a much higher alternative reference dose of 0.0007 mg/kg/day based primarily on a 2002 study by Greer et al. During that study, 37 adult human subjects were split into four exposure groups exposed to 0.007 (7 subjects), 0.02 (10 subjects), 0.1 (10 subjects), and 0.5 (10 subjects) mg/kg/day. Significant decreases in iodide uptake were found in the three highest exposure groups. Iodide uptake was not significantly reduced in the lowest exposed group, but four of the seven subjects in this group experienced inhibited iodide uptake. In 2005, the RfD proposed by NAS was accepted by EPA and added to its integrated risk information system (IRIS).

In a 2005 article in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP), Gary Ginsberg and Deborah Rice argued, that the 2005 NAS RfD was not protective of human health based on the following:

# The NAS report described the level of lowest exposure from Greer &quot;et al.&quot; as a NOEL. However, there was actually an effect at that level although not statistically significant largely due to small size of study population (four of seven subjects showed a slight decrease in iodide uptake).
# Reduced iodide uptake was not considered to be an adverse effect even though it is a precursor to an adverse effect, hypothyroidism. Therefore, additional safety factors, they argued, are necessary when extrapolating from the point of departure to the RfD.
# Consideration of data uncertainty was insufficient because the Greer, &quot;et al.&quot; study reflected only a 14-day exposure ( acute) to healthy adults and no additional safety factors were considered to protect sensitive subpopulations like for example, breastfeeding newborns.

Although there has generally been consensus with the Greer &quot;et al.&quot; study, there is no consensus with regard to developing a perchlorate RfD. One of the key differences results from how the point of departure is viewed (i.e., NOEL or LOAEL), or whether a benchmark dose should be used to derive the RfD. Defining the point of departure as a NOEL or LOAEL has implications when it comes to applying appropriate safety factors to the point of departure to derive the RfD.

In 2010, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection set a 10 fold lower RfD (0.07 μg/kg/day) using a much higher uncertainty factor of 100. They also calculated an Infant drinking water value, which neither US EPA nor CalEPA have done.

<text>The &quot;Fearless&quot;-class landing platform docks were the first purpose-built amphibious assault vessels in the Royal Navy. The class comprised two ships: and .

Designed as landing platform docks (LPD), they were designed to transport and land troops by sea either using Landing Craft Utility (LCU) or helicopters. As constructed, the ships have an internal dock that is accessed via the stern—while in port, vehicles can drive up the stern ramp and into the internal vehicle decks. At sea, the ships could partially submerge themselves at the stern, flooding the internal dock and allowing landing craft to come right up to the edge of the vehicle deck.

Each ship carried four LCUs in the stern dock, with four smaller landing craft on davits on the superstructure. They provided accommodation for up to 400 troops, which could be increased to 700, if no vehicles were carried.

==Service==
&quot;Intrepid&quot; was put into extended reserve in 1991, effectively removing her from active service. While in this state, she was used as a source of spares to maintain &quot;Fearless&quot;. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was finally withdrawn from service in August 1999. &quot;Fearless&quot; was kept in service, and continued to be deployed in concert with until the end of 2002, when she too was withdrawn from service, ready for the to enter the fleet. The &quot;Fearless&quot; class were the last steam-powered surface vessels in Royal Navy service (nuclear submarines use a steam turbine drive).

<text>Tobique—Mactaquac is a federal electoral district in New Brunswick, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1997.

==Political geography==
The district includes the counties of Carleton and Victoria as well as the Parish and Village of Saint-André and the eastern part of the County of York (excluding the City of Fredericton and vicinity). The neighbouring ridings are Madawaska—Restigouche, Miramichi, Fredericton, and New Brunswick Southwest. Across the border to Maine, it neighbours the Maine District 2 of the United States House of Representatives.

The electoral district was created in 1996 from portions of the old ridings of Carleton—Charlotte, Fredericton—York—Sunbury, and Madawaska—Victoria. Its creation was very controversial, as it included areas with both large anglophone and francophone populations, while neighbouring communities were placed in other ridings. This seemingly went against the &quot;communities of interest&quot; criterion in drawing electoral boundaries.

As per the 2012 federal electoral distribution, this riding will gain territory from Fredericton and lose a small territory to the new riding of Miramichi—Grand Lake.

==History==

On two separate occasions Tobique—Mactaquac has been involved in party nomination controversies. In the 1997 election, the Liberals were alleged to have rigged their meeting to choose Pierrette Ringuette, the Member of Parliament for the defunct Madawaska—Victoria riding. The meeting was held in Grand Falls, near her hometown and at the far northern end of the riding. Because of sound problems, only her speech was carried over the loudspeakers. Ringuette-Maltais lost the election to Gilles Bernier of the Progressive Conservatives.

In the 2004 election, the Conservative Party selected Adam Richardson, who had run for the Canadian Alliance in the 2000 election, but the national head office refused to sign his nomination papers, apparently because of Richardson&#x27;s demands that party leader Stephen Harper apologize for allegedly derogatory comments about Atlantic Canadians. The eventual Conservative candidate, Mike Allen, lost to Liberal incumbent Andy Savoy.

===Members of Parliament===
This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<doc id="632862" wikidata="Q1321316" url="?curid=632862" title="Lachlan River">
<text>The Lachlan River (Wiradjuri: &quot;Kalari&quot;, &quot;Galiyarr&quot;) is an intermittent river that is part of the Murrumbidgee catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, located in the Southern Tablelands, Central West, and Riverina regions of New South Wales, Australia.

The Lachlan River is connected to the Murray–Darling basin only when both the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee Rivers are in flood. It is the only river in New South Wales with significant wetlands along its length, rather than just towards its end, including Lake Cowal-Wilbertroy, Lake Cargelligo and Lake Brewster, and nine wetlands of national significance.

== Course ==
The river rises on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range in the Southern Tablelands district of New South Wales, formed by the confluence of Hannans Creek and Mutmutbilly Creek, east of Gunning, and 26 kilometres (16 mi) west of Goulburn. The river flows generally north-west, north, west and south-west, joined by thirty-seven tributaries including the Crookwell, Abercrombie, Boorowa, and Belubula rivers before terminating near Oxley in the Great Cumbung swamp that joins the Murrumbidgee River to the south and becomes part of the Lowbidgee Floodplain. The river descends over its course.

The river is impounded by Wyangala Dam, near Cowra and Brewster Weir, located between Lake Cargelligo and Hillston; and passes through the towns of Breadalbane, Reids Flat, Wyangala, Cowra, Gooloogong, Forbes, Euabalong, Condobolin, Lake Cargelligo, Hillston, Booligal, and Oxley.

The annual flow of the Lachlan is erratic. Annual flows have ranged from less than in 1944 to as much as in 1950. In dry years, the Lachlan can have periods of &quot;zero flow&quot; of over a year (for example from April 1944 to April 1945), which is a complete contrast to the Murray and Murrumbidgee which have not been known to cease to flow since European settlement. The river has flooded every seven years since 1887 at Forbes.

The social-ecological systems of the Lachlan River and its catchment include its upper tablelands, mixed farming slopes, through to plains, rangelands, and then lower floodplains. More than 100,000 people live in the Lachlan catchment. It is estimated that 12% of the state&#x27;s agricultural businesses are located from within the Lachlan River catchment.

==History==

The Lachlan River is located in the traditional homelands of the Wiradjuri Aboriginal people. The Wiradjuri lived along the Macquarie, Lachlan and Murrumbidgee Rivers, in the area known as &quot;the land of the three rivers&quot;.

Acting-Surveyor George William Evans visited the river in 1815, naming it the Lachlan River after Lachlan Macquarie, the governor of the colony of New South Wales. The Lachlan River was substantially explored by John Oxley in 1817. In the early days of colonial New South Wales, the southern part of the Lachlan was known as &quot;Fish River&quot;. It was only after further exploration that it was realised that these two rivers were the same river and the name Fish River was dropped.

The explorer and naturalist, James H B Shaw, was one of the first Europeans to write about the birds and habitat along the Lachlan River. His article appeared in the Australian Town and Country Journal (Sydney, NSW : 1870 – 1907), Saturday 7 March 1885, page 28, 29 http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71024608

==Flooding==
In 1870 the river peaked at at Cowra. Since 1887, the highest flood level at Forbes was in June 1952 when the river peaked at at the Forbes Iron Bridge. More than 900 families were evacuated, with many rescued from roof-tops by boat and helicopter. During the flood in August 1990, 132 houses in Forbes were affected by flood with their yards or their floors covered by water. Floods in 1992 did not reach the same levels at Forbes as in 1990, however, Lachlan Valley farmers lost about 30 percent of their lucerne crops just before harvest. At least 500 sheep were drowned on properties in the Eugowra/Trundle area and most of Eugowra&#x27;s 400 residents were evacuated and some residents from Trundle. Other significant years of floods were: 1891, 1916, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1974, 1976, 1993, 1998, 2012, 2016 and 2021.

==In literature==
The Lachlan River is mentioned in the Banjo Paterson poem &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; as well as the folk song &quot;Streets of Forbes.&quot;

<doc id="632865" wikidata="Q533106" url="?curid=632865" title="Sirens (Savatage album)">
<text>Sirens is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Savatage, released on April 11, 1983. The music on this album is heavier than in later Savatage albums, where the band developed their own style of progressive metal. It has also been cited as a key inspiration for the then-burgeoning thrash metal scene.

According to frontman Jon Oliva, &quot;Sirens&quot; and the EP &quot;The Dungeons Are Calling&quot; were recorded and mixed all in one day. With most of the songs prepared no more than a week before the recording session, the band could only afford one day in the studio. The two albums together were to make Savatage&#x27;s debut but since vinyl records limited the total running time, they were divided. In 2011, they were remastered and released together on the label Earmusic.

The cover of the English versions published by both Music for Nations and Combat Records in 1985 used the cover of the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Borribles Go for Broke&quot;. It was also used by Metal Blade Records for the first edition on CD and other subsequent versions.

==Track listing==


*The track &quot;Out on the Streets&quot; was later re-recorded by the band on their 1986 album, &quot;Fight for the Rock&quot; and an acoustic rendition was recorded by Jon Oliva and included as bonus track in the 2010 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.
*The track &quot;Lady in Disguise&quot; was also later re-recorded for the 1986 album, &quot;Fight for the Rock&quot;, but with different arrangements.
*The track &quot;Scream Murder&quot; was covered on American progressive metal band Vanquishes&#x27; album &quot;Speed Metal Demon&quot;.
* The track &quot;Holocaust&quot; was covered by American death metal band Six Feet Under and is featured on their cover album &quot;Graveyard Classics&quot;.

==Personnel==
In the liner notes for the album the band gave themselves roles instead of listing their instruments:
*Jon Oliva – Shrieks of Terror (lead vocals, synthesizers, keyboards)
*Criss Oliva – Metalaxe (guitars, backing vocals)
*Keith Collins – The Bottom End (bass, backing vocals)
*Steve Wacholz – Barbaric Cannons (drums, percussion)

<doc id="632867" wikidata="Q968153" url="?curid=632867" title="Charles Tristan, marquis de Montholon">
<text>Charles Tristan, Marquis de Montholon (; 21 July 1783 – 21 August 1853) was a French general during the Napoleonic Wars. He chose to go into exile on Saint Helena with the ex-emperor after Napoleon&#x27;s second abdication.

==Early life and career==
Montholon was born in Paris and was trained for a military career from a young age. In his tenth year, he joined the expedition of Admiral Laurent Truguet to the coast of Sardinia. Entering the army in 1797, he rose rapidly and avowed himself, when Chef d&#x27;escadron in Paris at the time of the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Brumaire (November 1799), entirely devoted to Bonaparte.

==War service==
He served in several of the ensuing campaigns, participating in the Battle of Jena (1806) and distinguishing himself at the Battle of Aspern-Essling (May 1809), where he was wounded. At the end of that campaign on the Danube he received the title of count and remained in close attendance on Napoleon, who entrusted him with several important duties. He was chosen for a mission to discuss diplomatic matters with the Austrian commander Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este at Würzburg among others.

At the time of the first abdication of Napoleon at Fontainebleau (11 April 1814), Montholon was one of the few generals who advocated one more attempt to rally the French troops for the overthrow of the Allies.

==In exile with Napoleon==
After the second abdication (22 June 1815), he and his wife, Albine de Montholon, accompanied the Emperor to Rochefort, where Napoleon adopted the proposal, which emanated from Count Las Cases, that he should throw himself on the generosity of the British and surrender to HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. Montholon afterwards, at Plymouth, asserted that the conduct of Captain Maitland of the &quot;Bellerophon&quot; had been altogether honourable, and that the responsibility for the failure must rest largely with Las Cases.

Montholon and his wife accompanied the ex-Emperor to Saint Helena. Napoleon chiefly dictated to Montholon the notes on his career which form a far-from-trustworthy commentary on the events of the first part of his life. Montholon is known to have despised and flouted Las Cases, though in later writings he affected to laud his services to Napoleon. With Gourgaud, who was no less vain and sensitive than he himself, there was a standing feud which would have led to a duel but for the express prohibition of Napoleon.
Las Cases left the island in November 1816, and Gourgaud in January 1818; but Montholon, despite the departure of his wife, stayed on at Longwood to the end of the former Emperor&#x27;s life (May 1821).

Montholon had to spend many years in what is now Belgium, and in 1840 acted as &quot;chief of staff&quot; in the absurd &quot;expedition&quot; conducted by Louis Napoleon from London to Boulogne. He was condemned to imprisonment at Ham, but was released in 1847 thanks to the efforts of Gourgaud, who was then in favour with the administration; he then retired to England and published &quot;Récits de la captivité de l&#x27;Empereur Napoléon à Sainte-Hélène&quot;. In 1849 he became one of the deputies for the Legislative Assembly under the Second French Republic. He lived to see the establishment of the Second French Empire in 1852.

Those who believe that Napoleon was murdered by poisoning now regard Montholon as the most likely suspect. This accusation has been forcefully argued by Ben Weider and Sten Forshufvud, and accepted by Napoleon&#x27;s recent biographer, Alan Schom.

==Doubts on military service==
Montholon&#x27;s military service ultimately enabled him to join Napoleon in the Emperor&#x27;s final exile. However, closer scrutiny of his military service reveals several falsehoods.

Montholon claimed he had won a sword of honour during the 1800s Hohenlinden campaign. But in fact he had no part in the campaign, as he was facing expulsion from the army for corruption at the time. He was reintegrated into the army thanks to influential friends and family, including his brother-in-law, Marshal Macdonald.

In 1809, Montholon claimed to be wounded at the Battle of Jena, an event which his commanding officer swore in a later affidavit did not happen.
As well, during Napoleon&#x27;s first exile in 1814, Montholon lost his commission under the Royalists after only seven days, after he was charged with taking money meant to pay his troops in Clermont-Ferrand.

Of Montholon&#x27;s own writings, the only one of note is &quot;De l&#x27;Armée française&quot; (1834).

== Family ==
Montholon married Albine Vassal on 2 July 1812, two months after she divorced her second husband, Daniel Roger. Their son, Charles-François-Frédéric, was born in 1814. Montholon probably fathered her two other sons while she was married to Roger, as she gave each the names &quot;Charles&quot;, &quot;Tristan&quot;, and &quot;de Montholon-Sémonville&quot;. Their daughter, Hélène, born on Saint Helena in 1816, may have been fathered by Napoleon.

He fathered another son, Charles Jean Tristan (1843–1899) by his mistress, Catherine O&#x27;Hara. They married sometime after Albine&#x27;s death in 1848.

Charles Jean Tristan married Paolina Fe d&#x27;Ostiani and lived in the Palais Simoni Fè in Bienno, Italy. He disappeared after a fatal hunting accident, and his wife died in Brescia, Italy. Before leaving their palace, in 1935 they let the inferior floors to the Panteghini family &quot;ad vitam eternam&quot;. Their children donated it to the city of Bienno in 1988, and the palace is now the city library and a cultural centre.

== In popular culture ==
*Nigel Terry portrayed Montholon in the 2001 film &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, which was based on the novel &quot;The Death of Napoleon&quot;, written by Simon Leys.

<doc id="632868" wikidata="Q5482173" url="?curid=632868" title="Francis Perceval Eliot">
<text>Francis Perceval Eliot (September 1755 – 23 August 1818) was an English soldier, auditor, and man of letters. In 1814 he succeeded his half-brother as Count Eliot, however he did not feel it was proper to assume the title.

==Life==
Eliot was the son of General Granville Elliott (1713–1759) and his second wife, Elizabeth Duckett (1724–1804). He was born at Kew Green, Richmond-upon-Thames, Surrey, and baptised on 9 October 1755 at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew Green.

Following his father&#x27;s death on 10 October 1759, the family moved on 15 April 1760 to Richmond. In 1762, Francis lodged at Hargreaves in St Martin&#x27;s Lane, London. On 17 April 1764, he lodged with Mrs Bathurst, Charterhouse Square and attended the public school of St Bartholomew. In 1770, he went to Mrs Betesworth&#x27;s Academy in Kingston, near Portsmouth, Hampshire, leaving in 1772 to join Mr Lockee&#x27;s Military Academy, Little Chelsea, London, and later to Colonel Gallatin&#x27;s School of Equitation for 7 months.

On 15 December 1773 he was commissioned as an ensign in the 14th Regiment of Foot. On 28 March 1774 he joined his regiment, moving to quarters in Dover on 13 May 1774. In March 1775 he left for America, where, on 25 August 1775, he was promoted to lieutenant in the 14th Foot. By 28 November 1778, he had returned to St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London, where he married Anne Breynton ( 1756 – 15 August 1829), the daughter of the famous minister in Nova Scotia, Rev Dr John Breynton ( 1719–1799). In 1790, he bought Elmhurst Hall and various other properties in Staffordshire, while still maintaining a house in London. In 1794 he raised the Staffordshire Yeomanry Cavalry and was appointed its major and commander of the Lichfield Troop on 20 September. He left the regiment when he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the new 3rd Staffordshire Militia on 25 April 1798. He was promoted to colonel on 15 January 1799, but the regiment was disbanded later that year. On 28 June 1803 he was appointed colonel of a new 2nd Staffordshire Militia, but this was also disbanded in 1805.

In 1797, he tried to sell off his Staffordshire estates and by 1800 he had moved to Lichfield. In 1806, he finally disposed of his Staffordshire properties, pulling down the derelict Elmhurst Hall. He moved back to London full-time, and took an oath as a Commissioner of Public Accounts, based at Somerset House in the Strand. Around this time he became a man of letters, addressing the foremost politicians of the time, while also writing for a magazine – The Aegis. The next year, he attempted to be elected as MP for Westminster in the 1807 United Kingdom general election. On Friday 8 May 1807, he attended a meeting at Covent Garden, London where he was introduced to the meeting, by Col. Robinson who at that time commanded London Recruiting District, and the Pimlico battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Loyal Volunteers from about 1803. His election was unsuccessful and he returned to his literary pursuits.

<text>Cowra () is a town in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. It is the largest population centre and the council seat for the Cowra Shire, with a population of 9,863.

Cowra is located approximately above sea level, on the banks of the Lachlan River, in the Lachlan Valley. By road it is approximately west of the state capital, Sydney, and north of the nation&#x27;s capital, Canberra. The town is situated at the intersection of three state highways: the Mid-Western Highway, Olympic Highway, and the Lachlan Valley Way.

Cowra is included in the rainfall recorder and weather forecast region for the Central West Slopes and Plains division of the Bureau of Meteorology forecasts.

==History==
The first European explorer to the area, George William Evans, entered the Lachlan Valley in 1815. He named the area the Oxley Plains after his superior the surveyor-general, John Oxley. In 1817 he deemed the area &quot;rather unfit for settlement&quot;. A military depot was established not long after at Soldiers Flat near present-day Billimari. Arthur Ranken and James Sloan, from Bathurst, were amongst the first white settlers on the Lachlan. They moved to the area in 1831.

The township of &quot;Coura Rocks&quot; had its beginnings in 1844. Around 1847, the township site became known as Cowra, and in 1849, was proclaimed a village.

In the 1850s many gold prospectors passed through headed for gold fields at Lambing Flat (Young) and Grenfell. The first school was established in 1857. The first bridge over the Lachlan River was built in 1870. Gold was discovered at Mount McDonald in the 1880s. The rail head from Sydney reached Cowra in 1886. Local government was granted in 1888. The first mobile telephone exchange was established in 1901. The town water supply was established in 1909, the gasworks in 1912 and town supplied electricity was introduced in 1924. From 1904 to 1966 the Cowra Experiment Farm was im operation, experimenting with wheat and with fallow crops.

Cowra hosts an annual Festival of International Understanding, featuring a parade, a fireworks display, balloons for the kids and events showcasing a particular foreign culture. In 2020 it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Cowra prisoner of war camp===
During World War II, Cowra was the site of a prisoner of war (POW) camp. Most of the detainees were captured Japanese and Italian military personnel. However, in July 1942, Indonesian political prisoners from the Dutch Tanahmerah prison on the Digul river, in West Papua, were transported as &quot;prisoners-of-war&quot; to the Cowra prison camp, at the behest of Netherlands East Indies government-in-exile (with others who were ill being sent to Liverpool). These Indonesian prisoners arrived in mid 1942 and were released on 7 December 1943, and subsequent to their release, played an important role in the black bans which effectively frustrated the Dutch reimposition of colonial rule in the Indies.)

====The Cowra breakout====
On 5 August 1944, at least 545 Japanese POWs attempted a mass breakout from the camp. Simultaneously, other Japanese prisoners committed suicide, or were killed by their countrymen, inside the camp.

The actions of the POWs in storming machine gun posts, armed only with improvised weapons, showed what Prime Minister John Curtin described as a &quot;suicidal disregard of life&quot;.

During the breakout and subsequent recapture of POWs, four Australian guards and 231 Japanese died, and 108 prisoners were wounded. The dead Japanese were buried in Cowra in the specially created Japanese War Cemetery. This is the only such cemetery in Australia, and also holds some of the dead from the World War II air raids on Darwin.

An Avenue of Honour also commemorates those who died in World War I. There is an annual ceremony to commemorate the breakout, involving local school students, council members, local dignitaries and guest Japanese visitors.

==Japanese War Cemetery==
A cemetery was initially created holding the 231 prisoners who died in the Cowra Breakout and was tended by members of the Cowra RSL after World War II. The site is next to the Australian War Cemetery, which houses local servicemen, personnel who died in the area, and four of the guards of the Cowra breakout. There are also a few Indonesian prisoner graves of people who were detained by the Dutch authorities.

Formalisation of the site as an official war grave began in 1959 and the site opened as the Japanese War Cemetery on 22 November 1964. Eventually, 524 bodies were interred there, including civilian internees and all other Japanese combatants who were buried in other parts of Australia (since their graves were later moved there). Not all dead were Japanese nationals, but include 25 Taiwanese and 1 Korean (which at the time were colonies of Japan).

The cemetery is on Crown land owned by the New South Wales government under trusteeship of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Use of the land, was granted to Japan in 1963 on a payment-of-costs basis. In 1971, the Cowra Tourism Development decided to celebrate this link to Japan, and proposed a Japanese garden for the town. The Japanese government agreed to support this development as a sign of thanks for the respectful treatment of their war dead; the development also received funding from the Australian government and private entities.

== Japanese Garden ==
Located 3 kilometres south of the war cemetery is the Cowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre. It was designed in 1977 by Ken Nakajima (1914–2000), a &quot;world renowned architect&quot; of Japanese gardens at the time. The first stage was opened in 1979, with a second stage opened in 1986. The gardens were designed in the style of the Edo period and are a &quot;komatsu&quot; (&quot;small pine-tree&quot;) or strolling garden. The rocky hillside, manicured hedges, waterfalls and streams, and the two lakes provide a serene environment for a myriad of birdlife. Special features of the garden include a Bonsho Bell, a traditional Edo Cottage, an authentic open air Tea House and a Bonsai House. They are designed to show &#x27;A Sense of Season&#x27; throughout the year as well as represetative landscape types of Japan. At five hectares (12 acres), the garden is the largest Japanese garden in the Southern Hemisphere. They were added to the National Trust Register in June 2013.

After cherry trees were planted in 1988, an annual &quot;Sakura Matsuri&quot; (cherry blossom festival) was first held in 1990 and is an event in Cowra&#x27;s tourism calendar and is held in the gardens during September. The festival celebrates the birth of spring. Locals, Australian and international visitors alike have the opportunity to experience traditional elements of Japanese culture. &quot;Sakura&quot; at the Cowra Japanese Garden is celebrated annually when the cherry blossoms are at their peak.

<doc id="632872" wikidata="Q1039797" url="?curid=632872" title="Power of the Night">
<text>Power of the Night is the second studio album by the American heavy metal band Savatage, released in 1985. This record was produced by Max Norman, who later went on to produce Megadeth&#x27;s 1992 hit album &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;.

The record was not originally pressed with a Parental Advisory sticker on the cover. However, Atlantic Records did have a problem with some of the sexual metaphors mentioned in &quot;Hard for Love&quot; and &quot;Skull Session.&quot; It was also a marketing ploy to encourage more people to buy the record as a result of it being &quot;banned&quot; by some outlets.

This was bassist Keith Collins&#x27;s last album with the band. Jon and Criss Oliva were not completely happy with Collins&#x27; playing and corrected some of his mistakes for the final version. Collins was replaced by Johnny Lee Middleton in 1986.

<doc id="632874" wikidata="Q1009245" url="?curid=632874" title="Genotoxicity">
<text>Genotoxicity is the property of chemical agents that damage the genetic information within a cell causing mutations, which may lead to cancer. While genotoxicity is often confused with mutagenicity, all mutagens are genotoxic, but some genotoxic substances are not mutagenic. The alteration can have direct or indirect effects on the DNA: the induction of mutations, mistimed event activation, and direct DNA damage leading to mutations. The permanent, heritable changes can affect either somatic cells of the organism or germ cells to be passed on to future generations. Cells prevent expression of the genotoxic mutation by either DNA repair or apoptosis; however, the damage may not always be fixed leading to mutagenesis.

To assay for genotoxic molecules, researchers assay for DNA damage in cells exposed to the toxic substrates. This DNA damage can be in the form of single- and double-strand breaks, loss of excision repair, cross-linking, alkali-labile sites, point mutations, and structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations. The compromised integrity of the genetic material has been known to cause cancer. As a consequence, many sophisticated techniques including Ames Assay, &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; Toxicology Tests, and Comet Assay have been developed to assess the chemicals&#x27; potential to cause DNA damage that may lead to cancer.

==Mechanism==
Genotoxic substances induce damage to the genetic material in the cells through interactions with the DNA sequence and structure. For example, the transition metal chromium interacts with DNA in its high-valent oxidation state, incurring DNA lesions which lead to carcinogenesis. The metastable oxidation state Cr(V) is achieved through reductive activation. Researchers performed an experiment to study the interaction between DNA with the carcinogenic chromium by using a Cr(V)-Salen complex at the specific oxidation state. The interaction was specific to the guanine nucleotide in the genetic sequence. In order to narrow the interaction between the Cr(V)-Salen complex with the guanine base, the researchers modified the bases to 8-oxo-G so to have site specific oxidation. The reaction between the two molecules caused DNA lesions; the two lesions observed at the modified base site were guanidinohydantoin and spiroiminodihydantoin. To further analyze the site of lesion, it was observed that polymerase stopped at the site and adenine was inappropriately incorporated into the DNA sequence opposite of the 8-oxo-G base. Therefore, these lesions predominately contain G→T transversions. High-valent chromium is seen to act as a carcinogen as researchers found that &quot;the mechanism of damage and base oxidation products for the interaction between high-valent chromium and DNA... are relevant to &quot;in vivo&quot; formation of DNA damage leading to cancer in chromate-exposed human populations&quot;. Consequently, it shows how high-valent chromium can act as a carcinogen with 8-oxo-G forming xenobiotics.

Another example of a genotoxic substance causing DNA damage are pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). These substances are found mainly in plant species and are poisonous to animals, including humans; about half of them have been identified as genotoxic and many as tumorigenic. The researchers concluded from testing that when metabolically activated, &quot;PAs produce DNA adducts, DNA cross-linking, DNA breaks, sister chromatid exchange, micronuclei, chromosomal aberrations, gene mutations, and chromosome mutations &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot;.&quot; The most common mutation within the genes are G:C → T:A tranversions and tandem base substitution. The pyrrolizidine alkaloids are mutagenic &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot; and, therefore, responsible for the carcinogenesis prominently in the liver. Comfrey is an example of a plant species that contains fourteen different PAs. The active metabolites interact with DNA to cause DNA damage, mutation induction, and cancer development in liver endothelial cells and hepatocytes. The researchers discovered in the end that the &quot;comfrey is mutagenic in liver, and PA contained in comfrey appear to be responsible for comfrey-induced toxicity and tumor induction,&quot;.

==Test techniques==

The purpose of genotoxicity testing is to determine if a substrate will influence genetic material or may cause cancer. They can be performed in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells. With the knowledge from the tests, one can control early development of vulnerable organisms to genotoxic substances.

===Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay===

The Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay, also known as the Ames Assay, is used in laboratories to test for gene mutation. The technique uses many different bacterial strains in order to compare the different changes in the genetic material. The result of the test detects the majority of genotoxic carcinogens and genetic changes; the types of mutations detected are frame shifts and base substitutions.

==&quot;in vitro&quot; toxicology testing==
The purpose of &quot;in vitro&quot; testing is to determine whether a substrate, product, or environmental factor induces genetic damage. One technique entails cytogenetic assays using different mammalian cells. The types of aberrations detected in cells affected by a genotoxic substance are chromatid and chromosome gaps, chromosome breaks, chromatid deletions, fragmentation, translocation, complex rearrangements, and many more. The clastogenic or aneugenic effects from the genotoxic damage will cause an increase in frequency of structural or numerical aberrations of the genetic material. This is similar to the micronucleus test and chromosome aberration assay, which detect structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells.

In a specific mammalian tissue, one can perform a mouse lymphoma TK+/- assay to test for changes in the genetic material. Gene mutations are commonly point mutations, altering only one base within the genetic sequence to alter the ensuing transcript and amino acid sequence; these point mutations include base substitutions, deletions, frame-shifts, and rearrangements. Also, chromosomes&#x27; integrity may be altered through chromosome loss and clastogenic lesions causing multiple gene and multilocus deletions. The specific type of damage is determined by the size of the colonies, distinguishing between genetic mutations (mutagens) and chromosomal aberrations (clastogens).

The SOS/umu assay test evaluates the ability of a substance to induce DNA damage; it is based on the alterations in the induction of the SOS response due to DNA damage. The benefits of this technique are that it is a fast and simple method and convenient for numerous substances. These techniques are performed on water and wastewater in the environment.

===&quot;in vivo&quot; testing===
The purpose for &quot;in vivo&quot; testing is to determine the potential of DNA damage that can affect chromosomal structure or disturb the mitotic apparatus that changes chromosome number; the factors that could influence the genotoxicity are ADME and DNA repair. It can also detect genotoxic agents missed in &quot;in vitro&quot; tests. The positive result of induced chromosomal damage is an increase in frequency of micronucelated PCEs. A micronucleus is a small structure separate from the nucleus containing nuclear DNA arisen from DNA fragments or whole chromosomes that were not incorporated in the daughter cell during mitosis. Causes for this structure are mitotic loss of acentric chromosomal fragments (clastogenicity), mechanical problems from chromosomal breakage and exchange, mitotic loss of chromosomes (aneugenicity), and apoptosis. The micronucleus test &quot;in vivo&quot; is similar to the &quot;in vitro&quot; one because it tests for structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, especially in rats&#x27; blood cells.

===Comet assay===

Comet assays are one of the most common tests for genotoxicity. The technique involves lysing cells using detergents and salts. The DNA released from the lysed cell is electrophoresed in an agarose gel under neutral pH conditions. Cells containing DNA with an increased number of double-strand breaks will migrate more quickly to the anode. This technique is advantageous in that it detects low levels of DNA damage, requires only a very small number of cells, is cheaper than many techniques, is easy to execute, and quickly displays results. However, it does not identify the mechanism underlying the genotoxic effect or the exact chemical or chemical component causing the breaks.

==Cancer==
Genotoxic effects such as deletions, breaks and/or rearrangements can lead to cancer if the damage does not immediately lead to cell death. Regions sensitive to breakage, called fragile sites, may result from genotoxic agents (such as pesticides). Some chemicals have the ability to induce fragile sites in regions of the chromosome where oncogenes are present, which could lead to carcinogenic effects. In keeping with this finding, occupational exposure to some mixtures of pesticides are positively correlated with increased genotoxic damage in the exposed individuals. DNA damage is not uniform in its severity across populations because Individuals vary in their ability to activate or detoxify genotoxic substances, which leads to variability in the incidence of cancer among individuals. The difference in ability to detoxify certain compounds is due to individuals&#x27; inherited polymorphisms of genes involved in the metabolism of the chemical. Differences may also be attributed to individual variation in efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms

The metabolism of some chemicals results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is a possible mechanism of genotoxicity. This is seen in the metabolism of arsenic, which produces hydroxyl radicals, which are known to cause genotoxic effects. Similarly, ROS have been implicated in genotoxicity caused by particles and fibers. Genotoxicity of nonfibrous and fibrous particles is characterized by high production of ROS from inflammatory cells.

===Genotoxins implicated in the four most common cancers worldwide===
Major genotoxic agents responsible for the four most common cancers worldwide (lung, breast, colon and stomach) have been identified.
Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer in the world, both in terms of yearly cases (1.61 million cases; 12.7% of all cancer cases) and deaths (1.38 million deaths; 18.2% of all cancer deaths). Tobacco smoke is the main cause of lung cancer. Risk estimates for lung cancer indicate that tobacco smoke is responsible for 90% of lung cancers in the United States. Tobacco smoke contains more than 5,300 identified chemicals. The most significant carcinogens in tobacco smoke have been determined by a &quot;Margin of Exposure&quot; approach. By this approach, the tumorigenic compounds in tobacco smoke were, in order of importance, acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide, and isoprene. In general, these compounds are genotoxic and cause DNA damage. As examples, DNA damaging effects have been reported for acrolein, formaldehyde, and acrylonitrile.
Breast cancer is the second most frequent cancer worldwide on a yearly basis [(1.38 million cases, 10.9% of all cancer cases), and ranks 5th as cause of death (458,000, 6.1% of all cancer deaths)]. Breast cancer risk is associated with persistently high blood levels of estrogen. Estrogen likely contributes to breast carcinogenesis by the following three processes; (1) metabolic conversion of estrogen to genotoxic, mutagenic carcinogens, (2) stimulation of growth of tissues, and (3) repression of phase II detoxification enzymes that metabolize genotoxic reactive oxygen species, thus resulting in increased oxidative DNA damage. The principal human estrogen, estradiol, can be metabolized to quinone derivatives that form DNA adducts. These derivatives can cause the removal of bases from the phosphodiester backbone of DNA (e.g. depurination). This removal may be followed by inaccurate repair or replication of the apurinic site leading to mutation and eventually cancer.
Colorectal cancer is the third most frequent cancer worldwide [1.23 million cases (9.7% of all cancer cases), 608,000 deaths (8.0% of all cancer deaths)]. In the United States, tobacco smoke may be responsible for up to 20% of colorectal cancers. In addition, bile acids are implicated by substantial evidence as an important genotoxic factor in colon cancer. In particular, the bile acid deoxycholic acid acid causes the production of DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species in human and rodent colon epithelial cells.
Stomach cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide [990,000 cases (7.8% of all cancer cases), 738,000 deaths (9.7% of all cancer deaths )]. Infection by &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is the main causative factor in stomach cancer. Chronic inflammation due to &quot;H. pylori&quot;, if untreated, is often long-standing. &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection of gastric epithelial cells causes increased production of genotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS cause oxidative damage to DNA that includes the major base alteration 8-Oxo-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine. In a recent retrospective study it was found that use of a bile acid sequestrant was associated with a significant reduction in gastric cancer risk, suggesting that bile acids may be a contributory factor in stomach cancer.

===Genotoxic chemotherapy===
Genotoxic chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with the use of one or more genotoxic drugs. The treatment is traditionally part of standardized regime. By utilizing the destructive properties of genotoxins treatments aims to induce DNA damage into cancer cells. Any damage done to a cancer is passed on to descendent cancer cells as proliferation continues. If this damage is severe enough, it will induce cells to undergo apoptosis.

====Risks====
A drawback of treatment is that many genotoxic drugs are effective on cancerous cells and normal cells alike. Selectivity of a particular drug&#x27;s action is based on the sensitivity of the cells themselves. So, while rapidly dividing cancer cells are particularly sensitive to many drug treatments, often normal functioning cells are affected.

Another risk of treatment is that, in addition to being genotoxic, many of the drugs are also mutagenic and cytotoxic. So the effects of these drugs are not limited to just DNA damage. In addition, some of these drugs that are meant to treat cancers are also carcinogens themselves, raising the risk of secondary cancers, such as leukemia.

====Different treatments====
This table depicts different genotoxic-based cancer treatments along with examples.

===Kidney===

Genotoxic DNA damage in the kidney has been implicated in both acute and chronic kidney injury, as well as in renal cell carcinoma. Studies of humans with genetic deficiencies in DNA repair pathways have revealed that their kidneys are particularly vulnerable to DNA damages such as DNA crosslinks, DNA breaks and transcription-blocking damage.

<text>The Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art (abbreviated as the PDF) held a collection of Chinese ceramics and related items assembled by Percival David that are on permanent display in a dedicated gallery in Room 95 at the British Museum. The foundation&#x27;s main purpose is to promote the study and teaching of Chinese art and culture. The collection has some 1,700 pieces, mostly of Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasty porcelain from the 10th century to the 18th. It includes a painting, &quot;Scroll of Antiquities&quot; ( , 1728, Yongzheng&#x27;s reign).

The collection concentrates on pieces in the &quot;Chinese taste&quot; rather than export ware, and on Imperial porcelain, much of it Jingdezhen ware. It includes examples of the rare Ru and Guan wares and two important Yuan dynasty blue and white porcelain temple vases (the &quot;David Vases&quot;), the oldest dated blue and white porcelain pieces, from 1351. The Foundation also has a large library of Western and East Asian books related to Chinese art; this and archival material are housed in the library of School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London.

In 1950, the collection was presented to the University of London by Sir Percival David. It was displayed in a house at 53 Gordon Square and used as a focus for the teaching of Chinese art and culture at SOAS. The collection has been on display in a special room at the British Museum since 2009. In November 2024, it was announced that the collection would be donated to the British Museum by the trustees of the Sir Percival David Foundation.

==History==

Percival David started collecting Chinese art some time around 1913, and he continued to do so until his death in 1964. He first visited China in 1923, and there he gained an appreciation of Chinese ceramics. In 1925 he helped finance and mount an exhibition of many of the best items of the imperial collection in the Forbidden City in Beijing. In 1927, he acquired some items that were originally from the Forbidden City when they came onto the market. Many of these items were sold off by members of the Imperial Household Department during the late Qing dynasty, and Empress Dowager Cixi allegedly used these items as collateral for loans from the Yuin Yeh Bank in 1901. David managed to buy some forty pieces one way or the other and export them to the United Kingdom. In 1930, he again returned to China and helped with various exhibitions and produced a series of catalogues of the pieces. However, much of the acquisition history of David&#x27;s collection was unrecorded, but he may have acquired many of the items through various dealers, auctions and other collectors. The Yuan dynasty &#x27;David Vases&#x27; in the collection were acquired from two separate sources. Many pieces were likely once owned by the Qing dynasty emperors, and several pieces have inscriptions added on the orders of the Qianlong Emperor (1736–95). The pieces assembled by Percival David form the most important single collection of Chinese ceramics outside of China and Taiwan.

In 1931, David&#x27;s collection was displayed in the Dorchester Hotel in London. It remained there until it was evacuated to the countryside during World War II. David also created a Chair in Chinese Art and Architecture at the Courtauld Institute of Art, which is part of the University of London. Towards the end of his life, he was determined to keep the collection together, and to this end entered negotiations with the University of London. An agreement was reached to keep the collection and the library together in a foundation attached to SOAS.

The chair that David had created was also moved to SOAS. Previous holders of the chair, called the Percival David Professor of Chinese and East Asian Art, include William Watson, Roderick Whitfield and Craig Clunas. The incumbent in 2015 was Shane McCausland. The collection was opened to the public on 10 June 1952 in a house at 53 Gordon Square, Bloomsbury.

The foundation has lent many of its pieces to other countries. It lent many items of Yuan dynasty porcelain to Venice&#x27;s 700th-anniversary celebration of Marco Polo&#x27;s expedition. It has also sent other items to places as far away as Japan and the United States.

The library collection was a working library, open to researchers from around the world, and is now accessible through SOAS.

==Relocation==
Due to a funding crisis, 53 Gordon Square closed at the end of 2007. The ceramics collection went on a long-term loan to the British Museum, where the whole collection, about 1,700 objects, is on permanent public display in a specially designed gallery (Room 95, British Museum) opened on 23 April 2009, sponsored by Sir Joseph Hotung. The public gallery is part of the Sir Joseph Hotung Centre for Ceramic Studies, which includes facilities to use the collection for teaching.

&quot;Chinese Ceramics: Highlights of the Sir Percival David Collection&quot;, by Regina Krahl and Jessica Harrison-Hall, was published in April 2009 by the British Museum Press to coincide with the opening of the new display.

In November 2024, it was announced that the collection of 1,700 objects would be donated to the British Museum. Some items of the collection would be lent to the Shanghai Museum in China and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York after the donation has been completed.

==Collection==
David focused his collection of Chinese ceramics on stonewares and porcelain from the 10th to the 18th centuries (Song to Qing dynasties), with a few earlier pieces from the Six Dynasties to the Tang. The earliest piece in the collection dates from the third-century Western Jin. There are no pieces from the earlier periods of Chinese history because David chose not to collect any Chinese earthenware; the development of earthenware is found all around the world, and David&#x27;s collection aims to give a representative overview of the development of ceramics that is unique to China. He chose the pieces based on the quality of the workmanship and historical importance with a view towards education. 

Many pieces in the collection were imperial wares of the Ming and Qing dynasty, and David collected an unusual number of the rare Song dynasty Ru ware. Other notable items in the collection are the David Vases, and a chicken cup for serving wine during the reign of the Ming emperor Chenghua. Just before the opening of the collection in 1952, the foundation was also given a small collection of mostly monochrome porcelain belonging to Mountstuart Elphinstone.

At the British Museum, the collection of the 1,700 items starts with the David Vases placed before the main space of Room 95. Around two hundred of the best pieces are displayed in cases in the centre of the room, with the remaining 1,500 pieces arranged more compactly in rows of glass shelves around the room.

<doc id="632889" wikidata="Q585856" url="?curid=632889" title="Emmanuel, comte de Las Cases">
<text>Emmanuel-Augustin-Dieudonné-Joseph, comte de Las Cases (21 June 176615 May 1842) was a French atlas-maker and author, famed for an admiring book about Napoleon, &quot;Le Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène&quot; (&quot;The Memorial of Saint Helena&quot;).

==Life and career==
He was born at the castle of Las Cases near Revel in Languedoc. He was educated at the military schools of Vendôme and Paris. He entered the navy and took part in various engagements during the years 1781–1782. The outbreak of the Revolution in 1789 caused him to go into exile. He spent some years in Germany and England, participating in the disastrous Quiberon expedition (1795). He was one of the few survivors and returned to London, where he lived in poverty, until finding his vocation as a private tutor.

In 1801, in London and under the pseudonym, A. Lesage, he published in English the original edition of his famous atlas, which immediately proved a great success. Returning to Paris after the Peace of Amiens (1802), and having received amnesty, he issued the first French edition in 1803–1804, called &quot;Atlas historique, genealogique, chronologique et geographique de A. Lesage&quot;. Multiple editions, translations, spin-offs, several pirated, followed down to the 1850s. The atlas made Las Cases rich. It came to Napoleon&#x27;s notice only when, in Las Cases&#x27;s company, he went into exile on St Helena (1815).

The Peace of Amiens (1802) made provision for an amnesty for émigrés. Renouncing his hereditary title of marquis, Las Cases availed himself of this amnesty to repatriate himself. He returned to France during the Consulate with other royalists who rallied to the side of Napoleon, and stated afterwards to the emperor that he was conquered by his glory. Not until 1810 did he receive much notice from Napoleon&#x27;s government, which then made him a chamberlain and created him a count of the empire. After the first abdication of the emperor (April 11, 1814), Las Cases retired to England, but returned to serve Napoleon during the Hundred Days.

The second abdication opened up for Las Cases the most noteworthy part of his career. He withdrew with the ex-emperor and a few other trusty followers to Rochefort. It was Las Cases who first proposed and strongly urged the emperor to throw himself on the generosity of the British nation. Las Cases made the first overtures to Captain Maitland of HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and received a guarded reply, the nature of which he afterwards misrepresented.

Las Cases and his son accompanied the ex-emperor to Saint Helena. He then acted informally but very assiduously as his secretary, taking down numerous notes of his conversations, which thereafter took form in the famous &quot;Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène&quot;. The &quot;Mémorial&quot; should today be read with great caution, as the compiler did not hesitate to insert his own thoughts and to colour the expressions of his master. In some cases, he misstated facts and even fabricated documents. Pages corrected in the hand of Napoleon are in the Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum in Wisbech, England.

It is far less trustworthy than the record penned by Gaspard Gourgaud in his Journal. Disliked by Montholon and Gourgaud, Las Cases seems to have sought an opportunity to leave the island when he had accumulated sufficient literary material. However that may be, he infringed the British regulations in such a way as to lead to his expulsion by the governor, Sir Hudson Lowe (November 1816). He was sent first to the Cape of Good Hope and thence to Europe, but was not at first allowed by the government of Louis XVIII to enter France. He resided in Brussels. Having gained permission to come to Paris after the death of Napoleon, he took up residence there, published the &quot;Mémorial&quot;, and soon made a fortune from it. In 1840, when the expedition set sail for St Helena to bring back Napoleon&#x27;s remains, he was too ill to go, but his son who had shared his captivity was able to go. Las Cases died in 1842 at age 75, in Passy, and is buried in Passy Cemetery.

<doc id="632894" wikidata="Q157197" url="?curid=632894" title="Aden Adde">
<text>Aden Abdulle Osman Da’ar (, ) (9 December 1908 – 8 June 2007), popularly known as Aden Adde, was a Somali politician who served as the first president of the Somali Republic from 1 July 1960 to 6 July 1967. He had previously served in the Somali Youth League in 1944. 

In 1946, he was named Secretary of the party&#x27;s section in Beledweyne, Somalia. In 1951, the Mudug Regional Council appointed him for the Regional Council, and two years later, he became Vice President of the Regional Council. From 1954 until 1956, he was the President of the Somali Youth League. He was re-elected in May 1958, and he continued to hold this position simultaneously along with that of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly until 1960. 

Osman Daar was born in Beledweyne, Somalia. He studied at government schools, and worked as a community organizer. Somalia was colonized by the Italian government from 1889 to 1941. From 1929 to 1941, he served in the Italian Colonial Administration advocating for Somalia&#x27;s independence from colonization. He was a proponent for the unity of all Somalis.

In 1960, Osman Daar garnered national attention, and won the favor of the Somali people. He was formally and democratically elected as the first president of Somalia on 1 July 1960, on which date the United Nations recognised Somalia&#x27;s independence, and subsequently united with the former British protectorate of British Somaliland, which had already obtained its independence on 26 June 1960. His administration was focused on dismantling the legacy of colonialism and fostering unity among the Somali people.

==Early life and career==
Daar was born on 9 December 1908 in Beledweyne, situated in the south-central Hiraan region of Somalia. He hailed from the Udejeen, Abdile Afarah clan of Hawiye. He was an orphan, who lost his parents at a young age. Daar, was an avid reader, and self taught on many subjects. He spoke Arabic, Somali, Italian and English.

==Political career==
===Somali Youth League===
Daar joined the incipient Somali Youth League (SYL) political party in 1944, a nationalist organization that campaigned for an independent Somalia. Quickly rising through the ranks, he became the local secretary of the SYL&#x27;s Beledweyne branch in 1946. A decade later, he became Chairman of the National Legislative Assembly, and would eventually lead the SYL itself two years afterwards.

===Presidency===
By the time Somalia gained its independence in 1960, Daar had attained widespread prominence as a nationalist figure. In short order, he was elected the country&#x27;s first President, a position he would assume from 1960 to 1967. During his tenure, he proactively pursued an irredentist national policy for the restoration of lost Somali territories. Notable incidents include the 1964 Ethiopian–Somali Border War, the Shifta War of Kenya, the Front de Libération de la Côte des Somalis battle for Djiboutian Independence as well as support for the ELF in Eritrea and the Bale Revolt of the Oromo in Ethiopia. His rivals in Kenya and Ethiopia had subsequently signed a defence pact in 1965 in order to curb what they deemed as expansion on their doorstep. In line with these policies, President Aden also enrolled Somalia into a number of organisations to advocate for the freedom and liberties of all colonised nations such as the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organisation of African Unity and the World Muslim Congress in which Somalia hosted the Congress&#x27; 6th conference in 1966. Notable countries which Somalia in his time advocated for and supported with men or material include South Africa and Palestine during the Six Day War.

Known as the Switzerland of Africa for its free market and democracy, Somalia under President Aden pursued modest economic planning to improve domestic revenue. His publicised First Five Year Plan (1963-1967) demonstrated its simple development strategy concentrated on a handful of projects: an increased output of sugar through expanding the productive capacity of the existing factory at Jowhar; the development of meat packing, fish processing, milk and dairy products, textiles, and a few other industries; the construction or improvement of a number of roads; building three seaports at Kismayo, Berbera, and Mogadiscio; the expansion of irrigation for crops and fodder; the formation of a number of state farms; certain improvements in social services, including education and health. Sectoral allocations of planned investment outlays reflected a greater priority for physical infrastructure than agricultural development or population settlement. Though the Plan was essentially a public expenditure programme, it also gave considerable encouragement to private enterprise, offering incentives in the form of protection, exemption from certain taxes for a limited period and the grant of loans on favourable terms to those firms prepared to invest in industries which have a reasonable scope for becoming profitable and the establishment of which is desirable in the national interest.
In the 1967 presidential election, Aden was defeated by Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, his former Prime Minister. His term as president ended on July 6, 1967. Aden accepted the loss graciously, making history as the first head of state in Africa (excluding Liberia) to peacefully hand over power to a democratically elected successor.

Shermarke was assassinated two years later by one of his own bodyguards. The slaying led to an unopposed, bloodless coup d&#x27;état by the Somali Army on 21 October 1969, the day after Shermarke&#x27;s funeral. Spearheading the putsch was Major General Muhammad Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.

===Manifesto===
In 1990, with the start of the civil war, Daar along with former Minister of Information Ismail Jim&#x27;ale Osoble, former Minister of Education Hassan Ali Mire, and about 100 other Somali politicians signed a manifesto expressing concern over the violence and advocating reconciliation. Daar was summarily arrested, and remained imprisoned until the ultimate collapse of Barre&#x27;s regime the following year.

==Later years==
After his release, Daar spent the better part of his later years on his farm in Janale, in southern Somalia.

On 22 May 2007, it was erroneously reported that he had died in a hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. He was, however, in critical condition and on life support. Daar died in hospital on 8 June 2007, at the age of 98.

The Transitional Federal Government, then headed by former President of Somalia Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, declared 21 days of mourning, complete with a national memorial service, and issued a statement that Daar would receive a state funeral. It also renamed Mogadishu International Airport to Aden Adde International Airport in his honor.

<doc id="632899" wikidata="Q6692765" url="?curid=632899" title="Low-level waste">
<text>Low-level waste (LLW) or low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) is a category of nuclear waste. The definition of low-level waste is set by the nuclear regulators of individual countries, though the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provides recommendations. 

LLW includes items that have become contaminated with radioactive material or have become radioactive through exposure to neutron radiation. This waste typically consists of contaminated protective shoe covers and clothing, wiping rags, mops, filters, reactor water treatment residues, equipments and tools, luminous dials, medical tubes, swabs, injection needles, syringes, and laboratory animal carcasses and tissues.

== LLW in the United Kingdom ==
In the UK, LLW is defined as waste with specific activities below 12 gigabecquerel/ tonne (GBq/t) beta/gamma and below 4 GBq/t alpha emitting nuclides. Waste with specific activities above these thresholds are categorised as either Intermediate-level waste (ILW) or high heat generating waste depending upon the heat output of the waste.

Very Low Level Waste (VLLW) is a sub-category of LLW. VLLW is LLW that is suitable disposal with regular household or industrial waste at specially permitted landfill facilities. The major components of VLLW from nuclear sites are building rubble, soil and steel items. These arise from the dismantling and demolition of nuclear reactors and facilities.

== LLW in the United States ==
LLW in the United States is defined as nuclear waste that does not fit into the categorical definitions: high-level waste (HLW), spent nuclear fuel (SNF), transuranic waste (TRU), or certain byproduct materials known as 11e(2) wastes, such as uranium mill tailings. In essence, it is a definition by exclusion, and LLW is that category of radioactive wastes that do not fit into the other categories. If LLW is mixed with hazardous wastes as classified by RCRA, then it has a special status as mixed low-level waste (MLLW) and must satisfy treatment, storage, and disposal regulations both as LLW and as hazardous waste. While the bulk of LLW is not highly radioactive, the definition of LLW does not include references to its activity, and some LLW may be quite radioactive, as in the case of radioactive sources used in industry and medicine.

It is notable that U.S. regulations do not define the category intermediate-level waste and thus many wastes which would fall into this category under other regulatory regimes are instead classified as LLW. This also means that the radioactive of LLW in the US can range from just above background levels found in nature to very highly radioactive in certain cases such as parts from inside the reactor vessel in a nuclear power plant.

=== Disposal ===
Depending on who &quot;owns&quot; the waste, its handling and disposal is regulated differently. All nuclear facilities, whether they are a utility or a disposal site, have to comply with Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations. The four low-level waste facilities in the U.S. are Barnwell, South Carolina; Richland, Washington; Clive, Utah; and as of June 2013, Andrews County, Texas. The Barnwell and the Clive locations are operated by EnergySolutions, the Richland location is operated by U.S. Ecology, and the Andrews County location is operated by Waste Control Specialists. Barnwell, Richland, and Andrews County accept Classes A through C of low-level waste, whereas Clive only accepts Class A LLW. The DOE has dozens of LLW sites under management. The largest of these exist at DOE Reservations around the country (e.g. the Hanford Reservation, Savannah River Site, Nevada Test Site, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory, to name the most significant).

Classes of wastes are detailed in 10 C.F.R. § 61.55 Waste Classification, enforced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, reproduced in the table below. These are not all the isotopes disposed of at these facilities, just the ones that are of most concern for the long-term monitoring of the sites. Waste is divided into three classes, A through C, where A is the least radioactive and C is the most radioactive. Class A LLW is able to be deposited near the surface, whereas Classes B and C LLW have to be buried progressively deeper.

In 10 C.F.R. § 20.2002, the NRC reserves the right to grant a free release of radioactive waste. The overall activity of such a disposal cannot exceed 1 mrem/yr and the NRC regards requests on a case-by-case basis. Low-level waste passing such strict regulations is then disposed of in a landfill with other garbage. Items allowed to be disposed of in this way include glow-in-the-dark watches (radium) and smoke detectors (americium).

LLW should not be confused with high-level waste (HLW) or spent nuclear fuel (SNF). C Class low level waste has a limit of 100 nano-Curies per gram of alpha-emitting transuranic nuclides with a half life greater than 5 years; any more than 100 nCi, and it must be classified as transuranic waste (TRU). These require different disposal pathways. TRU wastes from the U.S. nuclear weapons complex is currently disposed at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico, though other sites also are being considered for on-site disposal of particularly difficult to manage TRU wastes.
