<text>Whirlpool is an independent Australian website founded in 1998. Since then, it has grown significantly and has over 907,000 registered accounts. Primarily a discussion forum, some extra functionality such as Broadband Choice was included, although this functionality has been removed from the site.

==History==
Whirlpool began as a community resource for users of Telstra&#x27;s BigPond cable Internet service, the name &quot;Whirlpool&quot; being a parody of &quot;BigPond&quot;. However, it soon expanded to cover Optus&#x27; Optus@Home (now known as OptusNet) cable internet service, ADSL-based services, and other forms of broadband ISPs in Australia, as they became available.

===2Clix controversy===
On 11 September 2007, it was announced that 2Clix Software was commencing legal action against Whirlpool founder Simon Wright for posts made by users in the Whirlpool forums that 2Clix claimed were &quot;false and malicious&quot;. 2Clix claimed it had lost approximately A$150,000 income per month between January and July 2007 and sued for that amount plus legal costs. Whirlpool users responded immediately by sending PayPal donations to assist with the site&#x27;s legal costs, with some users claiming they had sent donations exceeding A$1,000. The co-founder of PIPE Networks personally pledged a donation of A$10,000 towards the cause.

On 19 September 2007, solicitors for 2Clix stated that they had received instructions to discontinue the case. 2Clix entered voluntary liquidation in late 2007 and its director was subsequently declared bankrupt.

==Broadband Choice==
Broadband Choice allowed a user to find options available to them and to filter them by features such as price, speed and usage limits. In most cases, details about internet service providers (ISPs) and their plans were maintained by staff of each ISP, which were then editorially approved by Whirlpool.

Broadband Choice was retired on 29 June 2015 with the link redirecting to a page outlining the reasons for closure.

==Whirlpool forums==
The primary purpose of the forums is to provide a venue in which to discuss broadband and related areas (such as networking). Representatives from many Australian service providers, hardware vendors and merchants use Whirlpool as a strictly non-official support and communication channel.

Whirlpool uses custom forum software. Some features present on other message boards such as signatures, avatars and in-line images are not provided. When threads and posts are deleted or moved, placeholders are left allowing users to see the alleged moderation that has occurred. This is different from other common forum software where deleted material may simply disappear from view.

The forum also has areas for discussing more general topics, known as &quot;lounges&quot;. Some of them are only available to long-standing or highly active members of the community.

==Knowledge base==
Whirlpool has its own Wiki. It is an accumulation of information put together by forum users in &quot;sticky threads&quot; over time, with the hope of cutting down forum clutter, while also allowing more collaborative content development. It includes information that is difficult to find aggregated in one place elsewhere, such as the Australian Exchange Guide (a guide to the locations of Australian telephone exchanges), a list of Australian computer shops and a list of Australian VoIP providers.

==History==
Simon Wright, as founder and main developer, developed the site in CFML. Phil Sweeney assists by writing news and by keeping &quot;Broadband Choice&quot; updated, when it was online.

Previously, Whirlpool existed with no revenue stream. Unlike many forums, Whirlpool had no banners or paid advertising. However, in 2008, the owner began using Google AdSense in pages that result from Google searches, for users who are not logged in.

Most day-to-day administrative tasks are conducted by a team of unpaid volunteer members, who have been given varying degrees of moderation privileges in the forums.

==Awards==
In its first few years, Whirlpool was nominated for several awards:
*&quot;Best Technology Media Website&quot;, IT Journalism Awards
**Nominated, 2003
**Winner, 2004 
**Winner, 2005 
**Finalist, 2006
*&quot;Best Technology Title&quot;, IT Journalism Awards
**Winner, 2004

<text>A mycotoxin (from the Greek μύκης , &quot;fungus&quot; and τοξικός , &quot;poisonous&quot;) is a toxic secondary metabolite produced by fungi and is capable of causing disease and death in both humans and other animals. The term &#x27;mycotoxin&#x27; is usually reserved for the toxic chemical products produced by fungi that readily colonize crops.

Examples of mycotoxins causing human and animal illness include aflatoxin, citrinin, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, patulin, trichothecenes, zearalenone, and ergot alkaloids such as ergotamine.

One mold species may produce many different mycotoxins, and several species may produce the same mycotoxin.

==Production==
Most fungi are aerobic (use oxygen) and are found almost everywhere in extremely small quantities due to the diminutive size of their spores. They consume organic matter wherever humidity and temperature are sufficient. Where conditions are right, fungi proliferate into colonies and mycotoxin levels become high. The reason for the production of mycotoxins is not yet known; they are not necessary for the growth or the development of the fungi. Because mycotoxins weaken the receiving host, they may improve the environment for further fungal proliferation. The production of toxins depends on the surrounding intrinsic and extrinsic environments and these substances vary greatly in their toxicity, depending on the organism infected and its susceptibility, metabolism, and defense mechanisms.

==Major groups==
Aflatoxins are a type of mycotoxin produced by &quot;Aspergillus&quot; species of fungi, such as &quot;A. flavus&quot; and &quot;A. parasiticus&quot;. The umbrella term aflatoxin refers to four different types of mycotoxins produced, which are B1, B2, G1, and G2. Aflatoxin B1, the most toxic, is a potent carcinogen and has been directly correlated to adverse health effects, such as liver cancer, in many animal species. Aflatoxins are largely associated with commodities produced in the tropics and subtropics, such as cotton, peanuts, spices, pistachios, and maize. According to the USDA, &quot;They are probably the best known and most intensively researched mycotoxins in the world.&quot;

Ochratoxin is a mycotoxin that comes in three secondary metabolite forms, A, B, and C. All are produced by &quot;Penicillium&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus&quot; species. The three forms differ in that Ochratoxin B (OTB) is a nonchlorinated form of Ochratoxin A (OTA) and that Ochratoxin C (OTC) is an ethyl ester form Ochratoxin A. &quot;Aspergillus ochraceus&quot; is found as a contaminant of a wide range of commodities including beverages such as beer and wine. &quot;Aspergillus carbonarius&quot; is the main species found on vine fruit, which releases its toxin during the juice making process. OTA has been labeled as a carcinogen and a nephrotoxin, and has been linked to tumors in the human urinary tract, although research in humans is limited by confounding factors.

Citrinin is a toxin that was first isolated from &quot;Penicillium citrinum&quot;, but has been identified in over a dozen species of &quot;Penicillium&quot; and several species of &quot;Aspergillus&quot;. Some of these species are used to produce human foodstuffs such as cheese (&quot;Penicillium camemberti&quot;), sake, miso, and soy sauce (&quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;). Citrinin is associated with yellowed rice disease in Japan and acts as a nephrotoxin in all animal species tested. Although it is associated with many human foods (wheat, rice, corn, barley, oats, rye, and food colored with Monascus pigment) its full significance for human health is unknown. Citrinin can also act synergistically with Ochratoxin A to depress RNA synthesis in murine kidneys.

Ergot alkaloids are compounds produced as a toxic mixture of alkaloids in the sclerotia of species of &quot;Claviceps&quot;, which are common pathogens of various grass species. The ingestion of ergot sclerotia from infected cereals, commonly in the form of bread produced from contaminated flour, causes ergotism, the human disease historically known as St. Anthony&#x27;s Fire. There are two forms of ergotism: gangrenous, affecting blood supply to extremities, and convulsive, affecting the central nervous system. Modern methods of grain cleaning have significantly reduced ergotism as a human disease; however, it is still an important veterinary problem. Ergot alkaloids have been used pharmaceutically.

Patulin is a toxin produced by the &quot;P. expansum&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, &quot;Penicillium&quot;, and &quot;Paecilomyces&quot; fungal species. &quot;P. expansum&quot; is especially associated with a range of moldy fruits and vegetables, in particular rotting apples and figs. It is destroyed by the fermentation process and so is not found in apple beverages, such as cider. Although patulin has not been shown to be carcinogenic, it has been reported to damage the immune system in animals. In 2004, the European Community set limits to the concentrations of patulin in food products. They currently stand at 50 μg/kg in all fruit juice concentrations, at 25 μg/kg in solid apple products used for direct consumption, and at 10 μg/kg for children&#x27;s apple products, including apple juice.

Fusarium toxins are produced by over 50 species of &quot;Fusarium&quot; and have a history of infecting the grain of developing cereals such as wheat and maize. They include a range of mycotoxins, such as: the fumonisins, which affect the nervous systems of horses and may cause cancer in rodents; the trichothecenes, which are most strongly associated with chronic and fatal toxic effects in animals and humans; and zearalenone, which is not correlated to any fatal toxic effects in animals or humans. Some of the other major types of &quot;Fusarium&quot; toxins include: enniatins such as beauvericin), butenolide, equisetin, and fusarins.

==Occurrence==
Although various wild mushrooms contain an assortment of poisons that are definitely fungal metabolites causing noteworthy health problems for humans, they are rather arbitrarily excluded from discussions of mycotoxicology. In such cases the distinction is based on the size of the producing fungus and human intention. Mycotoxin exposure is almost always accidental whereas with mushrooms improper identification and ingestion causing mushroom poisoning is commonly the case. Ingestion of misidentified mushrooms containing mycotoxins may result in hallucinations. The cyclopeptide-producing &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot; is well known for its toxic potential and is responsible for approximately 90% of all mushroom fatalities. The other primary mycotoxin groups found in mushrooms include: orellanine, monomethylhydrazine, disulfiram-like, hallucinogenic indoles, muscarinic, isoxazole, and gastrointestinal (GI)-specific irritants. The bulk of this article is about mycotoxins that are found in microfungi other than poisons from mushrooms or macroscopic fungi.

===In indoor environments===
Buildings are another source of mycotoxins and people living or working in areas with mold increase their chances of adverse health effects. Molds growing in buildings can be divided into three groups – primary, secondary, and tertiary colonizers. Each group is categorized by the ability to grow at a certain water activity requirement. It has become difficult to identify mycotoxin production by indoor molds for many variables, such as (i) they may be masked as derivatives, (ii) they are poorly documented, and (iii) the fact that they are likely to produce different metabolites on building materials. Some of the mycotoxins in the indoor environment are produced by &quot;Alternaria&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus&quot; (multiple forms), &quot;Penicillium&quot;, and &quot;Stachybotrys&quot;. &quot;Stachybotrys chartarum&quot; contains a higher number of mycotoxins than other molds grown in the indoor environment and has been associated with allergies and respiratory inflammation. The infestation of &quot;S. chartarum&quot; in buildings containing gypsum board, as well as on ceiling tiles, is very common and has recently become a more recognized problem. When gypsum board has been repeatedly introduced to moisture, &quot;S. chartarum&quot; grows readily on its cellulose face. This stresses the importance of moisture controls and ventilation within residential homes and other buildings. The negative health effects of mycotoxins are a function of the concentration, the duration of exposure, and the subject&#x27;s sensitivities. The concentrations experienced in a normal home, office, or school are often too low to trigger a health response in occupants.

In the 1990s, public concern over mycotoxins increased following multimillion-dollar toxic mold settlements. The lawsuits took place after a study by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Cleveland, Ohio, reported an association between mycotoxins from &quot;Stachybotrys&quot; spores and pulmonary hemorrhage in infants. However, in 2000, based on internal and external reviews of their data, the CDC concluded that because of flaws in their methods, the association was not proven. &quot;Stachybotrys&quot; spores in animal studies have been shown to cause lung hemorrhaging, but only at very high concentrations.

One study by the Center of Integrative Toxicology at Michigan State University investigated the causes of Damp Building Related Illness (DBRI). They found that &quot;Stachybotrys&quot; is possibly an important contributing factor to DBRI. So far animal models indicate that airway exposure to &quot;S. chartarum &quot; can evoke allergic sensitization, inflammation, and cytotoxicity in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Trichothecene toxicity appears to be an underlying cause of many of these adverse effects. Recent findings indicate that lower doses (studies usually involve high doses) can cause these symptoms.

Some toxicologists have used the Concentration of No Toxicological Concern (CoNTC) measure to represent the airborne concentration of mycotoxins that are expected to cause no hazard to humans (exposed continuously throughout a 70–yr lifetime). The resulting data of several studies have thus far demonstrated that common exposures to airborne mycotoxins in the built indoor environment are below the CoNTC, however agricultural environments have potential to produce levels greater than the CoNTC.

===In food===
Mycotoxins can appear in the food chain as a result of fungal infection of crops, either by being eaten directly by humans or by being used as livestock feed.

In 2004 in Kenya, 125 people died and nearly 200 others required medical treatment after eating aflatoxin-contaminated maize.
The deaths were mainly associated with homegrown maize that had not been treated with fungicides or properly dried before storage. Due to food shortages at the time, farmers may have been harvesting maize earlier than normal to prevent thefts from their fields, so that the grain had not fully matured and was more susceptible to infection.

Spices are susceptible substrate for growth of mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxin production. Red chilli, black pepper, and dry ginger were found to be the most contaminated spices.

Physical methods to prevent growth of mycotoxin‐producing fungi or remove toxins from contaminated food include temperature and humidity control, irradiation and photodynamic treatment. Mycotoxins can also be removed chemically and biologically using antifungal/anti‐mycotoxins agents and antifungal plant metabolites.

===In animal food===

Dimorphic fungi, which include Blastomyces dermatitidis and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, are known causative agents of endemic systemic mycoses.

There were outbreaks of dog food containing aflatoxin in North America in late 2005 and early 2006, and again in late 2011.

Mycotoxins in animal fodder, particularly silage, can decrease the performance of farm animals and potentially kill them. Several mycotoxins reduce milk yield when ingested by dairy cattle.

===In dietary supplements===
Contamination of medicinal plants with mycotoxins can contribute to adverse human health problems and therefore represents a special hazard. Numerous natural occurrences of mycotoxins in medicinal plants and herbal medicines have been reported from various countries including Spain, China, Germany, India, Turkey and from the Middle East. In a 2015 analysis of plant-based dietary supplements, the highest mycotoxin concentrations were found in milk thistle-based supplements, at up to 37 mg/kg.

==Health effects==
Some of the health effects found in animals and humans include death, identifiable diseases or health problems, weakened immune systems without specificity to a toxin, and as allergens or irritants. Some mycotoxins are harmful to other micro-organisms such as other fungi or even bacteria; penicillin is one example. It has been suggested that mycotoxins in stored animal feed are the cause of rare phenotypical sex changes in hens that causes them to look and act male. Mycotoxins impact on health may be &quot;very hard&quot; and can be categorized in three forms &quot;as mutagenic, carcinogenic, and genotoxic.&quot;

===In humans===
Mycotoxicosis is the term used for poisoning associated with exposures to mycotoxins. Mycotoxins have the potential for both acute and chronic health effects via ingestion, skin contact, inhalation, and entering the blood stream and lymphatic system. They inhibit protein synthesis, damage macrophage systems, inhibit particle clearance of the lung, and increase sensitivity to bacterial endotoxin. Testing for mycotoxicosis can be conducted using immunoaffinity columns.

The symptoms of mycotoxicosis depend on the type of mycotoxin; the concentration and length of exposure; as well as age, health, and sex of the exposed individual. The synergistic effects associated with several other factors such as genetics, diet, and interactions with other toxins have been poorly studied. Therefore, it is possible that vitamin deficiency, caloric deprivation, excessive alcohol use, and infectious disease status can all have compounded effects with mycotoxins.

==Mitigation==
Mycotoxins greatly resist decomposition or being broken down in digestion, so they remain in the food chain in meat and dairy products. Even temperature treatments, such as cooking and freezing, do not destroy some mycotoxins.

===Removal===
In the feed and food industry, it has become common practice to add mycotoxin binding agents such as montmorillonite or bentonite clay in order to effectively adsorb the mycotoxins. To reverse the adverse effects of mycotoxins, the following criteria are used to evaluate the functionality of any binding additive:
* Efficacy of active component verified by scientific data
* A low effective inclusion rate
* Stability over a wide pH range
* High capacity to absorb high concentrations of mycotoxins
* High affinity to absorb low concentrations of mycotoxins
* Affirmation of chemical interaction between mycotoxin and adsorbent
* Proven &quot;in vivo&quot; data with all major mycotoxins
* Non-toxic, environmentally friendly component

Since not all mycotoxins can be bound to such agents, the latest approach to mycotoxin control is mycotoxin deactivation. By means of enzymes (esterase, de-epoxidase), yeast (&quot;Trichosporon mycotoxinvorans&quot;), or bacterial strains (Eubacterium BBSH 797 developed by Biomin), mycotoxins can be reduced during pre-harvesting contamination. Other removal methods include physical separation, washing, milling, nixtamalization, heat-treatment, radiation, extraction with solvents, and the use of chemical or biological agents. Irradiation methods have proven to be effective treatment against mold growth and toxin production.

===Regulations===
Many international agencies are trying to achieve universal standardization of regulatory limits for mycotoxins. Currently, over 100 countries have regulations regarding mycotoxins in the feed industry, in which 13 mycotoxins or groups of mycotoxins are of concern. The process of assessing a regulated mycotoxin involves a wide array of in-laboratory testing that includes extracting, clean-up columns, and separation techniques. Most official regulations and control methods are based on high-performance liquid techniques (e.g., HPLC) through international bodies. It is implied that any regulations regarding these toxins will be in co-ordinance with any other countries with which a trade agreement exists. Many of the standards for the method performance analysis for mycotoxins is set by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). However, one must take note that scientific risk assessment is commonly influenced by culture and politics, which, in turn, will affect trade regulations of mycotoxins.

Food-based mycotoxins were studied extensively worldwide throughout the 20th century. In Europe, statutory levels of a range of mycotoxins permitted in food and animal feed are set by a range of European directives and EC regulations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulated and enforced limits on concentrations of mycotoxins in foods and feed industries since 1985. It is through various compliance programs that the FDA monitors these industries to guarantee that mycotoxins are kept at a practical level. These compliance programs sample food products including peanuts and peanut products, tree nuts, corn and corn products, cottonseed, and milk. There is still a lack of sufficient surveillance data on some mycotoxins that occur in the U.S.

<text>HMS &quot;Ariadne&quot; was a &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Navy. She was launched in 1971, was sold to Chile in 1992 and sunk as a target hulk in 2004.

==Construction==
&quot;Ariadne&quot; was one of two &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates ordered from Yarrow Shipbuilders as part of the 1967–68 construction programme for the Royal Navy, the last two ships of the class with the order announced on 29 July 1968. &quot;Ariadne&quot; was laid down at Yarrow&#x27;s Scotstoun shipyard on 1 November 1969, and was launched on 10 September 1971 and completed on 10 February 1973, commissioning on 2 March 1973 at Devonport. She was the last of the &quot;Leander&quot; class to be completed. Like the rest of the &quot;Leander&quot; class, she was named after a figure of Greek mythology; Ariadne was the daughter of King Minos of Crete. She was the eighth ship of that name to serve with the Royal Navy. 

&quot;Ariadne&quot; was a Batch 3, &quot;Broad-Beamed&quot; &quot;Leander&quot;, and as such was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of . She had a range of at or at top speed.

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. A single Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launcher was fitted aft (on the Helicopter hangar roof), while two Oerlikon 20mm cannon provided close-in defence. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations. &quot;Ariadne&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 978 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 184 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar, together with a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS). She had a crew of 260 officers and other ranks.

==Royal Navy==
In the year of her commission, &quot;Ariadne&quot; undertook a fishery protection patrol during the Second Cod War with Iceland.

From January to October 1974, &quot;Ariadne&quot; in company with the guided missile destroyer (FOF2 embarked), , , , and supported by oilers and and the stores ship , made a nine-month deployment to the Far East, visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, South Africa and Gibraltar. &quot;Ariadne&quot; participated in the Beira Patrol. She also refuelled from an old oiler permanently moored at Gan in the Indian Ocean. Between 1975 and 1976 she was commanded by Captain Benjamin Bathurst.

In 1976, &quot;Ariadne&quot; completed a refit at Devonport, and the following year took part in the annual group deployment, visiting a variety of ports in South America and West Africa, as well as performing naval exercises.

In 1977, &quot;Galatea&quot; also took part in the Fleet Review, in honour of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. &quot;Ariadne&quot; was part of the 7th Frigate Squadron. Following the Silver Jubilee Review, &quot;Ariadne&quot; was appointed guardship at Belize. From May to August 1979, &quot;Ariadne&quot; served as part of Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), a NATO multi-national squadron.

&quot;Ariadne&quot; was intended for modernisation, which would have included the removal of her one 4.5-in Mk.6 gun, which would have been replaced by the Exocet anti-ship missile, as well as the addition of the Sea Wolf missile, but the 1981 Defence Review by the defence minister John Nott, cancelled the modernisation for &quot;Ariadne&quot; and other Batch III &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates. In 1981 &quot;Ariadne&quot; became the West Indies Guard Ship and, while there, performed a variety of duties in that region.

In 1983 she shadowed the Soviet cruiser &quot;Slava&quot;. It was a common practice during the Cold War, with Soviet warships quite often shadowing Royal Navy vessels in return. In 1987 &quot;Ariadne&quot; joined the 6th Frigate Squadron.

&quot;Ariadne&quot; came out of refit in Rosyth Dockyard, Fife, Scotland in 1989 and replaced in the Dartmouth Training Squadron. 

In 1990, in consort with HM ships and , she took part in &quot;Endeavour &#x27;90&quot;, a six-month circumnavigation of the globe. During this deployment she travelled 32,000 miles. Between 1988 and 1990 she was commanded by Commander Adrian Johns.

&quot;Ariadne&quot; was formally adopted by Scunthorpe Borough Council on 8 March 1973. The ship&#x27;s anchor is still located outside the now North Lincolnshire Council&#x27;s main administrative Civic Centre, and the ship&#x27;s bell is situated outside the council chamber inside the Civic Centre.

==Chilean Navy==
&quot;Ariadne&quot; was finally decommissioned by the Royal Navy in May 1992 and was subsequently sold to Chile, being renamed &quot;General Baquedano&quot;. She was decommissioned from the Chilean Navy in December 1998 and sunk as target in 2004.

<doc id="612960" wikidata="Q5359607" url="?curid=612960" title="Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue">
<text>Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue (13 February 1783 – 14 September 1861), styled Viscount Ebrington from 1789 to 1841, was a British Whig politician. He was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1839 to 1841.

==Early life==
Fortescue was the eldest son of Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Fortescue and Hester Grenville, daughter of Prime Minister George Grenville. He was educated at Eton and Brasenose College, Oxford.

==Career==
Fortescue (as Ebrington) first became an MP for Barnstaple, just after his 21st birthday; and he sat for various constituencies almost continuously until 1839, when he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Fortescue.

Ebrington had entered Parliament in the 1800s as a Grenvillite connection, belonging to that section of the Whig party that supported the war with Napoleon; but in the following decade (in a generational shift) he broke away from them to join the Young Whigs. Fearing the corruptive effects of militarism on British society, the latter sympathised with the liberalising side of the French Revolution: Ebrington would later publish his conversations with Napoleon in his Elba exile.

After the war, in 1817, Ebrington confirmed his breach with the bulk of his Grenville relatives, and emerged as a prominent pro-Reform Whig—albeit one somewhat unusually rooted in a liberal, morally intense Anglicanism,—which he combined with an interest in political economy. Ebrington strongly condemned the Six Acts as ”the most alarming attack ever made by Parliament upon the liberties and constitution of the country”; and during the 1820s, he would repeatedly promote and vote for Parliamentary Reform.

When the Whigs finally came to power in 1830, Ebrington played a significant part in the passing of the Great Reform Act. After the Commons passed the second bill, Ebrington convened a meeting of 100 reformist Whigs, urging strong measures should the Lords reject it, and acting as leader of a pressure group lobbying the Whig leadership: Ebrington himself appeared on a list of potential peer-creations that was drawn up to increase the pressure on the Lords. When the Government resigned in the face of Tory intransigence in the House of Lords, Ebrington took the lead, despite leadership hesitations, in moving that the House of Commons implore the King “to call to his councils such persons only as will carry into effect unimpaired in all its essential provisions that Bill for reforming the Representation of the people which has recently passed this House”.

During the 1830s, Ebrington led a strong body of Reformist Whigs; and he played a prominent role in establishing Whig party organisation under the new electoral system. In 1839, as Baron Fortescue, he served under Lord Melbourne as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, until in 1841 he succeeded his father in the earldom. He went on to serve under Lord John Russell as Lord Steward from 1846 to 1850; was sworn of the Privy Council in 1839; and created a Knight of the Garter in 1856.

Fortescue was also Colonel of the 1st Devon Militia, headquartered in Exeter Castle.

==West Buckland School==
In 1858, together with the Rev. Joseph Lloyd Brereton, a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral and Rector of West Buckland, Fortescue founded the Devon County School (now called West Buckland School), on land he donated between West and East Buckland, previously part of his North Devon estate centred at Filleigh. The school was intended to provide a top quality education to local boys, including therefore the sons of many of his tenant farmers; it continues today as an independent private school. A marble bust of Fortescue, wearing the Garter Star, sculpted in 1861 by Edward Bowring Stephens, stands on the staircase of the school&#x27;s Memorial Hall.

==Personal life==
Fortescue married firstly in 1817 Susan Ryder (died 1827), a daughter of Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby. They had three sons:
*Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Earl Fortescue (1818–1905)
*Hon. John Fortescue, MP
*Hon. Dudley Fortescue, MP

In 1841, fourteen years after the death of his first wife, Fortescue married secondly Elizabeth Geale (died May 1896), a daughter of Piers Geale and the widow of Sir Marcus Somerville, 4th Baronet (c. 1775–1831).

Fortescue died in September 1861, aged 78, and was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage, Hugh Fortescue.

==Portraits==

A statue of Fortescue stands in Exeter Castle Yard, and his marble bust is displayed on the staircase of the Memorial Hall in West Buckland School. 49 of the Fortescue family portraits were saved from the disastrous fire at Castle Hill of 9 March 1934 with minor smoke damage, but were shortly afterwards all destroyed by fire when the delivery lorry returning them from the restorer caught fire whilst parked overnight pending their return to Castle Hill.

==Arms==
Fortescue&#x27;s coat of arms is blazoned &quot;azure, a bend engrailled argent plain cottised or&quot;, and the Motto is &quot;Forte Scutum Salus Ducum&quot; (&quot;A Strong Shield is the Salvation of Leaders&quot;).

<doc id="612968" wikidata="Q885083" url="?curid=612968" title="Blood (video game)">
<text>Blood is a 3D first-person shooter video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by GT Interactive and developed using Ken Silverman’s &quot;Build engine&quot;. The shareware version was released for MS-DOS on March 7, 1997, while the full version was later released on May 21 in North America, and June 20 in Europe.

The game follows the story of Caleb, an undead early 20th century gunslinger seeking revenge against the demon Tchernobog. It features a number of occult and horror themes. &quot;Blood&quot; includes large amounts of graphic violence, a large arsenal of weapons ranging from the standard to the bizarre, and numerous enemies and bosses.

&quot;Blood&quot; received largely positive reviews from critics upon its release, with many praising its creative level designs, the humor (particularly its use of pop-culture references), atmosphere and its gameplay, though some criticism was aimed at the game&#x27;s challenging difficulty. It later gained a cult following and it is considered to be one of the best games on the &quot;Build engine&quot;.

The &quot;Blood&quot; franchise was continued with two official expansion packs titled &quot;Plasma Pak&quot; (developed by Monolith) and &quot;Cryptic Passage&quot; (developed by Sunstorm Interactive). A sequel titled &quot;Blood II: The Chosen&quot; was released on November 25, 1998. The game was released on GOG.com along with its two expansion packs on April 22, 2010, utilizing the DOSBox emulator to run on modern systems. It was released on Steam on July 14, 2014. The game also served as the principal inspiration for the manhwa &quot;Priest&quot;. A remaster of the game made to run better on modern systems entitled &quot;Blood: Fresh Supply&quot; was released on May 9, 2019, by Nightdive Studios and Atari.

==Gameplay==
In single player mode, the player takes the role of Caleb in his quest for revenge against his former master by navigating levels in episodes, looking for an exit, until the boss level.

&quot;Blood&quot;″s gameplay is similar to other classic FPS games like &quot;Doom&quot;: the player must activate switches or seek keys to go through the levels; some larger maps contain up to six different keys. Features include teleporters, traps such as crushing blocks, explosive barrels, lava pits, jumping puzzles, and combination lock doors.

&quot;Blood&quot; is one of the earliest FPS games to feature alternate or secondary attack modes for its weapons. Weapons include a flare gun, Voodoo doll, and an aerosol canister that can be used as a flamethrower. It also features a power-up known as &quot;Guns Akimbo&quot;, which allows the player to dual wield certain weapons temporarily. &quot;Blood&quot; also has &quot;super secret&quot; areas which contain rewards for discovering them.

Enemies include human members of the Cabal and creatures fighting for the demon Tchernobog. Enemies can use objects in the environment for cover. The game also features a lesser class of enemies (bats, rats, eels, possessed hands, etc.) often referred to as &quot;nuisance enemies&quot; that are not considered threats individually, but can be deadly in large numbers.

&quot;Blood&quot;, like many FPS games of the time, features multiplayer modes. When it was released, Internet play was not well established, so &quot;Blood&quot; used modem, LAN, or serial cable connections for multiplayer. Modem and serial cable connections only allow two player games, while an IPX network connection can support up to eight players. This can easily be achieved on a variety of platforms that support DOSBox and its IPX modes, coupled with VPN software such as Hamachi. Online multiplayer was also possible via the Total Entertainment Network and DWANGO.

The multiplayer modes consist of deathmatch, known in &quot;Blood&quot; as &quot;Bloodbath&quot;, and cooperative play. Bloodbath matches can be played on specifically designed multiplayer maps or on the levels of the various episodes; the &quot;frag limit&quot; or &quot;time limit&quot; options are available to end matches, as well as the possibility to control respawn mode for weapons and power-ups. A feature of Bloodbath is &quot;The Voice&quot;, an audio comment heard upon each frag, that punctuates the death of an opponent often in gory and irreverent terms. &quot;The Voice&quot; is that of Jace Hall, who was CEO of Monolith Productions at the time. Cooperative gameplay follows the lines of the single player campaign, allowing several players to work together in the levels of the different episodes.

==Plot==
&quot;Blood&quot; takes place in an unspecified time period. The various levels contain elements from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, in addition to futuristic and retro-futuristic technologies and a weird West theme. Many elements are anachronistic, including weapons and pop-culture references. The sequel, &quot;Blood II: The Chosen&quot;, retroactively dates the game to the year 1928.

The backstory is not delineated in the game itself, only on the Monolith website and a readme text document. The player takes on the role of Caleb, once the supreme commander of a cult called &quot;The Cabal&quot;, followers of the forgotten demon Tchernobog. Known as a merciless gunfighter in the late 19th century American West, Caleb joined the Cabal in 1871 after meeting Ophelia Price, a woman whose husband and son may have been murdered by the members of the Cabal; it is implied that she later became Caleb&#x27;s lover. Together they rose to the highest circle of the dark cult, &quot;The Chosen&quot;, until all four members of The Chosen were betrayed and killed by Tchernobog for unspecified failures. Several years later, Caleb rises from his grave, seeking answers and vengeance.

In search of the gargoyle Cheogh, one of Tchernobog&#x27;s minions, Caleb moves to the rail yard and station, where he boards the northbound &quot;Phantom Express&quot;. He fights off the undead which swarm the train, finally stopping the train by blowing up the locomotive. Emerging from the wreckage, cutting through swarms of Cabal loyalists and other creatures, Caleb enters the &quot;Great Temple&quot;. A teleporter in the temple leads Caleb to Cheogh&#x27;s altar, where he finds Ophelia crucified, and he fights and slays Cheogh. Caleb finishes by lighting up Ophelia&#x27;s funeral pyre to cremate her body.
Caleb heads to the Arctic north on a large icebound wooden sailing ship. He disembarks at a lumber mill the Cabal has transformed into a crude human remains processing area. He makes his way into a mine in search of the mother spider Shial&#x27;s lair. Navigating the Cabal infested tunnels, Caleb finds a dark stony cavern where he defeats Shial, crushing her with a stomp of his boot. He then rips out and consumes the heart of the webbed corpse of Gabriel, another of the betrayed Chosen, thus gaining the power of his fallen comrade.

Cerberus is promoted to Tchernobog&#x27;s second in command. Caleb moves across an industrial facility, entering a nearby dam control installation located near Cerberus&#x27; cavern, then blows up the dam with explosives. The resulting flood makes Cerberus&#x27; hideout accessible. Caleb kills Cerberus, and upon finding no trace of Ishmael, fills Cerberus&#x27; stomach with bundles of TNT, and blows up the corpse.

Caleb heads for the &quot;Hall of the Epiphany&quot; where Tchernobog is waiting. There, before facing him, Caleb learns why &quot;The Chosen&quot; were cast down: Tchernobog knew Caleb would return to him, killing anyone he ran into to take his revenge and thus gaining immense power, something Tchernobog wants for himself. Caleb battles and destroys the demon. One of Tchernobog&#x27;s followers approaches Caleb and declares him their new leader. Caleb shoots him and leaves the Hall of Epiphany.

==Expansion packs==
The first episode of &quot;Blood&quot; was released as shareware. The full retail version of &quot;Blood&quot; was released on a CD-ROM, featuring all four original episodes and all of the elements that were missing in the shareware version. The extremely violent content of the game later prompted the release of a censored version of &quot;Blood&quot; with toned-down violence. Two official expansions were released for the game. &quot;Cryptic Passage&quot; was developed by Sunstorm Interactive and features a new 10 level episode for single player and four new multiplayer levels. Monolith&#x27;s official add-on for &quot;Blood&quot; is called the &quot;Plasma Pak&quot; and contains 11 new levels, new enemies, and weapons modes. A special edition collection titled &quot;One Unit Whole Blood&quot; was released on July 15, 1998, including the fully patched versions of &quot;Blood&quot;, &quot;Cryptic Passage&quot;, and the &quot;Plasma Pak&quot;, as well as the &quot;Blood: Unlock the Secrets&quot; guide in a single package. Strategy guides for the game were also published, namely &quot;Blood: The Official Strategy Guide&quot; and &quot;Blood: Unlock the Secrets&quot;.

===&quot;Cryptic Passage&quot;===
&quot;Cryptic Passage&quot; was published by Sunstorm Interactive and is the only officially authorized commercially available add-on for &quot;Blood&quot; that was not created by Monolith. It was released on June 30, 1997, and contains 10 new single player levels and four new multiplayer Bloodbath levels.

In the episode&#x27;s new story, having heard news of an ancient scroll, Caleb sets out to retrieve it for his own dark needs.

===&quot;Plasma Pak&quot;===
Released in September 1997, the &quot;Plasma Pak&quot; expansion adds several new features to &quot;Blood&quot;; a new episode with nine single player levels titled &quot;Post Mortem&quot; is included, along with two new multiplayer Bloodbath levels, one of which was modeled after Monolith&#x27;s corporate offices, for a total of 11 levels. New enemies are included in the &quot;Plasma Pak&quot;, and all of them are featured in the extra episode; the new creatures include two new Cabal loyalist types, Chrysallid pods, miniature Calebs, and a new boss, the Beast. There are no new weapons added to Caleb&#x27;s arsenal, though some new weapon abilities are introduced; the Tesla Cannon can now be wielded akimbo (provided the appropriate power-up is collected), while the Napalm Cannon and Life Leech have new secondary attacks. The &quot;Plasma Pak&quot; also integrated a large number of bug fixes which had been previously addressed by several patches.

Episode 5: Post Mortem

After Caleb learns the Cabal is training replacements for the fallen Chosen, he sets out to stop the cult&#x27;s plans. Caleb moves into Cabal territory, wreaking havoc in a temple complex, then storming the inner temple. Satisfied the temples have been dealt with, Caleb enters the training ground for &quot;The Chosen&quot;. In order to rest, Caleb destroys each of the four &quot;Chosen&quot; in training and the Beasts within them.

==Development==

Development began at Q Studios, an independent developer funded by 3D Realms, in parallel with a number of other well-known titles. It started development in 1995. Following the success of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, development progress was made public starting in June 1996 with weekly updates on their website. It was originally scheduled for release in early 1997. Q Studios was acquired by Monolith in November 1996. On January 22, 1997, all rights had been sold to Monolith so that 3D Realms could focus efforts on &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;, another Build engine game slated for release the same year. Ports for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn were planned but never completed 

&quot;Blood&quot; was one of two games (the other being &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;) that took advantage of the Build engine&#x27;s support for voxel objects in the game world. &quot;Blood&quot; used this for weapon and ammo pickups, power-ups, and occasionally decorations, such as the tombstones in the first level of episode one, &quot;Cradle to Grave&quot;.

The Build engine was enhanced for &quot;Blood&quot; to allow new lighting effects, real-time shadows, and simulated &quot;rooms above rooms&quot;.

A central feature of &quot;Blood&quot; is an abundant (and often exaggerated) graphic violence, from which the game derives its name. Enemies can be blown to pieces, and the pieces often rain down on the player. Zombies&#x27; heads can be shot off and then kicked around like footballs, spewing fountains of blood. Enemies scream if set on fire or are otherwise injured, making sound an integral part of the violent atmosphere of &quot;Blood&quot;. The levels themselves are designed with the same spirit, as corpses, torture victims, and several grotesque situations are witnessed in the game. Collectively, these features caused some public concern about &quot;Blood&quot;, leading to a censored re-release of the game.

==Intellectual property ownership==
3D Realms sold Monolith the intellectual property (IP) so 3D Realms could make &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;. Monolith sold the publishing rights, but not the IP for &quot;Blood&quot; and its sequel to GT Interactive. GT Interactive was later acquired by Infogrames, which has since been renamed to Atari. Monolith itself was acquired by Warner Bros., which owns the &quot;Blood&quot; trademark and intellectual property. Atari re-released &quot;Blood&quot; and &quot;Blood 2&quot; on Steam and GOG, but unlike other Build engine games (&quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;), the source code for &quot;Blood&quot; has not officially been released, however multiple incomplete versions of it exist online.

== &quot;Fresh Supply&quot; ==
Night Dive Studios was commissioned by Atari to create an enhanced version of &quot;Blood.&quot; It was released on May 9, 2019, under the title &quot;Blood: Fresh Supply&quot;. The new version featured compatibility with modern operating systems and native support for monitor resolutions up to 4K, anti-aliasing, ambient occlusion and interpolation among other improvements.

== Reception ==

&quot;Blood&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews from professional critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic based on seven reviews. Critics especially praised the intricate and creative level designs, humorous wisecracks and pop culture references, over-the-top gore, variety of settings, and inventive, unconventional weaponry. &quot;GameSpot&quot; particularly noted that the Voodoo doll &quot;might be the coolest little accessory to ever grace the weapons belt of a first-person killing machine&quot;.

A few criticisms were voiced about the game, but did not find consensus among reviewers. For example, while &quot;GameSpot&quot; said the game &quot;is just too damn hard&quot;, citing how quickly enemies can deal damage, &quot;Next Generation&quot; asserted that &quot;the game is lengthy without being too tedious, and challenging without being too difficult&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; followed up its own criticisms by concluding: &quot;&quot;Blood&quot;″s flaws are easily swept aside when your guns start blasting and the bodies start falling&quot;.

GamingOnLinux reviewer Hamish Paul Wilson decided in a 2015 retrospective that &quot;Blood&quot; was easily the best of the three major Build engine games, stating that &quot;Blood&quot; was &quot;one of the most underrated shooters of the whole decade. &quot;Blood&quot; arguably built more on the legacy of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; than &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; did, taking its gameplay to sophisticated new heights and offering its referential overtones with an even greater degree of refinement&quot;. Player Attack described &quot;Blood&quot; in a 2011 article as &quot;the best of the Build engine games after &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, with its combination of scary atmosphere, great level design and challenging gameplay putting it above the rest&quot;.

More than 350,000 copies of &quot;Blood&quot; have been downloaded. This number reached one million in its first six months of release.

== Legacy ==
The manhwa series &quot;Priest&quot; created by Hyung Min-woo was inspired by &quot;Blood.&quot; An interview with Hyung in &quot;Priest, Vol. 3: Requiem for the Damned&quot; states that the comic was influenced by the game, which featured a similar horror-Western aesthetic and undead protagonist. The manhwa was adapted into the 2011 American horror film of the same name. The game has received numerous fan homages and remakes, including &quot;Transfusion&quot;, &quot;ZBlood&quot;, &quot;BloodCM&quot;, and &quot;The Flesh Game&quot;, as well as community produced source ports such as BloodGDX, NBlood and Raze. The game has also inspired several later boomer shooters such as &quot;Eternal Damnation&quot;, &quot;Viscerafest&quot;, &quot;Dread Templar&quot;, &quot;Coven&quot;, &quot;Nightmare Reaper&quot;, &quot;Project Warlock&quot;, &quot;Dusk&quot;, and most notably &quot;Cultic&quot;. It was also influential on the roguelike game &quot;Infra Arcana&quot;.

The 2014 horror film &quot;FPS - First Person Shooter&quot; features Stephan Weyte, the actor who played Caleb, as the voice of the protagonist. The Heaven nor Hell urban fantasy trilogy by Clinton A. Love, as well as subsequent books within that universe features numerous Easter eggs that reference Blood, including cultists called Chosen and the &quot;High Speech&quot; used by demons and some vampires that contains phrases reminiscent of the ones the cultists scream in Blood.

<text>&quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot; is the twentieth and final episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Written by Robert Hewitt Wolfe and directed by David Livingston, the episode originally aired in broadcast syndication during the week of June 21, 1993.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the galaxy; the wormhole is occupied by powerful alien entities that are worshiped by the people of the nearby planet Bajor as &quot;the Prophets&quot;. In this episode, friction escalates when Bajoran cleric Vedek Winn (Louise Fletcher) arrives on the station and finds schoolteacher Keiko O&#x27;Brien (Rosalind Chao) teaching Bajoran children that their gods are merely &quot;wormhole aliens&quot;.

The story revisits the religious themes introduced in &quot;Emissary&quot;, the series premiere. &quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot; provides a deeper focus on Bajoran politics and religion and highlights what happens when the values and beliefs of one culture are imposed on another. The episode features the first appearances of Louise Fletcher and Philip Anglim in their recurring roles as Vedek Winn and Vedek Bareil. 8.8 million people viewed the episode on its first broadcast, the lowest of any first-run episode during season one. Critical reception to the episode was positive, with Fletcher and Avery Brooks receiving praise for their performances.

==Plot==
Chief Miles O&#x27;Brien (Colm Meaney) walks his wife Keiko (Rosalind Chao) to the school where she teaches students on the station. They discuss Bajoran culture, a topic Miles learned about from Neela (Robin Christopher), his Bajoran assistant. At the school, Keiko teaches her class about the science of the Bajoran wormhole and the aliens that live inside it. This scientific view is different from the religious approach taken by the Bajorans, who believe the wormhole is the legendary Celestial Temple inhabited by their &quot;Prophets&quot;, whom they worship as gods. Her class is interrupted by one of Bajor&#x27;s spiritual leaders, Vedek Winn (Louise Fletcher). Winn questions why Keiko does not teach Bajoran religion in her classroom. Afterwards, Keiko reports the incident to Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks). When Sisko asks Winn about the dispute, she says there may be consequences if Keiko refuses to teach religion. Meanwhile, Miles discovers an important engineering tool is missing, but is distracted when he and Neela discover the remains of a Starfleet ensign.

Outside the school, Winn and a group of Bajorans protest Keiko&#x27;s teaching methods. Winn offers Keiko a solution—all she has to do is simply stop teaching about the wormhole. When Keiko refuses to accept Winn&#x27;s proposal, Winn leads the Bajoran parents to take their children out of school. Sisko visits Vedek Bareil (Philip Anglim), a more progressive Bajoran cleric, for advice on the problem. Bareil opposes Winn&#x27;s views but he cannot support Sisko as he is attempting to become the next Kai, the leader of the Bajoran religion. Sisko returns to DS9 and asks for help from Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), his Bajoran first officer, but she also refuses to help. Meanwhile, security chief Odo (René Auberjonois) and Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) finish investigating the remains of the Starfleet ensign Miles and Neela found earlier. They discover that the ensign was murdered by a phaser when he became aware of someone tampering with the Runabout security controls.

Later, an explosion occurs inside the empty school, destroying it. Sisko confronts Winn, blaming her actions for increasing the risk of violence on the station. Neela meets with Winn, revealing that the two had been working together. She informs Winn that her escape plan with the Runabout will no longer work. Winn tells Neela to continue with the plan, even if it means Neela must sacrifice herself. Bareil arrives at the station to help, and at the same time, Miles and Lt. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) discover a hidden sub-program on the station&#x27;s computer created by Neela. The program controls a timed delay of forcefields running from the promenade to the Runabouts. They alert Sisko who is nearby, just as Bareil and Winn begin to address a crowd of Bajorans on the promenade. Sisko searches the crowd just in time to see Neela raising her phaser at Bareil. Sisko tackles Neela to the ground and saves Bareil&#x27;s life. Kira suggests that the assassination attempt was planned by Winn to secure her position as the new Kai, but Neela insists she was working alone. Kira later apologises to Sisko, and agrees with his earlier sentiment about Winn&#x27;s actions.

==Production==
Prior to the scripting of &quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot;, a crossover with the cast of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; was proposed for the season finale. However, this idea was dropped in favor of an episode which would end the season on a religious note similar to &quot;Emissary&quot;, the series premiere. During the writing of the episode, executive producer Michael Piller was concerned that it was not going to be as good as the previous episode, &quot;Duet&quot;. Ira Steven Behr credited this as setting a challenge for the writing team which improved the episode. &quot;It gave us even more grist for the mill than &#x27;Duet&#x27; did, and together they provided a great one-two punch to the end of the first season&quot;, Behr recalled.

The episode marked the debut of Philip Anglim as Vedek Bareil and Louise Fletcher as Vedek Winn. Bareil and Winn became recurring characters throughout the rest of the series. Fletcher was best known for playing the role of Nurse Ratched in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975), for which she received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She did not have to read for the role of Vedek Winn, nor was she familiar with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series or its heritage before accepting the role. Robin Christopher makes her appearance in this episode for the second and last time as Neela, first appearing in the previous episode, &quot;Duet&quot;.

&quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot; is the third episode directed by David Livingston. With a budget larger than most of the other first season episodes, Livingston used more extras which allowed him to create larger crowd scenes. Livingston&#x27;s first location shoot took place during Bareil&#x27;s sanctuary scene on Bajor. Filmed on location at Fern Dell at Griffith Park, Los Angeles, Livingston found it difficult to shoot the scene due to the density of the foliage and access to the dell. This same location previously appeared in the holodeck scenes used in &quot;Encounter At Farpoint&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;.

Filmed in full scale, the school explosion used drywall around the interior of the set to protect it from the fire. Physical effects supervisor Gary Monak oversaw the explosion. The destruction surprised the cast as they were more used to optical effects in the series. Costume designer Robert Blackman created the Vedek costumes. Crew members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.

==Themes==
&quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot; is the first episode in the series to examine the conflict between elements of the Bajoran religion and the secularism of Starfleet. Writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe says the episode maintains the consistency of Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s vision for &quot;Star Trek&quot;:
I have no argument with someone having a fundamentalist belief in Christianity or Islam or Judaism or Buddhism or anything else, but I do have a serious objection to people trying to impose their values on other people. And that&#x27;s what this episode is about. No one has the right to force anyone to believe the things that they believe. That&#x27;s one of the beautiful things about Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s vision of IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations), and that was one of the things that we really wanted to hammer home here. Sisko does everything he can not to impose his values on the Bajorans, but Vedek Winn is determined to impose her values on everyone.

The episode showed the unwillingness of Sisko to accept his position as a religious figure within the Bajoran culture. This theme was first explored in &quot;Emissary&quot;, the pilot of the series. The ongoing theme for Bajoran politics and religion began with &quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot; and ran through the rest of the series. Wolfe was raised as a Catholic, and he attributes the religious theme of the episode to this influence, as well as his interest in history. He compares the religious intrigue of the story to the history of Catholicism in the 15th and 16th century, a time when members of various families jostled for power to become Pope. When asked to describe the character of Winn, Louise Fletcher said, &quot;Think the Pope in space, except she&#x27;s like an ancient Pope, from the old days when Popes were ruthless and powerful and exerted their powers and fought wars and did all kinds of naughty things.&quot;

Matt Rorie in Screened.com said the writers examined the politics of the Bajoran religion by &quot;planting pious but open-minded Bajorans like Kira against the orthodox, intolerant, fundamentalist majority, as represented by Kai Winn, who was willing to bomb schools and attempt assassinations on her political rivals to stay in power.&quot; Zack Handlen in his review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; compared the actions in the episode to the &quot;ideological battles [which] are fought over what&#x27;s appropriate in the classroom&quot; in the United States.

==Reception ==
&quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot; first aired in broadcast syndication on June 20, 1993. It received Nielsen ratings of 8.8 million, placing it in fifth place in the timeslot. It was the least viewed episode of the first season during its initial broadcast. This rating was a slight decrease from the previous week&#x27;s episode &quot;Duet&quot;, which received a rating of 8.9 million.

Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. In 2012, Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, noting that while the episode was not subtle, it did &quot;a good job expanding the show&#x27;s world, and playing off of undercurrents and themes which have been built in throughout &quot;DS9&quot; first season.&quot; He described Winn as the &quot;most unsettling of enemies, a true believer whose faith doesn&#x27;t prevent her from manipulation and deceit&quot;. Handlen described the character of Vedek Winn as &quot;terrific&quot; and was overall positive about the ensemble cast, saying &quot;Avery Brooks has tremendous presence and a terrific voice&quot; and &quot;Nana Visitor is great as always.&quot; They suggest the episode &quot;is essentially about the conflicts which arise between cultures even when everyone has the best of intentions.&quot;

Reviewing the episode for TrekNation, Michelle Green wrote that the episode was &quot;pretty fantastic&quot; when she originally watched it. Upon re-watching it years later, she thought it had improved even further. Green described the episode as &quot;a no-holds-barred story about the hypocrisy of religious leaders which seems less influenced by the Scopes Trial than by contemporary creationist politicians.&quot; She described Fletcher as one of her favourite actresses and thought that she portrayed Vedek Winn as the older sister of Nurse Ratched from &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

Jamahl Epsicokhan of Jammer&#x27;s Reviews, said that there was a great deal of plot to cover in the episode and that the strands came together successfully. He singled out Avery Brooks for praise, but thought that there was a number of stand-out performances by the cast. Epsicokhan gave the episode a score of 3.5/4 and thought that it demonstrated the direction that the series intended to go in. 
In 2013, Keith DeCandido for Tor.com gave the episode a rating of 7 out of 10, and praised the performance of Fletcher, calling her &quot;deliciously evil&quot;. He thought that Anglim gave one of his better performances as Vedek Bareil and that the speech by Brooks to Fletcher at the end of the episode was particularly well done.

In 2015, Geek.com recommended this episode as &quot;essential watching&quot; for their abbreviated &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; binge-watching guide, along with &quot;Emissary&quot;, &quot;Past Prologue&quot;, &quot;Vortex&quot;, &quot;Battle Lines&quot;, and &quot;Duet&quot; from the first season. In 2020, io9 listed this as one of the &quot;must-watch&quot; episodes of the series.

== Home media release==

<text>Elías Ricardo Figueroa Brander (born 25 October 1946) is a Chilean former footballer who played for several clubs during his long career, notably his hometown club Santiago Wanderers, Brazilian club Internacional and Uruguayan club Peñarol. He also represented Chile 47 times, appearing in three FIFA World Cups, in 1966, 1974, and 1982.

Regarded by many as one of the greatest defenders in the history of the game, Figueroa was noted for his elegant style of play, his composure in the centre of defense and his ability to cut out opposition attacks and immediately launch counterattacks from the back with his passing. He was also praised throughout his career for being a gentleman on and off the pitch.

He was twice awarded the Bola de Ouro, the Brazilian Player of the year award whilst playing for Internacional in 1972 and 1976. He was also awarded the South American Footballer of the Year three times in a row by Venezuelan newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot; in 1974, 1975 and 1976. He was named Best Player in Uruguay in 1967 and 1968, and Best Player in Chile in 1977 and 1978. After retiring, he was named one of the world&#x27;s 125 best living football players by Pelé in 2004, and was also voted 8th best South American and 37th best player in the world of the 20th Century by the IFFHS in 1999.

==Early life and youth career==

Figueroa was born in Valparaíso, Chile on 25 October 1946. He began playing football in Chile with Florida High Quilpué, and later joined the youth system of his hometown club Santiago Wanderers in 1962.

==Club career==
===Early career in Chile===
Figueroa began his professional career in 1963, when, at the age of 16, he appeared in the first division of the Chilean professional football league, playing for the Santiago Wanderers first team. He was later sent on loan to Unión La Calera in 1964. Later that year, aged 17, he was called up to the Chile national youth team.

===Success with Peñarol===
His performances attracted interest from several foreign teams, and following the South American Championship in Montevideo in 1967, he was acquired by Uruguayan side Peñarol later that year. At that time this Uruguayan Club was the best team in the world as champion of the Intercontinental Cup (football) and the Uruguayan league was very strong. Figueroa settled in a team full of stars and legends, but he with 18 years was elected the best player in the Uruguayan Championship 1967 and also 1968 and 1971. He spent several years with the Peñarol, where he experienced one of his most successful periods in domestic football. He won the Uruguayan Championship with the club in 1967, 1968 and 1969 and in his farewell at the end of 1971, people cried at the airport.

===Continued success with Internacional===

By then Figueroa had established himself as a well-developed and highly regarded athlete; however, he was looking to develop his skills further, and his talents caught the attention of Brazilian executives. He was acquired by Brazilian club Internacional de Porto Alegre in 1972, where he had an equally successful spell, winning the Brazilian championship in 1975 and 1976, and also winning five Campeonato Gaúcho Championships with the team; in 1974, the club won all of their 18 games to claim the title. Elias Figueroa was the central figure of the team, and is well remembered by the club&#x27;s fans for his famous &quot;Illuminated goal&quot; in the club&#x27;s victory over Cruzeiro in the 1975 &quot;Brasileirao&quot; final. He was elected the Brazilian league&#x27;s best central defender during the 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976 seasons, winning the Bola de Prata, and was voted the Brazilian League&#x27;s Player of the Year in 1975 and 1976, winning the Bola de Ouro Award. He won further acclaim when he succeeded Pelé in being named the South American Footballer of the Year in 1974, 1975 and 1976, fighting off competition from several other world class South American footballers, such as his teammate Falcão, as well as Rivellino, Jairzinho, Carlos Alberto Torres, Zico, Nelinho, Marinho Chagas, Teófilo Cubillas, Héctor Chumpitaz, Mario Kempes, Roberto Perfumo, and Daniel Passarella.

===Later career in Chile and the United States===
Shortly after his time in Brazil, Figueroa returned to his homeland in 1977, joining Palestino, with whom he won the Chile National Championship in 1977 and 1978, also being named the Best Player in Chile in both of those seasons. Like many prominent ageing figures in world football at the time, in 1981 he went to the United States, where he played in the North American Soccer League for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. Finally, he returned to Chile once again later that year, transferring to Colo-Colo in Santiago, where he ended his career. In 1982, after a 20-year career, he officially retired from professional football. In total he amassed an impressive 22 titles.

==International career==
Figueroa earned 47 caps and scored two goals for the Chilean senior national team between 1966 and 1982.

He was the captain of the Chile national side on many occasions, and even captained the Chilean squad through their most successive era to date, when they qualified for three World Cups. He played in the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, and also featured prominently in the 1974 FIFA World Cup in Germany, where he was elected the best central defender of the tournament, despite Chile&#x27;s poor performance in the competition. He also later took part in the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. In 1974 Figueroa was elected the best central defender of the tournament and member of the all-star team of World Cup.

He was also captain when they finished third in the South American Championship 1967 and a remarkable second place in the Copa América 1979.

==Playing style==
Known as &quot;Don Elías&quot;, Figueroa was noted for having a keen ability to anticipate attacks as a defender with his great reading of the game and tight marking ability. Figueroa also had the ability to start counter-attacks from the back-line thanks to his composure on the ball, vision, and good range of passing. His playing style as a sweeper was frequently compared to Franz Beckenbauer, but while the German often looked for long, killer balls upfield, Figueroa typically used shorter, incisive passes to spring his teammates forward. Figueroa was also a threat in the final third of the pitch, often marauding forward to lay on goals for other players or strike on goal with his powerful shot. Figueroa remembers: &quot;when I played in Brazil, I always did a play in which the wing back and the winger retained the ball while I would advance unmarked and make a central attacking run&quot;. Possessing good technical skills, Figueroa was also a physical presence, good in the air, and strong in one-on-one situations as a central defender. Known for his leadership, he also had a reputation of being a clean and fair player. Only once in his entire career was he shown a red card and was selected as captain for every team he played for. According to journalist Nelson Rodrigues, Figueroa was &quot;elegant, as an earl dressed in suit, and dangerous as a Bengal Tiger. Elias Figueroa was the perfect defender.&quot;

==After retirement==
===Punditry===
After retiring, Figueroa later became a television sports commentator for Chilean and Brazilian football, and was also successful in his new profession.

===Coaching career===
In December 2006, Figueroa served as coach when Chile played a friendly game against Aragon.

===Potential FIFA Presidential Run===
On 25 March 2011, Figueroa was chosen as ChangeFIFA&#x27;s candidate to clean up FIFA following the scandal-hit 2018 and 2022 World Cup bid race last year. Unless Figueroa is nominated by a national federation, FIFA president Sepp Blatter&#x27;s only opponent in the elections on 1 June will be Asian football chief Mohamed Bin Hammam. ChangeFIFA co-director David Larkin said that if FIFA members denied one of their own legendary players the right to stand for president, &quot;it will only prove to show that FIFA has become an exclusive and undemocratic club of an elite few who will stop at nothing to prevent their loss of privilege and power&quot;. Figueroa told Brazil&#x27;s leading sports newspaper, &quot;Lance!&quot;: &quot;My idea, which is also theirs, is to change some things in football, make it better. I still cannot give details, but, if the nomination is confirmed, we will reveal.&quot;

However, on 31 March 2011, Figueroa said in a statement he had decided not to accept because &quot;in such a short period of time I could not develop a case worthy of the magnitude and importance of such a distinguished job&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1999 Figueroa received the honorable mention of being one of the top eleven players from Latin America and in the same year he was part of a select group of the Great Masters Cup in a ceremony held in Cannes, France.

His time playing in Brazil was so successful that some local journalists divided his career in the South American nation &quot;before and after Figueroa.&quot; Single lineage heads the list of all Chilean players to date.

In April 2002, she was appointed by the &quot;Standing Committee on Language Education and Research&quot; (SCOLAR) as the &quot;Ambassador of The Workplace English Campaign&quot; to encourage the working people to keep studying the English language as Chen herself had done. 

After years of serving other funds, Chen started her own to help children: the Kelly Chen Children Education Fund raises money to help needy children. Besides performing her Dynacarnival concert in Hong Kong, Chen travelled to Sydney and Melbourne, Australia to perform. Chen was soon appointed by the Hong Kong Correctional Services Department as the &quot;Ambassador of The Rehabilitation&quot;.

She was awarded two honours. First, she was chosen as one of Hong Kong&#x27;s Ten Outstanding Young Persons 2002. That same year, she was invited to represent Hong Kong to attend the ABU Prizes – Presentation &amp; Special Concert in the NHK Hall in Tokyo. She received the 13th Annual Best Dressed Award in Japan, becoming the first foreigner to receive the award. She was later invited by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data and HKSAR Government Health Department to film the publicity campaigns for promoting the respect of personal privacy and organ donation throughout China and Hong Kong.

===Children&#x27;s causes===
She was appointed by UNICEF as the Honorable China Children&#x27;s Health Ambassador. Chen was later appointed by the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association as &quot;Girl Guides Millennium Goodwill Ambassador&quot;, which led her to visit Inner Mongolia to investigate the way young children were living and the health and food services they were receiving. In 2001, Chen added another title to her growing list as the Volunteer Ambassador 2001 as appointed by the Social Welfare Department. She was later appointed by UNICEF a second time as the Ambassador of The Hong Kong Committee For UNICEF.

===Other charitable work===
As an ambassador of the Hong Kong Red Cross, Chen promoted the donation of blood banks. She was an ambassador for the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC).

March 2003 brought more titles Chen&#x27;s way: she was appointed The Philatelic Ambassador by the Hong Kong Post, as well as &quot;The Love And Peace Ambassador&quot; by City Junior Chamber. Chen soon took her &quot;Dynacarnival&quot; to North America by performing in Atlantic City, Toronto and San Francisco. She began to release DSD versions of her earlier albums, including &quot;Dedicated Lover&quot;. She was later appointed as Star of &quot;Hong Kong Outstanding Students Award&quot; by Lion &amp; Globe Educational Trust, furthering her push for better education. In June 2003, Chen&#x27;s wax figure for the Madam Tussaud Wax Museum was ready and was put on display. She was later invited to be the &quot;Love Ambassador&quot; of &quot;World Children&#x27;s Day at McDonald&#x27;s 2003&quot; by McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Hong Kong. She was appointed as the &quot;Pass-it-On&quot; Ambassador by the Hong Kong Red Cross and attend its Christmas campaign to visit the John. F. Kennedy Center.

Chen&#x27;s charitable work continued into 2004 as she was appointed as the star representative to attend the &quot;5th HK Outstanding Teenagers&quot; election press conference held by Hong Kong Playground Association and RTHK. In February, Chen was appointed as both &quot;Road Safety Vision Ambassador&quot; by the Road Safety Council to promote road safety, and as the &quot;Reading Ambassador&quot; by The Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; Clubs Association of Hong Kong. May 2004 brought the title of &quot;Hospital Play Ambassador&quot; to Chen, as well as the title of &quot;Japanese Promotional Ambassador&quot; by The Japan Society of HK, Consulate General of Japan and RTHK to encourage Hong Kong citizens to learn Japanese. Chen received another award when she was named &quot;The Outstanding Young Persons of the World&quot; in 2004 by the Junior Chamber International, becoming the first Hong Kong female celebrity to be honoured with the award.

In 2007, Chen was appointed as Hong Kong &quot;Innovative Entrepreneur Ambassador&quot; (創意創業大使) and had sung the theme song &quot;Innovation&quot; (創) for the &quot;Innovative Entrepreneur of The Year 2007&quot; (創意創業大賞2007) organised by City Junior Chamber 城市青年商會, Hong Kong. Chen&#x27;s responsibility is to promote the awareness of entrepreneurship to youngsters and to attend the various promotion events organised. She also continued the support of Innovation Entrepreneur in 2008.

After completing her movie, &quot;An Empress and the Warriors&quot; with Leon Lai, Chen headed a concert, called &quot;Love Fighters&quot;, at the HK Coliseum in June 2008. This was her biggest concert headline to date, which featured many sets and exotic choreography.

Chen donated $600,000 for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

==Media and public relations==
In a survey conducted in 2002 by the City University of Hong Kong, Chen was voted &quot;The Most Popular Idol&quot; by local youth groups.

In 1997, Shiseido hired Chen to appear in their commercials; she was &quot;depicted as [a] modern Asian [beauty], not quite identical yet not totally different from Japanese women.&quot; Chen was also chosen as the cover model for &quot;Ginza&quot;, a new monthly magazine targeted at women in their twenties.

<doc id="612981" wikidata="Q151352" url="?curid=612981" title="Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland">
<text>Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland (20 April 178511 February 1847), styled Earl Percy until 1817, was a British aristocrat and Tory politician who served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland under the Duke of Wellington from 1829 to 1830.

==Background and education==
Northumberland was the son of Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland, and Frances Julia, daughter of Peter Burrell. He was educated at Eton and the University of Cambridge (St John&#x27;s College).

==Political career==
Northumberland entered parliament as the member for Buckingham in July 1806. In September of that year he was elected member for the City of Westminster, on the death of Charles James Fox. He declined to fight the seat at the general election two months later, instead being returned for Launceston. In 1807, he offered himself as a candidate for the county of Northumberland in opposition to Charles, Lord Howick (afterwards the 2nd Earl Grey), who declined to contest the seat. Percy was returned unopposed, and continued to sit until 1812, when he was called to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration by the title Baron Percy.

In 1817, he succeeded his father as Duke of Northumberland. He served as Ambassador Extraordinary at the coronation of Charles X of France in 1825, defraying the expenses thereof himself, and he &quot;astonished the continental nobility of the magnitude of his retinue, the gorgeousness of his equippage, and the profuseness of his liberality&quot;.

In March 1829, he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, a post he held until the following year. He was thus in office when the Catholic Emancipation Act was passed, and was pronounced by Robert Peel &quot;the best chief governor that ever presided over the affairs of Ireland.&quot;

==Other public positions==
In November 1834, Northumberland was elected high Steward of the university of Cambridge, holding that honour until 1840 when he was made chancellor of the university.

He played a prominent role in the establishment of the Church Building Society responsible for building the so-called &quot;Waterloo churches&quot; during the early 19th century. He proposed the CBS&#x27;s formation at a meeting in the Freemasons&#x27; Hall, London on 6 February 1818, chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Society lobbied parliament to provide funding for a church building programme, and parliament subsequently passed the Church Building Act, voting £l,000,000 to the cause.

He also played a part in the development of football in a time when it was a controversial game by providing a field for the annual Alnwick Shrove Tuesday game and presenting the ball before the matcha ritual that continues to this day. Between 1817 and 1847 he held the honorary post of Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland.

==Family==
Northumberland married Lady Charlotte Clive, daughter of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis, and the mineral collector Henrietta Clive, Countess of Powis on 29 April 1817 at Northumberland House. They had no children.

Northumberland died at Alnwick in February 1847, aged 61. His remains were interred in the Northumberland Vault within Westminster Abbey on 23 February.

He was succeeded by his younger brother, Lord Prudhoe. In August 1851, an altar monument to the Duke was placed in St Paul&#x27;s Church, Alnwick.

The city&#x27;s history dates from 230 BCE with the era of the Mauryas and Satavahanas who ruled most of what is now Andhra Pradesh. A few inscriptions dating to the Satavahana period have been found in China Ganjam, a village near Ongole. According to the historical inscriptions available at Sri Raja Rajeswara Swami Temple complex, the city was founded by Cholas. Ongole is also mentioned in the inscriptions of the Pallava rulers of the third and fourth century A.D. The city was also ruled by Krishna Deva Raya. This place came into the limelight again during the Kakatiya dynasty, when the nearby towns of Motupalli and Vodarevu served as major seaports. The last dynasty to rule the Ongole region before the British was the Mandapati dynasty (zamindars). Kaasi Visweswara Swami temple, Chenna Kesava Swami Temple and Veeranjaneya Swami temple were built in the early 17th century by King Vankayalapati mantri and his chief of army.

Andhra Baptist Mission High School founded in the late 19th century by American Baptist missionaries, is the oldest educational institution in the city.

Ongole district came into existence on 2 February 1970, with the carving out portions of Markapur revenue division from Kurnool, Ongole revenue division from Guntur and Kandukur revenue division from Nellore districts. It was renamed as Prakasam district in 1972 in memory of freedom fighter, later Chief Minister of the composite Madras State and the first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh State, Tanguturi Prakasam, who was born at Vinodarayunipalem, a hamlet of Kanuparthi village of Naguluppalapadu mandal of this district.

== Geography ==

<text>James O. Page JD (August 7, 1936 – September 4, 2004) was recognized as a leading authority on United States emergency medical services (EMS). James was born in Alhambra, California, and frequently moved between California and Kansas as a youth. After holding a number of jobs, including an ambulance attendant in East Los Angeles, he received his first job in the fire service with Monterey Park Fire Department. After failing a medical clearance with Los Angeles City Fire Department Page served in the Los Angeles County Fire Department for 16 years rising to the rank of Battalion Chief. While working with the department, he began his studies in law at Southwestern Law School. Recognizing an opportunity, management in the Los Angeles County Fire Department placed problematic firefighters under Page&#x27;s supervision hoping that his litigious training would hasten their dismissal. However, Page refused to serve as the department&#x27;s &quot;executioner.&quot;

In 1973 he was appointed as the first director of North Carolina&#x27;s statewide EMS system. North Carolina gained a national reputation for excellence in pre-hospital care during his tenure. In 1975, he was appointed as Executive Director of Lakes Area Emergency Medical Services in Buffalo, NY and spearheaded the development and implementation of the 8-county western New York EMS system.

During the early 1970s Jim Page served as a technical advisor for NBC Television&#x27;s popular show &quot;Emergency!&quot; This program captured the US public&#x27;s imagination and created a public demand for quality pre-hospital care. In 1976 Page took the leadership reins of the ACT Foundation becoming a popular public speaker, advisor, and author of topics in emergency medicine. The character of Johnny Gage, a paramedic that appeared on the series, was considered to have been named in honor of Page.

Page published several books and magazines about the EMS community.

<doc id="612995" wikidata="Q15134248" url="?curid=612995" title="Synroc">
<text>Synroc, a portmanteau of &quot;synthetic rock&quot;, is a means of safely storing radioactive waste. It was pioneered in 1978 by a team led by Professor Ted Ringwood at the Australian National University, with further research undertaken in collaboration with ANSTO at research laboratories in Lucas Heights.

==Manufacture==
Synroc is composed of three titanate minerals – hollandite, zirconolite and perovskite – plus rutile and a small amount of metal alloy. These are combined into a slurry to which is added a portion of high-level liquid nuclear waste. The mixture is dried and calcined at to produce a powder.

The powder is then compressed in a process known as hot isostatic pressing (HIP), where it is compressed within a bellows-like stainless steel container at temperatures of .

The result is a cylinder of hard, dense, black synthetic rock.

==Comparisons==
If stored in a liquid form, nuclear waste can enter the environment and the waterways, and cause widespread damage. As a solid, these risks are greatly minimised.

Unlike borosilicate glass, which is amorphous, Synroc is a ceramic that incorporates the radioactive waste into its crystal structure. Naturally occurring rocks can store radioactive materials for long periods. The aim of Synroc is to imitate this by converting liquid into a crystalline structure and use to store radioactive waste. Synroc-based glass composite materials (GCM) combine the process and chemical flexibility of glass with the superior chemical durability of ceramics and can achieve higher waste loadings.

Different types of Synroc waste forms (ratios of component minerals, specific HIP pressures and temperatures etc.) can be developed for the immobilisation of different types of waste. Only zirconolite and perovskite can accommodate actinides. The exact proportions of the main phases vary depending on the HLW composition. For example, Synroc-C is designed to contain about 20% by weight of calcined HLW and it consists of approximately (% by weight): 30 – hollandite; 30 – zirconolite; 20 – perovskite and 20 – Ti-oxides and other phases. Immobilising weapons-grade plutonium or transuranium wastes instead of bulk HLW may essentially change the Synroc phase composition to primarily zirconolite-based or a pyrochlore-based ceramic. The starting precursor for Synroc-C fabrication contains ~57% by weight TiO2 and 2% by weight metallic Ti. The metallic titanium provides reducing conditions during ceramic synthesis and helps decrease volatilisation of radioactive cesium.

Synroc is not a disposal method. Synroc still has to be stored. Even though the waste is held in a solid lattice and prevented from spreading, it is still radioactive and can have a negative effect on its surroundings. Synroc is a superior method of nuclear waste storage because it minimises leaching.

==Production use==

In 1997 Synroc was tested with real HLW using technology developed jointly by ANSTO and the US DoE&#x27;s Argonne National Laboratory. 
In January 2010, the United States Department of Energy selected hot isostatic pressing (HIP) for processing waste at the Idaho National Laboratory.
In April 2008, the Battelle Energy Alliance signed a contract with ANSTO to demonstrate the benefits of Synroc in processing waste managed by Batelle as part of its contract to manage the Idaho National Laboratory.
Synroc was chosen in April 2005 for a multimillion-dollar &quot;demonstration&quot; contract to eliminate of plutonium-contaminated waste at British Nuclear Fuel&#x27;s Sellafield plant, on the northwest coast of England.

<text>The Ryan XF2R Dark Shark was an American experimental aircraft built for the United States Navy that combined turboprop and turbojet propulsion. It was based on Ryan Aeronautical&#x27;s earlier FR Fireball, but replaced the Fireball&#x27;s piston engine with a turboprop engine.

==Design and development==
The XF2R Dark Shark was based on Ryan Aeronautical&#x27;s earlier FR Fireball, but replaced the Fireball&#x27;s piston engine with a General Electric T31 turboprop engine driving a 4-bladed Hamilton Standard propeller. The turboprop made for much improved performance over the Fireball, and Ryan proposed the XF2R-2 to use a Westinghouse J34 turbojet in place of the General Electric J31 used as the auxiliary turbojet for the XF2R-1. The XF2R-2 also had a squared-off vertical stabilizer and jet intakes moved to the sides of the forward fuselage with NACA ducts instead of the inlets in the wing leading edge for the XF2R-1.

Although the Dark Shark proved to be a capable aircraft, it never progressed beyond the prototype stage and the XF2R-2 was canceled without being built because the Navy had abandoned the idea of the combination fighter and was instead looking into all-jet fighters, which it considered superior.

<text>The Annoyance Theatre, or Annoyance Productions, is a theatre and associated ensemble based in Chicago, Illinois, that deals mainly in absurd and outrageous humor. Many people who have performed with the ensemble have gone on to become successful stage and screen actors. Popular productions have included &quot;Co-Ed Prison Sluts&quot; and &quot;That Darned Antichrist&quot;. Annoyance Productions currently runs classes in improvisation, writing, musical improvisation, acting, and solo work.

== History ==
The Annoyance Theatre was founded by Mick Napier as &quot;Metraform&quot; in 1987 and changed its name to the Annoyance after moving into a new building in 1989. The Annoyance moved again in 1994 to a theater on the 3700 block of North Clark Street, where it would remain for six years. In 2000 the Annoyance was forced to move out so the building could be demolished to make room for a temporary parking lot for nearby Wrigley Field, which was later the site of a mixed commercial/residential building containing a Blockbuster Video. At the time of its closing in 2000, &quot;Co-Ed Prison Sluts&quot;, a musical comedy with a frequently rotating cast, was the longest-running musical comedy in Chicago, having played for 11 years. The Annoyance took up residence in a new building in 2002, and signed a lease for an Uptown location in 2004.

In 2013 the theatre announced that they would be moving from their Uptown Chicago location to their current home at 851 W. Belmont in the Lakeview district of Chicago.

==Past productions==
In 1992 the Annoyance opened a show called &quot;The Real Live Brady Bunch&quot;, in which a troupe of performers, with an eye toward irony, acted out entire episodes of the 1960s and &#x27;70s family sitcom &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. The show was hugely successful, riding the wave of 1970s nostalgia that came in part to define the 1990s and continues to this day. &quot;What Every Girl Should Know... An Ode to Judy Blume&quot; was another popular show and even gained the respect and approval of author Judy Blume. Throughout the late 1990s iconic film director John Waters and comedian Charlie Callas made appearances at the Annoyance.

The Annoyance opened a new theatre and bar in July 2006 in the Uptown area of Chicago. That location opened with a production of &quot;President Bush is a Great Man&quot;, directed by Mick Napier.

In October 2006, the theatre revived their very first show, &quot;Splatter Theatre&quot;, first performed in 1987. This has become a Halloween tradition at the theater.

In July 2008, the theater revived their flagship show, &quot;Co-Ed Prison Sluts&quot;, first performed in April 1988. September 2014, the Annoyance Theater produced &quot;Good Morning Gitmo,&quot; a one act comedy by Mishu Hilmy and Eric Simon about Guantanamo Bay Detention Center.

The last performance at the Uptown theatre location was on August 24, 2013. The first performance at the Belmont space was Napier&#x27;s &quot;Invisible World&quot; on Saturday May 24, 2014 and the company continues to produce original material created by their own ensemble.

In February 2015, the theatre produced the &quot;Gobbler’s Knob: Groundhog Day Spectacular&quot;, an annual variety show celebrating Groundhog&#x27;s Day.  The show was created by Tom Troup and Christopher Kervick and starred Tim Heurlin as the mayor of Punxsutawney, PA.

<text>Fuente de Piedra Lagoon is a wetland located in the Málaga province of Spain. It is used by the greater flamingo for its annual reproduction cycle, constituting the largest colony on the Iberian Peninsula of this bird. The lagoon is fed by underwater springs that pass through mineral salt deposits, so the lagoon is saline - indeed salt was harvested until recently.

The lagoon covers an area of . It is elliptical in shape. Its major axis is and the minor one is . However it is very shallow; in a good year it is less than deep at its deepest point.

Evaporation is a major factor for the lagoon. The flamingos need a certain amount of water to breed and will desert the eggs if the lagoon dries out too soon. 

In April 2023, due to drought, the lake dried up and turned into a salt pan, interrupting the flamingos breeding cycle and forcing them to leave the lake earlier than usual.

<doc id="613019" wikidata="Q1134044" url="?curid=613019" title="Bellerive Oval">
<text>Bellerive Oval, currently known as Ninja Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a cricket oval and Australian rules football ground located in Bellerive, a suburb on the eastern shore of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. With a seating capacity of 20,000, it is the second-largest stadium in Tasmania, behind York Park in Launceston, which holds 21,000 spectators. Bellerive Oval is the only Tasmanian venue that regularly hosts international cricket matches.

The stadium serves as the home ground for the Tasmanian Tigers, Tasmania&#x27;s state cricket team, and the Hobart Hurricanes, a Big Bash League franchise. It has hosted international Test matches since 1989 and One-Day Internationals (ODIs) since 1988. 

In addition to cricket, Bellerive Oval is a secondary home ground for the North Melbourne Football Club, an Australian Football League (AFL) team that plays three home games per season at the venue. Significant redevelopment projects have expanded the stadium&#x27;s facilities to meet the requirements of high-profile events and increase spectator comfort.

==History==
Football and cricket first started being played in the area where Bellerive Oval is now in the mid-to-late 19th century. In 1884, the first football match on record from the area was played between Carlton and Bellerive. In 1913, the piece of land located between Bellerive Beach and Church and Derwent streets was sold to the Clarence Council. One year later, the new Bellerive recreation ground was ready for use.

The ground was largely unchanged until the mid-1980s. During this time, there was a hump in the centre of the ground, making only the top halves of players visible from the other side of the ground. There was a shed for players, located where the main pavilion now stands. There was a hill on the outer (where the hill now is) that could accommodate two rows of vehicles; the small scoreboard stood on the outer, close to where the electronic scoreboard is now, and the time clock sat about halfway up a training light tower. Until very recently, the police booth sat in the north-east corner of the oval. A concrete cricket pitch served local junior teams until the 1956/57 season, when it was replaced by a turf wicket.

In 1948, when the Clarence Football Club – a tenant of the ground – applied to join the Tasmanian Football League, the ground had to upgrade to TFL standards.

Some minor upgrades were made in the 1960s: clubrooms were built in 1961 and in 1963, a small grandstand (seating about 500) and new public address system were installed.

In 1977, Tasmania gained admission into the Sheffield Shield and the TCA planned to move to a new oval, away from its headquarters at the TCA Ground on the Domain. Bellerive Oval was chosen ahead of KGV Oval and North Hobart Oval. $2.2 million was spent building new grandstands, training nets, a hill, new surface and centre wicket. The old TCA Ground scoreboard was relocated there and the centrepiece three-level members&#x27; pavilion was constructed.

The newly refurbished ground was opened in 1986 for a TFL Statewide League roster match between Clarence and Hobart, which Clarence won in front of a crowd of 3,562. Significant damage to the newly laid turf resulted in no more football matches being scheduled for that season.

The move was made in 1987 under TCA Chairman Denis Rogers, in time for the ground’s first international match—between Sri Lanka and New Zealand—on 12 January 1988, before a crowd of 6,500.

The first Test match in Tasmania was played at Bellerive from 16 to 20 December 1989, between Australia and Sri Lanka. Shortly afterwards, the new electronic scoreboard and Northern Stand were erected.

In 2007, the venue saw the Tasmanian Tigers win the state&#x27;s first Sheffield Shield and in 2008, the ground hosted its first One-Day Cup final, also won by Tasmania.

The oval became the first top-class cricket facility in Australia to sign a naming-rights sponsor in October 2011. A naming rights agreement with Blundstone Footwear resulted in the oval being renamed Blundstone Arena, which was temporarily discontinued during the ground&#x27;s use in the 2015 Cricket World Cup.

In 2023, Bellerive Oval saw further updates, which were particularly focused on improving accessibility and sustainability. The oval adopted several eco-friendly initiatives, including solar panels on the roofs of both the Ricky Ponting Stand and David Boon Stand, reducing its carbon footprint by 20%. These sustainability efforts were part of a broader push by Cricket Tasmania to modernise its venues and reduce environmental impact during large-scale events.

In October 2024, SharkNinja commenced a four-year naming rights deal, with the venue being renamed Ninja Stadium. 

==Capacity==
Following the completion of the Ricky Ponting Stand in 2015, the stadium’s capacity officially reached 20,000, although temporary seating arrangements during high-demand events such as Big Bash League (BBL) finals and AFL matches have allowed attendance to occasionally exceed this number, with a record of 20,200 set during a Hobart Hurricanes semi-final match in 2023.

==Women&#x27;s sport expansion==
Bellerive Oval has played an increasing role in women’s cricket and AFL, hosting several prominent matches for both the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) and AFLW. In 2023, the oval hosted the WBBL final, attracting 14,500 spectators, the highest ever attendance for a women’s match at the venue. The growth of women&#x27;s sport in Tasmania has been highlighted by this venue&#x27;s importance, particularly with investments into better training facilities for female athletes, such as a dedicated gym and locker room area built in 2022.

==Controversies==
Despite its continued development, Bellerive Oval has not been without controversy. Local residents have increasingly voiced concerns about the impact of larger crowds on the surrounding areas. Parking and traffic remain contentious issues, with local government proposals in 2024 to develop additional parking structures being met with opposition from environmental groups, who argue the new developments will encroach on parkland areas.

==Structures and facilities==

In 1999, the Federal Government announced that it would contribute $5 million to upgrade Bellerive. The TCA added $10 million, on loan from the state government, and the Clarence City Council $1 million, enabling a $16 million upgrade. The first part of this upgrade was the state-of-the-art indoor nets. The 6,000-seat Southern Stand came next, which blocked winds and views of the Derwent, and contained the new media centre. The new Members&#x27; Area was the last of the upgrades, along with new perimeter fence and entry gates. The Members&#x27; Area features press and radio media areas, corporate boxes and lunchrooms, as well as the players areas, members&#x27; bars and TCA offices. The redevelopment was officially opened on 11 January 2003, when an overcrowd of 16,719 (official capacity 16,000) witnessed a thrilling one-day match between Australia and England, the victory going to Australia.

To allow for day-night matches to be played at the venue, four light towers were installed in 2009 for $4.8 million, enabling one-day international (ODI) and Twenty20 cricket matches to be played there. The installation of these lights sparked significant debate from groups both for and against the new towers.

The ground was scheduled for further redevelopment by 2015, with the state government providing $15 million to expand the Southern Stand and Members&#x27; Stand, increasing the ground&#x27;s capacity to over 20,000 for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, along with an Ashes Test in the future, and the possibility of locking-in a long-term commitment for AFL games. AFL Tasmania is also looking at moving its offices to the ground as part of the redevelopment. At the official launch of the renovated stadium, it was announced that the new stand would be named the &quot;Ricky Ponting Stand&quot;, and the existing Southern Stand would be named the &quot;David Boon Stand&quot;.
==Events==
As well as being the home of domestic and international cricket and the Clarence Football Club in the now Tasmanian State League, Bellerive Oval served in 2003 as a home to the Tasmanian Devils in the VFL. The first match attracted the highest VFL roster match crowd since 1986–6,970. The venue also hosted Tasmania&#x27;s two finals matches, with the elimination win against Geelong (4,800) and 10,073 for a semi-final against Port Melbourne, which was won by Port Melbourne.

==North Melbourne==
In 2010, talk of Melbourne-based Australian Football League (AFL) clubs shifting home games to Bellerive Oval surfaced. Richmond were considered the early front-runners, but by July 2010 North Melbourne became the most likely candidate, given their willingness to move more than just two matches.

On 7 June 2011, North Melbourne announced a new three-year deal in partnership with transport company Spirit of Tasmania, who announced its intent to sponsor North Melbourne home games in Hobart, at Bellerive Oval. From 2012 to 2014, North Melbourne played two home games per year at the venue. The first game was played 8 April 2012 in Round 2, in which North Melbourne defeated the fledgling Greater Western Sydney Giants by 129 points. The original three-year deal was renewed and extended for a further two years, with Hobart City Council and Spirit of Tasmania agreeing to provide sponsorship for North Melbourne to play three games per year at the venue in 2015 and 2016. A new deal, which did not include the council, was struck in 2016. The arrangement in effect from 2017 to 2021 allowed North Melbourne to continue playing three matches a season at Bellerive Oval, while the current arrangement, effective from 2022, sees North Melbourne play four home games a year.

==Attendance records==

The record attendance for Bellerive Oval before redevelopment was 16,719 for a One Day International between Australia and England on 14 January 2003. The first international match at the venue was a One Day International between New Zealand and Sri Lanka on 12 January 1988 and attracted a then record crowd for an international in Hobart of 6,180.
On 21 February 2010, a Twenty20 International match between Australia and the West Indies attracted a crowd of 15,575. This was the first international day-night cricket match played at Bellerive Oval.

The record attendance at Bellerive Oval since the addition of the Ricky Ponting stand is 18,149 during a 2015–16 BBL match between Hobart Hurricanes and Perth Scorchers on 10 January 2016. The crowd of 17,844 for an AFL game in 2016 between and on 3 June 2016 is the highest crowd ever at Bellerive Oval for an AFL match.

==Transport==
Metro bus services are available to and from Bellerive Oval. Development into an international venue has far outgrown the capacity of local infrastructure to adequately handle the large influxes of patrons attempting to access the venue. In particular, there is little provision for spectator parking. Thus, large numbers of vehicles are parked in the surrounding streets when such events are held, resulting in access issues for local residents and need for traffic-control measures.

In 2023, a ferry service from Brooke Street Pier connecting the Hobart central business district with Bellerive Oval during major events was introduced.

In an attempt to address parking and access issues, development of the oval has encroached upon adjacent properties and in particular the Bellerive Rotary Park situated between the oval and the beach. This park is on land owned by the Clarence Council as is the adjacent oval. As the oval is an exclusive, fenced-off area and the park is an inclusive area open to all residents, many residents reject the encroachment.

<text>Daron Oshay &quot;Mookie&quot; Blaylock (born March 20, 1967) is an American former professional basketball player. He spent 13 years in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the New Jersey Nets, Atlanta Hawks, and the Golden State Warriors.

==College career==
A push-and-pass point guard, Blaylock was rated among the best defensive stoppers in the game. The former Garland High School, Midland College (where he earned NJCAA All American honors in 1987), and University of Oklahoma star is most highly regarded for his quick hands and a ball hawking defensive style that produced more than 200 steals in a season five times and two NBA All-Defensive first-team selections. He was also a capable outside shooter, a fine passer who generally ranked among the league&#x27;s assist leaders, and a durable instigator of the fast break. In 1988, he helped to lead the Sooners to the NCAA title game.

==Professional career==
Blaylock was selected by the New Jersey Nets with the 12th overall pick of the 1989 NBA draft and settled quickly into Nets&#x27; rotation. He was traded with Roy Hinson to the Atlanta Hawks prior to the 1992–93 season for Rumeal Robinson, where he flourished under newly signed coach Lenny Wilkens. He spent seven years with the Hawks, leading them in career three-point field goals (made and attempted) and career steals. He was also selected for the 1994 NBA All-Star Game. He was traded to the Golden State Warriors in a deal that brought Bimbo Coles, Duane Ferrell, and the 1999 10th overall draft pick, Jason Terry, to Atlanta, and finished off his career playing as a reserve for the Warriors.

===NBA achievements===
* Led the NBA in steals two consecutive seasons (1996–97 and 1997–98), joining Alvin Robertson, Magic Johnson, Allen Iverson, and Chris Paul as the only players to achieve that feat.
* Led the NBA in three-point attempts and finished second in three-pointers made in the 1996–97 season.
* Is the Atlanta Hawks&#x27; all-time franchise leader in steals (1,321).
* Set the Atlanta Hawks&#x27; single-season franchise records for three-pointers made (231) and attempted (623) in 1995–96.

==In popular culture==
As fans of the basketball player, the band members of Pearl Jam originally named their group &quot;Mookie Blaylock&quot;, but they were forced to change the name. They settled on naming their debut album &quot;Ten&quot; after Blaylock&#x27;s jersey number.

In Tom Robbins&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas&quot;, character Larry Diamond uses the name &quot;Mookie Blaylock&quot; as a pseudonym for hotel stays.

In the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; cartoon &quot;Kick-A-Ball&quot;, the Umpire tells the Announcer that Mookie Blaylock gave him the ball featured in the cartoon, a reference to a similar scene in an earlier cartoon about Mookie Wilson.
==Personal life==
In 2011, two of Blaylock&#x27;s sons, twins Daron and Zack, committed to play football for the University of Kentucky. The sons are graduates of Walton High School in Marietta, Georgia. His youngest son, Dominick, is also a graduate of Walton High School, and plays football for Georgia Tech, having transferred after previously playing for the University of Georgia. Mookie Betts, an outfielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers, was named after Blaylock. Blaylock resides in Zebulon, Georgia.

During the afternoon of May 31, 2013, Blaylock was involved in a head-on collision in Clayton County, Georgia. He was initially placed on life support, but his condition later improved. Blaylock&#x27;s vehicle traveled left-of-center, causing the accident. A family member stated he had a history of seizures, and although it was unknown if Blaylock was experiencing any symptoms at the time of the collision, he was under doctor&#x27;s orders to not drive due to the seizures. Blaylock had a history of alcohol abuse, and it was determined he suffered a seizure due to alcohol withdrawal. Although initially surviving the crash, a passenger in the other vehicle, Monica Murphy, a mother of five, died as a result of injuries from the collision. Blaylock was charged with vehicular homicide, driving on a suspended license and failing to stay in his lane. Blaylock had an outstanding warrant in Spalding County, Georgia on charges of DUI and drug-related offenses at the time, but &quot;investigators did not believe alcohol was a factor in the crash.&quot; However, Blaylock had a history of DUIs, at least seven of them.

On October 27, 2014, Blaylock pleaded guilty to killing Murphy. Facing seven to 10 years at trial, Blaylock accepted a plea bargain. According to the plea, Blaylock served three years in prison and the fourth as a suspended sentence, followed by eight years of probation.

<text>Little People of America (LPA) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which provides support, resources, and information to individuals with dwarfism and their families.

==Founding==
LPA was founded in 1957 by actor Billy Barty when he informally called upon people of short stature to join him in a get-together in Reno, Nevada. The original association was known as Midgets of America until 1960. The name was later changed to Midgets and Dwarfs of America when the people with dwarfism complained that there were more dwarfs than midgets. That original meeting of 21 people evolved into Little People of America, a group which as of 2023 has more than 7,500 members. LPA has 73 local chapters which meet regularly as well as an annual weeklong conference. They publish a quarterly publication national newsletter titled &quot;LPA Today&quot;. LPA is the first North American &quot;little people&quot; organization, with the Little People of Canada incorporating in Canada in 1984.

==&quot;Midget&quot; as a slur==
During the 2009 National Conference of the Little People of America, a press conference was held to make a public statement regarding the use of the word &quot;midget&quot;, which is considered offensive by many people with dwarfism. The statement was made in response to an episode of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; which featured multiple uses of the word &quot;midget&quot; and justification of it by one of the celebrities, Jesse James. Members of the LPA filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission over the use of the word &quot;midget&quot; on broadcast television. The complaint said that &quot;the word &#x27;midget&#x27; is considered offensive to the dwarfism community and should not be seen or heard on TV or radio.&quot;

==Membership==
Membership in LPA is limited to people 4 ft 10 in (147 cm) and under, or those diagnosed with any of the hundred plus forms of dwarfism, their families, or those who &quot;demonstrate a well-founded interest in issues relating to Little People Matter, and dwarfism.&quot;

<text>The Tasmania men&#x27;s cricket team, nicknamed the Tigers, represents the Australian state of Tasmania in cricket. They compete annually in the Australian domestic senior men&#x27;s cricket season, which consists of the first-class Sheffield Shield and the limited overs Matador BBQs One-Day Cup.

Tasmania played in the first first-class cricket match in Australia against Victoria in 1851, which they won by three wickets. Despite winning their first match, and producing many fine cricketers in the late 19th century, Tasmania was overlooked when the participants in Australian first-class tournament known as the Sheffield Shield were chosen in 1892. For nearly eighty years the Tasmanian side played an average of only two or three first-class matches per year, usually against one of the mainland Australian teams, or warm-up matches against a touring international test team.
The English &quot;bodyline&quot; team of the 1930s played Tasmania in Launceston

Tasmania were finally admitted to regular competitions when they became a founding member of the Gillette Cup domestic one day cricket tournament upon its inception in 1969. They have performed well in it, winning it four times, and having been runners-up twice. It took a further eight seasons before Tasmania were admitted into the Sheffield Shield in 1977–78, and it was initially on a reduced fixtures list, but by the 1979–80 season, they had become full participants, and slowly progressed towards competitiveness within the tournament, first winning in the 2006–07 season—after almost 30 years in the competition. In the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash the Tigers have yet to win, but were runners-up in 2006–07.

Tasmania play their limited overs cricket in a predominantly green uniform, with red and gold as their secondary colours, and have a Tasmanian tiger as their team logo. They play home matches at Bellerive Oval, Clarence on Hobart&#x27;s Eastern Shore, though matches are occasionally played at venues in Devonport and Launceston.

==History==

===Introduction of cricket to Tasmania===
Cricket almost certainly has been played in Tasmania since the time of European settlement in 1803. It was a popular pastime among marines, who were responsible for security in the fledgling colony. The first recorded match is known to have taken place in 1806, although it is most likely that unrecorded matches were already being played at this time. According to the colony&#x27;s chaplain, and famed diarist, Robert Knopwood by 1814 the game had become very popular, especially around the festive season at Christmas.

By the 1820s there had still not been any official club organisation, but matches were being played on a regular basis. Cricket is recorded as having been played in the settlements at Richmond, Clarence Plains, Kempton, Sorell, in the Macquarie Valley west of Campbell Town, Westbury, Evandale, Longford and Hadspen.

Many of these matches seem to have been organised between hotel licensees, in order to create profits through the sale of food and beverages, and through betting on the outcome. One such match that was arranged in March 1826 by Joseph Bowden, the hotelier of the Lamb Inn on Brisbane Street was played for a winner&#x27;s purse of 50 guineas between &quot;Eleven Gentlemen from the Counties of Sussex and Kent against the choice of the whole Island of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot;.

There is no evidence to suggest an &quot;official cricket season&quot; during the first two decades of the colony, and many of these games initially seem to have been played around June and July, to coincide with the traditional English cricket season, rather than the Tasmanian summer. Accounts of such matches suggest games were often played in atrocious conditions due to winter rains and cold conditions. But by the 1830s, logic had prevailed and cricket seems to have reverted to the southern summer months. Club cricket had also become well-established by the 1830s. One of the earliest men responsible for organising cricket within the colony was John Marshall, who was established the Hobart Town Club soon after his arrival from England. Soon after in 1835 the Derwent Cricket Club was formed making it the oldest surviving cricket club in Tasmania, and in 1841, the Launceston Cricket Club was formed, making it the second oldest surviving cricket club in Tasmania, and third oldest in Australia. Cricket had soon also spread into many regional settlements throughout the Colony of Tasmania, making it one of the most popular pastimes there. Some matches were played as part of district festivals, with large banquets following play.

===Beginnings of first-class cricket in Australia===

By the late 1840s organised cricket was doing well in both Hobart and Launceston, and was spreading throughout the colony. In 1850 the first &quot;North&quot; versus &quot;South&quot; match was held in Oatlands, midway between Hobart and Launceston, and won by the South. The success of the match prompted promoters to organise an inter-colonial match, and the inaugural first-class cricket match played in Tasmania, which was also the first ever first-class cricket match in Australia, was played in 1851 between Victoria and Tasmania in Launceston at the Launceston Racecourse. The game was billed as &quot;The Gentlemen of Port Phillip versus the Gentlemen of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot;. The game featured four-ball overs and no boundaries, attracted a crowd of about 2500 spectators, and it was a timeless match, but only lasted for two days. Tasmania emerged victorious by three wickets.

===Geographic and social isolation===
Despite winning the first ever first-class match in the Australian colonies, Tasmania felt its geographic isolation in the form of a lack of competition. Few touring sides wished to undertake the long sea journey to the island in the late 19th century. The game also developed more slowly, with Tasmanian clubs maintaining a belief in amateurism at a time when mainland clubs were turning to professionals to further their development. Also a lack of innovation stymied progress. The Victorian side that visited in 1858 had adopted the new round arm form of bowling, and it demolished the Tasmanian batting order unused to the technique. The population decline of the 1850s as Tasmanians moved to the Victorian goldfields also had a negative effect on the quality of players Tasmania could select.

Despite the problems facing Tasmanian cricket, local teams did occasionally play against competitive sides. The English tourists of 1861–62, played against Tasmania, winning by four wickets. Tasmania played against Victoria three times in the early 1870s, but lost all three matches, convincing the Victorians that Tasmania was not suitably competitive. Tasmania did not play another first-class match until 1877, when it travelled to Adelaide to take on South Australia.

The 1880s provided better progress for the colony. In 1880 the TCA Ground had been established, providing a permanent ground to play on in the colony&#x27;s capital, Hobart. The establishment of an organised regular local competition led to improvement in the quality of players. John Davies, owner of local newspaper &quot;The Mercury&quot;, was a keen cricket fan, and through personal connections, he arranged various touring English sides to visit the colony, and victory for Tasmania against the English tourists in 1887–88 led to Victoria resuming competition with Tasmania.

In the 1890s, the colony was playing representative cricket against Victoria almost every year, and occasionally against New South Wales as well. The colony could also boast genuinely first-class quality players, such as Kenneth Burn, Charles Eady, and Edward Windsor, the first two of whom played test cricket for Australia. However, the retirement of Eady and Burn by 1910, and in-fighting between Hobart and Launceston again threatened first-class cricket in Tasmania. The outbreak of World War I also saw a large loss of playing talent, killed on the battlefields. Cricket was suspended during the war, and did not resume until 1923, albeit with severe financial problems.

===Sheffield Shield wilderness===

Following World War I, Tasmanian representative sides usually had to content themselves with matches against touring international sides during brief stopovers, while they travelled by ship to mainland capitals. Occasionally Tasmania would play the odd game against mainland state sides, but it was usually only one first-class match per season. One notable visit was by the Jardine &quot;bodyline&quot; team in 1931, where they played Tasmania at the NTCA ground - England won.

The inter-war years proved a period of consolidation for Tasmania, as the state struggled to recover from the devastation of the war. Club cricket was hampered by rivalry between the south, north and north-west. Several exceptional cricketers emerged in this period, such as Laurie Nash, Jack Badcock, though a lack of opportunity led many to pursue cricket careers on the mainland. The quality of cricket in Tasmania varied from time to time, but after World War II the standard was high. Cricket resumed much faster than it had done after World War I, and excellent players such as Ronald Morrisby, Emerson Rodwell, and Bernard Considine emerged. This prompted moves to be made by the Tasmanian Cricket Association for further matches and recognition.

Despite the skills of Rodwell and Terence Cowley, Tasmania struggled to beat Victoria in the 1950s. As a result, the Victorian Cricket Association decided to end the regular matches against Tasmania, and the English tourists also decided to downgrade matches against the state to second-class status. As a result, the Tasmanian Cricket Association made a first attempt to join the Sheffield Shield in 1964, but was rejected. The Australian Cricket Board of Control outlined areas in which the state&#x27;s administration would need to be improved before Tasmania could participate in the Shield. Despite this, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia supported Tasmania by sending full-strength sides to take on the state as warm-ups to their Shield campaigns over the following few years. When the domestic one day competition was established in 1969, Tasmania was granted full playing status.

The arrival of Lancashire all rounder Jack Simmons in the 1972–73 season proved a turning point in the fortunes of the team. His inspirational captaincy lifted the competitiveness of Tasmania. In the 1974–75 and 1975–76 seasons, Tasmania were losing semi-finalists in the Gillette Cup. The Tasmanian team was finally admitted to the Sheffield Shield by the Australian Cricket Board in 1977 on a two-year trial basis, although it played a reduced roster in comparison to the other states. Tasmania&#x27;s points on the ladder were calculated at x5 and /9 due to the fact they only played each other state once (instead of twice) during the season. A famous victory by 84 runs at the TCA Ground against the Indian tourists in 1977 helped the TCA to convince mainland cricket authorities that Tasmanian cricket was nationally competitive.

===National competitiveness===
Simmons had proved an inspirational captain for Tasmania, and although the side only won one of the twelve first-class matches under his leadership, that had more to do with the quality of the homegrown players at the time. His List A cricket record was more successful, leading Tasmania to six victories in eleven matches. He also assisted the TCA in modernising the administration of cricket in the state.

After making the Gillette Cup semi-finals in the 1974–75 and 1975–76 seasons, Tasmania qualified for the final for the first time in the 1977–78 season, but lost to Western Australia at the WACA Ground by seven wickets. A surprise victory came the following year in the 1978–79 Gillette Cup domestic one-day competition, in a repeat of the previous year&#x27;s final. The game was played at the TCA Ground in Hobart, and the home ground advantage proved decisive, with Tasmania beating Western Australia by 47 runs. Within a fortnight Tasmania had won their first Sheffield Shield match, again beating Western Australia, this time by four wickets in Devonport. The victory showed the mainland states Tasmania was capable of competing among the nation&#x27;s best.
The presence of Simmons, and the 1978–79 Gillette Cup victory, had brought attention to Tasmanian cricket, and soon other international professionals joined the state for brief stints to both help out Tasmania&#x27;s development, and gain further experience in Australian conditions. Michael Holding, Winston Davis, Patrick Patterson, Richard Hadlee and Dennis Lillee were among the more notable players to represent Tasmania in the late 1970s and early &#x27;80s.

After finally being admitted to the Sheffield Shield permanently, the Tasmanian side initially struggled for success and consistency, and were the competition&#x27;s whipping-boys throughout the 1980s and early 90s. The rise of a local hero in the form of David Boon, who by 1984 had achieved international fame, showed the country, and the world, that Tasmanian cricket was here to stay. Wicket-keeper Roger Woolley also briefly rose to prominence, representing Australia in two tests, and four One Day Internationals in 1983–84. The pair had become the first Tasmanians to represent Australia at test level since Charles Eady in 1910.

Despite their skills, the Tasmanian side struggled to win throughout this period. Regardless of the lack of competitive success, one exceptionally bright point came with the unearthing of a rare talent in Ricky Ponting, who would go on to become one of the world&#x27;s best batsmen.

===Tasmanian Tigers era===

A reshuffle in the administration and organisation of the TCA in 1991 did not have an immediate effect, but the mid-1990s brought a more professional approach, and the state&#x27;s side re-branded as the Tasmanian Tigers, and with a new headquarters in the renovated Bellerive Oval, the state finally started to achieve more regular success. The side surged to the final for the first time in 1993–94, only to lose to New South Wales, but showed they were capable of successes at first class level. The 1997–98 season saw the Tigers qualify for the final off the back off a remarkable six straight victories, and they were desperately unlucky not to win the competition after such dominance.

In the late 1990s Tasmania continued to produce top level cricketers. Players such as Jamie Cox, Dene Hills, Shaun Young and Michael Di Venuto became stars of the state side, and can all be considered unlucky not to have found a place in the Australian side.

===Recent success===
The Tigers continue to remain competitive in all forms of the Australian domestic game, and in 2006–07 were successful in claiming their first-ever Sheffield Shield title. Five years later, they won the Shield a second time in 2010–11, and again in 2012–13. The Tigers have also qualified for the final on five other occasions in 1993–94, 1997–98, 2001–02 and 2011–12, 2023–24 but had to settle for second place.

The Tigers have fared better in the Ford Ranger Cup, winning it four times in 1978–79, 2004–05, 2007–08, and in 2009–10. They have also been runners-up twice in 1977–78, and 1986–87. The Tigers were also unlucky to finish as runners-up in the second season of the Australian domestic Twenty20 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash competition in 2006–07.

Tasmania&#x27;s recent successes at domestic level have been reflected in selection for the Australian national cricket team. Spinner Jason Krejza played two tests on the back of solid performances for the state, but failed to impress at international level. Brett Geeves was selected in the One Day International squad for 2008, and has since gone on to also play in the Indian Premier League. Fast-bowler Ben Hilfenhaus was included in the national squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and a tour of India, before making his test cricket debut in South Africa in 2009. During the 2009 Ashes series, wicket-keeper Tim Paine was called into the squad as a late replacement for injured reserve wicket-keeper Graham Manou.

Cricket Australia encouraged the state sides to recruit a foreign star for the 2009/10 season, in order to boost the appeal of the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash internationally. Tasmania pulled off one of the biggest coups in this recruitment programme, when they signed Sri Lankan star Lasith Malinga. Disappointingly for the Tigers, Malinga was forced to withdraw due to a change in international commitments for the Sri Lankan side. On 16 November 2009, Cricket Tasmania announced that Dimitri Mascarenhas would replace Malinga as Tasmania&#x27;s overseas player for the 2009/10 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash. However Rana Naved-Ul-Hasan played instead of Mascarenhas. Ul-Hasan also played the following season of the Big Bash.

==Home grounds==


Tasmania have traditionally played cricket both in the state capital Hobart, and Launceston which is the largest city in the north of the state. Cricket was first played on open ground in Hobart, but soon dedicated fields began to be laid out. One such field was the TCA Ground on the Queens Domain. Although it wasn&#x27;t officially opened until 1880, cricket had been played on the site prior to this. From the 1880s however, it became home to both the Tasmanian Cricket Association and the state&#x27;s first-class side. To ensure equal access to the population in the north, Tasmania would often also play home matches at the NTCA Ground in Launceston, which had also hosted the first-ever first-class match in Australia, between Tasmania and Victoria in 1851.

When Tasmania was admitted to the Gillette Cup for the 1969–70 season, they began to spread the matches to a third venue, Devonport Oval in Devonport. The TCA Ground had remained the Tasmanian team&#x27;s official home ground though.

During the re-branding process of the early 1990s, the TCA was faced with a dilemma about their ground. The TCA Ground had a reputation for poor soil and windy conditions, and games were often played in blustery condition with chilly winds blowing off nearby Mount Wellington. The decision was made to move both the offices of the Tasmanian Cricket Association, and the official home ground to Bellerive Oval in Clarence. The decision was a wise one, as it saw test cricket introduced to the state for the first time, and coincided with an improvement in results for the Tasmanian side.

<text>Charles Edward Stuart (November 25, 1810May 19, 1887) was a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan.

==Biography==

Stuart was born in New York, either near Waterloo, New York, or in Columbia County. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1832, and commenced practice in Waterloo. He moved to Michigan in 1835 and settled in Portage, Michigan.

Stuart was a member of the state house of representatives in 1842 and was elected as a Democrat from Michigan&#x27;s 2nd congressional district to the 30th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Edward Bradley. He served in the U.S.House from December 6, 1847, to March 4, 1849, and was defeated for reelection in 1848 by William Sprague. Two years later, he defeated Sprague by being elected to the 32nd Congress, serving from March 4, 1851, to March 3, 1853. He served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State in the 32nd Congress.

Stuart was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1852 and served in the 34th, 35th, and 36th Congresses from March 4, 1853, to March 3, 1859. He was the President pro tempore of the Senate during the 34th Congress, and chairman of the Committee on Public Lands in the 34th and 35th Congresses. He did not seek reelection to the Senate but was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Michigan in 1858. He resumed the practice of law in Kalamazoo and was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention from Michigan.

During the Civil War, Stuart raised and equipped the 13th Michigan Infantry, of which he was commissioned colonel. He later resigned due to ill health.

Charles E. Stuart died in Kalamazoo and was interred in Mountain Home Cemetery. His home in Kalamazoo at 427 Stuart Ave. is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The surrounding Stuart Area Historic District is also listed.

<doc id="613037" wikidata="Q846209" url="?curid=613037" title="After Hours (film)">
<text>After Hours is a 1985 American black comedy film directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Joseph Minion, and produced by Amy Robinson, Griffin Dunne, and Robert F. Colesberry. Dunne stars as Paul Hackett, an office worker who experiences a series of misadventures while attempting to make his way home from Manhattan&#x27;s SoHo district during the night.

&quot;After Hours&quot; was critically acclaimed for its black humor, and is now considered to be a cult classic. As of 2025, it is Scorsese&#x27;s most recent film that is not an adaptation or biopic.

The film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Feature. Scorsese won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director for the film.

==Plot==
After a boring day at work, computer data entry worker Paul Hackett strikes up conversation with a stranger named Marcy Franklin in a café in New York City. Marcy tells him that she is living in SoHo with a sculptor named Kiki Bridges, who makes and sells plaster-of-Paris paperweights resembling cream cheese bagels, and leaves him her number. After calling her, Paul takes a taxi to her apartment later that night. On the way, his $20 bill is blown out the window of the cab, leaving him with only some change, much to the incredulity of the cab driver. At the apartment, Paul meets Kiki, who is working on a sculpture of a screaming man which he compares to Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot;. Paul rifles through Marcy&#x27;s belongings and discovers several items suggesting that Marcy is disfigured from burns; this, along with her increasingly strange behavior, leads him to abandon the date.

Paul attempts to go home by subway, but the fare has increased at the stroke of midnight, and he can no longer afford it. He goes to a bar where Julie, a waitress, immediately becomes enamored of him. At the bar, Paul learns that there has been a string of burglaries in the neighborhood. Tom, the bartender, offers to give Paul money for a subway token, but he is unable to open the bar&#x27;s cash register. They exchange keys so that Paul can go to Tom&#x27;s apartment to fetch the cash register key.

Paul spots two burglars, Neil and Pepe, with Kiki&#x27;s sculpture. After he confronts them, they flee, dropping the sculpture in the process. When Paul returns the sculpture to Kiki and Marcy&#x27;s apartment, Kiki encourages him to apologize to Marcy. However, when he enters Marcy&#x27;s room, he discovers that she has committed suicide by overdosing on Seconal. Paul reports Marcy&#x27;s death before noticing a roving neighborhood watch on the street below. On the way out, he grabs a note from Kiki inviting him and Marcy to Club Berlin.

The bar is locked when Paul arrives, with a sign stating that Tom will return shortly. Paul runs into Julie on the street, and she invites him up to her apartment to wait for Tom. Paul is unnerved by her strange behavior, including sketching him while they talk. When he leaves the apartment, a scorned Julie makes posters showing her sketch of him as the burglar. He finally returns to the bar, where Tom receives a phone call that his girlfriend (Marcy) has killed herself. Paul leaves to find Kiki and inform her of Marcy&#x27;s suicide. The bouncer at Club Berlin refuses him entry because his hairstyle does not fit the mohawk dress code, and Paul narrowly escapes several punks who attempt to forcibly give him a haircut.

Back outside, Paul meets a Mister Softee ice cream truck driver named Gail, who mistakes him for the burglar based on Julie&#x27;s posters. Gail and a mob of locals, including Tom, relentlessly pursue Paul, who seeks refuge at the club. Sleep-deprived, bedraggled, and ranting, Paul uses his last quarter to play &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot; by Peggy Lee on the club&#x27;s jukebox and asks an older woman named June to dance. After he explains his situation, June offers to hide him in her apartment underneath the club, where she uses papier-mâché to disguise him as a sculpture while the mob raids the club. After the mob leaves, June is worried they will come back, and doesn&#x27;t take off the plaster, which hardens, trapping Paul in a position that resembles Kiki&#x27;s sculpture. 

Neil and Pepe break in and steal Paul, thinking him to be the sculpture they had dropped in the street earlier, and place him in the back of their van. The van speeds uptown and takes a sharp turn which swings open the van&#x27;s back door. Paul falls to the pavement, with the force of the impact breaking the plaster open, directly outside the front gate of his office building. With no way to go home, he simply brushes himself off and goes to his desk, where his computer screen greets him for another day of work.

==Cast==

== Themes and motifs ==
This film belongs in a grouping that revolves around a young working professional who is placed under threat, named the &quot;yuppie nightmare cycle&quot;, a subgenre of films which combines screwball comedy and film noir. Some critics present a psychoanalytic view of the film; Paul is constantly emasculated by women in the film: by Kiki with her sexual aggressiveness and lust for masochism, Marcy turning down his sexual advances, Julie and Gail turning a vigilante mob on him, and June trapping him in plaster. There are many references to castration within the film, most of which are shown when women are present. In the bathroom in Terminal Bar where Julie first encounters Paul, there is an image scrawled on the wall of a shark biting a man&#x27;s erect penis. Marcy makes a reference to her husband using a double entendre when saying, &quot;I broke the whole thing off&quot; when talking about their sex life. One of the mouse traps that surrounds her bed clamps shut when Julie tries to seduce Paul.

Michael Rabiger sees mythological symbolism as a primary theme of the film, stating: &quot;The hero of Scorsese&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;After Hours&quot; is like a rat trying to escape from a labyrinth. Indeed there is a caged rat in one scene where Paul finds himself trapped in a talkative woman&#x27;s apartment. The film could be plotted out as a labyrinthine journey, each compartment holding out the promise of a particular experience, almost all illusory and misleading&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;After Hours&quot; was originally to be directed by Tim Burton after Dunne and Robinson were impressed with his short film &quot;Vincent&quot;, but Burton willingly stepped aside when Scorsese expressed interest.

Paramount Pictures&#x27; abandonment of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; was a huge disappointment to Scorsese, and spurred him to focus on independent companies and smaller projects. Scorsese&#x27;s most recent film, &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;, also failed at the box office. He stated in an interview with Michael Wilson that &quot;Marty, it&#x27;s probably time you earned a bit of money&quot;.

The opportunity to direct &quot;After Hours&quot; was offered to Scorsese by his lawyer Jay Julien, who put him through Griffin Dunne and Amy Robinson&#x27;s Double Play Company. The project was called &quot;One Night in Soho&quot; and it was based on a script by Joseph Minion. The screenplay, originally titled &quot;Lies&quot; after a 1982 Joe Frank monologue that inspired it, was written as part of an assignment for his film course at Columbia University. According to Frank, he was not asked for rights to the story, asking &quot;what must the screenwriter have been thinking to place himself in such jeopardy?&quot; Minion was 26 years old at the time the film was produced. The script finally became &quot;After Hours&quot; after Scorsese made his final amendments.

One of Scorsese&#x27;s contributions involved the dialogue between Paul and the doorman at Club Berlin, which was inspired by Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Before the Law&quot;, one of the short stories included in his novel &quot;The Trial&quot;. As Scorsese explained to Paul Attanasio, the short story reflected his frustration toward the production of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;.

Steven Spielberg suggested that the film end with the statue falling off the truck and breaking into thousands of pieces. Paul is not inside the statue and is instead on the expressway yelling &quot;They&#x27;re coming to get you! The invaders are coming!&quot;. However, Terry Gilliam told him to cut that scene.

&quot;After Hours&quot; was the first fictional film directed by Scorsese since &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; in 1974 not to feature Robert De Niro.

British director Michael Powell took part in the production of the film, and he and editor Thelma Schoonmaker married soon afterward. Nobody was sure how the film should end. Powell said that Paul must finish up back at work, but this was initially dismissed as too unlikely and difficult. They tried many other endings, and a few were even filmed, but the only one that everyone felt really worked was to have Paul finish up back at work just as the new day was starting.

==Music==
The score for &quot;After Hours&quot; was composed by Howard Shore. Although an official soundtrack album was not released, many of Shore&#x27;s cues appear on the 2009 album &quot;Howard Shore: Collector&#x27;s Edition Vol. 1&quot;. In addition to the score, other music credited at the end of the film is:

==Reception==
&quot;After Hours&quot; grossed only $10.1 million in the United States, but was given positive reviews and has since been considered an &quot;underrated&quot; entry in the director&#x27;s filmography. The film won Scorsese the Best Director award at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival and allowed him to take a hiatus from the tumultuous development of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave &quot;After Hours&quot; four out of four stars. He praised the film as one of the year&#x27;s best and said it &quot;continues Scorsese&#x27;s attempt to combine comedy and satire with unrelenting pressure and a sense of all-pervading paranoia.&quot; He later added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Vincent Canby gave the film a mixed review, calling it an &quot;entertaining tease, with individually arresting sequences that are well acted by Mr. Dunne and the others, but which leave you feeling somewhat conned.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Bursting with frantic energy and tinged with black humor, &quot;After Hours&quot; is a masterful – and often overlooked – detour in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s filmography.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on reviews from nine critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
==Home media==
Warner Home Video released &quot;After Hours&quot; on VHS and Betamax in 1986, and both widescreen and pan-and-scan NTSC LaserDiscs. It has also been released on DVD. On July 11, 2023, the film was released on 4K UHD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection.

==Legacy==
&quot;After Hours&quot; served as an inspiration for the 2020 album &quot;After Hours&quot; by Canadian singer the Weeknd. The film also inspired the 2021 &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; episode &quot;Beard After Hours&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Zahir&quot; (original Spanish title: &quot;El Zahir&quot;) is a short story by the Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges. It is one of the stories in the book &quot;The Aleph and Other Stories&quot;, first published in 1949, and revised by the author in 1974. Translated into English by Dudley Fitts, it was published in Partisan Review, February 1950.

==Plot summary==
Zahir is a person or an object that has the power to create an obsession in everyone who sees it, so that the affected person perceives less and less of reality and more and more of the Zahir, at first only while asleep, then at all times.

In the story, a fictionalized version of Borges gets the Zahir in his change after paying for a drink in the form of a 20 cents coin. Borges then tells the reader about a train of thought focused on famous coins throughout history and legend, and the fact that a coin symbolizes our free will, since it can be turned into anything. These feverish thoughts keep him awake for a while. The next day, Borges decides to lose the coin. He goes to a faraway neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, while he carefully avoids looking at the street names and numbers, and manages to get rid of the Zahir by paying for another drink in an anonymous bar.

The writer is unable to forget the coin, which he gradually becomes more obsessed with. He tries to look for a cure, and after some research, he finds a book that explains the history behind the Zahir, and that it manifested previously as a tiger, an astrolabe, the bottom of a well, and a vein in a marble column in an aljama (a certain synagogue or mosque in Córdoba, Spain). According to the myth, everything on earth has the propensity to be a Zahir, but &quot;the Almighty does not allow more than one thing at a time to be it, since one alone can seduce multitudes.&quot;

Borges tells us that soon he will be unable to perceive external reality, and he will have to be dressed and fed; but then he reflects that this fate does not worry him, since he will be oblivious to it. In idealistic philosophy, &quot;to live and to dream are synonymous,&quot; and he will simply pass &quot;from a very complex dream to a very simple dream.&quot; In a mixture of despair and resignation, he wonders:

==Other works of the same title==
The title of &quot;The Zahir&quot; (2005) by Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho refers to Borges&#x27; story. It tells the story of a man who becomes obsessed with his wife, who has disappeared.

==Notes==
*&quot;The Zahir&quot; is in many ways the opposite of &quot;The Aleph&quot;, the subject of another Borges short story also published in the same short story collection. Whereas viewing the Aleph causes the observer to see all things, viewing the Zahir causes the observer eventually to see nothing but it.
*This is one of many Borges stories that manifests the author&#x27;s obsession with tigers. (The story mentions a man afflicted by the Zahir who sees only tigers.)
*Borges touches upon the concept of the Zahir in his short story &quot;Deutsches Requiem&quot;, also published in 1949. In that story, Borges wrote: &quot;I had come to understand many years before that there is nothing on earth that does not contain the seed of a possible Hell; a face, a word, a compass, a cigarette advertisement, are capable of driving a person mad if he is unable to forget them.&quot; Both stories also contain similar passages about a piece of art containing tigers.

<text>The Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum is a U.S.A. 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to the display and preservation of rare military aircraft, tanks and other military equipment. The museum reopened on the Memorial Day Weekend 2023.

On rotation in the three working hangars are military artifacts from the United States, Britain, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan.

The Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum is based at Seattle-Paine Field International Airport in Everett, WA. Mechanics are typically on-site Monday through Friday, working on maintaining the technology and operating condition. The museum provides guided tours three days a week, hosts a variety of activities, features war conflict simulators, and possesses countless historical artifacts.

==History==
In 1998, Microsoft Corporation co-founder Paul Allen began acquiring and preserving vintage aircraft. Allen&#x27;s passion for aviation and history, and his awareness of the increasing rarity of original World War II aircraft, motivated him to restore these artifacts to the highest standard of authenticity and share them with the public.

The Collection opened to the public in 2004 at the Arlington, Washington, airfield, but in 2008 moved to a newly renovated historic industrial hangar located at Paine Field in Everett, Washington, United States. In 2013, the Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum added a 22,000 square foot expansion hangar for its expanding collection. In 2018, came another expansion featuring the opening of Hangar C, which added over two dozen artifacts. On March 24, 2017, the Museum changed its name from the Flying Heritage Collection to the Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum to reflect the transition from exclusively aircraft to a military vehicle &amp; armament as well. In 2018, the Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum became a public 501c(3) nonprofit. On March 3, 2020, the Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum temporarily closed due to complications that arose as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In April 2022, the industry magazine &quot;Air Classics&quot; reported that the museum&#x27;s collection was sold, promising further details in its June issue. The Dutch Aviation Society reported that the buyer was Steuart Walton, grandson of Walmart founder Sam Walton. The sale was confirmed by CNN and other media in August, 2022. The plan is for the museum to remain in Everett; reopening in 2023 under the stewardship of the Wartime History Museum, a nonprofit established by Walton earlier in 2022.

Walmart heir Steuart Walton&#x27;s nonprofit, the Wartime History Museum, acquired aviation artifacts from the FHCAM and reopened the museum on Memorial Day Weekend of 2023. The museum remains open to the public in Everett, WA.

<text>The Telemax is a telecommunications tower built from 1988 to 1992 in Hanover. It was designed by Hans U. Böckler and is high. The tower is the fifth-tallest telecommunications tower in Germany. The owner and operator of the site is a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.

==Description==
Originally a substantially slimmer round tower was planned. However, when the plans were submitted for approval, the inscription &quot;Model Hamburg&quot; was allegedly still written on the plan. It was decided that only a &quot;Model Hanover&quot; was appropriate for the state capital and thus the planning of the telecommunication tower had to begin again.

There is no observation deck on the Telemax. The building is of architectural interest due to its square surfaces. In 1997, Böckler received the reinforced concrete prize The Art of Reinforcement () for the tower&#x27;s truss structure.

The Telemax is in the city&#x27;s district, which is about from the city centre. It can be seen from all over this part of the city, and is an obvious landmark. It can be seen from the highway from about away, from the A 2 near Lehrte, for example. The name of the previous radio tower in the city was changed to after this new tower went into service. The tower is illuminated in magenta, the corporate colour of Deutsche Telekom AG, for special occasions, such as the Hannover Messe or CeBit.

<text>The Georgia World Congress Center (GWCC) is a convention center in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. Enclosing some 3.9 million ft2 (360,000 m2) in exhibition space and hosting more than a million visitors each year, the GWCC is the world&#x27;s largest LEED certified convention center and the fourth-largest convention center in the United States. Opened in 1976, the GWCC was the first state-owned convention center established in the United States. The center is operated on behalf of the state by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which was chartered in 1971 by Georgia General Assembly to develop an international trade and exhibition center in Atlanta. The authority later developed the Georgia Dome, Centennial Olympic Park, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which replaced the Georgia Dome. In 2017, the Georgia Dome was closed on March 5 and demolished by implosion on November 20 while Mercedes-Benz Stadium officially opened on August 26. While the GWCCA owns Mercedes-Benz Stadium, AMB Group, the parent organization for the National Football League&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons and Major League Soccer&#x27;s Atlanta United FC, is responsible for the stadium&#x27;s operations.

In addition to convention and trade shows, the GWCC often coordinated with the Georgia Dome to host activities in conjunction with major events being held at the dome. Every year, the center hosts SEC Football Fanfare, a two-day fan festival for the thousands of Southeastern Conference football fans in the city for the SEC Championship Game. The center played host to a similar event in tandem with WrestleMania XXVII, WrestleMania Axxess. &quot;Family Feud&quot; started taping at Georgia World Congress Center in 2015 and stayed there until 2017, when it moved back to Los Angeles. &quot;Feud&quot; returned to Georgia World Congress Center in August 2020 and remained there until 2021.

The GWCC is located in downtown Atlanta at 285 Andrew Young International Boulevard NW, adjacent to CNN Center and State Farm Arena. Public transportation is serviced by the GWCC/CNN Center MARTA station. Delta Air Lines previously had a ticket office in the lobby of the complex.

Though similarly named, the Georgia International Convention Center is a smaller unrelated facility located near Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

==Layout==

The GWCC is made up of three adjacent buildings, Buildings A, B, and C. In total these buildings have twelve exhibit halls, 105 meeting rooms, and two ballrooms. Building A has three exhibit halls and the Sidney Marcus auditorium seating 1,740. Building B, the largest, contains five exhibit halls and the 33,000 square-foot (3,065 m 2) Thomas B. Murphy Ballroom. The newest building, Building C, has four exhibit halls and the 25,700 square-foot (2,387 m 2) Georgia Ballroom. Other amenities include a FedEx Kinko&#x27;s office, coffee shops, a gift shop, internet access, telephone service, full IT management, a concierge desk, and a food court plus another restaurant. 

Freight rail tracks run through the middle of the complex and under the parking decks. The complex incorporates pedestrian bridges to connect exhibit halls on opposite sides of the tracks.

==History==
===20th century===

Designed by Atlanta-based architects tvsdesign, formerly Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback &amp; Associates – TVS, GWCC opened in 1976 with of exhibit space. Additional phases opened in 1985, 1992, and 2002. During the 1996 Summer Olympics, the GWCC hosted handball, fencing, judo, table tennis, weightlifting, wrestling, and the fencing and shooting portions of the modern pentathlon. The International Broadcast Centre for the worldwide media was also set up inside the GWCC.

===21st century===

On November 8, 2001, President George W. Bush made a speech at the GWCC in which he exhorted the crowd of police, firefighters, and politicians, &quot;My fellow Americans, Let&#x27;s roll!&quot; He was invoking the last words of Todd Beamer, a passenger on United Airlines Flight 93, one of the flights hijacked during the September 11 attacks, was one of the participants in an attempt to storm the cockpit and wrest control of the airplane from the hijackers. Bush used the words again in the 2002 State of the Union address: &quot;For too long our culture has said, &#x27;If it feels good, do it.&#x27; Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: &#x27;Let&#x27;s roll.&#x27;&quot;

On March 14, 2008, a tornado struck Atlanta, including the downtown area. The Georgia World Congress Center was heavily damaged by the storm, including roof and water damage. In addition to rain pouring in from the holes in the roof, there was also water damage from the sprinkler system and broken water pipes. The extent of the damage led to the cancellation of immediate events. After the disaster, a letter was posted on GWCC&#x27;s website detailing the closure of the GWCC. However, the facility along with the nearby Georgia Dome was able to be repaired enough to host the FIRST Robotics World Championship during the dates of April 18–20. The Georgia Dome and the Congress Center were also ready in time for the International Career Development Conference (ICDC) run by DECA, an association of marketing students from around the country. FBLA-PBL, a student business organization, held its opening and closing sessions for the National Leadership Conference in 2008 there. The tornado was the first to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in the 1880s. FBLA-PBL once again held their FBLA National Leadership Conference in the Congress Center in 2016 for Opening and Closing Session, with over 12,000 attendees. DECA once again held their DECA International Career Development Conference (ICDC) in 2018 in the facility, with over 19,000 attendees.

The center hosted the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards, the first held outside of Los Angeles.

On April 12, 2020, state officials announced plans to convert a portion of the GWCC into a temporary 200-bed hospital in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia. The temporary hospital will treat coronavirus patients with mild to moderate symptoms, allowing area hospitals to allocate its resources towards treating critical patients, specifically those requiring ventilators.

==Law enforcement==
The Georgia World Congress Center has its own Department of Public Safety, created by state legislature act HB 1475 in 1995. Although the GWCCA Police Department has statewide jurisdiction, its primary obligation is to protect the Congress Center, Georgia Dome, and Centennial Olympic Park. Joe McKinney is currently chief of the department, which employs 30 sworn officers and 46 unsworn security officers. It has both a police officer division as well as a security officer division, with bike patrol, Segway patrol and vehicle patrol.

<text>The Lanë () is the main stream that crosses through Tirana, the capital of Albania. Its source is in the mountains east of Tirana. Although once clean, it now carries sewage. During the 1990s, many illegal kiosks and buildings were constructed on the banks of the river. They were later demolished and removed in a campaign by Tirana&#x27;s then-mayor Edi Rama in the early 2000s. No fish live there now due to the high pollution of its waters. The Lanë flows into the Tiranë River near Bërxullë.

<doc id="613052" wikidata="Q10860201" url="?curid=613052" title="Direct and indirect realism">
<text>In the philosophy of perception and philosophy of mind, direct or naïve realism, as opposed to indirect or representational realism, are differing models that describe the nature of conscious experiences; out of the metaphysical question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by our conscious experience.

Indirect realism is broadly equivalent to the scientific view of perception that subjects do not experience the external world as it really is, but perceive it through the lens of a conceptual framework. Furthermore, indirect realism is a core tenet of the cognitivism paradigm in psychology and cognitive science. While there is superficial overlap, the indirect model is unlike the standpoint of idealism, which holds that only ideas are real, but there are no mind-independent objects.

Conversely, direct realism postulates that conscious subjects view the world directly, treating concepts as a 1:1 correspondence. Furthermore, the framework rejects the premise that knowledge arrives via a representational medium, as well as the notion that concepts are interpretations of sensory input derived from a real external world.

==History==
Aristotle was the first to provide a description of direct realism. In &quot;On the Soul&quot; he describes how a see-er is informed of the object itself by way of the hylomorphic form carried over the intervening material continuum with which the eye is impressed.

In medieval philosophy, direct realism was defended by Thomas Aquinas.

Indirect realism was popular with several early modern philosophers, including René Descartes, John Locke, G. W. Leibniz, and David Hume.

Locke categorized qualities as follows: 

* Primary qualities are qualities which are &quot;explanatorily basic&quot; – which is to say, they can be referred to as the explanation for other qualities or phenomena without requiring explanation themselves – and they are distinct in that our sensory experience of them resembles them in reality. (For example, one perceives an object as spherical precisely because of the way the atoms of the sphere are arranged.) Primary qualities cannot be removed by either thought or physical action, and include mass, movement, and, controversially, solidity (although later proponents of the distinction between primary and secondary qualities usually discount solidity).
* Secondary qualities are qualities that one&#x27;s experience does not directly resemble; for example, when one sees an object as red, the sensation of seeing redness is not produced by some quality of redness in the object, but by the arrangement of atoms on the surface of the object which reflects and absorbs light in a particular way. Secondary qualities include colour, smell, sound, and taste.

Thomas Reid, a notable member of the Scottish common sense realism was a proponent of direct realism. Direct realist views have been attributed to Baruch Spinoza. 

Late modern philosophers, J. G. Fichte and G. W. F. Hegel followed Kant in adopting empirical realism. Direct realism was also defended by John Cook Wilson in his Oxford lectures (1889–1915). On the other hand, Gottlob Frege (in his 1892 paper &quot;Über Sinn und Bedeutung&quot;) subscribed to indirect realism.

In contemporary philosophy, indirect realism has been defended by Edmund Husserl and Bertrand Russell. Direct realism has been defended by Hilary Putnam, John McDowell, Galen Strawson, and John R. Searle.

However, epistemological dualism has come under sustained attack by other contemporary philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein (the private language argument) and Wilfrid Sellars in his seminal essay &quot;Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind&quot;. Indirect realism is argued to be problematical because of Ryle&#x27;s regress and the homunculus argument. Recently, reliance on the private language argument and the &quot;homunculus objection&quot; has itself come under attack. It can be argued that those who argue for &quot;inner presence&quot;, to use Antti Revonsuo&#x27;s term, are not proposing a private &quot;referent&quot;, with the application of language to it being &quot;private&quot; and thus unshareable, but a &quot;private&quot; use of &quot;public&quot; language. There is no doubt that each of us has a private understanding of public language, a notion that has been experimentally supported; George Steiner refers to our personal use of language as an &quot;idiolect&quot;, one particular to ourselves in its detail. The question has to be put how a collective use of language can go on when, not only do we have differing understandings of the words we use, but our sensory registrations differ.

==Arguments against direct realism==

===Argument from illusion===

This argument was &quot;first offered in a more or less fully explicit form in Berkeley (1713).&quot; It is also referred to as the problem of conflicting appearances (e.g. Myles Burnyeat&#x27;s article &quot;Conflicting Appearances&quot;). It has been argued that &quot;informed commonsense&quot; indicates that perceptions often depend on organs of perception. For example, humans would receive visual information very differently if they, like flies, had compound eyes, and may not even be able to imagine how things would appear with entirely different sense organs such as infra-red detectors or echo-location devices. Furthermore, perception systems can misrepresent objects even when in full working order, as shown, for example, by optical illusions like the Müller-Lyer illusion. More dramatically, sometimes people perceive things which are not there at all, which can be termed instances of &quot;hallucination&quot; or &quot;perceptual delusion&quot;.

The argument from illusion allegedly shows the need to posit sense-data as the immediate objects of perception. In cases of illusion or hallucination, the object has qualities that no public physical object in that situation has and so must be distinct from any such object. Naïve realism may accommodate these facts as they stand by virtue of its very vagueness (or &quot;open-texture&quot;): it is not specific or detailed enough to be refuted by such cases. A more developed direct realist might respond by showing that various cases of misperception, failed perception, and perceptual relativity do not make it necessary to suppose that sense-data exist. When a stick submerged in water looks bent a direct realist is not compelled to say the stick actually is bent but can say that the stick can have more than one appearance: a straight stick can look bent when light reflected from the stick arrives at one&#x27;s eye in a crooked pattern, but this appearance is not necessarily a sense-datum in the mind. Similar things can be said about the coin which appears circular from one vantage point and oval-shaped from another. Pressing on your eyeball with a finger creates double vision but assuming the existence of two sense-data is unnecessary: the direct realist can say that they have two eyes, each giving them a different view of the world. Usually the eyes are focused in the same direction; but sometimes they are not.

However, this response is presumably based on previously observed data. If one were to be able to observe nothing other than the stick in the water, with no previous information, it would appear that the stick was bent. Visual depth in particular is a set of inferences, not an actual experience of the space between things in a radial direction outward from the observation point. If all empirical evidence is based upon observation then the entire developed memory and knowledge of every perception and of each sense may be as skewed as the bent stick. Since objects with different qualities are experienced from each of the different perspectives there is no apparent experiential basis for regarding one out of any such set of related perceptual experiences as the one in which the relevant physical object is itself immediately experienced. The most reasonable conclusion is that the experienced object is always distinct from the physical object or at least that there is no way to identify which, if any, of the immediately experienced objects is the physical object itself. Epistemologically it is as though physical objects were never given, whether or not that is in fact the case.

Another potential counter-example involves vivid hallucinations: phantom elephants, for instance, might be interpreted as sense-data. A direct realist response would differentiate hallucination from genuine perception: no perception of elephants is going on, only the different and related mental process of hallucination. However, if there are visual images when we hallucinate it seems reasonable that there are visual images when we see. Similarly if dreaming involves visual and auditory images in our minds it seems reasonable to think there are visual and auditory images, or sense-data, when we are awake and perceiving things. This argument has been challenged in a number of different ways. First it has been questioned whether there must be some object present that actually has the experienced qualities, which would then seemingly have to be something like a sense-datum. Why couldn&#x27;t it be that the perceiver is simply in a state of seeming to experience such an object without any object actually being present? Second, in cases of illusion and perceptual relativity there is an object present which is simply misperceived, usually in readily explainable ways, and no need to suppose that an additional object is also involved. Third, the last part of the perceptual relativity version of the argument has been challenged by questioning whether there is really no experiential difference between veridical and non-veridical perception; and by arguing that even if sense-data are experienced in non-veridical cases and even if the difference between veridical and non-veridical cases is, as claimed, experientially indiscernible, there is still no reason to think that sense-data are the immediate objects of experience in veridical cases. Fourth, do sense-data exist through time or are they momentary? Can they exist when not being perceived? Are they public or private? Can they be themselves misperceived? Do they exist in minds or are they extra-mental, even if not physical? On the basis of the intractability of these questions, it has been argued that the conclusion of the argument from illusion is unacceptable or even unintelligible, even in the absence of a clear diagnosis of exactly where and how it goes wrong.

Direct realists can potentially deny the existence of any such thing as a mental image but this is difficult to maintain, since we seem able to visually imagine all sorts of things with ease. Even if perception does not involve images other mental processes like imagination certainly seem to. One view, similar to Reid&#x27;s, is that we do have images of various sorts in our minds when we perceive, dream, hallucinate and imagine but when we actually perceive things, our sensations cannot be considered objects of perception or attention. The only objects of perception are external objects. Even if perception is accompanied by images, or sensations, it is wrong to say we perceive sensations. Direct realism defines perception as perception of external objects where an &quot;external object&quot; is allowed to be a photon in the eye but not an impulse in a nerve leading from the eye. Recent work in neuroscience suggests a shared ontology for perception, imagination and dreaming, with similar areas of brain being used for all of these.

The character of experience of a physical object can be altered in major ways by changes in the conditions of perception or of the relevant sense-organs and the resulting neurophysiological processes, without change in the external physical object that initiates this process and that may seem to be depicted by the experience. Conversely any process that yields the same sensory/neural results will yield the same perceptual experience, no matter what the physical object that initiated the process may have been like. Furthermore, the causal process that intervenes between the external object and the perceptual experience takes time, so that the character of the experience reflects, at the most, an earlier stage of that object than the one existing at the moment of perception. As in observations of astronomical objects the external object may have ceased to exist long before the experience occurs. These facts are claimed to point to the conclusion that the direct object of experience is an entity produced at the end of this causal process, distinct from any physical object that initiates the process.&quot;

== Arguments against indirect realism ==

One concern with indirect realism is that if simple data flow and information processing is assumed then something in the brain must be interpreting incoming data. This something is often described as a homunculus, although the term homunculus is also used to imply an entity that creates a continual regress, and this need not be implied. This suggests that some phenomenon other than simple data flow and information processing is involved in perception. This is more of an issue now than it was for rationalist philosophers prior to Newton, such as Descartes, for whom physical processes were poorly defined. Descartes held that there is a &quot;homunculus&quot; in the form of the soul, belonging to a form of natural substance known as &quot;res cogitans&quot; that obeyed different laws from those obeyed by solid matter (&quot;res extensa&quot;). Although Descartes&#x27; duality of natural substances may have echoes in modern physics (Bose and Fermi statistics) no agreed account of &#x27;interpretation&#x27; has been formulated. Thus representationalism remains an incomplete description of perception. Aristotle realized this and simply proposed that ideas themselves (representations) must be aware—in other words that there is no further transfer of sense impressions beyond ideas.
A potential difficulty with representational realism is that, if we only have knowledge of representations of the world, how can we know that they resemble in any significant way the objects to which they are supposed to correspond? Any creature with a representation in its brain would need to interact with the objects that are represented to identify them with the representation. This difficulty would seem reasonably to be covered by the learning by exploration of the world that goes on throughout life. However, there may still be a concern that if the external world is only to be inferred, its &#x27;true likeness&#x27; might be quite different from our idea of it. The representational realist would answer to this that &quot;true likeness&quot; is an intuitive concept that falls in the face of logic, since a likeness must always depend on the way in which something is considered.

A semantic difficulty may arise when considering reference in representationalism. If a person says &quot;I see the Eiffel Tower&quot; at a time when they are indeed looking at the Eiffel Tower, to what does the term &quot;Eiffel Tower&quot; refer? The direct realist might say that in the representational account people do not really see the tower but rather &#x27;see&#x27; the representation. However, this is a distortion of the meaning of the word &quot;see&quot; which the representationalist does not imply. For the representationalist the statement refers to the Eiffel Tower, which implicitly is experienced in the form of a representation. The representationalist does not imply that when a person refers to the Eiffel Tower, they are referring to their sense experience, and when another person refers to the Tower, they are referring to their sense experience.

Furthermore, representative realism claims that we perceive our perceptual intermediaries—we can attend to them—just as we observe our image in a mirror. However, as we can scientifically verify, this is clearly not true of the physiological components of the perceptual process. This also brings up the problem of dualism and its relation to representative realism, concerning the incongruous marriage of the metaphysical and the physical.

The new objection to the Homunculus Argument claims that it relies on a naive view of sensation. Because the eyes respond to light rays, there is no reason for supposing that the visual field requires eyes to see it. Visual sensation (the argument can be extrapolated to the other senses) bears no direct resemblance to the light rays at the retina, nor to the character of what they are reflected from or pass through or what was glowing at the origin of them. The reason given is that they only bear the similarities of &quot;co-variation&quot; with what arrives at the retinas. Just as the currents in a wire going to a loudspeaker vary proportionately with the sounds that emanate from it but have no other likeness, so too does sensation vary proportionately (and not necessarily directly) with what causes it but bears no other resemblance to the input. This implies that the colour we experience is actually a cortical occurrence, and that light rays and external surfaces are not themselves coloured. The proportional variations with which cortical colour changes are there in the external world, but not colour as we experience it. Contrary to what Gilbert Ryle believed, those who argue for sensations being brain processes do not have to hold that there is a &quot;picture&quot; in the brain since this is impossible according to this theory since actual pictures in the external world are not coloured. It is plain that Ryle unthinkingly carried over what the eyes do to the nature of sensation; A. J. Ayer at the time described Ryle&#x27;s position as &quot;very weak&quot;. So there is no &quot;screen&quot; in front of cortical &quot;eyes&quot;, no mental objects before one. As Thomas Hobbes put it: &quot;How do we take notice of sense?—by sense itself&quot;. Moreland Perkins has characterized it thus: that sensing is not like kicking a ball, but rather &quot;kicking a kick&quot;. Today there are still philosophers arguing for colour being a property of external surfaces, light sources, etc.

A more fundamental criticism is implied in theories of this type. The differences at the sensory and perceptual levels between agents require that some means of ensuring at least a partial correlation can be achieved that allows the updatings involved in communication to take place. The process in an informative statement begins with the parties hypothetically assuming that they are referring to the &quot;same&quot; entity or &quot;property&quot;, even though their selections from their sensory fields cannot match; we can call this mutually imagined projection the &quot;logical subject&quot; of the statement. The speaker then produces the logical predicate which effects the proposed updating of the &quot;referent&quot;. If the statement goes through, the hearer will now have a different percept and concept of the &quot;referent&quot;—perhaps even seeing it now as two things and not one. The radical conclusion is that we are premature in conceiving of the external as already sorted into singular &quot;objects&quot; in the first place, since we only need to behave &quot;as if&quot; they are already logically singular. The diagram at the beginning of this entry would thus be thought of as a false picture of the actual case, since to draw &quot;an&quot; object as already selected from the real is only to treat the practically needful, but strictly false, hypothesis of objects-as-logically-singular as ontologically given. The proponents of this view thus argue that there is no need actually &quot;to believe&quot; in the singularity of an object since we can manage perfectly well by &quot;mutually imagining&quot; that &#x27;it&#x27; is singular. A proponent of this theory can thus ask the direct realist why he or she thinks it is necessary to move to taking the imagining of singularity for real when there is no practical difference in the outcome in action. Therefore, although there are selections from our sensory fields which for the time being we treat as if they were objects, they are only provisional, open to corrections at any time, and, hence, far from being direct &quot;representations&quot; of pre-existing singularities, they retain an experimental character. Virtual constructs or no, they remain, however, selections that are causally linked to the real and can surprise us at any time—which removes any danger of solipsism in this theory. This approach dovetails with the philosophy known as social constructivism.

==Adverbial theory==
The above argument invites the conclusion of a perceptual dualism that raises the issue of how and whether the object can be known by experience. The adverbial theory proposes &quot;that this dualism is a dualism of &quot;objects&quot;, with perceptual experience being a more direct experience of objects of a different sort, sense-data.&quot; Perceptual dualism implies:both an &quot;act&quot; of awareness (or apprehension) and an &quot;object&quot; (the sense-datum) which that act apprehends or is an awareness of. The fundamental idea of the adverbial theory, in contrast, is that there is no need for such objects and the problems that they bring with them (such as whether they are physical or mental or somehow neither). Instead, it is suggested, merely the occurrence of a mental act or mental state with its own intrinsic character is enough to account for the character of immediate experience.According to the adverbial theory, when, for example, I experience a silver elliptical shape (as when viewing a coin from an angle) I am in a certain specific state of sensing or sensory awareness or of being appeared to: I sense in a certain manner or am appeared to in a certain way, and that specific manner of sensing or of being appeared to accounts for the content of my experience: I am in a certain distinctive sort of experiential state. There need be no object or entity of any sort that is literally silver and elliptical in the material world or in the mind. I experience a silver and elliptical shape because an object or entity that literally has that color and shape is directly before my mind. But the nature of these entities and the way in which they are related to the mind are difficult to understand. The adverbial theory has the advantage of being metaphysically simpler, avoiding issues about the nature of sense-data, but we gain no real understanding of the nature of the states in question or of how exactly they account for the character of immediate experience.&quot;

<text>The 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état () deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz and marked the end of the Guatemalan Revolution. The coup installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala. The coup was precipitated by a CIA covert operation code-named PBSuccess. 

The Guatemalan Revolution began in 1944, after a popular uprising toppled the military dictatorship of Jorge Ubico. Juan José Arévalo was elected president in Guatemala&#x27;s first democratic election. He introduced a minimum wage and near-universal suffrage. Arévalo was succeeded in 1951 by Árbenz, who instituted land reforms which granted property to landless peasants. The Guatemalan Revolution was disliked by the U.S. federal government, which was predisposed during the Cold War to see it as communist. This perception grew after Árbenz had been elected and formally legalized the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour. The U.S. government feared that Guatemala&#x27;s example could inspire nationalists wanting social reform throughout Latin America. The United Fruit Company (UFC), whose highly profitable business had been affected by the softening of exploitative labor practices in Guatemala, engaged in an influential lobbying campaign to persuade the U.S. to overthrow the Guatemalan government. U.S. President Harry Truman authorized Operation PBFortune to topple Árbenz in 1952, which was a precursor to PBSuccess.

Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected U.S. president in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism, and his staff members John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had significant links to the United Fruit Company. The U.S. federal government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence among Árbenz&#x27;s advisers, and Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSuccess in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. After U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally, Armas&#x27; force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare, as well as air bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade.

The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the fear of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan Army, which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador. Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and strengthened the long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Attempting to justify the coup, the CIA launched Operation PBHistory, which sought evidence of Soviet influence in Guatemala among documents from the Árbenz era, but found none. Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers, banning opposition parties, executing, imprisoning and torturing political opponents, and reversing the social reforms of the revolution. In the first few months of his government, Castillo Armas rounded up and executed between three thousand and five thousand supporters of Árbenz. Nearly four decades of civil war followed, as leftist guerrillas fought the series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities include a genocide of the Maya peoples.

==Historical background==

===Monroe Doctrine===

U.S. President James Monroe&#x27;s foreign policy doctrine of 1823 warned the European powers against further colonization in Latin America. The stated aim of the Monroe Doctrine was to maintain order and stability, and to ensure that U.S. access to resources and markets was not limited. Historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to squabbling children. While the U.S. did not initially have the power to enforce the doctrine, during the 19th century many European powers withdrew from Latin America, allowing the U.S. to expand its sphere of influence. In 1895, President Grover Cleveland laid out a more militant version of the doctrine, stating that the U.S. was &quot;practically sovereign&quot; on the continent.

Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, this aggressive interpretation was used to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean, such as with the 1903 treaty with Cuba that was heavily tilted in the U.S.&#x27; favor. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in Central America. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua (1912–33), and Haiti (1915–34). The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a banana republic. From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala&#x27;s resources and its economy shifted away from Britain and Germany to the U.S., which became Guatemala&#x27;s dominant trade partner. The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and was used to justify the coup in 1954.

===Authoritarian governments and the United Fruit Company===

Following a surge in global coffee demand in the late 19th century, the Guatemalan government made several concessions to plantation owners. It passed legislation that dispossessed the communal landholdings of the Indigenous population and allowed coffee growers to purchase it. Manuel Estrada Cabrera, President of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, was one of several rulers who made large concessions to foreign companies, including the United Fruit Company (UFC). Formed in 1899 by the merger of two large U.S. corporations, the new entity owned large tracts of land across Central America, and in Guatemala controlled the railroads, the docks, and the communication systems. By 1900 it had become the largest exporter of bananas in the world, and had a monopoly over the Guatemalan banana trade. Journalist and writer William Blum describes UFC&#x27;s role in Guatemala as a &quot;state within a state&quot;. The U.S. government was closely involved with the Guatemalan state under Cabrera, frequently dictating financial policies and ensuring that American companies were granted several exclusive rights. When Cabrera was overthrown in 1920, the U.S. sent an armed force to make certain that the new president remained friendly to it.

Fearing a popular revolt following the unrest created by the Great Depression, wealthy Guatemalan landowners lent their support to Jorge Ubico, who won an uncontested election in 1931. Ubico&#x27;s regime became one of the most repressive in the region. He abolished debt peonage, replacing it with a vagrancy law which stipulated that all landless men of working age needed to perform a minimum of 100 days of forced labor annually. He authorized landowners to take any actions they wished against their workers, including executions. Ubico was an admirer of European fascist leaders such as Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, but had to ally with the U.S. for geopolitical reasons, and received substantial support from this country throughout his reign. A staunch anti-communist, Ubico reacted to several peasant rebellions with incarcerations and massacres.

By 1930 the UFC had built an operating capital of 215 million U.S. dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Ubico granted it a new contract, which was immensely favorable to the company. This included of public land, an exemption from taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Ubico requested the UFC cap the daily salary of its workers at 50 U.S. cents, so that workers in other companies would be less able to demand higher wages.

===Guatemalan Revolution and presidency of Arévalo===
The repressive policies of the Ubico government resulted in a popular uprising led by university students and middle-class citizens in 1944. Ubico fled, handing over power to a three-person junta which continued Ubico&#x27;s policies until it was toppled by the October Revolution that aimed to transform Guatemala into a liberal democracy. The largely free election that followed installed a philosophically conservative university professor, Juan José Arévalo, as the President of Guatemala. Arévalo&#x27;s administration drafted a more liberal labor code, built health centers, and increased funding to education. Arévalo enacted a minimum wage, and created state-run farms to employ landless laborers. He cracked down on the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour (&quot;Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo&quot;, PGT) and in 1945 criminalized labor unions in workplaces with fewer than 500 workers. By 1947, the remaining unions had grown strong enough to pressure him into drafting a new labor code, which made workplace discrimination illegal and created health and safety standards. However, Arévalo refused to advocate land reform of any kind, and stopped short of drastically changing labor relations in the countryside.

Despite Arévalo&#x27;s anti-communism, the U.S. was suspicious of him, and worried that he was under Soviet influence. The communist movement did grow stronger during Arévalo&#x27;s presidency, partly because he released its imprisoned leaders, and also through the strength of its teachers&#x27; union. However, the communists were still oppressed by the state, as they were harassed by Arévalo&#x27;s police at any opportunity.Another cause for U.S. worry was Arévalo&#x27;s support of the Caribbean Legion. The Legion was a group of progressive exiles and revolutionaries, whose members included Fidel Castro, that aimed to overthrow U.S.-backed dictatorships across Central America. The government also faced opposition from within the country; Arévalo survived at least 25 coup attempts. A notable example was an attempt in 1949 led by Francisco Arana, which was foiled in an armed shootout between Arana&#x27;s supporters and a force led by Arévalo&#x27;s defense minister Jacobo Árbenz. Arana was among those killed, but details of the coup attempt were never made public. Other sources of opposition to Arévalo&#x27;s government were the right-wing politicians and conservatives within the military who had grown powerful during Ubico&#x27;s dictatorship, as well as the clergy of the Catholic Church.

===Presidency of Árbenz and land reform===

The largely free 1950 elections were won by the popular Árbenz, and represented the first transfer of power between democratically elected leaders in Guatemala. Árbenz had personal ties to some members of the communist PGT, which was legalized during his government, and a couple of members played a role in drafting the new president&#x27;s policies. Nonetheless, Árbenz did not try to turn Guatemala into a communist state, instead choosing a moderate capitalist approach. The PGT too committed itself to working within the existing legal framework to achieve its immediate objectives of emancipating peasants from feudalism and improving workers&#x27; rights. The most prominent component of Árbenz&#x27;s policy was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill himself, having sought advice from economists across Latin America. The focus of the law was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers, who would then be able to begin viable farms of their own.

The official title of the agrarian reform bill was Decree 900. It expropriated all uncultivated land from landholdings that were larger than . If the estates were between and , uncultivated land was to be expropriated only if less than two-thirds of it was in use. The owners were compensated with government bonds, the value of which was equal to that of the land expropriated. The value of the land itself was what the owners had declared it to be in their tax returns in 1952. Of the nearly 350,000 private landholdings, only 1,710 were affected by expropriation. The law was implemented with great speed, which resulted in some arbitrary land seizures. There was violence directed at landowners.

By June 1954, of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had received land by this point. Contrary to the predictions made by detractors, the law resulted in a slight increase in Guatemalan agricultural productivity, cultivated area, and purchases of farm machinery. Overall, the law resulted in a significant improvement in living standards for thousands of peasant families, the majority of whom were Indigenous. Historian Greg Grandin sees the law as representing a fundamental power shift in favor of the hitherto marginalized.

== Genesis and prelude ==
===United Fruit Company lobbying===
By 1950, the United Fruit Company&#x27;s (now Chiquita) annual profits were 65 million U.S. dollars, twice as large as the revenue of the government of Guatemala. The company was the largest landowner in Guatemala, and virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala&#x27;s only port to the Atlantic, allowing it to profit from the flow of goods through the port. Because of its long association with Ubico&#x27;s government, Guatemalan revolutionaries saw the UFC as an impediment to progress after 1944. This image was reinforced by the company&#x27;s discriminatory policies against the native population. Owing to its size, the reforms of Arévalo&#x27;s government affected the UFC more than other companies. Among other things, the new labor code allowed UFC workers to strike when their demands for higher wages and job security were not met. The company saw itself as being targeted by the reforms, and refused to negotiate with strikers, despite frequently being in violation of the new laws. The company&#x27;s troubles were compounded with the passage of Decree 900 in 1952. Of the that the company owned, only 15 percent was being cultivated; the rest was idle, and thus came under the scope of the agrarian reform law.

The UFC responded by intensively lobbying the U.S. government. Several Congressmen criticized the Guatemalan government for not protecting the interests of the company. The Guatemalan government replied that the company was the main obstacle to progress in the country. American historians observed that &quot;[to] the Guatemalans it appeared that their country was being mercilessly exploited by foreign interests which took huge profits without making any contributions to the nation&#x27;s welfare&quot;. In 1953, of uncultivated land was expropriated by the government, which paid 2.99 U.S. dollars per acre (7.39 U.S. dollars per hectare), twice what the company had paid when it bought the property. More expropriation occurred soon after, bringing the total to over , at the rate which UFC had valued its property for tax purposes. The company was unhappy with losing the land, and the level of profit resulting from the sale, resulting in further lobbying in Washington, particularly through U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who had close ties to the company.

The UFC also began a public relations campaign to discredit the Guatemalan government, hiring Edward Bernays, who mounted a concerted misinformation campaign for several years which portrayed the company as the victim of a &quot;communist&quot; Guatemalan government. The company stepped up its efforts after Dwight Eisenhower was elected U.S. president in 1952. These included commissioning a research study from a firm known to be hostile to social reform, which produced a 235-page report that was highly critical of the Guatemalan government. Historians have stated that the report was full of &quot;exaggerations, scurrilous descriptions and bizarre historical theories&quot; but it nonetheless had a significant impact on the members of Congress who read it. Overall, the company spent over half a million dollars to convince lawmakers and the American public that the Guatemalan government needed to be overthrown.

===Operation PBFortune===

As the Cold War developed and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on an increasing number of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo&#x27;s support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try to reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.

The U.S.&#x27;s worries over communist influence increased after the election of Árbenz in 1951 and his enactment of Decree 900 in 1952. In April 1952 Anastasio Somoza García, the dictator of Nicaragua, made his first state visit to the U.S. He made several public speeches praising the U.S., and was awarded a medal by the New York City government. During a meeting with Truman and his senior staff, Somoza said that if the U.S. gave him the arms, he would &quot;clean up Guatemala&quot;. The proposal did not receive much immediate support, but Truman instructed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to follow up on it. The CIA contacted Carlos Castillo Armas, a Guatemalan army officer who had been exiled from the country in 1949 following a failed coup attempt against President Arévalo. Believing that Castillo Armas would lead a coup with or without their assistance, the CIA decided to supply him with weapons and 225,000 U.S. dollars. The CIA considered Castillo Armas sufficiently corrupt and authoritarian to be well suited to lead the coup.

The coup was planned in detail over the next few weeks by the CIA, the UFC, and Somoza. The CIA also contacted Marcos Pérez Jiménez of Venezuela and Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic; the two U.S.-backed dictators were supportive of the plan, and agreed to contribute some funding. Although PBFortune was officially approved on 9 September 1952, various planning steps had been taken earlier in the year. In January 1952, officers in the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Plans compiled a list of &quot;top flight Communists whom the new government would desire to eliminate immediately in the event of a successful anti-Communist coup&quot;. The CIA plan called for the assassination of over 58 Guatemalans, as well as the arrest of many others.

The CIA put the plan into motion in late 1952. A freighter that had been borrowed from the UFC was specially refitted in New Orleans and loaded with weapons under the guise of agricultural machinery, and set sail for Nicaragua. However, the plan was terminated soon after: accounts of its termination vary. Some sources state that the State Department discovered the plan when a senior official was asked to sign a certain document, while others suggest that Somoza was indiscreet. The eventual outcome was that Secretary of State Dean Acheson called off the operation. The CIA continued to support Castillo Armas; it paid him a monthly retainer of 3000 U.S. dollars, and gave him the resources to maintain his rebel force.

===Eisenhower administration===
During his successful campaign for the U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working in an atmosphere of increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFortune had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.

Several figures in Eisenhower&#x27;s administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother CIA Director Allen Dulles, had close ties to the United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had been partners of the law firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while Eisenhower&#x27;s personal assistant Ann C. Whitman was the wife of UFC public relations director Edmund S. Whitman. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower&#x27;s belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.

Historians and authors writing about the 1954 coup have debated the relative importance of the role of the United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.&#x27;s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Some assert that Washington didn&#x27;t believe Guatemala to be an immediate communist threat, citing declassified documents from the U.S. Policy Planning Staff, which state the real risk was the example of independence of the U.S. that Guatemala might offer to nationalists wanting social reform throughout Latin America. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.&#x27;s actions today.

==Operation PBSuccess==

===Planning===
Eisenhower authorized the CIA operation to overthrow Jacobo Árbenz, code-named Operation PBSuccess, in August 1953. The operation was granted a budget of 2.7 million U.S. dollars for &quot;psychological warfare and political action&quot;. The total budget has been estimated at between 5 and 7 million dollars, and the planning employed over 100 CIA agents. In addition, the operation recruited scores of individuals from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of the surrounding countries. The plans included drawing up lists of people within Árbenz&#x27;s government to be assassinated if the coup were to be carried out. Manuals of assassination techniques were compiled, and lists were also made of people whom the junta would dispose of. These were the CIA&#x27;s first known assassination manuals, and were reused in subsequent CIA actions.

The State Department created a team of diplomats who would support PBSuccess. It was led by John Peurifoy, who took over as Ambassador to Guatemala in October 1953. Another member of the team was William D. Pawley, a wealthy businessman and diplomat with extensive knowledge of the aviation industry. Peurifoy was a militant anti-communist, and had proven his willingness to work with the CIA during his time as United States Ambassador to Greece. Under Peurifoy&#x27;s tenure, relations with the Guatemalan government soured further, although those with the Guatemalan military improved. In a report to John Dulles, Peurifoy stated that he was &quot;definitely convinced that if [Árbenz] is not a communist, then he will certainly do until one comes along&quot;. Within the CIA, the operation was headed by Deputy Director of Plans Frank Wisner. The field commander selected by Wisner was former U.S. Army Colonel Albert Haney, then chief of the CIA station in South Korea. Haney reported directly to Wisner, thereby separating PBSuccess from the CIA&#x27;s Latin American division, a decision which created some tension within the agency. Haney decided to establish headquarters in a concealed office complex in Opa-locka, Florida. Codenamed &quot;Lincoln&quot;, it became the nerve center of operation PBSuccess.

The CIA operation was complicated by a premature coup on 29 March 1953, with a futile raid against the army garrison at Salamá, in the central Guatemalan department of Baja Verapaz. The rebellion was swiftly crushed, and a number of participants were arrested. Several CIA agents and allies were imprisoned, weakening the coup effort. Thus the CIA came to rely more heavily on the Guatemalan exile groups and their anti-democratic allies in Guatemala. The CIA considered several candidates to lead the coup. Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, the conservative candidate who had lost the 1950 election to Árbenz, held favor with the Guatemalan opposition but was rejected for his role in the Ubico regime, as well as his European appearance, which was unlikely to appeal to the majority mixed-race &quot;mestizo&quot; population. Another popular candidate was the coffee planter Juan Córdova Cerna, who had briefly served in Arévalo&#x27;s cabinet before becoming the legal adviser to the UFC. The death of his son in an anti-government uprising in 1950 turned him against the government, and he had planned the unsuccessful Salamá coup in 1953 before fleeing to join Castillo Armas in exile. Although his status as a civilian gave him an advantage over Castillo Armas, he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1954, taking him out of the reckoning. Thus it was Castillo Armas, in exile since the failed 1949 coup and on the CIA&#x27;s payroll since the aborted PBFortune in 1951, who was to lead the coming coup.

Castillo Armas was given enough money to recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA established training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons as well as several bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. The CIA trained at least 1,725 foreign guerillas plus thousands of additional militants as reserves. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.

===Caracas conference and U.S. propaganda===
While preparations for Operation PBSuccess were underway, Washington issued a series of statements denouncing the Guatemalan government, alleging that it had been infiltrated by communists. The State Department also asked the Organization of American States to modify the agenda of the Inter-American Conference, which was scheduled to be held in Caracas in March 1954, requesting the addition of an item titled &quot;Intervention of International Communism in the American Republics&quot;, which was widely seen as a move targeting Guatemala. On 29 and 30 January 1954, the Guatemalan government published documents containing information leaked to it by a member of Castillo Armas&#x27; team who had turned against him. Lacking in original documents, the government had engaged in poor forgery to enhance the information it possessed, undermining the credibility of its charges. A spate of arrests followed of allies of Castillo Armas within Guatemala, and the government issued statements implicating a &quot;Government of the North&quot; in a plot to overthrow Árbenz. Washington denied these allegations, and the U.S. media uniformly took the side of their government; even publications which had until then provided relatively balanced coverage of Guatemala, such as &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, suggested that Árbenz had succumbed to communist propaganda. Several Congressmen also pointed to the allegations from the Guatemalan government as proof that it had become communist.

At the conference in Caracas, the various Latin American governments sought economic aid from the U.S., as well as its continuing non-intervention in their internal affairs. The U.S. government&#x27;s aim was to pass a resolution condemning the supposed spread of communism in the Western Hemisphere. The Guatemalan foreign minister Guillermo Toriello argued strongly against the resolution, stating that it represented the &quot;internationalization of McCarthyism&quot;. Despite support among the delegates for Toriello&#x27;s views, the anti-communist resolution passed with only Guatemala voting against, because of the votes of dictatorships dependent on the U.S. and the threat of economic pressure applied by John Dulles. Although support among the delegates for Dulles&#x27; strident anti-communism was less strong than he and Eisenhower had hoped for, the conference marked a victory for the U.S., which was able to make concrete Latin American views on communism.

The U.S. had stopped selling arms to Guatemala in 1951 while signing bilateral defense agreements and increasing arms shipments to neighboring Honduras and Nicaragua. The U.S. promised the Guatemalan military that it too could obtain arms—if Árbenz were deposed. In 1953, the State Department aggravated the U.S. arms embargo by thwarting the Árbenz government&#x27;s arms purchases from Canada, Germany, and Rhodesia. By 1954 Árbenz had become desperate for weapons, and decided to acquire them secretly from Czechoslovakia, which would have been the first time that a Soviet bloc country shipped weapons to the Americas, an action seen as establishing a communist beachhead in the Americas. The weapons were delivered to Guatemala at the Atlantic port of Puerto Barrios by the Swedish freight ship , which sailed from Szczecin in Poland. The U.S. failed to intercept the shipment despite imposing an illegal naval quarantine on Guatemala. However &quot;Guatemalan army officers&quot; quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;some of the arms ... were duds, worn out, or entirely wrong for use there&quot;. The CIA portrayed the shipment of these weapons as Soviet interference in the United States&#x27; backyard; it was the final spur for the CIA to launch its coup.

U.S. rhetoric abroad also had an effect on the Guatemalan military. The military had always been anti-communist, and Ambassador Peurifoy had applied pressure on senior officers since his arrival in Guatemala in October 1953. Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the &quot;Alfhem&quot; to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty, but the U.S. informed army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.

===Psychological warfare===
Castillo Armas&#x27; army of 480 men was not large enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSuccess called for a campaign of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas&#x27; victory as a &quot;fait accompli&quot; to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing tens of thousands of leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events. As part of the psychological warfare, the U.S. Psychological Strategy Board authorized a &quot;Nerve War Against Individuals&quot; to instill fear and paranoia in potential loyalists and other potential opponents of the coup. This campaign included death threats against political leaders deemed loyal or deemed to be communist, and the sending of small wooden coffins, non-functioning bombs, and hangman&#x27;s nooses to such people. The US bombing was also intended to have psychological consequences with E. Howard Hunt of the CIA saying &quot;What we wanted to do was to have a terror campaign, to terrify Arbenz particularly, to terrify his troops, much as the German Stuka bombers terrified the population of Holland, Belgium and Poland&quot;.

&quot;Alfhem&quot;″s success in evading the quarantine led to Washington escalating its intimidation of Guatemala through its navy. On 24 May, the U.S. launched Operation Hardrock Baker, a naval blockade of Guatemala. Ships and submarines patrolled the Guatemalan coasts, and all approaching ships were stopped and searched; these included ships from Britain and France, violating international law. However Britain and France did not protest very strongly, hoping that in return the U.S. would not interfere with their efforts to subdue rebellious colonies in the Middle East. The intimidation was not solely naval; on 26 May one of Castillo Armas&#x27; planes flew over the capital, dropping leaflets that exhorted people to struggle against communism and support Castillo Armas.

The most wide-reaching psychological weapon was the radio station Voice of Liberation, &quot;La Voz de la Liberación&quot;. E. Howard Hunt&#x27;s deputy, David Atlee Phillips, directed the radio station. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. This belief extended outside of Guatemala itself, with foreign correspondents from publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; believing it to be the most authentic source of information. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in Miami by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter. The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to transmitting two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their transmitting power, allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts have been given a lot of credit by historians for the success of the coup, owing to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped transmitting for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted. The Voice of Liberation transmissions continued throughout the conflict, broadcasting exaggerated news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributing to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population.

===Castillo Armas&#x27; invasion===
Castillo Armas&#x27; force of 480 men had been split into four teams, ranging in size from 60 to 198. On 15 June 1954 these four forces left their bases in Honduras and El Salvador, and assembled in various towns just outside the Guatemalan border. The largest force was supposed to attack the Atlantic harbor town of Puerto Barrios, while the others attacked the smaller towns of Esquipulas, Jutiapa, and Zacapa, the Guatemalan army&#x27;s largest frontier post. Zapaca was of great significance to controlling Guatemala as it handled the majority of commerce along key rail routes. The invasion plan quickly faced difficulties; the 60-man force was intercepted and jailed by Salvadoran policemen before it got to the border. At 8:20 am on 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas led his invading troops over the border. Ten trained saboteurs preceded the invasion, with the aim of blowing up railways and cutting telegraph lines. At about the same time, Castillo Armas&#x27; planes flew over a pro-government rally in the capital. The U.S. Psychological Strategy Board ordered the bombing of the Matamoros Fortress in downtown Guatemala City, and a U.S. P-47 warplane flown by a mercenary pilot bombed the city of Chiquimula. Castillo Armas demanded Árbenz&#x27;s immediate surrender. The invasion provoked a brief panic in the capital, which quickly decreased as the rebels failed to make any striking moves. Bogged down by supplies and a lack of transportation, Castillo Armas&#x27; forces took several days to reach their targets, although their planes blew up a bridge on 19 June.

When the rebels did reach their targets, they met with further setbacks. The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten by a garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 men escaping death or capture. The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, with many of the rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebel planes tried air attacks on the capital. These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was. The rebel bombers needed to fly out of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua; as a result, they had a limited payload. A large number of them substituted dynamite or Molotov cocktails for bombs, in an effort to create loud bangs with a lower payload. The planes targeted ammunition depots, parade grounds, and other visible targets. On 22 June, another plane bombed the Honduran town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been conducted by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. 

However, by 22 June 1954, Armas&#x27; forces were down to one P-47 which made an ineffective air strike on the capital. The CIA sponsors of Armas began to worry Operation PBSuccess may fail. Col. Al Haney, heading the CIA&#x27;s operation, informed Allen Dulles that more aircraft was needed or else the Armas invasion would surely fail. Dulles made arrangements for the sale of three additional P-47s from the military to the Nicaraguan government, to be paid for by William Pawley, a successful businessman, Eisenhower supporter, and CIA consultant.  In an Oval Office meeting, Dulles and others briefed President Eisenhower on the need for additional aircraft in the Armas invasion. Upon Eisenhower&#x27;s approval, the planes were purchased by Pawley on behalf of the Nicaraguan government. The P-47s flew from Puerto Rico to Panama and went into action on 23 June, hitting Guatemalan army forces and other targets in the capital. Early in the morning on 27 June 1954, a plane attacked Puerto San José and bombed the British cargo ship, , which was on charter to the U.S. company W.R. Grace and Company Line, and was being loaded with Guatemalan cotton and coffee. This incident cost the CIA one million U.S. dollars in compensation.

===Guatemalan response===
The Árbenz government originally meant to repel the invasion by arming the military-age populace, workers&#x27; militias, and the Guatemalan Army. Resistance from the armed forces, as well as public knowledge of the secret arms purchase, compelled the President to supply arms only to the Army. From the beginning of the invasion, Árbenz was confident that Castillo Armas could be defeated militarily and expressed this confidence in public. But he was worried that a defeat for Castillo Armas would provoke a direct invasion by the U.S. military. This also contributed to his decision not to arm civilians initially; lacking a military reason to do so, this could have cost him the support of the army. Carlos Enrique Díaz, the chief of the Guatemalan armed forces, told Árbenz that arming civilians would be unpopular with his soldiers, and that &quot;the army [would] do its duty&quot;.

Árbenz instead told Díaz to select officers to lead a counter-attack. Díaz chose a corps of officers who were all regarded to be men of personal integrity, and who were loyal to Árbenz. On the night of 19 June, most of the Guatemalan troops in the capital region left for Zacapa, joined by smaller detachments from other garrisons. Árbenz stated that &quot;the invasion was a farce&quot;, but worried that if it was defeated on the Honduran border, Honduras would use it as an excuse to declare war on Guatemala, which would lead to a U.S. invasion. Because of the rumours spread by the Voice of Liberation, there were worries throughout the countryside that a fifth column attack was imminent; large numbers of peasants went to the government and asked for weapons to defend their country. They were repeatedly told that the army was &quot;successfully defending our country&quot;. Nonetheless, peasant volunteers assisted the government war effort, manning roadblocks and donating supplies to the army. Weapons shipments dropped by rebel planes were intercepted and turned over to the government.

The Árbenz government also pursued diplomatic means to try to end the invasion. It sought support from El Salvador and Mexico; Mexico declined to get involved, and the Salvadoran government merely reported the Guatemalan effort to Peurifoy. Árbenz&#x27;s largest diplomatic initiative was in taking the issue to the United Nations Security Council. On 18 June the Guatemalan foreign minister petitioned the council to &quot;take measures necessary ... to put a stop to the aggression&quot;, which he said Nicaragua and Honduras were responsible for, along with &quot;certain foreign monopolies which have been affected by the progressive policy of my government&quot;. The Security Council looked at Guatemala&#x27;s complaint at an emergency session on 20 June. The debate was lengthy and heated, with Nicaragua and Honduras denying any wrongdoing, and the U.S. stating that Eisenhower&#x27;s role as a general in World War II demonstrated that he was against imperialism. The Soviet Union was the only country to support Guatemala. When the U.S. and its allies proposed referring the matter to the Organization of American States, the Soviet Union vetoed the proposal. Guatemala continued to press for a Security Council investigation; the proposal received the support of Britain and France, but on 24 June it was vetoed by the U.S., the first time it did so against its allies. The U.S. accompanied this with threats to the foreign offices of both countries that the U.S. would stop supporting their other initiatives. UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld called the U.S. position &quot;the most serious blow so far aimed at the [United Nations]&quot;. A fact-finding mission was set up by the Inter-American Peace Committee; Washington used its influence to delay the entry of the committee until the coup was complete and a military dictatorship installed.

===Árbenz&#x27;s resignation===
Árbenz was initially confident that his army would quickly dispatch the rebel force. The victory of a small garrison of 30 soldiers over the 180 strong rebel force outside Zacapa strengthened his belief. By 21 June, Guatemalan soldiers had gathered at Zacapa under the command of Colonel Víctor M. León, who was believed to be loyal to Árbenz. León told Árbenz that the counter-attack would be delayed for logistical reasons, but assured him not to worry, as Castillo Armas would be defeated very soon. Other members of the government were not so certain. Army Chief of Staff Parinello inspected the troops at Zacapa on 23 June, and returned to the capital believing that the army would not fight. Afraid of a U.S. intervention in Castillo Armas&#x27; favor, he did not tell Árbenz of his suspicions. PGT leaders also began to have their suspicions; acting secretary general Alvarado Monzón sent a member of the central committee to Zacapa to investigate. He returned on 25 June, reporting that the army was highly demoralized, and would not fight. Monzón reported this to Árbenz, who quickly sent another investigator. He too returned the same report, carrying an additional message for Árbenz from the officers at Zacapa—asking the President to resign. The officers believed that given U.S. support for the rebels, defeat was inevitable, and Árbenz was to blame for it. He stated that if Árbenz did not resign, the army was likely to strike a deal with Castillo Armas, and march on the capital with him.

During this period, Castillo Armas had begun to intensify his aerial attacks with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited material success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant psychological impact. On 25 June, the same day that he received the army&#x27;s ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating the Guatemalan garrison at Chiquimula. Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated that if it were not for U.S. support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the U.S. would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win.

On the night of 25 June, Árbenz called a meeting of the senior leaders of the government, the political parties, and the labor unions. Colonel Díaz was also present. The President told them that the army at Zacapa had abandoned the government, and that the civilian population needed to be armed to defend the country. Díaz raised no objections, and the unions pledged several thousand troops. When the troops were mustered the next day, only a few hundred showed up. The civilian population of the capital had fought alongside the Guatemalan Revolution twice before—during the popular uprising of 1944, and during the attempted coup of 1949—but on this occasion the army, intimidated by the U.S., refused to fight. The union members were reluctant to fight both the invasion and their own military. Seeing this, Díaz reneged on his support of the President, and began plotting to overthrow Árbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for Árbenz&#x27;s resignation. Peurifoy promised to arrange a truce, and the plotters went to Árbenz and informed him of their decision. Árbenz, utterly exhausted and seeking to preserve at least a measure of the democratic reforms that he had brought, agreed without demur. After informing his cabinet of his decision, he left the presidential palace at 8 pm on 27 June 1954, having taped a resignation speech that was broadcast an hour later. In it, he stated that he was resigning to eliminate the &quot;pretext for the invasion&quot;, and that he wished to preserve the gains of the October Revolution of 1944. He walked to the nearby Mexican Embassy, seeking political asylum. Two months later he was granted safe passage out of the country, and flew to exile in Mexico.

Some 120 Árbenz loyalists or communists were also allowed to leave, and the CIA stated that none of the assassination plans contemplated by the CIA were actually implemented. On June 30, 1954 the CIA began a comprehensive destruction process of documents related to Operation PBSuccess. When an oversight committee of the United States Senate in 1975 investigated the history of the CIA&#x27;s assassinations program and requested information about the CIA&#x27;s assassination program as part of Operation PBSuccess, the CIA stated it had lost all such records. Journalist Annie Jacobsen states that the CIA claim of no assassinations having taken place is doubtful. In May 1997, the CIA stated it had rediscovered some of its documents that it had said were lost. The names of assassination targets had all been redacted, which made it impossible to verify whether any of the people on the CIA assassination list were actually killed as part of the operation.

===Military governments===
Immediately after the President announced his resignation, Díaz announced on the radio that he was taking over the presidency, and that the army would continue to fight against the invasion of Castillo Armas. He headed a military junta which also consisted of Colonels Elfego Hernán Monzón Aguirre and Jose Angel Sánchez. Two days later Ambassador Peurifoy told Díaz that he had to resign because, in the words of a CIA officer who spoke to Díaz, he was &quot;not convenient for American foreign policy&quot;. Peurifoy castigated Díaz for allowing Árbenz to criticize the United States in his resignation speech; meanwhile, a U.S.-trained pilot dropped a bomb on the army&#x27;s main powder magazine to intimidate the colonel. Soon after, Díaz was overthrown by a rapid bloodless coup led by Colonel Monzón, who was more pliable to U.S. interests. Díaz later stated that Peurifoy had presented him with a list of names of communists, and demanded that all of them be shot by the next day; Díaz had refused, turning Peurifoy further against him. On 17 June, the army leaders at Zacapa had begun to negotiate with Castillo Armas. They signed a pact, the &quot;Pacto de Las Tunas&quot;, three days later, which placed the army at Zacapa under Castillo Armas, in return for a general amnesty. The army returned to its barracks a few days later, &quot;despondent, with a terrible sense of defeat&quot;.

Although Monzón was staunchly anti-communist and repeatedly spoke of his loyalty to the U.S., he was unwilling to hand over power to Castillo Armas. The fall of Díaz led Peurifoy to believe that the CIA should let the State Department play the lead role in negotiating with the new government. The State Department asked Óscar Osorio, the dictator of El Salvador, to invite all players for talks in San Salvador. Osorio agreed, and Monzón and Castillo Armas arrived in the Salvadoran capital on 30 June. Peurifoy initially remained in Guatemala City, to avoid the appearance of a heavy U.S. role but was forced to travel to San Salvador when the negotiations came close to breaking down on the first day. In the words of John Dulles, Peurifoy&#x27;s role was to &quot;crack some heads together&quot;. Neither Monzón nor Castillo Armas could have remained in power without U.S. support, so Peurifoy was able to force an agreement, which was announced at 4:45 am on 2 July. Castillo Armas and his subordinate Major Enrique Trinidad Oliva joined the three-person junta headed by Monzón, who remained president. On 7 July Colonels Dubois and Cruz Salazar, Monzón&#x27;s supporters on the junta, resigned, according to the secret agreement they had made without Monzón&#x27;s knowledge. Outnumbered, Monzón also resigned, allowing Castillo Armas to be unanimously elected president of the junta. The two colonels were paid 100,000 U.S. dollars apiece for their cooperation. The U.S. promptly recognized the new government on 13 July. Soon after taking office, Castillo Armas faced a coup from young army cadets, who were unhappy with the army&#x27;s surrender. The coup was crushed, leaving 29 dead and 91 wounded. Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred. Castillo Armas was the only candidate; he won the election with 99% of the vote.

===Reactions===
The Guatemalan &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; was reviled internationally. &quot;Le Monde&quot; of Paris and &quot;The Times&quot; of London attacked the coup as &quot;economic colonialism&quot;. In Latin America, public and official opinion was sharply critical of the U.S., and for many Guatemala became a symbol of armed resistance to U.S. hegemony. Former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee called it &quot;a plain act of aggression&quot;. When Allen Dulles described the coup as a victory of &quot;democracy&quot; over communism and claimed that the situation in Guatemala was &quot;being cured by the Guatemalans themselves&quot;, a British official remarked that &quot;it might almost be Molotov speaking about ... Czechoslovakia or Hitler speaking about Austria&quot;. UN Secretary General Hammarskjöld said that the paramilitary invasion was a geopolitical action that violated the human rights stipulations of the United Nations Charter. Even the usually pro-U.S. newspapers of West Germany condemned the coup. Kate Doyle, the Director of the Mexico Project of the National Security Archives, described the coup as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala.

The coup had broad support among U.S. politicians. Historian Piero Gleijeses writes that the foreign policy of both Republican and Democratic parties expressed an intransigent assertion of U.S. hegemony over Central America, making them predisposed to seeing communist threats where none existed. Thus Eisenhower&#x27;s continuation of the Monroe Doctrine had bipartisan support. The coup met with strong negative reactions in Latin America; a wave of anti-United States protests followed. These sentiments persisted for several decades; historians have pointed to the coup as a reason for the hostile reception given to U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon when he visited Latin America four years later. A State Department study found that negative public reactions to the coup had occurred in eleven Latin American countries, including a few that were otherwise pro-American. Historian John Lewis Gaddis states that knowledge of the CIA&#x27;s role in coups in Iran and Guatemala gave the agency &quot;an almost mythic reputation throughout Latin America and the Middle East as an instrument with which the United States could depose governments it disliked, whenever it wished to do so&quot;.

==Aftermath==
===Operation PBHistory===

Operation PBHistory was an effort by the CIA to analyze documents from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been under the influence of the Soviet Union. Because of the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz&#x27;s supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little real information. A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz&#x27;s personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.

Although the initial search failed to find any links to the Soviet Union, the CIA decided to extend the operation, and on 4 August a much larger team was deployed, with members from many government departments, including the State Department and the USIA. The task force was given the cover name Social Research Group. To avoid confrontation with Guatemalan nationalists, the CIA opted to leave the documents in Guatemalan possession, instead funding the creation of a Guatemalan intelligence agency that would try to dismantle the communist organizations. Thus the National Committee of Defense Against Communism (&quot;Comité de Defensa Nacional Contra el Comunismo&quot;) was created on 20 July, and granted a great deal of power over military and police functions. The personnel of the new agency were also put to work analyzing the same documents. The document-processing phase of the operation was terminated on 28 September 1954, having examined 500,000 documents. There was tension between the different U.S. government agencies about using the information; the CIA wished to use it to subvert communists, the USIA for propaganda. The CIA&#x27;s leadership of the operation allowed it to retain control over any documents deemed necessary for clandestine operations.

In the subsequent decade, the documents gathered were used by the authors of several books, most frequently with covert CIA assistance, which described the Guatemalan Revolution and the 1954 coup in terms favorable to the CIA. Despite the efforts of the CIA, both international and academic reaction to U.S. policy remained highly negative. Even books partially funded by the CIA were somewhat critical of its role. PBHistory failed in its chief objective of finding convincing evidence that the PGT had been instruments of the Soviet Union, or even that it had any connection to Moscow whatsoever. The Soviet description of the coup, that the U.S. had crushed a democratic revolution to protect the United Fruit Company&#x27;s control over the Guatemalan economy, became much more widely accepted. Historian Mark Hove stated that &quot;Operation PBHistory proved ineffective because of &#x27;a new, smoldering resentment&#x27; that had emerged in Latin America over US intervention in Guatemala.&quot;

===Political legacy===

The 1954 coup had significant political fallout both inside and outside Guatemala. The relatively easy overthrow of Árbenz, coming soon after the similar overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister in 1953, made the CIA overconfident in its abilities, which led to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow the Cuban government in 1961. Throughout the years of the Guatemalan Revolution, both United States policy makers and the U.S. media had tended to believe the theory of a communist threat. When Árbenz had announced that he had evidence of U.S. complicity in the Salamá incident, it had been dismissed, and virtually the entire U.S. press portrayed Castillo Armas&#x27; invasion as a dramatic victory against communism. The press in Latin America were less restrained in their criticism of the U.S., and the coup resulted in lasting anti-United States sentiment in the region. Outside of the Western Hemisphere, the Soviet Union were pushing to force the Guatemalan issue into the discussion of the UN security council. Allies of the United States, such as the United Kingdom, came very close to joining the Soviet Union&#x27;s side in this argument, backing out at the last minute.

Among the civilians in Guatemala City during the coup was a 25-year-old Che Guevara. After a couple of abortive attempts to fight on the side of the government, Guevara took shelter at the embassy of Argentina, before eventually being granted safe passage to Mexico, where he would join the Cuban Revolution. His experience of the Guatemalan coup was a large factor in convincing him &quot;of the necessity for armed struggle ... against imperialism&quot;, and would inform his successful military strategy during the Cuban Revolution. Árbenz&#x27;s experience during the Guatemalan coup also helped Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuban regime in thwarting the CIA invasion.

Within Guatemala, Castillo Armas worried that he lacked popular support, and thus tried to eliminate all opposition. He promptly arrested several thousand opposition leaders, branding them communists, repealed the constitution of 1945, and granted himself virtually unbridled power. Concentration camps were built to hold the prisoners when the jails overflowed. Acting on the advice of Allen Dulles, Castillo Armas detained a number of citizens trying to flee the country. He also created the National Committee of Defense Against Communism, with sweeping powers of arrest, detention, and deportation. Over the next few years, the committee investigated nearly 70,000 people. An insurgency in opposition to the junta soon developed. The government responded with a campaign of harsh suppression. Thousands were imprisoned arbitrarily, with few ever facing trial. Many were executed; &quot;disappeared&quot;; tortured; or maimed. At Finca Jocatán, in the vicinity of Tiquisate, where the first private sector union in the country had been founded at the start of the revolution in 1944, an estimated 1000 United Fruit workers were executed in the immediate aftermath of the coup. Castillo Armas outlawed all labor unions, peasant organizations, and political parties, except for his own, the National Liberation Movement (&quot;Movimiento de Liberación Nacional&quot;, MLN), which was the ruling party until 1957, and remained influential for decades after.

Castillo Armas&#x27; dependence on the officer corps and the mercenaries who had put him in power led to widespread corruption, and the Eisenhower administration was soon subsidizing the Guatemalan government with many millions of U.S. dollars. Castillo Armas also reversed the agrarian reforms of Árbenz, leading the U.S. embassy to comment that it was a &quot;long step backwards&quot; from the previous policy. Castillo Armas was assassinated in 1957. The UFC did not profit from the coup; although it regained most of its privileges, its profits continued to decline, and it was eventually merged with another company to save itself from bankruptcy. Despite the influence which some of the local Catholic Church leaders had in the coup, anti-Catholic restrictions which had been enforced under previous governments in Guatemala resumed by the 1960s, as many anti-communist governments felt the Church had too much sympathy towards socialist parties.

===Civil War===

The rolling-back of progressive policies resulted in a series of leftist insurgencies in the countryside, beginning in 1960. This triggered the 36-year Guatemalan Civil War between the U.S.-backed military government and the leftist insurgents, who frequently had significant popular support. The largest of these movements was led by the Guerrilla Army of the Poor, which at its largest point had 270,000 members. During the civil war, atrocities against civilians were committed by both sides; 93% of these violations were committed by the U.S.-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s. The violence was particularly severe during the presidencies of Ríos Montt and Lucas García.

Other human rights violations committed included massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. Gleijeses wrote that Guatemala was &quot;ruled by a culture of fear&quot;, and that it held the &quot;macabre record for human rights violations in Latin America&quot;. These violations were partially the result of a particularly brutal counter-insurgency strategy adopted by the government. The ideological narrative that the 1954 coup had represented a battle against communism was often used to justify the violence in the 1980s. Historians have attributed the violence of the civil war to the 1954 coup and the &quot;anti-communist paranoia&quot; that it generated. The civil war ended in 1996, with a peace accord between the guerrillas and the government, which included an amnesty for fighters on both sides. The civil war killed an estimated 200,000 civilians.

===Apologies===
U.S. President Bill Clinton apologized to Guatemala in 1999 for the atrocities committed by the U.S.-backed dictatorships. The apology came soon after the release of a truth commission report that documented U.S. support for the military forces that committed genocide.

In 2011, the Guatemalan government signed an agreement with Árbenz&#x27;s surviving family to restore his legacy and publicly apologize for the government&#x27;s role in ousting him. This included a financial settlement to the family. The formal apology was made at the National Palace by Guatemalan President Álvaro Colom on 20 October 2011, to Jacobo Árbenz Villanova, the son of the former president. Colom stated, &quot;It was a crime to Guatemalan society and it was an act of aggression to a government starting its democratic spring.&quot; The agreement established several forms of reparation for Árbenz&#x27;s family.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Latvia on 3 October 1998. The People&#x27;s Party emerged as the largest party in the Saeima, winning 24 of the 100 seats.

==Results==
==Aftermath==
Initially, a coalition government was formed between Latvian Way, For Fatherland and Freedom, the Social Democratic Alliance and the New Party. This enjoyed a parliamentary majority with 60 out of the 100 MPs. However, within six months of the coalition forming, the Social Democratic Alliance left the government, leaving it with just 46 MPs, wiping out its parliamentary majority. As a result, a new government was formed with the addition of the People&#x27;s Party. This enjoyed a large parliamentary majority, with 70 out of the 100 MPs.

<text>CBOT-DT (channel 4) is a CBC Television station in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, serving the National Capital Region. It is part of a twinstick with Ici Radio-Canada Télé station CBOFT-DT (channel 9). The two stations share studios at the CBC Ottawa Production Centre on Queen Street (across from the Confederation Line light rail station) in Downtown Ottawa, alongside the main corporate offices of the CBC; CBOT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located on the Ryan Tower at Camp Fortune in Chelsea, Quebec, north of Gatineau.

==History==
CBOT went on the air for the first time on June 2, 1953 (broadcasting the coronation of the Queen of Canada, Elizabeth II), becoming the third television station in Canada. Before the launch of Télévision de Radio-Canada station CBOFT, CBOT aired both English and French-language programs.

During the late 1970s into the early 1980s, CBOT was known as &quot;CBC 4 Ottawa&quot;, and its newscasts were known as &quot;CBC 4 News&quot;. In 1980, CBOT&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast was anchored by Ab Douglas, and by Joe Spence at 11:27, following &quot;The National&quot;. During the mid-1980s, the station was known as &quot;CBOT 4&quot;, now &quot;CBC Ottawa&quot;.

==News operation==

CBOT-DT presently broadcasts 10 hours, 40 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with two hours each weekday, a half-hour on Saturdays and ten minutes on Sundays). CBOT airs local news programming in the form of a 90-minute newscast from 5 to 6:30 p.m. and a half-hour newscast at 11 p.m. on weekdays. On weekends, the station airs a half-hour 6 p.m. newscast on Saturdays and a ten-minute summary airs on Sundays at 11 p.m.

===Notable former on–air staff===
* Ian Black (CMOS-endorsed weathercaster) – meteorologist
* Rita Celli – former &quot;CBC News: Ottawa at Six&quot; anchor
* Lloyd Robertson (later anchor of &quot;CBC News: The National&quot; and the &quot;CTV National News&quot;)

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on UHF channel 25, using virtual channel 4.

===Transmitters===
CBOT operated six analog television rebroadcasters in Eastern Ontario and included communities such as Pembroke. Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analog transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC&#x27;s or Radio-Canada&#x27;s television rebroadcasters were converted to digital.

Wilkins is the leader in most years with the Hawks, 12 seasons, the most games played in Hawks franchise history, with 882, the most minutes played with 32,545, the most career points with 23,292, and the most points per game, with 26.4 points per game.

Wilkins led the NBA in scoring in the 1985–86 season. In 2006, Wilkins was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

In addition to his 11 seasons with the Hawks, Wilkins had short stints with the Los Angeles Clippers, the Boston Celtics, Panathinaikos of the Greek Basket League, with whom he won his first titles (the FIBA European League and the Greek Cup), Fortitudo Bologna of Lega Basket Serie A, the San Antonio Spurs, and the Orlando Magic before he retired in 1999. As a member of the U.S. men&#x27;s national team, Wilkins won gold at the 1994 FIBA World Championship.

==Early life==
Wilkins was born in Paris while his father was stationed in France as an officer in the U.S. Army. He has a younger brother, Gerald Wilkins, who also played in the NBA, mainly for the New York Knicks. His family moved to Dallas and Baltimore before settling in Washington, North Carolina, where he attended Washington High School. He was the back-to-back MVP for the team&#x27;s consecutive Class 3-A State Championships (1978–1979). Wilkins was in the &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot; section of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; while in high school for a performance in a game vs. a higher classification school in which he scored 48 points, had 27 rebounds, 9 dunks, and 8 blocks. Wilkins then starred in the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game, the Capital Classic, the Kentucky Derby Festival Classic, and the Dapper Dan Classic all-star games. He had 16 points and 12 rebounds in the McDonald&#x27;s game, 26 points in the Capital Classic, and 22 points in the Derby Classic.

==College career==
Wilkins entered the University of Georgia in 1979 with a reputation as an exciting player and left as the “Human Highlight Film”. He averaged 21.6 points a game over his Bulldogs career and was named to the All-Southeastern Conference First Team in 1981. Likely to go as one of the very top picks of the 1982 NBA draft, he left college after his junior year.

==Professional career==

===Atlanta Hawks (1982–1994)===
Wilkins was selected third overall (behind James Worthy and Terry Cummings) by the Utah Jazz in the 1982 NBA draft. However, Wilkins was not willing to play in Utah; the team wanted him to play power forward, while he wanted to play small forward. At the same time, the Jazz were reeling from cash flow problems. As a result, the Jazz traded Wilkins to the Atlanta Hawks several months after the draft for John Drew, Freeman Williams and $1 million in cash. The trade is now considered among the most lopsided deals in NBA history, as Drew and Williams would play a combined four seasons for the Jazz.

Wilkins averaged more than 25 points per game for ten consecutive seasons, and captured a scoring title in 1985–86 with an average of 30.3 points per game.

Wilkins was instrumental in the Hawks&#x27; prominence in the 1980s, when the club recorded four consecutive 50-win seasons during the decade. As Wilkins entered his thirties and the Hawks needed more of an all-around contribution from their star, Wilkins averaged 9.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists during the 1990–91 season.

A nine-time NBA All-Star and the winner of two NBA slam dunk contests, Wilkins registered 26,668 points and 7,169 rebounds in his NBA career. As of 2024, he ranks 17th on the NBA scoring list.

Wilkins&#x27;s nickname was &quot;The Human Highlight Film&quot; for his athletic ability and highlight reel dunks. His trademark dunk was a powerful one- or two-handed windmill dunks he used to capture the slam dunk contest titles in 1985 and 1990. As a basketball player, he was known as an acrobatic scorer, somewhat of a gunner, though an outstanding finisher and one of the greatest dunkers in NBA history.

His #21 jersey was retired by the Hawks on January 13, 2001. He is one of five players whose jerseys have been retired by the Hawks.

====Early years (1982–1987)====
Wilkins notched his first Slam-Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Indianapolis during the 1984–85 season. He went on to finish the season with a 27.4 scoring average, good for sixth in the NBA. He ranked second on the Hawks in rebounding (6.9 rpg) and steals (135). For the first of two straight seasons, he led the NBA in field-goal attempts, with 1,891. After going 0-for-11 from the three-point line the previous season, Wilkins made 25 of 81 three-point shots in 1984–85. He also shot better than 80 percent from the free throw line for the first of 10 consecutive seasons. Despite Wilkins&#x27;s efforts, Atlanta finished 34–48 and failed to reach the playoffs.

Wilkins exploded into the NBA&#x27;s elite circle in 1985–86, winning the league scoring title with an average of 30.3 points per game. He was an NBA All-Star for the first time and was voted to the All-NBA First Team at the end of the season. He failed in his bid to repeat as NBA Slam-Dunk champion, his competition coming from an unlikely source. The Hawks had signed 5-foot-7 Anthony &quot;Spud&quot; Webb as a free agent prior to the season, and Webb dazzled the All-Star Saturday crowd in Dallas by soaring more than to the basket on each of his dunk attempts. Atlanta turned its fortunes around in dramatic fashion, winning 16 more games in the 1985–86 season to finish 50–32 for the year. Wilkins scored 57 points in one game and ranked among the Hawks&#x27; leaders in rebounding (7.9 rpg), steals (138), and free-throw percentage (.818). Atlanta beat the Detroit Pistons in four games in the first round of the playoffs, but the Hawks could not get past the eventual NBA-champion Boston Celtics, losing four games to one in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Wilkins averaged 28.6 points in the nine playoff games.

After playing as a reserve the previous year, Wilkins became the first Atlanta Hawks player to start in an NBA All-Star Game since Eddie Johnson in 1981. Wilkins finished the year second in the league in scoring (29.0 ppg) to Michael Jordan&#x27;s 37.1 points per game. He scored the 10,000th point of his career against the Chicago Bulls on April 16 and was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the season&#x27;s end. Atlanta went into the season with high expectations after a 50–32 mark the previous year, and the Hawks totaled a franchise-record 57 victories. Doc Rivers, Kevin Willis, Tree Rollins, and Mike McGee contributed as the club made it through the first round of the NBA playoffs before losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Detroit Pistons. Wilkins averaged 26.8 points during the postseason, the second of six straight playoffs in which he would average at least 20 points.

====Late 1980s (1987–1990)====
In the 1987–88 season, Wilkins posted the highest scoring average of his career and finished second to Jordan in the NBA scoring race. He averaged 30.7 points for the Hawks, but Jordan bested him at 35.0. Jordan also defeated Wilkins for the Slam Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago. Wilkins earned a berth on the All-NBA Second Team and became the first Hawks player to be named NBA Player of the Week three times in a season. In his third straight All-Star Game appearance, Wilkins scored 29 points on 12-of-22 shooting, leading the East squad to a 138–133 victory.

Atlanta (50–32) won at least 50 games for the third straight season and advanced to the 1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals before losing to the Boston Celtics in seven games. In Game 7 on May 22, Wilkins and Larry Bird carried their respective teams to a thrilling finish, trading bucket for bucket in the fourth quarter until Boston won with a 118–116 victory. Wilkins finished with 47 points and Bird had 34-with 20 of his points tallied in the fourth quarter. &quot;The basket was like a well,&quot; remembered Wilkins. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t miss. He couldn&#x27;t miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That&#x27;s the greatest game I&#x27;ve ever played in or seen played. It was two guys who just did not want to lose.&quot;

During the 1989 season with the Hawks, Wilkins&#x27;s scoring average dropped slightly to 26.2, good for seventh in the league, but he was an All-Star for the fourth straight year. He shot a career-best .844 from the free-throw line and ranked second on the Hawks with 117 steals. Basketball writers selected him to the All-NBA Third Team at season&#x27;s end. The Hawks added Reggie Theus and Moses Malone to the team in 1988–89. Malone averaged 20.2 points and finished fourth in the league with his 11.8 rebounding average. Theus averaged 15.8 points. Without Kevin Willis, however, who missed the entire season with a fractured left foot, Atlanta lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. Wilkins averaged 27.2 points in the playoffs.

Wilkins returned to dunking prominence in 1989–90 by edging out the Sacramento Kings&#x27; Kenny Smith for his second NBA Slam-Dunk championship. He averaged 26.7 points to finish fifth in the NBA scoring race. He led the Hawks in steals for the first time since 1985–86, finishing with 126. His .484 field-goal percentage was the best since his rookie season, and for the sixth straight year he did not foul out of a game. Nonetheless, Atlanta struggled to a 41–41 record in Mike Fratello&#x27;s last season as head coach, failing to make the playoffs for only the second time in Wilkins&#x27;s career.

====Final years in Atlanta (1990–1994)====
Wilkins averaged a career-high 9.0 rebounds in 1990–91, leading the Hawks in that category for the first time in his nine NBA seasons. He also led the team in scoring for the eighth straight year, finishing at 25.9 points per game—seventh best in the NBA. He registered a career-high 265 assists while developing a three-point shot he would use more and more in the later stages of his career. He hit 85-of-249 from long range for a .341 percentage, by far his most prolific three-point numbers to date. Wilkins made his sixth All-Star Game appearance, scoring 12 points in the East&#x27;s 116–114 victory over the West. He was selected to the All-NBA Second Team for the third time in his career. Atlanta returned to the playoffs after a year&#x27;s absence, drawing the defending NBA champion Detroit Pistons in the first round. The Hawks pushed the Pistons to a fifth game, but Detroit routed Atlanta, 113–81, in Game 5. Wilkins averaged 20.8 points in the five games, but shot .372 from the field and .133 from three-point range.

In the 1991–92 season, Wilkins&#x27;s ruptured his Achilles tendon against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 28, 1992. He underwent surgery on January 30. He also scored the 20,000th point of his career, becoming only the 16th player at the time to reach that plateau. On the day of the injury, Wilkins was named a reserve on the Eastern Conference All-Star Team. His 28.1 scoring average was his highest in five years, and the 52 points he scored in a double-overtime game on December 7 against the New York Knicks were the most by an NBA player that season.

The following season, Wilkins recovered from his injury. He scored an average of 27.7 points per game in the first month of the season. On December 8, he set an NBA record of free throws made in a game without a miss, hitting 23 free throws against the Chicago Bulls. He then suffered a setback when he fractured the ring finger on his right hand on December 15, sitting out the next 11 games. He returned to rack up 29.4 points per game on .487 shooting in January, then added 31.5 points per game on .519 shooting in February. By the end of the season, his scoring average was up to 29.9, second in the league behind Michael Jordan&#x27;s 32.6. When Wilkins scored his 31st point in a February 2 game against the Seattle SuperSonics, he broke Bob Pettit&#x27;s franchise scoring record of 20,880 points. He had developed into a full-fledged three-point threat, hitting 120 of 316 attempts from long range to shatter his previous career bests. He was later selected to the All-NBA Second Team. The Chicago Bulls swept the Hawks in the first round of the playoffs 3–0.

===Los Angeles Clippers (1994)===
Wilkins showed no signs of fading in his 12th NBA season, even after a tumultuous midseason trade. After 11½ years with the Atlanta Hawks, Wilkins was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers on February 24 in exchange for Danny Manning. This is still the only time in NBA history a team in first place in their conference traded its leading scorer after the All-Star break. Prior to the trade Wilkins averaged 24.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 2.3 assists for Atlanta, leading the club to a 36–16 record. At midseason he appeared in his eighth NBA All-Star Game. Hawks management and new coach Lenny Wilkens claimed Manning and his skills would help the team more during the stretch run. However, many believed that money was the primary reason the Hawks made the trade. Wilkins&#x27;s contract expired at the end of the season, and the Hawks may not have been willing to commit a new long-term contract to a player who was almost 35 years old.

The top-seeded Hawks lost in the conference semifinals to the Indiana Pacers. Wilkins left Atlanta as the team&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 23,292 points. In his final 25 games of the season Wilkins averaged 29.1 points and 7.0 rebounds. On March 25 he returned to Atlanta in a Clippers uniform and tallied 36 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. Overall, Wilkins&#x27;s 26.0 scoring average ranked fourth in the NBA. He concluded the season with 24,019 career points, placing ninth on the NBA&#x27;s all-time list.

===Boston Celtics (1994–1995)===
Wilkins became a free agent after the 1993–94 season and signed with the Boston Celtics. Shortly after the signing, he helped Dream Team II to a gold medal at the 1994 World Championship of Basketball. In his lone season with the Celtics, the team reached the playoffs but was eliminated in the first round by the Orlando Magic. Wilkins averaged 19.0 points for the series. He also holds the honor of scoring the Celtics final point at the old Boston Garden, before it closed in 1995, in their game four loss to the Magic.

===Panathinaikos (1995–1996)===
In August 1995, Pavlos and Thanasis Giannakopoulos, presidents of Panathinaikos, asked &quot;who is the best player worldwide right now&quot;, Dominique Wilkins was the answer and after that the well known phrase of Pavlos Giannakopoulos stayed in European Basketball history &quot;Bring him yesterday, not now, yesterday&quot;. Dominique Wilkins joined Panathinaikos of the Greek League, signing a two-year contract worth US$7 million that meant a US$3.5 million net sum per year in salary, at the time the richest deal for a professional basketball player outside the NBA. Despite Wilkins having two more years remaining on his contract with the Celtics, the Athens club, hungry for Euroleague success, stepped in by taking advantage of the said contract having a buyout clause. Arriving in Athens on 1 September 1995, Wilkins was greeted by 5,000 Panathinaikos fans at Ellinikon International Airport. The next day, 13,000 fans showed up for his first practice session. His club-provided accommodation in the city included a four-story, marbled villa of his choosing, a maid, two cars, while even his Greek taxes were paid for him by the club.

Playing on a roster alongside Stojko Vranković, Panagiotis Giannakis, Fragiskos Alvertis and Nikos Oikonomou, thirty-five-year-old Wilkins started off the season sluggishly, frequently getting targeted by the team&#x27;s disciplinarian, defensively-minded head coach Božidar Maljković, even getting fined US$50,000 by the club for making too many personal trips back to the United States during the season, and complaining about being treated &quot;like a dog&quot; by coach Maljković.

However, Wilkins soon managed to adapt and thrive in the European game, averaging 20.1 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.8 assists, in 33.2 minutes per game, in 17 games played for Panathinaikos in the 1995–96 season of the EuroLeague, and helping them win the title of the EuroLeague Final Four of 1996. He particularly excelled in key EuroLeague contests such as the deciding game 3 of the EuroLeague quarterfinals best-of-3 series, versus Treviso, where he recorded 26 points and 7 rebounds, as Panathinaikos eked out a hard-fought 64–65 victory on the road, to progress to the EuroLeague Final Four. During the 1996 EuroLeague Final Four, that was held in his birthplace of Paris, Wilkins had 35 points and 8 rebounds in the semifinal against CSKA, and a double-double, with 16 points and 10 rebounds against Barcelona in the final. His performances earned him the Final Four MVP award. He also won the Greek Cup with Panathinaikos, and was named the Cup Final MVP.

Wilkins, however, failed to lead Panathinaikos to the 1995–96 Greek League national championship, as they lost the Greek League Finals to their arch-rivals, Olympiacos, 3 games to 2. Controversially, Wilkins did not play in the deciding game 5 of the finals series, claiming injury—an assertion disputed by the team. Panathinaikos ended up losing the deciding game. On 19 June 1996, following the disappointing end of the Greek League season, Wilkins and his agent were reportedly notified by the club that the player&#x27;s contract would be terminated early, after only one season. On 27 June 1996, three days before the team would have had to pay a $1.75-million advance on his 1996–97 salary of $3.5 million, Wilkins and his agent Steve A. Kauffman had a lawsuit filed against them by Panathinaikos in a Massachusetts court, asking that Wilkins and his agent be barred from access to US$4 million in letters of credit granted earlier as part of the deal Wilkins had signed with the club the previous summer. The suit further cites four examples of Wilkins leaving the team without permission to attend to injuries or personal matters, including the one three days before the fifth and decisive game of the Greek Basketball Championships described in the lawsuit as &quot;Wilkins deserting the team and creating confusion on the part of his teammates&quot;. In the Greek League, he averaged 21.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists and 32.0 minutes per game in 30 games played.

===San Antonio Spurs (1996–1997)===
Wilkins returned to the NBA before the 1996–97 season, signing a contract as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs, to solidify their bench scoring. Wilkins led the team with an average of 18.2 points per game in 1996–97. He would be the last Spur to wear #21 before Tim Duncan who joined the team in the following season and Wilkins also became one of the first players to play under Gregg Popovich who made his head coaching debut with the team.

===Fortitudo Bologna (1997–1998)===
However, after one season, Wilkins once again went overseas, this time signing a contract with Teamsystem Bologna of the Italian League, for the 1997–98 season. With Bologna, he averaged 17.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.5 minutes per game, in 34 games played in the Italian League. With Bologna, he also averaged 17.9 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.8 minutes per game, in 20 games played in the FIBA EuroLeague 1997–98 season.

===Orlando Magic (1999)===
Wilkins returned to play his last season in the NBA, during the 1998–99 campaign, alongside his brother Gerald Wilkins, with the Orlando Magic. In 27 games, he averaged 5.0 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.

===Slam dunk contests===
Wilkins participated in five slam dunk contests, winning two. His first was in 1984, in Denver. Wilkins finished third, behind Larry Nance and Julius Erving. In 1985, in Indianapolis, he beat Michael Jordan in the finals. In Dallas in 1986, a Jordan-Wilkins rematch was put on hold, since Jordan was injured. Wilkins reached the finals where he was defeated by his 5&#x27;6&quot; teammate, Spud Webb.

The 1988 Slam Dunk Contest featured a rematch between Wilkins and Jordan. Jordan won in the final, beating Wilkins by two points. Wilkins&#x27;s first two dunks of the finals earned scores of 50 from judges. On his third and final attempt, Wilkins&#x27;s completed a thunderous windmill dunk from the left side. Soaring high above the floor, Wilkins&#x27;s head nearly hit the rim. Wilkins received a standing ovation from players and fans in attendance, but was awarded a low score of 45. The judges opened the door for Jordan to win the Chicago-based event with a score of only 48. Jordan closed out the event with 50-point dunk, taking perhaps the contest&#x27;s most controversial crown.

In 1990 Wilkins made his final appearance in the Slam Dunk Contest, going up against new promising stars such as Kenny Smith, Scottie Pippen and Kenny Walker (the 1989 champion). He defeated Kenny Smith of the Sacramento Kings in the final round.

==Post-playing career==
Since 2004, Wilkins has served as the Hawks&#x27; Vice President of Basketball. He works in a variety of management functions within the franchise&#x27;s basketball and business areas. Wilkins is responsible for advising the Hawks&#x27;s senior management team on basketball-related issues and is a goodwill ambassador for the community. Wilkins also serves as a color analyst for Hawks games on Bally Sports, pairing with long-time play-by-play announcer Bob Rathbun.

Wilkins was a judge in the 2008 NHL All-Star Game Breakaway Challenge, which was held in Atlanta.

In 2009 Wilkins participated in the McDonald&#x27;s All-Star Celebrity Game during NBA All-Star Weekend and in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge against a team of Philippine Basketball Association All-Stars. He led all scorers with 28 points in 20 minutes of play.

In 2010 Wilkins signed an agreement to partner with fitness company 24 Hour Fitness to develop the Dominique Wilkins Basketball Academy. The academy conducted private training, camps, and clinics at the 24 Hour facility in Pearl City, Hawaii. In late 2010, Wilkins starred with Verne Troyer in the TitleMax &quot;short on cash?&quot; television commercial campaign.

Recently Wilkins released the first of his private label wines under the Wilkins Private Reserve label. He took an interest in fine wines while playing professionally in Italy at the end of his career and owning a private label was one of his long-term goals.

In March 2014 Wilkins, whose father and grandfather both died of diabetic complications, filmed a commercial for Novo Nordisk&#x27;s Victoza citing their commitment to raising awareness of diabetes in the urban community, with an emphasis on children&#x27;s nutrition.

On March 6, 2015, the Atlanta Hawks organization unveiled a statue of Wilkins that sits in front of then-titled Philips Arena, and now State Farm Arena.

==Personal life==
Wilkins&#x27;s stepson, Isaiah Wilkins, played for the University of Virginia and was the 2018 ACC Defensive Player of the Year.

<doc id="613068" wikidata="Q6569880" url="?curid=613068" title="List of Elfquest characters">
<text>This is a list of characters in &quot;Elfquest&quot;, the science fiction/fantasy comic book series created in 1978 by Wendy and Richard Pini.

The initial list is derived from the original series, which Warp Graphics published in 1978–1984. Later series introduced numerous additional characters; about 650 have been mentioned by name at least once.

==Wolfrider Elves==
* Bearclaw (male; soulname: Grenn): Son of Mantricker and Thornflower, possible half-brother of Moonshade, lifemate of Joyleaf, father of Cutter, grandfather of Suntop (Sunstream), Ember, and Goldruff, adoptive grandfather of Shuna, great-grandfather of Korafay. Tenth chief of the Wolfriders, Bearclaw took risks, lived in &quot;the now&quot;, and provoked humans for amusement. He had brown hair, grey eyes, a beard and thin moustache. He was known for rowdiness, gambling with trolls, and a fine taste for dreamberry wine. He also was fiercely protective of his tribe. Bearclaw was killed by the monster Madcoil after mortally wounding it. At the end of his life, Bearclaw&#x27;s wolf friend was Blackfell, after the death of his wolf Snapper. Other known wolf-friends include Crest, who knew Bearclaw&#x27;s soul name, and Snapper, who died of poisoning.
* Buckthorn (male; soulname: Prye): Recognized lifemate of Hummer, father of Sprout and Sharpsight. He lived during Mantricker&#x27;s time. He tried to prove he was better at anything than anyone, which resulted in his age-mate Hummer constantly challenging him to competitions in which she mostly bested him. Because she did not have any patience, he challenged her to a staring contest. He was known for participating in the strangest Recognition in Wolfrider history, as he recognized Hummer after two days and two nights.
* Clearbrook (female): Lifemate of One-Eye and later Treestump, mother of Scouter and an unnamed daughter (sometimes thought to have been called Moth or Moss), grandmother of Pool and adoptive grandmother of Windkin. Clearbrook is a tribal elder of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders and is very serene and wise. One known wolf-friend is Whitebrow, though there are others. 
* Cutter (male; soulname: Tam): Also called Kinseeker and Blood of Ten Chiefs, Cutter is the son of Bearclaw and Joyleaf, many possible deceased siblings and half-siblings, grandson of Mantricker and Thornflower, nephew of Treestump (brother of Joyleaf), first cousin of Dewshine, first cousin once removed of Windkin, Recognized lifemate of Leetah (of the Sun Folk), father of Suntop (later called Sunstream), Ember, and Goldruff, adoptive father of Shuna. He is grandfather of Korafay and adoptive grandfather of Shukopek, and the eleventh chief of the Wolfriders. His wolf-friends have been Nightrunner, Warfrost, Holdfast, Filcher for the majority of &quot;Final Quest&quot;, and finally Loper. Brave, strong, valiant, wise in the ways of leadership and change and with a deep love and concern for his tribe, he was killed by spider bite near the end of &quot;Final Quest&quot;. Cutter is the main character of the &quot;Elfquest&quot; saga.
* Dart (male; soulname: Dyrr): Son of Strongbow and Moonshade, younger brother of (the deceased) Crescent, older brother of Chitter, grandson of Trueflight, Brightwater and possibly Mantricker, Recognized to Serrin (daughter of the Wolfrider Wing, and of Behtia of the Sun Folk), father of (deceased) Bowki, lifemate of Shushen (deceased, of the Sun Folk) close friend of Kimo, former lifemate of Talmah (of the Sun Folk), lifemate of the Wolfrider Mender. Head of the Jackwolfriders, Dart, a natural leader, took it upon himself as a young child to teach the Sun Folk to defend themselves, and later led a lengthy, fateful expedition to the far-southern Forevergreen forest. Dart has significant ability at weaponless martial-arts-like fighting and teaches his skills to all who ask. He is now a tribe member of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders, living in the Father Tree Holt. He aids the adopted human Shuna in her endeavors to reach out to the human tribes surrounding the Holt&#x27;s forest, and has recently lifemated to Mender.
* Dewshine (female; soulname: Lree): Daughter of Treestump and Rillfisher, niece of Joyleaf, first cousin of Cutter, first cousin once removed of Ember and Sunstream, Recognized to but not lifemate of Tyldak (of Blue Mountain), mother of Windkin, adoptive mother of Pool, grandmother of Teir, lifemate of Scouter and Tyleet. Dewshine is a huntress and gatherer, singer, dancer, storyteller, and the fastest runner and most dexterous of all the Wolfriders. She regularly &quot;scares her tribemates to death&quot; with daring leaps and jumps from and to high places. She is a tribe member of Ember&#x27;s Wolfriders. Trollhammer, one of her wolf-friends, ironically was killed by a troll&#x27;s hammer; another of Dewshine&#x27;s wolf-friends was the pack leader Longshanks.
* Ember (female; soulname: Zheel): Daughter of Cutter and Leetah, twin sister of Suntop/Sunstream, sister of Goldruff, adopted sister of Shuna, granddaughter of Bearclaw, Joyleaf, Toorah and Anatim (Suntoucher), niece of Shenshen, first cousin once removed of Dewshine and great-niece of Treestump, aunt of Korafay, former lovemate of Mender, lifemate of Teir. Ember is twelfth chieftess of the Wolfriders and first chieftess of the Wolfrider previously living on Khulki&#x27;s Mountain in the New Land. Creative, resourceful, brave, compassionate and forward-thinking, Ember has medium brown skin inherited from her Sun Folk mother, fire-red hair and aqua-colored eyes. Her known wolf-friends have been Choplicker and Patches. Her preferred weapon is the spear.
* Freefoot (male): Son of Huntress Skyfire and possibly Dreamsinger, brother of Nightstar, father of Tanner, Fangslayer, and Longoak by his lifemate Starflower. He was a wanderer and secretly sired a son by recognizing a member of the foreparents of the Go-Backs, then a Goatrider, Two-Shadows, when he wandered on the plains. The son&#x27;s name was Hawkcatcher. He only encountered his son much later and was attacked by him, Hawkcatcher believing his mother&#x27;s death was caused by Freefoot&#x27;s abandonment. He was forced to kill the boy and bury him on the plains. He told no one, but it did not ruin his wandering habits. A sixth chief of the Wolfriders, he died when, while rescuing elf &quot;cubs&quot; (children) from a tree during a thunderstorm, he was struck by lightning (ironically, &quot;skyfire&quot;).
* Freetouch (female; formerly Chitter): Daughter of Strongbow and Moonshade, sister to Crescent (deceased) and Dart, lovemate to Pool, Sust, Mender, and others. She was conceived and born during the events of &quot;The Searcher and the Sword&quot;. After Strongbow and Moonshade received a vision from the spirit of their daughter Crescent about &quot;joy above and danger below&quot;, it turned out the &quot;joy above&quot; was that the couple had Recognized for the third time. Two years later, Moonshade gave birth to Chitter, presumably named because she was a hyperactive toddler who talked and made animal sounds non-stop. Unlike Strongbow, who prefers sending over talking, Chitter liked to talk to anyone within hearing range and usually asked her father to not &quot;think-talk&quot;, but &quot;talk like Shuna&quot;. When she grew up, she changed her tribe name to Freetouch and left to join Ember&#x27;s tribe as their tanner. She has light reddish-brown hair and violet eyes.
* Foxfur (female): Member of Bearclaw&#x27;s tribe known for her namesake fox fur cap, and young Skywise&#x27;s lovemate despite her greater age, she was killed in Madcoil&#x27;s rampage against the Wolfriders.
* Goldruff (male): Son of Cutter and Leetah (born after Cutter&#x27;s death), brother of Sunstream and Ember, adoptive brother of Shuna, grandson of Suntoucher, Toorah, Bearclaw, and Joyleaf. He is lovemate of Jink, Nokkah, and possibly others, and a father of deceased unnamed son. Born two years after the death of his sire, Goldruff resembles Cutter so much that he serves as a living reminder. He grew up listening to stories of the father he never knew; his favorites were the ones about Cutter and Skywise. Despite his sister Shuna being human, Goldruff developed a strong dislike for humans and an intense hatred for their weapons, due to having lost his son to a bullet from a &quot;fire-spitter&quot;.
* Goodtree (female; soulname: Neme): Daughter of Tanner and Stormlight, lifemate to both Lionleaper and Acorn, mother of Mantricker and Speedwell, possible grandmother of Spark. The eighth chief of the Wolfriders, she was the only wolf chief with plant-shaping ability and began the shaping of what would become the tribe&#x27;s first Father Tree, later referred to as &quot;Goodtree&#x27;s Rest&quot;. It is believed she is the great-grandmother of Redlance, through her daughter Speedwell.
* Hummer (female; soulname: Wirr): Recognized lifemate of Buckthorn, mother of Sprout and Sharpsight, she lived during Mantricker&#x27;s time. It is not known what tribe name she was born with but when she became older she changed it to Hummer, after the hummingbirds she would imitate. She went to prove herself better than her age-mate Buckthorn, which culminated in a staring contest. She was known for participating in the strangest Recognition in Wolfrider history, as she and Buckthorn recognized after staring at each other for two days and two nights.
* Joyleaf (female; soulname: Dehl): Sister of Treestump, aunt of Dewshine, great-aunt of Windkin, Recognized lifemate of Bearclaw, mother of Cutter, grandmother of Ember, Suntop, later called Sunstream, and Goldruff and great-grandmother of Korafay. Joyleaf had long, curly blond hair and blue eyes and was very wise and kind, moderating many of Bearclaw&#x27;s rash decisions by her gentle influence. Despite this, she was a very keen hunter. She was one of the victims of the monster Madcoil. One of her wolf-friends was called Shadowsheen.
* Kimo (male): Son of Newstar and Lutei (a Sun Villager who was unnamed until Wendy Pini revealed his identity in a July 2006 online column), grandson of Woodlock and Rainsong, great-grandson of Rain the Healer, soulbrother of Dart, close friend of Shuna, the adopted human daughter of Cutter and Leetah. Kimo has blue eyes, blue-black hair, and medium brown skin inherited from his Sun Folk sire. Under the tutelage of Timmain, he has recently developed his shapeshifting talent and often turns himself into a wolf. Kimo, who grew up in the Sun Village, became part of Cutter&#x27;s tribe. With Dart, he aids Shuna in her outreach efforts to the human tribes surrounding the Father Tree Holt&#x27;s forest, so much so that he made the decision to stay behind with her when the palace leaves the World of Two Moons. He was slain during the battle against the invading Djunslander army.
* Mantricker (male): Son of Goodtree and Lionleaper, younger brother of Speedwell (a female who was killed in early adulthood), father of Bearclaw and possibly others, and lovemate of Moonshade&#x27;s mother Brightwater. Ninth chief of the Wolfriders, he was renowned for his constant trickery at the expense of nearby human tribes, yet he also forged a unique partnership with the human scout Demontricker, which helped keep the peace between elves and humans during Demontricker&#x27;s lifetime. In later generations, the human tribes kept up their harassment of the Wolfriders, and in desperation Mantricker kidnapped a human boy and cut his face as a warning. A band of human trackers angrily fired blind arrow-shots and spears toward the elf; one spear found its mark, killing the chief. The boy, later revealed as &quot;Scar&quot;, held a grudge against elves until his death at Bearclaw&#x27;s hands. Mantricker had dark brown hair and brown eyes.
* Mender (male): Youngest son of Rainsong and Woodlock, brother to Newstar and Wing, former lovemate of Ember, Yun, and Freetouch, and a lifemate of Dart. Mender grew up in the Sun Village, but later joined the Wolfriders in the New Land, in part to find his heritage, and also to learn from Leetah to use his healing abilities to their best. Mender accompanied Cutter and the other warriors in the battle with Grohmul Djun for the shards of the palace. After the palace was restored, he joined Ember&#x27;s tribe when Leetah returned to Cutter&#x27;s. Though briefly told about Teir, he did not learn the extent of the elf&#x27;s involvement with Ember until years later. At first, Mender tried to sabotage the budding relationship, refusing to become a &quot;golden Rayek to that black-haired Cutter&quot;. It took years before he came to terms with their romance. He became lovemate with Yun, but the relationship ended when she left Ember&#x27;s tribe to join Cutter&#x27;s. He then developed romantic feelings towards Dart, feelings that deepened until they became lifemates. He has long, blond hair and crystal blue eyes.
* Moonshade (female; soulname: Eyrn): Daughter of Brightwater and possibly of Mantricker, possible half-sister of Bearclaw, lifemate of Strongbow and mother of Crescent (deceased), Dart and Freetouch. She was the leatherworker of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders, and taught her own skills to Tyleet, Shuna, and Freetouch. She was quiet and not a natural fighter, utterly devoted and perhaps a bit subordinate to her lifemate. Recently, she had her wolf-blood removed by Leetah, thus rendering her immortal, to Strongbow&#x27;s dismay. Though she chose to leave with the palace while her family decided to stay on the World of Two Moons, a short time later Moonshade threw herself in front of Strongbow when a human war-man threatened to shoot him and took the bullet meant to kill him, dying in his arms shortly afterwards. Moonshade had brown curls, violet eyes, and occasionally a bit of a temper and sharp tongue. She was a tribe member and elder of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders.
* Newstar (female): Daughter of Rainsong and Woodlock, sister of Mender and Wing, granddaughter of Rain, niece of Pike, cousin of Sust, lifemate of (the deceased) Lutei of the Sun Folk, mother of Kimo, and occasional lovemate of Skywise. She is very slender and has extremely long straight blond hair and blue eyes; while she lived with the Sun Folk she maintained medium-brown skin, which, now having returned to the forest, has lightened. Newstar is often referred to as the &quot;elfiest elf&quot;. She grew up in the Sun Village, but is now a tribe member of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders.
* Nightfall (female; soulname: Twen): Daughter of Longbranch and Brownberry, niece of One-Eye, cousin to Scouter and his unnamed sister, lifemate of Redlance, mother of Tyleet, grandmother of Pool and the human nicknamed Little Patch. Huntress, gatherer, archer, valiant warrior, and great friend and protector of Cutter, with whom she was raised, Nightfall is one of the main characters of the series. She is a tribe member of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders.
* One-Eye (male; soulname: Sur): Brother of Longbranch, uncle of Nightfall, great-uncle of Tyleet, lifemate of Clearbrook, father of Scouter and an unnamed, deceased daughter, grandfather of Pool. Hunter and warrior, One-Eye had brown hair, a brown eye, and an eye patch. He was formerly called Woodhue before humans captured him and gouged out one of his eyes. One-Eye was killed by a Frozen Mountain troll while fighting to free his sword from another troll&#x27;s fallen body.
* Pike (male): Son of Rain, half-brother of Rainsong, uncle of Newstar, Wing, and Mender, great-uncle of Kimo and Serrin, briefly lovemate of the Go-Back, Vaya, lifemate of (the deceased) Krim and (the deceased) Skot, also of the Go-Backs, possible father of Cheipar (who died in infancy) and stepfather of Sust. Named for his great skill with a spear, he is frequently teased by the Wolfriders for his great love of (intoxicating) dreamberries. Mischievous, happy-go-lucky and a follower by nature, Pike is the howl-keeper (tribal storyteller) and eldest of Ember&#x27;s Wolfriders, until he left her tribe to rejoin Cutter&#x27;s in order to be closer to the palace and the spirits of his lifemates Skot and Krim.
* Prey-Pacer (male; soulname: Owm): Youngest child of Rahnee the She-Wolf and Zarhan Fastfire, lifemate of Softfoot, Recognized Wreath, father of Two-Spear, Dove, and Huntress Skyfire (by Wreath), and others. A third chief of the Wolfriders, he had brown eyes and hair.
* Rahnee the She-Wolf (female): Second daughter of Timmorn Yellow-Eyes and Valloa (also called Murrel, later renamed herself New-Wolf), mother of Prey-Pacer and many others, including Ice, Cat, Brighteyes, and Penda. She is the second chief of the Wolfriders and full sister of Laststar. She Recognized her lifemate Zarhan Fastfire multiple times until her &quot;death&quot;. When Zarhan sought her out, they discovered a new tribe of plains elves and answered the call of Recognition to different elves.
* Rain (male): Father (with unknown lifemate) of Pike and Rainsong, grandfather of Mender, Wing, and Newstar, great-grandfather of Kimo and (deceased) Serrin, great-great-grandfather of (deceased) Bowki. Healer of the Wolfriders until he was killed by Madcoil, Rain, not nearly as powerful as Leetah or even Mender, had soothing hands and could &quot;sing pain away&quot;. He is often referred to as &quot;Rain the Healer&quot;.
* Rainsong (female): Daughter of (deceased) Rain, half-sister of Pike, lifemate of (deceased) Woodlock, mother of Newstar, (deceased) Wing, and Mender, grandmother of Kimo and (deceased) Serrin, great-grandmother of Bowki (deceased). Utterly devoted to her unusually large brood of &quot;cubs&quot; (children), Rainsong was called &quot;Lifebearer&quot; and &quot;a wonder&quot; because she and Woodlock had their three offspring within 12 years, a very short time by elfin standards. Like her lifemate Woodlock and her son Wing, she died of old age at Sorrow&#x27;s End.
* Redlance (male; soulname: Ulm): Lifemate of Nightfall, father of Tyleet, grandfather of Pool and the human nicknamed Little Patch. Plant-shaper, gentle soul, excellent tracker, and lover of children, Redlance has red hair and &quot;face fur&quot; (a beard). Tribe member of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders and formerly called Redmark, she was given his new tribename after rescuing his chief Bearclaw from a longtooth (sabertooth tiger) using a spear.
* Rillfisher (female): Treestump&#x27;s first lifemate, and Dewshine&#x27;s mother. Fisher and gatherer, she was killed by a falling tree branch while fishing.
* Scouter (male; soulname: Jial): Son of Clearbrook and (deceased) One-Eye, brother of a deceased, unnamed sister, nephew of (deceased) Longbranch, first cousin of Nightfall, first cousin once removed and also Recognized lifemate of Tyleet, un-Recognized lifemate of Dewshine, father of Pool, adoptive father of Windkin, tribal scout and warrior. He has dark brown hair, sideburns, and brown eyes. Scouter has the best eyesight of both Wolfrider tribes, and possibly the worst temper as well, at least when it comes to protecting his family. When Dewshine and Pool are kidnapped by the human Lehrigen, he temporarily seized control of the tribe from Ember, but later returned the chieftainship to her. He is a tribe member of Ember&#x27;s Wolfriders.
* Huntress Skyfire (female): Daughter of Prey-Pacer and Wreath, half-sister of Two-Spear, lifemate of Dreamsinger, mother of Freefoot and Nightstar. Fifth chief of the Wolfriders, she gained control of the tribe after challenging her increasingly warlike, psychopathic brother to a duel. Skyfire lost the challenge and was grievously wounded, but Two-Spear, perhaps feeling his grip on the tribe slipping away, exiled himself along with about half the tribe members; his sister became leader of the rest. Skyfire formulated the Way of the Wolfriders, the ethic and habits by which they live.
* Skywise (male; soulname: Fahr): Son of Shale and Eyes High, soul brother of Cutter, considered part of Cutter&#x27;s family, father of Yun (daughter), father of (daughter) Jink (of the far future), perpetual &quot;ladies&#x27; man&quot;, and lover of the stars. Casual lovemates were known to include the Glider Aroree; Vurdah, Maleen and Ruffel of the Sun Folk; Newstar; and the unknown Go-back mother of Yun, among others. Skywise, whose parents died at the time of his birth, was raised by the entire tribe of Wolfriders. He is a tribe member of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders, appointed Master of the Palace by Timmain, considered one of the new High Ones, Recognized lifemate of the High One Timmain, whom he also had as a wolf-friend (in wolf shape). Skywise&#x27;s only other wolf-friend was Starjumper, who was killed in a challenge with Dodia&#x27;s jack-wolf Skimsand. He chose never to take another wolf-friend who would someday die. After being kidnapped by Rayek into the future, Skywise asked Leetah to take away his wolf-blood so that he could spend as much time as was needed to find a way back to his soul-brother. Ironically, only hours later, it was revealed that Cutter and the Wolfriders had spent most of the intervening 10,000 years in suspended animation until the kidnapped elves returned to them. Years later, Skywise achieved his lifelong dream of traveling to the stars, as he left with the palace along with Timmain and other elves.
* Strongbow (male; soulname: Wyl): Son of (deceased) Trueflight and an unknown father, lifemate of (deceased) Moonshade, father of (deceased) Crescent and of Dart and Chitter, grandfather of (deceased) Bowki. Archer and elder of Cutter&#x27;s band, Strongbow and his lifemate Moonshade are the tribal conservatives, standing fast against unwise change and acting as keepers of the Way of the Wolfriders. Strongbow&#x27;s psychic &quot;sending&quot; ability is the strongest of any Wolfrider but the powerful Sunstream; of the rest, only Cutter approaches his mental range and force. After exposure to the restored Palace, Strongbow develops the ability to shoot his prey without aiming, even through trees and over obstructions. He has russet brown hair and eyes and &quot;face fur&quot;. His known wolf-friends have been Briarsting, Lashpaw and Gnawbone. He chose to stay on the World of Two Moons, even after Moonshade decided to go with the palace. After he lost his lifemate when she died trying to save him from humans, and after Cutter&#x27;s death, he joins Skywise in travelling the stars. An elf believed to be Strongbow (and referred to as &quot;Archer&quot;) appears in the time of &quot;Jink of the Future Folk&quot;.
* Sunstream (male; formerly called Suntop; soulname: Klynn): Son of Cutter and Leetah, twin brother of Ember, brother of Goldruff, adopted brother of Shuna, grandson of Anatim (Suntoucher), Toorah, Bearclaw and Joyleaf, nephew of Shenshen, great-nephew of Treestump, first cousin once removed of Dewshine, second cousin of Windkin. He is Recognized lifemate of Brill of the Wavedancers; their relationship is long-distance. He has blond hair and blue eyes and is by far the tallest of the Wolfriders. Member of Cutter&#x27;s tribe, he is one of at least nine known elves who can &quot;go out&quot; into the spirit world. Sunstream, whose sending power is almost unlimited, has a deep magic-sensing ability and is to become the conduit by which all elves communicate over long distances.
* Tanner (male; originally named Oakroot; soulname: Lhu): Son of Freefoot and Starflower, lifemate to Stormlight, father of Goodtree. Seventh chief of the Wolfriders, he had one of the longest tribal reigns (some 700 years) and certainly one of the most peaceful, marked by the absence of run-ins with humans. He stumbled across the method for tanning leathers, after a human hunter (jokingly referred to as &quot;Lift-Leg&quot;) inadvertently urinated into a bundle of skins he was storing.
* Timmorn Yellow-Eyes (male): The first Wolfrider chief and the first Wolfrider ever, he is the son of Timmain (a High One who had shaped herself into a wolf) and a true male wolf, lifemate to Valloa (also called Murrel or New-Wolf), but lovemate to many others, father of Rahnee the She-Wolf, Wreath, Laststar, Threetoe the Father, Frost, Glowstone, Sharpears, Journey, and many others. Even Timmorn never knew how many children he had fathered.
* Treestump (male): Brother of Joyleaf, uncle of Cutter, lifemate of Rillfisher (deceased) and now Clearbrook, father of Dewshine, grandfather of Windkin, great-grandfather of Teir, great-uncle of Sunstream and Ember. Hunter and warrior, Treestump is the Wolfriders&#x27; most robust and physically powerful tribe member. Treestump was once named Birdcall; his name was changed when, during an attack by trolls, he refused to be moved, thus saving himself and Bearclaw. He has curly blond hair and thick &quot;face fur&quot;. Treestump, the oldest living Wolfrider, is second-chief of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders, and up until recently has been the one to take over when Cutter is absent. Due to the need of Cutter&#x27;s Wolfriders for metal weapons, with great difficulty Treestump has recently taught himself blacksmithing, using tools left behind by trolls. His work has become such that it has even been complimented by the master smith Two-Edge, which Treestump considers the highest praise earned.
* Two-Spear (male; soulname: Marr): Son of Prey-Pacer, lifemate to Willowgreen, brother of Huntress Skyfire and Dove, father of Kahvi (the future Go-Back chieftess), grandfather of Vaya (deceased), Venka and Teir. Fourth chief of the Wolfriders, he went by the tribe name Swift-Spear until humans killed his wolf-friend Blackmane while the two were psychically connected. Many Wolfriders, including his sister Skyfire, believed that event to be the beginning of the madness Two-Spear was famous for; it was also the beginning of his deep and abiding hatred for humans. Later, he launched a brutal attack on a neighboring tribe of humans he believed to blame for the death of his elder sister Dove, an attack which his sister Skyfire feared would lead to an all-out war that might annihilate the elves. Convinced her brother was slipping into insanity, she duelled with him to seize control of the tribe but failed, suffering near-fatal wounds in the process. Despite his victory, Two-Spear immediately quit the tribe along with a group of his supporters; his faction later evolved into the Go-Back tribe under the leadership of his daughter, Kahvi.
* Tyleet (female; soulname: Sohn): Daughter of Nightfall and Redlance, granddaughter of Brownberry and Longbranch, great-niece of One-Eye, first cousin once removed and Recognized lifemate of Scouter, lifemate of Dewshine, mother of Pool, and adopted mother of human son Little Patch. Huntress, linguist, and tanner, she has narrow, hazel eyes and wavy, light reddish hair in a distinctive triple-tiered hairdo; sometimes she gains white strands that her parents claim predict the coming winter&#x27;s severity and duration. Tyleet, probably the sweetest and gentlest of all the Wolfriders owing to her upbringing in a time of near-complete safety and security, is very fond of humans and once adopted and raised a human baby (Little Patch). Tyleet befriended a human family in order to learn the language of the New Land humans and pass it on to other elves, in order to aid in the recovery of the stolen Palace. A tribe member of Ember&#x27;s Wolfriders, her name means &quot;Healer&#x27;s Gift&quot;.
* Wing (male): Son of Woodlock and Rainsong, brother of Mender and Newstar, uncle of Kimo, Recognized lifemate of Behtia (of the Sun Folk), father of Serrin and grandfather of Bowki. He considered himself a Sun Villager and passed almost all of his long life there. He had his mother&#x27;s blond hair and blue eyes. He died of old age at Sorrow&#x27;s End a few hundred years after the passing of his parents.

==Sun Folk Elves==
* Ahdri (female): Granddaughter of Tekshu, great-great-granddaughter of Alekah, great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Savah, and a lovemate of Windkin and Two-Edge. Working near the Little Palace - a chunk of the Palace of the High Ones shaped by Ekuar and gifted to the Sun Folk in Kings of the Broken Wheel - one day, she discovered a latent ability to rock-shape that she later developed to defend Sorrow&#x27;s End and ultimately save the Sun Village, first from the nearby volcano&#x27;s eruption and later from attacking humans. In the act of saving the Little Palace from the troll Thuggop and the attacking humans, Ahdri took a human arrow in the back as she crossed the Bridge of Destiny. She collapsed the bridge with the troll on it and hid behind the sun symbol, where preservers wrapped her wounded body. She was later discovered by half-mad Holt-trolls tunneling under the desert and used her rock-shaping powers to unearth gems for them, to keep them from unwrapping and possibly killing her. She was discovered in a pit by Treestump and Clearbrook and eventually healed by Leetah. She reunited with Windkin, who had long thought her dead. After some years, she became lovemates with the half-troll, half-elf Two-Edge, whom she is helping to &quot;explore his elfin half&quot;. At some point between &quot;Final Quest&quot; and &quot;Stargazer&#x27;s Hunt&quot; she became chieftess of the Go-Backs. She has long, curly golden brown hair, and golden-brown eyes.
* Dodia (female): A member of the Jack-Wolfriders, Recognized mate of Door (Ekolin), and a mother of Harotim. Huntress and defender of her village, she has short black hair and purple eyes. Her jack-wolf, Skimsand, killed Skywise&#x27;s wolf-friend Starjumper in a challenge. Dodia attacked Door when his madness threatened Dart and the others captive inside the human city in the Forevergreen. Although at first she was later shown to have stayed in the Forevergreen and raise her son, No-Name, in secret, her history was retconned in &quot;Final Quest&quot; to show that she did, in fact, accompany her friends when they were rescued from the Forevergreen and lived in the palace with the other Sun Folk, giving birth to and raising her son Harotim. She was one of the elves who encouraged Ekolin to come into the palace to be greeted by love, rather than encase it in stone as he originally planned. Once he entered the palace, she introduced him to their son.
* Leetah (female): Daughter of Toorah and Anatim (better known as Suntoucher), sister of Shenshen, friend and former lovemate of Rayek, Recognized lifemate of Cutter, mother of Suntop (later renamed Sunstream), Ember, and Goldruff, adoptive mother of the human girl Shuna, grandmother of Shuna&#x27;s son Shukopek and Sunstream&#x27;s and Brill&#x27;s daughter Korafay. Throughout the story Leetah explores her powers over life and death and the moral implications that arise. She has medium brown skin, auburn hair and green eyes &quot;the color of new leaves&quot;, and she&#x27;s slightly taller than Cutter, not counting both of their hair. Her name means &#x27;healing light&#x27;.
* Maleen (female): Lovemate of Vurdah, Shenshen, Newstar, Ruffel and Skywise, she has long black hair and dark eyes.
* Rayek (male): Son of Jarrah and Ingen, friend and one-time lovemate of Leetah, one-time lovemate also of Kahvi who bore him the daughter named Venka, lovemate and soul-brother of Winnowill, and a grandfather of Satreeka, he has long straight black hair and amber eyes. He has many growing powers, such as telekinesis, floating, a paralyzing stare and the ability to shelter other elven spirits in his body. His name means &quot;Child of the Rocks&quot;.
* Ruffel (female): Lovemate of Vurdah, Maleen, Shenshen, Newstar and Skywise, she had blondish-red hair and blue eyes. Ruffel was killed by a lightning bolt.
* Savah (female): Daughter of Hassbet and an unknown father, mother of many Sun Villagers, lifemate of Yurek, great-great-great-great-grandmother of Ahdri. Last of the original settlers of the Sun Village, she is their gentle Mother of Memory. As their founder she is their unquestioned leader in all spiritual matters and her advice is valued, her wisdom considered sacrosanct. She has many magical abilities and her skills mean she is mentor at some point and to some extent to any villager with magical gifts. Rayek&#x27;s skills blossom under her tutelage. Later she becomes a mentor to Suntop/Sunstream and to Ahdri, when Ahdri&#x27;s long dormant rockshaping ability surfaces in the presence of the small palace. Savah&#x27;s shown magical abilities are: astral travel, sending (telepathy, common amongst elves, though rare in Sun Folk), sensing magic, creating soft illumination that seems tied to her souls presence and some degree of fire-starting (she lights the lamps at the Festival of Flood and Flower). She can also use her mental gifts to &quot;tame&quot; zwoots, a skill she passed on to Rayek. She has long silver hair and golden-brown eyes.
* Shenshen (female): Daughter of Toorah and Anatim a.k.a. Suntoucher, younger sister of Leetah, aunt of Sunstream, Ember, and Goldruff, grand-aunt of Shukopek and Korafay. In the &quot;Final Quest&quot; series, she is transformed (by her own wish) into a human to follow her calling as a midwife, since Elves bear children only infrequently. She has auburn hair and yellow-green eyes.
* Shushen (male): Lovemate and soul-brother of Dart, Shushen was among those killed in the Go-Back tribe&#x27;s attack on Sorrow&#x27;s End. He had dark hair and dark eyes.
* Sun-Toucher (male; given name: Anatim): Lifemate to Toorah, father of Leetah and Shenshen, grandfather of Sunstream, Ember, and Goldruff. He studies the sun and its patterns to guide Sun Villagers in their farming; he went blind in early adulthood by looking into the sun too often, but prefers this state and declines to have his daughter restore his sight and he says his blindness has allowed him to learn to &quot;see&quot; in other ways. He became a mentor to Skywise while the Wolfrider&#x27;s dwelled in the Sun Village and they would often study the skies together. He is considered the Sun Folk&#x27;s day to day leader and, after Savah, the tribe&#x27;s eldest.
* Thiro (male): An early lovemate of Leetah, Thiro was killed when a zwoot (a sort of camel-horse hybrid) Rayek had tamed suddenly came to its senses and attacked him. He had brown hair and blue eyes.
* Toorah (female): Lifemate of Anatim the Sun-Toucher and mother of Leetah and Shenshen. Before Leetah&#x27;s birth she provided the Sun Folk with a true healer, Toorah&#x27;s gift with a needle and thread and her many salves and unguents provided much needed medical aid to her folk. She appears to have similar coloring as her daughters but is always hidden in a full-length, hooded robe.
* Vurdah (female): A lovemate of Maleen, Ruffel, and Skywise, she greatly desired to Recognize Skywise, but eventually gave up. She had auburn hair and green eyes.
* Windkin (male): Recognized son of Tyldak and Dewshine, adopted son of Scouter, and a father of Teir by Kahvi, he can fly and has long, curly brown hair and brown eyes. Though he was born half Wolfrider, his wolf blood was forced from him through the dark magic of Winnowill&#x27;s shapechanging, making him immortal. Raised in the Sun Village, he becomes the lovemate of Savah&#x27;s handmaiden, Ahdri. In the &quot;Final Quest Prologue&quot;, he is found in the deserted Sun Village after having lived with Kahvi and Tyldak for a period of time. He is reunited with the rest of the Elves, including Ahdri, whom he thought dead.
* Yurek (male): Lifemate of Savah. Along with Savah, he was one of the original elves who fled a faraway forest to found Sorrow&#x27;s End. A rockshaper, he expended much effort in creating the Bridge of Destiny, a rock arch high above the village. After completing the Bridge of Destiny, his severely weakened form finally tumbled from the windy heights. In new art from Wendy Pini, he is revealed to have light auburn hair and violet eyes and the brown skin (tanned, not inherently brown as he and the other founders were originally forest dwellers) of other Sun Folk. His spirit was one of the ones who alerted Sunstream and the other living elves to Door&#x27;s journey and presence and his diabolical plans for the palace.

==Glider Elves==
Unless otherwise noted, all Gliders have the inherent ability to float/fly. Gliders are immortal and are considered First-, Second-, and Thirdborns of the original High Ones. They resided in Blue Mountain and are considered an extinct tribe.
* Lord Voll (male): Founder of the Gliders and a long-time lovemate of Winnowill, he states he is the child of High Ones, possibly Deir and Gibra, who had birthed a son called Vol in the years after the Palace fell. He was the leader of the Gliders for many years. He lived in a state of depression believing his people to be going stagnant and believed there were no more elven children. Upon seeing Ember and Suntop, he became rejuvenated, until a dark sending from Winnowill put him into a deep sleep. When Leetah woke him from his sleep he asked the Wolfriders to seek the Palace of the High Ones with him. When they declined he offered to help them find a new holt, but instead forced them to follow him to the palace. A projectile fired by trolls from a giant ballista impaled Voll and his bond-bird, Tenspan, killing both and earning the Wolfriders the scorn of many of the Gliders, with Aroree and Tyldak being possibly the only ones not to blame them.
* Winnowill (female): Once lovemated to Lord Voll and later Rayek&#x27;s love mate, mother of Two-Edge, and the first elf to master black sending, or pain telepathy, she was a healer, but after the Gliders retreated into the safety of Blue Mountain, her gift was not needed and festered. Her mental state degraded at the growing despair of realizing herself as useless in placid society. In order to cling to her remaining sanity, she purposely injured her fellow Gliders to practice her gift. She controlled the Chosen Eight, and secretly the lives of all Gliders. Voll once asked her to help the female Gliders bear children, and she did, only to make them miscarry in secret, knowing Blue Mountain would not support more of their kind. Winnowill finally decided to find the Palace for Voll&#x27;s sake and her own, and left the mountain alone, only to encounter an injured troll named Smelt, who had been sent to collect rockshapers. Winnowill nursed him back to health and, out of what she called &quot;perverse curiosity&quot;, seduced Smelt and mated with him. The half-elf, half-troll Two-Edge was the result of that union. Winnowill killed Smelt when he remembered what he had come to the mountain for, then locked up and tortured Two-Edge when the child threatened to go to Lord Voll to report what she had done. She returned to the Gliders as a sadistic megalomaniac, and has been the principal elfin villain of the series. When the arrival of the Wolfriders threatened to lead her people back to the outside world, she tried to prevent this. Later she tried to annihilate the Wolfriders. She spent about ten thousand years creating monsters and playing with the humans in the new land, known to some of them as Lady of the Waves. The Palace of the High Ones was destroyed when she tried to conquer it, and was thwarted by Rayek and his daughter Venka. She shape-changed herself into a human to attempt to gain mastery over the shards, but was thwarted again, this time by Rayek, Venka, the Wolfriders, and Timmain. Immediately before it was restored, she let herself be killed to free her soul, so that her spirit could wreak havoc worldwide using the Palace. Rayek intervened by absorbing her spirit into himself, claiming that since he once held all the spirits of the Gliders, he could hold her. Since that time she has been vying for control of his body, even occasionally reshaping it into her female form, and constantly resisting his efforts to make her renounce evil. Winnowill is gradually gaining more control over her magic, but the two elves are in constant struggle.
* Aroree (female): Member of the Chosen Eight and a lovemate of Skywise, Aroree was one of the Chosen Eight. Even after falling in love with Skywise and wanting to be free she was loyal to Winnowill and did not leave the Gliders until she kidnapped Windkin, Tyldak&#x27;s son, whom gave to Winnowill as a replacement for herself, triggering the events of &quot;The Siege of Blue Mountain&quot;. There is some tension between her and the other elves as a result of her kidnapping of the infant Windkin. She later helped both Rayek and Kahvi attain their destinations as she wanders the skies on her giant bondbird, Littletrill. She would later join the Wolfriders and became a respected member of the tribe, and a teacher. After the restoration of the palace she accompanied Venka, hoping to find Tyldak. She stayed with the Go-Backs after Venka became their chieftess. Many years later, she encountered a grown Windkin, who had come seeking her and Venka to inform them about Kahvi and Tyldak&#x27;s deaths and of Kahvi&#x27;s son, Teir. Windkin forgave Aroree for having kidnapped him, allowing her to finally forgive herself. She accompanied Venka and the Go-Backs to the palace. She and Aurek (Egg) later reunited with fellow Glider Ekolin (Door) when he entered the palace and tearfully watched as he died in their arms a short time later. She is very tall for an elf, with long blonde hair and large blue eyes; her nickname is Sad Eyes.
* Tyldak (male): Lovemate of Kahvi, recognized the Wolfrider Dewshine, father of Windkin, and grandfather of Teir. Tyldak loved flying so much that he asked Winnowill to re-shape his body to have wings instead of arms, so that he could truly fly. He was loyal to Winnowill, partly because he felt he owed her for this favor. He recognized Dewshine, resulting in the cub Windkin who floats. Winnowill later betrays him, chaining him to the throne hall floor, never again to fly. He was freed by Two-Edge during the frenzy of the Fall of Blue Mountain. He took the Go-Back chieftess Kahvi as his lovemate. He was extraordinarily devoted to her, and claimed he must &quot;protect&quot; her from herself. After being reunited with his son Windkin, the three went on a quest to find Winnowill, for Tyldak to regain his wingless appearance and Windkin to gain wings. They met many other humans groups, some which worshiped Tyldak and others who wanted him as a trophy. After being wounded by a human, Tyldak begged Kahvi to kill him, which she did by puncturing his neck and letting him bleed to death. After avenging his death and cremating his body, Windkin and Kahvi parted ways. Unshaped, Tyldak had curly golden brown hair and brown eyes.
* Aurek (male; formerly known as Egg): One of the rockshapers that were in a permanent trace, living only to fulfill their purpose. His was shaping the Egg of Six Spheres, a floating stone egg that showed in pictures the history of the elves - this was only possible because he had knowledge of it. After the death of Lord Voll he had a vision of Timmain, charging him with remembering, and starting to wake him up. He survived the fall of Blue Mountain with the help of Two-Edge and built a more humble home in the remains. Aurek created two &quot;eggs&quot;, one was destroyed with the Gliders, and the other was taken by Kahvi herself as a trophy for her people. With one of these Aurek showed Kahvi her own past and the origin of the Go-Backs to her. Thousands of years later, he came to live in the Palace of the High Ones, reuniting with fellow Glider Aroree and then Ekolin (Door), the latter of whom died a short time later. About a millennium later on the World of Two Moons, he becomes a mentor to Jink, the elf-woman living among the humans of Abode&#x27;s space age. He has pale hair and pale eyes, and seems to enjoy nature and animals. He has some small floating ability.
* Kureel (male): One of the Chosen Eight, loyal to Winnowill, and hostile toward the Wolfriders, the latter in part because they killed a young giant hawk that would have been his bond bird when grown. After the fall of Blue Mountain, he tried to kill Dart and his human friend Geoki, and was in turn killed by Strongbow. Deeply guilty for this albeit necessary act, Strongbow sought Kureel&#x27;s soul in the Palace to ask for forgiveness. For his part, Kureel was at peace and barely remembered the circumstances of his death, and with that circumstance in mind, granted Stongbow&#x27;s request immediately.
* Door (male; also called Ekolin): Recognized to Dodia and a father of Harotim, he shaped Winnowill&#x27;s secret chambers, and was put into a permanent trance after he had nearly let Two-Edge&#x27;s father escape. He stayed loyal to Winnowill, trying to keep the chambers secured even while Blue Mountain was collapsing, but Cutter forced him to make a way to the outside. The Hoan G&#x27;Tay Sho took him with them on their search for a new home in the rainforests of Sunholt, then spent the next 10,000 years building an elaborate elf-based religion around him, but it took him millennia to return to lucidity, which immediately turned to rage and hatred. He lured Windkin and some of the Jack-wolf riders to the Forevergreen, where he tried to draw Windkin on his side, to help him rebuild the Gliders, and to rule the humans. He Recognized the Sun Villager Dodia, who, ashamed at being pregnant by such an evil man, beat him with a club. At first, Door was presumed dead, but is later revealed in &quot;Final Quest&quot; that he survived the beating and, after kidnapping the Go-Back Chot, forced him to help find the shards of the Little Palace. Once he found it, he used his rock-shaping skills to journey underground until they were under the palace, with the intent of encasing it in stone and not allowing it to fly away until the other elves promised to worship him as their lord and leader. Unbeknownst to him, however, the spirits of the Rockshapers and Gliders sensed his presence and journey and alerted the living elves, including Sunstream. Rather than attack Door, elves living and spirit invited him to enter the palace and be greeted and forgiven. Unused to, and confused by, such love and compassion, an overwhelmed Ekolin came inside, where he was reunited with fellow Gliders Aurek and Aroree, the latter of whom he remembered as having taken care of him when he was Winnowill&#x27;s slave. He then saw Dodia, who introduced him to their son, Harotim, who resembled him in both form and rockshaping abilities. It was then Door realized he had actually grown very weary of his long life on the World of Two Moons. He soon died in Aroree and Aurek&#x27;s arms, his body &quot;dissolving&quot; and his spirit joining those of Lord Voll and the other deceased Gliders.
* Door (female; also called Innekah): A rockshaper in permanent trance, in charge of the main gate of Blue Mountain, she was killed in the mountain&#x27;s collapse.
* Reevol (male): One of the Chosen Eight, he was the one who took Dewshine out of Blue Mountain when the Wolfriders wanted to exchange her and Windkin for the Preservers.
* The other Chosen were Eresir, Talno, Oroleed, Hoykar (all male and deceased) and Yeyeen (female, deceased).
* Brace (male; also called Kaitek): One of many Gliders who became an unconscious &quot;tool&quot; within Blue Mountain, he became nothing but a living brace rock-shaping a doorway to prevent its collapse. He died in the fall of Blue Mountain.
* Harotim (male): Son of Door (Ekolin) and the Sun Villager Dodia. Originally, his mother Dodia stayed in the Forevergreen and raised her son, then called No-Name, in secret, keeping him in chains and preventing him from using his rockshaping abilities out of fear the evil spirit of his father would come claim him. In &quot;Final Quest&quot;, their histories were retconned so that, instead of living in a cave in the Forevergreen, Dodia accompanied her friends to the palace, where she gave birth to and raised her son, naming him Harotim. Harotim not only resembles his father in looks, he has also inherited Ekolin&#x27;s rockshaping abilities, but instead of shaping stone, he uses his powers to shape the crystal the palace is made of, becoming, in Dodia&#x27;s words, the most accomplished crystal-shaper. Harotim, along with Dodia and other elves, invited Ekolin inside the palace rather than encase it in stone. Father and son met for the first, and last, time, as Ekolin died a short time later.

==Go-Back Elves==
While the Go-Backs are technically immortal (with the possible exception of Kahvi and her descendants), they have lifespans no longer than—and often shorter than—those of the mortal Wolfriders, thanks to their warlike and reckless lifestyle; thus, in their attitudes toward life and death, they are more like the Wolfriders than like the other immortal elves.
* Kahvi (female): The original chief of the Go-Backs in the series, Kahvi is a daughter of Two-Spear and Willowgreen, former lovemate to Rayek, Cutter and Tyldak, as well as many others, mother of Vaya, Venka, Teir, and possibly more, and a grandmother of Satreeka. Very stubborn and rowdy, she was a strong, loyal chief. She was killed by the human Lehrigen. She had long brown hair and green eyes.
* Krim (female): Cave guard, she later gave birth to two sons, Sust and Cheipar. She was killed in a fight with Angrif Djun. She had short blonde hair and blue eyes.
* Chot (male): Zey&#x27;s second in command, he later adjusts to life in the Sun Village when he is spared, tormenting Suntop and falling in love with Shenshen. He later joins Jethel in Forevergreen. Years later, he is captured by Door and is forced to find the shards of the Little Palace and follow Door to the caverns underneath the larger Palace, which the latter planned to encase in stone. Once Door died, Chot tried to make off with the Little Palace but was caught by Windkin and brought before his fellow Go-Backs, who were disgusted with his betrayal and cowardice. He met up again with Yun, who gave him a &quot;beating that he was owed&quot;.
* Urda (female): Kahvi&#x27;s trusted friend, watcher of the children and co-second in command, she is presumed to have been killed by trolls. She had white hair and pale eyes.
* Mardu (female): Kahvi&#x27;s trusted second-in-command, who later serves as the Go-Backs&#x27; acting chief when Kahvi is away (which was increasingly often). She taunted Rayek constantly and was finally backhanded for her tongue. She has red-brown hair and brown eyes.
* Mirff (male): Lovemate to Venka and an unnamed female Go-Back, and a father of Venka&#x27;s daughter Satreeka.
* Skot (male): Cave guard, he is later killed in the &quot;Shards&quot; era battle for the Palace, shortly after fathering Sust and/or Cheipar. He had a strong desire to be a father. He had long dark brown hair and brown eyes.
* Vaya (female): Kahvi&#x27;s daughter and Pike&#x27;s one-time lovemate, she was captured in an opening skirmish in the Battle for the Palace while holding off the mountain trolls so the others could escape. She was brought before King Guttlekraw, who was about to torture her for military information. Both to protect the tribe and desiring a worthy death her enemies would never grant, she grabbed a dagger and lunged at the troll king, successfully provoking his guards to kill her before Guttlekraw could learn anything. Later, her discarded body was collected by Two-Edge and left in the secret armory clothed in armor to inspire her tribe to wear armor as well. She had brown hair and brown eyes.
* Venka (female): Kahvi and Rayek&#x27;s daughter, she is raised by the Wolfriders after her parents disappeared. Venka is a sister of Vaya (deceased) and Teir, lovemate to Zhantee, Mirff, and possibly others (including an unnamed female Go-Back), and a mother of Satreeka. Known for her temperance and her skill at countering Winnowill&#x27;s sendings, she believes her destiny is intertwined with the Go-Backs and wants to be their chief after her mother&#x27;s death. She gave leadership of the Go-Backs to Ember and Teir and left with the other elves in the palace when it departed the World of Two Moons. She has black hair and yellow eyes, and dark skin.
* Yif (male): This elf was healed by Leetah, but was later killed in the Elf-Troll War.
* Yun (female): Skywise&#x27;s daughter with an unknown Go-Back, an adoptive mother of Khorbasi, and a lovemater of Mender. Very stubborn and outspoken, she also loves the stars. She has white blonde hair and pale blue eyes.
* Zey (male): Possible son of Mardu, a young upstart who took over while Kahvi was out. His henchman was Chot. He attacked the Sun Folk pointlessly, starting a massacre on both tribes. They used Greymung&#x27;s old tunnels to get there. Kahvi kills him in the battle, as it turns out she was resting with the Sunfolk at the time. He had red-brown hair and dark eyes.

* Redcrest (male): Lifemate of Pearl, father of Strand and Kroosh, grandfather of Puffer, and a treeshaper. He has long red curls and green eyes.
* Reef (male): He has no living relatives and is a lovemate of Korafay. He was a healer, but lost this ability after being tormented by Winnowill when he tried to heal her. He lived for thousands of years with the WaveDancers as &quot;the Broken One&quot;, a misshapen creature who spoke nonsensically (almost in riddles), was unable to send, and refused to be healed. Only when the Wolfrider chief Cutter pieced together enough of his mutterings to figure out what happened did Reef finally decide to allow himself to be healed in the Palace. He eventually regains enough self-shaping ability to shift between his elfin form and that of a large, powerful, monstrous-looking creature. Despite his healing, he still lived in extreme fear of Winnowill&#x27;s spirit, until he finally had the chance to confront her. Once he realized that what she had done to him was a complete accident, he forgave her, allowing his spirit to finally be healed.

* Wavelet (female): Along with Wavecatcher as the other survivor of the ill-fated WaveDancer colony, she was adopted as an infant by a man of the Hungtsho (the tropical human tribe descended from the Hoan G&#x27;Tay Sho) and became revered for plant-shaping abilities that guaranteed the village bountiful harvests. She is recently rediscovered by Wavecatcher.
* Zephyr (male): Founder of Cavernsong, the colony of WaveDancers that was virtually wiped out during a human battle.

==Original WaveDancers elves==
This series, published in 1993–94, was produced by artist Jozef Szekeres and co-writers Julie Ditrich and Bruce Love of Black Mermaid Productions in Australia. Because of a legal dispute between that studio and Warp Graphics over the ownership of the characters, the series was stripped of its place as a canonical &quot;Elfquest&quot; story. A court settlement between Black Mermaid and Warp prevents either company from republishing the six-issue series in whole, with Black Mermaid having the rights to the characters of OWD and Warp Graphics the WaveDancers title/name.
* Ailsa was the soulmate of Brom and mother of Raenafel. She had long frosty white hair, and died in childbirth.
* Ausra was one of the original five High Ones who fled from the palace after the bloodbath with the humans. She was lost to the Wailing River and believed drowned, but returned later on the back of a white horned whale to save three of her companions. The other High One drowned. Ausra was the mother of the WaveDancer colony and taught the others how to coexist in the watery world. She wore a necklace with a large crystal talisman in the centre. The narwhal was her companion, and she was a flesh shaper and healer. After establishing the colony, she flesh-shaped her legs into a tail along with the other three first comers and some of the other elves from later generations.
* Barmek is the son of Kirith and Rhialdor, and does not take himself as seriously as his brother Jormak does. Barmek is smart and has very good instincts. He has the adventurous spirit of an explorer and is not afraid to take risks. Most of the time he is friendly and gentle, but if his loved ones are threatened he can be savage and show his teeth. Barmek is 5 feet tall, average height for a WaveDancer, with a crop of golden hair and laughing brown eyes. He recognises with Raenafel who he first accidentally encountered when he was just a young squirt.
* Brom is a father of Raenafel and soulmate of Ailsa, was the third generation Crown and younger half brother of Shardon. Brom was marked by the Cursemaker who flesh-shaped Brom&#x27;s hairline into a beard to look like the much feared humans. Brom hid his daughter to protect her from the Curse of Recognition, but after Barmek&#x27;s discovery he had to send her inland with No-Wing in search of the Palace of the High Ones. He was a strong, majestic and determined leader. He never rested and was ever vigilant and quite driven. He was about 5 feet 3 inches, with strands of white hair on his temples and a flowing grey beard that weighed him down in the water. He had green eyes and despite his age was strong and one not to be reckoned with.
* Burdekin is the lifemate to Zadori, and father to Shoresprout. He has a mane of red hair framed by a headband of decorative shells. He is a fun loving and playful elf and is devoted to his family, but he is easily influenced and led astray by Sydor. Burdekin is also one of the storytellers to the colony, and takes an active part in festivities.
* Hyfus is one of the rare tailed elves. He has a burnished orange and gold tail, a well-developed torso, long ash blond hair, and green eyes. He is strong and a protector of the colony, and was the acting Crown after Brom&#x27;s death for the years prior to Raenafel&#x27;s return. Hyfus was the original soul-mate to Tilaweed with whom he recognised. He is the father to Illora, a Child of Recognition, who was stolen from the WaveDancers.
* Inkbottom is the half brother to Sleia, and his parents are Shoseabee and Kadva. He is a squirt with large pointy ears and big blue eyes, and is a leader rather than follower. Inkbottom is occasionally led astray by Shoresprout, but he is a sensitive little elf with potentially good telepathic abilities which would have emerged in subsequent series. He tends to err on the side of caution. Inkbottom gets his name from the birthmark in the shape of an octopus on his buttock.
* Illora is a Child of Recognition who was stolen when she was a small child. She is the daughter of Tilaweed and Hyfus, and has a small pixieish face with long ears in her true form, and is quite distorted and grotesque in her altered form. She wears a head covering of polished coral to cover a bald head and has aqua-marine eyes. Illora was brought up with Shardon under Sydor&#x27;s cruel hand, but she shares a love of music with her mother.
* Irralee: A young elf on the brink of fertility and sexuality, Irralee has long port wine coloured hair and one amber eye and one green eye. She sometimes stands alone from the rest of the WaveDancers, but is very giving and generous. She holds an adoration for Sydor and recognises a special quality within him that is attractive to her, but that she can&#x27;t seem to pinpoint.
* Jormak is slightly taller than his younger brother Barmek. He has long coal-black hair that is tightly drawn back and threaded through seashells giving it the appearance of a long braid. His eyes are a deep golden-brown and quite piercing. Jormak has a strong and powerful physique which he maintains through disciplined sporting activities. He tends to be self-absorbed and has complete disregard for the values and feelings of others. He is very much into the physical, not given to contemplation or development of his inner resources. He is the lead hunter with a fascination for inventing weapons for defence and conquest. He is cunning and shrewd and can be manipulative at times, and certainly not be laughed at for it would raise his wrath. With dark rugged looks and an intense sexual aggression, he is popular with many of the WaveDancers. His sire is Rhialdor, and his mother is Kirith.
* Kadva is one of the Storytellers in the WaveDancer colony and is a traditionalist. He is the life-mate of Shoseabee and father of Inkbottom. He wears a brown loin cloth and seaweed bindings on his calves and forearms. He has black and brown hair that rises to a point at each side of his head near his pointed ears. Kadva has marine blue eyes.
* Kirith is slightly smaller and rounder than the average WaveDancer. She has long hair bundled up for practical purposes into a hair net, and her tail is green. Her skin is the colour of pearls and she has huge brown eyes. She possess the wisdom and teaching of the dolphins behind her and shares a special relationship with them. Though she is a third generation WaveDancer, she is one of the elders. She is also known as the &quot;birthing mother&quot; by the others as she is the midwife to the colony. Kirith can be spirited and frisky, but is also responsible: she was entrusted by Brom to look after and educate Raenafel which she achieved with the utmost care and secrecy. Rhialdor is Kirith&#x27;s lifemate, and she is the mother of Jormak and Barmek.
* Korillia is quite tall for a WaveDancer, about 6 feet including her tentacles. In some ways she is a freak in the colony because of her hybrid form: half WaveDancer and half octopus (she is the victim of a patch of bad magic when her mother was pregnant with her). Korillia has a mop of red curly hair and violet eyes. Her tail is crimson with pink/purple suckers. Her tentacles have given her a purpose in the colony: she is the cook and has a special talent for turning anything in the ocean into foodstuff for the elves (except for octos with which she has an affinity). Korillia is quite temperamental and is a perfectionist. She has been known to cry into her cooking shells at times when she doesn&#x27;t get her way. Korillia is a second born, but is barren. The squirts in the colony like to tease and play tricks on her.
* Lazik has brown hair and large blue eyes, and is one of the storytellers in the WaveDancer community. He is a naive elf with good intentions, so he is easily influenced by Sydor. Lazik is good with undersea plants and can often be found tending gardens of seaweed. He uses these plants for medicinal purposes and also supplies Rhialdor with appropriate weed which can be dried out and used for making garments. Lazik and Shoseabee are Slea&#x27;s parents.
* Maron is one of the fourth generation elves, and is slight in build but quite sporty and adventurous. He has his white/grey hair tied in braids, and has distinct black eyebrows and large blue eyes. He is adventurous of spirit, and is the partner of Paffa. Maron is the head storyteller in the WaveDancer community, and also the sire of Zadori.
* Paffa has black crimpy hair with a white streak down the middle, brown eyes and a very masculine jawline and thick neck. He has the physique of an athlete, and is an excellent hunter. Paffa is the brother of Irralee and is very protective of her as well as Maron, his partner. He has a good sense of humour, loves life and food. He is also a forward thinker and a risk taker if it is in the best interests of the WaveDancer community.
* Raenafel is a fourth generation WaveDancer and is destined to be the fourth Crown by her birthright. Brom and Ailsa are Raenafel&#x27;s parents, and she was born a Child of Recognition. She stands taller than the average female WaveDancer, and can look most male elves in the eye. She has extremely long thick hair the colour of midnight, and her plush deep purple eyes are doe-like in appearance. In contrast to the other elves, Raenafel is a babe in the woods and knows nothing of the world except for what she learn from Brom&#x27;s, Kirith&#x27;s and No-Wing&#x27;s teachings when she was hidden away. Despite her naivety and her lack of socialisation, she has tremendous powers: healing and flesh-shaping. Raenafel is a natural leader and does not shirk at the threat of danger, and she takes her role as the next Crown very seriously.
* Rhialdor is the lifemate of Kirith and sire of Barmek and Jormak. He is a pacifist by nature, and takes on the role of clown or court jester within the community. He has long hair the colour of burnt umber tied up in a plait, and brown eyes and thick black eyebrows. He is a garment maker for the rest of the WaveDancers. Rhialdor is the lifemate of Kirith.
* Shoresprout is the rambunctious but adorable daughter of Burdekin and Zadori and a seventh generation WaveDancer. She has orange hair and lime green eyes, and wears a tunic to match. Her best friend is Inkbottom who is just a little younger than her, and she is definitely the leader of the two. She can be quite mischievous and spirited, and is not averse to getting into trouble. Shoresprout can also be quite dramatic, and loves the re-enactment of the WaveDancer history by the rest of the Storytellers.
* Shoseabee is quite an exotic elf with large almond shaped brown eyes, a snub nose and short golden hair. She is one of the Storytellers to the clan and loves to dance. She is easily influenced and doesn&#x27;t think things through, and is perhaps a trifle frivolous. Shoseabee has two lovemates and a child to each of them: Lazik, who is the father of Sleia and Kadva, who is the sire of Inkbottom. Shoseabee is a fourth generation WaveDancer.
* Sleia is the daughter of Lazik and Shoseabee, and half sister to Inkbottom. She has a well-toned body for a female elf and is shorter than the average WaveDancer. She has crystal blue eyes and light sandy-brown hair which she keeps braided. She has a square jaw, a broad nose and strong forehead. Sleia is not known as a pretty elf, but what she lacks in looks is made up tenfold in courage and personality. She can be wilful and cheeky, and is very nimble. She is Barmek&#x27;s best friend, and is loyal, honesty and trustworthy. Quiet and a little reserved around most of the others, she blossoms into a gregarious and delightful personality when she is adventuring with Barmek. She can be humorous, outgoing and talkative and is the more practical of the two. Sleia can move with great stealth, and is very comfortable with her body and her sporting prowess.
* Sydor (also known as Rydos, his name rearranged) is the High One, is very tall and gangly in appearance. He has cobalt blue eyes and his hair is frosted creme. He is silent and lethal in his actions, and is a dark character who has split inside himself. He lives in secrecy waiting patiently for the time when he can change all and sundry into their original forms and return to the skies in the palace. He mismanages his magic, and uses his flesh-shaping abilities to inflict pain on the innocent even though he is convinced that he is doing the right thing. Sydor also has the ability to black send and to create a bubble around him that refracts light and therefore appears invisible under water.
* Tentus is the only first generation elf still alive in the WaveDancer colony, and possesses the ability of rock/coral shaping. He is the younger brother of Neama, and the child of Ausra and Desh. He is medium in height and has a receding hairline of white hair, bushy eyebrows and his skin has a jaundiced look to it as if it has been stretched over bone. His most prominent features are his grey eyes that look as if they have cataracts. He is somewhat eccentric, a little cranky and impatient because all he wants is to be left alone. His function is the colony is that of historian and he sculpts coral statues of the ancestors and their stories in the Chamber of Remembrance. Tentus is a strong sender and receiver. When the threat of the Soul Stealer is upon them, he can sense it through nightmares which leave him drained, sick and helpless.
* Tilaweed is one of the oldest mer-elves in the WaveDancer colony. She is about 5 foot 10 inches with her tail. She carries herself with dignity as if she is of royal birth, but this is a natural quality rather than a false persona. She has long golden blonde hair and large ice blue eyes, and wears a girdle and head-dress of pearls and shells. Her tail is a green blue with some pink through her fin. She possesses many great talents. She is a musician: she has a beautiful lyrical voice that can soothe the soul and lull the mind, but she rarely chooses to sing because she mourns for her lost Child of Recognition. Tilaweed is estranged from her soul-mate Hyfus. She is a loner and tends to be secretive, but her glamorous facade hides her sensitivity and pain. Tilaweed spends her time equally above and below water though she can never venture on land because of her tail.
* Zadori is the mother of Shoresprout and the lovemate of Burdekin. She is also the daughter of Maron and is a sixth generation WaveDancer. Even though she is quite young, she is a traditionalist not given to forward thinking. Zadori is long, sleek and sensuous, and has silver white hair and blue eyes. She is also one of the Storytellers in the community.

==Elves of other or unknown tribes==
* Ekuar (male, rockshaper): Part of an ancient group of elves (probably of the second generation), he was captured by trolls and used for his rockshaping skills, with dismemberment serving as punishment for disobedience; thus he lacks an arm, a leg, and several fingers. He is a mentor, adviser and father figure to Rayek.
* Mekda (female, rockshaper, deceased): Part of an ancient group of elves (second generation or thereabouts), she was captured by trolls and used for her rockshaping skills, with dismemberment serving as punishment for disobedience. After several centuries, she became little more than a mindless tool, named Sack-o&#x27;-Bones. She is finally employed by Guttlekraw to force his way into the Go-Back&#x27;s lodge and strike at their children; she was afterwards found by Ekuar, dead from cold exposure.
* Osek (male, rockshaper, deceased): Part of an ancient group of elves (second generation or thereabouts), he was captured by trolls and used for his rockshaping skills, but managed to escape into the desert surrounding Sorrow&#x27;s End. His final act was shaping a niche in a sheer cliff wall, to crawl in and die. This niche was later found by Suntop through his magic sense.
* Teir (male, of Go-Back, Wolfrider, and Glider descent): Teir is an elf with prodigious skills in animal bonding. He is lifemated to the new Wolfrider chief Ember, after a long, difficult competition with her lovemate Mender and although the couple has since Recognized, they have chosen to postpone having a child until they feel they are ready. His appearance is similar to the famed meeting of Chieftess Huntress Skyfire and her lifemate Dreamsinger, who they both physically resemble in kind. It was recently revealed that Teir is, in fact, the son of deceased Go-Back chieftess Kahvi and her lovemate Tyldak&#x27;s son, Windkin, whom she had asked to sire a child on her after the death of his father; this, in effect, makes Teir grandson to Dewshine, great-grandson to Treestump, and second and third cousin to Cutter and twins Ember and Sunstream, respectively. He has long black hair with many braids and feathers, and gray eyes.

==Half troll, half elf==
* Two-Edge: Son of Winnowill, an elf, and Smelt, a troll, he became a master blacksmith, but is mentally crippled by his abused childhood at the hands of his mother. He had an unusual interest, possibly romantic, in Venka, Rayek&#x27;s daughter, referring to her as his &quot;maiden&quot;. Though he heavily resembles a troll with broad, heavy features, he is more muscular than his pure counterparts, and bears no warts or rounded nose. He is unusually dextrous for a troll, and was the forger of the infamous New Moon, Cutter&#x27;s sword. He has pointed ears and the ability to send, a gift awakened by Leetah previous to events of &quot;The Siege of Blue Mountain&quot;, in an attempt to heal his madness. He recently became lovemates with Ahdri, who is helping him explore his elfin side. He has white-gray hair.

==High Ones==
At least eight High Ones survived the primitive humans&#x27; slaughter after their Palace crashed on the World of Two Moons:
* Aerth: A lovemate of Timmain, a healer and possible ancestor of Leetah, he helped raise Timmorn alongside Sefra. With auburn hair and green eyes, he was the Circle of the Nine&#x27;s Ears, deciding why they would go.
* Deir: Lifemate of Gibra and father of Vol, he offered to accompany Gibra on her quest to find Haken, but she rejected this offer and left him with the other High Ones. He had short red hair.
* Gibra: Mother of Vol, her son with Deir, her lifemate, she was the Caution in the Circle of the Nine, holding them back. She had blonde hair and blue eyes. She went after Haken after his banishment, hoping baby Vol would turn his heart to good. Although Vol has a similar name to Lord Voll of the Gliders, Richard Pini has stated that they are not the same elf.
* Haken: Timmain&#x27;s nemesis and a possible ancestor of Winnowill or Rayek, he wanted to conquer the humans. He was Gibra&#x27;s opposite, Passion, pushing them forward. He regained use of powerful magic in a fairly short time after the crash, displaying the ability levitate, shape, and transmute matter, as well as shapeshifting himself. He was mutilated and banished by Timmain. It is not known what became of him. He had black hair, dark skin, and yellow eyes.
* Kalil: A possible lovemate of Kaslen, with brown hair and eyes, he appears as a gentler tempered version of Strongbow. He refuses to sing with the rest of the Circle after they crash, but agrees to keep time by beating out rhythm.
* Kaslen: A female treeshaper, possible lovemate of Kalil, it was her broken arm that started the conflict between Timmain and Haken. She is possible ancestor of Redlance, and has long red-orange and green eyes.
* Sefra: A female Timekeeper of the Circle of the Nine, and close friend of Timmain&#x27;s. Sefra is the first stargazer, and a probable ancestor of Skywise and Shale. She has silver hair and eyes. 
* Timmain: With Aerth, mother of an unnamed daughter, and with an unnamed wolf the mother of Timmorn Yellow-Eyes, with Skywise the mother of Jink, Timmain was the only High One to learn to adapt to the world, and mother of the Wolfriders. She is the last surviving High One, after spending millennia in wolf form, and is now Recognized and lifemated to Skywise. 

In addition, the names of several of the slain High Ones are known:
* Adya: A close friend of Timmain, he was the first to try to make contact with the humans, and the first to be killed. He had blond hair and blue eyes. He was their Eyes, seeing where the Circle of the Nine would go. Timmain stated that if she had chosen a lifemate, he would have been hers.
* Guin was killed during the humans&#x27; first assault, and is a close friend of Haken&#x27;s.
* Ima was killed during the humans&#x27; first assault.
* Orolin tended the Scroll of Colors within the Palace, and was wrapped in a Preserver cocoon. According to Timmain, his Preserver cocoon ripped during the crash, and he eventually died without ever waking.
* Tislin was killed during the humans&#x27; first assault.

Even more elves, such as Rellah, Enlet, Almeck, Nefahrin, Menolan, Seeree, Oraynah, Marreck, and Jennah are mentioned in the non-canonical &quot;Blood Of Ten Chiefs&quot; collaboration novels, edited by Richard Pini.

==Preserver==
Preservers are mentioned by the original High Ones to be the descendants of some sort of goodnatured insect or bug-like creature, that evolved for the better with their influence. They are immortal and cannot reproduce, but seem to be entirely indestructible except for their colorful wings. They are famed for their inherent ability to produce &quot;wrapstuff&quot;, a weblike material that renders those completely cocooned into a timeless sleep state until the webbing is torn.
* Petalwing is a notoriously poor singer, and by virtue of its (preservers don&#x27;t have a gender) big mouth, their de facto leader. It follows the &quot;highthings&quot; in order to protect them, since they refuse its constant offerings to be put into safe &quot;wrapstuff&quot;. Petalwing was the only Preserver to stay on the World of Two Moons when the Palace departed, preferring to do so to take care of the Wolfriders.
* Tittersweet
* Berrybuzz
* Bitterscreech
* Willowsnap
* Littlesky
* Bumbleclaw
* Tickletoe
* No-Wing was the only preserver mentioned as having gone with the forebears of the Wavedancers in the original, now non-canonical &quot;Wavedancers&quot; series. It accompanied Raenafel on her journey to the Palace and placed her in wrapstuff when she became too weak from dehydration to continue. It stood guard over her until she was found by Sleia and Barmek, then placed Barmek in wrapstuff when he was injured. No-Wing was primary companion of the old rock-shaper Tentus.

== Trolls ==
Trolls are immortal, brought by the original High Ones as &#x27;pets&#x27;. Their evolution was not a pleasant one, and they became ape-like, childish creature with a penchant for cruelty. It is the fault of Trolls that the Palace crashed. Their descendants are much larger and more intelligent, the latter by barely.

===Greymung&#x27;s Trolls (Holt Trolls)===
* Greymung was king of the Holt Trolls after refusing to leave at the command of Guttlekraw, rebelling and driving him and his followers away. He was killed when Guttlekraw&#x27;s force returned in force years later. Greymung was the facilitator of the &quot;Original Quest&quot; when he tricked Cutter and his Wolfriders into the desert in the hopes of killing them once and for all.
* Old Maggoty is the oldest known Troll, knowledgeable in herbal lore, Oddbit&#x27;s granny and great granny of Trinket. She is rumored to be an old concubine of Guttlekraw when she was young. She is much more levelheaded than her fellow female Trolls, and interacts well with elves. She was one of a handful of trolls to accompany the elves in the Palace when it departed the World of Two Moons.
* Oddbit: A maiden who is an opportunist of considerable enterprise, and the love interest of Picknose, she has been a concubine of both Greymung and Guttlekraw. Assumed mother of Trinket and many others, she has shown pity to elve&#x27;s &quot;stupidity&quot; and &quot;ugliness&quot; on more than one occasion. She is extraordinarily self-centered, even for a Troll and is highly promiscuous. She has curly blonde hair.
* Picknose: A soldier of the Holt Trolls, he was one of the few to escape when the colony was invaded. He was told of a treasure trove to which a key in the hilt of Cutter&#x27;s sword provided access. After failing to gain the key, he and his companions went up north anyway to find the treasure and were caught and enslaved in the attempt. When the Wolfriders and Go-Backs invaded the tunnels of Guttlekraw&#x27;s realm, they freed Picknose and the other Holt Trolls and formed an alliance that overthrew Guttlekraw and established Picknose as King. He lost the throne while gambling and hooked up with the Wolfriders who eventually allowed him to establish a colony of his own. According to the Pinis, his name comes not from any unsavory habit but from the fact that his nose resembles a pickaxe.
* Scurff (also known as Scurfball) is a King Greymung&#x27;s doorkeeper. He tried to prevent the Wolfriders from entering the caverns when the Holt was burned down, but was &quot;persuaded&quot; to let them in by Cutter.
* Trinket is a daughter of Oddbit and Picknose. She has a strange liking for elves, especially Mender, whom she has a huge crush on. She was taken by Rayek in the palace. As a result, even though she is the first-born daughter, all of her siblings and subsequent descendants are significantly older than her. She accompanied Jink and Yun when they went in search of Skywise during &quot;Stargazer&#x27;s Quest&quot; and, after meeting a group of trolls on another planet, she decided to stay with them when they invited her to.

===Guttlekraw&#x27;s Trolls===
* King Guttlekraw: An ancient King of the Trolls of Frozen Mountain, he had a fanatical hatred for Elves, possibly encouraged by Two-Edge. This hate extended to keeping rockshaping elves in brutal slavery and worked to permanently seal the Palace of the High Ones from all access. He wears a crown of elf fingers taken from captives, and it is hinted that he has eaten elf flesh. He was going to torture the Go-Back, Vaya, for the elves&#x27; secrets, but she made an attempt on his life and was executed. He was defeated and killed at the hands of the Go-Backs, Wolfriders and the Holt Trolls, and was devoured by their wolf companions.
* Itchback is a young, overconfident Troll warrior. When the Wolfriders and Go-Backs invade Guttlekraw&#x27;s realm, he brashly attacks them and is killed before he can lay his hands on them.

===Picknose&#x27;s Trolls===
* Drub is one of Picknose and Oddbit&#x27;s daughters, and sister to Flam, with whom she is implied to have an incestuous relationship. She accompanied Cutter&#x27;s group of elves during the &quot;Shards&quot; series.
* Flam is one of Picknose and Oddbit&#x27;s sons, and brother to Drub, with whom he is implied to have an incestuous relationship. He accompanied Cutter&#x27;s group of elves during the &quot;Shards&quot; series. He is best friends with Mender, chiefly due to their common temperament.
* Mungwart is one of Picknose and Oddbit&#x27;s sons. He is killed along with two unnamed Trolls while defending his home from Grohmul Djun&#x27;s men.

===Other Trolls===
* Unnamed Firstcomer Troll: Cutter and Two-Edge discovered that one of the last of the trolls that caused the Palace of the High Ones to crash land on the World of Two Moons thousands of years ago was still alive and had been reluctantly crowned king by trolls who formerly served Guttlekraw and Picknose. When the elves found him, it was Leetah who realized that the troll was in very poor health and was dying. When the troll stated that his wish was to go back to the elves and trolls&#x27; homeworld, he was invited to come to the Palace and be welcomed by elves and trolls alike. He was nursed back to health by Leetah and Old Maggoty, then welcomed into the Palace by Timmain. With a handful of trolls, including Old Maggoty, his wish to go back to his homeworld was granted.

==Humans==
===Stone Age===
This list includes the original series, &quot;Blood of Ten Chiefs&quot;, &quot;Wolfrider&quot;, and some short stories.
* Adar is Nonna&#x27;s husband and a member of Olbar&#x27;s tribe. Banished for taking a wife from another tribe, he later returned and persuaded Olbar to take them back with a little help from the &quot;spirits&quot; Cutter and Skywise. He is loosely based on Richard Pini.
* Aro is a survivor from the fire set in the &quot;Green Growing Place&quot; who happened upon Sorrows End in a desperate bid for food and water along with his son, wife and brother.
* Azak
* Bakta
* Bone Woman is a shaman to Olbar&#x27;s tribe who used bones for scrying. She was eventually cast out for her plotting against Nonna and Adar and the Elves.
* Bruga (male)
* Buruk: While out in the woods one day Buruk, out of jealousy and hatred, attacked fellow hunter Krat and left him for dead, but Krat slowly crawled back to the village and, according to Buruk, lived long enough to condemn him. He was sentenced to burn at the stake, but the fire burned through his ropes and he ran, still on fire, into the woods. He was left hideously scarred by the flames and began hunting his fellow villagers out of revenge. He also decided to hunt the elves too, spending years studying them by disguising himself with wolf musk to hide his scent. In this way, he not only learned the elves&#x27; language but also their ways of hunting, skills he used to kidnap Redpelt, one of the tribe&#x27;s cubs, with the intent of torturing him. Redpelt, and thus Buruk, was tracked down by the elf Finder, who killed the human both in self-defense and to keep him from killing Redpelt.
* Chiad G&#x27;cho is a Hoan G&#x27;Tay Tribe member who went on a secret war with part of the tribe to attack the &quot;Wolf Demons&quot; and helped set fire to the Forbidden Grove. He was captured due to the arrival of Dart&#x27;s Jack Wolf Riders. He returned to his tribe but was killed by Kureel.
* Demontricker is Mantricker&#x27;s opposite among Gotara&#x27;s Chosen, but, eventually, the elf&#x27;s ally when it came to preventing all-out war between their people. Ironically, hundreds of years later, tales of his exploits would be used by shamans to encourage those of Gotara&#x27;s Chosen to destroy the &quot;demons&quot;.
* Dreeka (male)
* Dro is Aro&#x27;s brother who went mad following the fire at the Green Growing Place. He died of an apparent heart attack following a confrontation with the elves.
* Ehok is a twin brother of Taf. Both boys considered themselves as Demontricker&#x27;s heirs, naive to the fatal repercussions of their actions. They ultimately became responsible for the deaths of Skywise&#x27;s parents, causing their tribe&#x27;s shaman to sacrifice Taf, a price for overconfidence which Ehok would regret for the rest of his life.
* Elona is a girl who lived during Goodtree&#x27;s reign, and had a major crush on Mantricker. She later became Demontricker&#x27;s wife.
* Geoki is a juvenile member of the Hoan G&#x27;Tay Sho, Nonna&#x27;s tribe. He befriends Dart without any prejudice. Both are nearly killed by Kureel and healed by Leetah&#x27;s efforts.
* Geru (from Olbar&#x27;s tribe)
* Graysha (female, Olbar&#x27;s mate)
* Graz (male)
* Kakuk is a Hoan G&#x27;Tay Tribesman who went into blue mountain as an offering to the spirits. There he was a servant of Winnowill tasked with singing to her when she was troubled. After she took over Blue Mountain he was one of Winnowill&#x27;s prisoners.
* Kerthan (male, lived during Twospear&#x27;s time)
* Klaa (male)
* Kloni (female)
* Kohahn (male, Hoan G&#x27;Tay Sho)
* Krat: Very little is known about Krat, except he was one of his village&#x27;s best hunters. While out hunting one day, he was attacked and left for dead by fellow hunter Buruk. Despite his fatal injuries, Krat managed to crawl back to his village and was barely able to name Buruk as his attacker before succumbing to his wounds.
* Kron (male, lived during Goodtree&#x27;s time)
* Malak: A young man of Olbar&#x27;s tribe who failed his trial of manhood and eloped with Olbar&#x27;s daughter Selah. Olbar and his men pursued them into the Forbidden Grove, but were driven back by Petalwing&#x27;s band of Preservers. The young lovers thanked the friendly &quot;spirits&quot;, which then wrapped them in suspended animation cocoons while they slept. About a year later they were discovered by Cutter, who made good his name by cutting them out, and they left to find a new home.
* Marn is Skar/Sohan&#x27;s father. Having always hated the elves, when his son Sohan was taken and left scarred by Mantricker, Marn passed that hatred onto his son. Convincing the boy that his scar was a sign from Gotara to destroy all elves, Marn taught his son all the skills he felt would be needed to kill the &quot;demons&quot;. Sometime later, Marn died of a heart attack, leaving his son an orphan and an outcast in the village who had to raise himself when no other family would take him in.
* Morri is Skar&#x27;s wife. Despite his anger and fearful appearance, she fell in love with him, and he with her, when she became the only person capable of calming down his rages. They married and a short time later she gave birth to his son. Some years later, Morri was bitten by an animal infected with foaming sickness (rabies). When she herself died of the disease, it reignited Skar&#x27;s rage against the elves after he convinced himself they were the ones who sent the rabid animal to kill Morri.
* Nima is one of Nonna&#x27;s and Adar&#x27;s adopted children.
* Nonna is a human artist from the Hoan G&#x27;Tay Sho tribe who was the first human whom the Wolfriders found was sympathetic to them. She lives with her husband, Adar, who is commemorated in the Wolfriders&#x27; Howls, and are the only humans so honoured. She is loosely based on Wendy Pini herself.
* Olbar the Mountain-Tall is a leader of a village of Humans renowned for his great size, and one of the first in his tribe to respect the Elves as equals. He is first seen in the Elfquest sidebar story &quot;Homespun&quot; in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot;.
* Little Patch is a human adopted by Tyleet as a baby after his parents had abandoned him in the wild because of a large red birthmark on his face, which also gave him his name. He became the first human to live among the Wolfriders, but later left them and rejoined his parents&#x27; tribe, eventually becoming their chief. Just before his death of old age, he returns to the Wolfriders&#x27; holt and dies in Tyleet&#x27;s arms.
* Riven Fire-Mouth (later God-Talker) is a female Shaman of the tribe that later became the Hoan G&#x27;Tay Sho, and is the first human to make contact with the Gliders of Blue Mountain.
* Rovin (male)
* Selah is Olbar&#x27;s daughter and a lover of Malak. Rumor has it that Malak and Selah were based on a couple the Pinis knew.
* Shan is Skar&#x27;s son, and was orphaned when his mother died of foaming sickness and his father committed suicide. Like his father, Shan had no other relatives to take him in. Because he felt sorry for the boy and he did not want history to repeat itself, Demontricker took Shan in and raised him as his son, teaching him to respect the &quot;demons&quot; and to encourage peace between the village and elves. By the time Shan became a village elder, his foster father&#x27;s exploits had become legendary, so he would often regale the village children with tales of Demontricker, along with lessons of living in peace with the &quot;demons&quot;.
* Sohan/Skar: As a child, he was held hostage by Mantricker and left physically and emotionally scarred by the encounter, resulting in a lifelong obsession to destroy the &quot;demons&quot;. This obsession made him an outcast in the village, although he married and fathered a son. After his wife died of the foaming sickness, he held Demontricker&#x27;s own wife hostage to force him to find Mantricker and pass along Skar&#x27;s challenge. As Mantricker died years before, he ended up fighting Bearclaw instead. When Skar lost the fight, he felt that with his vengeance gone he had nothing left to live for and took his own life.
* Spirit Man is a shaman for Gotara&#x27;s Chosen. In his religious fanaticism, he set the Holt ablaze in retaliation for a previous battle with the Wolfrider and was killed for it.
* Tabak is the Spirit Man&#x27;s apprentice, and was killed by Cutter to prevent him from sacrificing Redlance. His death led to the destruction of the Holt.
* Taf is a twin brother of Ehok. Both boys considered themselves as Demontricker&#x27;s heirs, naive to the fatal repercussions of their actions. They ultimately became responsible for the deaths of Skywise&#x27;s parents, causing their tribe&#x27;s shaman to sacrifice Taf.
* Tenchi is one of Nonna&#x27;s and Adar&#x27;s adopted children.
* Thaya
* Thief: A man whose original name was stripped from him by his brother Olbar as punishment for some serious crime. He conspired with Bone Woman to murder Cutter and Skywise for the lodestone. After he claimed a new name - Spiritslayer - he was killed by Cutter.
* Tolf the Wood-Cleaver is Adar&#x27;s father.

* Atvon Grang (male)

* Broden&#x27;Hull (male)
* Donmahr (male)
* Grennetch (male)
* Grohmul Djun is an overlord of the known World of Two Moons who sought to conquer Abode. He greatly desired Lady Venovel (Winnowill), but found himself unable to touch her. He also desired Venka, but was thwarted and betrayed by the infatuated half troll Two-Edge, also his master builder. His empire crumbled when the Elves regained their palace (as recorded in the &quot;Shards&quot; series) and, in exile, he is later killed by his own son Angrif.
* Karkapetch (male)
* Ladlopp (male)
* Padki is Woodcutter&#x27;s and Bolli&#x27;s child, and was saved by Tyleet when he was threatened by a rat that nearly crawled into his crib.
* Rulnk (male)
* Shuna is rebel fighter and daughter of one of the Djun&#x27;s best men, inspired at a young age by Leetah, who healed her of a terrible disease when she was small. She became a trusted ally of the elves when she helped then regain the palace shards and saved Strongbow&#x27;s life by allowing him to shoot a rope arrow through her hand while he was falling. She is later adopted by Cutter and Leetah after the deaths of her human parents. She was later married first to the abusive Nunkah, then her friend Bee. She became a &quot;bridge&quot; between humans and elves, teaching each side how to respect the other. She was later known as Shaman Shuna by the humans and had her life extended several times by Leetah, and became the first human to be able to send like the elves. In the &quot;Stargazer&#x27;s Quest&quot; storyline, it is explained that after several hundred years, Shuna decided she had lived long enough and asked the &quot;good spirits&quot; (most likely Leetah) to remove her immortality. Shuna then started aging again and lived out her life, dying of natural causes.
* Shuna&#x27;s Father is a brutal and opportunistic mercenary in Grohmul Djun&#x27;s employ. He first attempted to use Leetha&#x27;s healing powers for his own gain, which was foiled by Leetah and Skywise. During the &quot;Shards&quot; storyline, he longed to become Saddle Chief, a military rank similar to cavalry captain. When Shuna spoiled his plan to use his next elven captive, Tyleet, for personal gain and subsequently fled his wrath, he beat his wife to death when he found out that she&#x27;d been secretly assisting her daughter. He was accidentally killed by Grohmul Djun during the decisive uprising of Djun&#x27;s resentful subjects.
* Tomloch (male)
* Vort&#x27;Chust (male)

* Lady Venovel is Winnowill&#x27;s human disguise.

* Abtrag
* Anamara (female; Longrider)
* Androw is one of Lehrigen&#x27;s men on the hunt for Ember&#x27;s elves, approximately 19–20 years old with a black braid. He was seduced by the elf Dewshine, who summarily hung him upside down without his clothes as a warning to the humans.
* Angrif Djun is the only son of Grohmul Djun, and valued somewhat for it. Despite his penchant for arrogancy, it is his gender that often saves him from his father&#x27;s own sword or fist. Despite his tongue, he values his father&#x27;s opinion and steals from the Wild Hunt in order to bring back a prize. This leads to his sister Gifa&#x27;s journey to the Wild Hunt, to which he very much opposes. In retaliation, he orders her to be ambushed by his own men, beaten and abandoned, to make the infiltration more &quot;realistic&quot;. He later kills Gifa to spur the humans against the elves. Soon afterwards he also murders his father. As he got older, he amassed a large army and set about conquering the World of Two Moons, as well as tracking down and killing his father&#x27;s illegitimate offspring. As he entered the mountains, he heard rumors about the elves living there and infiltrated their holt to kill them once and for all. In the ensuing battle he lost both of his sons and was castrated by Krim shortly before she died. In retaliation, he spent the remaining years of his life (as well as a lot of money and resources) overlooking the building of a large fleet of warships. He lived just long enough to witness the completion of the ships. His skull now adorns the ship that is the head of the fleet.

Due to an illness, his life was extended by Mender, enabling him to be able to live longer than most humans. In effect, this has made him more like his adopted family than the humans he was born to.
* Khuldalchi (male)
* Korik (male)
* Krois (male)
* Lehrigen is a professional elf hunter who claimed to have killed elves all across Abode, including the Go-Back chief Kahvi. Her death has since been confirmed.

He was one of few humans that spoke elvish and called them &#x27;elves&#x27;. He kidnapped Dewshine and Pool in order to trade them for the healer Mender.

Ardan was captured and tortured by Angrif&#x27;s men, which drove him further into madness. When Angrif felt he learned all he needed to know about the &quot;demons&quot;, he shot and killed his half-brother using a pistol Ardan had stolen to further his claim.
* Bran Porak (male)
* Ellia is the first wife of Ardan Djarum. She was familiar with the streets folklore and the legends born around her husband&#x27;s supposed ancestor, Grohmul Djun.

* Djarum junior is the son of Ardan Djarum and a &quot;loveless wife&quot; he married some time after Ellia. A man in his thirties or forties, he shared his father&#x27;s intense hatred of elves. He was killed by Surge.

==Monster==
* Madcoil is a murderous monster accidentally created when a wildcat and a large snake, locked in mortal combat, disturbed a pool of decayed magic that was also hit with lightning at that exact moment. That combination of elements created the monster with a senseless lust for murder using its massive size, claws and psionic powers to confuse its prey to its advantage. It attacked both the human colonies and the Wolfriders, causing numerous deaths before it was defeated and killed by the elves under Cutter&#x27;s leadership. Regardless, the humans accused the elves of deliberately creating the creature to bedevil them. It was later revealed that the mutual hatred between Bearclaw and a human chief had partially reawakened the spell and fueled the monster&#x27;s rage.

<text>The M224 60 mm Lightweight Company Mortar System (LWCMS) is a smoothbore, muzzle-loading, high-angle-of-fire mortar used for close-in support of ground troops. It was deployed extensively in the War in Afghanistan by the United States military.

==Description==
The M224 system is composed of these parts:

* M225 Cannon: 
* M170 Bipod: 
* M7A1 Baseplate for use in conventional mode: or
** M8 baseplate for use in handheld mode: 
* M64A1 Sight Unit (The M67 Sight Unit is now widely used for the system): 

The mount consists of a bipod and a base plate, which is provided with screw-type elevating and traversing mechanisms to elevate/traverse the mortar. The M64A1 sight unit is attached to the bipod mount. The mortar can be fired in the conventional mode or the handheld mode. This smoothbore system can be gravity-fired or fired by using a manual spring-loaded trigger.

It is typically fielded at the infantry company level. A small mortar section with two mortars was organic to Army rifle companies (light, airborne, air assault) and Ranger companies. Marine rifle companies have a section with three 60 mm mortars in the company weapons platoon.

==History==
The M224 LWCMS (Lightweight Company Mortar System) replaced the older (WWII-era) 60 mm M2 mortar and the inaccurate M19 Mortar and began fielding as prototypes in the mid-1970s during the Vietnam War. The M2s and M19s had an effective range of only . While the M224s were designed to fire all types of the older ammunition, their primary rounds are of the newer, longer-range type that range out to .

In 2011, an improved M224A1 version was brought into service. The M224A1 consists of the M225A1 tube, M170A1 bipod assembly, M7A1 baseplate, M8 auxiliary baseplate and the M64A1 sight unit. By reducing the number of components and using lighter materials, the M224A1 mortar system weighs at about 37.5 lbs (17 kg), which is 20% less with a reduction of compared to the original M224. The US Army plans to replace all legacy M224s with the new M224A1. Concurrently, a lighter version of the 81 mm M252 mortar was also developed.

==Ammunition==
The M224 Mortar can fire the following principal classifications of training and service ammunition:
* High explosive (HE): Designations M888, M720, and M720A1. Used against personnel and light material targets. The M888 HE shell has 0.79 lb (0.36 kg) of Composition B explosive filler.
** M1061: Improved HE with insensitive munitions performance-enhancing fragmentation warhead.
* Smoke Cartridge (WP): Designation M722. Used as a screening, signaling, or marking munition.
* Illumination (ILLUM): Used in night missions requiring illumination for assistance in observation.
* Training practice (TP): Designation M50A2/A3. Used for training in limited areas. These rounds are obsolete and no longer used.
* Red Phosphorus: Can not be fired by the 60 mm mortar
* Full Range Practice Cartridges (FRPC): Designation M769. This round is used for practice or clearing misfires.
* M1061 MAPAM: SAAB Technologies produced Multi-Purpose Anti-Personnel Anti-Material round.

===Fuzes===
The M224 rounds have three fuze types: The Multioption Fuze (M734), the Point-Detonating Fuze (M525), and Timer fuze. The M734 is used for the M720 HE round and can be set to function as proximity burst, near-surface burst, impact burst, or delay burst.

<doc id="613071" wikidata="Q883831" url="?curid=613071" title="Blenheim, New Zealand">
<text>Blenheim ( ; ) is the most populous town in the region of Marlborough, in the north east of the South Island of New Zealand. It has an estimated urban population of The surrounding Marlborough wine region is well known as the centre of the New Zealand wine industry. It enjoys one of New Zealand&#x27;s sunniest climates, with warm, relatively dry summers and cool, crisp winters.

Blenheim is named after the Battle of Blenheim (1704) in the War of the Spanish Succession, where troops led by John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough defeated a combined French and Bavarian force. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;flax stream&quot; for the town&#x27;s Māori name, .

==History==
The sheltered coastal bays of Marlborough supported a small Māori population possibly as early as the 12th century. Archaeological evidence dates Polynesian human remains uncovered at Wairau Bar to the 13th century. The rich sea and bird life of the area would easily have supported such small communities. As the Māori population of the area increased, they developed the land to sustain the growing population. In the early 1700s canals and waterways were dug among the natural river courses, allowing for the first forms of farming in the area including that of fish and native water fowl. A total of approximately 18 km of channels are known to have been excavated before the arrival of European settlers. Māori in the Marlborough Region also cultivated crops, including kūmara (sweet potato).

The area is also home to the first serious clash of arms between Māori and the British settlers after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Wairau Affray which occurred in what is now the village of Tuamarina.

The settlement was originally known to Europeans as &quot;The Beaver&quot; or &quot;Beaverton&quot; due to its frequent flooding.

Although the early history of Marlborough was closely associated with the Nelson settlement, the people of Marlborough desired independence from Nelson. In 1859, nineteen years after the original Nelson settlement, the request of Marlborough settlers was granted, and Marlborough became a separate province. Although gold was discovered in the province in the early 1860s the resulting boom did not last, and while the gold rush helped to expand the region, it was the development of pastoralism which provided the greatest long-term benefits. Marlborough squatters developed huge sheep runs that dominated the countryside, rivalling Canterbury&#x27;s sheep stations in size and wealth.

==Geography==

Situated on the Wairau Plain, the town is mostly flat with only its southernmost fringe rising to the base of the Wither Hills. As the plain is surrounded by mountains on all but the eastern flank, which is open to Cook Strait, it is relatively well protected from the frequent southerly weather fronts occurring during winters. The area does however experience some high wind events during the course of the year, especially from the west where the wind is funnelled down the Wairau Valley directly at the town. Open and exposed areas in and around Blenheim are also hit quite hard by winds blowing inland from Cook Strait. 
Blenheim sits at the confluence of the Taylor and Ōpaoa rivers. It is in a tectonically active zone and experiences several (usually small) earthquakes each year. The boundary between the Pacific plate (on which Blenheim sits) and the Indo-Australian plate passes just north of Blenheim. It lies east of Renwick, and just south of Spring Creek.

===Climate===
The climate is generally very settled, largely due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain ranges to the west which shelter Blenheim from the heaviest of rains that hit the western part of the South Island.

Summers are typically warm, dry and sunny. Winter mornings are cool and frosty. Snowfall is rare as the town is sheltered from cold southerly weather by the mountain ranges to the south. Rainfall and humidity is highest in winter and early spring, between June and October. The town&#x27;s average annual rainfall is a little more than 700mm, with 81.5 precipitation days.

Thunderstorms are an uncommon occurrence due to the sheltered climate. There is a higher likelihood in summer, when afternoon heating can generate a buildup of clouds above the ranges.

The highest recorded temperature is 37.8 °C, recorded on 7 February 1973. The lowest is −8.8 °C.

==Demographics==
The Blenheim urban area, as defined by Statistics New Zealand, covers and incorporates thirteen statistical areas. It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, the urban area had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, the Blenheim urban area had a population of 26,835 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,229 people (9.1%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 3,141 people (13.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 10,644 households, comprising 13,050 males and 13,776 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.95 males per female, with 4,674 people (17.4%) aged under 15 years, 4,461 (16.6%) aged 15 to 29, 11,526 (43.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 6,162 (23.0%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 85.3% European/Pākehā, 13.7% Māori, 3.9% Pasifika, 5.6% Asian, and 2.6% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 18.3, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 50.8% had no religion, 37.6% were Christian, 0.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.8% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.7% were Buddhist and 1.9% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 3,177 (14.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 5,022 (22.7%) people had no formal qualifications. 2,673 people (12.1%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 10,800 (48.7%) people were employed full-time, 3,258 (14.7%) were part-time, and 570 (2.6%) were unemployed.

==Economy==
The town&#x27;s economy is based on agricultural services, with pastoral and horticultural farming providing a major source of income. Historically, sheep farming, dairying, and wheat and barley were the major activities in the area. Marlborough&#x27;s first commercial grape vines were planted in 1973, and since then viticulture has become the dominant industry in the region; employment is derived not only from the production of wine, but also from &#x27;wine tourism&#x27; in the area. Olive growing has also gained some importance in recent years. Despite being located several kilometres inland, maritime industries are also important sources of employment for Blenheim. Lake Grassmere has New Zealand&#x27;s only salt works, producing 50% of the country&#x27;s total salt requirement. Fishing and mussel farming are also important in the region.

===Wine production===

Viticulture also has a very large impact on the local economy both directly, by way of employment and servicing required, and also by way of &#x27;wine tourism&#x27;. The local cellars attracted hundreds of thousands of domestic and international tourists every year. The area also hosts the annual Marlborough Wine &amp; Food Festival. The Marlborough wine region is now New Zealand&#x27;s largest, and receives worldwide recognition for its Sauvignon Blanc wines.

With its growing international critical recognition, much of the Marlborough wine industry has come to be dominated by large firms, owned by major New Zealand companies or offshore investors. There are over 50 vineyards near Blenheim. Agricultural land prices in the Wairau Valley increased dramatically in the 1990s and 2000s.

==Lifestyle==
The sunny, pleasant climate has long attracted people to the region, as holiday-makers or as permanent settlers. The region is especially popular among retired people, as well as people seeking an alternative lifestyle. Rapid population growth and other factors though have led to a contemporary chronic shortage of affordable housing for low and middle income earners.

The Marlborough Region has a wide range of predominantly outdoor leisure activities and the relaxed lifestyle and the flourishing wine and gourmet food industry in Marlborough are enjoyed by both locals and visitors alike.

==Events and points of interest==
Omaka Aerodrome, south of the town centre, is the setting for the two-yearly Classic Fighters Marlborough airshow. With a large emphasis on aircraft of World War One, it has been held since 2001.

Seymour Square and Pollard Park are two of the town centres main attractions for walks and general tourism. Seymour Square is an open public area in the centre, containing the War Memorial and Clock Tower, unveiled in 1928, classified as a &quot;Category I&quot; (&quot;places of &#x27;special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value&#x27;&quot;) historic place by Heritage New Zealand. The Square was named after Henry Seymour. Pollard Park is a large public park including children&#x27;s play areas, native shrubbery, rose gardens, a landscaped waterway, and is home to the Blenheim Golf Club and its 9-hole course, the Marlborough Tennis club and its courts, and Blenheim Croquet Club.
They are dry and arid ranges which have previously been the site of severe grass fires.

The GCSB Waihopai communications monitoring facility, part of the ECHELON network, is near Blenheim.

==Transport==

===Air===
Woodbourne Airport is a domestic airport and an RNZAF operational base. There are direct flights from Auckland and Wellington with Air New Zealand and from Wellington, Christchurch, and Paraparaumu with Sounds Air.

Omaka Aerodrome, to the south of the town centre, is used solely by private and vintage aircraft. The Classic Fighters airshow (based mainly on World War I and II aircraft) is held biennially at Easter.

===Road===
State Highway 1 runs through Blenheim and terminates at the junction of the two state highways. Blenheim is notable for a town of its size in that it does not have traffic lights at any intersection. Instead, roundabouts speed arterial traffic flow. Since the installation of roundabouts traffic volumes have quickly increased and upgrading options are being considered, e.g. traffic lights, longer two-lane approaches and even a bypass.

===Rail===
Blenheim is on the Main North Line, the northern part of the unofficially-named South Island Main Trunk Railway. The Coastal Pacific, a long-distance passenger train between Picton and Christchurch, stops at Blenheim railway station. The 1906 station has been listed NZHPT Category II since 1982. It is a standard Vintage station, with Tudor half-timbering and tile.

A major rail freight facility is north of Blenheim at Spring Creek.

The narrow-gauge Blenheim Riverside Railway runs through the town.

==Infrastructure and services==
===Electricity===
The Marlborough Electric Power Board (MEPB) was formed in October 1923 and established the Blenheim&#x27;s first public supply in April 1927, following the commissioning of the Waihopai hydroelectric power station 40 km southwest of Blenheim. Two diesel generators were commissioned at Springlands in 1930 and 1937 to supplement the supply from Waihopai. The town was connected to Cobb Power Station in 1945, which in turn was connected to the rest of the South Island grid in 1956. The diesel generators were relegated to standby duty, last generated power on 22 July 1992, and were decommissioned in 2003. The Energy Companies Act 1992 saw the MEPB corporatised and renamed Marlborough Electric. The 1998 electricity sector reforms required electricity companies to separate their lines and supply businesses. Marlborough Electric sold its generation and retailing business to Trustpower, with the remaining lines business renamed Marlborough Lines.

Today, Marlborough Lines owns and operates the electricity distribution network servicing the town, with electricity fed from Transpower&#x27;s national grid at its Blenheim substation in Springlands.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
Blenheim&#x27;s water supply is drawn from the Wairau aquifer via nine bores and is treated at two plants in Middle Renwick Road and Bomford Street.

==Education==
The first school opened in 1859. By 1875 there were three classes: Blenheim Upper Boys&#x27;, Blenheim Lower Boys&#x27;, and Blenheim Girls&#x27; and Infants&#x27;. Blenheim High School was formed within the school in 1879.

Catholic schools for boys and girls were established in 1872, replaced by St Mary&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School in 1886. In 1929 St Mary&#x27;s was rebuilt after a fire.

Marlborough High School, a coeducational secondary school, was founded in Blenheim in 1900. In 1919 it changed its name to Marlborough College. The intermediate section was split to form Bohally Intermediate in 1956. The college was split into separate boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; schools in 1963, with Marlborough Boys&#x27; College (MBC) retaining the existing site and Marlborough Girls&#x27; College (MGC) moving to a new site. An intention to relocate both Marlborough Boys&#x27; College and Marlborough Girls&#x27; College on the site currently occupied by MGC and Bohally Intermediate was announced in 2019, with Bohally Intermediate relocating to the current MBC site on Stephenson Street. The relocation plan was scrapped in 2024.

There are currently 11 schools in the Blenheim urban area: 
*Blenheim School is a state contributing primary (Year 1–6) primary school. It has a roll of approximately .

<text>The Robotics Institute (RI) is a division of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. A June 2014 article in &quot;Robotics Business Review&quot; magazine calls it &quot;the world&#x27;s best robotics research facility&quot; and a &quot;pacesetter in robotics research and education.&quot;

The Robotics Institute focuses on bringing robotics into everyday activities. Its faculty members and graduate students examine a variety of fields, including space robotics, medical robotics, industrial systems, computer vision and artificial intelligence, and they develop a broad array of robotics systems and capabilities.

Established in 1979 by Raj Reddy, the RI was the first robotics department at any U.S. university. In 1988, CMU became the first university in the world offering a Ph.D. in Robotics.

In 2012, the faculty, staff, students and postdocs numbered over 500, and the RI annual budget exceeded $65M, making the RI one of the largest robotics research organizations in the world.

The RI occupies facilities on the Carnegie Mellon main campus as well as in the Lawrenceville and Hazelwood neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, totaling almost 200,000 sq. ft of indoor space and 40 acres of outdoor test facilities.

==Major centers==
The National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC) was established in 1996 as the commercial arm of the RI, with the intention of applying robotic technology to commercial and defense applications. It has partnered with more than 300 companies such as General Motors, GE Ventures, Google and Apple, as well as with the U.S. military.

In September 2015, the NREC secured a $5.5 million gift from the car transport company, Uber, to support three robotics fellowships and research directed at developing safe, self-driving cars. This donation was made roughly seven months after Uber poached 40 NREC scientists, including its director, Tony Stenz, and other key program leaders, while the two organizations closely collaborated on driverless technologies.

The Field Robotics Center (FRC) has developed a number of significant robots, including Sandstorm and H1ghlander, which finished second and third in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, and Boss, which won the 2007 DARPA Grand Challenge.

==Media coverage and awards==
In his book &quot;Almost Human: Making Robots Think&quot;, Lee Gutkind describes the development of robots at the Robotics Institute, particularly focusing on the developers and describing field testing in remote locations.

The robot HERB was featured in the &quot;Oreo Separator&quot; video series.

RI robots and researchers have been featured in the Scientific American Frontiers episode &quot;Natural Born Robots&quot; and in multiple NPR radio segments.

The Advanced Robotic Laser Coating Removal System (ARLCRS) won a 2013 Edison Award gold award in the category of materials science processes.

<doc id="613082" wikidata="Q217766" url="?curid=613082" title="Symphony No. 25 (Mozart)">
<text>The Symphony No. 25 in G minor, K. 183/173dB, was written by the then 17-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in October 1773, shortly after the success of his opera seria &quot;Lucio Silla&quot;. It was supposedly completed in Salzburg on October 5, a mere two days after the completion of his Symphony No. 24, although this remains unsubstantiated. Its first movement was used as the opening music in Miloš Forman&#x27;s biographical film &quot;Amadeus&quot;.

This is one of two symphonies Mozart composed in G minor, sometimes referred to as the &quot;little G minor symphony&quot;. The other is the Symphony No. 40; see also Mozart and G minor.

== Movements ==

The symphony is laid out in standard classical form:

#Allegro con brio, in G minor
#Andante, in E-flat major
#Menuetto &amp; Trio,  in G minor, Trio in G major
#Allegro, in G minor

This symphony is scored for two oboes, two bassoons, four horns and strings.

== Style and influence ==
With its wide-leap melodic lines and syncopation, this symphony is characteristic of the &quot;&quot; style. It shares certain features with other &quot;Sturm and Drang&quot; symphonies of this time, and is likely inspired by Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 39, also in G minor.

== Performance history ==

The work was first performed in the United States by the Boston Symphony Orchestra on October 27, 1899, under the direction of Wilhelm Gericke. It was not performed again in the US until 1937, when rendered by the Alfred Wallenstein Sinfonietta. John Barbirolli and the New York Philharmonic performed it again in 1941 as part of their centennial season.

In 1990, Deutsche Grammophon released a recording of this symphony performed by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Leonard Bernstein, with Peter Schmidl as the principal clarinetist.

== In popular culture ==
The first movement plays over the opening credits of &quot;Amadeus&quot;, the 1984 Oscar-winning biographical film about Mozart. This version was recorded by The Academy of St. Martin in the Fields and Neville Marriner.

Beginning in the 1990s, the Titan Company (an Indian manufacturer of fashion accessories) released several television advertisements for their Quartz line of watches. Oglivy &amp; Mather, the agency that produced the advertisements, selected a phrase from Allegro con brio as the theme music. These advertisements became iconic and helped popularize the brand. Several versions were produced aside from the traditional arrangement, like one played solely on the piano. Titan also produced an advertisement featuring an electronic backing track overlaid with the theme played on several Indian musical instruments by renowned musicians. These included Ravi Shankar on the sitar and the father-son duo of Alla Rakha and Zakir Hussain on the tabla.

<doc id="613084" wikidata="Q7622275" url="?curid=613084" title="Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.">
<text>Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., 23 Media L. Rep. 1794 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1995), is a decision of the New York Supreme Court holding that online service providers can be liable for the speech of their users. The ruling caused controversy among early supporters of the Internet, including some lawmakers, leading to the passage of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996.

==Facts==
Prodigy, an early online content hosting site, hosted a bulletin board called &quot;Money Talk&quot; on which anonymous persons could post messages about finance and investing. In October 1994, an unidentified user on &quot;Money Talk&quot; submitted a post claiming that Stratton Oakmont, a securities investment banking firm based in Long Island, New York, and its president Danny Porush, had committed criminal and fraudulent acts in connection with a stock IPO. Stratton Oakmont sued Prodigy as well as the unidentified poster for defamation.

==Court ruling==

Stratton Oakmont argued that Prodigy should be considered a publisher of the defamatory material, and was therefore liable for the postings under the common law definition of defamation. Prodigy requested a dismissal of the complaint, on the grounds that it could not be held liable for the content of postings created by its third-party users. This argument cited the 1991 precedent &quot;Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc.&quot;, which had found CompuServe, an online service provider, not liable as a publisher for user-generated content.

The &quot;Stratton&quot; court held that Prodigy was liable as the publisher of the content created by its users because it exercised editorial control over the messages on its bulletin boards in three ways: 1) by posting content guidelines for users; 2) by enforcing those guidelines with &quot;Board Leaders&quot;; and 3) by utilizing screening software designed to remove offensive language. The court&#x27;s general argument for holding Prodigy liable, distinguishing from the CompuServe case, was that &quot;Prodigy&#x27;s conscious choice, to gain the benefits of editorial control, has opened it up to a greater liability than CompuServe and other computer networks that make no such choice.&quot;

==Impact==
This case conflicted with the 1991 federal district court decision in &quot;Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc.&quot;, which had suggested that courts should not consider online service providers to be publishers. In that case, the court held that CompuServe and other website operators should be considered more like a library than a publisher. The important difference between CompuServe and Prodigy for the &quot;Stratton&quot; court was that Prodigy engaged in content screening and therefore exercised editorial control.

Some federal legislators noticed the contradiction in the two rulings, while Internet enthusiasts found that expecting website operators to accept liability for the speech of third-party users was both untenable and likely to stifle the development of the Internet. Representatives Christopher Cox (R-CA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) co-authored legislation that would resolve the contradictory precedents on liability while enabling websites and platforms to host speech and exercise editorial control to moderate objectionable content without incurring unlimited liability by doing so. The legislation, originally titled the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act, passed the House on August 4, 1995 by a vote of 420 to 4. Six months later, this bill was added to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 during the House-Senate conference. The conference report including the Cox-Wyden legislation as part of the Communications Decency Act (a subsection of the Telecommunications Act) was then passed by the Senate by a vote of 91-5 on February 1, 1996. 

In 1997, the rest of the Communications Decency Act was overturned by the Supreme Court as an unconstitutional speech restriction, but Section 230 was upheld and is still in effect, because it was intended to enable speech rather than restrict it. Section 230 also served to overturn the New York Supreme Court ruling in the &quot;Stratton&quot; case, as the legislation clarified that website operators and Internet service providers are not to be considered &quot;publishers&quot; of third-party content and instead merely provide a platform for their users.

<text>Kinsley Scott Bingham (December 16, 1808October 5, 1861) was a U.S. Representative, a U.S. Senator, and the 11th governor of Michigan.

==Early life in New York==
Bingham (whose first name is sometimes spelled &quot;Kingsley&quot;) was born to the farmer family of Calvin and Betsy (Scott) Bingham in Camillus, New York in Onondaga County. He attended the common schools and studied law in Syracuse. In 1833, while still in New York, Bingham married Margaret Warden, who had recently moved with her brother Robert Warden and family from Scotland.

==Life and politics in Michigan==
Bingham moved with his wife, in 1833 to Green Oak Township, Michigan where he was admitted to the bar and began a private practice. In 1834, his only child with Margaret, Kinsley W. Bingham (1838–1908), was born and his wife died four days later. He engaged in agricultural pursuits and held a number of local offices including justice of the peace, postmaster, and first judge of the probate court of Livingston County.

Bingham became a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1837, was reelected four times and served as speaker of the house in 1838–1839, and 1842. In 1839, Bingham married Mary Warden, the younger sister of his first wife, and in 1840 their only child was born, James W. Bingham (1840–1862).

In 1846, he was elected as a Democratic Representative from Michigan&#x27;s 3rd congressional district to the 30th and 31st Congresses, serving from March 4, 1847 to March 3, 1851. He was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State in the 31st Congress. He was instrumental in securing approval for building the Beaver Island Head Lighthouse on the south end of Beaver Island in Lake Michigan. He was strongly opposed to the expansion of slavery and was one of minority of Democrats who supported the Wilmot Proviso. Bingham was not a candidate for re-election in 1850 and resumed agricultural pursuits. He affiliated himself with the Free Soil Party and was later a Republican.

==Gubernatorial and senate career==
In 1854, Bingham was elected as the 11th (and first Republican) governor of Michigan and was re-elected in 1856; he is among the first Republicans to be elected governor of any state. He was known as the farmer-Governor of Michigan and was instrumental in establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan (today, Michigan State University) and other educational institutions such as the State Reform School. Also during his four years in office, a personal liberty law was sanctioned, legislation that regulated the lumber industry was authorized, and several new counties and villages were established. He was also a delegate from Michigan to the Republican National Convention in 1856 that nominated John C. Fremont for U.S. President, who lost to Democrat James Buchanan.

Bingham was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1858 and served in the 36th and 37th Congresses from March 4, 1859, until his death on October 5, 1861. He was chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills in the 37th Congress. He campaigned actively for the election of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln in 1860.

==Death and legacy==
He died in Green Oak while in office at age 52 and was originally interred at a private family graveyard in Livingston County. He was reinterred at Old Village Cemetery of Brighton, Michigan.

There are three townships named for him in Michigan:
*Bingham Township, Clinton County, Michigan
*Bingham Township, Huron County, Michigan
*Bingham Township, Leelanau County, Michigan

==Memorials==
A painting of Bingham now hangs in the Michigan State Capitol.

<text>Sankranti () refers to the transmigration of the sun from one zodiac to another in Indian astronomy. In &quot;Saurmana&quot; &quot;varsha&quot; (Hindu Solar year), there are twelve Sankrantis corresponding with twelve months of a year. The Sankrantis can be broadly classified into four main categories: &quot;Ayan&quot; (Solstice), &quot;Vishuva&quot; (Equinox), &quot;Vishnupadi&quot; and &quot;Shadshitimukhi&quot; sankrantis.

Each Sankranti is marked as the beginning of a month in the sidereal solar calendars followed in South Indian states: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka; Himalayan states: Jammu region, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, North Punjab and states of Eastern India: Odisha, Mithila region of Bihar and Nepal. On the other hand, in the sidereal solar Bengali calendar and Assamese calendar, a Sankranti is marked as the end of each month and the day following as the beginning of a new month.

==Important Sankrantis==
* Makar Sankranti: Marks the transition of the Sun into Makara Râshi (Capricorn) on its celestial path, and the six-month Uttarayana period. Makar Sankranti is also called Uttarayana - the day on which the sun begins his northward journey. The traditional Indian calendar is based on lunar positions, Sankranti is a solar event. The date of Makar Sankranti remains constant over a long term, 14 January or occasionally, 15 January as the Sun begins to rise in Makara Râshi.
*Mesha Sankranti: Marks the beginning of the New Year in the traditional Hindu Solar Calendar. On this day, the sun enters the sidereal Aries, or Mesha Râshi. It generally falls on 14/15 April. Regional New Year festivals also take place on this day: Vishu in Kerala, Puthandu in Tamil Nadu, Bisu Parba in Tulu Nadu region, Vaisakhi in the Punjab region, Pana Sankranti in Odisha, Jude Sheetal in Mithila region of Bihar and Satuaan in Bhojpuri region and on the day after Mesha Sankranti, is Pohela Boishakh in Bengal and Bohag Bihu in Assam and Sri Lanka
* Mithuna Sankranti: celebrated as annual menstruating phase of Mother Earth as Raja Parba or Ambubachi Mela in Eastern and North Eastern provinces of India.
* Dhanu Sankranti: celebrated on the first day of the solar month. In Southern Bhutan and Nepal it is celebrated by eating wild potatoes (Darul). The 2017 date is December 17.
* Karka Sankranti: July 16, marks the transition of the Sun into Karka Râshi (Cancer). This also marks the end of the six-month Uttarayana period on the Hindu calendar, and the beginning of Dakshinayana, which itself end at Makar Sankranti.
*Simha Sankranti: It is celebrated on the first day of the solar month on the Hindu calendar i.e. Bhadrapada. The festival holds special significance in Ramban district of Jammu division. People visit Chandrabhaga river and offer floral offerings. It is popularly known by the name &quot;Singh Sankrant.&quot; Local tradition traces the origin of the festival to Pandavas.
*Nol Sankranti: It is celebrated on the first day of the solar month on the Hindu calendar i.e. Kartik (month). It is also called Dak Sankranti. Sadh Bhokhon or Godbharai is a special tradition for pregnant Hindu women. Hindu people believe that rice plants are too pregnant from the middle of September to the middle of October, so the farmers arrange a ritual for good production of paddy like the production of the Nol plant. Borassus flabellifer seeds are used as prasad. The festival holds special significance in West Bengal and Assam state.

<doc id="613089" wikidata="Q1001165" url="?curid=613089" title="Tango (flamenco)">
<text>In flamenco a tango () is one of the flamenco palos closely related in form and feeling to the rumba flamenca. It is often performed as a finale to a flamenco tiento. Its compás and llamada are the same as that of the farruca and share the farruca&#x27;s lively nature. However, the tango is normally performed in the A Phrygian mode. In some English sources the flamenco tango is written with an -s; &quot;the tangos is...&quot;

The flamenco tango is distinct from the flamenco rumba primarily through the guitar playing. In Rumba the guitar flows more freely, whereas in Tangos the accents on beats 2, 3, and 4 are marked clearly with heavy strumming.

Tangos is only vaguely related to Argentine tango, and objectively they only share &quot;compás binario&quot; or double stroke rhythm. The fact that Argentine tango is one of the first couple dances in America has led historians to believe that both could be based in a minuet-style European dance, therefore sharing a common ancestor, while those who compare the present day forms do not see them as related.

== Example Lyrics ==
&quot;Triana, Triana,&quot;
&quot;qué bonita está Triana,&quot; (Triana, how beautiful it is!)
&quot;qué bonita está Triana, qué bonita está Triana&quot;

<doc id="613092" wikidata="Q415968" url="?curid=613092" title="Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase">
<text>An aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS or ARS), also called tRNA-ligase, is an enzyme that attaches the appropriate amino acid onto its corresponding tRNA. It does so by catalyzing the transesterification of a specific cognate amino acid or its precursor to one of all its compatible cognate tRNAs to form an aminoacyl-tRNA. In humans, the 20 different types of aa-tRNA are made by the 20 different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, one for each amino acid of the genetic code.

This is sometimes called &quot;charging&quot; or &quot;loading&quot; the tRNA with an amino acid. Once the tRNA is charged, a ribosome can transfer the amino acid from the tRNA onto a growing peptide, according to the genetic code. Aminoacyl tRNA therefore plays an important role in RNA translation, the expression of genes to create proteins.

==Mechanism==
The synthetase first binds ATP and the corresponding amino acid (or its precursor) to form an aminoacyl-adenylate, releasing inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). The adenylate-aaRS complex then binds the appropriate tRNA molecule&#x27;s D arm, and the amino acid is transferred from the aa-AMP to either the 2&#x27;- or the 3&#x27;-OH of the last tRNA nucleotide (A76) at the 3&#x27;-end.

The mechanism can be summarized in the following reaction series:
# Amino Acid + ATP → Aminoacyl-AMP + PPi
# Aminoacyl-AMP + tRNA → Aminoacyl-tRNA + AMP

Summing the reactions, the highly exergonic overall reaction is as follows:

* Amino Acid + tRNA + ATP → Aminoacyl-tRNA + AMP + PPi

Some synthetases also mediate an editing reaction to ensure high fidelity of tRNA charging. If the incorrect tRNA is added (aka. the tRNA is found to be improperly charged), the aminoacyl-tRNA bond is hydrolyzed. This can happen when two amino acids have different properties even if they have similar shapes—as is the case with valine and threonine.

The accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is so high that it is often paired with the word &quot;superspecificity” when it is compared to other enzymes that are involved in metabolism. Although not all synthetases have a domain with the sole purpose of editing, they make up for it by having specific binding and activation of their affiliated amino acids. Another contribution to the accuracy of these synthetases is the ratio of concentrations of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and its cognate tRNA. Since tRNA synthetase improperly acylates the tRNA when the synthetase is overproduced, a limit must exist on the levels of aaRSs and tRNAs in vivo.

==Classes==
There are two classes of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, each composed of ten enzymes:

*Class I has two highly conserved sequence motifs. It aminoacylates at the 2&#x27;-OH of a terminal adenosine nucleotide on tRNA, and it is usually monomeric or dimeric (one or two subunits, respectively).
*Class II has three highly conserved sequence motifs. It aminoacylates at the 3&#x27;-OH of a terminal adenosine on tRNA, and is usually dimeric or tetrameric (two or four subunits, respectively). Although phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase is class II, it aminoacylates at the 2&#x27;-OH.

The amino acids are attached to the hydroxyl (-OH) group of the adenosine via the carboxyl (-COOH) group.

Regardless of where the aminoacyl is initially attached to the nucleotide, the 2&#x27;-&quot;O&quot;-aminoacyl-tRNA will ultimately migrate to the 3&#x27; position via transesterification.

Bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can be grouped as follows:

Amino acids which use class II aaRS seem to be evolutionarily older.

==Structures==

Both classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are multidomain proteins. In a typical scenario, an aaRS consists of a catalytic domain (where both the above reactions take place) and an anticodon binding domain (which interacts mostly with the anticodon region of the tRNA). Transfer-RNAs for different amino acids differ not only in their anticodon but also at other points, giving them slightly different overall configurations. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize the correct tRNAs primarily through their overall configuration, not just through their anticodon. In addition, some aaRSs have additional RNA binding domains and editing domains that cleave incorrectly paired aminoacyl-tRNA molecules.

The catalytic domains of all the aaRSs of a given class are found to be homologous to one another, whereas class I and class II aaRSs are unrelated to one another. The class I aaRSs feature a cytidylyltransferase-like Rossmann fold seen in proteins like glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase and archaeal FAD synthase, whereas the class II aaRSs have a unique fold related to biotin and lipoate ligases.

The alpha helical anticodon binding domain of arginyl-, glycyl- and cysteinyl-tRNA synthetases is known as the DALR domain after characteristic conserved amino acids.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been kinetically studied, showing that Mg2+ ions play an active catalytic role and therefore aaRs have a degree of magnesium dependence. Increasing the Mg2+ concentration leads to an increase in the equilibrium constants for the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases’ reactions. Although this trend was seen in both class I and class II synthetases, the magnesium dependence for the two classes are very distinct. Class II synthetases have two or (more frequently) three Mg2+ ions, while class I only requires one Mg2+ ion.

Beside their lack of overall sequence and structure similarity, class I and class II synthetases feature different ATP recognition mechanisms. While class I binds via interactions mediated by backbone hydrogen bonds, class II uses a pair of arginine residues to establish salt bridges to its ATP ligand. This oppositional implementation is manifested in two structural motifs, the Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers, which are observable in all class I and class II structures, respectively. The high structural conservation of these motifs suggest that they must have been present since ancient times.

==Evolution==

Most of the aaRSs of a given specificity are evolutionarily closer to one another than to aaRSs of another specificity. However, AsnRS and GlnRS group within AspRS and GluRS, respectively. Most of the aaRSs of a given specificity also belong to a single class. However, there are two distinct versions of the LysRS - one belonging to the class I family and the other belonging to the class II family.

The molecular phylogenies of aaRSs are often not consistent with accepted organismal phylogenies. That is, they violate the so-called canonical phylogenetic pattern shown by most other enzymes for the three domains of life - &quot;Archaea&quot;, &quot;Bacteria&quot;, and &quot;Eukarya&quot;. Furthermore, the phylogenies inferred for aaRSs of different amino acids often do not agree with one another. In addition, aaRS paralogs within the same species show a high degree of divergence between them. These are clear indications that horizontal transfer has occurred several times during the evolutionary history of aaRSs.

A widespread belief in the evolutionary stability of this superfamily, meaning that every organism has all the aaRSs for their corresponding amino acids, is misconceived. A large-scale genomic analysis on ~2500 prokaryotic genomes showed that many of them miss one or more aaRS genes whereas many genomes have 1 or more paralogs. AlaRS, GlyRS, LeuRS, IleRS and ValRS are the most evolutionarily stable members of the family. GluRS, LysRS and CysRS often have paralogs, whereas AsnRS, GlnRS, PylRS and SepRS are often absent from many genomes.

With the exception of AlaRS, it has been discovered that 19 out of the 20 human aaRSs have added at least one new domain or motif. These new domains and motifs vary in function and are observed in various forms of life. A common novel function within human aaRSs is providing additional regulation of biological processes. There exists a theory that the increasing number of aaRSs that add domains is due to the continuous evolution of higher organisms with more complex and efficient building blocks and biological mechanisms. One key piece of evidence to this theory is that after a new domain is added to an aaRS, the domain becomes fully integrated. This new domain&#x27;s functionality is conserved from that point on.

As genetic efficiency evolved in higher organisms, 13 new domains with no obvious association with the catalytic activity of aaRSs genes have been added.

==Application in biotechnology==

In some of the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, the cavity that holds the amino acid can be mutated and modified to carry unnatural amino acids synthesized in the lab, and to attach them to specific tRNAs. This expands the genetic code, beyond the twenty canonical amino acids found in nature, to include an unnatural amino acid as well. The unnatural amino acid is coded by a nonsense (TAG, TGA, TAA) triplet, a quadruplet codon, or in some cases a redundant rare codon. The organism that expresses the mutant synthetase can then be genetically programmed to incorporate the unnatural amino acid into any desired position in any protein of interest, allowing biochemists or structural biologists to probe or change the protein&#x27;s function. For instance, one can start with the gene for a protein that binds a certain sequence of DNA, and, by directing an unnatural amino acid with a reactive side-chain into the binding site, create a new protein that cuts the DNA at the target-sequence, rather than binding it.

By mutating aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, chemists have expanded the genetic codes of various organisms to include lab-synthesized amino acids with all kinds of useful properties: photoreactive, metal-chelating, xenon-chelating, crosslinking, spin-resonant, fluorescent, biotinylated, and redox-active amino acids. Another use is introducing amino acids bearing reactive functional groups for chemically modifying the target protein.

Certain diseases’ causation (such as neuronal pathologies, cancer, disturbed metabolic conditions, and autoimmune disorders) have been correlated to specific mutations of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most frequent heritable disorder of the peripheral nervous system (a neuronal disease) and is caused by a heritable mutation in glycol-tRNA and tyrosyl-tRNA. Diabetes, a metabolic disease, induces oxidative stress, which triggers a build up of mitochondrial tRNA mutations. It has also been discovered that tRNA synthetases may be partially involved in the etiology of cancer. A high level of expression or modification of aaRSs has been observed within a range of cancers. A common outcome from mutations of aaRSs is a disturbance of dimer shape/formation which has a direct relationship with its function. These correlations between aaRSs and certain diseases have opened up a new door to synthesizing therapeutics.

==Noncatalytic domains==

The novel domain additions to aaRS genes are accretive and progressive up the &quot;Tree of Life&quot;. The strong evolutionary pressure for these small non-catalytic protein domains suggested their importance. Findings beginning in 1999 and later revealed a previously unrecognized layer of biology: these proteins control gene expression within the cell of origin, and when released exert homeostatic and developmental control in specific human cell types, tissues and organs during adult or fetal development or both, including pathways associated with &quot;angiogenesis&quot;, &quot;inflammation&quot;, the &quot;immune response&quot;, the &quot;mechanistic target of rapamycin&quot; (mTOR) signalling, &quot;apoptosis&quot;, &quot;tumorigenesis&quot;, and &quot;interferon gamma&quot; (IFN-) and &quot;p53&quot; signalling.

== Substrate depletion ==
In 2022, it was discovered that aminoacyl-trna synthetases may incorporate alternative amino acids during shortages of their precursors. In particular, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS1) will incorporate phenylalanine during tryptophan depletion, essentially inducing a W&gt;F codon reassignment. Depletion of the other substrate of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the cognate tRNA, may be relevant to certain diseases, e.g. Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. It was shown that CMT-mutant glycyl-tRNA synthetase variants are still able to bind tRNA-gly but fail to release it, leading to depletion of the cellular pool of glycyl-tRNA-gly, what in turn results in stalling of the ribosome on glycine codons during mRNA translation.

==Clinical==

Mutations in the mitochondrial enzyme have been associated with a number of genetic disorders including Leigh syndrome, West syndrome and CAGSSS (cataracts, growth hormone deficiency, sensory neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss and skeletal dysplasia syndrome).

<doc id="613103" wikidata="Q2740167" url="?curid=613103" title="United States National Radio Quiet Zone">
<text>The National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) is a large area of land in the United States designated as a radio quiet zone, in which radio transmissions are restricted by law to facilitate scientific research and the gathering of military intelligence. About half of the zone is located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of west-central Virginia while the other half is in the Allegheny Mountains of east-central West Virginia; a small part of the zone is in the southernmost tip of the Maryland panhandle.

== Location ==
The Quiet Zone is an approximate rectangle of land, on the north edge, on the south edge and on the east and west edges, comprising approximately . It straddles the borders of Virginia and West Virginia, and also includes a small part of Maryland. The NRQZ is centered between the Green Bank Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, and Sugar Grove Station in Sugar Grove, West Virginia. It includes all land with latitudes between 37° 30′ 0.4″ N and 39° 15′ 0.4″ N, and longitudes between 78° 29′ 59.0″ W and 80° 29′ 59.2″ W.

== Restrictions ==
Most broadcast transmitters in the central area of the Quiet Zone are required to operate at reduced power and use directional antennas. This makes cable and satellite essential for acceptable television in much of the region. Restrictions of transmissions are strictest within ten miles (16 km) of the Green Bank and Sugar Grove facilities, where most omnidirectional and high-power transmissions are prohibited.

Not all radio transmissions are prohibited in the Quiet Zone. For example, emergency service (police, fire, and ambulance) radios and CB radios are permitted. However, owners of high-power transmitters, including television stations in the Harrisonburg–Staunton and Charlottesville markets, must coordinate their operations with the Green Bank Observatory. The only broadcast radio stations in the core of the Quiet Zone are part of the Allegheny Mountain Radio network, with one daytimer AM station in Frost, West Virginia, ten miles from the observatory, and low-powered FM stations in Monterey, Virginia and Marlinton, West Virginia. Exceptions to restrictions are usually determined case by case, with preference given to public safety concerns, such as for remote alarm systems, repeaters for emergency services, and NOAA Weather Radio.

The most severe restrictions to the general public are imposed within a 20-mile (32 km) radius of the Green Bank Observatory. The Observatory polices the area actively for devices emitting excessive electromagnetic radiation such as microwave ovens, Wi-Fi access points, and faulty electrical equipment and asks people to stop using such equipment. It does not have enforcement power (although the FCC can impose a fine of $50 on violators) but will work with residents to find solutions.

Cellular telephone use in the central area of the zone is also very restricted. However, the observatory has pulled back on Quiet Zone enforcement, and locals have increasingly embraced the usage of microwave ovens, cellphones, and WiFi.The Green Bank resident and high school teacher had a microwave. She had a smartphone. She had Wi-Fi. She knew where to get a cell phone signal. “It’s not like we’re living some bohemian lifestyle,” she told me. Such was hardly a secret. A house across the street from the observatory had Wi-Fi with the network name “Screw you NRAO,” an unsubtle middle finger to the observatory’s calls for quiet. Green Bank’s health clinic had Wi-Fi. So did the senior center. “We’re not supposed to,” said John Simmons, the county’s director of senior programs and a former county commissioner, “but I think all that stuff about the noise levels is fabricated.” In 2019, the Green Bank Interference Protection Group was picking up about 175 hotspots within two miles of the observatory.

===Zones of protection===

The Green Bank Interference Protection Group maintains policies to manage radio-frequency interference (RFI) by dividing into five zones based on available legal instruments. The National Radio Quiet Zone Administrator at the Green Bank Observatory manages the enforcement policies.

Zones 1 and Zone 2 are located within the property of the Green Bank Observatory. The entire property is designated &quot;Zone 1&quot; except small portions (such as housing, visitor, and laboratory areas) that are designated &quot;Zone 2&quot;. Zone 1, the &quot;Radio Astronomy Instrument Zone&quot;, restricts intentional radiators to those that are deemed essential. All unintentional radiators must be operated within the recommendations on protection criteria used for radio astronomical measurements. Gasoline-powered motor vehicles are prohibited in Zone 1 as their spark-ignition engines generate significant radio interference, resulting in the requirement that all vehicles and equipment be diesel-powered. Zone 2, the &quot;Observatory Building Zone&quot;, allows intentional radiators licensed by the National Radio Quiet Zone but not other radiators such as Wi-Fi, cordless phones, and other wireless equipment. Certain types of unintentional radiators are allowed. Digital cameras are prohibited, although film photography is allowed.

Zone 3 and Zone 4 are governed by the Radio Astronomy Zoning Act, Chapter 37A of the West Virginia Code. It strictly regulates radio transmitters within of the Green Bank Observatory. Zone 3, the area within , has the greatest restriction; it is surrounded by Zone 4, in which progressively greater emissions are allowed at greater distances. Within these zones, interference to observations are identified and documented. The owners of the offending equipment are visited personally to request cooperation in eliminating the interference. Enforcement is used as a last resort. Enforcement in Zone 4 may be more lenient than the limit set by Chapter 37A.

Zone 5 is the outermost part of the National Radio Quiet Zone.

== Uses ==
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) created the Quiet Zone in 1958 to protect the radio telescopes at Green Bank and Sugar Grove from harmful interference. Today, the Green Bank Observatory oversees the Quiet Zone.

The Quiet Zone also protects the antennas and receivers of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Information Operations Command (NIOC) at Sugar Grove. The NIOC is the location of electronic intelligence-gathering systems and is today said to be a key station in the ECHELON system operated by the National Security Agency (NSA).

The area has also attracted people who believe they suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity, though scientific experiments have shown this condition is caused by the nocebo effect rather than electromagnetic waves.

<text>George Clyde Kell (August 23, 1922 – March 24, 2009) was an American professional baseball player and television sports commentator. He played in Major League Baseball as a third baseman from 1943 to 1957, most prominently as a member of the Detroit Tigers where, he became a perennial All-Star player, and won the American League (AL) batting championship in .

A ten-time All-Star player, Kell hit .300 or higher in nine seasons, producing a career batting average of .306 and led the league’s third basemen in fielding percentage seven times over a major league playing career that spanned 15 seasons. While lacking home run power, Kell was an outstanding contact hitter. He struck out only 287 times in 6,702 at-bats during his career, averaging just 26 strikeouts per 162 games.

Kell began his baseball career with the Philadelphia Athletics and later played for the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox and the Baltimore Orioles. After his playing career, Kell became a Detroit Tigers television play by play announcer for 37 years. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983.

==Baseball career==
In college, Kell played for Arkansas State, where the baseball facility, Tomlinson Stadium–Kell Field, is named after him.

Kell was a ten-time All-Star, batted over .300 nine times and topped the league&#x27;s third basemen in assists and total chances four times and in fielding percentage seven times.

===Athletics===

Kell entered the leagues with the Philadelphia Athletics as a September call-up in the 1943 season. He appeared in one game on September 28, facing the St. Louis Browns as the starting third baseman and batted third.

The next year, he would play 139 games for the Athletics, and Kell batted .268 while having 138 hits while receiving a few votes for MVP. It was the first season that he would finish in the top ten in at-bats per strikeout, going 22.3 at-bats per strikeout to finish 8th in the American League. The following year, he would improve by batting .272 with 154 hits (30 doubles). 

===Tigers===
In 1946, Kell played 26 games with the Athletics before being traded to Detroit on May 18 for Barney McCosky. In the American League, he ranked in the top ten for batting average with .322 for the year (fourth) and on-base percentage with .372 (9th) alongside hits (168, 8th). He also led the league in sacrifice hits with 15. On September 20 of that season, Kell went 6-for-7 with 4 runs and 3 RBI in a 15-1 rout of the Cleveland Indians. He played 131 games at third base and led the league in putouts, assists, fielding percentage and double plays.

He played 152 games in 1947 and hit .320 with 188 hits, garnering his first All-Star selection and finishing 5th in MVP voting. He was hampered by issues in the 1948 season, playing just 92 games while batting .304 with 112 hits, although he garnered MVP voting and an All-Star selection. He would bounce back in with his first and only batting title by batting .343, denying Ted Williams his third Triple Crown; until the final week of the season, Williams had led the batting race. On October 2, 1949, Kell went 2-for-3 while Williams was hitless in two official at bats. Kell&#x27;s final mark was .3429, Williams&#x27; .3427. He had 179 hits while walking a career high 71 times (leading to a career-high .424 on-base percentage), and he struck out only 13 times all season.
One year later, Kell batted .340, leading the majors with 218 hits and 56 doubles, but lost the batting title to Williams&#x27; teammate, Red Sox second baseman Billy Goodman. However, he led the league in numerous hitting categories, played in 157 games and had a .982 fielding percentage, which was the third time he had topped .980. He scored 114 runs and had 101 RBI. Kell&#x27;s 56 doubles were the most by a Tiger since Charlie Gehringer had 60 doubles in 1936 and remains the third-most by a Tiger player as of 2022.

He led the league in hits for a second and final time the next season (1951), having 191 in 147 games to go with 36 doubles while batting .319. It would be his last full year with the Tigers, as he was traded after 39 games in 1952 alongside Hoot Evers, Johnny Lipon and Dizzy Trout to the Boston Red Sox for Walt Dropo, Fred Hatfield, Don Lenhardt, Johnny Pesky and Bill Wight.

===Red Sox, White Sox and Orioles===

His tenure with Boston saw the team engage in attempts at stealing signs involving the scoreboard, and it wasn&#x27;t long after his trade to Chicago (done on May 23, 1954, for Grady Hatton and cash) that management asked him about the system. He worked with teammate Bob Kennedy, general manager Frank Lane, and the ballpark crew on a system that used the scoreboard to flash a light (i.e. a one or a zero) for a certain type of pitch while Kennedy had binoculars to see signs. 

Reportedly the scheme persisted long after Kell left the team in 1956 (the White Sox won the pennant three years later). 
He spent the 1954 season playing mostly at third and first base with minimal time in the outfield. With 97 games, he batted .276. He continued this positioning for 1955, although he played 128 total games while batting .312 with 81 RBIs and 51 walks. He went through one more early season-trade with 1956, where he played 123 games while batting .271 with 115 hits with 33 walks and 37 strikeouts while being traded by the White Sox after 21 games on May 21, going with Mike Fornieles, Connie Johnson and Bob Nieman to the Baltimore Orioles for Dave Philley and Jim Wilson. He would spend time at third base while sharing time with second-year third baseman and fellow Arkansan Brooks Robinson (also a future Hall of Famer). He batted .271 for the year while having 115 hits and 48 RBIs with 37 strikeouts to 33 walks (marking the second and last time he had more strikeouts than walks, with the only other one being in 1944, his first full year). He made it to the All-Star Game that year, his ninth selection. 1956 was the tenth and final time that he ranked in the top ten for at-bats per strikeout, in which he went 11.5 at-bats between strikeouts.

He closed his career out in 1957, hitting .297 in 99 games while collecting his 2,000th hit during the year and making another All-Star Game while striking out 16 times with 25 walks.

In his career, Kell batted .306, with 78 home runs and 870 runs batted in, 881 runs scored, 2054 hits, 385 doubles, 50 triples, 51 stolen bases, a .414 slugging average, and 621 walks for a .367 on-base percentage. He posted a career .971 fielding percentage. Kell played 1,795 games, but he never played for a team that made the postseason or the World Series.

Kell was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1983. A quote from his induction speech at the Hall of Fame goes as follows, &quot;I have suspected for a long time that George Kell has taken more from this great game than he would ever be able to put back. And now today I know that I am more deeply in debt than ever before.&quot;

==Broadcasting career==
Following his retirement as a player, Kell worked as a play-by-play announcer for CBS television (1958) and the Tigers (1959–1963, 1965–1996). Kell also called the 1959 National League tie-breaker series for ABC television with Bob DeLaney, the second 1962 All-Star Game for NBC Radio with Jack Quinlan, the 1962 National League tie-breaker series for NBC television with Bob Wolff, the 1962 World Series for NBC Radio with Joe Garagiola, and Games 3–5 of the 1968 World Series (for which the Tigers were the home team) for NBC television with Curt Gowdy.

Kell initially called Tigers games on both radio and television, splitting the play-by-play with Van Patrick (in the 1959 season) and then with Ernie Harwell. Following the 1963 season he briefly retired from broadcasting, citing a desire to spend more time at his Arkansas home; after a one-year absence, Kell was persuaded to return in 1965 working the (less frequent) TV games exclusively while Harwell did radio. Kell&#x27;s subsequent television partners included Ray Lane, Larry Osterman, and (beginning in 1975) fellow Hall of Famer and former Tiger Al Kaline as color commentator, the latter pairing lasting for the remainder of Kell&#x27;s broadcast career. He retired from the TV booth following the 1996 season.

==Personal life==
Kell served for ten years on the Arkansas State Highway Commission (1973–83) and owned a car dealership, George Kell Motors, in Newport.

Kell&#x27;s brother, Everett &quot;Skeeter&quot; Kell, played the 1952 season for the Philadelphia Athletics.

Kell and his wife Charlene were married for 50 years until her death from cancer in 1991.

Bestselling author Elmore Leonard, in the 1990 anthology &quot;Cult Baseball Players&quot;, wrote that Kell was his favorite player. When the novelist threw out the first pitch at a June 15, 1999, Tigers game at Tiger Stadium, Leonard wore a No. 21 jersey that was presented to him by the Tigers in an homage to Kell (who wore the number for four of his seven seasons).

==Death==
Kell died at age 86 in his sleep in his hometown of Swifton, Arkansas, on March 24, 2009.

Fox Sports Detroit, by then the Tigers&#x27; local TV rights holder, honored Kell with re-airings of the special &quot;FSN Basement: All Star Edition 2005&quot; featuring interviews with Kell and Al Kaline, each recalling his memories of playing for the Tigers and working together in the television booth. It re-aired several times during the week following his death.

<text>Liberty Hall (), in Dublin, Ireland, is the headquarters of the Services, Industrial, Professional, and Technical Union (SIPTU). Designed by Desmond Rea O&#x27;Kelly, it was completed in 1965. It was for a time the tallest building in the country, at 59.4 meters, (195 feet) high until it was superseded by the County Hall in Cork city, which was itself superseded by The Elysian in Cork. Liberty Hall is now the fifth tallest building in Dublin, after Capital Dock, the Exo Building, Montevetro (now Google Docks) and the Millennium Tower in Grand Canal Dock.

Liberty Hall is more historically significant in its earlier form, as the headquarters of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union early in the 20th century, and also as the headquarters of the Irish Citizen Army (ICA).

== History ==

Standing on Beresford Place and Eden Quay, near the Custom House, the original Liberty Hall was built as the Northumberland Hotel before it became the headquarters of the Irish Citizen Army. During the 1913 Dublin Lock-out a soup kitchen for workers&#x27; families was run there by Maud Gonne and Constance Markievicz. Following the outbreak of the First World War a banner reading &quot;We Serve Neither King nor Kaiser, But Ireland&quot; was hung on its front wall, and ICA&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Irish Worker,&quot; was printed inside. The newspaper was shut down by the Dublin Castle administration for sedition under the Defence of the Realm Act. It was replaced for a short time by a paper called &quot;The Worker&quot; until that too was banned. James Connolly edited a third paper, &quot;The Workers&#x27; Republic&quot;, from 1915 until the Easter Rising in 1916.
Until the Easter Rising, Liberty Hall also served as a munitions factory, where bombs and bayonets were made for the impending rebellion. It was on the street in front of the building that the leaders of the Rising assembled before their march to the General Post Office on Easter Monday. They left the building vacant throughout Easter Week save for Peter Ennis, the Building Manager/Caretaker, who remained there throughout Easter Week, apart from some forays to the GPO. This fact was unknown to the British authorities, who chose the building as the first to be shelled. It was seriously damaged by Royal Artillery units during the Rising, but was faithfully restored afterwards.

In the late 1950s Liberty Hall was declared unsafe and promptly demolished. The present building, which has sixteen stories, was constructed between 1961 and 1965. It was originally fitted with windows of non-reflective glass, but after they were damaged by a UVF car bomb on 1 December 1972 they were replaced with windows of reflective glass. The viewing platform, which had only recently been opened, was also closed after the car bomb.

In October 2006 it was announced that SIPTU (into which the Irish Transport and General Workers Union had merged in 1990) was seeking planning permission to demolish Liberty Hall and build a new headquarters on the same site. By October 2007 SIPTU had selected a shortlist of architects to design the new building and was planning to demolish the current building in 2009. In January 2008 the Dublin architects Gilroy MacMahon, who had designed the new stands at Croke Park, were chosen to design the new Liberty Hall. In February 2012 SIPTU was granted planning permission by Dublin City Council to demolish the present structure and build a 22-story replacement, with a height of about 100 meters. The new building would have included office space, a theatre and a &quot;heritage centre&quot;. However, in November 2012 the planning permission was overturned by An Bord Pleanála, which ruled unanimously that the new building would be &quot;unacceptably dominant in the city&quot;.

Liberty Hall was the subject of a documentary broadcast on RTÉ One in May 2009.

<doc id="613114" wikidata="Q5192191" url="?curid=613114" title="Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc.">
<text>Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc., 776 F. Supp. 135 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), was a 1991 court decision in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which held that Internet service providers were subject to traditional defamation law for their hosted content.

The case resolved a claim of libel against CompuServe, an Internet service provider that hosted allegedly defamatory content in one of its forums. The case established a precedent for Internet service provider liability by applying defamation law, originally intended for hard copies of written works, to the Internet medium. The court held that although CompuServe did host defamatory content on its forums, CompuServe was merely a distributor, rather than a publisher, of the content. As a distributor, CompuServe could only be held liable for defamation if it knew, or had reason to know, of the defamatory nature of the content. As CompuServe had made no effort to review the large volume of content on its forums, it could not be held liable for the defamatory content.

The application of traditional defamation law to the Internet context was soon to create controversy in &quot;Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.&quot;, in which a service provider was found liable for defamation on the grounds of good-faith attempts to filter objectionable content. In 1996, service providers were granted immunity as publishers and distributors by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as an incentive to moderate posted material.

== Facts ==
Cubby, Inc. and Robert Blanchard brought suit against CompuServe Inc. in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York in 1991 for libel, business disparagement, and unfair competition.

CompuServe, an Internet service provider, hosted an online news forum, the contents of which were generated by a contractor. Cameron Communications, Inc. agreed to &quot;manage, review, create, delete, edit, and otherwise control the contents&quot; of certain forums. Cameron Communications then subcontracted the production of Rumorville USA, a daily newsletter.

In April 1990, Rumorville published defamatory content about a competing online newsletter developed by Blanchard and Cubby, Inc. CompuServe did not dispute the defamatory nature of the content. However, no evidence presented during the trial demonstrated that CompuServe knew, or should have known, of the existence of the defamatory content.

==Legal proceedings==
Given the established facts, the court determined that a trial was unnecessary and granted summary judgment in favor of CompuServe for all claims.

=== Libel claim ===
Cubby alleged that CompuServe was the publisher of the defamatory statements. A &quot;publisher,&quot; in the context of defamation law, is one who publishes or otherwise republishes content. According to federal law and in agreement with New York state law, a publisher who repeats or republishes defamatory content has the same liability as the original publisher of the content.

CompuServe maintained that it was merely a distributor of the published statements. Distributors of defamatory content can only be held liable if they knew, or had reason to know, of the defamatory nature of the content. The court held that &quot;CompuServe has no more editorial control over such a publication [as Rumorville] than does a public library, book store, or newsstand, and it would be no more feasible for CompuServe to examine every publication it carries for potentially defamatory statements than it would be for any other distributor to do so.&quot;

===Business disparagement and unfair competition claims===
Both the business disparagement claim, which was viewed as trade libel, and the unfair competition claim, based on disparaging remarks, required that CompuServe knew or had reason to know of the defamatory remarks. Again, CompuServe was unaware of the nature of the statements and was thus not held liable.

== Impact ==
&quot;Cubby v. CompuServe&quot; treated internet intermediaries lacking editorial involvement as distributors, rather than publishers, in the context of defamation law. This decision removed any legal incentive for intermediaries to monitor or screen the content published on their domains.

In 1995, &quot;Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.&quot; further clarified Internet service providers&#x27; liabilities. Because Prodigy filtered and occasionally removed offensive content from bulletin boards that it hosted, the court held that Prodigy was a publisher of, and therefore liable for, published defamatory content. As these decisions were not appealed to higher level courts, they were not mandatory precedent. However, the incentive was clear: Internet service providers that chose to remain ignorant of their content were immune from liability, while those that edited content, even in good faith, assumed full publisher liability.

In 1996, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act granted Internet service providers immunity from liability for content provided by others, with certain exceptions. Section 230 distinguishes between interactive computer services, e.g. Internet service providers, and information content providers, e.g. users who post messages in forums. Interactive computer services are not considered publishers of content from information content providers and cannot be held liable on account of &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; attempts to filter objectionable content.

<doc id="613119" wikidata="Q6917473" url="?curid=613119" title="Mother lode">
<text>Mother lode is a principal vein or zone of gold or silver ore. The term is also used colloquially to refer to the real or imaginary origin of something valuable or in great abundance.

==Term==
The term probably came from a literal translation of the Spanish &quot;veta madre&quot;, a term common in old Mexican mining. &quot;Veta madre,&quot; for instance, is the name given to an silver vein discovered in 1548 in Guanajuato, New Spain (modern-day Mexico).

==California Mother Lode==
In the United States, &quot;Mother Lode&quot; is most famously the name given to a long alignment of hard-rock gold deposits stretching northwest-southeast in the Sierra Nevada of California, bounded on the east by the Melones Fault Zone. It was discovered in the early 1850s, during the California gold rush. The California Mother Lode is a zone from wide and long, between Georgetown on the north and Mormon Bar on the south. 

The Mother Lode coincides with the suture line of a terrane, the Smartville Block. The zone contains hundreds of mines and prospects, including some of the best-known historic mines of the gold-rush era. Individual gold deposits within the Mother Lode are gold-bearing quartz veins up to thick and a few thousand feet long. The California Mother Lode was one of the most productive gold-producing districts in the United States. Now it is known as a destination for tourism and for its vineyards.

As with most gold rushes, the California gold rush started with the discovery of placer gold in sands and gravels of streambeds, where the gold had eroded from hard-rock vein deposits. Placer miners followed the gold-bearing sands upstream to discover the source in the bedrock. This source was the &quot;mother&quot; of the gold in the river and so was dubbed the &quot;mother lode&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The term &quot;mother lode&quot; has appeared in some pop culture. For example: 

* &quot;Mother Lode&quot; (1982 film)
* A cheat code in &quot;The Sims&quot; which grants the player an additional 50,000 Simoleons (the in-game currency)
*A zone in &quot;World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth&quot; (styled as &quot;The MOTHERLODE!!&quot;).

==Also==
*Alaska Gold Rush (disambiguation)
*Gold Country

<doc id="613120" wikidata="Q7426759" url="?curid=613120" title="Saturday night special">
<text>Saturday night special is a colloquial term in the United States and Canada for inexpensive, compact, small-caliber handguns made of poor quality metal. Sometimes known as junk guns, some states define these guns by means of composition or material strength. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, they were commonly referred to as suicide specials.

==Definition==
The term &quot;Saturday night special&quot; refers to cheap guns used in poor neighborhoods. They are usually small, of small caliber, and often unreliable or inaccurate. A single definition is not easy to come by; while legislation in the United States has tried to define them as either &quot;unsafe&quot; or &quot;of no legitimate purpose&quot;, these attempts to define are problematic.

The earliest known use of the term &quot;Saturday night special&quot; in print is in the September 29, 1917, issue of &quot;The Coffeyville Daily Journal&quot;, referring to a &quot;cheap revolver&quot;. In its August 17, 1968, issue, &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed a front-page article titled &quot;Handgun Imports Held Up by U.S.&quot;, author Fred Graham wrote, &quot;... cheap, small-caliber &#x27;Saturday night specials&#x27; that are a favorite of holdup men...&quot;

The term &quot;Saturday night special&quot; came into wider use with the passing of the Gun Control Act of 1968 because the act banned the importation and manufacture of many inexpensive firearms, including a large number of revolvers made by Röhm Gesellschaft. With importation banned, Röhm opened a factory in Miami, Florida, and a number of companies in the United States began production of inexpensive handguns, including Raven Arms, Jennings Firearms, Phoenix Arms, Lorcin Engineering Company, Davis Industries, and Sundance Industries, which collectively came to be known as the &quot;Ring of Fire companies&quot;.

Gun ownership advocates describe legislation restricting inexpensive firearms as possibly discriminatory in origin, designed to target low income and black gun owners. In his book &quot;Restricting Handguns: The Liberal Skeptics Speak Out&quot;, gun rights advocate Don Kates found racial overtones in the focus on the Saturday night special.

==Issues==
===Criminal use statistics===

While Saturday night specials are commonly perceived as inexpensive, and therefore disposable after committing a crime, criminal behavior does not always conform to this expectation. A 1985 study of 1,800 incarcerated felons showed that criminals at the time preferred revolvers and other non-semi-automatic firearms over semi-automatic firearms. A change in preferences towards semi-automatic pistols occurred in the early 1990s, coinciding with the arrival of crack cocaine and rise of violent youth gangs.

Nonetheless, three of the top ten types of guns involved in crime (as represented by police trace requests) in the US are widely considered to be Saturday night specials; as reported by the ATF in 1993, these included the Raven Arms .25 ACP, Davis P-380 .380 ACP, and Lorcin L-380 .380 ACP. However, the same study showed the most common firearm used in homicides was a large-caliber revolver, and no revolvers of any kind appear on the top ten list of traced firearms.

===Availability===
In 2003, the NAACP filed suit against 45 gun manufacturers for creating what it called a &quot;public nuisance&quot; through the &quot;negligent marketing&quot; of handguns, which included models commonly described as Saturday night specials. The suit alleged that handgun manufacturers and distributors were guilty of marketing guns in a way that encouraged violence in black and Hispanic neighborhoods. The suit was dismissed by US District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who ruled that members of the NAACP were not &quot;uniquely harmed&quot; by illegal use of firearms and therefore had no standing to sue.

Proponents of gun ownership argue the elimination of inexpensive firearms limits constitutionally protected gun rights for those of lesser means. Roy Innis, former President of Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and a member of the National Rifle Association&#x27;s governing board, said &quot;to make inexpensive guns impossible to get is to say that you&#x27;re putting a money test on getting a gun. It&#x27;s racism in its worst form.&quot; CORE filed as an amicus curiae in a 1985 suit challenging Maryland&#x27;s Saturday night special/low-caliber handgun ban.

Peter Rossi and James D. Wright authored a study for the National Institute of Justice which suggested the ban on Saturday night specials was ineffective or counterproductive. A Cato Institute Policy analysis by Dave Kopel went further:

The people most likely to be deterred from acquiring a handgun by exceptionally high prices or by the nonavailability of certain kinds of handguns are not felons intent on arming themselves for criminal purposes, who are more likely to use stolen weapons, but rather poor people who have decided they need a gun to protect themselves against the felons but who find that the cheapest gun in the market costs more than they can afford to pay.
==Regulation==
===United States===


The earliest law prohibiting inexpensive handguns was enacted in Tennessee, in the form of the &quot;Army and Navy Law&quot;, passed in 1879, shortly after the 14th amendment and Civil Rights Act of 1875; previous laws invalidated by the constitutional amendment had stated that black freedmen could not own or carry any manner of firearm. The Army and Navy Law prohibited the sale of &quot;belt or pocket pistols, or revolvers, or any other kind of pistols, except army or navy pistols&quot;, which were prohibitively expensive for black freedmen and poor whites to purchase. These were large pistols in .36 caliber (&quot;navy&quot;) or .44 caliber (&quot;army&quot;), and were the military issue cap and ball black-powder revolvers used during the Civil War by both Union and Confederate ground troops. The effect of the law was to restrict handgun possession to the upper economic classes.

The next major attempt to regulate inexpensive firearms was the Gun Control Act of 1968, which used the &quot;sporting purposes&quot; test and a points system to exclude many small, inexpensive handguns which had been imported from European makers such as Röhm, located in Germany.

Most manufacturers in the US were not directly impacted by the Gun Control Act, as they were not subject to the import restrictions, and for the most part they did not manufacture compact, inexpensive handguns that competed with the banned imports. However, demand for inexpensive handguns still existed and a number of new companies were formed to fill that gap. In an effort to cut costs, many of these guns were made with cast components made of the zinc alloy zamak rather than the more typical machined or cast steel. As a result, legislation against &quot;junk guns&quot; subsequently targeted the zinc frames used in construction by specifying a melting point. The development of polymer-framed guns, which will burn at temperatures much lower than the commonly specified led to this becoming ineffective. Subsequent legislation regulated size (such as barrel lengths under ), materials (such as zinc), or low-cost manufacturing techniques (e.g., density requirements that specifically ban inexpensive powder cast metals), Some of these legal restrictions are based on product liability law.

===Canada===
In Canada, the 1995 Firearms Act (known as Bill C-68 before passage) classified handguns with a calibre of .25 or .32 (such as .25 ACP and .32 ACP), or having a barrel length of or shorter, as &quot;prohibited&quot; weapons. This provision appears to have been specifically aimed at &quot;Saturday night specials&quot;. Exceptions are made for target pistols in these calibres used in international shooting competitions.

<doc id="613154" wikidata="Q5295421" url="?curid=613154" title="Donation Land Claim Act">
<text>The Donation Land Claim Act of 1850, sometimes known as the Donation Land Act, was a statute enacted by the United States Congress in late 1850, intended to promote homestead settlements in the Oregon Territory. It followed the Distribution-Preemption Act 1841. The law, a forerunner of the later Homestead Act, brought thousands of settlers into the new territory, swelling their ranks along the Oregon Trail. 7,437 land patents were issued under the law, which expired in late 1855. The Donation Land Claim Act allowed white men or partial Native Americans (mixed with white) who had arrived in Oregon before 1850 to work on a piece of land for four years and legally claim the land for themselves.

Along with other US land grant legislation, the Donation Land Claim Act discriminated against nonwhite settlers and had the effect of dispossessing land from Native Americans.

==History==
The passage of the law was largely due to the efforts of Samuel R. Thurston, the Oregon territorial delegate to Congress. The act, which became law on 27 September 1850, granted of designated areas free of charge to every unmarried white male citizen eighteen or older and to every married couple arriving in the Oregon Territory before 1 December 1850. In the case of a married couple, the husband and wife each owned half of the land under their own name. The law was one of the first that allowed married women in the United States to hold property under their own name. American &quot;half-breed Indians&quot; were also eligible for the grant. A provision in the law granted half the amount to those who arrived after the 1850 deadline but before 1854. Claimants were required to live on the land and to cultivate it for four years to gain ownership title to it.

==Limitations==
The provisional government formed at Champoeg had limited the land claims offered in the hope of preventing land speculation. The Organic Act of the Oregon Territory had granted 640 acres (1 square mile, 2.6 km2) to each married couple. The new law voided the previous statutes but essentially continued the same policy and was worded in such a way as to legitimize existing claims. One such claim legitimized by the act was that of George Abernethy, who had been elected to the governorship in the days of the provisional government. His claim became famous for Abernethy Green, where new emigrants camped at the end of the Oregon Trail while seeking a piece of land for themselves.

==Details==
Claims under the law were granted at the federal land office in Oregon City. The most famous patent granted at the Oregon City Land Office was the plat for the city of San Francisco, which had to be sent up the coast from California by ship. The claims of the land were surveyed by the Surveyor General of Oregon, an office created out of the law. As part of the general survey, the Willamette Stone was placed just west of Portland, defining the Willamette Meridian.

==Final year and aftermath==
After the 1855 cutoff date, the designated land in Oregon was no longer free but was still available, selling at $1.25 an acre ($3.09/hectare), with a limit of 320 acres (1.3 km2) in any one claim. The law expired on December 1, 1855. In the following years, the price was raised and the maximum size of claims was progressively lowered. The government&#x27;s only goal was to raise the population in that area.

In 1862, Congress passed the first of the &quot;Homestead Acts&quot;, which were largely designed to encourage settlement of the Great Plains states but applied to Oregon as well.

<doc id="613157" wikidata="Q964726" url="?curid=613157" title="Euphoria (Def Leppard album)">
<text>Euphoria is the seventh studio album by English rock band Def Leppard, released on 8 June 1999 in the United States and on 14 June 1999 in the United Kingdom by Mercury Records. The album aimed to return to their signature sound made famous by the band in the 1980s. It was produced by the band with Pete Woodroffe. The album charted at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 11 on the UK Albums Chart. It includes the song &quot;Promises&quot;, which hit the number one spot on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart.

==Overview==
Following &quot;Slang&quot;, the band was initially unsure of which direction to take upon reconvening in April 1998. &quot;We just let ourselves go in any way we wanted,&quot; recalled Joe Elliott. With &quot;Slang&quot; we did: we said we&#x27;re not gonna do the typical Def Leppard things. But with &quot;Euphoria&quot; we didn&#x27;t rule them out… because it had been eight [sic] years since &quot;Adrenalize&quot;. That&#x27;s a long time to have abandoned your main style of music. So we embraced it.&quot;

Former producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange returned for four days. &quot;It was a bit weird, because he wasn&#x27;t working the same way,&quot; recalled Elliott. &quot;He wasn&#x27;t hands-on. He was more observant. He&#x27;d say, &#x27;Stop,&#x27; and make a suggestion… We also wrote another song where we did kind of start from scratch. We said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s do something really off the wall.&#x27; That ended up being the song &#x27;All Night&#x27; – all groovy noises and orgasmic songs.&quot; Three songs were co-written with Lange, who performed backing vocals (as he had on other albums): &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot;, &quot;All Night&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot;.

A song first recorded by Vivian Campbell&#x27;s side band Clock, &quot;To Be Alive&quot;, received a Leppard makeover. For the first time since 1981&#x27;s &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot;, an instrumental was included: Phil Collen&#x27;s &quot;Disintegrate&quot;. This instrumental was known before as &quot;Spanish Sky&quot;, a ballad that evolved into this track.

1996 Formula One racing champion Damon Hill, a neighbour of Rick Savage, would contribute a guitar solo to the track &quot;Demolition Man&quot;.

In its first week of release, &quot;Euphoria&quot; sold over 98,000 units in the US and just missed the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching No. 11. First single &quot;Promises&quot; topped &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart in June 1999, a spot the band had not held in six years.

&quot;Euphoria&quot; would later be certified gold in the US, Canada and Japan. The album-supporting tour stretched from May 1999 to September 2000.

The album was released for the first time on vinyl on 21 June 2019, as a part of &quot;The Collection: Volume 2&quot; box set. It was then issued on its own in 2022.

==Reception==
&quot;Euphoria&quot; received fairly positive reviews. Rating the album 4 out of 5, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic notes in his retrospective assessment that despite the band returning to their signature sound &quot;no longer guarantees a hit at the close of the &#x27;90s&quot;, &quot;Euphoria&quot; is &quot;a tight, attractive album with more than its share of big hooks, strong riffs, and memorable melodies.&quot; He concludes by saying that &quot;what&#x27;s best about &quot;Euphoria&quot; is that it&#x27;s utterly not self-conscious. Def Leppard feels free to try straight pop, appropriate Gary Glitter riffs, or play straight metal, without caring whether it&#x27;s hip or commercial. That doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;Euphoria&quot; is a classic, but it does mean that it&#x27;s their most appealing effort in over a decade.&quot;

Greg Kot of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, however, was more critical. He notes that &quot;the defining characteristic of &quot;Euphoria&quot; is its bloodlessness, from the robotic drum tracks to the disconcertingly inhuman tone of those trademark massed vocal choruses&quot;, concluding that &quot;the flesh-and-blood Def Leppard apparently never made it out of the Eighties alive.&quot;

<text>The MacCready &quot;Gossamer Condor&quot; was the first human-powered aircraft capable of controlled and sustained flight; as such, it won the Kremer prize in 1977. Its design was led by Paul MacCready of AeroVironment, Inc.

==Design and development==

The Kremer Prize had been set up in 1959 by Henry Kremer, a British industrialist, and offered £50,000 in prize money to the first group that could fly a human-powered aircraft over a figure-eight course covering a total of one mile (1.6 kilometers). The course also included a ten-foot pole that the aircraft had to fly over at the start and at the end. Early attempts to build human-powered aircraft had focused on wooden designs, which proved too heavy. Very early attempts – notably the &quot;&quot; and &quot;Pedaliante&quot; – used catapult launches.

In 1961, Southampton University&#x27;s Man Powered Aircraft SUMPAC took to the air at Lasham Airfield on 9 November, piloted by Derek Piggott, achieving a maximum flight of . One week later, on 16 November, the Hatfield Puffin flew, and eventually managed a maximum flight of but it was difficult to turn. The Jupiter managed in June 1972. The Nihon Stork B achieved over in 1976.

In the early 1970s, Paul MacCready and Peter B. S. Lissaman, both of AeroVironment Inc., took a fresh look at the challenge and came up with an unorthodox aircraft, the &quot;Gossamer Condor&quot;. He took his inspiration from hang gliders, increasing wing area so that the drag of the wire bracing needed would be reduced. The &quot;Gossamer Condor&quot; is built around a large wing with a gondola for the pilot underneath and a canard control surface on a fuselage extension in front, and is mostly built of lightweight plastics with aluminum spars.

==Operational history==
The &quot;Gossamer Condor&quot; evolved over a period of time through three distinct versions. The first version, known by MacCready as the Pasadena version, was a proof-of-concept aircraft which flew only once, in the parking lot of the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The first aircraft carrying the name &quot;Gossamer Condor&quot; was known as the Mojave version, without pilot fairings and other niceties, flown at Mojave airport by MacCready&#x27;s sons on 26 December 1976. The record-breaking version, known as the Shafter version, included improvements such as a pilot nacelle and double-skin airfoil sections, allowing the aircraft to fly long distances as well as maneuver.

The aircraft, piloted by amateur cyclist and hang-glider pilot Bryan Allen, won the first Kremer prize on August 23, 1977, by completing a figure-eight course specified by the Royal Aeronautical Society, at Minter Field in Shafter, California. It was capable of taking off under human power.

On September 22, 1977, Maude Oldershaw, wife of the chief construction engineer Vern Oldershaw, became the first female to pilot a human-powered airplane under her own power.

The aircraft is preserved at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

The success led Paul MacCready and AeroVironment to carry on with experimental aircraft: the &quot;Gossamer Albatross&quot;, which crossed the English Channel; the Solar Challenger, a solar electric-powered version that also made an English Channel crossing; and NASA&#x27;s Pathfinder/Helios series of unmanned solar-powered aircraft.

<text>Chris Owens (October 5, 1932 – April 5, 2022) was an American performer, club owner and entrepreneur who based her act out of the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the United States. She was a French Quarter fixture and celebrity from the start of the 1960s through the early 21st century. Owens was well known in Louisiana and throughout the South. Tourists visiting Bourbon Street could not miss huge posters of her wearing costumes as they walked by her nightclub. Owens was known as &quot;Queen of the Vieux Carré&quot;.

==Life and work==

Chris Owens was born Christine Joetta Shaw on October 5, 1932, in rural Texas, the daughter of Fred Moore Shaw Sr. and Thelma Leona Martin who married in 1925 in Haskell, Texas. Owens grew up on a farm and went to Texas Wesleyan College (now Texas Wesleyan University) to be a nurse. She married car dealer Sol R. Owens in 1956 and opened a nightclub on St. Louis Street in the French Quarter; it was originally intended to be a low-key sideline establishment, but business exploded. Realizing that Owens&#x27; performance numbers were a huge draw, they sold their home in 1977 and purchased the building on the corner of St. Louis and Bourbon. Soon the &quot;Chris Owens Review&quot; became a noted act in town. In 1979, Sol had a heart attack and died; Owens took over management of the club and of the 30 apartments and four shops located within the building.

Owens hosted a yearly Easter Parade that continues to roll throughout the French Quarter.

Owens can be seen in the 1962 film &quot;The Wacky World of Doctor Morgus&quot; (see Morgus the Magnificent). She began production in 2003 of her first feature film, &quot;Let&#x27;s Ballroom&quot;, in which she stars as a wealthy widow who falls in love with her dance instructor.

==Death==
Chris Owens died of a heart attack on April 5, 2022, in her St. Louis Street apartment, according to her longtime manager Kitsy Adams.

==Honors==
On April 22, 2006, Owens was inducted into the New Orleans Musical Legends Park with a statue created in her likeness. Her image stands next to others including Fats Domino, Pete Fountain, Allen Toussaint, Irma Thomas, Al Hirt, Ronnie Kole, and Louis Prima.

<text>Jung Yunho (; born February 6, 1986), better known by his stage name U-Know Yunho () or simply U-Know, is a South Korean singer-songwriter, actor, and a member of the pop duo TVXQ. Born and raised in Gwangju, South Korea, Yunho started his musical training under the talent agency SM Entertainment in 2001 and joined TVXQ in 2003 as the band&#x27;s leader. Fluent in Korean and Japanese, Yunho has released chart-topping albums throughout Asia as a member of TVXQ. He has made occasional acting appearances in television dramas.

==Early life==
Yunho was born and raised in Gwangju, South Korea. He has one younger sister. Several members of Yunho&#x27;s family worked in the legal industry, and Yunho&#x27;s own childhood dream was to be a prosecutor.

When he was in middle school, he and a few other friends formed the dance team A+, and they competed in various dance competitions around the country. After winning a prize at the 1st Annual SM Best Competition in 1999, Yunho signed with S.M. Entertainment and officially started his training in 2001.

His family, who suffered greatly from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, were initially against his decision to become a singer. To provide for himself while he trained in Seoul, Yunho took up various part-time jobs in the city, such as doing snow removal in the morning and working as a waiter at night. He spent most of his high school vacations in Seoul training and only returned to Gwangju for school. Sometime later, Yunho suffered a hormonal imbalance in his throat and underwent surgery, which affected his vocal cords. After losing his voice, Yunho considered giving up his training.

Throughout his years as a trainee, Yunho was put in four temporary groups—all of which later disbanded. In late 2001, at the age of fifteen, Yunho was featured as a rapper and backup dancer in Dana&#x27;s debut single &quot;Diamond&quot;, and briefly toured with her.

In 2002, Yunho was selected to be a backup dancer for Shinhwa and was chosen to be part of the project boy band Four Seasons, which consisted of fellow trainees Kim Jae-joong, Kim Hee-chul, and Kangin. The project group was dropped when Yunho and Jaejoong joined TVXQ in early 2003.

Yunho&#x27;s stage name &quot;U-Know&quot;, a nickname he has been using since high school, reflected Yunho&#x27;s position as the leader, who was always trying to understand others.

==Music career==
===TVXQ===
The final line-up of TVXQ consisted of Yunho, Max Changmin, Jaejoong, Park Yoo-chun, and Kim Jun-su. The group officially debuted on December 26, 2003, during a BoA and Britney Spears showcase. They performed their debut single &quot;Hug&quot;, which became a hit in South Korea. TVXQ have been releasing number one albums in Korea since their second studio album &quot;Rising Sun&quot; (2005), which was also the album that gave the group their first Daesang (대상), or Grand Award, at the Mnet KM Music Festival. Their fourth Korean album &quot;Mirotic&quot; (2008) was the Album of the Year at the 2008 Mnet KM Music Festival and the 2008 Golden Disc Awards. The album features the group&#x27;s most well-known and best-selling single, &quot;Mirotic&quot;.

In 2005, TVXQ made their Japanese debut with the single &quot;Stay with Me Tonight&quot;, debuting at number 37 on the Oricon Singles Chart. They grabbed their first number-one single in Japan with &quot;Purple Line&quot; (2008). Their fourth Japanese album &quot;The Secret Code&quot; spawned two platinum-selling singles &quot;Dōshite Kimi o Suki ni Natte Shimattandarō?&quot; and Share the World&quot; (2009), with the latter being a theme song for the anime &quot;One Piece&quot;.

TVXQ was plunged into legal turmoil when members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu filed an injunction against their Korean agency in July 2009. This led to their much-publicized departure from the group in 2010. A year later, Yunho and Changmin returned as a duo, releasing albums in both Korean and Japanese. As a duo, TVXQ set sales records and concert attendance records in Japan, becoming the country&#x27;s best-selling and highest-grossing foreign music act.

===Cyanoacrylate drink poisoning===
While TVXQ was filming a variety show on October 14, 2006, Yunho was rushed to the hospital after drinking a beverage laced with super glue, given to him by an anti-fan. The female suspect, whose surname is Ko, was apprehended on October 16. She was a member of an anti-TVXQ website for over two years.

Yunho contacted the police and requested to not press charges against Ko in spite of the potentially severe consequences of what she did. Ko was the same age as Yunho&#x27;s younger sister, and Yunho stated that the entire event &quot;affected [him] more mentally than physically&quot; while he was recovering from the shock. Circumstances were unclear as to how the culprit managed to enter the set of the variety show.

<doc id="613245" wikidata="Q2820648" url="?curid=613245" title="New Melleray Abbey">
<text>New Melleray Abbey (Abbey of Our Lady of New Melleray) is a Trappist monastery located near Dubuque, Iowa. The abbey is located about 15 miles southwest of Dubuque and is in the Archdiocese of Dubuque. Currently the Abbey is home to about 16 monks. Several of the monks work in their business, Trappist Caskets, and some of their food comes from the garden behind the Abbey. The superior of the monastery is Dom Brendan Freeman, who was appointed by Father Immediate McCarthy in December 2021 after consulting the community.

==History==
The Abbey was founded on July 16, 1849, when the first six monks arrived from Mount Melleray Abbey to the present site of the abbey. This was after the Trappists were invited to settle in the area at the invitation of Bishop Matthias Loras. When the first six brothers finished a temporary building, 16 more monks came to live at New Melleray. On September 18, 1849, sixteen others left Ireland and in November sailed up the Mississippi from New Orleans. Cholera broke out on the steamer the group took up the Mississippi river and, within a week, six of the monks died.

The monastery&#x27;s first two priors, Clement Smyth, O.C.S.O. and James O&#x27;Gorman, O.C.S.O., were both later named bishops.

After the close of the American Civil War, the present stone structure was built. The plans were drawn up by John Mullany, a prominent Dubuque architect who had designed several Dubuque area churches. The monastery was built in a 13th Century Gothic Revival style.

Since the founding of the monastery in 1849, the monks have served the religious needs of the surrounding region. When the pioneers living in the area felt the need to build their own parish church, the monks provided pastors to the parish for over 100 years, and relatives of one monk provided funds to the parish. In 1889, the present parish church was dedicated, and named Holy Family.

The Abbey has been remodeled several times. One of the most notable projects was the completion of the Abbey&#x27;s chapel. Because of financial concerns, the Abbey&#x27;s chapel was not completed as originally envisioned by the architect. It had originally been on the second floor of the east wing, then was moved in 1920 to the second floor of the north wing. In the 1970s, the abbey was able to convert the entire north wing of the Abbey into a permanent chapel. The chapel features a very simple and very elegant design. Red oak is used in the choir stalls, doors, Eucharistic chapel, and other furnishings. The altar was made of granite that had been quarried in Minnesota, and it weighs five tons. Designed by Architect Willoughby Marshall, Inc, with construction supervised by Twin Cities-based Hammel, Green and Abrahamson, the new chapel received a prestigious national Honor Award (1977) from the American Institute of Architects.

In 2003, the Abbey embarked on rebuilding an infirmary for the elderly and sick monks. This was completed in 2004 with the help of generous donations by friends and benefactors. It had become even more important as the average age of the monks is now above 70. The Abbey did build an infirmary in the 1950s, but it had become outdated, thus the new infirmary was constructed to take better care of the members of the community.

The Traveler&#x27;s Chapel at Wall Drug in Wall, South Dakota is based on the chapel at New Melleray.

== Monastic life ==
The monks have a daily routine that involves spending a large part of their day in prayer, work, and contemplation. In keeping with ancient monastic traditions, they begin their day with Vigils at 3:30 AM, and end their days at 7:30 PM with Compline. As of 2020, there were twenty-two monks in residence at New Melleray.

New Melleray makes its Guest House available to people who would like to make quiet, personal retreats. However, in April 2020, the church and guest house were closed so as not to contribute to the spread of the coronavirus. The Guesthouse has since reopened for retreats.

===Trappist caskets===
The Abbey is well known for crafting high-quality wooden caskets, coffins, and urns. They do not use the caskets for deceased monks, however, as they observe burial traditions spelled out in the Rule of Saint Benedict, which requires the body be placed in the ground on a bier. Former Dubuque Archbishop James Byrne was buried in a casket made by the Abbey, while Cardinal Roger Mahony has reserved a casket for his own eventual use. Actress Kate Mulgrew, a native of Dubuque, made a radio commercial for New Melleray&#x27;s casket business.

<text>The Prince Edward Island Railway (PEIR) was a historic Canadian railway in Prince Edward Island (PEI). The railway ran tip-to-tip on the island, from Tignish in the west to Elmira in the east, with major spurs serving Borden-Carleton&#x27;s train ferry dock, the capital in Charlottetown, Montague and Georgetown and the original eastern terminus at Souris. A major spur from Charlottetown served Murray Harbour on the south coast.

Construction began in 1871 but costs almost bankrupted the government by the next year, a problem that helped pave PEI&#x27;s entrance into Confederation. The work was picked up by the Canadian Government Railways and largely completed by the mid-1880s. The PEIR saw heavy use, especially during World War II, but like many railways saw declining use through the 1970s. The line officially closed on 31 December 1989 and the rails removed between 1990 and 1992, with the provincial government receiving a one-time payment of $200 million to upgrade the road network in exchange for not opposing the closure.

The provincial government purchased the properties in 1994, and 75 per cent of the route now forms the basis of the Confederation Trail rail trail system. The station in Elmira at the eastern end of the line is now used as the Elmira Railway Museum.

==History==

===Construction===
Located wholly within the province of Prince Edward Island, construction of the PEIR started in 1871, eventually financed by Canada. The line was initially built to gauge, under the supervision of Chief Engineer John Edward Boyd a native of Saint John, New Brunswick who first advocated the use of narrow gauge for the New Brunswick Railway in the 1860s, and was responsible for the first surveys of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway in Ontario. The PEIR was frequently criticized for its meandering path, reputedly caused by construction contractors who were paid by the mile; this may also be accounted for in economies taken by reducing the amount of grading and trenching required by going around hills and obstacles. At one point there was on average one railway station for every of track. The main line connected the northwestern port of Alberton (later extended to Tignish) with the Northumberland Strait ports of Summerside, Charlottetown, Georgetown, and Souris. By 1872, construction debts threatened to bankrupt the colony.

===Confederation===
The United Kingdom had consistently encouraged the small colony to enter into Canadian Confederation, something which it had been avoiding since playing host to the Charlottetown Conference a decade earlier. The railway construction debts pushed the colony into reconsidering Confederation, and following further negotiations, Prince Edward Island became a province of Canada on July 1, 1873.

The understated provision in the &quot;Prince Edward Island Terms of Union&quot; reads as follows:

&quot;That the railways under contract and in course of construction for the Government of the Island, shall be the property of Canada;&quot;

===Canadian Government Railways===
Thus the Government of Canada came to inherit the PEIR in 1874 at the same time as construction was progressing on the Intercolonial Railway (IRC), which would link the strategic winter ports of the Canadian Maritimes with Central Canada. New locomotives were purchased from the United Kingdom and from Canadian manufacturers along with new rail cars.

In 1885, a new line was built connecting the Charlottetown-Summerside main line at Emerald Junction with another Northumberland Strait port at Cape Traverse. From Cape Traverse, iceboats would cross the Abegweit Passage to Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick during the winter months.

Another new line was built east from Charlottetown to Murray Harbour, part of which included building the Hillsborough River Bridge, using a former IRC bridge over the Miramichi River at Newcastle, New Brunswick. Branches were also constructed at this time off PEIR lines to Vernon Bridge, Montague, and Elmira.

From 1915 to 1918, PEIR and IRC would come to be known collectively as the Canadian Government Railways (CGR), although each company would maintain its separate corporate identity and management.

The most revolutionary change to the PEIR occurred in 1915 when a new icebreaking railcar ferry called &quot;Prince Edward Island&quot; was ordered by the federal government, arriving from the United Kingdom with a capacity of 12 rail cars, however it would not be until 1917 that the port facilities at Port Borden and Cape Tormentine would be ready to handle the vessel. In the meantime, the &quot;Prince Edward Island&quot; continued to operate the service to the port of Pictou, Nova Scotia from Georgetown and Charlottetown for the next two years.

The new ferry port at Borden required the Cape Traverse-Emerald Junction line be modified, and a line was constructed to Borden, along with marshalling yards and other facilities. The Cape Traverse line would only last a few more years before being abandoned following the move to Borden. Up until this point, the PEIR was a completely captive system, having no need for interchange with mainland North American railways. Following the start of railcar service in 1917, the lines to Charlottetown and Summerside from Borden were &quot;dual-gauged&quot;, capable of handling mainland cars with the standard gauge of and the PEIR&#x27;s narrow gauge of .

===Canadian National Railways===
In September 1918, management of CGR (including PEIR) was transferred to the newly nationalized Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR). These companies were assumed by a new Crown corporation established by the federal government in December 1918, called Canadian National Railways (CNR). By 1923 all corporate entities ceased to exist under CNR.

Soon after CNR took over, it was decided to standard gauge all narrow gauge trackage on Prince Edward Island. This was completed from Tignish to Charlottetown by 1924, and remaining lines in the east end of the province were completed by 1926 except for the Murray Harbour line which was standard gauged by September 1930.

The last significant railway construction on Prince Edward Island occurred during the early 1930s when the Hillsborough River Bridge carrying the Murray Harbour line over the Hillsborough River was unable to handle the heavier standard gauge cars, thus a connecting track called the &quot;Short Line&quot; was built from a point at Maple Hill Junction on the Mount Stewart Jct.-Georgetown line, to connect with the Murray Harbour track at Lake Verde Junction. In 1951, the Hillsborough River bridge was deemed too weak to carry even the lightest engines and cars, thus the trackage was removed and trains trying to reach Southport on the opposite side of Charlottetown Harbour would have to run over via Mount Stewart Junction and the &quot;Short Line&quot;.

CNR was busy on Prince Edward Island during the Second World War when a spur line was built from St. Eleanors, west of Summerside, to service a new air force base (CFB Summerside), and the railway was pressed into service to supply a radar base in Tignish, as well as a flight training school in Mount Pleasant, midway between Summerside and Tignish.

Increased use of diesel locomotives in North America during and after the Second World War saw CNR completely dieselize its operations on Prince Edward Island by the late 1940s as a means to save money on hauling bulk coal to the province. This meant that Prince Edward Island rail lines had diesel locomotives fully one decade before the rest of Canada saw the last of steam, giving the province a prominent place in Canadian railway history as one of the first regional dieselization projects.

===Rise of automobiles and trucks===
The rising popularity of automobiles travelling on government-funded all-weather highways saw passenger rail traffic decline sharply during the 1950s and into the 1960s. The last passenger train on Prince Edward Island operated in 1968, being replaced by buses thereafter.

CN (name change to Canadian National Railway or acronym CN in 1960) was a major presence in Prince Edward Island&#x27;s economy, from operating the freight and passenger railway (and later bus) services, to a large fleet of company owned and operated ferries. The ferry system was noteworthy by the fact that it was mandated by Prince Edward Island&#x27;s &quot;Terms of Union&quot; under the British North America Act of Canadian Confederation, to provide &quot;efficient steamship service.&quot; This required the use of icebreakers, some of which were the largest of their kind in the world at one time.

===Decline===
Trucks soon began to take traffic away from freight operations on Prince Edward Island, particularly as CNR improved the ferry system to accept more road vehicles. By the 1970s, critical agricultural cargo such as the potato harvests were increasingly transferring to trucks with each successive season. As a result, CN increasingly began to avoid investing capital into improving railway infrastructure in the province. In a classic &quot;demarketing&quot; strategy, CN&#x27;s deteriorating track conditions resulted in further loss of service to trucks.

By the early 1980s CN made it clear the days of its railway operations on Prince Edward Island were numbered, but Island politicians at the provincial and federal level managed to dissuade CN from abandoning. The renewed talk of a fixed link in 1985–1986, following aborted attempts at building a highway/railway causeway across Abegweit Passage in 1957 and 1965–1969, saw CN accelerate its attempts to withdraw railway service on Prince Edward Island.

===Preservation===
In 1975 the railway station in Elmira was re-opened to become the Island&#x27;s first railway museum. The museum is housed in the actual Elmira railway station. The museum originally included two former Canadian National Railway passenger cars: one former wood sided baggage car and a steel railway post office (RPO) car. In the 1990s arson claimed the baggage car. Approximately a decade later, RPO was scrapped having succumbed to age and a lack of preservation activities. The trucks from the baggage car are still on the property. Several railway cars were on display at the provincially operated railway museum at Elmira until the mid-2000s but have since been scrapped due to neglect on the part of the PEI Museum &amp; Heritage Foundation. An ex-CN caboose 78431 was acquired and moved to museum in 2009.

In 1990, a diesel locomotive (class MLW RSC-14 number 1767) donated to Summerside several years earlier, needed to be moved to nearby Kensington. Although now abandoned, the railway&#x27;s tracks were still intact between both locations, except for several grade crossings at local roads where rails had been removed. The locomotive was towed by construction machinery across temporary tracks built over these roads to its new location, where it remains on display as part of a community-operated railway museum. The former Kensington Railway Station was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

Another railway car is currently undergoing preservation at Borden-Carleton. This car is a plywood sided, former CNR, caboose and is located adjacent to a replica railway station. Both can be seen from the Confederation Bridge.

Two former railway tank cars reside beside the railway on the property of Island Construction on the Sherwood Road in Charlottetown. Both tank cars are adjacent to the railway trail can be easily seen and photographed from the trail. These tank cars are 36&#x27; long each. During the final years of railway operation on PEI these tank cars could be seen parked in the Borden railway yard and were used to store fuel oil for the ferry boats. Both tank cars are painted a light blue colour (the same paint scheme they featured during their railway service).

==Route==
The western end of the PEIR starts in Tignish, abutting Church Street which forms the downtown axis. A wye-junction just west of the end serves as a turnaround, running north to Maple Street. The line initially runs west-southwest out of town but soon turns south towards the northern edge of the original western terminus of the line at Alberton. Here the line folds back on itself, leaving town west-northwest almost parallel to the incoming line, an artifact of its later extension. The line originally bent south to run through town to the docks at Northport. The line to Northport was turned into a spur by building a large wye junction at the sharp curve that developed when the extension was added.

The line continues westward, avoiding Cascumpec Bay, which extends inland to the west for some distance. This takes the line through Elmsdale and O&#x27;Leary, where it starts bending back toward the east and south, running through Wellington (and forming Wellington Station). Here it turns east to Summerside. Just west of Summerside a wye was built to provide a spur line to service Summerside Airport, running along the eastern side of the airport.

The line continues eastward out of Summerside to the New Annan area, where several large potato processing factories were built. Today this is the site of major factories for Cavendish Farms, which runs two dozen factories in this area. The line runs through Kensington and then turns south to Emerald Junction, where a wye junction splits off a spur leading southwest to Borden-Carleton, serving the former ferry docks. The line continues east from the junction, running east and south to Royalty Junction, just north of Charlottetown. Here a wye formed a spur serving the downtown area.

The line continues away from Charlottetown running east-northeast to Mount Stewart, where it splits in a wye just west of town. The mainline continues northeast, while a major spur bends south and then southwest for the run to Montague Junction. Here a wye forms a spur running southwest to Montague and southeast and Georgetown. The mainline continues out of Mount Stewart and passes through Morell, and, on the eastern side of town, begins to parallel the northern coast of the island as far as Saint Peter&#x27;s Bay. Here it leaves the coast and continues eastward to a wye at Harmony Junction, where it originally looped back westward and then south for the short run to Souris. The Harmony wye made the Souris line a spur, with the mainline continuing east to its ultimate end in Elmira. Like the western end, a wye junction and spur just west of Elmira allowed the trains to turn around.

The Murray Harbour Line started at the end of the mainline spur in Charlottetown, crossing the Hillsborough River Bridge (the original pilings can still be seen) before bending sharply to the northeast through Bunbury. From here it runs roughly eastward to Lake Verde, where a wye provides a spur running south a short distance to a large turning loop at Vernon Bridge. With the closing of the Hillsborough bridge, a second wye was added just to the east of the first, spurring off the Short Line that runs northward to meet the Montague/Georgetown spur just south of Mount Stewart, near Maple Hill. The mainline of the Murray Harbour Line continues eastward a short distance before turning south at Hermitage, and then eastward again when it meets the Belle River on the south coast, running the remaining distance to Murray Harbour. A spur was later added in the Belle River area to Wood Islands. This collection of spurs on the PEIR is the only area that has not been fully converted to rail trail use, with several sections currently undeveloped.

Like many lines of the era, small whistle-stop towns sprang up all along the line, typically where the railway crossed an existing road. These often bear the terms &quot;Junction&quot;, &quot;Crossing&quot; or &quot;Station&quot; as part of their names. Many of these exist only as names on a map today, the dwellings long since gone.

Due to its relatively recent abandonment, and especially due to maintenance as part of the rail trail conversion, the route of PEIR remains easily visible in aerial and satellite photos.

<text>An aubade is a morning love song (as opposed to a serenade, intended for performance in the evening), or a song or poem about lovers separating at dawn. It has also been defined as &quot;a song or instrumental composition concerning, accompanying, or evoking daybreak&quot;.

In the strictest sense of the term, an aubade is a song sung by a departing lover to a sleeping woman. Aubades are generally conflated with what are strictly called albas, which are exemplified by a dialogue between parting lovers, a refrain with the word &quot;alba&quot;, and a watchman warning the lovers of the approaching dawn.

The tradition of &quot;aubades&quot; goes back at least to the troubadours of the Provençal schools of courtly love in the High Middle Ages.
The aubade gained in popularity again with the advent of the metaphysical fashion in the 17th century. John Donne&#x27;s poem &quot;The Sunne Rising&quot; exemplifies an aubade in English. Aubades were written from time to time in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 20th century the focus of the aubade shifted from the genre&#x27;s original specialized courtly-love context into the more generalized theme of a human parting at daybreak. In this reformulated context several notable aubades were published in the 20th century, such as &quot;Aubade&quot; by Philip Larkin. French composers of the turn of the 20th century wrote a number of aubades. In 1883, the French composer Emmanuel Chabrier composed an &quot;Aubade&quot; for piano solo, inspired by a four-month visit to Spain. Maurice Ravel included a Spain-inspired aubade entitled &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot; in his 1906 piano suite &quot;Miroirs&quot;. An aubade is the centerpiece of Erik Satie&#x27;s 1915 piano suite &quot;Avant-dernières pensées&quot;. The composer Francis Poulenc later wrote (in concerto form) a piece titled &quot;Aubade&quot;; it premiered in 1929.

In 2014 postmodern dancer and choreographer Douglas Dunn presented a piece titled &quot;Aubade&quot;, with costumes, video and lighting by Charles Atlas, and poetry by Anne Waldman.

Montreal pop-composer Jean-Michel Blais&#x27; 2022 album, Aubades, is inspired by the theme.

<doc id="613257" wikidata="Q2825375" url="?curid=613257" title="Advanced Photon Source">
<text>The Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (in Lemont, Illinois) is a storage-ring-based high-energy X-ray light source facility. It is one of five X-ray light sources owned and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. The APS began operation on March 26, 1995. It is operated as a user facility, meaning that it is open to the world’s scientific community, and more than 5,500 researchers make use of its resources each year.

==How APS works==

The APS uses a series of particle accelerators to push electrons up to nearly the speed of light, and then injects them into a storage ring that is roughly two-thirds of a mile around. At every bend in the track, these electrons emit synchrotron radiation in the form of ultrabright X-rays. Scientists at 65 experiment stations around the ring use these X-rays for basic and applied research in a number of fields.

Scientists use the X-rays generated by the APS to peer inside batteries, with the goal of creating longer-lasting, faster-charging energy storage devices; to improve 3D printing for more durable materials; to learn more about the behavior of charged particles in order to improve electronics; and to map the brain to understand more about neurological diseases. APS research played a role in the development of the COVID-19 vaccines in use in the United States.

The Experiment Hall surrounds the storage ring and is divided into 35 sectors, each of which has access to x-ray beamlines, one at an insertion device, and the other at a bending magnet. Each sector also corresponds to a lab/office module offering immediate access to the beamline.

Two Nobel prizes in Chemistry have been granted for work performed in part at the APS. The 2009 prize was awarded for the discovery of the structure of the ribosome, and the 2012 prize for the structure of G protein-coupled receptors.

== APS upgrade ==
The APS underwent an upgrade that saw the original storage ring replaced with a new multi-bend achromat lattice. Construction of nine new feature beamlines and 15 enhanced existing beamlines will be completed in 2024 and 2025. The result will be X-rays that are up to 500 times brighter than those currently generated, and beamlines that will enable greater focusing ability to examine smaller materials in sharper detail. The installation period for the new storage ring began on April 24, 2023, and was completed roughly 12 months later in 2024, with stored beam demonstrated April 20, 2024.

<text>Lorraine P. Segato (born June 17, 1956, in Hamilton, Ontario) is a Canadian pop singer-songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist for and a principal songwriter of new wave and pop rock group The Parachute Club, with which she continues to perform.

== History ==

Segato initially became known in the late 1970s as the vocalist in the Toronto rock band Mama Quilla II. This band formed the core membership of The Parachute Club. The Parachute Club was particularly active in the 1980s, initially breaking up in 1989. Segato co-wrote nearly every song the band released, including all their singles. A reconstituted version of the band, including Segato, commenced performing in 2005 and continued to perform somewhat sporadically through 2014. After the initial break-up of Parachute Club, Segato released a solo album, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, in 1990.

In 1990 she collaborated on the one-off single &quot;Can&#x27;t Repress the Cause&quot;, a plea for greater inclusion of hip hop music in the Canadian music scene, with Dance Appeal, a supergroup of Toronto-area musicians that included Devon, Maestro Fresh Wes, Dream Warriors, B-Kool, Michie Mee, Lillian Allen, Eria Fachin, HDV, Dionne, Thando Hyman, Carla Marshall, Messenjah, Jillian Mendez, Lorraine Scott, Self Defense, Leroy Sibbles, Zama and Thyron Lee White.

Her second solo album, &quot;Luminous City&quot;, followed in 1998.

She has also worked in film production, writing and directing a documentary on Toronto&#x27;s late 1970s/early 1980s Queen Street West scene, &quot;Queen Street West, The Rebel Zone&quot;, and appearing in the documentary film &quot;The Pinco Triangle&quot;, and as a lecturer and social justice activist. Segato also appeared on the science fiction show &quot;Lexx&quot;, singing a song as the &quot;Time Prophet&quot; on the episode &quot;Brigadoom&quot;.

She performed &quot;Rise Up&quot; at the state funeral of Jack Layton on August 27, 2011, supported by the choir of the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto. In 2014, the surviving band members released a contemporary dance remix of the song in conjunction with Toronto&#x27;s hosting of the 2014 edition of WorldPride.

Her third solo album, &quot;Invincible Decency&quot;, was released in 2015. She is also preparing &quot;Get Off My Dress&quot;, a loosely autobiographical one-woman theatrical play.

Segato was one of the people named to the Order of Canada on December 29, 2022, citing &quot;her contributions to the Canadian music scene and culture as a pioneer in 2SLGBTQI+ Canadian history.&quot;

==Personal life==

Segato is out as lesbian.

<text>Julien Dubuque (January 1762 – 24 March 1810) was a Canadian of Norman origin from the area of Champlain, Quebec who arrived near what now is known as Dubuque, Iowa, which was named after him. He was one of the first European men to settle in the area. He initially received permission from the Meskwaki people to mine the lead in 1788, which was confirmed by the Spanish, who gave him a land grant in 1796.

Once he had received permission from the Meskwaki to mine lead, Dubuque remained in the area for the rest of his life. He befriended the local Meskwaki chief Peosta – for whom the nearby town of Peosta, Iowa is named. It is widely believed that Dubuque married Peosta&#x27;s daughter, named Potosa. The marriage is disputed. Those who back the marriage claim point to letters that mention a Madame Dubuque as meaning Dubuque&#x27;s wife.

After his death, the Meskwaki built a log crypt for Dubuque, which was replaced in the late 19th century by an imposing stone monument.

The name &quot;Potosa&quot; often appears in fanciful origin stories for the name of Potosi, Wisconsin, a small town founded in the 1830s as a lead-mining settlement located north of Dubuque.

==Legacy==

Dubuque is remembered as the first person of European origin to settle in what would become the state of Iowa. He is remembered as a friend of the Native Americans in the area and a champion of their cause. Dubuque was also a generous man who spent lavishly on many friends, which had the unfortunate effect of keeping him in debt during the later part of his life.

When White Americans settled what would become Iowa, a settlement in the area where he had mined was named after him. It was known by several names, including DuBuque&#x27;s Mines. Eventually, it became the first city in Iowa, and was named simply Dubuque in his honor. Dubuque&#x27;s resting place and memorial lie on a cliff facing the Mississippi river at the Julien Dubuque Monument in the Mines of Spain State Recreation Area and E. B. Lyons Nature Center.
==Facial reconstruction==

In 2012, members of the Dubuque County Historical Society and curators at the National Mississippi River Museum asked forensic artist Karen T. Taylor to create a facial reconstruction based on the skull of Dubuque. Upon his death in 1810, he was buried on a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. In the late 1800s, the original log mausoleum was replaced by the limestone tower and monument at the same site. At that time, excellent photographs were made of Dubuque&#x27;s skull prior to reburial. Though Dubuque&#x27;s actual skull now lies buried under many feet of concrete, Taylor was able to use the multiple 1887 photographs, along with historic and anthropological inputs to create a reasonable depiction of his appearance in life. The facial reconstruction images are on display at the National Mississippi River Museum &amp; Aquarium in Dubuque, Iowa.

<doc id="613271" wikidata="Q96385" url="?curid=613271" title="Fucoxanthin">
<text>Fucoxanthin is a xanthophyll, with formula C42H58O6. It is found as an accessory pigment in the chloroplasts of brown algae and most other heterokonts, giving them a brown or olive-green color. Fucoxanthin absorbs light primarily in the blue-green to yellow-green part of the visible spectrum, peaking at around 510-525 nm by various estimates and absorbing significantly in the range of 450 to 540 nm.

== Function ==
Carotenoids are pigments produced by plants and algae and play a role in light harvesting as part of the photosynthesis process. Xanthophylls are a subset of carotenoids, identified by the fact that they are oxygenated either as hydroxyl groups or as epoxide bridges. This makes them more water soluble than carotenes such as beta-carotene. Fucoxanthin is a xanthophyll that contributes more than 10% of the estimated total production of carotenoids in nature. It is an accessory pigment found in the chloroplasts of many brown macroalgae, such as &quot;Fucus spp&quot;., and the golden-brown unicellular microalgae, the diatoms. It absorbs blue and green light at bandwidth 450-540 nm, imparting a brownish-olive color to algae.
Fucoxanthin has a highly unique structure that contains both an epoxide bond and hydroxyl groups along with an allenic bond (two adjacent carbon-carbon double bonds) and a conjugated carbonyl group (carbon-oxygen double bond) in the polyene chain. All of these features provide fucoxanthin with powerful antioxidant activity.

In macroalgal plastids, fucoxanthin acts like an antenna for light harvesting and energy transfer in the photosystem light harvesting complexes. In diatoms like &quot;Phaeodactylum tricornutum&quot;, fucoxanthin is protein-bound along with chlorophyll to form a light harvesting protein complex. Fucoxanthin is the dominant carotenoid, responsible for up to 60% of the energy transfer to chlorophyll a in diatoms When bound to protein, the absorption spectrum of fucoxanthin expands from 450-540 nm to 390-580 nm, a range that is useful in aquatic environments.

== Sources ==
Fucoxanthin is present in brown seaweeds and diatoms and was first isolated from &quot;Fucus&quot;, &quot;Dictyota&quot;, and &quot;Laminaria&quot; by Willstätter and Page in 1914. Seaweeds are commonly consumed in south-east Asia and certain countries in Europe, while diatoms are single-cell planktonic microalgae characterized by a golden-brown color, due to their high content of fucoxanthin. Generally, diatoms contain up to 4 times more fucoxanthin than seaweed, making diatoms a viable source for fucoxanthin industrially. Diatoms can be grown in controlled environments (such as photobioreactors). Brown seaweeds are mostly grown in the open sea, often exposed to metals and metalloids.

== Bioavailability==

Limited studies of fucoxanthin in humans indicate low bioavailability.

<text>Windows-1251 is an 8-bit character encoding, designed to cover languages that use the Cyrillic script such as Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbian Cyrillic, Macedonian and other languages.

On the web, it is the second most-used single-byte character encoding (or third most-used character encoding overall), and most used of the single-byte encodings supporting Cyrillic. , 0.3% of all websites use Windows-1251. It&#x27;s by far mostly used for Russian, while a small minority of Russian websites use it, with 94.6% of Russian (.ru) websites using UTF-8, and the legacy 8-bit encoding is distant second. In Linux, the encoding is known as cp1251. IBM uses code page 1251 (CCSID 1251 and euro sign extended CCSID 5347) for Windows-1251.

Windows-1251 and KOI8-R (or its Ukrainian variant KOI8-U) are much more commonly used than ISO 8859-5 (which is used by less than 0.0004% of websites). In contrast to Windows-1252 and ISO 8859-1, Windows-1251 is not closely related to ISO 8859-5.

Unicode (e.g. UTF-8) is preferred to Windows-1251 or other Cyrillic encodings in modern applications, especially on the Internet, making UTF-8 the dominant encoding for web pages. (For further discussion of Unicode&#x27;s complete coverage, of 436 Cyrillic letters/code points, including for Old Cyrillic, and how single-byte character encodings, such as Windows-1251 and KOI8-R, cannot provide this, see Cyrillic script in Unicode.)

==Character set==
The following table shows Windows-1251. Each character is shown with its Unicode equivalent and its Alt code.


==Kazakh variants==
An altered version of Windows-1251 was standardised in Kazakhstan as Kazakh standard STRK1048, and is known by the label . It differs in the rows shown below:


Code Page 1174 is another variant created for the Kazakh language, which matches Windows-1251 for the Russian subset of the Cyrillic letters. It differs from KZ-1048 by moving the Cyrillic letter Shha from 8E/9E to 8A/9A.


==Amiga variant==

Russian Amiga OS systems used a version of code page 1251 which matches Windows-1251 for the Russian subset of the Cyrillic letters, but otherwise mostly follows ISO-8859-1. This version is known as Amiga-1251, under which name it is registered with the IANA.

<doc id="613307" wikidata="Q7815084" url="?curid=613307" title="Tom Brown's School Days">
<text>Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days (sometimes written &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;, also published under the titles &quot;Tom Brown at Rugby&quot;, &quot;School Days at Rugby&quot;, and &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days at Rugby&quot;) is a novel by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The story is set in the 1830s at Rugby School, an English public school. Hughes attended Rugby School from 1834 to 1842.

The novel was originally published as being &quot;by an Old Boy of Rugby&quot;, and much of it is based on the author&#x27;s experiences. Tom Brown is largely based on the author&#x27;s brother George Hughes. George Arthur, another of the book&#x27;s main characters, is generally believed to be based on Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (Dean Stanley). The fictional Tom&#x27;s life also resembles the author&#x27;s, in that the culminating event of his school career was a cricket match. The novel also features Dr Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), who was the actual headmaster of Rugby School from 1828 to 1841.

&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; has been the source for several film and television adaptations. It also influenced the genre of British school novels, which began in the nineteenth century, and led to fictional depictions of schools such as Mr Chips&#x27;s Brookfield, and St Trinian&#x27;s. A sequel, &quot;Tom Brown at Oxford&quot;, was published in 1861.

==Synopsis==
Tom Brown is energetic, stubborn, kind-hearted and athletic, rather than intellectual. He follows his feelings and the unwritten rules of the boys.

The early chapters of the novel deal with his childhood at his home in the Vale of White Horse. Much of the scene setting in the first chapter is deeply revealing of Victorian Britain&#x27;s attitudes towards society and class, and contains a comparison of so-called Saxon and Norman influences on the country. This part of the book, when young Tom wanders the valleys freely on his pony, serves as a contrast with the hellish experiences in his first years at school.
His first school year is at a local school. His second year starts at a private school, but due to an epidemic of fever in the area, all the school&#x27;s boys are sent home, and Tom is transferred mid-term to Rugby School.

On his arrival, the eleven-year-old Tom Brown is looked after by a more experienced classmate, Harry &quot;Scud&quot; East. Tom&#x27;s nemesis at Rugby is the bully Flashman. The intensity of the bullying increases and after refusing to hand over a sweepstake ticket for the favourite in a horse race, Tom is deliberately burned in front of a fire. Tom and East defeat Flashman with the help of Diggs, a kind, comical, older boy. In their triumph they become unruly.

In the second half of the book, Dr Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), the historical headmaster of the school at the time, asks Tom to look after George Arthur, a frail, pious, academically brilliant, gauche, and sensitive new boy. A fight that Tom gets into to protect Arthur, and Arthur&#x27;s nearly dying of fever, are described in detail. Tom and Arthur help each other and the friends develop into young gentlemen who say their nightly prayers, do not cheat on homework, and play in a cricket match. An epilogue shows Tom&#x27;s return to Rugby and its chapel when he hears of Arnold&#x27;s death.

==Main characters==
* Tom Brown, a mid-term newcomer to Rugby School who learns many life lessons there
* Harry &quot;Scud&quot; East, an older boy who looks after Tom
* Dr Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), the headmaster of Rugby School from 1828 to 1841
*Flashman, a bully who targets and torments Tom
* Diggs, a jocular older student who helps Tom
* George Arthur, a frail newcomer whom Tom guides as East had guided him

==Major themes==
A main element of the novel is Rugby School, with its traditions, and the reforms that were instituted there by Dr Arnold (1795–1842), the headmaster of the school from 1828 to 1841. He is portrayed as the perfect teacher and counsellor, and as managing everything behind the scenes. In particular, he is the one who &quot;chums&quot; Arthur with Tom.

The central theme of the novel is the development of boys. The symmetrical way in which Tom and Arthur supply each other&#x27;s deficiencies shows that Hughes believed in the importance of physical development, boldness, fighting spirit, and sociability (Tom&#x27;s contribution) as well as Christian morality and idealism (Arthur&#x27;s).

The novel is essentially didactic and was not primarily written as an entertainment. As Hughes said:

==Impact==
Although there were as many as 90 stories set in British boarding schools published between Sarah Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The Governess, or The Little Female Academy&quot; in 1749 and 1857, &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; was responsible for bringing the school story genre to much wider attention. &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;″ influence on the genre of British school novels includes the fictional schools of Billy Bunter, Mr. Chips, St. Trinian&#x27;s, and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.

The book contains an account of a game of rugby football, the variant of football played at Rugby School (with many differences from the modern forms). The book&#x27;s popularity helped to spread the popularity of this sport beyond the school.

In Japan, &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; was probably the most popular textbook of English-language origin for high-school students during the Meiji period (1868–1912). In 1899, an abridged version of the book (omitting chapter 9 of part 1, and chapters 5 and 7 of part 2) was published in Japanese translation. A subsequent, two-part, Japanese translation by Tsurumatsu Okamoto and Tomomasa Murayama appeared in 1903 and 1904, which, in addition to the previous omissions, also omitted the scene at the cricket match, due to the translators&#x27; stated ignorance of the game of cricket. In the preface to this version, the translators praised the British education system, citing the example of the friendship between Tom and Dr Arnold as an example of how to raise a great nation. Another partial translation, consisting only of part 1 of the book, was released in 1912 by schoolteacher Nagao Tachibana. A fourth translation, also abridged, by Sada Tokinoya arrived in 1925. Finally, a complete translation was released in 1947 that eventually ran to ten separate editions.

==Dramatic adaptations==
&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; has had several screen adaptations, including:

*&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (1916 film) (silent)
*&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; (1940 film)
*&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (1951 film)
*&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (1971 TV miniseries)
*&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (2005 TV film)

In the 1940 U.S. film, the role of Dr Thomas Arnold was portrayed by Cedric Hardwicke, Tom Brown was played by Jimmy Lydon, and Freddie Bartholomew played East. The role of Dr Thomas Arnold as a reform-minded educator was given greater prominence than in the novel. The entertainment journal &quot;Variety&quot; praised this, saying, &quot;It probably results in a better picture, since Cedric Hardwicke, who plays the wise and kindly teacher, is much better qualified to carry a story than is any Hollywood prodigy. Hardwicke’s performance is one of the best he has ever given on the screen&quot;. In the 1951 British film, Robert Newton portrayed Thomas Arnold, and John Howard Davies portrayed Tom Brown.

The 1971 five-part television miniseries was by the BBC, and starred Anthony Murphy as Tom Brown and Iain Cuthbertson as Dr. Arnold. It was later shown on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; in the U.S., and both the programme and Murphy&#x27;s lead performance won Emmy Awards.

The two-hour 2005 TV film was by ITV. It starred Alex Pettyfer as Tom and Stephen Fry as Dr Arnold.

A musical version with music by Chris Andrews and book and lyrics by Jack and Joan Maitland was presented at the Cambridge Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in 1971. The production starred Keith Chegwin, Roy Dotrice, Simon Le Bon, and Tony Sympson.

A full-cast audio drama dramatised by Joe Dunlop and directed by Chris Wallis was first broadcast in 2001 on BBC Radio 4.

==References in other works==
* Terry Pratchett confirmed that the section of his 1989 novel &quot;Pyramids&quot; set at the Assassin&#x27;s Guild School is a parody of &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;.

===Flashman===

The character of Flashman was adapted by the British writer George MacDonald Fraser as the adult narrator and hero (or anti-hero) of his popular series of &quot;Flashman&quot; historical novels called &quot;The Flashman Papers&quot;. In one of them, &quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot;, the character whom Fraser named Harry Flashman reads &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, which refers to his youth, and its popularity causes him a few social troubles. Fraser&#x27;s Flashman novels also include several other characters from &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, for example George Speedicut and Tom Brown himself in the book &quot;Flashman&#x27;s Lady&quot;. Flashman also encounters the character of &quot;Scud&quot; East twice, first in &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot;, when both he and East are prisoners of war during the Crimean War, and again in &quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot;, at the Siege of Cawnpore during the Indian Mutiny of 1857.

<text>Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), also known as congenital analgesia, is one or more extraordinarily rare conditions in which a person cannot feel (and has never felt) physical pain. The conditions described here are separate from the HSAN group of disorders, which have more specific signs and cause. Because feeling physical pain is vital for survival, CIP is an extremely dangerous condition. It is common for people with the condition to die in childhood due to injuries or illnesses going unnoticed. Burn injuries are among the more common injuries.

== Signs and symptoms ==

For people with this disorder, cognition and sensation are otherwise normal; for instance, patients can still feel discriminative touch (though not always temperature), and there are generally no detectable physical abnormalities.

Because children and adults with the disorder cannot feel pain, they may not respond to problems, thus being at a higher risk of more severe diseases. Children with this condition often sustain oral cavity damage both in and around the oral cavity (such as having bitten off the tip of their tongue) or fractures to bones. Unnoticed infections and corneal damage due to foreign objects in the eye are also seen.

There are generally two types of non-response exhibited:
* Insensitivity to pain means that the painful stimulus is not even perceived: a patient cannot describe the intensity or type of pain.
* Indifference to pain means that the patient can perceive the stimulus, but lacks an appropriate response: they do not flinch or withdraw when exposed to pain.

== Causes ==
Extremely rare genetic disorders are some of the causes for the condition. It may be that the condition is caused by increased production of endorphins in the brain. In this case, naloxone may be a treatment, but it does not always work.
In all cases, this disorder can be in the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN9A (Nav1.7). Patients with such mutations are congenitally insensitive to pain and lack other neuropathies. There are three mutations in SCN9A: W897X, located in the P-loop of domain 2; I767X, located in the S2 segment of domain 2; and S459X, located in the linker region between domains 1 and 2. This results in a truncated non-functional protein. Nav1.7 channels are expressed at high levels in nociceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. As these channels are likely involved in the formation and propagation of action potentials in such neurons, it is expected that a loss of function mutation in SCN9A leads to abolished nociceptive pain propagation.

PRDM12 gene is normally switched on during the development of pain-sensing nerve cells. People with homozygous mutations of the PRDM12 gene experience congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP).

A heterozygous microdeletion in the &quot;FAAH-OUT&quot; pseudogene of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) chromosomal region that is expressed in the brain and dorsal root ganglia together with a common hypomorphic single nucleotide polymorphism in the &quot;FAAH&quot; gene was identified as the presumptive cause of congenital analgesia in a woman named Jo Cameron. She experienced lifelong insensitivity to pain and was oblivious to cuts and burns, did not experience pain during childbirth, did not experience pain from degeneration of a hip that required hip replacement surgery, and did not require analgesics for postoperative pain. Furthermore, she exhibited expedited wound healing and reduced scarring, could not sense heat from chili peppers, did not experience depression, fear, and anxiety and lacked a normal fear response to erratic and aggressive behaviour. However, Cameron also experienced slight memory impairment (was prone to losing the trail of thought while speaking, and experienced some forgetfulness), and could not experience thrill (&quot;adrenaline rush&quot;).

Another gene implicated in human pain insensitivity is ZFHX2, which encodes zinc finger homeobox 2. A 2018 study analysed six members of a family with inherited pain insensitivity and identified a &quot;novel point mutation in ZFHX2, encoding a putative transcription factor expressed in small diameter sensory neurons&quot;, as the cause. As a therapeutic application, the study further discuses how &quot;the ZFHX2 variant and downstream regulated genes associated with a human pain-insensitive phenotype are ... potential novel targets for the development of new analgesic drugs&quot;.

Developmental disabilities such as autism can include varying degrees of pain insensitivity as a sign. However, since these disorders are characterized by dysfunction of the sensory system in general, autism is not in itself an indicator of congenital insensitivity to pain.

==Treatment==
The opioid antagonist naloxone allowed a woman with congenital insensitivity to pain to experience it for the first time. Similar effects were observed in Nav1.7 null mice treated with naloxone. As such, opioid antagonists like naloxone and naltrexone may be effective in treating the condition.

== Epidemiology ==
It has been estimated to have a worldwide incidence of approximately 1 in every 25,000 births.

Congenital insensitivity to pain is found at an abnormally high frequency in Vittangi, a village in Kiruna Municipality in northern Sweden, where nearly 40 cases have been reported.

<doc id="613334" wikidata="Q8382" url="?curid=613334" title="Cigarillo">
<text>A cigarillo (; in turn (diminutive suffix); in parts of Latin America, in Spain) is a short, narrow cigar. Unlike cigarettes, cigarillos are wrapped in tobacco leaves or brown, tobacco-based paper. Cigarillos are smaller than regular cigars but usually larger than cigarettes. Cigarillos are usually made without filters, and are meant to be smoked like a cigar and not inhaled (except those made in this form only for specific tax issues).

Generally, a cigarillo contains about three grams of tobacco; the length varies from and the diameter is about 6–9 mm, usually 8 mm. Comparatively, a cigarette contains less than one gram of tobacco, and is about in length and 8 mm in diameter. Most cigarillos are machine-made, which is cheaper than hand-rolling. It is unusual to store them in humidors, partly because they are smoked in large quantities and so have a short shelf-life.

Cheap cigarillos are typically marketed as a brand rather than with the term &quot;cigarillo&quot;. In the United Kingdom, common consumer brands include Henri Wintermans Signature (formerly Café Creme) and Hamlets. In the rest of Europe, they include Dannemann Moods, Candlelight, Agio Panters and Mehari&#x27;s, Clubmaster and Handelsgold are popular. In the United States, they include Swisher Sweets, Black &amp; Mild, Backwoods, Dutch Masters, Garcia Y Vega, Game, Optimo, Good Times, and Phillies. Some famous cigar brands, such as Cohiba or Davidoff, also make cigarillos: Cohiba Mini and Davidoff Club Cigarillos.

In Spanish-speaking countries, as well as in the Philippines, &quot;cigarrillo&quot; means a cigarette. Anglo-Americans were first introduced to &#x27;cigarrillos&#x27; on a massive scale during their conquest of New Mexico and California in the American-Mexican War 1846–1848. It was observed that, &quot;Both sexes smoke &quot;cigarrillos&quot; almost incessantly&quot;.

==Taxation==

In the United States, cigarillos (and cigars) were taxed at a lower rate than cigarettes. In February 2009 an increase from 5 cents to 40 cents per pack as part of the SCHIP expansion bill set a tax rate similar to that for cigarettes.

==Health concerns==

Like other tobacco products, cigarillos are a health risk to those who smoke them. In Brazil, Uruguay, Canada, Australia, India, and throughout Europe they are subject to the same laws which require manufacturers to place a health warning on a portion of each package. Like cigars, cigarillos are not meant to be inhaled. As a result of this, it is often assumed that cigarillos are a healthier alternative to cigarettes, but health authorities around the world still warn smokers of the risk they pose due to smoke being in the mouth.
