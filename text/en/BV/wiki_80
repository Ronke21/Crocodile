<text>Viognier () is a white wine grape variety. It is the only permitted grape for the French wine Condrieu in the Rhône Valley.

Outside of the Rhône, Viognier can be found in regions of North and South America as well as Australia, New Zealand, the Cape Winelands in South Africa, south Moravia region in Czechia, Israel and in Austria at Weingut Roland Minkowitsch. In some wine regions, the variety is co-fermented with the red wine grape Syrah where it can contribute to the color and aroma of the wine.

Like Chardonnay, Viognier has the potential to produce full-bodied wines with a lush, soft character. In contrast to Chardonnay, the Viognier varietal has more natural aromatics that include notes of peach, pears, violets and minerality. However, these aromatic notes can be easily destroyed by too much exposure to oxygen, which makes barrel fermentation a winemaking technique that requires a high level of skill on the part of any winemaker working with this variety.

The potential quality of Viognier is also highly dependent on viticultural practices and climate, with the grape requiring a long, warm growing season in order to fully ripen but not a climate that is so hot that the grape develops high levels of sugars and potential alcohol before its aromatic notes can develop. The grape is naturally a low-yielding variety, which can make it a less economically viable planting for some vineyards.

==History==
The origin of the Viognier grape is unknown; it is presumed to be an ancient grape, possibly originating in Dalmatia (present day Croatia) and then brought to the Rhône by the Romans. One legend states that the Roman emperor Probus brought the vine to the region in 281 AD; another has the grape packaged with Syrah on a cargo ship navigating the Rhône river, en route to Beaujolais when it was captured, near the site of present-day Condrieu, by a local group of outlaws known as &quot;culs de piaux&quot;.

The origin of the name Viognier is also obscure. The most common namesake is the French city of Vienne, which was a major Roman outpost. Another legend has it drawing its name from the Roman pronunciation of the &quot;via Gehennae&quot;, meaning the &quot;Road of the Valley of Hell&quot;. Probably this is an allusion to the difficulty of growing the grape.
Viognier was once fairly common. In 1965, the grape was almost extinct, and a source reported only eight acres in Northern Rhône producing just 1,900 liters of wine at that time. The popularity and price of the wine have risen, and the number of plantings has increased. Rhône now has over planted.

In 2004, DNA profiling conducted at University of California, Davis showed the grape to be closely related to the Piedmont grape Freisa, and to be a genetic cousin of Nebbiolo.

==Viticulture==

Viognier can be a difficult grape to grow because it is prone to powdery mildew. It has low and unpredictable yields and should be picked only when fully ripe. When picked too early, the grape fails to develop the full extent of its aromas and tastes. When picked too late, the grape produces wine that is oily and lacks perfume. Winemakers in the Condrieu often pick the grapes with a level of sugar that will produce wine with alcohol in the 13% range. When fully ripe the grapes have a deep yellow color and produce wine with a strong perfume and high in alcohol . The grape prefers warmer environments and a long growing season, but can grow in cooler areas as well.

In France, the Mistral has a distinct effect on the Viognier vineyards in the Northern Rhône. The wind tempers the Mediterranean climate of the region, and cools the vines down after the severe heat of summer.

Wine expert Remington Norman has identified two distinct strains of Viognier — an &quot;Old World&quot; strain, most common in Condrieu, and a &quot;New World&quot; strain, which is found in the Languedoc and other areas. Although made from the same grape, the two strains produce distinctly different wines.

The age of the vine also has an effect on the quality of the wine produced. Viognier vines start to hit their peak after 15–20 years. In the Rhône, there are vines at least 70 years old.

==Regional production==

Viognier has been planted much more extensively around the world since the early 1990s. Both California and Australia now have significant amounts of land devoted to the Viognier grape. There are also notable planting increases in areas of moderate climate such as Virginia&#x27;s Monticello AVA region.

The decline of Viognier in France from its historic peak has much to do with the disastrous predations of the phylloxera insects from North America in Europe in the mid- and late-19th century, followed by the abandonment of the vineyards due to the chaos of World War I. By 1965, only about of Viognier vines remained in France, and the variety was nearly extinct. Even as late as the mid-1980s, Viognier in France was endangered. In parallel to the growth of Viognier in the rest of the world, plantings in France have grown dramatically since then. The grape has been enjoying some success South Africa, New Zealand, Greece and Japan.

===France===

In France, Viognier is the single permitted grape variety in the Rhône appellations of Condrieu and Château Grillet, which are located on the west bank of the Rhône, about 40 km south of Lyon. In the rest of the Rhône wine region whites, the grape is often blended with Roussanne, Marsanne, Grenache blanc, and Rolle. In the Northern Rhône, the grape is sometimes blended with Chardonnay. In the Côte-Rôtie AOC, red wine blends can include up to 20% of Viognier though most growers add no more than 5%. Since Viognier ripens earlier than Syrah, the grape is normally harvested separately and added to the Syrah during fermentation. One of the benefits of adding Viognier is that the process of co-pigmentation stabilizes the coloring of the red wine.

Vignerons in the rest of France often look to plant Viognier in areas rich in granite soil that have a heat retaining quality that the grape seems to thrive in. Beaujolais winemaker Georges Duboeuf helped expand the reach of the grape with plantings in the Ardèche region. The majority of French Viogniers are now grown in the Languedoc and sold as &quot;Vin de Pays&quot;.

===North America===

Since the late 1980s, plantings of Viognier in the United States and Canada have increased dramatically. California&#x27;s Central Coast is the leading producer with over of the grape planted. Californian Viogniers are noticeably higher in alcohol compared to other wines made from the grape. The Rhone Rangers of the mid-1980s helped spark the increased interest in Viognier in California. It has received international attention growing in Virginia, and in 2011 was named Virginia&#x27;s signature white grape.

The grape can also be found in Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Washington, Oregon, Michigan, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Missouri and Arizona, Valle de Guadalupe, Baja California as well as British Columbia and the Niagara and Lake Erie North Shore regions of Ontario.

===South America===
Both Argentina and Chile have significant plantings of the grape with some producers in Brazil and Uruguay also experimenting with the varietal.

===Australia===
In Australia, Yalumba is the country&#x27;s largest producer of the grape making both a white wine varietal and making extensive use of the grape in its Shiraz blends. Yalumba grows the grape in the loam and clay soil of the Eden Valley. Other areas with Viognier plantings include Clare Valley, Rutherglen, Murray River, McLaren Vale, Geelong, Nagambie Lakes, Canberra, Mornington Peninsula, Barossa Valley, Adelaide Hills, Geographe, South Burnett, Yarra Valley (Pimpernel Vineyards) and Pyrenees

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, small amounts of Viognier are grown on Waiheke Island and Wairarapa. In the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region, the grape is used as a single varietal as well as being blended with Syrah to produce a traditional Rhône style red wine.

===Israel===

Many Israeli wineries, particularly in the north, such as Yarden, Tishbi and Dalton have cultivated the grape and produced Viognier wines and blends with it with much success.

==Wine==

Viognier wines are well known for their floral aromas, and terpenes, which are also found in Muscat and Riesling wines. There are also many other powerful flower and fruit aromas which can be perceived in these wines depending on where they were grown, the weather conditions and how old the vines were. Although some of these wines, especially those from old vines and the late-harvest wines, are suitable for aging, most are intended to be consumed young. Viogniers more than three years old tend to lose many of the floral aromas that make this wine unique. Aging these wines will often yield a very crisp drinking wine which is almost completely flat in the nose. The color and the aroma of the wine suggest a sweet wine but Viognier wines are predominantly dry, although sweet late-harvest dessert wines have been made.

It is a grape with low acidity; it is sometimes used to soften wines made predominantly with the red Syrah grape. In addition to its softening qualities the grape also adds a colour-stabilizing agent and enhanced perfume to the red wine. In the Rhone region, the grapes normally are not affected by the fungus &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; though botrytized Viognier is not unheard of.

In winemaking, the grapes are often harvested early in the morning to produce the clearest juice possible. Some winemakers will allow contact with the skins. The skin of Viognier is high in phenols - compounds that can leave an astringent component to the wine if juice is left in contact with the skins for too long. Sometimes the wine is put through malolactic fermentation to give the wine more weight and to decrease acidity. In New World Viognier, the lees may be stirred in a process called &quot;batonnage&quot; in order to increase the smooth texture of the wine. The wine is then left on the lees till bottling in a manner similar to sparkling wine production.

In the creation of the dessert style Viognier, the grapes are often picked in late October or early November in the Northern Hemisphere. A common harvest technique used in the Condrieu is known as &quot;à l&#x27;assiette&quot; where a plate is held underneath a Viognier vine that is then shaken to allow the overripe grapes to drop onto the plate. Fermentation is then stopped early through the use of sulphur dioxide to allow the wine to retain a high level of residual sugar. The wine is then chilled and put through sterile filtration to ensure that the wine is stable and will not start fermenting again in the bottle.

Depending on the winemaking style the grape can often hit its peak at one-two years of age, though some can stay at high levels of quality up to ten years. Typically Condrieu wines are the Viogniers most often meant to be drunk young while Californian and Australian wines can handle age a little bit better.

==Food pairing==
The highly aromatic and fruit forward nature of the grape allows Viognier to pair well with spicy foods such as Thai cuisine.

<text>Feminizing gender-affirming surgery for transgender women or transfeminine non-binary people describes a variety of surgical procedures that alter the body to provide physical traits more comfortable and affirming to an individual&#x27;s gender identity and overall functioning.

Often used to refer to vaginoplasty, sex reassignment surgery can also more broadly refer to other gender-affirming procedures an individual may have, such as permanent reduction or removal of body or facial hair through laser hair removal or electrolysis, facial feminization surgery, tracheal shave, vulvoplasty, orchiectomy, voice surgery, or breast augmentation. Sex reassignment surgery is usually preceded by beginning feminizing hormone therapy. Some surgeries can reduce the need for hormone therapy.

Gender-affirming surgeries for transgender women have taken place since the 16th century, though they became more notable in the 20th century. Most patients report greater quality of life and sexual health outcomes postoperatively.

==Genital surgery==
There are a variety of genital surgeries available to trans women and transfeminine non-binary people. Genital surgery can be an effective way for an individual to ease or eliminate feelings of disconnection or discomfort with their natal genitals; for others, including those who do not feel strongly about their natal genitals, it can create feelings of connection or congruence with their genitals post-surgery. Following the removal of the testicles, the human body produces very little testosterone. This can reduce the need to take supplemental estrogen medication and eliminates the need to take antiandrogen medication.

=== Vaginoplasty ===
Vaginoplasty is the process of constructing a neovagina and neovulva from existing genital or abdominal tissue. There are multiple techniques for performing vaginoplasty. Sexual sensation is typically retained following surgery, and the self-reported rate of personal satisfaction with surgical results across different vaginoplasty techniques is very high.

==== Penile inversion ====
Penile inversion is a very common vaginoplasty technique. The testicles and scrotum are removed and the glans of the penis is made into a clitoris. A canal is surgically created between the bladder and the rectum. The foreskin of the penis is inverted to form the interior walls of the neovagina. If the patient had been circumcised before surgery, skin from the scrotum may also be used to construct the walls of the neovagina after cauterising the hair follicles. The urethra is shortened, and the mons pubis, labia majora and minora, and urethral opening are created using scrotal and urethral tissue.

Because this technique inverts the skin of the penis to form the walls of the neovagina, post-operative depth is limited by the length of the penis prior to surgery. Following surgery, a patient will need to dilate the neovagina with a vaginal dilator 1-2 times daily to prevent loss of vaginal depth. The need to dilate becomes less frequent with time, but is recommended at least once a week after the neovagina has healed completely. Having penetrative sex can affect the amount of dilation needed, but additional lubricant is required during penetrative sex as the neovagina created through penile inversion vaginoplasty is not self-lubricating.

In a small number of cases (roughly 0-5%), rectal injury can occur as an intraoperative complication. Other common complications include meatal stenosis, urinary retention, or haemorrhage.

==== Peritoneal vaginoplasty ====
Transgender peritoneal vaginoplasty, peritoneal pull-down or pull-through (PPT), is based on neovaginal techniques documented in the 1970s and 80s for cisgender women born without a vaginal canal due to agenesis/atresia, which were referred to as the &quot;Davydov&quot; procedure or &quot;Rothman&#x27;s&quot; method. A 2022 review states, &quot;In the last 5 years, peritoneal flap vaginoplasty has emerged as a promising technique&quot;.

This form of vaginoplasty utilizes tissue of the peritoneum to form the canal lining of the neovagina.

For trans women who had their puberty blocked, insufficient penile and scrotal skin may be available for traditional penile inversion. In such cases, peritoneal vaginoplasty remedies the issue of insufficient tissue. Peritoneal vaginoplasty can be used as a surgical revision to increase or restore vaginal depth in persons who have had a previous vaginoplasty.

This technique has been reported to provide some degree of vaginal lubrication. This lubrication, however, is not responsive to sexual arousal, and functions more as regular vaginal discharge while not identical to natal vaginal fluids.

==== Bowel vaginoplasty ====
Bowel vaginoplasty is another common vaginoplasty technique. It is also used for vaginoplasty in cisgender women. As with penile inversion vaginoplasty, the testicles and scrotum are removed, the glans made into a clitoris, and the neovulva constructed from scrotal, penile and urethral tissue. However, in bowel vaginoplasty a segment of rectosigmoid colon is grafted into a surgically created canal to form the neovagina.

As bowel vaginoplasty uses colon to construct the neovagina, post-operative depth is not dependent on the length of the penis prior to surgery. This makes it appropriate for individuals who have already undergone penectomy, orchiectomy, or who had a penis smaller than the desired depth of the neovagina prior to surgery. Unlike penile inversion vaginoplasty, the neovagina created through bowel vaginoplasty is self-lubricating and does not require further dilation once fully healed.

==== Jejunum vaginoplasty ====

Jejunum vaginoplasty uses a segment of the jejunum to create the neovagina. The approach was created to solve some of the shortcomings of skin graft, peritoneal, and colonic vaginoplasties. Jejunum vaginoplasty has been historically successful when performed in natal females.

=== Vulvoplasty ===
Vulvoplasty is the process of constructing a neovulva from existing genital tissue. The testicles, scrotum, and penis are removed, and the glans made into a clitoris. The urethra is shortened, and the mons pubis, labia majora and minora, and urethral opening are created using scrotal and urethral tissue. Unlike vaginoplasty, a neovagina is not created.

Because vulvoplasty does not create a neovagina, it is appropriate for individuals who do not wish to have vaginal sex following surgery or who are not interested in the increased aftercare routine of vaginoplasty.

=== Orchiectomy ===
Orchiectomy is the process of removing the testicles from the body. It can be performed with or without removing the scrotum. An incision is made in the middle of the scrotum and the spermatic cord stitched to prevent excessive bleeding. The testicles are then removed through the incision.

An individual who undergoes an orchiectomy will produce very little testosterone due to the removal of their testicles. This natural reduction in testosterone eliminates the need to take antiandrogen medication, which in turn can reduce the need to take supplemental estrogen medication.

==Other related procedures==
===Facial feminization surgery===
Occasionally these basic procedures are complemented further with feminizing cosmetic surgeries or procedures that modify bone or cartilage structures, typically in the jaw, brow, forehead, nose and cheek areas. These are known as facial feminization surgery or FFS.

===Breast augmentation===
Breast augmentation is the enlargement of the breasts. Some trans women choose to undergo this procedure if hormone therapy does not yield satisfactory results. Usually, typical growth for trans women is one to two cup sizes below closely related females such as the mother or sisters. Oestrogen is responsible for fat distribution to the breasts, hips and buttocks, while progesterone is responsible for developing the actual milk glands. Progesterone also rounds out the breast to an adult Tanner stage-5 shape and matures and darkens the areola.

===Voice feminization surgery===

Some MTF individuals may elect to have voice surgery, which alters an individual&#x27;s vocal range or pitch. However, this procedure carries a risk of impairing a trans woman&#x27;s voice forever. Since estrogen alone does not alter a person&#x27;s vocal range or pitch, some people take the risk that comes along with voice feminization surgery. Other options, like voice feminization lessons, are available to people wishing to speak with less masculine mannerisms.

===Tracheal shave===
A tracheal shave procedure is also sometimes used to reduce the cartilage in the area of the throat and minimize the appearance of the Adam&#x27;s apple in order to assimilate to female physical features.

===Buttock augmentation===
Some MTF individuals will choose to undergo buttock augmentation because anatomically, male hips and buttocks are generally smaller than those presented on a female. If, however, efficient hormone therapy is conducted before the patient is past puberty, the pelvis will broaden slightly, and even if the patient is past their teen years, a layer of subcutaneous fat will be distributed over the body, rounding contours. Trans women usually end up with a waist to hip ratio of around 0.8, and if estrogen is administered at a young enough age &quot;before the bone plates close&quot;, some trans women may achieve a waist to hip ratio of 0.7 or lower. The pubescent pelvis will broaden under estrogen therapy even if the skeleton is anatomically masculine.

== History ==
Lili Elbe was the first well-known recipient of male-to-female sex reassignment surgery, in Germany in 1930, the first being Dora Richter. She was the subject of four surgeries: one for orchiectomy, one to transplant an ovary, one for penectomy, and one for vaginoplasty and a uterus transplant. However, she died three months after her last operation.

Christine Jorgensen was likely the most famous recipient of sex reassignment surgery, having her surgery done in Denmark in late 1952 and being outed right afterwards. She was a strong advocate for the rights of transgender people.

French actress and singer Coccinelle travelled to Casablanca in 1958 to undergo a vaginoplasty by Georges Burou. She said later, &quot;Dr Burou rectified the mistake nature had made and I became a real woman, on the inside as well as the outside. After the operation, the doctor just said, &#x27;Bonjour, Mademoiselle&#x27;, and I knew it had been a success.&quot;

Another famous person to undergo male-to-female sex reassignment surgery was Renée Richards. She transitioned and had surgery in the mid-1970s, and successfully advocated to have transgender people recognized in U.S. sports.

The first physician to perform sex reassignment surgery in the United States was Los Angeles-based urologist Elmer Belt, who quietly performed operations from the early 1950s until 1968. In 1966, Johns Hopkins University opened the first sex reassignment surgery clinic in America. The Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic was made up of two plastic surgeons, two psychiatrists, two psychologists, a gynecologist, a urologist, and a pediatrician.

In 1997, Sergeant Sylvia Durand became the first serving member of the Canadian Forces to transition from male to female, and became the first member of any military worldwide to transition openly while serving under the Flag. On Canada Day of 1998, the military changed her legal name to Sylvia and changed her sex designation on all of her personal file documents. In 1999, the military paid for her sex reassignment surgery. Durand continued to serve and was promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer. When she retired in 2012, after more than 31 years of service, she was the assistant to the Canadian Forces Chief Communications Operator.

In 2017, for the first time, the United States Defense Health Agency approved payment for sex reassignment surgery for an active-duty U.S. military service member. The patient, an infantry soldier who identifies as a woman, had already begun a course of treatment for gender reassignment. The procedure, which the treating doctor deemed medically necessary, was performed on November 14 at a private hospital, since U.S. military hospitals lack the requisite surgical expertise.

<doc id="627984" wikidata="Q1361158" url="?curid=627984" title="George Alcock">
<text>George Eric Deacon Alcock, MBE (28 August 1912, in Peterborough, Northamptonshire – 15 December 2000) was an English amateur astronomer. He was one of the most successful visual discoverers of novae and comets.

George’s interest in astronomy was sparked by his first encounter with the solar eclipse of 8 April 1921. His interest evolved into the observation of meteors and meteor showers, resulting to him joining the British Astronomical Association on 27 March 1935. In 1953, he started his search for comets and in 1955 for novae. His technique involved memorization of the patterns of thousands of stars, so that he would visually recognize any intruder.

In 1959, he discovered comet C/1959 Q1 — the first comet discovered in Britain since 1894. After five days, he discovered another, named C/1959 Q2. He discovered two more comets in 1963 (C/1963 F1) and 1965 (C/1965 S2). His first Nova was Delphini 1967 (HR Delphini), which turned out to have an unusual light-curve. He discovered two more novae, LV Vul (in 1968) and V368 Sct (in 1970). He found his fifth and final comet in 1983: C/1983 H1 (IRAS-Araki-Alcock). In 1991 he found the nova V838 Her.

==Honours and awards==

Alcock became a Fellow of 3 British societies in 1947—the Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal Geographical Society, and the Royal Meteorological Society. He won the Jackson-Gwilt Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1963. On 7 February 1979, Queen Elizabeth II conferred on him an MBE. In 1981, he received the International Amateur Achievement Award from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

An asteroid, 3174 Alcock is named after him.

He also maintained an active interest in meteorology (the study of weather, unrelated to his interest in meteors).

In 1996, Genesis Publications published a limited edition signed biography, authored by Kay Williams, entitled &quot;Under An English Heaven - The Life of George Alcock&quot;.

After his death, a plaque was placed in Peterborough Cathedral in his memory.

==Personal life==
In 1936, Alcock met Mary Green through their shared interest in astronomy. They were married on 7 June 1941, and moved to the village of Farcet from 1955, in a house they called Antares, where Alcock discovered five comets and five nova. Mary died on 25 October 1991.

<doc id="627986" wikidata="Q7129993" url="?curid=627986" title="2004 Panamanian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Panama on Sunday, 2 May 2004, electing both a new President of the Republic and a new Legislative Assembly.

==Results==
===President===
For the second consecutive election, Martín Torrijos, son of former military ruler Omar Torrijos, was named the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD); in 1999, he had lost to Mireya Moscoso. Torrijos ran on a platform of strengthening democracy and negotiating a free trade agreement with the US, and was supported by popular musician and politician Rubén Blades; Torrijos later made Blades the nation&#x27;s tourism minister. Torrijos&#x27; primary rival was Guillermo Endara, who had served as president from 1990 to 1994. Endara ran as the candidate of the Solidarity Party, on a platform of reducing crime and government corruption. Endara and the other candidates also ran a series of negative ads highlighting the PRD&#x27;s connections with former military ruler Manuel Noriega. Endara finished second in the race, receiving 31% of the vote to Torrijos&#x27; 47%.

Torrijos assumed office on 1 September 2004. Voters also elected his two vice-presidents, who run on party tickets in conjunction with the presidential candidates.

===Legislative Assembly===
In addition to its president and vice presidents, Panama elected a new Legislative Assembly (78 members), 20 deputies to represent the country at the Central American Parliament, and a string of mayors and other municipal officers.

The Panama City mayor race was won also by the PRD. Mayor Juan Carlos Navarro was re-elected.

<text>The Semperoper () is the opera house of the Sächsische Staatsoper Dresden (Saxon State Opera) and the concert hall of the Staatskapelle Dresden (Saxon State Orchestra). It is also home to the Semperoper Ballett. The building is located on the Theaterplatz near the Elbe River in the historic centre of Dresden, Germany.

The opera house was originally built by the architect Gottfried Semper in 1841. After a devastating fire in 1869, the opera house was rebuilt, partly again by Semper, and completed in 1878. The opera house has a long history of premieres, including major works by Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss.

==History==

The first opera house at the location of today&#x27;s Semperoper was built by the architect Gottfried Semper. It opened on 13 April 1841 with an opera by Carl Maria von Weber. The building style itself is debated among many, as it has features that appear in three styles: early Renaissance and Baroque, with Corinthian style pillars typical of Greek classical revival. Perhaps the most suitable label for this style would be eclecticism, where influences from many styles are used, a practice most common during this period. The opera building, Semper&#x27;s first, was regarded as one of the most beautiful European opera houses.

Following a devastating fire in 1869, the citizens of Dresden immediately set about rebuilding their opera house. They demanded that Gottfried Semper do the reconstruction, even though he was then in exile because of his involvement in the May 1849 uprising in Dresden. The architect had his son, Manfred Semper, build the second opera house using his plans. Completed in 1878, it was built in Neo-Renaissance style. During construction, performances were held at the &quot;Gewerbehaussaal&quot;, which opened in 1870.

The building is considered a prime example of Baroque Revival architecture. It is situated on the Theatre Square in central Dresden on the bank of the Elbe River. On top of the portal there is a Panther quadriga with a statue of Dionysos. The interior was created by architects of the time, such as Johannes Schilling. Monuments on the portal depict artists, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Molière and Euripides. The building also features work by Ernst Rietschel and Ernst Julius Hähnel. In the pre-war years, the Semperoper premiered many of the works of Richard Strauss.


In 1945, during the last months of World War II, the building was largely destroyed again, this time by the bombing of Dresden and subsequent firestorm, leaving only the exterior shell standing. Exactly 40 years later, on 13 February 1985, the opera&#x27;s reconstruction was completed. It was rebuilt almost identically to its appearance before the war, but with the benefit of new stage machinery and an accompanying modern rear service building. The Semperoper reopened with the opera that was performed just before the building&#x27;s destruction in 1945, Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. When the Elbe flooded in 2002, the building suffered heavy water damage. With substantial help from around the world, it reopened in December of that year.

==Present-day administration and operations==
Today, the orchestra for most operas is the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden. The Generalmusikdirektor (GMD) of the Semperoper is normally a different conductor from that of the Staatskapelle when it presents concerts. Exceptions have been Karl Böhm, Hans Vonk, and Fabio Luisi who have held both positions. Whilst the Semperoper does not have a GMD as of 2015, the chief conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden was Christian Thielemann, as of the 2012/13 season. The current &quot;Intendant&quot; (General Manager) of the company is Wolfgang Rothe.

Since the 2018–2019 season, the &quot;Intendant&quot; of the Semperoper is Peter Theiler. In May 2021, his initial contract as &quot;Intendant&quot; was extended through the 2023–2024 season, at which time Theiler is scheduled to conclude his tenure in the post. In June 2021, the Semperoper announced the appointment of Nora Schmid as the incoming &quot;Intendantin&quot; of the company (the second woman to hold the post, after Ulrike Hessler), effective with the 2024–2025 season.

<text>In artillery, a grapeshot is a type of ammunition that consists of a collection of smaller-caliber round shots packed tightly in a canvas bag and separated from the gunpowder charge by a metal wadding, rather than being a single solid projectile. When assembled, the shot resembled a cluster of grapes, hence the name. Grapeshot was used both on land and at sea. On firing, the canvas wrapping disintegrates and the contained balls scatter out from the muzzle, giving a ballistic effect similar to a giant shotgun.

Grapeshot was devastatingly effective against massed infantry at short range and was also used at medium range. Solid shot was used at longer range and canister at shorter. When used in naval warfare, grapeshot served a dual purpose. First, it continued its role as an anti-personnel projectile. However, the effect was diminished due to a large portion of the crew being below decks and the addition of hammock netting in iron brackets intended to slow or stop smaller shot. Second, the shot was cast large enough to cut rigging, destroy spars and blocks, and puncture multiple sails.

Canister shot, also known as case shot, fired a larger number of smaller projectiles loosely packaged in a tin or brass container, possibly guided by a wooden sabot. The later shrapnel shell contained similarly smaller projectiles, and used a timed bursting charge to expel those projectiles from the front of the container.

Langrage is a type of improvised round that uses chain links, nails, shards of glass, rocks or other similar objects as the projectiles. Although langrage can be cheaply made, its ballistics are inferior to that of metal spheres.

<text>Kurt Busiek ( ; born September 16, 1960) is an American comic book writer. His work includes the &quot;Marvels&quot; limited series, his own series titled &quot;Astro City&quot;, a four-year run on &quot;The Avengers, Thunderbolts,&quot; and &quot;Superman.&quot;

==Early life==
Busiek was born in Boston. He grew up in various towns in the Boston area, including Lexington where he befriended future comic book creator Scott McCloud. Busiek did not read comics as a youngster, as his parents disapproved of them. He began to regularly read them around the age of 14, when he picked up a copy of &quot;Daredevil&quot; #120 (April 1975). That comic is the first part of a continuity-heavy four-part story arc; he was drawn to the copious history and cross-connections with other series. Throughout high school and college, he and McCloud practiced making comics. The pair contributed to comics hobbyist publications like NMP&#x27;s &quot;Comics Feature&quot;.

During that time, Busiek had many letters published in comic book letter columns and he started the theory that the Phoenix was a separate being who had impersonated Jean Grey, and that therefore Grey had not died—a premise which made its way from freelancer to freelancer, and which was eventually used in the comics. Busiek said, &quot;A couple of years later, after I’d broken in, I attended my first convention as a pro, in Ithaca, New York, and I stayed at Roger Stern&#x27;s house... we were talking about how much we liked the new &quot;X-Men&quot;, and he said, &#x27;It&#x27;s just a pity there&#x27;s no way to bring Jean Grey back&#x27;... I said, &#x27;Sure there&#x27;s a way, there&#x27;s always a way.&#x27;&quot;

==Career==
During the last semester of his senior year, Busiek submitted some sample scripts to editor Dick Giordano at DC Comics. None of them sold, but they got him invitations to pitch other material to DC editors, which led to his first professional work, a back-up story in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #162 (March 1983). After writing four fill-in issues of &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot;, he was given the series as his first regular assignment. He was a fan of the work of his predecessor, Mary Jo Duffy (she wrote &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot;) and emulated her lighthearted, humorous approach, not knowing that the editorial staff disapproved of that style and had taken Duffy off the series because of it. He was fired from the series for the same reasons as Duffy, after only six issues as its regular writer. In 1985, he wrote a &quot;Red Tornado&quot; limited series.

In 1993, Busiek and artist Alex Ross produced the &quot;Marvels&quot; limited series which comics historian Matthew K. Manning noted, &quot;reinvigorated painted comics as a genre, went on to become an acclaimed masterpiece, and spawned more than its own fair share of imitators.&quot; Busiek and Pat Olliffe crafted the &quot;Untold Tales of Spider-Man&quot; series beginning in September 1995. Busiek created the &quot;Thunderbolts&quot;, a group of super-villains disguised as super-heroes, with the final page of the first issue of the series revealing that the Thunderbolts were actually the Masters of Evil, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel. In February 1998, he launched &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 3 with penciler George Pérez and &quot;Iron Man&quot; vol. 3 with artist Sean Chen. Busiek and Carlos Pacheco collaborated on the &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; limited series in 1998–1999 which replaced the &quot;Avengers: World in Chains&quot; series on which the two had previously planned to work. 

Busiek continued as writer of &quot;The Avengers&quot; through 2002, collaborating with artists like Alan Davis and Kieron Dwyer. His tenure culminated with the &quot;Kang Dynasty&quot; storyline. In 2003, Busiek re-teamed with Pérez to create the &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; limited series. Busiek has worked on a number of different titles in his career including &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;, &quot;The Liberty Project&quot;, &quot;The Power Company&quot;, &quot;Shockrockets&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;JLA&quot;, and the award-winning &quot;Kurt Busiek&#x27;s Astro City&quot;. In the 1990s, work on some of Busiek&#x27;s more challenging, less mainstream projects, most notably &quot;Astro City&quot;, was repeatedly delayed by health problems brought about by mercury poisoning.

In 2004, Busiek began a new &quot;Conan&quot; series for Dark Horse Comics. In December 2005, he signed a two-year exclusive contract with DC Comics. After DC&#x27;s &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, he teamed with Geoff Johns on the eight-part story arc &quot;&quot; that ran in both Superman titles as part of DC&#x27;s company-wide &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline. In addition, he began writing the DC title &quot;Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis&quot; from issues #40–49. Busiek became the sole writer of the &quot;Superman&quot; series with issue #654 (Sept. 2006) and Carlos Pacheco became the series&#x27; artist. Busiek and Pacheco developed an extended storyline featuring Arion coming into conflict with Superman. The plotline concluded in &quot;Superman Annual&quot; #13. Busiek wrote a 52-issue weekly DC miniseries titled &quot;Trinity&quot; starring Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. Each issue except for the first featured a 12-page main story by Busiek, with art by Mark Bagley, and a ten-page backup story co-written by Busiek and Fabian Nicieza with art from various artists, including Tom Derenick, Mike Norton, and Scott McDaniel.

Busiek teamed with Alex Ross on Dynamite Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, an eight-issue miniseries which debuted in 2011. The series, which was their first full collaboration since &quot;Marvels&quot; 17 years previous, featured a large group of Jack Kirby&#x27;s creator-owned characters, the rights to which were acquired by Dynamite such as Silver Star, Captain Victory, Galaxy Green, Tiger 21 and the Ninth Men. Ross co-plotted, handled designs, and oversaw the series overall with Busiek, who scripted the story. In June 2013, Busiek relaunched his &quot;Astro City&quot; series as part of DC&#x27;s Vertigo line. Busiek commented that &quot;&quot;Astro City&quot;″s always been aimed at a more sophisticated reader, which I think suits Vertigo. Plus our backlist sales are closer to a Vertigo pattern than DCU.&quot; The ongoing &quot;Astro City&quot; series concluded as of issue #52 in 2018.

In April 2022, Busiek was reported to be one of more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing special projects editor Scott Dunbier, The profits were donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Busiek and Brent Anderson teamed up and contributed a new &quot;Astro City&quot; story to the anthology, which will harbor themes relevant to the events in Ukraine.

==Awards==
Busiek&#x27;s work has won him numerous awards in the comics industry, including the Harvey Award for Best Writer in 1998 and the Eisner Award for Best Writer in 1999. In 1994, with &quot;Marvels&quot;, he won Best Finite Series/Limited Series Eisner Award and the Best Continuing or Limited Series Harvey Award, as well as the Harvey Award for Best Single Issue or Story (for &quot;Marvels&quot; #4) in 1995. In 1996, with &quot;Astro City&quot;, he won both the Eisner and Harvey awards for Best New Series. He won the Best Single Issue/Single Story Eisner three years in a row from 1996 to 1998 for &quot;Astro City;&quot; for &quot;Conan: The Legend&quot; #0 in 2004. Busiek won the Best Continuing Series Eisner Award in 1997–1998, as well as the Best Serialized Story award in 1998. In addition, &quot;Astro City&quot; was awarded the 1996 Best Single Issue or Story Harvey Award, and the 1998 Harvey Award for Best Continuing or Limited Series.

Busiek was given the 1998 and 1999 &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; Awards for Favorite Writer, with additional nominations in 1997 and every year from 2000 to 2004. In 2010, he was given the Inkpot Award.

==Personal life==
Busiek is married to Ann Busiek. Both Kurt and Ann were rendered by Alex Ross as New Yorkers who react to the invasion of Silver Surfer and Galactus on page 17 of &quot;Marvels&quot; #3. Kurt is used later as the model for a wandering drunk on page 33 of the same issue.

In June 2022, Kurt Busiek revealed in the final issue of &quot;&quot; that the follow-up series &quot;&quot;, would be delayed due to his health. Specifically, he related that he had been suffering from persistent migraines for over a year, for which he was receiving Botox treatments every three months which reduced his productivity. He said that he was searching for a hospital with an advanced headache program where he could be placed.

<doc id="628014" wikidata="Q272380" url="?curid=628014" title="Lake Managua">
<text>Lake Managua (, ), also known as Lake Xolotlán (), is a freshwater lake in Nicaragua. At 1,042 km², it is approximately long and wide. Similarly to the name of Lake Nicaragua, its other name comes from the Nahuatl language, possibly from the Spanish Tlaxcaltec and Mexica allies but most likely from the Nicarao tribes that had already settled in the region. The city of Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, lies on its southwestern shore.

== Islands ==

There are two uninhabited lake islands:

* , a volcanic island. There is another nearby volcano, on the mainland: Momotombo.
* Isla Rosa, an islet

==Flooding==
The level of Lake Managua rises significantly during periods of heavy rain. The highest water level was recorded during the flooding of 1933.

The lake rose 3 metres (10 ft) in five days during Hurricane Mitch in 1998, destroying the homes of many who lived on its edge. An even higher flooding occurred in September/October 2010. Since then, the city has prohibited residential use of the most flood-prone areas, those with the elevation below 42.76 meters above sea level.

==Pollution==
Lake Managua was described by some authors as &quot;the most contaminated lake in Central America.&quot;
The lake had been severely polluted, mostly by decades of sewage being dumped into the lake. The city sewers have drained into the lake since 1927. It was only in 2009 that a modern wastewater treatment plant (built and operated by the British company Biwater) was opened in Managua, but even it treats only 40% of the city&#x27;s wastewater.

The lake today has no stable outlet, with only occasional floods to Lake Nicaragua through the Tipitapa River. Pollutants are thus concentrated. Despite the pollution, some of the people of Managua still live along the lake&#x27;s shores and eat the fish from it.

In 2007 the area was dredged, and the sediment hauled off on barges. A strong odor which permeated the area from the sediment disappeared. A stone rip-rap and concrete wharf was constructed, and a sightseeing boat called &quot;La Novia de Xolotlán&quot; makes hour-long lake tours when there are sufficient tourists.

Lake Managua was virtually dead, biologically speaking until a new wastewater treatment plant saved the lake and turned it into a recreational area for Nicaragua.

==Wildlife==
About 20 fish species still survive in Lake Managua.

While joined to Lake Nicaragua, the bull sharks of that lake cannot migrate to Lake Managua due to a waterfall on the Tipitapa River.

<text>Martín Erasto Torrijos Espino (; born July 18, 1963) is a Panamanian politician who was President of Panama from 2004 to 2009.

He was fathered out of wedlock by Panamanian military ruler Omar Torrijos, the &quot;de facto&quot; head of Panama from 1968 to 1981. Martín Torrijos was educated in economics and political science in the United States. He then returned to Panama, becoming active in the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). He was the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 1999 general election, losing to Arnulfista Party candidate Mireya Moscoso.

In the 2004 presidential election, he ran again as the PRD candidate. This time, his primary rival was Solidarity Party candidate Guillermo Endara, whom Torrijos defeated 47% to 31%. Torrijos reformed social security and pensions during his term in office, as well as proposing and passing a $5 billion expansion of the Panama Canal. Torrijos was succeeded by supermarket magnate Ricardo Martinelli in 2009. He is a member of the Inter-American Dialogue.

In the 2024 general elections, he is the presidential candidate for the Christian democratic People&#x27;s Party, one of the parties that supported him and formed part of his government.

== Early life and career ==
Martín Torrijos is the son of military ruler Omar Torrijos, who was Panama&#x27;s social reformer and military strongman from 1968 until his death in a 1981 plane crash. The younger Torrijos is an illegitimate child primarily raised by his mother, but his father publicly acknowledged him when he became a teenager. Born in Chitré, Herrera, he graduated from St. John&#x27;s Northwestern Military Academy located in Delafield, Wisconsin, in the United States and studied political science and economics at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas. During his time in the US, he also worked in Chicago, managing a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant.

During the presidency of Ernesto Pérez Balladares (1994–1999), Torrijos served as deputy minister for the interior and justice. His most significant act as deputy minister was to sign into law the complete privatization of Panama&#x27;s water utilities. When the new law proved unpopular, the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) effected a reversion to the previous system. During his term in office the rate of armed robberies and assault increased. There were several reported cases where SUNTRACS, a workers union, was angered, causing several riots which involved rock flinging.

== Presidential campaigns ==
After the failure of a constitutional referendum that would have allowed PRD incumbent Ernesto Pérez Balladares to seek a second consecutive term, Torrijos was named to represent the PRD in the 1999 general election. Torrijos was selected in part to try to win back left-leaning voters after the privatizations and union restrictions instituted by Pérez Balladares. His main opponent was Arnulfista Party candidate Mireya Moscoso, widow of former Panamanian president Arnulfo Arias, who had been deposed in the military coup that had brought Torrijos&#x27;s father Omar to power. Moscoso ran on a populist platform, beginning many of her speeches with the Latin phrase &quot;Vox populi, vox Dei&quot; (&quot;the voice of the people is the voice of God&quot;), previously used by Arias to begin his own speeches. She pledged to support education, reduce poverty, and slow the pace of privatization. While Torrijos ran in large part on his father&#x27;s memory—including using the campaign slogan &quot;Omar lives&quot;—Moscoso evoked that of her dead husband, leading Panamanians to joke that the election was a race between &quot;two corpses&quot;. Torrijos and the PRD were ultimately hampered by the corruption scandals of the previous administration, as well as a scandal in which &quot;La Prensa&quot; reported that two members of his campaign had been bribed by Mobil to sell a former US military base. Moscoso defeated Torrijos with 45% of the vote to 37%.

Torrijos ran again in the 2004 presidential election on a platform of strengthening democracy and negotiating a free trade agreement with the US, and was supported by popular musician and politician Rubén Blades; Torrijos later made Blades the nation&#x27;s tourism minister. Torrijos&#x27; primary rival was Guillermo Endara, who had served as president from 1990 to 1994. Endara ran as the candidate of the Solidarity Party, on a platform of reducing crime and government corruption. Endara and the other candidates also ran a series of negative ads highlighting the PRD&#x27;s connections with former military ruler Manuel Noriega. Endara finished second in the race, receiving 31% of the vote to Torrijos&#x27; 47%.

Shortly before leaving office, Moscoso sparked controversy by pardoning four men—Luis Posada Carriles, Gaspar Jiménez, Pedro Remon and Guillermo Novo Sampol—who had been convicted of plotting to assassinate Cuban president Fidel Castro during a 2000 visit to Panama. Cuba broke off diplomatic relations with the country, and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez recalled the nation&#x27;s ambassador. Moscoso stated that the pardons had been motivated by her mistrust of Torrijos, saying, &quot;I knew that if these men stayed here, they would be extradited to Cuba and Venezuela, and there they were surely going to kill them there.&quot;

== Presidency (2004–2009) ==

In May 2005, the Torrijos government proposed increasing pension contributions and raising the retirement age to help pay off the nation&#x27;s increasing foreign debt. The changes triggered several weeks of protests, strikes, and a student-led closure of the University of Panama, and the proposal to increase the retirement age was postponed. Following opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and union leaders, Torrijos also initially postponed plans to reform social security, though he successfully passed a reform measure later in his term.

Torrijos&#x27;s temporary unpopularity forced him also postpone plans for widening the Panama Canal until 2006. In April of that year, he presented a plan, calling it &quot;probably the most important decision of this generation&quot;. The expansion was projected to double the canal&#x27;s shipping capacity and allow it to handle oil tankers and cruise ships, at a projected cost of $5 billion. The plan was approved by public referendum on October 22 of that year with 78% of the vote.

In November 2006, Torrijos sponsored the Latin American and Caribbean Congress in Solidarity with Puerto Rico&#x27;s Independence in favor of Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence and made an energetic call to the United States to recognise the independence of Puerto Rico. His administration opposed Colombian president Alvaro Uribe&#x27;s proposals to build a road through the undeveloped Darién Gap connecting the countries, stating that it could damage ecotourism in the region.

In 2007, Torrijos negotiated the Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement with the administration of George W. Bush. Though ratified in Panama and apparently headed to ratification in the US, the agreement was derailed in September 2007 when fellow PRD member Pedro Miguel González Pinzón was elected President of the National Assembly. González Pinzón had been indicted by a US grand jury for the 1992 murder of US Army Sgt. Zak Hernández, and some members of the US Congress vowed to oppose the pact until González Pinzón no longer held the post. Unwilling to publicly battle his party&#x27;s nationalist wing, Torrijos privately asked González Pinzón to resign, but avoided criticizing him in the press. The deal was finally ratified under Torrijos&#x27;s successor, Ricardo Martinelli.

Torrijos was again popular by the end of his term, but because Panama&#x27;s constitution forbids consecutive second terms for the presidency, the PRD nominated Balbina Herrera as a candidate to succeed him in 2009. She lost to an independent candidate, Ricardo Martinelli, the owner of a supermarket chain.

<doc id="628019" wikidata="Q1207703" url="?curid=628019" title="Jungle gym">
<text>A jungle gym (called a climbing frame in British English) is a piece of playground equipment made of many pieces of material, such as metal pipes or ropes, on which participants can climb, hang, sit, and—in some configurations—slide. Monkey bars are a part of a jungle gym where a user, hanging in the air, swings between evenly spaced horizontal bars. In Australian English, the term &quot;monkey bars&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the entire jungle gym.

==History==

The first jungle gym was invented in 1920 and patented by lawyer Sebastian Hinton in Chicago. It was sold under the trademarked name Junglegym. Hinton&#x27;s second prototype &quot;jungle gym&quot; is still standing at the Winnetka Historical Society where it was relocated from the Crow Island School in Winnetka, Illinois. The term &quot;monkey bars&quot; appears at least as far back as the 1930s, though Hinton&#x27;s initial 1920 patent appeals to the &quot;monkey instinct&quot; in claiming the benefits of climbing as exercise and play for children, and his improvement patents later that year refer to monkeys shaking the bars of a cage, children swinging on a &quot;monkey runway&quot;, and the game of &quot;monkey tag&quot;.

When Sebastian Hinton was a child, his father, mathematician Charles Hinton, had built a similar structure from bamboo with the goal of enabling children to gain an intuitive understanding of three-dimensional space through a game in which numbers for the x, y, and z axes were called out, and each child tried to be the first to grasp the indicated junction. Thus, the abstraction of Cartesian coordinates could be grasped as a name of a tangible point in space.

==Safety==
To reduce the risk of injury from falls, jungle gym areas often have a thick layer of woodchips, sand or other impact-absorbing material covering the ground. The American National Safety Council recommends that playgrounds have at least of such material.

<doc id="628022" wikidata="Q3024366" url="?curid=628022" title="Desert Battle Dress Uniform">
<text>The Desert Battle Dress Uniform (DBDU) is a U.S. arid-environment camouflage battle uniform that was used by the United States Armed Forces from the early 1980s to the early to mid 1990s, most notably during the Persian Gulf War. Although the U.S. military has long since abandoned the pattern, it is still in widespread use by militaries across the world as of the early 2020s.

==Appearance==
The Desert Battle Dress Uniform was designed in 1970 and uses a camouflage pattern known as the Six-Color Desert Pattern or colloquially as Chocolate-Chip Camouflage and Cookie Dough Camouflage. The camouflage received its nickname because it resembles chocolate-chip cookie dough. It is made up of a base pattern of light tan overlaid with broad swathes of pale green and wide two-tone bands of brown. Clusters of black and white spots are scattered over, to mimic the appearance of pebbles and their shadows.

==History==

Although the chocolate-chip camouflage became well known during the Persian Gulf War, it was originally designed decades prior, in 1962. The U.S. Army, believing that it might one day become necessary to intervene in the Arab–Israeli conflicts, developed a test pattern using the deserts of the southwestern United States as a model. When the hostilities in the Middle East wound down, the test pattern was mothballed. The formation of the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) in 1979, with its remit to operate in the Middle East, and protect U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region, saw the need for desert camouflage clothing to emerge again.

===U.S. Army===

With limited issuing dating back to the 1980 mission to the rescue American hostages in Iran, the DBDU was unique, in that when it was officially issued in 1981, the 6-color desert pattern was only issued in limited numbers to division personnel like the U.S. 82nd Airborne or 101st Airborne who deployed to Egypt and the Sinai desert to participate in the &quot;Bright Star&quot; exercise in December 1980. The DBDU was the U.S. Army&#x27;s first fully functional desert combat pattern from 1981 to 1992.

===U.S. Marine Corps===
Like the Army, the DBDU was seldom issued whenever Marines were deployed to participate in the &quot;Bright Star&quot; exercises, but became their standard arid combat uniform by 1985. The 6-color desert pattern was used by the U.S. Marine Corps from 1982 to 1995.

===U.S. Air Force===
First issued in 1982 for their participation and deployments to arid regions, the DBDU became the United States Air Forces primary desert uniform from 1982 to 1993.

===U.S. Navy===
Like its sister branches, The Navy began limited issue of the DBDU in the early 80s and became standard wide by 1985. It would remain the Navy&#x27;s main desert combat uniform from the early &#x27;80s to the mid &#x27;90s.

===U.S. Coast Guard===
The Coast Guard was the last branch to see remaining issue of the DBDU in the mid to late 1980s.

===Operational use===
The six-color desert pattern entered service in 1981 at the same time as the woodland BDUs and would be worn in limited numbers by U.S. troops taking part in the biennial Bright Star exercises in Egypt during the 1980s, and by FORSCOM peacekeepers assigned to the Multinational Force and Observers in the Egyptian Sinai Desert, but was not issued in large numbers prior to the Persian Gulf War. However, there is evidence that the six-color desert pattern camouflage was in use before 1981 with photographs of American military personnel involved in Operation Eagle Claw in April 1980 using this camouflage pattern in the failed attempt to rescue U.S. embassy staff being held hostage in Iran.

The pattern was unpopular with American soldiers during the Gulf War. Feedback from these users indicated that the design contrasted too much with the terrain, preventing the camouflage from blending in effectively. Anecdotal evidence suggested that the dark areas of the pattern warmed up more than the paler parts under desert sunlight, and retained the heat longer. The six colors were also more expensive to manufacture than three or four colors, and the need for a camouflage that would be suitable for use in any desert resulted in a requirement for a new desert camouflage uniform. The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center began the search for a substitute. Samples of sand and earth from the Middle East were measured for optical and infrared reflectance, and seven trial patterns were created using these statistics. The patterns were evaluated in fourteen different desert locations and narrowed down to one favorite. The resulting &quot;Desert Camouflage Pattern: Combat&quot; was standardized in 1990, but was not ready before troops deployed to Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf War. Consequently, U.S. forces wore the six-color BDUs during the campaign. During that war, after initiatives by General Norman Schwarzkopf, the six-color Desert BDU was produced in 100% cotton poplin without reinforcement panels in order to improve comfort in hot desert conditions. A total of 500,000 improved cotton BDUs were ordered. However, cost concerns caused the cotton six-color Desert BDU to be discontinued shortly after the Persian Gulf War.

===Replacement===
An initial batch of desert BDUs in the new camouflage scheme was en route to the Middle East when hostilities ceased. The pattern, officially issued with the newer Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) in the early 1990s, consisted of a subtle blend of large pastel green and light tan shapes, with sparsely placed, narrow, reddish brown patches, leading the design to be unofficially nicknamed the “Coffee Stain” pattern.

Both patterns were briefly used together during the transition period, most notably during Operation Restore Hope and Operation Gothic Serpent (some U.S. Army Rangers during the latter occasionally wore the newer three-color DCU&#x27;s along with kevlar helmet covers retaining the old six-color pattern. The same dress was also worn by soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi in 2001). During Operation Bright Star 1995, Third Army personnel wore the three-color uniform while troops from Fort Bragg (330th MCC) wore the six-color uniform for the 75-day exercise. In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the U.S. military did not use the DBDU, and instead mostly used the DCU&#x27;s tri-color pattern and to a lesser extent, the MARPAT camouflage pattern.

==Legacy==

As of the early 2010s, the chocolate-chip pattern is still in widespread use across the world, long after the United States abandoned it. A uniform similar to the Desert Battle Dress Uniform was issued to the Iraqi National Guard before it was dissolved in 2004 and to the Iraqi security forces. 

South Korean forces have used, in limited numbers since 1993, a variant with brown replacing the black in the original U.S. design; this South Korean design has also been tested in the United Arab Emirates. 

The Oman National Guard use a pattern mixing chocolate-chip with &#x27;amoeba&#x27;, while the National Guards of both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait use a grey variation on the chocolate-chip design. The Saudis also use a grey, black, and white &#x27;urban&#x27; variation and the police wear a blue version of the same design; Palestinian police also use a blue chocolate-chip patterned uniform. 

The South African &quot;Soldier 2000&quot; pattern is similar to the U.S. design. A copy of the pattern, using tan, medium brown, bottle-green and greyish green, in addition to the black-on-white pebbles, is used in Kazakhstan.

<text>The &quot;Protecteur&quot;-class auxiliary oiler replenishment (AOR) ships were used by the Royal Canadian Navy to resupply ships at sea with food, munitions, fuel and spare parts. They had more sophisticated medical and dental facilities than smaller warships. At the ships were some of the largest operated by the RCN. Entering service in 1969, the last vessel of the class was paid off in 2016.

==General characteristics==
The &quot;Protecteur&quot;-class replenishment oilers were long, wide, and displaced up to a maximum of when fully loaded. Powered by two Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, feeding a single General Electric steam turbine engine, the ships reached a maximum speed of . At 20 knots, the range of the &quot;Protecteur&quot; class was limited to , but could be extended to when only traveling at . The &quot;Protecteur&quot; class could safely navigate in as little as of water.

&quot;Protecteur&quot;-class oilers carried a crew of three hundred and sixty five men and women, including 27 officers, and 45 air detachment personnel who operated and supported three embarked CH-124 Sea King helicopters. The crew was also responsible for loading and unloading the cargo of the &quot;Protecteur&quot; class, which included up to of fuel, of aviation fuel, of dry cargo, and of ammunition.

Two 20 mm Phalanx close-in weapon system points and six .50 calibre machine guns helped protect the cargo and crew of the &quot;Protecteur&quot; class if their BAE Systems Mark 36 SRBOC chaff launchers or AN/SLQ-25 Nixie towed decoy did not prevent enemy weaponry from endangering the ship.

==Ships in class==
The Royal Canadian Navy listed the following two ships in the &quot;Protecteur&quot; class. Both ships were built by Saint John Shipbuilding.

==Retirement and future==
On 19 September 2014, Vice-Admiral Mark Norman of the Royal Canadian Navy announced the retirement of both &quot;Protecteur&quot; and &quot;Preserver&quot;, along with the s and . General wear and tear notwithstanding, &quot;Protecteur&quot; was involved in a very serious engine room fire in February 2014 and more recently corrosion problems were found on &quot;Preserver&quot;. On 27 November 2015, &quot;Protecteur&quot; and &quot;Algonquin&quot; were sold to R.J. MacIsaac Ltd. of Antigonish, Nova Scotia for scrapping. They were towed to Liverpool, Nova Scotia, where the vessels were to be broken up. &quot;Preserver&quot; was paid off on 21 October 2016.

Plans for replacing the class were first introduced in 2004. Lack of spare parts for the boilers and the fact that the &quot;Protecteur&quot; class are monohull tankers were the main driving points to replacing the class. The ships were intended to continue to operate until 2017, however, the Joint Support Ship Project will not be completed until two years later, leaving a gap in the ability for the RCN to refuel and resupply her own ships while deployed.

The Royal Canadian Navy looked at other options to fill the gap until the arrival of the two s in 2019 at the earliest. The navy is currently leasing replenishment vessels from other navies, and converted a civilian container ship to a replenishment vessel.

<text>Samuel Thomson (9 February 1769 – 5 October 1843) was a self-taught American herbalist and botanist, best known as the founder of the alternative system of medicine known as &quot;Thomsonian Medicine&quot; or &quot;Thomsonianism&quot;, which enjoyed wide popularity in the United States during the early 19th century.

==Early life==
Thomson was born in Alstead, New Hampshire, the second-eldest of six children. His father, John Thomson, was a farmer and the family lived in a remote country area which Thomson described as a &quot;wilderness&quot;. Both of his parents were Unitarians.

From a young age he became curious about the various plants which he saw growing in the countryside and their medicinal uses. Much of his early knowledge was acquired from a local widow woman, who had acquired a reputation as a healer because of her skill with herbal remedies. Thomson also used to sample the plants he found growing in the wild—in this way he discovered Lobelia, which became an important remedy in the system of medicine he later founded. Unaware of the medicinal properties of the plant, Thomson used to trick other boys into eating it, which caused them to vomit because of its emetic nature.
At the age of sixteen he had hoped to study with a local &quot;root&quot; doctor (at that time there was no official licensing of the medical profession) but his parents did not think he had the education and could not spare him from his work. Thus, he became resigned to his life as a farm laborer. At the age of nineteen, while he was chopping wood, his ankle sustained a severe injury which, despite the ministration of a local doctor, refused to heal. His condition worsened and the family feared for his life. He decided to treat the wound himself with a comfrey root and turpentine plaster—after some weeks he was able to make a recovery.

At the age of 21, Samuel&#x27;s father left for Vermont, placing Samuel in charge of the farm and leaving his mother and sister in his care. Soon after, his mother became ill with measles, and in spite of the efforts of several doctors, Samuel&#x27;s mother died when the measles turned into &quot;galloping consumption&quot;. When Samuel also became ill with measles, he cured himself using herbal remedies.

One year later, Thomson married Susanna Allen on July 7, 1790, in Keene, New Hampshire. After the birth of their first child, Susanna became very ill, and a parade of seven conventional doctors were unable to cure her. Samuel arranged for two &quot;root doctors&quot; to treat his wife, who returned to health the next day. Thomson and Susanna went on to have eight children.

==Development of the Thomsonian System==

During his wife&#x27;s illness, Thomson consulted two herbalists, who treated his wife and taught Thomson some of their methods. Subsequently, Thomson used steam baths and herbs to cure one of his daughters and a son, and a few of his neighbors.

In this way, Thomson developed his own method, the &quot;Thomsonian System&quot;, and practiced in Surry, New Hampshire, and the adjoining towns. During the first half of the 19th century, his system had numerous followers, including some of his sons. It was based upon opening the paths of elimination so that toxins could be removed via physiological processes. This was not unique to Thomson: so-called &quot;regular physicians&quot; used calomel, a toxic mercury-based compound, to induce vomiting and purgation. Thomson&#x27;s more moderate and less toxic means attracted large numbers of followers.

Displeased with the conventional medicines and enthusiastic about the results he had had by means of his system, he proposed it as a natural alternative, stating:
Much of what is at this day called medicine, is deadly poison, and were people to know what is offered them of this kind they would absolutely refuse ever to receive it as a medicine. This I have long seen and known to be true; and have laboured hard for many years to convince them of the evils that attend such a mode of procedure with the sick; and have turned my attention to those medicines that grow in our own country, which the God of nature has prepared for the benefit of mankind. Long has a general medicine been sought for, and I am confident I have found such as are universally applicable in all cases of disease, and which may be used with safety and success, in the hands of the people.After thirty years study and repeated successful trials of the medicinal vegetables of our country, in all the diseases incident to our climate; I can, with well grounded assurance, recommend my system of practice and medicines to the public, as salutary and efficacious.


Eventually, Thomson came to believe that the exposure to cold temperatures was an important cause of illness and that disease should be treated by restoring the body&#x27;s natural heat. Thomson&#x27;s methods for doing this included steam baths, the use of cayenne pepper, laxatives, and administration of the emetic &quot;Lobelia inflata&quot; (also known as &quot;Indian tobacco&quot; or &quot;puke weed&quot;).

Thomson&#x27;s book called &quot;New Guide to Health; or Botanic Family Physician&quot; (1822), suggested home-made preparations and contempt for conventional medicine which he regarded to be as very expensive:
Moreover, his system of medicine appealed to the egalitarian anti-elitist sentiments of Jacksonian America in the 1830s, and families far from established towns came to rely on it. At that time, licensed doctors and many of their methods such as bloodletting came under intense scrutiny, so Thomson&#x27;s innovative system was presented as an appealing alternative that allowed each individual (working classes included) to administer his or her own treatment using natural products. A favorable opinion of his system was given by the contemporary physician Daniel Drake, who perceived him as an American medical reformist:
Another opinion by botanist William Hance was given before the Botanic Society in Columbus, Ohio, where Hance said of him:
The science of medicine is confessed by the best men who have ever honored its splendid halls, or enlightened its mazy paths, to be in a very imperfect state; then why should we reject or condemn, without a close examination, a theory and practice merely because they are new or novel? There has been an almost continued succession of new and novel things, since the creation; and yet our knowledge as well as the improvement of our intellectual faculties remain very imperfect. I do not pretend to say, that Dr. Thomson&#x27;s Theory or Practice of Medicine is in a state of perfection; but I do say and believe, that they approach nearer to this state than any other with which I am acquainted, or that I have reason to believe is known to, or practiced by, the Medical Faculty of America or Europe.

==Reception==

Despite Thomson&#x27;s popularity, some licensed doctors came to resent his work, and he was criticized for his techniques. On the one hand, some people who received his training broke with him and went on to pursue advanced medical education, founding physiomedicalism, while on the other hand, some of his former apprentices like Miler Comings, acknowledged him as an early great mentor. His detractors like John Brown accused him of lack of anatomical and physiological knowledge, and they attributed Thomson&#x27;s downfall to a reluctance to interact more with doctors.

==Legalities and legal charges==

In 1809, Thomson was accused of killing a patient, Ezra Lovett, through the administration of excessive amounts of &quot;Lobelia&quot;. He was legally charged by Lovett&#x27;s father, but Thomson was acquitted when one of his defense counsel demonstrated that one of the prosecution&#x27;s exhibits, labeled &quot;Lobelia&quot;, was actually the plant marsh rosemary (&quot;Limonium&quot;), by consuming some in court. Also, the judge found no basis to establish Thomson&#x27;s fault or negligence. Subsequent literature reviews have failed to demonstrate any deaths or symptoms more dangerous than emesis from even significantly larger doses than Thomson administered in the Ezra Lovett case; but, medical reviews about Thomson&#x27;s trial were diverse at the time, sometimes very critical. Thomson, however, gave his own account of this case in two of his later books, where he wrote that first he had helped the young man get better, but after carelessness at home, he told the father to seek someone else, though the father refused:

I told the young man’s father, that it was very doubtful whether I could do any thing that would help him, but that I would try and do all I could. I found that the patient was so far gone that the medicine would have no effect, and in two hours told him that I could not help his son, and advised him to call some other advice; this was said in the presence of Elder Williams, and Mr. Raymond. Mr. Lovett made answer that if I could not help his son, he knew of none who could, and was very desirous for me to stay with him all night, which I did, and stood by his bed the whole time.

Nonetheless, and despite Thomson&#x27;s acquittal, many states passed &quot;Black Laws&quot;, restricting the practice of unconventional medicine. Black laws were labeled as such by unconventional medical practitioners as a way of comparing them with laws restricting African Americans from practicing medicine and engaging in other activities. The laws were of small practical effect and were mostly repealed by the 1820s. Thomson saw this as an attempt to destroy his personal career, as he had denounced some of the medical techniques of the time, in 1839, he wrote:

For more than twenty years the Faculty tried to destroy the Thomsonian system by holding it up as a quackery. In Massachusetts, they began in 1808 to get the Legislature to help them put me down, and in that State and many others, laws have been passed since that time to prevent my collecting my debts, and to make medical practice, without a college diploma, a crime. But in nearly every State where these unjust laws were passed, the people have caused them to be repealed.

In 1839, he was taken again to court, blamed for Paine D. Badger&#x27;s use of his system. Thomson himself published a &quot;Report of the trial of Dr. Samuel Thomson, the founder of the Thomsonian practice, for an alleged libel in warning the public against the impositions of Paine D. Badger, as a Thomsonian physician sailing under false colors, before Judge Thacher&quot; (1839), where he expressed that he was worried about the use other people could do under his name. Partly because of this, he took great care to guard his patented cures, and used legal authority to prevent others from manufacturing and selling lobelia pills, for instance. He sold rights to use his system of medicine to any family for $20. Right-holders were able to purchase Thomson&#x27;s herbs and formulas, which he distributed from a central warehouse, and a copy of Thomson&#x27;s book. He had sold over 100,000 patents by 1840, but this consortium was broken by Alva Curtis, who created the &quot;Independent Thomsonian Medical Society&quot; to train practitioners.

Illustrating another case, Thomson wrote:
Almost every newspaper from abroad brings the name of some person setting up as a Thomsonian Doctor and passing as my agent, of whom I know nothing and who knows nothing of my system or medicines from me. A man calling himself Benjamin Thomson has just opened in Alexandria, District of Columbia, and advertises in the National Intelligencer. I know nothing of what he may do under color of my name and I wish the people there to understand it and not lay any blame to the Thomsonian system for any thing he may do...Among those who have been or are using my name and medicines without any authority from me are Charles Holman, Portsmouth, N. H.; John A. Brown, Providence, R. I.; G. Larabee at Baltimore; Clark &amp; Wilder at Randolph, Mass.

Herbalist Michael Moore, gives a flavor criticism of the debate of the times, stating that Thomson&#x27;s own perception of the controversies was &quot;couched in seeming venal paranoia&quot;, and that:
Thomson&#x27;s movement had affected a million or more Americans, started a medical reformation that would not peak for another 50 years, and the brightest medical minds of the time were split vehemently both against and for Thomson&#x27;s right to practice...bitterly divided between Federalists and Republican politics...Populists and Elitists...rural and urban. The tribulations of this former pig farmer rocked the young republic for over a decade and were headlines everywhere. Because of the success of Thomson and his followers, states began, for the first time, regulating medical practice along party and class lines. Messy and fascinating stuff.

Notably, the eclectic herbalist John Uri Lloyd, in his introduction to the edition of &quot;Life and medical discoveries of Samuel Thomson&quot;, states that Thomson was involved in William Morgan&#x27;s Anti-masonic controversy in New York, and argues that he was thus persecuted in part for political reasons:

One can not now easily enter into the problems of that day concerning medicine and the practice of medicine. The passion, the dogmatism, the vituperation of the period, the suppression of free thought and investigation outside authority, is a something that can not now be expressed or readily appreciated... he was involved by Mr. Locke in the famous Morgan Masonic controversy, the raging in New York. This leads us to state than a share, and possible no small proportion, of Thomson&#x27;s troubles, came also from his pronounced political activity, at a time when in American politics no toleration whatever was exhibited by one party for an adherent of the opposite political faith... Thomson&#x27;s allegiance to the minority party of that date led to much of his persecution.

Thomson&#x27;s system, however, was still well received by people like William Renwick Riddell in Canada; his main work passing through 13 editions, and also finding German advocates who translated his main work into the German language.

Thomson&#x27;s ultimate position about his own system was stated four years before his death, when he wrote:

<text>The Royal Canadian Air Cadets () is a Canadian national youth program for young individuals aged 12 to 18. Under the authority of the National Defence Act, the program is administered by the Canadian Forces (CF) and funded through the Department of National Defence (DND). Additional support is provided by the civilian Air Cadet League of Canada (ACLC). Together with the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and Royal Canadian Army Cadets, it forms the &quot;largest federally funded youth program in the country&quot;. Cadets are not members of the military and are not obliged to join the Canadian Armed Forces.

The first squadrons were established in 1941 to train young men for duties during World War II. Today the focus is on general aviation within the aim: &quot;To instill in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership; promote physical fitness; and stimulate an interest in the activities of the Canadian Forces.&quot;

The majority of cadet training takes place at the local squadron during the regular school year, with a percentage of cadets selected for summer training courses across Canada. Central to the air cadet program are the gliding and flying courses offered to air cadets who qualify. One in five private pilots in Canada is an ex-air cadet, and 67% of commercial and airline pilots began their careers as an air cadet. There are 454 squadrons located across the country with enrolment of over 26,000 Air Cadets.

== Overview ==
The aim of the Cadet Program is to develop in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership; promote physical fitness; and stimulate the interest of youth in the sea, land, and air activities of the Canadian Forces; however, each focuses on its own parent element. The Air Cadet motto is &quot;To learn. To serve. To advance.&quot;, and was created by Robert Myles Colwell in 1966 when he was a cadet with 625 Squadron in Perth-Andover, New Brunswick. In keeping with Commonwealth custom, the Royal Canadian Air Cadets stand last in the order of precedence, after the Royal Canadian Sea and Army Cadets.

Those aged 12 to 18 (inclusive) may become an air cadet. The organization and rank structure of the Royal Canadian Air Force is used with the exceptions of Flight Corporal (in place of Master Corporal), Flight Sergeant (in place of Warrant Officer), Warrant Officer 2nd class (in place of Master Warrant Officer)and Warrant Officer 1st Class (in place of Chief Warrant Officer). Cadets are not members of the Canadian Forces, and there is no expectation for cadets to join the Canadian Forces upon graduation from the program, though cadets who do go on to join the Canadian Forces may be granted up to 180 days of incentive credit towards the Private IPC 2 pay category.

Adult leadership is provided by members of the Canadian Forces Reserve subcomponent Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service, composed mostly of officers of the Cadet Instructors Cadre (CIC) and supplemented, if necessary, by contracted civilian instructors, authorized civilian volunteers, and, on occasion, officers and non-commissioned members of other CF branches. The CIC is specifically trained to deliver the Royal Canadian Sea, Army, and Air Cadet training program. Some are former cadets, and many have former regular or reserve force service.

The Canadian Cadet Organization is sponsored in partnership by the CF/DND and the civilian Air Cadet League, along with the Navy League and Army Cadet League. Each cadet unit is supported by a local squadron sponsoring committee responsible to the national League through each of the provincial committees. The basic Air Cadet program is provided at no cost, including uniforms and activities. Many Air Cadet squadrons are sponsored locally by a service organization or club such as a Royal Canadian Legion Branch, Royal Canadian Air Force Association Wing, Rotary Club, Lions Club, others are supported by a locally established committee often composed of parents of cadets. Civilian sponsors raise money for accommodations, utilities, liability insurance, local awards, and additional training resources or special activities, such as mess dinners, band instruments, or squadron excursions and trips that are not funded by the CF/DND. Cadets and their parents are encouraged to participate in fund-raising activities, such as selling paper tags or poppies.

== History ==
The Air Cadet Organization originated in the early days of World War II when the war effort required young men to meet Canada&#x27;s military obligations.
By 1938 there existed a couple of groups that would help promote such an effort. In Winnipeg, Manitoba this was the Winnipeg Air Cadets launched by Albert Bennett. Other such groups existed in St. Catharines, ON and in Penhold, AB.

Prior to 1940, official Air Cadet squadrons did not exist. However, in 1939 Alan Duncan Bell-Irving and A.W. (Nick) Carter formed the 1601 Air Force Cadet Wing in Vancouver. This Squadron was operated directly by the Department of National Defence in association with the No. 111 Squadron of the RCAF, which was stationed in Vancouver at the time. A.W. (Nick) Carter became the first commanding officer of the 1601 Wing until he was called to Ottawa to assist in the formation of the new Air Cadet League of Canada. After the formation of the Air Cadet League of Canada the 1601 Wing was chartered to the League and became 111 Vancouver Squadron. The 111 Air Cadet Squadron still exists and parades at Bessborough Armoury in Vancouver under the name 111 Pegasus Squadron.

In 1940, Air Minister Power directed that a nationwide voluntary organization be formed to sponsor and develop a select group of young men who would be trained to meet the increasing need for operational pilots in the RCAF during World War II.

On November 11, 1940, an Order-in-Council was passed to establish the Air Cadet League of Canada to work in partnership with the RCAF. The first squadrons were organized in 1941 and by 1942 there were 135 squadrons and 10,000 cadets, mostly recruited from the Army Cadets. By 1943, there were 315 squadrons with a membership of 23,000. In 1944, the program reached its peak membership with 29,000 cadets in 374 squadrons.

The first uniform the Air Cadets used were hand-me-down uniforms from the Pre-War era RCAF. It consisted of a blue/gray wool uniform; cap (wedge), pants and a full collar tunic. This was phased out in 1943 with an open collar variation similar to the war time RCAF enlisted man&#x27;s tunic. After the war the air cadet organization received more hand me down uniforms from the RCAF before adopting the battle dress style uniform.

After the war, membership dropped to a low of 11,000 in 155 squadrons and the Air Cadet program underwent a transformation to reflect the changing needs of Canada and the cadets. The Air Cadet League introduced awards for proficiency and loyalty to the squadrons, summer courses were offered at RCAF stations, and a flying scholarship course was developed. To date, more than 15,000 cadets have received their private pilot licence through the scholarship course. Training shifted to be focused on the development of citizenship and an interest in aviation. Interest was renewed; by 1961, 332 squadrons were in existence and in 1972, authority was given for membership of up to 28,000 cadets.

In 1953, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was appointed the organization&#x27;s Air Commodore-in-Chief, a position he held until his death in 2021.

In areas where there was a high interest in air cadets, additional squadrons were established with different parade nights to accommodate the numbers. These squadrons were often placed into air cadet wings (a formation of two or more squadrons) with a separate wing HQ staff of both officers and senior cadets overseeing the operation. The system was discontinued in the late 1960s and all squadrons became independent once again.

From the early days senior air cadets were given opportunities to work in staff positions beside officers, certain contracted civilians and RCAF/CF members at summer camps across Canada. A system was developed where senior cadets aged 16 or older were temporarily enrolled in the RCAF/CF on short-term contracts and given the rank of Acting Corporal. They were referred to as Call-out Corporals. The Senior Leaders Course at Cold Lake later even used the CF rank of Acting Master Corporal among its staff of Call-out Corporals. Later the system was abolished and the &quot;staff cadet&quot; program selected senior cadets for advanced training who were appointed as staff cadets to assist the adult leadership.

With the unification of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army and the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1968, the Canadian Forces became the Air Cadet League&#x27;s military partner in the delivery of air cadet training. In 1975, legislation was changed to officially allow the enrolment of female cadets into the Royal Canadian Sea, Army, and Air Cadets. The &quot;battle dress&quot; style woollen air force blue uniform was changed to a CF rifle green safari style uniform. The style and weight were more suited to the indoor and summer training reality of the program. The first of these was issued to cadet squadrons commencing in 1978. A new embellished brass cap badge was issued and air cadet wings were worn on the left breast rather than the right. When the CF went back to separate uniform colours in the mid-1980s, cadets followed again with a new air force blue cadet uniform being issued but following the same style as the outgoing green uniform. Squadrons received these new uniforms commencing in the fall of 1992.

Today, the Royal Canadian Air Cadets has a membership of approximately 23,000 in 456 squadrons; and together with the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and Royal Canadian Army Cadets, forms the &quot;largest federally funded youth program in the country&quot;. The membership has also diversified, becoming gender balanced and attracting and retaining visible minorities.

== Local training ==

Each squadron trains one night per week—a &quot;parade night&quot;—to undertake the local training program. The course of instruction is prescribed by the Director of Cadets and outlined in course training plans distributed to each squadron. The six-year program provides cadets instruction in citizenship, leadership, survival training, instructional techniques, drill and ceremonial and the basics of aviation and aeronautics. In the fifth and subsequent years, cadets may be assigned to instruct these classes to the younger cadets. The local training begins in September and continues until June.

In addition to the mandatory weekly training syllabus, there are additional regularly scheduled activities that cadets can participate in optional training that includes band, firearms safety and marksmanship using the 10 metre air rifle for both training and competition, biathlon, military drill practice, first aid training, and competitions, and ground school instruction in preparation for glider pilot and private pilot training courses. Many of these activities also involve regional, provincial, or national competitions between teams and individual cadets. Throughout the year there are weekend exercises organized by the local squadrons. Survival exercises, participation in Remembrance Day ceremonies, and familiarization flights, are all activities in which cadets may participate at various points throughout the training year. Some cadet squadrons participate in community events such as parades and band concerts.

=== Cadet Program Update – Squadron program ===
Beginning with the 2008/2009 training year, a new training system was introduced replacing the program that was in use since 1992. The Cadet Program Update (CPU) brings new teaching materials and incorporates more contemporary educational and youth development methods. Similar updates to the Sea and Army Cadet programs rationalize the connectivity between the three programs and more efficiently provides the training that is common to all three elements.

The cornerstone of the CPU is the recognition that people between the ages of 12-18 pass through three basic &quot;Developmental Periods&quot; (DPs). These DPs mark the development of their cognitive abilities from a purely experienced-based (i.e. &quot;hands-on&quot;) method of learning to abstract problem-solving and competency. The training methods used at each training level reflect the target age group of the cadets in that training level.

The delivery of the various performance objectives (POs) will be through a mixture of mandatory and complementary enabling objectives (EOs). The mandatory EOs will be the same for all air cadet squadrons. Individual squadrons may choose from a number of complementary EOs to support the mandatory training. The selection of complementary training activities at a local squadron is based on the local resources and the interests of the cadets involved.

The program will be phased in one year at a time with the new proficiency level 5 being introduced for the 2012/2013 training year. Cadets already undergoing training in the current system will complete their training under the outgoing system.

This program is soon to be updated by the Cadet Program Rescope.

=== Squadron training levels ===
Air cadets are challenged to qualify to five training levels. Each level is normally completed in the ten-month training period from September to June. With the approval of the commanding officer, cadets 14 years of age and older may complete levels 1 and 2 in a single training year. Success in meeting the required standard is rewarded with the appropriate level qualification badge. As cadets advance in the program, lessons are designed to prepare them to take on responsibilities within the squadron, such as teaching other cadets. The chart below displays the training level structure of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. As of the 2022-2023 training year, PHASE (Promoting Healthy And Safe Experiences) training has replaced PSRY (Positive Social Relations with Youth) training. In 2024, level 5 and beyond are replaced with the ALP, &quot;Advanced Leadership Program&quot;, to improve the leadership training of senior cadets.


=== Complementary training groups ===
Squadrons, depending on a number of factors, may have some of the following teams/groups to complement mandatory training. This is not an exhaustive list.
* Drill team: The vast majority of squadrons have some sort of drill team. On drill team, cadets will refine their drill learned during mandatory parade nights and learn more complex drill manoeuvres. Cadets on drill team may have the opportunity to join a drill team at arms, join a flag party, or compete in regional competitions. Cadets interested in drill may elect to take the Drill and Ceremonial Instructor summer training course.
* Marksmanship team: Some squadrons may have a marksmanship team. Cadets on marksmanship team learn to fire lead pellets at paper targets using the Daisy Air Rifle, which is not legally classified as a firearm. Cadets may compete in regional or national marksmanship competitions. Cadets interested in marksmanship may elect to take the Air Rifle Marksmanship Instructor summer training course.
* Military band: Some squadrons may elect to offer musical training. Cadets in military band have the opportunity to learn a brass, woodwind, or percussion instrument. Cadets will learn their instrument as well as various specialized drill manoeuvres. Military bands in cadets are led by adult staff and a cadet Drum Major. Cadets may have the opportunity to compete in musical competitions at various levels. Cadets interested in music may elect to take the Military Band Musician summer training course.
* Pipe band: Some squadrons may offer pipes and drums training. Cadets in a pipe band have the opportunity to learn the bagpipes, snare drum, tenor drum, or bass drum. Cadets will learn their instrument as well as various specialized drill manoeuvres. Pipe bands in the cadets are led by adult staff, a cadet Pipe Major, and a cadet Drum Major. Pipe Band Musician was not offered as summer training course in 2022.
* Biathlon team: Some squadrons may have a biathlon team. Cadets will learn how to run or ski cross-country and learn how to shoot a target. Cadets may have the opportunity to compete in regional or national competitions.
* Ground school: Some squadrons may have a ground school group, where cadets learn the fundamentals of aviation (per Transport Canada guidelines). Less squadrons have offered this in recent years due to the introduction of the national online ground school, which is the only recognized ground school program for applications for the cadet PPTC and GPTC.

== Summer training ==

Air cadets have the opportunity to participate in training outside of their squadron during the summer. Cadets can participate in summer training courses at a Cadet Training Centre (CTC) or national summer training courses.

=== Cadet Activity Program (CAP) ===
The Cadet Activity Program (CAP) was a community-based day camp created in 2022 to replace summer training courses for junior cadets. Cadets in their first year of cadets participated in a 5-day CAP, which consisted a variety of miscellaneous cadet-oriented activities. Cadets in their second year of cadets participated in a 12-day CAP with a focus on team-building and leadership skills. Citing challenges to resources that came with a day-camp model, the Cadet Activity Program was discontinued in 2024.

=== Summer training courses ===
Summer training courses are overnight summer camps that take place at Cadet Training Centres (CTCs), lasting two, four, or six-to-seven weeks. Cadets receive instruction in a specific area of cadet training, such as drill, music, or marksmanship. Instruction is delivered by officers of the CIC, civilian adult staff, and staff cadets. Upon successful completion of a course, cadets are issued a badge to be worn on their tunic.

=== National courses ===
==== International Air Cadet Exchange (IACE) ====
The &quot;International Air Cadet Exchange&quot; is a three-week exchange that allow cadets to visit air bases, industry centres, world landmarks, universities, cultural centres and museums, and experience private hospitality with families in their homes. It is intended for outstanding senior cadets who will represent Canada with distinction. Outside of Canada, destinations include Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

==== Pilot training courses ====
The air cadet program offers two pilot training courses; one for glider pilots and one for private pilots. These courses are six-to-seven weeks in duration that give cadets the opportunity to each a Transport Canada pilot licence without charge to the cadet. The Glider Pilot Training Course (GPTC) is operated by the cadet program at two Cadet Flying Training Centres (CFTC), Mountain View and St-Jean. The Power Pilot Training Course (PPTC) is done at contracted private flying schools. The selection process includes a 40-hour self-guided ground school course (culminating with a 50-question exam), a review of a cadet&#x27;s file, and an interview. These course satisfy all components of the Transport Canada requirements for pilot training. Cadets who have been successful within the program have gone on to work with commercial airlines, the Canadian Forces, various courier and charter companies, and have also gone on to become instructors at various flight schools. The opportunity to obtain a private pilots&#x27; licence is one of the most prestigious and attractive opportunities available to air cadets.

Cadets are presented with fabric and metal pilot wings to display on their Distinctive Elemental Uniform upon successful completion of a pilot training course.

=== Cadet Training Centres (CTCs) ===
The Cadet Training Centres (CTC) of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets are distributed across Canada, often co-located with a Canadian Forces base. The following are CTCs used for air cadets as of 2024. In 2021–2022, as part of the Cadet Program Rescope, the total number of CTCs were reduced to 12. CTCs closed were either handed over to civilian firms, returned to their military establishments, or used for other aspects of summer training such as CAP.


==Notes==
:1.As of 2024, no courses for Air Cadets are given at Bagotville CTC, being exclusively a Sea Cadet training centre. However, Air Cadets can work as a staff there. Bagotville CTC also accommodates PPTC (Power Pilot Training Course) cadets, part of St-Jean CTC, during their training at &quot;Exact Air&quot;, a flying school nearby.

=== Summer training courses ===
The following is a list of all summer training courses as of March 2024. Courses at the introductory level (Level 2) consist of two weeks of in-person training, and courses at the instructor/advanced level (Level 3+) last four weeks, with the exception of the pilot training courses. Cadets in Level 1 do not participate in summer training activities.

== Flying ==
Throughout the spring and fall approximately 22,000 air cadets participate in familiarization gliding at regional gliding centres located across the country. Each summer, 320 cadets earn a Transport Canada Glider Pilot Licence through the Air Cadet Glider Pilot Training Course and 250 more earn a Private Pilot licence. The Air Cadet Gliding Program conducts approximately 60,000 glider flights annually in Schweizer SGS 2-33 gliders. The aircraft fleet used in the gliding program is owned by the Air Cadet League of Canada. The fleet, consisting of more than 100 gliders and tow planes is maintained by the Canadian Forces under a memorandum of understanding. Canadian Forces pilots and Civilian Instructors operate the fleet to train cadets. The aircraft that are used during the Private Pilot Training Course are various, and they depend on the flight school the cadet is posted at during their course. The Private Pilot Training Course is operated by private flight schools, and the instructors are not affiliated with the cadet program. The aircraft can be a Cessna 152, Cessna 150, Cessna 172, or DA20 Katana.

== Uniform ==
All air cadets are issued uniform items for ceremonial and routine training occurrences. Uniforms are provided at no cost to the cadet. Cadets are responsible for care, cleaning and custody of the issued kit and must return it once they are no longer a cadet.

=== Distinctive Elemental Uniform (DEU) ===
Also referred to as the C1, it is used on ceremonial and formal occasions. Currently Air Cadets in level 3 and above are issued a blue wedge, blue jacket (tunic) with a belt, short-sleeved sky blue collared shirt, black necktie, blue trousers, black web belt with a silver-brass buckle, grey wool socks, and polishable black leather boots. Cadets are also issued a plastic name tag with their surname on it, slip-on ranks, and stand-alone rank insignia which are sewn onto the tunic.

There are a number of authorized accoutrements with the DEU, including white cotton gloves, a white lanyard, and a white nylon belt. These are issued to those cadets in notable positions during parade nights (called &quot;parade positions&quot;). The white lanyard is worn around the left shoulder, and the white nylon belt is worn in place of the standard-issue fabric tunic belt. The white nylon belt comes with a gold-brass buckle stamped with the insignia of the Canadian Armed Forces. Cadets who have been given medals or other awards through the cadet program wear these decorations with the DEU.

Cadets with religious beliefs that require modifications to the uniform, such as those of the Sikh faith, may wear a turban in place of the standard-issue wedge cap.

==== Highland Dress ====
Highland dress is a special order of dress reserved exclusively for those cadets who are pipe band musicians at their squadron. Pipe band musicians are issued a Glengarry headdress, a kilt woven with the air cadet tartan, two sporrans (one hair, one leather), hosetops, and white spats. Various accoutrements to the highland dress include a drum major&#x27;s sash, a leopard skin worn on the front of the uniform like an apron, and a sgian-dubh. Only bass and tenor drummers are authorized to wear the leopard skin, and only Pipe Majors are authorized to carry the sgian-dubh.

=== Field Training Uniform (FTU) ===
For their day-to-day training dress (Field Training Uniform (FTU)), cadets are issued an air force blue beret or side cap depending on squadron with the badge of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets sewn on it, blue elemental t-shirt, olive green tunic, olive green pants, and black multi-purpose boots. The black web belt from the DEU is worn with the FTU pants. Cadets may also be issued an olive green name tape with their last name in dark blue lettering, similar in style to those of the Canadian Armed Forces, which is sewn on the FTU tunic.

=== Cold weather uniform items ===
Cadets will be issued a number of uniform items to be worn in instances of cold weather, including an all-season coat, black winter gloves, and a blue toque. Cadets may wear these items &quot;when weather conditions dictate&quot;. The all-season coat comes with a liner and an exterior coat.

=== Numbered orders of dress ===
All cadet uniform items are worn in accordance with the numbered orders of dress. All orders of dress may be worn with cold weather uniform items.
== Ranks ==

Upon enrolment, a new cadet in the Air Cadet Program is known as an &quot;Air Cadet&quot; (AC). Promotion to higher ranks occurs after the cadet has met certain nationally prescribed standards. The specific criteria for all ranks are established to ensure that all cadets who receive a rank promotion possess the same basic qualifications or similar experience, the successful completion of squadron training serves as the common standard on which all cadets are evaluated, and that every cadet is given the same opportunity to advance.

Cadets start receiving responsibilities within their flights upon reaching the rank of Flight Corporal. Flight Corporals may act as section commanders within their flights, giving guidance to sections of junior cadets on topics such as uniforms and drill. Sergeants are responsible for the day-to-day activities of the squadron, with their responsibilities including instructing EOs, performing various administrative tasks (i.e.: attendance), and assisting flight NCOs as seconds-in-command. Flight Sergeants command flights and have responsibilities similar to those of Sergeants. Warrant Officers 2nd Class work closely with adult leadership to ensure smooth operations and the completion of all necessary tasks. They usually assist officers in support roles in administration, training, supply, and public relations. Warrant Officers 1st Class report directly to the Commanding Officer of their squadron and oversee all squadron activities.

The official name of each rank uses the word &quot;cadet&quot; as a preface (e.g.: &quot;cadet&quot; corporal). However, custom omits &quot;cadet&quot; in casual reference, thus, &quot;corporal&quot; is the usual wording. Where there is a need to distinguish between cadets and Canadian Forces members, ranks will be written or spoken as &quot;cadet corporal&quot; and abbreviated as C/Cpl.

=== Merit Review Board (MRB) process ===
All promotions to the rank of Warrant Officer Second Class (WO2) and Warrant Officer First Class (WO1) require the cadet to be recommended by a Merit Review Board (MRB). The MRB is composed of a minimum of three to a maximum of five members. As appointed by the squadron commanding officer, members include the Commanding officer (or delegate) acting as the board&#x27;s chairperson, a representative of the Air Cadet League or local sponsor, and 1-3 additional members.

The MRB has two parts: a review of the cadet&#x27;s file and an interview. Criteria for the file review are the same for all candidates and are set by the board chairperson, but generally includes rates of attendance, a review of the cadet&#x27;s performance in squadron training, a review of summer training course reports or performance evaluations, relevant positive or disciplinary notes on file, and a list of awards the cadet has received at the squadron and national level. Once the file review is completed, cadets will be invited to complete the interview. All participating cadets will be asked the same questions, which are sent to them up to 72 hours in advance of the interview. Cadets may be asked questions about their participation and goals in the program, their leadership experiences, and how they would respond to various scenarios. Once both portions of the MRB process have been completed, the board will decide whether the cadet merits promotion to the next rank.

As of October 10, 2023, there is no longer a requirement for cadets to participate in the Cadet Fitness Assessment to be promoted. In addition, promotions to ranks below Warrant Officer Second Class no longer require a minimum standard of completion in the level-appropriate leadership performance objective.

== Music appointments ==

When a squadron wishes to create a cadet band, the decision to do so must be made in consultation with the sponsoring committee responsible for provision and maintenance of musical instruments. The cadet music program recognizes two types of bands: military bands and pipe bands. Military bands&#x27; instrumentation includes woodwinds, brass, and/or percussion, while pipe bands&#x27; instrumentation includes pipes and drums. The Regional Support Cadet Unit should provide instruments on loan to their squadrons to maximize the use of the instruments held by the region and CSTCs and to better support squadron training. The music proficiency levels are recognized on the cadet uniform using a system of badges based on the music training programs; the military band badge represents a lyre, while the pipe band badge represents either a pipe or a drum, depending on the instrument played.

The appointment of a Drum Major or Pipe Major is at the discretion of the corps/squadron CO. Requirements considered include: demonstration of skills and knowledge in band drill, commands and formations, qualification of Music Proficiency Level 2, and holds the minimum rank of Flight Corporal. Only one cadet may be appointed as the squadron Drum Major or Pipe Major at any time.

== Honours and awards ==
The Canadian Cadet Movement maintains its own Honours and Awards system. Cadets may be awarded these based on criteria including bravery, citizenship, service, outstanding performance on a summer training course, and more. In addition, cadets may also wear, on their uniform, any orders, decorations, and medals of Canada they have been awarded.

Within the system, there are several honours and awards common to all three cadet elements and some that are unique to each. A cadet who transfers from one element to another may continue to wear any medals awarded from their previous service, but in general, air cadets may be eligible for the following nine honours and awards (shown in the order of precedence):

== Symbols ==

=== Flags ===

In some squadrons, the ensign and squadron banner are carried by a flag party with the Flag of Canada (see image in the Local training section above), despite CF custom being for one- or two-flag parties only. Subject to regional regulations, flag party escorts may carry deactivated drill purpose rifles.
The Royal Canadian Air Cadets Banner is flown only on important ceremonial occasions to indicate the presence of a formed body of cadets, and, at the end of useful life, is deposited, after the manner of colours, in some suitable location. The banner was presented in 1991 at the Senior Leaders Course at CFB Cold Lake, and was paraded at the Senior Leaders Course graduation parades each summer until the course was replaced with the Leadership and Ceremonial Instructor Course. Though not consecrated, the flag parallels Air Force Command Colours and is carried in the same manner. Cadets pay compliments to the banner in a similar manner to a consecrated colour. Members of the CF are not required to pay compliments to the banner but may do so as a courtesy. This banner was carried on parade at subsequent graduation parades until the discontinuing of the Senior Leaders Course in 2010. The Banner was then carried annually at CFB Trenton in a &quot;Trooping the Banner&quot; event held every year until its cessation in 2022.

Originally approved in 1941, the Royal Canadian Air Cadets Ensign was modified in 1971 to incorporate the National Flag in the canton. The flag parallels a Canadian Forces command flag (as distinct from a Command Colour). The ensign is normally flown at the squadron and often carried as part of a flag party. It is always flown from a mast or pole at air cadet summer training centres.

The squadron banner parallels an Air Force Squadron Standard and is carried by squadrons as their specific unit identifier. Unlike a squadron standard, however, an air cadet squadron banner may not be consecrated nor can they emblazoned with battle honours. Though squadron banners may not be consecrated, they may be dedicated and may be laid up in a manner paralleling similar ceremonies for squadron standards. Compliments are paid to the squadron banner in the same manner as the Air Cadet Banner.
The squadron&#x27;s name and number are embroidered on the banner. The Air Cadet League did for a brief period allow the acquisition of squadron banners featuring the individual squadron&#x27;s badge in place of standard design. It is unclear, should any of these banners require replacement, if anything other than the standard design will be authorized.

=== Badge ===

The badge of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets consists of a circlet surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves, superimposed with a flying falcon, the head to the sinister (left). The whole is crowned by the Royal crown — fashioned as a St Edward&#x27;s Crown — to symbolize the monarchy of Canada as the Cadets&#x27; source of authority. This all rests on a scroll displaying the words &quot;Royal Canadian Air Cadets/Cadets de l&#x27;aviation royale du Canada&quot;.

This badge is worn as an embroidered badge on the left side of the wedge cap and other formal headdress, and as an embroidered patch on the all-weather jacket. The badge is also embroidered on the air cadet beret. The original hat badge featured an eagle surmounted by a single maple leaf, with two underlying scrolls reading &quot;Air Cadets Canada&quot;.
== Cadet Fitness Assessment and Incentive Program ==

The Cadet Fitness Assessment and Incentive Program replaced the old fitness testing program in the 2010-2011 training year. It is based on the FITNESSGRAM testing protocol produced by the Cooper Institute. The standards are currently being redeveloped to better align with policies on gender inclusion.

=== Fitness assessment ===

=== Incentive program ===
As of June 28, 2023, the incentive program has been paused for at least one calendar year to allow for redevelopment.

There are four incentive levels cadets can achieve based on their results in the fitness assessment: bronze, silver, gold, and excellence. How cadets score each event is based on their age and gender.

Once all events have been scored, after discarding their lowest score, cadets receive an overall incentive level in line with their lowest score. The results from the 20m shuttle run are never discarded. Cadets receive a badge worn on their DEU tunic that corresponds with their overall incentive level.

<text>Flecktarn (; &quot;mottled camouflage&quot;; also known as Flecktarnmuster or Fleckentarn) is a family of three-, four-, five- or six-color disruptive camouflage patterns, the most common being the five-color pattern, consisting of dark green, grey-green, red brown, and black over a light green or tan base depending on the manufacturer. The original German five-color pattern was designed for use in European temperate woodland terrain. A three-color variation called Tropentarn (formerly Wüstentarn) is intended for arid and desert conditions; the German Bundeswehr wore it in Afghanistan.

The original German five-color flecktarn has been adopted, copied and modified by many countries for their own camouflage patterns.

== History ==
The German Army started experimenting with camouflage patterns before World War II, and some army units used &quot;Splittermuster&quot; (&quot;splinter pattern&quot;) camouflage, first issued in 1931. Waffen-SS combat units used various patterns from 1935 onwards. Many SS camouflage patterns were designed by Johann Georg Otto Schick.

== Modern patterns ==
In 1976, the in Germany developed a number of prototype camouflage patterns, to be trialled as replacements for the solid olive-grey &quot;moleskin&quot; combat uniform. At least four distinct camouflage patterns were tested during &quot;Bundeswehr Truppenversuch 76&quot; (&quot;Bundeswehr Troop Trial 76&quot;.) These were based on patterns in nature: one was called &quot;Dots&quot; or &quot;Points&quot;; another was called &quot;Ragged Leaf&quot; or &quot;Saw Tooth Edge&quot;; another was based on pine needles in winter.

Designed by the German company Marquardt &amp; Schulz, several patterns were developed and tested by the German military. The pattern named &quot;Flecktarn B&quot; was chosen as the final pattern for use. The word flecktarn is a composite formed from the German words &quot;Fleck&quot; (spot, blot(ch), mark or mottle) and &quot;Tarnung&quot; (camouflage.) The Bundeswehr kept its green combat dress throughout the 1980s, however, while trials were conducted. &quot;Flecktarn&quot; was only widely introduced in 1990 in a newly reunited Germany.

In 1985 the Dutch government tested Flecktarn B with soldiers of its 13th Armored Brigade in Oirschot. Locally named &quot;Stippel&quot;, the pattern met with media opposition for its perceived similarity to Waffen-SS &quot;peas&quot; and &quot;oak leaves&quot; camouflage. Among other criticisms, there were complaints from some users about double vision when looking at the “dot pattern” for a long time. The Dutch government scrapped the plan completely in 1987.

In Germany, the &quot;Flecktarn&quot; camouflage pattern is used by all &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; service branches, the &quot;Heer&quot; (army), the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (air force), some &quot;Marine&quot; (navy) units and even the &quot;Sanitätsdienst&quot; (medical service.) Its official name is &quot;5 Farben-Tarndruck der Bundeswehr&quot; (five-color camouflage print of the Bundeswehr.) This temperate &quot;Flecktarn&quot; five-color scheme consists of 15% light green, 20% light olive, 35% dark green, 20% brown and 10% black.

=== Evolution ===
Manufacturing contractors for the Bundeswehr are bound by the requirements and specifications laid out by the &quot;Bundesamt für Ausrüstung, Informationstechnik und Nutzung der Bundeswehr&quot; - BAAINBw (Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support of the German Armed Forces.) The specific document that contractors must comply with is the &quot;Technische Lieferbedingungen&quot; - TL (Technical Delivery Conditions.)

Within the TL are material performance sheets for all products conforming to civilian, ISO, and military specifications, as applicable. The TL requirements for &quot;flecktarn&quot; have undergone changes over the years and the pattern is now in its fifth iteration. The most observable changes have been to the colors, most notably from about 2005 whereupon the color screens became more separated making the pattern overall brighter. Visually the green and grey screens of post-2005 &quot;flecktarn&quot; are lighter with greater separation and the brown screen has become more of a rust-like color, whereas the former green and grey screens were darker and closer in hue and the brown screen was more of a reddish-brown. In the modern colors the black screen now presents in sharp contrast to the rest of the colors.

===Multitarn replacement===
In 2016, tests were conducted by the Research Institute of materials and property of the Bundeswehr (&quot;Wehrwissenschaftliche Institut für Werk- und Betriebsstoffe&quot; – WIWeB) on a new pattern designated &quot;Multitarn&quot; as a potential replacement for &quot;flecktarn&quot;.

The pattern is intended as a multi-terrain pattern, initially for use only by German special forces. The Bundeswehr initially expressed plans for adoption by multiple divisions of the Bundeswehr to complement existing flecktarn patterns but as of 2022 this had not occurred. Unlike with its previous flecktarn patterns the Bundeswehr has taken strict measures over its property rights and distribution control to prevent unauthorized and illegal production of the pattern outside the Bundeswehr&#x27;s authorized contractors.

==Variants==
=== Belgium ===
Bundeswehr &quot;flecktarn&quot; was used by airbase security and anti-aircraft units of the Belgian Air Force from 1988 to 2000. The pattern was unchanged from the original but slightly larger than the eventual Bundeswehr production pattern. It is noteworthy here that the model developed in Germany was put into general use by the Belgian Air Force almost three years before it was introduced into the Bundeswehr. A modular kit and a two-piece rucksack in &quot;flecktarn&quot; pattern was used to complete the uniform of field trousers, blouse and parka.

=== Denmark ===
=== Russia ===
The Russian military uses a wide range of different commercial camouflage patterns including several variations of flecktarn. One is called &quot;Sever&quot; (&quot;north&quot;.) This pattern is a three-color pattern which is almost identical to Danish M84 but the base screen is tan. The pattern was introduced in Russia in 2006.

Another variant is called &quot;Tochka-4&quot; (Point-4) produced by the Russian company Modoks. The pattern is essentially Flectarn-D with a fourth color, brown, added.

Another pattern resembling Bundeswehr five-color &quot;flecktarn&quot; has been used by some Russian forces with the difference being that the brown screen is red.

=== Japan ===

Japan adopted a &quot;flecktarn&quot;-based pattern called Type II Camouflage, or &quot;Jietai&quot; which has been in use with the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force since 1985. This pattern is a four-color version consisting of light green, brown and black on a beige background. A desert version is also in use.

=== China ===
&quot;Type 03 Plateau&quot; camouflage is a five-color flecktarn pattern that was formerly used in the early 2000s by the Chinese military in Tibet. It consists of a base color of sand with grey, light-brown, mid-brown, and black. Although the artwork is identical to the German original the Chinese version is only a portion of the complete pattern. Among collectors it is alternatively called &quot;Tibetarn&quot; or &quot;Tibet flecktarn&quot;. The pattern was replaced by a four-color digitalized version called &quot;07 Arid Camouflage&quot; (&quot;07式荒漠迷彩作训服&quot;) in 2007.

Some Russian special forces have also used this same pattern. The Russian version is made locally for military contractors by SPLAV.

=== Poland ===
The &quot;Samodzielny Pododdzial Antyterrorystyczny Policji&quot; - SPAP (anti-terrorism unit of the Polish National Police) have used a five-color flecktarn variant called &quot;WZ AT 1 Plamiak&quot;, also known as &quot;Metro&quot; colloquially. The pattern is different in that it repeats itself regularly in the print at relatively short intervals. A woodland version referred to as &quot;Gepard&quot; has been used by the &quot;Agencja Bezpieczenstwa Wewnetrznego&quot; - ABW (Polish Internal Security Agency.) A five-color desert version was also developed.

A flecktarn camo made by Kama is in use by the Implementation Department, Metropolitan Police Command, Warsaw Police.

=== Indonesia ===
In June 2022, Indonesia&#x27;s &quot;Detasemen Khusus 88 Antiteror&quot; - DENSUS 88 AT (Police Counter-Terrorism Force) were seen wearing a flecktarn-influenced six-color camouflage uniform consisting of a tan base with three shades of green along with chocolate brown and near-black. The unit&#x27;s Owl&#x27;s Head logo is discretely incorporated in the pattern.

=== Bulgaria ===

A semi-digitized version of the original German five-color pattern in post-2005 colors, designated &quot;M-18&quot;, was adopted by the Bulgarian army in 2018 however the same pattern was first used by some Russian special forces Airborne troops in the early 2010s.

=== Yemen ===
The Special Security Forces of Yemen adopted a five-color digitalized pattern which could be said to resemble &quot;flecktarn&quot; but with darker colours similar to the pre-2005 colorway.

=== Netherlands ===
=== Commercial variants ===
* In 2013, the German company Mil-Tec introduced a new version of &quot;Flecktarn&quot;, called the &quot;Arid Flecktarn&quot;. It retains the original five-color pattern but with the color scheme resembling that of MultiCam. It remains a commercial variant and is not in use by any world military.
* &quot;German Woodland&quot; is a commercially available copy of five-color flecktarn produced in China. The pattern is only a portion of the original Bundeswehr pattern and the green and brown screens have been inverted. On Alibaba and Aliexpress sites it is sometimes listed as &quot;flecktarn&quot;. This Chinese copy has been used by some sections of the Armed Forces of the Kyrgyz Republic as noted during the Osh ethnic clashes of 2010.

<text>Guillermo David Endara Galimany (May 12, 1936 – September 28, 2009) was a Panamanian politician who served as the president of Panama from 1989 to 1994.

Raised in a family allied to Panameñista Party founder Arnulfo Arias, Endara attended school in exile in the United States and Argentina following Arias&#x27;s removal from power in 1941. Endara later received a law degree in Panama and subsequently served as a member of Panama&#x27;s National Assembly, and briefly as a government minister before heading into exile again following Arias&#x27; third overthrow in 1968.

After Arias&#x27; death in 1988, Endara became a leading opponent of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama. Endara was sworn in as the new president on the first night of the invasion on a U.S. military base.

During his presidency, Endara abolished the Panamanian military and replaced it with a national police force. Endara&#x27;s term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions, but also high unemployment rates. His administration was marked by internal fighting, and his popularity plummeted. He was succeeded by opposition candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares in 1994.

Endara ran for office again in 2004 and 2009, but lost to Democratic Revolutionary Party candidate Martín Torrijos and to independent candidate Ricardo Martinelli. He died of a heart attack in September 2009, several months after his last campaign.

==Early life and career==
Endara was born in 1936 in Panama City, Panama. His father, Guillermo Endara Paniza, was an ally of Authentic Panameñista Party founder Arnulfo Arias, and the family went into exile after Arias was overthrown in a 1941 coup. Endara went to school in Argentina and to Black-Foxe Military Institute in Los Angeles in the United States, where he was described as being a &quot;brilliant student&quot;. He later attended the University of Panama Law School, where he graduated first in his class, and New York University.

He returned to Panama in 1963 to practice law, and specialized in labor law. He co-founded the firm of Solis, Endara, Delgado and Guevara, one of Panama&#x27;s most successful law firms. He won his first public office in 1964 but declined to take it due to evidence of voter fraud in the election.

Endara later served two terms in the National Assembly. In 1968, Endara served as minister of planning and economic policy during Arias&#x27;s very brief third term as president. When Arias was overthrown again in October 1968, Endara went underground, was jailed briefly in 1971, and joined Arias in exile until 1977. Endara remained politically engaged and when Arias died in 1988, Endara became a leading opposition figure.

==Opposition to Noriega==
In the presidential election of 1989, Endara ran as the candidate of the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition (ADOC), a coalition of parties opposed to military ruler Manuel Noriega. His rival was Carlos Duque, a candidate selected by Noriega. The US government contributed $10 million to Panamanian opposition campaigns, though it was unknown whether Endara received any of this money.

To safeguard against planned vote-rigging by Noriega, ADOC organized a count of results from the country&#x27;s election precincts before they were sent to the district centers. It showed Endara trouncing Duque by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. Noriega&#x27;s cronies took phony tally sheets to the district centers, but by this time the opposition&#x27;s count was already out. International observers led by former US President Jimmy Carter and a separate group of observers appointed by US President George H. W. Bush also agreed that Endara had won a decisive victory. Noriega had planned to declare Duque the winner regardless of the actual results, but Duque knew he&#x27;d been routed and refused to go along. Regardless, Noriega annulled the results before counting was complete due to &quot;foreign interference.&quot;

The next day, Endara and his running mates, Ricardo Arias Calderón and Guillermo Ford, led a contingent of a thousand supporters to protest the annulment of the elections and urge that the ADOC candidates be recognized as the winners. The protest was attacked by a detachment of Dignity Battalions, a paramilitary group supporting Noriega, and the three candidates were badly beaten. Endara was struck with an iron club, leaving a gash on his head. He was briefly hospitalized and received eight stitches. Images of the attacks on Endara and Ford were carried by media around the world, and were credited with building public support in the US for the invasion that would soon follow.

== Presidency (1989–1994) ==
The US armed forces overthrew Noriega&#x27;s government during the US invasion of Panama in December 1989. Endara had by this time taken refuge in the military bases under US control. American officials told Endara that if he did not accept the presidency, the only alternative would be an undisguised American occupation. Though Endara had opposed US military action during his campaign, he accepted the presidency, stating later that, &quot;morally, patriotically, civically I had no other choice&quot;. He was certified the winner of the election and inaugurated at Fort Clayton, a United States military base, on December 20, 1989. Arias was inaugurated as first vice president, and Ford as second vice president. Unlike previous rulers Omar Torrijos and Noriega, Endara appointed only whites to ministerial positions, excluding Panama&#x27;s large mestizo population and other ethnicities.

Seen as a restorer of democracy, Endara was later noted for having defended freedom of speech and democratic institutions. He also oversaw a reform of the Panamanian Defense Forces, purging Noriega loyalists, asserting the primacy of the civilian government, and returning the group from military to a national police force. In October 1994, the National Assembly passed an amendment abolishing the military at Endara&#x27;s urging, becoming the second Latin American country to do so.

In early 1991, the ADOC coalition began to unravel as Endara, Arias, and Ford publicly criticized one another. On April 8, accusing Arias&#x27;s Christian Democratic Party of not rallying to his support during an impeachment vote, Endara dismissed Arias from the cabinet. Arias resigned from the vice presidency on December 17, 1992, stating at a news conference that Endara&#x27;s government &quot;does not listen to the people, nor does it have the courage to make changes&quot;. Endara responded that Arias&#x27;s resignation was &quot;demagoguery&quot; and &quot;merely starting his 1994 political campaign ahead of time&quot;.

Endara&#x27;s term in office saw marked economic recovery from the nation&#x27;s years of military rule. During his presidency, Panama had an average annual economic growth of 8%. However, unemployment also rose near 19%. In February 1990, the overweight Endara began a hunger strike in the Metropolitan Cathedral to call attention to the nation&#x27;s poverty and to pressure US President George H. W. Bush to dispense previously pledged American aid. In the course of the strike, he lost more than of his .

By May 1992, Endara&#x27;s public approval rating had fallen from its initial 70% to only 10%. The Associated Press later described Endara&#x27;s administration as being &quot;tarnished by scandal&quot;. Among other financial scandals, Endara&#x27;s wife Ana Mae Diaz was accused of reselling food that had been donated by Italy on the streets of Panama City. In 1992, Diaz won $125,000 in the national lottery and indicated that she intended to keep the money rather than donating it; the incident was also cited as an example of the Endara&#x27;s administration&#x27;s lack of concern for Panama&#x27;s poor.

==Later career==
In 2004, Endara broke with the Arnulfista party over differences of opinion with the party&#x27;s leader, Panamanian president Mireya Moscoso, and accused the party of corruption. He ran in the 2004 presidential election as the candidate of the Solidarity Party, on a platform of reducing crime and government corruption. His primary rival was Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Martín Torrijos, son of the former military dictator Omar Torrijos. Martín Torrijos ran on a platform of strengthening democracy and negotiating a free trade agreement with the US, and was supported by popular musician and politician Ruben Blades. Endara finished second, receiving 31% of the vote to Torrijos&#x27; 47%.

He later founded his own political party, the Moral Vanguard of the Fatherland, and in 2009 was again a candidate for the Panamanian general elections. Ricardo Martinelli of the Democratic Change party won the election with 61% of the vote, while PRD candidate Balbina Herrera won 37%. Endara placed a distant third, with 2% of the vote.

Just a few months later, on September 28, 2009, Endara died at the age of 73 in his apartment in Panama City, of a heart attack while preparing dinner. He was given a state funeral on September 30 attended by President Martinelli as well as former presidents Perez Balladares, Moscoso, and Torrijos.

==Personal life==
Endara married his first wife Marcela, in 1961; the couple had one daughter, Marcelita, and three grandchildren, Javier, Marcela Victoria and Jacob. Marcela died of a heart attack in 1989 while Endara was hospitalized from the attack by the Dignity Brigades. He remarried on June 11, 1990, at the age of 54, to Ana Mae Diaz Chen, a 22-year-old law student of Chinese origin. Endara was reportedly so happy in the marriage that he would even leave cabinet meetings for &quot;a quick cuddle&quot;. The marriage received widespread coverage and mockery in the Panamanian press, including a new nickname for Endara, &quot;El Gordo Feliz&quot; (&quot;Happy Fatty&quot;).

<doc id="628054" wikidata="Q2411887" url="?curid=628054" title="Katimavik">
<text>Katimavik ( &quot;meeting place&quot;) is a registered charity that engages Canadian youth through volunteer work. Katimavik provides opportunities for young Canadians to participate in five to six-month periods of community service throughout the country via the National Experience program. It was founded in 1977 by the late Senator Jacques Hébert and the Honourable Barney Danson, a former Minister of National Defence.

Currently, Katimavik is led by John-Frederick Cameron, an experienced executive in the Canadian non-profit sector.

==Overview==
The Katimavik National Experience consists of groups of 11 youths, aged 17 to 25, who come from across Canada. They travel together to two different places in Canada for a period of five to six months. During the 2018-19 program year, Katimavik had 198 participants spread across six communities: Nanaimo, BC; Calgary, AB; Winnipeg, MB; Sudbury, ON; Quebec City, QC; and Moncton, NB. Each youth volunteers for at least 30 hours per week and completes a learning program that focuses on Truth and Reconciliation, Canada&#x27;s official languages, eco-stewardship, leadership, cultural diversity, and healthy living. Each year, over 500 community non-profit organizations are assisted by Katimavik Participants doing full-time work for them. Katimavik has had volunteer projects in all 10 Canadian provinces and three territories. Katimavik has signed partnerships with a number of post-secondary institutions in Canada, including Vancouver Island University, Capilano University, Quebec&#x27;s public community colleges (CEGEP), Trent University, and George Brown College in order for Katimavik participants to receive post-secondary credit for their experiences.

Katimavik currently has its national headquarters in Westmount, Quebec.

==History==
Katimavik was started by Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s federal administration under the responsibility of then-Senator Jacques Hébert as well as then-Minister of National Defence Barney Danson. Legally, it was incorporated as OPCAN, a non-profit corporation created by letters patent dated January 26, 1977, pursuant to Part II of the &quot;Canada Business Corporations Act&quot;. Much of Katimavik&#x27;s structure was taken from Canadian Cadet Organizations and the defunct Company of Young Canadians.
In 1977 had a full military option for one year different than the civilian option at the time .
In the 1980s Katimavik offered a military option, an opportunity to spend three months on an Army or Navy base learning fundamental skills such as first aid and map reading, as well as basic military skills, such as drills and rifle handling.

The overall program grew quickly in its initial years to its peak in 1985–86, when it engaged over 5,000 participants. The program was cancelled that year by Brian Mulroney&#x27;s new government.

The cancellation prompted founder Jacques Hébert to undertake on a 21-day hunger strike in protest, to no avail. He subsequently worked with Quebec region director Claude Raiche to continue Katimavik as an outdoor recreation training centre at Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Île-Perrot.

It continued in this form until 1994 when Youth Service Canada helped Katimavik to form a pilot program involving six projects and 66 participants. The next year, the Government of Canada&#x27;s Department of Heritage provided the program with ongoing funding and the number of projects and youth tripled. The program then continued to grow; during the 2005-2006 program year there were 1,155 participants in 105 communities across Canada. In 2008, Katimavik was granted consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which has allowed Katimavik to liaise with similar organizations in other countries and represent Canada internationally.

In 2006, Katimavik was told by the government that its funding was under review and that it was to cease recruitment activities. A letter-writing campaign was organized by Katimavik and funding levels were maintained until October 2010 when the government announced three-year funding in the sum of $15 million per year, a reduction from its previous funding levels ($19.7 million).

==Current leadership==
Katimavik is currently led by John-Frederick Cameron, an experienced executive in the non-profit and charitable sectors. Cameron was appointed to the position in November 2019. His stated objectives are to increase Katimavik&#x27;s visibility, broaden and improve the National Experience, and diversify the organization&#x27;s programming and funding sources.

==Program life==
Participants volunteer at least 30 hours a week and engage in workshops and activities with their fellow group members and project leader. Three groups in close communities form a &quot;cluster&quot; that may often meet up together for certain activities. Each cluster of four projects is monitored by a project coordinator.

During the program, participants can expect to abide by certain standards of behaviour which fall into four main categories: participation, health and safety, and respect. Participants are monitored by their project leader, who resides in-house and supports the project. Project leaders can issue verbal warnings, commitments to improve, final warnings, and expulsions if the behavioural standards are not followed.

Participants receive four letters of appraisal (2 from the project leaders, and 2 from work supervisors), as well as a certificate of completion upon finishing the program.

While participants are in the program, they will spend a week of their time in each community living with a &quot;host family&quot;. This is a family living in the community that has agreed to take on a participant (or two). This allows the participant to take some time off from group life, while living with members of the community, and learning what it&#x27;s like to be a local.

Each group, every three months, is given budgets of varying amounts for groceries, activities, and transportation. This money is spent in ways that correspond to program&#x27;s learning objectives. The goal of the program&#x27;s educational component is to build the capacities of participants in the following key areas:

* Interact with others in a variety of situations
* Adopt an open attitude towards the diversity of social and multicultural realities
* Communicate in both official languages
* Engage in diverse work experiences
* Apply habits that favour a healthy lifestyle
* Develop an integrated vision of environmental protection and sustainable development
* Engage as a citizen
* Prepare to integrate, as a citizen, into the job market, school or other life event

==Katimavik elimination, protests, and restoration attempts==
In the 2012 Canadian federal budget, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the program would be eliminated due to its comparatively high per-person cost of the program when compared to other government youth initiatives.

==2018 relaunch==
In 2018, Katimavik was relaunched through the newly created Canada Service Corps, a youth service initiative launched by the Government of Canada with the aim of engaging youth in community service across the country.

<text>Ricardo Alberto Martinelli Berrocal (born 11 March 1951) is a Panamanian politician and businessman who served as the 36th President of Panama from 2009 to 2014.

In 2024, Martinelli was sentenced to ten years in prison for embezzlement of public funds and money laundering related to his use of public money to buy several Panamanian media outlets in 2010. He was implicated in several other corruption cases during his presidency (Odebrecht, New Business, Financial Pacific, Blue Apple, among others); he is facing several trials.

== Early life ==
Born in Panama City, Ricardo Martinelli is the son of Ricardo Martinelli Pardini and Gloria Berrocal Fábrega. His father is of Italian descent, and his mother is of Spanish descent. He completed his secondary education at Staunton Military Academy in Staunton, Virginia, in the United States. In 1973 he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration degree from the University of Arkansas where he was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity.

== Business career ==
Martinelli began his career as a credit officer at Citibank in Panama. After several years of banking, he purchased the business of a client, in turn becoming an entrepreneur, buying or starting additional businesses. His net worth was estimated at $1.1 billion or more, according to press reports. &quot;The Economist&quot; stated that voters &quot;want him to run the country as well as he manages his businesses&quot; in response to his victory in the 2009 presidential election.

As of 2009, he was the president and director of the board of Panamanian supermarket chain, Super 99 and of two other companies. From May 2009, he passed the presidency of Super 99 to Luis Enrique Martinelli.

== Politics ==
During the presidency of Ernesto Pérez Balladares, Martinelli served as Director of Social security from 1994 to 1996. From September 1999 to January 2003, during the presidency of Mireya Moscoso, he served as chairman of the board of directors of the Panama Canal and as the Minister for Canal Affairs.

Martinelli was the president of the Democratic Change party, which was founded in May 1998. He led the party and was the presidential candidate during the 2004 general election, when his party came in last; Martinelli received 5.3% of the vote and came in fourth place in the election.

Martinelli was the leader of Democratic Change and presidential candidate in the 2009 general election. He ran on a pro-business platform, promising to cut political corruption and reduce violent crime and spent an estimated $35 million on promoting his campaign. By Election Day, Martinelli was the favorite to win the election, with opinion polls giving him a double-digit lead over the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD)–People&#x27;s Party coalition. He had the support of the Alliance for Change, a group of political parties that includes his own Democratic Change party, the Panameñista Party, the Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement, and the Patriotic Union Party.

His main opponent was PRD candidate Balbina Herrera. Though initially the favorite, she was damaged in the election by her links to former military ruler Manuel Noriega and by the perception that she was a &quot;Chavista&quot;, a supporter of leftist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. Martinelli was also helped by strong support from the business community.

On May 3, 2009, Martinelli won the national election by a landslide, with over 60% of the votes, thanks to the alliance with who would be his vice president, Juan Carlos Varela, who contributed the votes of the Panamanian party, 22.2% of the total, compared to Herrera, who received about 36%. Former president Guillermo Endara finished a distant third. This was the second-largest majority in Panamanian history and the largest since 1989. Martinelli&#x27;s victory was an exception to a trend of victories for left-leaning Latin American candidates. He was sworn in on July 1, 2009.

== Presidency (2009–2014) ==
Martinelli served as president from 2009 through 2014.

Under Martinelli, Panama enjoyed high economic growth. As reported by &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2012, &quot;though it lies in Central America, the poorest and most violent region in the West, the country&#x27;s 3.6m citizens are now richer than most Latin Americans.&quot; The following year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;Panama [was] booming, with an average economic growth of 9 percent in [the past] five years, the highest in Latin America.&quot;

This prosperity widely benefited Panama, with unemployment declining from 6.6% to 4.1%. Income disparity also declined: according to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;the incomes of the poorest 10% are now 35 times lower than those of the richest 10%, rather than 60 times lower, according to the finance ministry.&quot; Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by nearly half, while GDP per capita rose 11%, from $9,982 in 2010 to $11,036 in 2014.

Martinelli introduced a number of measures designed to alleviate poverty, including a $100 monthly pension for the elderly, an increase in the minimum wage, and subsidies for students to meet the cost of uniforms and supplies. He also increased the minimum wage, making it the highest in Latin America.

He also implemented measures to help Colón, an impoverished city on the Gulf Coast. This included projects like a new highway connecting Panama and Colón, the Canal expansion, construction of a new hospital and other public works intended to help reduce unemployment and poverty. The government also announced a $9 million project to rehabilitate Colón&#x27;s seaside park.

In 2012, Panama—along with the U.S.—was one of the few countries that voted against Palestine in a key U.N. vote.

===Infrastructure investment===
As of 2010, Martinelli&#x27;s administration announced plans, ultimately fulfilled during his term, to invest $20 billion over the next four years on infrastructure designed to enhance Panama&#x27;s role as a global logistics hub and increase foreign direct investment. The plan included greater investment in roads, hospitals, sewers, schools, and a Panama City metro. Fitch Group called the &quot;ambitious public investment program&quot; part of &quot;Panama&#x27;s highly favorable investment cycle.&quot; This plan ended up considerably increasing the public debt of the Panamanian state, which reached 45% of GDP.

The cornerstone of Martinelli&#x27;s expansion program was the $5.3 billion expansion of the Panama Canal, which was started by his predecessor.

===Pro-business policies and tax reform===
Once during his first year in office, Martinelli proposed and signed into law tax reforms to simplify filings, reduce rates, and improve collection. The number of income brackets was reduced from five to two, the corporate tax rate was cut to 25%, and delinquent collection was outsourced. The tax reform imposed and collected taxes on a large swath of Panama&#x27;s elite, which had largely avoided significant taxation. The program was not without controversy, however. A spokesperson for Fitch Group defended the tax reform &quot;underpin[ned] the government&#x27;s commitment to sustainable fiscal policies.&quot;

Martinelli oversaw the final approval of the Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement, which was signed more than two years before he took office but had not been finalized. Martinelli had designated the completion of this agreement as his top priority upon taking office. The agreement was ratified by the US Congress on October 13, 2011.

He also oversaw, the approval of a comprehensive Association treaty with other regional countries and the European Union.

Through pro-business policies, Martinelli saw through the growth of Panama as an international transport and financial hub. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Its canal is becoming the backbone of a transoceanic logistics network. Its airline, Copa, connects much of Latin America. Its offshore-banking sector sucks in Latin American money.&quot;

===Rule of Law===
Martinelli also undertook efforts to strengthen the rule of law in Panama and to create greater transparency in its institutions, this had some success. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2011, &quot; American law enforcement officials, while giving the country credit for improving its police forces and cooperation with international agencies, still consider it a major money-laundering haven.&quot; Furthermore, they report that &quot;In the past two years [Panama] has signed agreements with 12 countries, including the United States, to exchange tax and other information upon request, a tool to investigate financial criminals.&quot;

In addition, Martinelli upheld and reinforced drug trafficking laws throughout his presidency. In 2012 alone, the Panamanian government seized over 11 tons of cocaine, as reported by IHS.

===Panama becomes &quot;investment grade&quot;===
During Martinelli&#x27;s term, Panama&#x27;s sovereign debt rating was upgraded to &quot;investment grade&quot; by Fitch, Moody&#x27;s, and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s. Fitch had upgraded Panama twice since Martinelli took office, and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s followed its upgrade with a revised &quot;positive&quot; outlook. The Fitch upgrade was described as &quot;a victory for conservative President Ricardo Martinelli, who has pushed two tax reforms through Congress since taking office&quot;.

Martinelli&#x27;s policies contributed to credit upgrades but also robust increases in foreign direct investment (FDI). During his tenure, FDI rose from $1,259.3 billion (in 2009) to $4,651.3 billion (in 2013).

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, direct investment in real estate was exemplified by &quot;the tallest building in Latin America, a 70-story Trump hotel and condo tower,&quot; further growth in financial services (&quot;banking is booming&quot;) with &quot;well-heeled foreign transplants&quot; spending on local services and goods.

=== Relations with Venezuela ===
===Reputation ===
Martinelli experienced high popularity ratings during his term of office, at one time in excess of 90%, the highest in the Americas at the time. In 2014, when he was preparing to leave office, his approval rating was still high, at 65%.

The Democratic Change Party, has continued to see strong legislative support: with Martinelli as its leader it continues to hold the biggest bloc of 30 seats, versus 12 seats for Panameñista Party in the 71-seat National Assembly. Martinelli remains the leader of Panama&#x27;s opposition party.

Martinelli has also been criticized in the local and international media. In 2011, &quot;The Economist&quot; described the foreign investment as still hurt by &quot;doubts about the rule of law&quot;, citing suspected corruption in the bidding for the metro contract and the flooding of a wealthy Panama City neighborhood with sewage due to a lack of enforcement of planning laws. 
Martinelli was also criticized during his presidency for authoritarian tactics. He sought to reduce the time period before the president could run for re-election though he withdrew when it proved unfeasible. He was accused of tampering with the Supreme Court. In August 2009, the US Ambassador to Panama, Barbara J. Stephenson, wrote to the US State Department that Martinelli had asked her for wiretaps on his political opponents, and she complained of his &quot;bullying style&quot; and &quot;autocratic tendencies&quot;. A copy of the cable was leaked in December 2010. After the leak, Martinelli&#x27;s administration said that &quot;help in tapping the telephones of politicians was never requested&quot; and that Stephenson was &quot;mistaken&quot; in her interpretation.

In December 2011, former military ruler Manuel Noriega was extradited from France to Panama by Martinelli&#x27;s government. Critics charged that Martinelli had requested the extradition to turn public attention away from administration scandals, an accusation denied by Panamanian government.

== Honors and awards ==
On February 20, 2010, the University of Arkansas established the Ricardo A. Martinelli Berrocal Scholarship to provide financial aid to prospective University of Arkansas students from Panama. He was also presented with the Citation of Distinguished Alumnus award and was made an official ambassador of the State of Arkansas by Governor Mike Beebe.

On June 16, 2013, received and acknowledgement from the FAO in Rome, Italy, for helping to reduce the child malnutrition in the Panamanian territory. It took place during the 38th Session of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Conference. Martinelli was awarded besides other thirty seven countries.
** Grand Cross of the National Order of the Legion of Honour (July 14, 2013)
** Grand Cross of the National Order of Honour and Merit (February 18, 2014)
** Grand Collar of the Order of the Sun of Peru (August 26, 2010)
** Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry, Portugal (July 29, 2013)

** Knight Grand Cross, Special Class of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George (July 28, 2012)
** Grand Cordon of the Order of Brilliant Jade (November 1, 2010)

== Personal life ==
In 1978, Martinelli married Marta Linares, with whom he has three children: Ricardo Alberto Martinelli Linares, Luis Enrique Martinelli Linares, and Carolina Martinelli Linares. Ricardo and Luis Enrique are accused of having received at least 22 million dollars of the Brazilian company Odebrecht, involved in a vast scandal of corruption. The money had then been hidden on bank accounts in Switzerland.

===Legal issues===
====Corruption charges====
After leaving power in July 2014, the government of his successor, Juan Carlos Varela, launched a series of investigations related to cost overruns during the Martinelli government. In the investigations of the National Aid Program (PAN), cost overruns of more than 45 million dollars in dehydrated food were detected. In the investigations, two former directors have been arrested: Giacomo Tamburelli and Rafael Guardia. In the statements, both pointed out that Martinelli had ordered both purchases with cost overruns.53 After an investigation, the case was closed without evidence against the former president, since the Judicial Branch recognized that it could not gather elements of conviction to prove the prosecution.

Given the allegations, on January 28, 2015, an investigation was launched against Martinelli, with the unanimous vote of all the magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice, for &quot;alleged crimes against the public administration.&quot; However, Martinelli had left Panama hours earlier for Guatemala City, headquarters of the Central American Parliament (Parlacen), of which he serves as a deputy and, as such, argues that he has jurisdiction against criminal proceedings, which in 2012 he had described as &quot;cave of thieves &quot;; Relying on the fact that as a former president he is a Parlacen deputy, he denounced the current government in harsh terms and accusing President Varela of wanting to assassinate him, however the plenary session of Parlacen affirmed that he had no immunity, since if the National Assembly of Panama did not grants parliamentary immunity to local deputies, the Parlacen cannot either. After reporting what he described as a persecution against him to Parlacen, Martinelli took refuge in Miami.

Additionally, Martinelli has proceedings open for espionage and telephone interception of more than 150 people during his mandate, most of them opponents (including businessmen, independent journalists and magistrates). Because he was still in the United States and did not attend the preliminary hearing on December 11, 2015, he was declared in &quot;default&quot; by the guarantee judge Jerónimo Mejía and went to the plenary session of the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama. on whether Martinelli would be called to a hearing, ordering his &quot;provisional arrest&quot; on December 21.

====2017 U.S. arrest====
On June 12, 2017, Martinelli was arrested at Coral Gables in south Florida after a provisional arrest warrant issued by the U.S. Justice Department in response to a request from Panama and was set to appear on Federal Court.

Martinelli and Manuel Antonio Noriega, are the only Panamanian political leaders detained in the US for judicial processes of institutional gravity. In May 2017, Interpol issued a red notice (request for international arrest) for the extradition of Ricardo Martinelli, installed in Miami. Panamanian justice accused the former president of having spied on telephone conversations of about 150 people, including journalists and leaders of the opposition. Martinelli was arrested in Miami by U.S. Marshals on June 12, 2017, to face extradition to Panama. He was extradited to Panama on June 11, 2018, to face the wiretapping charges. On August 9, 2019, a 3-judge panel declared Ricardo Martinelli not guilty, the court cleared the former president of espionage and corruption during his administration and ordered him released from house arrest.

====In Spain====
A Spanish court could not find Martinelli in 2022. He is suspected to have hired a private security outfit (&quot;Group Kougar&quot;) in Mallorca, Spain, to spy on his lover while she was there in 2020. Group Kougar included members of the Spanish Civil Guard and Army. In 2021, the Spanish National Court accused Martinelli of corruption and money laundering in the construction of two lines of the Panama Metro and Ciudad de la Salud built by Odebrecht (see the Odebrecht Case), Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas and associates.

==== &quot;New Business&quot; money laundering case and asylum ====
On July 18, 2023, a criminal court in Panama sentenced Martinelli to more than 10 years in prison for money laundering, relating to the &quot;New Business&quot; case that dates back to 2017. The case concerns the 2010 purchase of a Panamanian national media company, with prosecutors claiming that Martinelli gave lucrative government contracts to businesses that later transferred money to the company &quot;New Business&quot;, a front Martinelli used to purchase the company. His conviction was upheld by the Panamanian Supreme Court on February 2, 2024, making him ineligible to run again for president in elections that he wanted to contest later in the year. His candidacy was formally revoked by the Panamanian electoral tribunal on March 4.

Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, Martinelli held a rally in Panama City in which he insisted that he would continue his presidential campaign. However, he later claimed that incumbent president Laurentino Cortizo was seeking to imprison and even kill him, which led him to seek refuge at the Nicaraguan embassy, with his lawyer saying that &quot;his life was in danger.” On February 7, the Nicaraguan foreign ministry announced that it had granted Martinelli asylum on the basis of political persecution and imminent risk to his life, and called on the Panamanian government to allow his departure to Nicaragua. On 9 February, the Panamanian foreign ministry denied the request, stating that the 1928 Convention on Asylum does not allow its signatories to grant asylum in their diplomatic missions to people condemned for common crimes. On 22 February, Panamanian authorities approved the cancellation of his conditional release and ordered his arrest.

<text>Claude Goudimel (c. 1514 to 1520 – between 28 August and 31 August 1572) was a French composer, music editor and publisher, and music theorist of the High Renaissance.

==Biography==
Claude Goudimel was born in Besançon, modern-day France, which at that time was a French-speaking imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. Few details of his life are known until he is documented in Paris in 1549, where he was studying at the University of Paris; in that year he also published a book of chansons. In the early 1550s he worked with printer , and may have still been studying at the University of Paris until 1555; by 1555 he was also Du Chemin&#x27;s partner in the publishing business.

Goudimel moved to Metz in 1557, converting to Protestantism, and is known to have been associated with the Huguenot cause there; however he left Metz due to the increasing hostility of the city authorities to Protestants during the Wars of Religion. First he settled in his native town of Besançon, and later moved to Lyon.

It is supposed Goudimel was murdered in Lyon in August 1572, during the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre, along with much of the Huguenot population of the city. His last letter to his close friend and poet Melissus, showing Goudimel sick with fever on 23 August 1572, allowed M. Weckerlin to suppose that instead of dying in the massacre of Saint Barthelemy, the master could have died quite simply in his bed. However, there is no definitive evidence to support or contradict either theory of his passing.

The death of Goudimel inspired among the versifiers of this time a respectable number of epitaphs, sonnets and other famous pieces in French, Latin and Greek. That by J. Posthius begins with these lines:

&#x27;Claudius, the sweet,

was preferred above the song of the swans,
and [was] the Orpheus of our time.&#x27;

==Music and influence==
Goudimel is most famous for his four-part settings of the psalms of the Genevan Psalter, in the French versions of Clément Marot. In one of his four complete editions he puts - unlike other settings at the time - the melody in the topmost voice, the method which has prevailed in hymnody to the present day. In addition he composed masses, motets, and a considerable body of secular chansons, almost all of which date from before his conversion to Protestantism (probably around 1560).

In 1554, he became the editor of a large collection of masses, motets and Magnificat of several composers, a collection printed by Nicolas Duchemin, and in which Goudimel appeared as the author of seven Latin and Catholic works. In the year following, Goudimel, still at Duchemin&#x27;s, brought out a book of pieces for four voices of his composition on the Odes of Horace. However, he felt some contrition about setting work of the pagan poet, and in 1557 he wrote:
&quot;To Monsieur de La Bloctière, Mr. Claude Belot, Angevin, advocate in the court of Parliament of Paris, C. Goudimel, his good friend, wishes good health. Sir, ... [I] present to you this third book of Music of mine on the divine verses of the divine and royal Prophet. Also in no way could I choose the man, who seems to me to favor this little work of better heart than you, who alone amiably forced me to change, even quit, the profane lyre of the profane poet Horace, to memorize in hand and boldly undertake to touch and wield the sacred harp of our great David.&quot;

Goudimel&#x27;s stay in Metz lasted several years. It was there that he addressed, in 1564, the dedication of his first complete psalter to &quot;Mgr Roger de Bellegarde, ordinary gentleman of the king&#x27;s room,&quot; and, in 1565, that of the second psalter to &quot;Mgr d&#x27;Auzances, knight of the Order and lieutenant general of the king.&quot; On 18 March 1565 he was named godfather of a child at the reformed church of this city. in 1566, he published his seventh book of psalms in the form of motets. It was, therefore, after his departure from Paris that the celebrities Adrien le Roy and Robert Ballard published his masses in 1558; and it was also during his time in Metz that Goudimel began to concentrate all of his artistic ability in the various musical interpretations of the French translation of the psalms by Clément Marot and Théodore de Bèze. He worked on the continuation of his large collection of motet-shaped psalms, and wrote almost simultaneously two different versions of the complete psalter, each containing one hundred and fifty psalms.

Goudimel&#x27;s style tends to be homophonic, with an intriguing use of syncopated rhythm and melisma and staggered voice entries to bring out inner parts, especially in the chansons. His Psalm settings, however, are more polyphonic, characteristic of the moderate contrapuntal style exemplified by the chansons of Jacques Arcadelt, an approximate contemporary.

The widespread claim that he taught Palestrina is now regarded as untenable. His Opera Omnia extends to 14 volumes, though several of his works are fragmentary, missing one or more voices.

<text>Thomas Digges (; c. 1546 – 24 August 1595) was an English mathematician and astronomer. He was the first to expound the Copernican system in English but discarded the notion of a fixed shell of immoveable stars to postulate infinitely many stars at varying distances. He was also first to postulate the &quot;dark night sky paradox&quot;.

==Life==
Thomas Digges, born about 1546, was the son of Leonard Digges (c. 1515 – c. 1559), the mathematician and surveyor, and Bridget Wilford, the daughter of Thomas Wilford, esquire, of Hartridge in Cranbrook, Kent, by his first wife, Elizabeth Culpeper, the daughter of Walter Culpeper, esquire. Digges had two brothers, James and Daniel, and three sisters, Mary, who married a man with the surname of Barber; Anne, who married William Digges; and Sarah, whose first husband was surnamed Martin, and whose second husband was John Weston.

After the death of his father, Digges grew up under the guardianship of John Dee, a typical Renaissance natural philosopher. In 1583, Lord Burghley appointed Digges, with John Chamber and Henry Savile, to sit on a commission to consider whether England should adopt the Gregorian calendar, as proposed by Dee.

Digges served as a member of parliament for Wallingford and also had a military career as a Muster-Master General to the English forces from 1586 to 1594 during the war with the Spanish Netherlands. In his capacity of Master-Muster General he was instrumental in promoting improvements at the Port of Dover.

Digges died on 24 August 1595. His last will, in which he specifically excluded both his brother, James Digges, and William Digges, was proved on 1 September. Digges was buried in the chancel of the church of St Mary Aldermanbury, London.

==Marriage and issue==
Digges married Anne St Leger (1555–1636), daughter of Sir Warham St Leger and his first wife, Ursula Neville (d. 1575), the fifth daughter of George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny, by his third wife, Mary Stafford. In his will he named two surviving sons, Sir Dudley Digges (1583–1639), politician and statesman, and Leonard Digges (1588–1635), poet, and two surviving daughters, Margaret and Ursula. After Digges&#x27;s death, his widow, Anne, married Thomas Russell of Alderminster in Warwickshire, &quot;whom in 1616 William Shakespeare named as an overseer of his will&quot;.

==Work==

Digges attempted to determine the parallax of the 1572 supernova observed by Tycho Brahe, and concluded it had to be beyond the orbit of the Moon. This contradicted Aristotle&#x27;s view of the universe, according to which no change could take place among the fixed stars.

In 1576, he published a new edition of his father&#x27;s perpetual almanac, &quot;A Prognostication everlasting&quot;. The text written by Leonard Digges for the third edition of 1556 was left unchanged, but Thomas added new material in several appendices. The most important of these was &quot;A Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the Pythagoreans, latelye revived by Copernicus and by Geometricall Demonstrations approved&quot;. Contrary to the Ptolemaic cosmology of the original book by his father, the appendix featured a detailed discussion of the controversial and still poorly known Copernican heliocentric model of the Universe. This was the first publication of that model in English, and a milestone in the popularisation of science.
For the most part, the appendix was a loose translation into English of chapters from Copernicus&#x27; book &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;. Thomas Digges went further than Copernicus, however, by proposing that the universe is infinite, containing infinitely many stars, and may have been the first person to do so, predating Giordano Bruno&#x27;s (1584) and William Gilbert&#x27;s (1600) same views. According to Harrison:

An illustration of the Copernican universe can be seen above right. The outer inscription on the map reads (after spelling adjustments from Elizabethan to Modern English):
In 1583, Lord Burghley appointed Digges, along with Henry Savile (Bible translator) and John Chamber, to sit on a commission to consider whether England should adopt the Gregorian calendar, as proposed by John Dee; in fact Britain did not adopt the calendar until 1752.

<text>A swing is a seat or platform, suspended from chains, ropes, or bars, on which one or more people can swing back and forth for enjoyment or relaxation. Swings are a common piece of equipment at children&#x27;s playgrounds and may also be found in yards or gardens, on porches, inside homes (for example, the Indian oonjal), or as freestanding public play equipment like the Estonian village swing. Swings have a long history in many different parts of the world and come in various types.

On playgrounds, several swings are often suspended from a shared metal or wooden frame, known as a swing set, allowing more than one child to play at a time. Such swings come in a variety of sizes and shapes. For infants and toddlers, swings with leg holes support the child in an upright position while a parent or sibling pushes the child to get a swinging motion. Some swing sets include play items other than swings, such as a rope ladder or sliding pole.

For older children, swings are sometimes made of a flexible canvas seat, of a rubberized ventilated tire tread, of plastic, or of wood. A common backyard sight is a wooden plank suspended on both sides by ropes from a tree branch.

==Types==
Tire swings are a form of swing made from a whole tire. These are often simply a new or used tire hanging from a tree on a rope. On commercially-developed playground swing sets, oversized new tires are often reinforced with a circular metal bar to improve safety and are hung on chains from metal or wooden beams. They may hang vertically or hang flat, suspended from three or more points on one side. The flat version can hold three or more children. Pumping is achieved by using one or two of the three chains attached to the swing, and two (or more) children can pump in turn.

Tire swings can also be used in &quot;spinners&quot;, where the occupants use their feet to propel the tire.

Natural swings may be created by lianas (creeper plants) in a subtropical wild forest like Aokigahara forest near Mount Fuji.

Rope swings are swings created by tying one end of a length of rope to a tree branch, bridge, or other elevated structure. A knot or loop is usually put on the other end to prevent fraying and help the swinger stay on. Rope swings are often situated so that those swinging on them can let go and land in water deep enough to cushion the fall and to be swum around in.

The incorporation of a shortboard such as a skateboard in which the rider stands is called swing boarding. It is made safer by the use of an attached board and a harness for the rider.

Baby swings are swings with a bucket shape with holes for the child&#x27;s legs, or a half-bucket shape and a safety belt, that is intended to reduce the likelihood of a very young child from falling out. These are sometimes known as bucket swings.

 are swinging, bench-like seats, typically of painted wood and intended primarily for adults. The swing&#x27;s suspension chains are permanently mounted to the porch ceiling; and the seat is typically large enough to seat about three people, with an armrest at each end. Porch swings are an alternative to using rocking chairs or gliders outdoors.

Canopy swings are similar to porch swings, but they are hung on a separate frame and are usually portable. The name is derived from a canopy installed as a sunshade.

Hammock swings are portable (removable) bed-swings made of a lightweight material such as canvas, netting (or as little as two ropes), typically suspended between two trees or attached to a hammock stand.
Nest swings resemble bird nests in shape and are able to carry multiple people. One or two people propel it by standing on the sides, grabbing the shackles that mount the basket to its typically wooden stand, and tilting it sideways. They are typically installed on playgrounds.

Tandem swings are swings designed for use by two people at the same time, facing each other or back-to-back, and are almost always part of a swing set due to the frame required to support the weights of the riders. The bench is perpendicular to its frame&#x27;s center crossbar. Face-to-face tandem benches include a subframe with integrated handles and foot pegs. Face-to-face tandem swings are known in some regions of North America as a &quot;teeter-totter&quot; (not to be confused with the seesaw which it superficially resembles). Back-to-back tandems are typically in the baby bucket design, but with two pairs of leg holes, one on each side of the bench. Tandem swings are typically suspended from their frame (as in kiiking) by steel bars, although ropes and chains may be used for those used only by smaller children. Face-to-face tandem swings were featured in the playground of the Columbia Gardens.

==History==

===Asia===
There is a common myth that swinging first spread throughout China during the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC). In the modern myth, during the Han dynasty swinging continued to rise in popularity and was often performed at the Qingming Festival and the Duanwu Festival. However, this myth has no basis in evidence. The origin of the myth was originally written in a lost book at some point around the 3rd century to 5th century, and the myth is stated in quotations of that book as simply &quot;Others say that&quot;, showing it is a myth, not based on any historical record. By the time of the Song dynasty, swinging became involved in professional acrobatics, where performers would swing between boats over water.

===Europe===
The earliest known representations of swings come from artifacts found in Greece. A terracotta sculpture of a woman sitting on a swing found at Hagia Triada dates to the Late New Palace period (1450–1300 BC). The swing was called &quot;aeora&quot; or &quot;eora&quot; (αἰώρα, ἐώρα) and there are representation of people sitting and playing with a swing in ancient Greek art.

In Eastern Europe, Slavic traditions associate swinging with courting and with crop-fertility rituals.

In the 1700s, French artists depicted scenes of nobility swinging recreationally.

Charles Wicksteed (1847-1931) has the reputation of inventing the modern-day playground swing. One of his prototypes, unearthed in 2013 near Wicksteed Park in the United Kingdom, dates back to the early 1920s.

In 1993, the sport of Kiiking was invented in Estonia. Players attempt to rotate 360 degrees around a spindle, on a long swing consisting of a seat hung with steel bars.

===North America===
In the early 1900s, the playground movement saw swings installed in public spaces for neighborhood children. By the middle of the century, the suburban playground became popular. Many Americans put personal swing sets on their property. Public concern for children&#x27;s safety influenced a change in design after the 1970s. Tubular metal sets were replaced with smaller swings made of woods and resins better suited for children.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office was disparaged in 2002 for issuing a patent to a five-year-old boy who claimed to have invented swinging sideways as a new form of entertainment. His father, a patent lawyer who wanted to show his son how the patent system worked, had told the boy that he could file a patent application on anything that he invented. The patent was rescinded upon re-examination.

==Physics of swinging==
A swing can be considered a type of pendulum which oscillates about the fixed pivot at the top. The rider&#x27;s gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy during the downward portion of the swinging motion and then back into potential energy on the upswing. When left to swing freely, the amplitude of motion will gradually decay due to air resistance and friction in the pivot. To maintain a continuous swinging motion it is necessary to add energy to the system, either by a second person pushing the swing or by the rider moving their body in a &quot;pumping&quot; motion. To pump the swing while seated, the rider alternates between two body positions: leaning back with legs extended during the forward swing, and then sitting upright with legs tucked during the back-swing. It is also possible to pump a swing by using a similar rocking motion while standing.

The action of pumping drives the swing via a combination of two different mechanisms. The first is driven harmonic oscillation in which the driving force arises from the rotation of the rider&#x27;s body as it transitions from one position to the other. This rotation creates angular momentum about the center of mass of the swing-rider system which is exchanged for angular momentum about the swing pivot (due to conservation of total angular momentum), thereby increasing the kinetic energy of the swing. Physicist William B. Case reported that this mechanism can be demonstrated by means of a bicycle wheel mounted on the end of a pendulum. When the wheel is made to rotate one way and then the other, matching the pendulum&#x27;s natural frequency, the pendulum will begin to swing with gradually increasing amplitude. Both mathematical modeling and experimental studies of human subjects have found that driven oscillation is the dominant mechanism for most seated and standing pumping motions.

The second mechanism is parametric oscillation, where the driving force arises from varying a system parameter (in this case pendulum length) at a specific frequency. If the center of mass of the swing-rider system shifts closer to the pivot point during the upward portion of the swinging motion, the moment of inertia is reduced and the swing gains kinetic energy due to conservation of angular momentum (the same mechanism that causes a figure skater to spin faster when they tuck their arms and legs closer to their body). One way to achieve this involves crouching as the swing reaches its highest point and then quickly standing up as it passes its lowest point. Based on observations of U.S. children, Case noted, &quot;Although it is certainly possible to pump a swing with the purely vertical motion one finds that this is not the mechanism of choice at the playground.&quot; However, pumping by standing and squatting is used in other parts of the world, for example in the Estonian sport of kiiking. Typical seated pumping also includes a parametric contribution due to the rider sitting up as they approach the top of the forward swing, though the effect is small compared with the driven oscillation mechanism.

===Swinging over the bar===

It is not possible under realistic conditions to swing &quot;over the bar&quot; (i.e., make a full 360-degree rotation) on a swing supported by ropes or chains because the swing must travel at a very high velocity in order to maintain tension in the chain throughout a full circular rotation. Once the chain angle passes 90 degrees from the rest position, the radial component of the gravitational force acting on the swing begins to pull &quot;toward&quot; the center of rotation rather than away as it does for smaller angles. If the centrifugal force felt by the swing due to its rotational motion is not sufficient to overcome this radial gravitational force, the swing trajectory will decay until the chain becomes taut again (at which point the rider experiences a jerk). Bickel et al. determined that, at least in an ideal case, the swing follows a parabolic path in this situation. The same authors also derived an expression for the &quot;critical&quot; initial velocity which would allow the swing to make a full circular rotation:

formula_1

where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration and &quot;l&quot; is the chain length. Therefore, if the chain is 2 meters long, the swing must travel at 9.9 meters per second (about 22 miles per hour) at the start of the upswing in order to complete a full rotation. This is not achievable without an external source of propulsion. In contrast, it is entirely possible to go over the bar on a swing with rigid supports, although it becomes more difficult as the length of the supports is increased. This is the basis of the sport of kiiking.

==Dangers==
Swings can cause various types of injuries. The most common injury is due to a fall, either by unintentionally letting go of the ropes or chains or by deliberately jumping out of the swing. Less commonly, the person using the swing will bump into or kick another person who is walking by or playing too close to the swing, or (especially with improperly located home equipment) will bump into a fence, wall, or another fixed object. Swings are also associated with strangulation or hanging injuries, usually because the child was wearing a piece of clothing or other item that became entangled in the swing.

Swings are the most common cause of injury relating to playground equipment at private homes, but a much less common cause of injury in public or school playgrounds, where injuries from climbing equipment dominate. Injuries from swings primarily affect school-age children, but preschool-age children also have a significant risk on swing sets at home.

== Potential benefits ==
Swinging teaches full body coordination and improves the sensory system of a child. It develops spatial awareness, gross and fine motor skills. It works out the entire body from pumping legs to grip strength. Swinging also helps teach the child rhythm and balance, and encourages social interaction as children must cooperate and play together. In his 1885 poem, &quot;The Swing,&quot; published in A Child&#x27;s Garden of Verses, Robert Louis Stevenson exclaimed that going &quot;up in a swing&quot; was &quot;the pleasantest thing/ Ever a child can do.&quot;

<doc id="628093" wikidata="Q2141836" url="?curid=628093" title="Chemical burn">
<text>A chemical burn occurs when living tissue is exposed to a corrosive substance (such as a strong acid, base or oxidizer) or a cytotoxic agent (such as mustard gas, lewisite or arsine). Chemical burns follow standard burn classification and may cause extensive tissue damage. The main types of irritant and/or corrosive products are: acids, bases, oxidizers / reducing agents, solvents, and alkylants. Additionally, chemical burns can be caused by biological toxins (such as anthrax toxin) and by some types of cytotoxic chemical weapons, e.g., vesicants such as mustard gas and Lewisite, or urticants such as phosgene oxime.

Chemical burns may:
* need no source of heat
* occur immediately on contact
* not be immediately evident or noticeable
* be extremely painful
* diffuse into tissue and damage cellular structures under skin without immediately apparent damage to skin surface
Exposure to a toxic substance that is insufficient to cause a chemical burn can still be very serious, and the lack of a noticeable effect from a chemical exposure is not an indication of safety, particularly in the case of chronic exposure.

==Presentation==
The exact symptoms of a chemical burn depend on the chemical involved. Symptoms include itching, bleaching or darkening of skin, burning sensations, trouble breathing, coughing blood and/or tissue necrosis. Common sources of chemical burns include sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), lime (CaO), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Effects depend on the substance; hydrogen peroxide removes a bleached layer of skin, while nitric acid causes a characteristic color change to yellow in the skin, and silver nitrate produces noticeable black stains. Chemical burns may occur through direct contact on body surfaces, including skin and eyes, via inhalation, and/or by ingestion. Substances that diffuse efficiently in human tissue, e.g., hydrofluoric acid, sulfur mustard, and dimethyl sulfate, may not react immediately, but instead produce the burns and inflammation hours after the contact. Chemical fabrication, mining, medicine, and related professional fields are examples of occupations where chemical burns may occur. Hydrofluoric acid leaches into the bloodstream, reacts with calcium and magnesium, and the resulting salts can cause cardiac arrest after eating through skin.

==Prevention==

In Belgium, the Conseil Supérieur de la Santé gives a scientific advisory report on public health policy. The Superior Health Council of Belgium provides an overview of products that are authorized in Belgium for consumer use and that contain caustic substances, as well as of the risks linked to exposure to these products. This report aims at suggesting protection measures for the consumers, and formulates recommendations that apply to the different stages of the chain, which begins with the formulation of the product, followed by its regulation, marketing, application, post-application and ends with its monitoring.

<doc id="628094" wikidata="Q7439031" url="?curid=628094" title="Screen filter">
<text>A screen filter is a type of water purification using a rigid or flexible screen to separate sand and other fine particles out of water for irrigation or industrial applications. These are generally not recommended for filtering out organic matter such as algae, since these types of contaminants can be extruded into spaghetti-like strings through the filter if enough pressure drop occurs across the filter surface. Typical screen materials include stainless steel (mesh), polypropylene, nylon and polyester.

== Use ==

Self-cleaning screen filters incorporate an automatic backwash cycle to overcome these limitations. Backwash cycles are far more frequent when compared to a media filter with similar capacity, and each backwash requires far less water to perform. Their ability to quickly remove contaminants from water before they leach their nutrients make such filters popular choices for recirculating aquaculture systems. They have also become popular in closed loop industrial systems such as cooling tower, heat exchanger, and other equipment protection applications. Similar devices with larger openings designed only to keep out large objects are called strainers.

Stainless-steel strainers are used in industrial, municipal, and irrigation applications, and can be designed for very high flow rates. When paired with a controller and flush valve, a strainer can be fully automated. Suspended particles collect on the inside of the screen, and the flush valve opens to expel the buildup. This eliminates the need for manual cleaning of the strainer element.

<text>WSVH (91.1 FM) is a 96,000-watt public radio station broadcasting from Savannah, Georgia, and transmitting from the WVAN-TV 9 (GPB TV) tower to the west in Pembroke, Georgia, north of Fort Stewart. It provides the radio service of Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) serves the upper Georgia coast and areas well inland, and adjacent areas of far southern South Carolina.

The station&#x27;s signal is simulcast by GPB-owned WWIO-FM 88.9 in Brunswick, Georgia. Together, the two stations serve the entire Georgia coastline. Their signals can be heard from Beaufort, South Carolina to Fernandina Beach, Florida.

==History==

Georgia Public Radio, Inc. (of no relation to GPB) was formed by local residents to build a public radio station for Savannah after locals had occasionally received public stations in Charleston, South Carolina, and Jacksonville, Florida. The station began broadcasting on April 20, 1981, with the first piece played on the station at 6 a.m. being Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;.

In 1988, after surveying financial supporters, WSVH merged with Peach State Public Radio, the new state-owned service that had begun in 1985 to provide public radio to much of the unserved part of the state. In the early 1990s, the listening area was greatly improved with the addition of WWIO in extreme southeast Georgia; an overnight classical-music format was also added. In 1997, the station moved its studio from downtown Savannah to the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography on Skidaway Island, just south of Savannah. In August 2011, the WSVH/WWIO studios moved again to space at the Armstrong Center of Armstrong State University.

In past years, WSVH was one of two member stations of the GPB Radio network to have local announcers and underwriting during the day. WSVH produced four radio programs for the GPB network: Celtic program &quot;The Green Island Radio Show&quot; with Harry O&#x27;Donoghue, folk show &quot;Music Americana&quot; with Russell Wells, &quot;Classical Tonight&quot;, also hosted by Russell Wells, and the overnight classical block &quot;Coastal Nocturne&quot;.

<text>Chamaenerion angustifolium is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant in the willowherb family, Onagraceae. It is known in North America as fireweed and in Britain and Ireland as rosebay willowherb. It is also known by the synonyms &quot;Chamerion angustifolium&quot; and &quot;Epilobium angustifolium&quot;. It is native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, including large parts of the boreal forests.

==Description==

The reddish stems of this herbaceous perennial are usually simple, erect, smooth, high with scattered alternate leaves. The leaves are spirally arranged, entire, narrowly lanceolate, and pinnately veined, the secondary leaf veins anastomosing, joining together to form a continuous marginal vein just inside the leaf margins.

The inflorescence is a symmetrical terminal raceme that blooms progressively from bottom to top, producing a gracefully tapered shape. The flowers are in diameter, slightly asymmetrical, with four magenta to pink petals and four narrower pink sepals behind. The protruding style has four stigmas. The floral formula is ✶/↓ K4 C4 A4+4 or 4+0 Ğ(4).

The upright, reddish-brown linear seed capsule splits from the apex and curls open. It bears many minute brown seeds, about 300 to 400 per capsule and 80,000 per plant. The seeds have silky hairs to aid wind dispersal and are very easily spread by the wind, often becoming a weed and a dominant species on disturbed ground. Once established, the plants also spread extensively by underground roots, an individual plant eventually forming a large patch.

== Taxonomy ==
This species has been placed in the genus &quot;Chamaenerion&quot; (sometimes given as &quot;Chamerion&quot;) rather than &quot;Epilobium&quot; based on several morphological distinctions: spiral (rather than opposite or whorled) leaf arrangement; absence (rather than presence) of a hypanthium; subequal stamens (rather than stamens in two unequal whorls); zygomorphic (rather than actinomorphic) stamens and stigma. Under this taxonomic arrangement, &quot;Chamaenerion&quot; and &quot;Epilobium&quot; are monophyletic sister genera.

Two subspecies are recognized as valid:
* &quot;Chamaenerion angustifolium&quot; subsp. &quot;angustifolium&quot;
* &quot;Chamaenerion angustifolium&quot; subsp. &quot;circumvagum&quot; 

=== Etymology ===
The generic name &quot;Chamaenerion&quot; means &quot;dwarf rosebay&quot; in allusion to the outward similarity to rosebay, &quot;Nerium oleander&quot;, while the specific epithet &quot;angustifolium&quot; means &quot;narrow-leaved&quot;. It is commonly known in Britain as &quot;rosebay willowherb&quot;, for the same reason. The common American name &quot;fireweed&quot; derives from the species&#x27; abundance as a colonizer on burnt sites after forest fires and other disturbances.

== Ecology ==

Fireweed is often abundant in wet calcareous to slightly acidic soils in open fields, pastures, and particularly burned-over lands. It is a pioneer species that quickly colonizes open areas with little competition, such as the sites of forest fires and forest clearings. Plants grow and flower as long as there is open space and plenty of light. Fireweed reaches its average peak colonization after five years and then begins to be replaced as trees and brush grow larger. When a new fire or other disturbance occurs that opens up the ground to light again, the seeds germinate. Some areas with heavy seed counts in the soil can, after burning, be covered with pure dense stands of this species and when in flower the landscape is turned into fields of color.

Fireweed is an effective colonizer; it may not be present until after a fire has moved through a landscape. Because of its very high dispersal capacity, &quot;propagule pressure&quot; from its regional presence will let it quickly colonize a disturbed area. Once seedlings are established, the plant quickly reproduces and covers the disturbed area via seeds and rhizomes. It is somewhat adapted to fire as well and so can prevent the reintroduction of fire to the landscape. Fireweed is well adapted to seed in severely burned areas as well, because the mineral soil that is exposed due to the removal of organic soil layers provides a good seedbed.

In Britain the plant was considered a rare species in the 18th century, and one confined to a few locations with damp, gravelly soils. It was misidentified as great hairy willowherb in contemporary floras. The plant&#x27;s rise from local rarity to widespread abundance seems to have occurred at the same time as the expansion of the railway network and the associated soil disturbance. The plant became locally known as &#x27;bombweed&#x27; due to its rapid colonization of bomb craters in the Second World War.

Bears and elk are known to favor the plant as food.

===Pollination===
The flowers are visited by a wide variety of insects (the generalised pollination syndrome). Some species in the insect order Lepidoptera frequently use the willowherb as their primary larval host-plant, examples including the elephant hawk moth (&quot;Deilephila elpenor&quot;), bedstraw hawk moth (&quot;Hyles gallii&quot;), and the white-lined sphinx moth (&quot;Hyles lineata&quot;).

==Uses==
The plant is not considered palatable, but the young shoots and leaves can be cooked and eaten. Fresh leaves can be eaten raw. The young flowers are also edible (being made into jelly in the Yukon) and the stems of older plants can be split to extract the edible raw pith. The root can be roasted after scraping off the outside, but often tastes bitter. To mitigate this, the root is collected before the plant flowers and the brown thread in the middle removed. The stem centers can also be prepared by splitting the outer stalk, and eaten raw.

Traditionally the young shoots are collected in the spring by Native American and Siberian people and mixed with other greens. As the plant matures, the leaves become tough and somewhat bitter. Fireweed petals are made into jelly, and mature leaves are dried for use as tea. Roots are traditionally eaten raw by Siberian Native people. When properly prepared soon after picking they are a good source of vitamin C and provitamin A. The Denaʼina add fireweed to their dogs&#x27; food. Fireweed is also a medicine of the Upper Inlet Dena&#x27;ina, who treat pus-filled boils or cuts by placing a piece of the raw stem on the afflicted area. This is said to draw the pus out of the cut or boil and prevents a cut with pus in it from healing over too quickly.

The leaves can be used to make tea. In Russia, fireweed is made into a tea known as Ivan-Chai (Ivan-Tea)&lt;ref name=&quot;DOI_10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04632&quot;&gt;AUGUST 01, 2020, Julia Prakofjewa, Raivo Kalle, Olga Belichenko, Valeria Kolosova, Renata Sõukand Re-written narrative: transformation of the image of Ivan-chaj in Eastern Europe, Heliyon, RESEARCH ARTICLE, VOLUME 6, ISSUE 8, E04632,&lt;/ref&gt; or Koporsky tea (from the town of Koporye, where it has been produced since the 13th century). They use it as highly prized medicinal herb too. The popularity of fireweed tea perhaps stems from the similarity of its production to that of common black tea (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;), leading to a richly flavoured and deeply coloured herbal tea, with no caffeine, it is commercially sold in a blend with mint or thyme. Fireweed tea is high in iron, copper, potassium and calcium.

The honey produced from fireweed is highly valued for its quality. Most fireweed honey is produced in locations in cool climates, such as the Pacific Northwest in the United States and Scandinavian countries in Europe.

Fireweed&#x27;s natural variation in ploidy has prompted its use in scientific studies of the possible effects of polyploidy on adaptive potential and species diversification.

Because fireweed can colonize disturbed sites, even following an old oil spill, it is often used to re-establish vegetation.

It is also grown as an ornamental plant. A white form, &quot;C. angustifolium&quot; &#x27;Album&#x27;, is listed by the Royal Horticultural Society.

=== Land management ===
Because of its rapid establishment on disturbed land, fireweed can be used for land management purposes. Events such as logging, fires and mass wasting can leave the land barren and without vegetation. This causes the land to be more susceptible to erosion because of the lack of root structure in the soil. Fireweed is a useful tool that can be utilized after prescribed fires and logging events because of its fire resistance and ability to recycle the nutrients left in the soil after a fire. It is also able to quickly establish a root system for reproduction and through this can prevent mass wasting and erosion events from occurring on burned or logged hillsides. Reestablishment of vegetation is crucial in the recovery time of disturbed lands. In many cases, fireweed establishes itself on these disturbed lands, but implementing the introduction of fireweed to a disturbed area as a management practice could prove useful in speeding up the recovery of disturbed lands. Disturbed and burned over lands are generally unpleasant to look at and pose a risk to habitats and nearby communities because of their susceptibility to mass wasting events. Fireweed can quickly establish itself across the landscape and prevent further damage, while providing a blanket of vegetation for recovering fauna to create new habitats in and for pollinators to foster the re-establishment of a diverse set of flora.

==In culture==
Fireweed has been referred to in poetry and prose since at least the 19th century. Rudyard Kipling wrote, &quot;The fire-weed glows in the centre of the drive ways&quot;. In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (1954), J. R. R. Tolkien lists fireweed as one of the flowering plants returning to the site of a bonfire inside the Old Forest.

As the first plant to colonise waste ground, fireweed is often mentioned in postwar British literature. The children&#x27;s novel &quot;Fireweed&quot; is set during the Blitz and features two runaway teenagers who meet on bomb sites where fireweed is growing profusely. Another children&#x27;s novel, &quot;A Reflection of Rachel&quot; features a protagonist attempting to restore an old garden that used &quot;Rose Pink Willow Herb&quot; as an ornamental plant and mentions its notoriety for growing on abandoned bomb sites. Cicely Mary Barker&#x27;s 1948 book &quot;Flower Fairies of the Wayside&quot; included an illustration of &#x27;The Rose-Bay Willow-Herb Fairy&#x27;, with the accompanying verse &quot;On the breeze my fluff is blown; So my airy seeds are sown. Where the earth is burnt and sad, I will come to make it glad. All forlorn and ruined places, All neglected empty spaces, I can cover—only think!— With a mass of rosy pink.&quot;

Rosebay Willowherb was voted the county flower of London in 2002 following a poll by the wild plant conservation charity Plantlife.
Fireweed is the floral emblem of Yukon.

<doc id="628111" wikidata="Q1415361" url="?curid=628111" title="Hydrocyclone">
<text>Hydrocyclones are a type of cyclonic separators that separate product phases mainly on basis of differences in gravity with aqueous solutions as the primary feed fluid.

As opposed to dry or dust cyclones, which separate solids from gasses, hydrocyclones separate solids or different phase fluids from the bulk fluid. A hydrocyclone comprises a cylindrical shaped feed part with tangential feed; an overflow part with vortex finder; a conical part with an apex. A cyclone has no moving parts.

== Working principle ==
Product is fed into the hydrocyclone tangentially under a certain pressure. This creates a centrifugal movement, pushing the heavier phase outward and downward alongside the wall of the conical part. The decreasing diameter in the conical part increases the speed and so enhances the separation. Finally, the concentrated solids are discharged through the apex. The vortex finder in the overflow part creates a fast rotating upward spiral movement of the fluid in the centre of the conically shaped housing. The fluid is discharged through the overflow outlet.

== Cyclone parameters ==
The following parameters are decisive for good cyclone operation:
*the design
*the specific weight difference between the two product phases
*the shape of the solids
*the speed of the feed
*the density of the medium
*the counter pressure at the overflow and apex

== Areas of application ==

The main areas of application for hydrocyclones are:

*Mineral processing industry Hydrocyclones are frequently utilized in the metallurgical and mineral processing industry for the classification of fine particles and dewatering of slurries.
*In coal washery units : When magnetite and water are used as media in a cyclone then it is called a Dense Media Cyclone (DMC). DMCs are frequently used for washing coal.
*Starch industry Hydrocyclones are commonplace in the potato starch, cassava starch (tapioca), wheat starch and corn starch industry for the concentration and refining of starch slurries.
*The potato processing industry Hydrocyclones are used for the separation of starch from cutting water in the French fries and potato crisp and potato flakes industry.
*Sand separation and classification Hydrocyclones used for sand separation and classification and as a separator of sand from water or sludge 
*Oil-water separation: Separation of oil and water in, among other things, the offshore industry
*Dewatering: Concentration of slurry and dewater sludge for disposal 
*Microplastic separation: Removal of microplastics from wastewater

<doc id="628113" wikidata="Q249775" url="?curid=628113" title="Labrador tea">
<text>Labrador tea is a common name for three closely related plant species in the genus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; as well as a herbal tea made from their leaves. All three species are primarily wetland plants in the heath family. Labrador tea has been a favorite beverage for a long time among the Dene and Inuit peoples.

==Description==
All three species used to make Labrador tea are low, slow-growing shrubs with evergreen leaves:
* &quot;Rhododendron tomentosum&quot; (northern Labrador tea, previously &quot;Ledum palustre&quot;),
* &quot;Rhododendron groenlandicum&quot;, (bog Labrador tea, previously &quot;Ledum groenlandicum&quot; or &quot;Ledum latifolium&quot;) and
* &quot;Rhododendron neoglandulosum&quot;, (western Labrador tea, or trapper&#x27;s tea, previously &quot;Ledum glandulosum&quot; or &quot;Ledum columbianum&quot;).

The leaves are smooth on top with often wrinkled edges, and fuzzy white to red-brown underneath, and point straight to the sides or downward.

&quot;R. tomentosum&quot;, &quot;R. groenlandicum&quot;, and &quot;R. neoglandulosum&quot; can be found in wetlands and peat bogs.

==Uses==
The Athabaskans and other indigenous peoples brew the leaves as a beverage. The Pomo, Kashaya, Tolowa and Yurok of Northern California boil the leaves of western Labrador tea similarly, to make a medicinal herbal tea to help with coughs and colds. Botanical extracts from the leaves have been used to create natural skin care products by companies in Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador. Others use Labrador tea to spice meat by boiling the leaves and branches in water and then soaking the meat in the decoction.

During the eighteenth century, German brewers used &quot;R. tomentosum&quot; while brewing beer to make it more intoxicating, but it became forbidden because it was thought to led to increased aggression.

==Toxicology==
There is no sufficient data that demonstrates Labrador tea is safe to consume, as toxicity varies across species and localities. Excessive consumption is not recommended due to diuresis, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness. Large doses can lead to cramps, convulsions, paralysis, and, in rare cases, death.

Toxicity occurs due to the terpenoid ledol which is found in all Labrador tea species. &quot;R. groenlandicum&quot; has the lowest toxicity due to lower levels of ledol. Moderately narcotic Grayanotoxins are also present, but few lethal human cases of poisoning solely due to grayanotoxins have been documented. However, lethal poisonings have been documented in livestock.

==Harvesting==
Tea leaves are collected from multiple plants in the spring. Labrador tea is slow-growing, so only a single new leaf is collected from a plant every other year, to avoid damaging individual plants.

<text>Ribes triste, known as the northern redcurrant, swamp redcurrant, or wild redcurrant, is an Asian and North American shrub in the gooseberry family.

== Description ==
It grows to tall, with a lax, often creeping branches. The leaves are alternate, across, hairy below, and palmate with 3–5 lobes.

From June to July, 6–13 small, purplish flowers are displayed in pendulous racemes, long. The axis of the raceme is glandular. The fruit is a bright red berry, without the hairs that some currants have; it is rather sour.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Ribes triste&quot; is widespread across Canada and the northern United States, as well as in eastern Asia (Russia, China, Korea, Japan). It grows in wet rocky woods, swamps, and cliffs.

== As a weed ==
&quot;Ribes&quot; is listed a plant pest in Michigan and the planting of it in certain parts of the state is prohibited.

== Conservation ==
It is listed as endangered in Connecticut and Ohio, and as threatened in Pennsylvania.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
The berries are edible. Alaska Natives eat them raw and make them into jam and jellies. Eskimos eat the berries and the Inupiat eat them raw or cooked, mix them with other berries which are used to make a traditional dessert. They also mix the berries with rosehips and highbush cranberries and boil them into a syrup. The Iroquois mash the fruit, make them into small cakes, and store them for future use. They later soak the fruit cakes in warm water and cooked them a sauce or mixed them with corn bread. They also sun dry or fire dry the raw or cooked fruit for future use and take the dried fruit with them as a hunting food. The Ojibwe eat the berries raw, and also preserve them by cooking them, spreading them on birch bark into little cakes, which are dried and stored for winter use. In the winter, they often eat the berries with cooked sweet corn. They also use the berries to make jams and preserves. The Upper Tanana eat the berries as food.

===Medicinal===
The Ojibwe take a decoction of the root and stalk for kidney stones (&#x27;gravel&#x27;) and a compound decoction of the stalk to curtail menstruation; the leaves are used as a &#x27;female remedy&#x27;. The Upper Tanana use a decoction of the stems without the bark as a wash for sore eyes.

<text>London After Midnight (original working title: The Hypnotist) is a lost 1927 American silent mystery horror film directed and co-produced by Tod Browning and starring Lon Chaney, with Marceline Day, Conrad Nagel, Henry B. Walthall and Polly Moran. The film was distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was written by Waldemar Young, based on the story &quot;The Hypnotist&quot; which was written by Browning. Merritt B. Gerstad was the cinematographer, and the sets were designed by Cedric Gibbons and Arnold Gillespie. Harry Sharrock was the assistant director. The film cost $151,666.14 to produce, and grossed $1,004,000 (). Chaney&#x27;s real-life make-up case can be seen in the last scene of the film sitting on a table, the only time it ever appeared in a film.

Browning remade the film as a talkie in 1935, as &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot;, starring Bela Lugosi.

The last known copy of the film was destroyed in the 1965 MGM vault fire, making it one of the most sought-after lost silent films. In 2002, Turner Classic Movies aired a reconstructed version, produced by Rick Schmidlin, using the original script and numerous film stills to recreate the original plot.

==Plot==
Roger Balfour is found dead in his London home one night. Burke, a representative of Scotland Yard, after questioning everyone present, declares the death a suicide despite objection from Balfour&#x27;s neighbour and close friend, Sir James Hamlin.

Five years later, the Hamlin residents witness strange lights within the now-forsaken Balfour mansion before realizing the new tenants to be two vampiric figures of a man in a beaver-felt top hat with long hair and sharp teeth, and a silent pale woman wearing long robes. This prompts the baronet, Sir James, to call Burke in once again who discovers that Hamlin and the others there (Balfour&#x27;s daughter, Lucille; his butler, Williams; and Hamlin&#x27;s nephew, Arthur Hibbs) had been the only other persons in the Balfour home when he died. After noticing the new lease to the Balfour mansion bears the exact same signature as the deceased Roger Balfour&#x27;s, Burke remains skeptical about the existence of the undead, and, along with Sir James, exhumes Roger Balfour&#x27;s tomb to find it empty. After a series of grisly events; from the maid Miss Smithson&#x27;s eccentric recollection of encountering the Man in the Beaver Hat manifesting in a bedroom, to the vampire girl flying down like a bat from the ceiling of the Balfour mansion, and witnessing the living corpse of Roger Balfour, Burke reveals to Lucille that he believes her father to have been murdered.

After taking the precaution to protect Lucille&#x27;s bedroom from vampires, the girl is taken to the Balfour mansion. As Sir James is instructed to venture to the mansion, he encounters the Man in the Beaver Hat (revealed to be Burke) and is hypnotized into thinking it is five years
earlier. Within the mansion, the events leading up to Balfour&#x27;s death are recreated and re-enacted and all secretly watch as Sir James kills Roger Balfour and fakes his suicide so as to ultimately marry Balfour&#x27;s daughter Lucille, against the deceased&#x27;s will. Once apprehended, Burke lifts the trance and identifies Sir James as the killer.

==Production notes==

Lon Chaney&#x27;s makeup for the film included sharpened teeth and the hypnotic eye effect, achieved with special wire fittings which he wore like monocles. Based on surviving accounts, he purposefully gave the &quot;vampire&quot; character an absurd quality, because it was the film&#x27;s Scotland Yard detective character, also played by Chaney, in a disguise. Surviving stills show this was the only time Chaney used his famous makeup case as an on-screen prop.

The story was an original work by Tod Browning, with Waldemar Young, who had previously worked with Browning on &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; and &quot;The Unknown&quot;, as the scenario writer. Young was previously employed as a journalist in San Francisco, during which time he covered several famous murder investigations, a distinction which saw him lauded as knowing &quot;mystery from actual experience.&quot;

In adding an authenticity to both Chaney&#x27;s character and the atmosphere within the haunted house scenes, bats, armadillos, and owls were used.
When &quot;London After Midnight&quot; premiered at the Miller Theater in Missouri, set musicians Sam Feinburg and Jack Feinburg had to prepare melodies to go with the film&#x27;s supernatural elements. The musicians used &quot;Ase&#x27;s Todd&quot; and &quot;Eritoken&quot; by Greig, &quot;Dramatic Andante&quot; by Rappe, the &quot;Fire Music&quot; from Wagner&#x27;s &quot;The Valkyrie&quot; along with other unlisted aspects of Savino, Zimonek and Puccini.

==Reception==
According to MGM records &quot;London After Midnight&quot; earned $721,000 in theater rentals from the United States and Canada and an additional $283,000 from foreign rentals, giving the studio a profit of $540,000. It became the most successful collaborative film between Chaney and Browning, but it received mixed reviews from critics. The storyline, called &quot;somewhat incoherent&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;nonsensical&quot; by &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;, was a common point of criticism. &quot;Mr. Chaney&#x27;s makeup is at times hideous enough to make one sick in the stomach. It should please the morbid. Just like the last three or four pictures with this star – gruesome!&quot; Nonetheless, the commercial success of &quot;London After Midnight&quot; saw Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer renew Tod Browning&#x27;s directorial contract.
A positive review ran in &quot;The Film Daily&quot;, calling it &quot;a story certain to disturb the nervous system of the more sensitive picture patrons. Thrills and weird doings in profusion. Probably a trifle too spooky for the timid soul. If they don&#x27;t get the creeps from flashes of grimy bats swooping around, cobweb-bedecked mystery chambers and the grotesque inhabitants of the haunted house, then they&#x27;ve passed the third degree.&quot;

&quot;The Warren Tribune&quot; noted that Lon Chaney is &quot;present in nearly every scene, in a dual role that tests his skill to no small degree.&quot; The review highlighted that this subdues Chaney&#x27;s prominence and allows the plot to be better communicated, but it also causes the film to &quot;not rank among his best productions.&quot;

A review by &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; noted: &quot;It is pleasant to report also that there is none of the usual stupid comedy relief in &quot;London After Midnight&quot; to mar its sinister and creepy scheme. That ought to make it the outstanding mystery film of the year.&quot; It however found fault in Tod Browning&#x27;s direction because the film&#x27;s atmosphere did not recapture &quot;the intensely weird effect&quot; found in &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot;.
&quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;Young, Browning and Chaney have made a good combination in the past but the story on which this production is based is not of the quality that results in broken house records,&quot; adding that, since Burke was &quot;a detached character, mechanical and wooden&quot;, he failed to meaningfully connect with the audience... &quot;It will add nothing to Chaney&#x27;s prestige as a trouper, nor increase the star&#x27;s box office value. With Chaney&#x27;s name in lights, however, this picture, any picture with Chaney, means a strong box office draw.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It is a somewhat incoherent narrative, which, however, gives Lon Chaney an opportunity to turn up in an uncanny disguise and also to manifest his powers as Scotland Yard&#x27;s expert hypnotist. You are therefore treated to close-ups of Mr. Chaney&#x27;s rolling orbs, which, fortunately, do not exert their influence on the audience.&quot;

&quot;Moving Picture World&quot; added, &quot;There are moments during the onward sweep of this Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer offering when one feels that the essentials that make for mystery and creepiness have been carried a bit further than we have hitherto noted... Mr. Chaney&#x27;s excellent work is materially aided by that grand master of screen acting, Mr. Walthall.&quot;

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; also wrote that the &quot;directing, acting and settings are all well up to the idea,&quot; but &quot;it strives too hard to create effect. Mr. Browning can create pictorial terrors and Lon Chaney can get himself up in a completely repulsive manner, but both their efforts are wasted when the story makes no sense.&quot;

&quot;Motion Picture Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;Lon Chaney is back in a get-up which would make any sensitive girl quiver and quake on a dark night, but which doesn&#x27;t require any contortions or self-torture. This is a dark, foul mystery play, which has certain elements as horrid as anyone could ask... you sit through it in a sort of daze.&quot;

&quot;Photoplay&quot; enthused, &quot;The disguise that [Chaney] uses while ferreting out the murderer is as gruesome as any he has ever worn... The suspense is marvelously sustained. Chaney plays a dual role, and when conventionally clad, is a little less convincing than usual. In the other role, perfect!&quot;

==Preservation status==

The last known copy of the film was destroyed in the 1965 MGM vault fire, along with hundreds of other rare early films, making it one of the most sought-after lost silent films. Film historians William K. Everson and David Bradley claim they saw the film in the early 1950s, and an MGM vault inventory from 1955 shows the print being stored in Vault #7.

Historian Jon C. Mirsalis opined, &quot;Despite all the mythology and excitement over the film, all indications are that it would be a disappointment if uncovered today. Both Everson and Bradley admit that the film was inferior to &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot;. The critics of the time were likewise lukewarm, and even Chaney&#x27;s performance got less than the usual enthusiastic reviews. The eerie sets, and Chaney&#x27;s stunning vampire make-up, make for intriguing still photographs, but these scenes account for only a small portion of the film, the rest of the footage being devoted to Polly Moran&#x27;s comic relief, and talkie passages between detective Chaney and Walthall. Perhaps it is a film that is viewed with more reverence than it deserves simply because it is no longer available for study.&quot;

==Remake==
Tod Browning remade the film as a sound film in 1935. This film, called &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot;, starred Lionel Barrymore and Bela Lugosi in the roles Lon Chaney had performed in &quot;London After Midnight&quot;.

==Reconstructions and novelisations==
A novelization of the film was written and published in 1928 by Marie Coolidge-Rask.

In 1985, Philip J. Riley published the first photo reconstruction of the film&#x27;s plot compiled of all the surviving production stills at MGM.

In 2002, Turner Classic Movies commissioned restoration producer Rick Schmidlin to produce a 45-minute reconstruction of the film, using the same still photographs with added camera motion. This was released as a part of &quot;The Lon Chaney Collection&quot; DVD set released by the TCM Archives.

In 2016, Thomas Mann published the book, &quot;London After Midnight: A New Reconstruction Based on Contemporary Sources&quot;, upon the discovery of a previously-unknown 11,000-word &quot;Boy&#x27;s Cinema&quot; magazine published in 1928. A second edition was published in 2018 upon the discovery of an alternative French novelization for the film.

In 2022, a new study by historian Daniel Titley, titled &quot;London After Midnight: The Lost Film&quot;, was released in conjunction with the film’s 95th anniversary, in which nitrate elements from the lost film itself were presented for the first time, along with many other new insights published by Keyreads, and serving as the most milestone discovery of the film to date.

==Audio dramatization==
In September 2023, it was announced that a full-cast audio drama would be released, adapted from the original film script. The cast includes Art Malik as Detective Burke, and Dan Starkey as Sir James Hamlin. The production was released the following month through Bandcamp and as part of the fiction podcast Midnight Matinees. The audio drama received overwhelmingly positive reviews.

==Theatrical poster==
In 2014, the only contemporary poster known to exist for the film was sold in Dallas, Texas, to an anonymous bidder for $478,000, making it the most valuable movie poster ever sold at public auction. This bidder was later revealed to be Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett. The poster is in his displayed collection at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. (The 1932 film &quot;The Mummy&quot; held the previous record for a poster&#x27;s sale at public auction, selling for more than $453,000 in 1997.)

==In popular culture==
* Director Jennifer Kent has stated that images of Lon Chaney&#x27;s character inspired the look of the titular character in &quot;The Babadook&quot;.
* Episodes 5 and 6 of series 3 of &quot;Whitechapel&quot; featured a killer obsessed with &quot;London After Midnight&quot; who owned a surviving copy.
* The theatrical poster for the 2021 horror film &quot;The Black Phone&quot; has been compared to Chaney.
* KISS member Gene Simmons has said that the cape he wears as part of his Demon costume is based on Lon Chaney&#x27;s costume in this film.

<text>The ashy-headed laughingthrush (Argya cinereifrons) is a member of the family Leiothrichidae. The laughingthrushes are a large family of Old World passerine birds characterised by soft fluffy plumage. These are birds of tropical areas, with the greatest variety in southeast Asia.
==Taxonomy==
The ashy-headed laughingthrush was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Garrulax&quot; but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Argya&quot;.

==Description==
The ashy-headed laughingthrush is a rangy bird, 23 centimetre (9 in) in length with a long floppy tail. It is rufous brown above and deep buff below, with a grey head and white throat. Like other babblers, these are noisy birds, and the characteristic laughing calls are often the best indication that they are present, since they are often difficult to see in their preferred habitat.

==Distribution and habitat==
The ashy-headed laughingthrush is a resident breeding bird endemic to Sri Lanka. Its habitat is rainforest, and it is seldom seen away from deep jungle or dense bamboo thickets in the wet zone. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight.

Although its habitat is under threat, this laughingthrush occurs in all the forests of the wet zone, and is quite common at prime sites like Kitulgala and Sinharaja. It builds its nest in a bush, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is three or four eggs.

==Behaviour==
As with other babbler species, ashy-headed laughingthrushes frequently occur in groups of up to a dozen, and are also often found in the mixed feeding flocks typical of tropical Asian jungle. They feed mainly on insects, but also eat jungle berries.

==In culture==

In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;alu demalichcha&quot; (&quot;ash-babbler&quot;) in Sinhala language. The ashy-headed laughingthrush appears on a 3 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp.

<text>James Edward Keeler (September 10, 1857 – August 12, 1900) was an American astronomer. He was an early observer of galaxies using photography, as well as the first to show observationally that the rings of Saturn do not rotate as a solid body.

== Career and personal life ==

Keeler was born in La Salle Illinois, but grew up and spent the majority of his early life in Mayport, Florida near Jacksonville. His mother&#x27;s father was a former Governor of Connecticut, Henry Dutton.

Keeler worked at Lick Observatory beginning in 1888 but left after being appointed director of the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Allegheny Observatory in 1891. He returned to Lick Observatory as its director in 1898 but died not long after in 1900. Keeler suffered from a heart weakness that went undiagnosed until shortly before his death. On the 12th of August, he died from a sudden stroke. His ashes were interred in a crypt at the base of the 31-inch Keeler Memorial telescope at the Allegheny Observatory.

Along with George Hale, Keeler founded and edited the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;, which remains a major journal of astronomy today.

His parents were William F. and Anna (née Dutton) Keeler. He had married in 1891 and left a widow and two children.

== Research ==

Keeler was the first to observe the gap in Saturn&#x27;s rings now known as the Encke Gap, using the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory on 7 January 1888. After this feature had been named for Johann Encke, who had observed a much broader variation in the brightness of the A Ring, Keeler&#x27;s contributions were brought to light. The second major gap in the A Ring, discovered by &quot;Voyager&quot;, was named the Keeler Gap in his honor.

In 1895, his spectroscopic study of the rings of Saturn revealed that different parts of the rings reflect light with different Doppler shifts, due to their different rates of orbit around Saturn. This was the first observational confirmation of the theory of James Clerk Maxwell that the rings are made up of countless small objects, each orbiting Saturn at its own rate. These observations were made with a spectrograph attached to the 13-inch Fitz-Clark refracting telescope at Allegheny Observatory.

His observations with the Lick Crossley telescope helped establish the importance of large optical reflecting telescopes, and expanded astronomers&#x27; understanding of nebulae. After his untimely death, his colleagues at Lick Observatory arranged for the publication of his photographs of nebulae and clusters in a special volume of the Lick Observatory publications.

Keeler discovered two minor planets, the Koronis asteroid 452 Hamiltonia in 1899, and the Mars-crosser asteroid in 1900, which became a lost minor planet until its recovery 99 years later.

After the discovery of pulsars in 1967, optical images of the Crab Nebula taken by Keeler in 1899 were used to determine the proper motion of the Crab Pulsar.

== Honors and legacy ==

Keeler was awarded the Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1899. In 1900 he was elected president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

In 1880, Allegheny Observatory director Samuel Pierpont Langley, accompanied by Keeler and others, went on a scientific expedition to the summit of Mount Whitney. The purpose of the expedition was to study how the Sun&#x27;s radiation was selectively absorbed by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, comparing the results at high altitude with those found at lower levels. As a result of the expedition, a 14,240-ft. peak near Mount Whitney was named the &quot;Keeler Needle&quot;.

In addition to the Keeler gap in Saturn&#x27;s rings, the Martian crater &quot;Keeler&quot;, the lunar crater &quot;Keeler&quot;, as well as the asteroid 2261 Keeler, are named in his honor.

<text>This is a list of [[mayor]]s of [[Edmonton]], a city in Alberta, Canada.

Edmonton was incorporated as a town on January 9, 1892, with Matthew McCauley acclaimed as its first mayor during the town&#x27;s first election, held February 10, 1892. On October 8, 1904, Edmonton became a city during the tenure of Mayor William Short. Edmonton was part of the North-West Territories until September 1, 1905, when it became the capital of the newly created province of Alberta, during the tenure of Mayor Kenneth W. MacKenzie. The longest serving mayor is William Hawrelak, who was elected as mayor seven times, serving for a total of 10 years 4 months over three periods: four consecutive terms starting 1951, resigned in 1959 during last month of fourth term; two consecutive terms starting 1963, expelled by the courts in 1964; one term starting in 1974, died in office in 1975.

==Mayors of Edmonton==
* Terry Cavanagh was never elected to the mayor&#x27;s spot. Twice he sat in the mayor&#x27;s chair. He was interim or acting mayor after Hawrelak&#x27;s death and after Decore&#x27;s resignation.

<text>The tawny-bellied babbler (Dumetia hyperythra) also known in older Indian works as the rufous-bellied babbler is a small babbler that forages in small groups in low scrub forests. Like other members of the large Old World babbler family they are passerine birds characterised by soft fluffy plumage. There are three subspecies within the Indian Subcontinent. The nominate &quot;hyperythra&quot; found in northern and eastern India is uniformly brown underneath while &quot;albogularis&quot; of the western Indian peninsula is white throated. The population in Sri Lanka, &quot;phillipsi,&quot; is also white throated but is paler underneath and has a larger bill.

==Description==
The tawny-bellied babbler is a small babbler at 13 cm including its long round-tipped tail. The outer tail feathers are about half the length of the central tail feather. It is dark brown above and orange-buff below, with a rufous grey crown. The feathers on the forehead are stiff and the tail has cross rays and is otherwise olive brown. The throat is white in adults of the populations of peninsular India and Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan population, however, has a larger and heavier beak and paler underparts.

The population on Mt. Abu is white-throated with chestnut feathers on the crown (appearing capped, as opposed to the chestnut being only on the forehead) having pale shafts. It has been proposed as a subspecies &quot;abuensis&quot; but is more often included in &quot;albogularis&quot;. Another variant form first described from Khandala Ghats as &quot;navarroi&quot; is also usually included within the range of &quot;albogularis&quot;.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The species was first described by James Franklin in 1831, placed in the genus &quot;Timalia.&quot; The genus &quot;Dumetia&quot; was established by Blyth in 1852 who saw differences between it and other genera. The genus characters were in the distribution of the stiff feathers on the forehead and the shape of the bill. Modern classifications based on DNA sequences note that the species is a sister of the dark-fronted babbler and the chestnut-capped babbler. It is part of the subfamily Timaliinae.

==Distribution and habitat==

The tawny-bellied babbler is found from Nepal and north-central India to Sri Lanka. The populations in India are all intergrading and no disjunct distributions exist. Its natural habitat is scrub and tall grassland. In Sri Lanka it is found in the hills up to about 1500 m above sea level.

==Behaviour==
The tawny-bellied babbler builds its nest in a low bush, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The nest is a ball of long woven leaves of bamboo or grasses. They breed from May to September mostly during the rains. The normal clutch is three or four eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs. In Sri Lanka they are thought to raise more than one brood. Like most babblers, it is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. A prenuptial moult takes place in January–February in the southern population. It feeds mainly on insects but also takes nectar from flowers of &quot;Bombax&quot; and &quot;Erythrina&quot;. They produce cheeping, twittering or harsh chattering notes while foraging in bushes. The name &quot;Pandi Jitta&quot;, literally &quot;pig bird&quot; in Telugu, refers to its habit of foraging under dense shrubbery in the manner of pigs.

Banded bay cuckoos have been known to lay their eggs in the nests of tawny-bellied babblers. Unidentified haematozoa placed in the genus &quot;Leucocytozoon&quot; have been recorded from the blood of the species. A specimen that died in captivity was found to have microfilariae in addition to haematozoa.

<doc id="628160" wikidata="Q220701" url="?curid=628160" title="Yonaguni">
<text>, one of the Yaeyama Islands, is the westernmost island of Japan, lying from the east coast of Taiwan, between the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea. The island is administered as the town of Yonaguni, Yaeyama Gun, Okinawa, and there are three settlements: Sonai, Kubura, and Higawa. There have been discussions to establish direct ferry services with Taiwan in order to bolster tourism.

==Name==
The name &quot;Yonaguni&quot; is an exonym related to the native name &quot;Dunan&quot; in Yonaguni, with the regular sound change of &quot;*y-&quot; to &quot;d-&quot; and elision of the intervocalic &quot;*-g-&quot; in Yonaguni. The form &quot;yona-&quot; likely means &quot;grain, rice&quot;, seen in other toponyms such as Yonabaru, hence possibly meaning &quot;grain country&quot;.

==History==
Early human migration from Taiwan to Yonaguni island has long been the subject of scholarly debate. In 2019, a team of Japanese and Taiwanese researchers succeeded in completing the two-day journey from Cape Wushibi in Taitung County to Yonaguni island along the Kuroshio current in a dugout canoe based on technology and materials from 30,000 years ago. Otherwise, the early history of Yonaguni remains vague. The first written record that ever mentions the island is a 1477 Korean document (&quot;Chosen Hyōryūmin no Yaeyama kenbunroku&quot;), an account of several fishermen from the current Jeju Province who drifted there.

A legendary female leader, , is said to have been the ruler of Yonaguni at around the end of the fifteenth century. She is described as possessing superhuman powers that allowed her to protect her people from foreign attacks multiple times, including when Yonaguni was attacked by Miyako, a nearby island. Rituals are still held once a year to worship this mythical figure.

In the 15th century, the island was incorporated into the Ryūkyū Kingdom. By 1879, the island was formally annexed by imperial Japan.

Until the early 20th century, Yonaguni was part of the larger Yaeyama Magiri (village after 1907), which included the neighboring Yaeyama Islands. In 1948, it became an independent village. From 1945 to 1972, it was occupied by the United States and was then returned to Japan to form a part of Okinawa Prefecture.
As a result of increased tensions between Japan, China, and Taiwan over the disputed sovereignty of the Japanese-controlled uninhabited Senkaku/Diaoyu/Tiaoyutai Islands which are located roughly 80 nautical miles north-northeast of Yonaguni Island, Japan began construction in 2014 of a coastal monitoring / early warning station with radar and other sensors on Yonaguni to counter a perceived threat from Chinese forces. The initial planned complement of 150 troops include personnel stationed at a garrison located on the outskirts of Yonaguni town. The station&#x27;s radar became active on 28 March 2016. Separately, a joint (GSDF / ASDF) &quot;mobile aircraft control &amp; warning squadron&quot; is planned to be formed and co-located at the station. 

In 2024, the Japanese army deployed seven surface-to-surface missile companies, covering Miyako-jima city, Ishigaki city, and Amami Ōshima Island. Additionally, an electronic warfare unit was deployed from Kumamoto Prefecture to Yonaguni &quot;to jam or interfere with hostile forces&#x27; signals and radar stations&quot;.

Given Yonaguni&#x27;s geographic proximity to Taiwan (only 110 km east of Yilan), there have been discussions to develop tourism in Yonaguni via a regular, direct ferry service from Taiwan&#x27;s Yilan County (Suao Township) for both Taiwanese and Japanese tourists. In July 2023, Taiwan&#x27;s Legislative Speaker, You Si-kun, led a trial ferry service from Suao to Yonaguni. The trip took around two hours each way. It was said that if a regular ferry service was established, it would attract Taiwanese tourists to Yonaguni Island, which has a population of just 1,700, and Japanese visitors to Yilan. It was expressed that the friendship between Japan and Taiwan can also be deepened through such ties. However, due to Yonaguni&#x27;s lack of infrastructure and tourism resources (such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation), challenges remain to promote tourism.

==Mythical and cultural references==
As the westernmost inhabited island of Japan, Yonaguni has also been constantly associated with the myth of &quot;the island of women&quot; (&quot;Nyōgo no Shima&quot;) since the Edo period. As suggested by the name, &quot;the island of women&quot; is an island where there are only women born and living to support each other. Being a trope frequently used in Edo literary works, it not only appears at the end of &quot;The Life of an Amorous Man&quot; (好色一代男 &quot;Kōshoku Ichidai Otoko&quot;, 1682), but also dominates the second part of the five-section &quot;Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon&quot; (椿説弓張月 &quot;Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki&quot;, 1807–1811). While the whole second part of the story is about the protagonist Tametomo&#x27;s time spent on &quot;the island of women&quot;, which is the westernmost island of Japan according to the tale, the map provided at the beginning of the third section clearly marks the island as &#x27;Yonaguni&#x27;, assuming the association between the mythical women island and Yonaguni.

During the Taisho period, the Yaeyama islands including Yonaguni gradually came to be explored by people traveling from Japan, as there were &quot;ships from Osaka to Yonaguni once a year&quot; that introduced outsiders to the islands, who brought their knowledge about Yonaguni back to Japan through many ways, such as writing.

Out of all these early records about Yonaguni, one of the earliest and most influential writings was &quot;An expedition to the Southern Islands&quot; (&quot;Nantō tanken&quot;) by Sasamori Gisuke. In Sasamori&#x27;s research of Yonaguni, the island was notable due to its women: &quot;Women on the island have white skin, and are attentive and thoughtful. It takes only a few pennies for someone who enjoys accompaniment of beautiful women to have one of them in attendance during his stay provide drinks and serve him all night.&quot; The statement was confirmed by a later published collection of essays. A folk culture scholar, Motoyama Keisen, asserts that &quot;Yonaguni is the island of women&quot;, and continues to quote and agree with Sasamori&#x27;s account of Yonaguni women, saying that &quot;Surely this was true in 1893, when the author went on his expedition there.&quot;

However, a counter-statement is found in a collection of some comical essays by a Taishō novelist and script writer, Murakami Namiroku, in his &quot;Collection of Satire Essays&quot; (&quot;Hiniku Bunshu&quot;), and gives a more detailed view of the circumstances of Yonaguni women. One of the essays is titled &quot;Yonaguni&quot; and focuses on the same topic, claiming that &quot;once a man steps on the island, no matter how strong he is, the man would be attacked by women coming from all directions, and hardly ever there could be men who could safely withdraw from there&quot;. Furthermore, he describes Yonaguni as an island where, although there are almost only women, for reproductive purposes, there are also a few men: as many as around one-tenth of the women. Curiously, there are only female newborns. Serving as reproductive tools for the women, men are rarely able to live long. Murakami expresses his worries as well at the end, as the women here are all naturally beautiful and potentially they would attract those driven by sexual desire to explore &quot;the hidden paradise&quot;.

Nevertheless, these introductory essays aiming to bring an exotic taste are less specific than a quite comprehensive travel log by Yanagita Kunio, who was inspired by Sasamori&#x27;s work and finally did his own research, &quot;An Account of the South Sea&quot; (&quot;Kainan shōki)&quot;, published in 1925. A long essay from the collection is titled and devoted to &quot;Yonaguni Women&quot;. He provides a detailed written record of their customs and daily life, and writes about how they are busy farming, cooking, and taking care of children, with two photographs attached, wearing clothes not so much different from the rest of Japan.

Yonaguni islanders traditionally believed that their island had once been ruled by a goddess named Miruku, who brought fertility to the land. She was ousted by a god named Saku after a flower-growing contest for control over the island, in which Saku stole her flower while she slept. Miruku vanished, and the island&#x27;s primeval prosperity sank into poverty once she left. The islanders thus held rituals in honor of the goddess in the hope that she might one day return. As late as the 1980s, the highlight of the Yonaguni harvest festival was a procession involving a person in a Miruku mask reenacting the goddess. A nearly identical myth is widespread in Korea.

==Geography==

The island has an area of and a population of around 1,700.

Yonaguni, more specifically Cape Irizaki () at the western tip of the island, is the westernmost point of Japan. The island is situated in the middle of the Yonaguni Depression, a relatively deep gap in the Ryukyu arc, where the warm Kuroshio Current enters the East China Sea from the Philippine Sea.

According to Japanese anthropologist , the island of Yonaguni can be seen with the naked eye from Taroko Mountain in Taiwan under good weather conditions.

===Climate===
Yonaguni has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;). The average yearly temperature is , and the average monthly temperature ranges from in January to in July. September is the wettest month while July is the driest.

==Main sights==
Yonaguni is known in Japan for the &quot;hanazake&quot;, a 120-proof rice-based distilled beverage (&quot;awamori&quot;) produced only on the island.

The island is also the only natural habitat of a distinctive horse breed, the Yonaguni horse.

Yonaguni&#x27;s densely forested areas provide a suitable habitat for the Ryukyu atlas moth &quot;(A. a. ryukyuensis)&quot;.

Yonaguni is a destination for divers because of the large numbers of hammerhead sharks that gather in the surrounding waters during winter.

===Yonaguni Monument===

In 1986, local divers discovered a striking underwater rock formation off the southernmost point of the island. The formation, known popularly as the Yonaguni Monument, has staircase-like terraces with flat sides and sharp corners. Masaaki Kimura, a professor from Okinawa, believes it is an artificial (or artificially modified) structure; however, the majority of academic society regard the rock formation as a natural geologic structure.

===Irizaki===
Cape Irizaki is the westernmost point of Japan and the place to see the final sunset in Japan.

===Agarizaki===
Cape Agarizaki is the easternmost cape of Yonaguni. Tourists come here to view the sunrise and to observe scenic views of the ocean at the cape. Other attractions include the lighthouse and Yonaguni horse.

===Southeast coast===
* Gunkan-iwa is a rock formation near the shore that looks like a battleship
* Tachigami-iwa (Tatigami-iwa) is a single big rock outstanding offshore
* Sanninudai is a place with step-like slate rock terraces, and offers a viewing point for Gunkan-iwa
* Jinmen-iwa is a big rock in the forest that resembles a human face

<text>The University of Santiago, Chile (Usach) () is one of the oldest public universities in Chile. The institution was born as &quot;Escuela de Artes y Oficios&quot; (Spanish: &quot;School of Arts and Careers&quot;) in 1849 by Ignacy Domeyko, under the government of Manuel Bulnes. It became &quot;Universidad Técnica del Estado&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Technical University of the State&quot;) in 1947, with various campuses throughout the country. In 1981, as a consequence of a reform on higher education under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, it became what is now known as &quot;Universidad de Santiago de Chile&quot;, with all activities centered in a single 340,000 m2 campus in the capital Santiago.

==History==

The University of Santiago of Chile (USACH) started as the School of Arts and Crafts in 1849. It was born in the mid-20th century and it is the fifth oldest university in Chile.

===Escuela de Artes y Oficios===

The Escuela de Artes y Oficios (EAO)(Spanish &quot;School of Arts and Crafts&quot;) was founded on July 6, 1849 by Ignacy Domeyko, during the Manuel Bulnes Prieto rule, to improve scientific and technical development in the country. It started with four workshops: Mining, Mechanics, Casting and Carpentry. 
At the time, students ages ranged between 15 and 18 years old, thus making the EAO not a University, but a secondary education entity. Students were required to read and write and to know basic arithmetic operations. Besides being intensely trained in workshops, students studied algebra, descriptive geometry, trigonometry, technical drawing, industrial mechanics, physics and chemistry, besides Spanish, history and geography. This was a four-year education that later, in 1858, extended to five years. Graduates were called &#x27;apprentices&#x27;.

In 1886 the EAO moved to a bigger building, located at Quinta Normal, where it would stay up until now. In 1912 it started to educate &#x27;industrial sub-engineers&#x27;, later known as &#x27;technicians&#x27;. By the time, the EAO was able to grant two education level degrees: Arts and Crafts degrees (secondary education level) and Technician degrees (tertiary education level), and by 1936 it granted Industrial Engineering degrees too.

===Universidad Técnica del Estado===
Later during the presidency of Gabriel González Videla through the DFL Decree No. 1831 of April 9, 1947, the School of Arts and Crafts was joined with the School of Mining in Copiapó (1857), La Serena (1887) and Antofagasta (1918), with the Industrial Design Schools (1905) in Temuco (1916) and Valdivia (1934), with the Industrial Engineering Schools in Santiago (1940) and with the Technical Pedagogy Institute. Together these formed the Technical State University (&quot;Universidad Técnica del Estado&quot;, UTE), resulting in it becoming the best Chilean university in the area of applied engineering and industrial technician training. 
On February 8, 1952, the first statute that allowed the grouping to begin functioning as a university in legal, administrative and academic terms, was enacted. Its first president was Don Octavio Valenzuela Lazo (March 12, 1952 to March 12, 1953). 
In 1958, the Teknos, the university&#x27;s troupe, was founded.
Academic activity remained in the hands of the four Faculty Councils under the tuition of the University Council. During the 1960s, the DFL No. 2, 1971, allowed for the enacting of a second organizational statute, which allowed the University to be organized through offices, colleges, departments, and all academic structures that the board would deem appropriate.

In 1968 due to the University Reform of 1967–1973, Enrique Kirberg Baltiansky assumed the rectory, the only university rector fully elected by faculty and students.

In 1971, during the government of Salvador Allende, Revised Statutes of the &quot;Universidad Técnica del Estado&quot; were approved. 
During the 1973 coup, Kirberg was removed from his post and imprisoned by the military regime, the statute previously approved was declared void, and new guidelines were reformulated with appointments done entirely by the military regime.

The musician and poet Víctor Jara, who worked as a professor at the university, was arrested by Pinochet&#x27;s forces, tortured and murdered days later

===Universidad de Santiago de Chile===
In 1981, the military regime through the DFL Decree No. 23 of March 21, 1981, divided the headquarters of the State Technical University, giving rise to new universities and professional institutes. Steps were taken to form the headquarters into the University of Santiago de Chile. The other sites became separately named universities such as the University of Atacama, the University of Antofagasta, the University of Serena, the Professional Institute of Talca (later transformed into the University of Talca), the University of the Bío-Bío, the University of La Frontera, the Professional Institute of Osorno (subsequently transformed into the University of Los Lagos), the Professional Institute of Valdivia (later integrated in 1988 into the Southern University of Chile) and the Magellan Professional Institute (later transformed into the University of Magallanes). The University of Santiago de Chile, near the University of Atacama and the University of Magallanes are the only heirs of the traditional State Technical University, because at the time of the dissolution and the creation of the new universities in 1981, the headquarters (Santiago), Copiapó and Punta Arenas, were not integrated with other university offices. The headquarters is located where the old School of Arts and Crafts used to be in the municipality of Estación Central. One of its symbols is the planetarium built in the 1980s.

==Departments==
The university houses over 18,000 undergraduate students in 66 different majors, in the following departments:

*Engineering (&quot;Ingeniería&quot;),
*Bachelors Program in Arts and Sciences (&quot;Bachillerato&quot;),
*Business Administration &amp; Economics (&quot;Administración y Economía&quot;),
*Chemistry &amp; Biology (&quot;Química y Biología&quot;),
*Medical Sciences (&quot;Ciencias Médicas&quot;),
*Sciences (&quot;Ciencias&quot;),
*Humanities (&quot;Humanidades&quot;),
*School of Architecture (&quot;Escuela de Arquitectura&quot;), and
*Technology Department (&quot;Facultad Tecnológica&quot;).

== Independent Organizations ==
=== Feusach ===
The University of Santiago Students Federation (Feusach) is an organization that represents and aims to protect all the students enrolled at University of Santiago in matters relating to the higher education system, i.e. decisions and actions of university, academic and political officials dealing with the public service of the higher education given by the university. It also works as a union bond between the huge number of students and authorities of the university in order to promote the mutual collaboration for the university management, and also seeks to promote the harmonious development of students at the large university campus thus generating and establishing an important space for politics and university management in the country.

=== Afusach ===
The association of servants of the University of Santiago, Chile is an association formed by servants representatives who work for the university. This association, as a union, acts to represent and protect the collective interests of workers before the action of the university officials, and in general before the State political decisions regarding human resources management and civil service. As an association it is ruled by the Administrative Statute and by extract, it is ruled by the Labour Code.

=== University of Santiago Planetarium ===
Planetario Chile is located at the University Campus; it is 13380 m2, made up of a building, square, gardens, water mirror and parking for 100 cars. Single in its kind in the country, it&#x27;s one of the biggest 50 astronomical audiovisual centres in the world. The astronomical dome is 22 m diameter and the stars simulation equipment, a Carl Zeiss projector, model VI, and allows observing the southern and northern night sky.

== Communication Media ==
=== University of Santiago, Chile Radio and Television (1959 to present) ===
In 1959, the Universidad Técnica del Estado radio was launched, local radio station with subsidiaries in towns where UTE was present. After the arrival of television and the cinema development in Chile during the 1960, UTE founded the Cinema and Television Department. During these years, this department develops a series of documentaries that showed the work of the institution in that time.

In 1971, the UTE cinema department released its first production “El Sueldo de Chile” (1971) directed by Fernando Balmaceda. By then, the Universidad Técnica del Estado was planning to open a television signal in Channel 11, whose intentions were finally aborted after the coup d&#x27;état in 1973. In 1979, 11 VHF dial of Santiago, Chile was transferred to the known as Universidad de Chile Television, today known as Chilevision.

Due to the university reform in 1981, Universidad Técnica del Estado Radio and its subsidiaries in the country broke up and were replaced by Universidad de Santiago Radio, Universidad de Talca Radio, Universidad del Bio-Bio Radio, Universidad de Atacama Radio, Universidad de Antofagasta Radio, Universidad de La Serena Radio, Universidad de los Lagos Radio, Universidad de Magallanes Radio and Universidad de la Frontera Radio. Universidad de Santiago de Chile Radio assumed the legal continuity of the preceding.

In 1998, students from the informatics career of the aforementioned university led by José Zorrilla, developed a project to transmit the radio via internet and a program transmission system on demand, whose technology would be known six years later as podcasting. At the same time, its web site is launched leading it as the first university radio transmitting via internet with a unique podcasting system in the world.

University of Santiago, Chile radio as well as television contributes to spread local music via cultural programs and hot news such as Escena Viva. Both have their own channel in YouTube. In 2018 the university launched a television channel via signal 48.1 for an on-line open digital television in Santiago, called Santiago Televisión, broadcasting 24 hours.

=== U. de Santiago al Día ===
The university also has a daily newsletter known as &quot;U. de Santiago al Día&quot; that tells about the university events and university scientific news in the field of humanities, sciences and technology.

== Rankings and accreditation ==
It is currently accredited by the National Accreditation Commission (CNA-Chile) for a period of 7 years (out of a maximum of 7), from February 2021 to February 2028, being one of the 5 universities with maximum accreditation in the country.

The university ranks fourth among Chilean universities according to the CSIC webometric ranking (July 2020). In 2017, Times Higher Education ranked the university within the 401-500 band globally.

According to the QS World University Rankings 2022, the University of Santiago ranked third among Chilean universities and as the second best public higher education institution in the country.

In the QS Latin America University Ranking 2023, the university ranked 4th among Chilean universities and 14th in Latin America.

<text>The University of Memphis (Memphis) is a public research university in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. Founded in 1912, the university has an enrollment of more than 20,000 students.

The university maintains the Herff College of Engineering, the Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI), the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law, the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, the former Lambuth University campus in Jackson, Tennessee (now a branch campus of the University of Memphis), the Loewenberg College of Nursing, the School of Public Health, the College of Communication and Fine Arts, the FedEx Institute of Technology, the Advanced Distributed Learning Workforce Co-Lab, and the Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology. The University of Memphis is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High research activity&quot;.

==History==

In 1909, the Tennessee Legislature enacted the General Education Bill. This bill stated that three colleges be established, one within each grand division of the state and one additional school for African-American students. After much bidding and campaigning, the state had to choose between two sites to build the new college for West Tennessee: Jackson and Memphis. Memphis was chosen, one of the main reasons being the proximity of the rail line to the site proposed to build the new college for West Tennessee. This would allow professors and students to go home and visit their relatives. The other three schools established through the General Education Act evolved into East Tennessee State University (ETSU), Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), and Tennessee State University (TSU).

Prior to the establishment of the West Tennessee State Normal School pursuant to the General Education Bill, a number of higher education departments existed in Memphis under the banner of the &quot;University of Memphis.&quot; This earlier University of Memphis was formed in 1909 by adding to an already existing medical school&#x27;s departments of pharmacy, dentistry, and law.

On September 10, 1912, West Tennessee State Normal School opened in Memphis; its first president was Seymour A. Mynders. By 1913 all departments of the earlier &quot;University of Memphis,&quot; except the law school, had been taken over by West Tennessee State Normal School. After Mynders&#x27; death in 1913, John Willard Brister was chosen to take his place. After Brister&#x27;s resignation in 1918, Andrew A. Kincannon became president. In 1924, Brister returned to his post as president of the school.

The name changed in 1925 to West Tennessee State Teachers College. In 1931, the campus&#x27; first newspaper, &quot;The Tiger Rag&quot;, was established. In 1939, Richard C. Jones became president of WTSTC. In 1941, the name was changed to Memphis State College, when the college expanded its liberal arts curriculum. In 1943, Dr. Jennings B. Sanders succeeded Jones as president. Three years later, the first alumnus to become president, J. Millard (Jack) Smith, was appointed. In 1951 MSC awarded its first B.A. degree. In 1957 the school received full University status and changed its name accordingly to Memphis State University.
In 1959, five years after &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, holding that racial segregation in public education was unconstitutional, the university admitted its first black students. Racial segregation was the norm throughout the South at the time. The Memphis State Eight, as they were known, were admitted to Memphis State University. Their presence on campus was the focus not only of intense media scrutiny but severe criticism from much of the local public. Ostensibly for the black students&#x27; safety and to maintain an air of calm on the campus, university administrators placed certain stringent restrictions on where and when the black students could be on campus. They were to go only to their classes, not to any of the public places on campus, such as the cafeteria; and they were to leave the campus immediately after they had finished their last class. These limitations were lifted after the novelty of their presence on campus had subsided and the public&#x27;s focus on their presence there had lessened, and as more and more black students were admitted to the university, all such social restrictions were dropped. Today, black students make up more than one-third of the campus student body and participate in all campus activities.

Cecil C. Humphreys became president of MSU, succeeding Smith, in 1960. In 1966, the school began awarding doctoral degrees. Humphreys resigned as MSU president to become the first chancellor of the newly formed State University and Community College System, later renamed the Tennessee Board of Regents. John Richardson was appointed interim president.

In 1973, Dr. Billy Mac Jones became president. Also that year, the Memphis State Tigers men&#x27;s basketball team reached the finals of the NCAA tournament, only to fall at the hands of a UCLA team led by future NBA superstar and Basketball Hall of Famer Bill Walton in the NCAA Basketball Championship Game in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1980, Thomas Carpenter became president of MSU; he was succeeded by V. Lane Rawlins in 1991. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University changed its name again, to the current University of Memphis.

V. Lane Rawlins served from 1991 to 2000; Dr. Ralph Faudree filled in as interim president for one year after V. Lane Rawlins&#x27; departure. In 2001, The U of M installed its first female president, Shirley Raines, who retired in the summer of 2013. During her tenure (in 2008), the Tigers men&#x27;s basketball team again reached the NCAA Finals, only to later have the appearance vacated after an NCAA investigation. After a yearlong search, Dr. M. David Rudd was confirmed as the 12th president on May 1, 2014.

In the spring semester of 2020, the university joined thousands of other institutions and made a mid-semester shift to online classes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also introduced a credit/no credit grade option in lieu of the traditional grading scale for that semester.

==Campus==
The University of Memphis campus is located approximately east of downtown in the University District neighborhood of east Memphis. It has an area of , although this figure does not include the law school in the former United States federal customshouse in downtown Memphis, which opened in January 2010. The historic core of campus encompasses approximately .
Campus planners have significantly increased the amount of green space and the number of walkways over the past several years while maintaining the original historic architecture of the campus.

Surrounding the university&#x27;s main campus are several historic neighborhoods to the north and east, as well as the University District neighborhood and the commercial Highland Strip to the west. Many University of Memphis college students also reside in housing south of the main campus.

===Layout===
The University of Memphis campus is set out in a rectilinear format, planned as a geometric design similar to the Jeffersonian style of the University of Virginia.

Despite the gradual expansion of the campus to the West and South, the campus is fairly compact and retains a park-like, tree-lined setting. The farthest distance on campus takes about twenty-five minutes to walk. According to the most recent master plan, the University of Memphis is projected to expand and redevelop additional areas one block west of the main campus&#x27; current western boundary of Patterson St., making Highland Avenue the &quot;de facto&quot; entrance to the university.

===Main Campus===
The center of the main campus comprises buildings that made up the original campus. The first college buildings, including Scates Hall, Manning Hall, Mynders Hall, and Administration Building, were erected in the early 20th century. This section stretches from Patterson St. south to the end of the main campus at Walker Ave., with most buildings surrounding Alumni Mall and Student Plaza. The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments, as well as those of the Physics and Astronomy departments of the College of Arts and Sciences, are located in the original areas of campus.

Flanking the original area of campus to the east are the areas of major research for The Life Sciences and Engineering departments, including J.M. Smith Hall, Life Sciences Building and Herff College of Engineering Complex, as well as the College of Education, residing in E.C. Ball Hall, and the Art Museum of the University of Memphis, located in the Communication and Fine Arts Building. The Ned R. McWherter Library, a state-of-the-art library facility and one of the premier research libraries of the Mid-South United States, takes up the eastern part of the campus adjacent to Dunavant Plaza and Emeriti Grove.
The northwestern area of the main campus includes The Fogelman College of Business and Economics, The Fogelman Executive Center (a major conference center for regional executives visiting The University of Memphis that is now mainly occupied by the University Middle School, with plans to incorporate a predecessor to a High School education completing the long dreamt of k-college experience), and The FedEx Institute of Technology, a major research contributor in the areas of Supply Chain Management, Nanotechnology, Robotics and Intelligent Systems. Originally, at the north end of the campus, Norriswood Avenue formed the northern boundary. The campus expanded into this residential area in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The western edge and southwest corner include Johnson Hall (comprising the Geography and Geology Departments), Patterson Hall (housing the English department), John S. Wilder Tower (formerly Brister Tower), Greek Row, and the bulk of The University of Memphis residence halls. As The University of Memphis presses ahead with its planned expansion, many more facilities, pedestrian access, and green space will also be created with the renovation and development of the current residential block west of Patterson St. in the University District neighborhood.

On January 29, 2013, Governor Bill Haslam announced a $44.6 million state budget pledge for the Community Health Building, which is the new home of The Loewenberg College of Nursing and The School of Communication Sciences and Disorders. The University of Memphis was required to raise $15 million from private funds to match the state funds.

In 2017, the university announced plans for a new Veterans Care Center on campus. Located in the Psychological Services Center on campus, the Veterans Care Center &quot;will address the mental health needs of veterans, regardless of era, gender, discharge status or service connection.&quot;

In 2019, the university opened the Hunter Harrison Memorial Bridge, providing for the first time in school history a pedestrian crossing that connects the main campus and the campus areas south of the Norfolk-Southern railroad with uninterrupted access. This bridge connects to the new Southern Parking Garage, as well as the new $30 million Student Recreation &amp; Fitness Center completed in 2021, expanding the area of the campus south of the railroad tracks. The university completed construction in November 2022 of the new $44 million Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music building on Central Ave., beginning a major northward expansion of campus across Central Ave.

===Park Avenue Campus===
Directly south of the main campus along the corner of Park Avenue and Getwell Road sits the Park Avenue Campus, formerly known as South Campus. The Park Avenue Campus was formerly the site of Kennedy Veterans Hospital from 1942 until 1967 when the U.S. Government donated the land and buildings to the university. Very few buildings from the Kennedy Hospital days remain on campus. The Park Avenue Campus is home not only to various intramural athletics programs and facilities, but also to various research facilities, classrooms and the Community Health Building, which houses the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, the Memphis Speech and Hearing Center, and the Loewenberg College of Nursing. The Defense Contract Audit Agency formerly operated its main training facility on the Park Avenue Campus from 1982 to the early 2010s. WKNO formerly operated its FM and television stations on the Park Avenue Campus as well.

Future plans include a regulation indoor soccer stadium and track facility, capable of hosting large-scale NCAA Division I track-and-field meets.

The graduate and family housing units are located at Park Avenue, from the main university campus. The complex has 150 housing units. Residents are zoned to Memphis City Schools. The zoned schools are Sherwood Elementary School, Colonial Middle School, and White Station High School.

===Downtown Law School Campus===
In 2006, plans were announced that the University of Memphis, School of Law would relocate to the former U.S. Post Office &amp; Customs House in downtown Memphis. This facility pre-dates the existence of the university itself, having been constructed in multiple sections between 1885 and the early 1920s. In 2010, the law school was moved permanently from the main campus to the newly renovated downtown campus. The new University of Memphis, School of Law campus sits adjacent to downtown courts and the financial and administrative center of the city. It has been ranked multiple times among the top law school facilities in the U.S.

===Lambuth Campus===
In 2011, the University of Memphis began offering undergraduate and graduate programs on the former Lambuth University campus in Jackson, Tennessee, located approximately east of Memphis. Now known as the &quot;University of Memphis Lambuth Campus&quot;, the historic campus includes classroom buildings, dormitories, a library, a planetarium, and athletic facilities. Enrollment in the fall of 2011 stood at 246 students. Enrollment in the spring of 2018 was the first time enrollment surpassed 1,000 students, with a total of 1,038 students. The 2019–2020 term was the first term, to begin with an enrollment of over 1,000 students for the campus, with an official enrollment of 1,070 students. In the fall of 2020, enrollment had risen to 1,285 students.

===Environmentalism===
The Edward J. Meeman Biological Station of the University of Memphis conducts research in ecology, environmental biology, and natural history. It is named for Edward J. Meeman, an editor of the former &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot; newspaper who later established a foundation to fund environmental studies.

In 2007, President Shirley Raines signed the American College and University President&#x27;s Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), which requires that the university become carbon neutral.

The Green Campus Initiative works to develop and implement a strategic plan to achieve the goals of the APUPCC. Successful events and projects include the May 2009 2nd Annual E-Recycling Day, resulting in 155 tons of electronic items collected, and the Tiger Initiative for Gardening in Urban Settings (TIGUrS), a fruit and vegetable gardening initiative across campus.

In April 2008, the student-run Environmental Action Club ran a Green Power Campaign to promote a student referendum to add a &quot;Green Fee&quot; to tuition payments to fund clean, renewable energy and other campus sustainability projects. The referendum passed with a 69% student approval rate. The university is now purchasing renewable energy through the TVA&#x27;s Green Power Switch program and offsetting 10% of current energy use. It is now the 2nd largest green power purchaser in the entire TVA distribution region.

In February 2009, the TERRA (Technologically and Environmentally Responsive Residential Architecture) sustainable design demonstration house was completed. Designed by the Department of Architecture, the LEED Platinum TERRA house serves as a studio for which architecture and design students to design &quot;green&quot; housing within urban areas, as well as serve as a demonstration house open for tours and serving as an educational tool for the community.

Memphis received a grade of &quot;C&quot; on the 2009 Campus Sustainability Report Card published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Only 34 schools earned a higher grade.

===Student organizations===
There are hundreds of student organizations on the University of Memphis campus.

===Student newspaper===
&quot;The Daily Helmsman&quot; is the student newspaper of the University of Memphis. The publication is part of a tradition which began in 1931 as &quot;The Tiger Rag&quot;, a protest newspaper. Since that time, the newspaper has been continuously published by University of Memphis students. Even during World War II when paper and other resources were scarce, the newspaper was published as a newsletter and posted on bulletin boards around campus.

The name of the newspaper was changed to &quot;The Helmsman&quot; in 1972 and became &quot;The Daily Helmsman&quot; in 1981 when the newspaper began publishing four days a week. In 2021, the paper moved to weekly publication.

&quot;The Helmsman&quot; has won many honors over the years for reporting, photography and design, including awards given by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, Columbia University and the Southeastern Journalism Conference. &quot;Helmsman&quot; alumni have gone on to jobs at many prestigious news organizations, such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone magazine&quot;, and &quot;Southern Living&quot; magazine, among others. In 2012, &quot;The Helmsman&quot; and then-Editor-in-Chief Chelsea Boozer were awarded the College Press Freedom Award for their efforts fighting &quot;a retaliatory budget cut while enduring a campaign of harassment by campus police.&quot; The award is given annually by the Student Press Law Center and the Associated Collegiate Press. Boozer also won a national Investigative Reporters and Editors award for coverage of how student activity fees are spent, including how the Student Government Association writes its senior officers&#x27; free tuition, parking and stipends out of the money collected from the student body.

=== Religious organizations ===
Numerous religious centers are located on the campus, including the Wesley Foundation (a United Methodist student center), the Baptist Collegiate Ministry, the university Catholic Center and Catholic Student Center, Ukirk (a PCUSA campus ministry) Barth House Episcopal Student Center, Reformed University Fellowship, the Soma Christian Student Center (a Church of Christ-supported center), Memphis , and the Muslim Students Association. Numerous other religious clubs of various faiths also exist on campus, which meets in various locations.

===Honor societies===
There are 11 honor societies on campus.

===Greek life===
About six percent of undergraduate men and eight percent of undergraduate women are active in Memphis&#x27; Greek system. There are over 20 social Greek letter organizations on campus. However, since the late nineties, Greek campus participation has been decimated due to social issues.

==Traditions==
The University of Memphis has accumulated numerous traditions over its long history within the Tennessee Board of Regents system.

===Mighty Sound of the South===
The Mighty Sound of the South Band is the university&#x27;s band. The band performs at Memphis Tigers football games as a marching band and at Tigers basketball games as a pep band. As one of the oldest institutions at the university, the Band partakes in many of the game day traditions. The MSS performs more than any other student ensemble on campus and for approximately 350,000 fans each fall. The MSS is featured at nearly every campus-wide event, ranging from Freshman Convocation to the Homecoming Parade and Pep Rally. The band has been featured on the nationally syndicated &quot;Mike &amp; Mandy&quot; Radio Show, and is a star attraction at the Bandmaster&#x27;s Championship, a high school marching band contest administered by The University of Memphis Band Alumni Chapter. Members of the MSS represent all academic disciplines across campus and historically have been open to all students via audition.

===Mascot===

For over 30 years, since 1972, the sideline mascot for The University of Memphis has been a live Bengal tiger named TOM. During this time, the university has hosted three successive tigers, known respectively as TOM I, TOM II, and TOM III. The university also has a costumed tiger mascot known as Pouncer.

Throughout the majority of the TOM era, the tiger attended all Tiger football home games and other University events. TOM traveled in a climate-controlled trailer with a police escort and was housed and cared for by the Highland Hundred Tiger Guard, an alumni booster organization in a $300,000 facility.

TOM II matured, eventually weighing more than . The University of Memphis was one of only two universities in America with a live tiger mascot (the other being LSU in Baton Rouge). After being diagnosed with mouth cancer, TOM II was euthanized on October 15, 2008, at the age of 17. The team of veterinarians who oversaw TOM II decided this was necessary to ensure he did not suffer due to his illness.

TOM III, the most recent tiger, died on September 18, 2020. Following TOM&#x27;s passing it was announced that there would be a TOM IV, but it would be housed and remain at the Memphis Zoo.

The university currently has fifty tiger statues located on campus and another fifty located around the Memphis area. The Alumni Association placed the life-sized tigers around the city in honor of the university&#x27;s centennial in January 2012.

===Nickname===
When the University of Memphis first fielded a football team in the fall of 1912, no one had selected a nickname for the squad. Early references to the football team tabbed them only as the Blue and Gray Warriors.

After the final game of the 1914 season, there was a student parade. During this event, several university students shouted, &quot;We fight like Tigers!&quot; The nickname was born. As time passed, the nickname &quot;Tigers&quot; was increasingly used, particularly in campus publications, but did not catch on with the newspapers downtown. They continued to use &quot;the Blue and Gray&quot; when referring to the university. Blue and Gray represented the unity of the United States and in 1976, the Tigers wore red, white and blue in celebration of the United States Bicentennial.

Under Coach Lester Barnard in 1922, Memphis&#x27;s football team gave a ring of truth to that old student yell about Tigers. The team adopted a motto – &quot;Every Man a Tiger&quot; – and went on to score 174 points while allowing its opponents just 29 points. The Tiger nickname continued with students and alumni, eventually being adopted as the official nickname for the University of Memphis in 1939.

===Song===
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games is &quot;Go! Tigers! Go!&quot;, the University of Memphis Tigers&#x27; fight song. The fight song was written by Tom Ferguson, former Director of Bands at Memphis State University during the 1960s.

==Special programs and institutes==

===Tennessee Governor&#x27;s School for International Studies===
The Governor&#x27;s School for International Studies is an academic summer program for gifted junior and senior high school students in Tennessee. It is a selective program located at the University of Memphis in which students study two political sciences, a foreign language, and an elective of their choice from the international studies curriculum. The students, upon finishing the four-week term, gain six hours of college credit which may be transferred to any Tennessee Board of Regents School.

===Chucalissa Indian Village===
UofM also operates the Chucalissa Indian Village, an American Indian heritage site and museum. Officially known as the T. O. Fuller State Park, the location includes a museum and important archeological sites.

=== The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change ===

<doc id="628171" wikidata="Q390242" url="?curid=628171" title="Grenache">
<text>Grenache (; ) or Garnacha () is one of the most widely planted red wine grape varieties in the world. It ripens late, so it needs hot, dry conditions such as those found in Spain, where the grape is believed to have originated. It is also grown in the Italian island of Sardinia, the south of France, Australia, and California&#x27;s Monterey AVA, Paso Robles, Santa Barbara County and San Joaquin Valley.

It is generally spicy, berry-flavored and soft on the palate and produces wine with a relatively high alcohol content, but it needs careful control of yields for best results. Characteristic flavor profiles on Grenache include red fruit flavors (raspberry and strawberry) with a subtle, white pepper spice note. Grenache wines are highly prone to oxidation, with even young examples having the potential to show browning (or &quot;bricking&quot;) coloration that can be noticed around the rim when evaluating the wine at an angle in the glass. As Grenache ages the wines tend to take on more leather and tar flavors. Wines made from Grenache tend to lack acid, tannin and color, and it is often blended with other varieties such as Syrah, Carignan, Tempranillo, and Cinsaut.

In Spain, there are monovarietal wines made of &quot;Garnacha tinta&quot; (red Grenache), notably in the southern Aragon wine regions of Calatayud, Carinena and Campo de Borja, but it is also used in blends, as in some Rioja wines with tempranillo. Grenache is the dominant variety in most Southern Rhône wines, especially in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, where it is typically over 80% of the blend. In Australia it is typically blended in &quot;GSM&quot; blends with Syrah and Mourvèdre with old vine examples in McLaren Vale. In Italy, the Sardinian D.O.C. wine &quot;Cannonau di Sardegna&quot; is by law 90% local Grenache ( in Sardinian). Grenache is also used to make rosé wines in France and Spain, notably those of the Tavel district in the Côtes du Rhône and those of the Navarre region. And the high sugar levels of Grenache have led to extensive use in fortified wines, including the red vins doux naturels of Roussillon such as Banyuls, and as the basis of most Australian fortified wine.

==History==

Grenache or Garnacha (as it is known in Spain) most likely originated in the region of Aragon in northern Spain, according to ampelographical evidence. Plantings probably spread from the original birthplace to Catalonia and other lands under the Crown of Aragon such as Sardinia and Roussillon in southern France. An early synonym for the vine was &quot;Tinto Aragonés&quot; (red of Aragon). The grape is known as Cannonau in Sardinia, where it is claimed that it originated there according to recent archaeological finds, and spread to other Mediterranean lands under Aragon rule. Grenache, under its Spanish synonym Garnacha, was already well established on both sides of the Pyrenees when the Roussillon region was annexed by France. From there the vine made its way through the Languedoc and to the Southern Rhone region where it was well established by the 19th century. Despite its prevalence in nearby Navarre and Catalonia, Garnacha was not widely planted in the Rioja till the early 20th century as vineyards were replanted following the phylloxera epidemic.

Grenache was one of the first varieties to be introduced to Australia in the 18th century and eventually became the country&#x27;s most widely planted red wine grape variety until it was surpassed by Shiraz in the mid-1960s. Early Australian Grenache was a main component of the sweet fortified wines that were the lynchpin of the early Australian wine industry. In the 19th century, California wine growers prized the vine&#x27;s ability to produce high yields and withstand heat and drought conditions. The grape was extensively planted throughout the hot San Joaquin Valley where it was mainly used as a blending component for pale, sweet jug wines. In the late 20th century, the Rhone Rangers movement brought attention to the production of premium varietal Grenache and Rhone style blends modeled after the Grenache dominate wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. In the early 20th century, Grenache was one of the first &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; grapes to be successfully vinified during the early development of the Washington wine industry with a 1966 Yakima Valley &quot;rosé&quot; earning mention in wine historian Leon Adams treatise &quot;The Wines of America&quot;.

==Viticulture==

The Grenache vine is characterized by its strong wood canopy and upright growth. It has good wind tolerance (which is useful with the northerly &quot;Cierzo&quot; and &quot;Mistral&quot; winds that influence the regions of Aragon and the Rhone) and has shown itself to be very suited for the dry, warm windy climate around the Mediterranean. The vine buds early and requires a long growing season in order to fully ripen. Grenache is often one of the last grapes to be harvested, often ripening weeks after Cabernet Sauvignon. The long ripening process allows the sugars in the grape to reach high levels, making Grenache-based wines capable of substantial alcohol levels, often at least 15% ABV. While the vine is generally vigorous, it is susceptible to various grape diseases that can affect the yield and quality of the grape production such as &quot;coulure&quot;, bunch rot and downy mildew due to the vine&#x27;s tight grape clusters. Marginal and wet climates can increase Grenache&#x27;s propensity to develop these viticultural dangers. The vine&#x27;s drought resistance is dependent on the type of rootstock it is planted on but on all types of rootstocks, Grenache seems to respond favorably to some degree of moisture stress.

Grenache prefers hot, dry soils that are well drained but it is relatively adaptable to all vineyard soil types. In southern France, Grenache thrives on schist and granite soils and has responded well to the stony soil of Châteauneuf-du-Pape with the area&#x27;s &quot;galets roulés&quot;, heat-retentive stones. In Priorat, the crumbly schist soil of the region retains enough water to allow producers to avoid irrigation in the dry wine region. Vineyards with an overabundance of irrigation tend to produce pale colored wines with diluted flavors and excessive alcohol. Older vines with low yields can increase the concentration of phenolic compounds and produce darker, more tannic wines such as those found in the Priorat region of Spain where yields are often around 5-6 hectoliters/hectare (less than half a ton per acre). Yield control is intimately connected with the resulting quality of wine with yields below 35 hl/ha (2 tons/acre), such as those practiced by many Châteauneuf-du-Pape estates, producing very different wines to those with yields closer to 50 hl/ha (5 tons/acre) which is the base yield for &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) wines labeled under the Côtes du Rhône designation. The strong wood canopy of Grenache makes the vine difficult to harvest with mechanical harvesters and pruning equipment, and more labor-intensive to cultivate. In highly mechanized wine regions, such as Australia and California, this has contributed to a decline in the vine&#x27;s popularity.

===Mutants and crosses===
Over centuries, the Grenache vine has produced color mutation vines with berries of all range of colors. While Grenache &quot;noir&quot; or &quot;red&quot; Grenache is the most well known, Grenache blanc or &quot;white&quot; Grenache is a very important grape variety in France where it is the fourth most widely planted white variety after Ugni blanc, Chardonnay and Semillon. Like Grenache noir, it is a permitted variety in the blends of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. In Southern France and Sardinia, the mutants Grenache &quot;Rose&quot; and Grenache &quot;gris&quot; are also found making pale &quot;rosé&quot; and lightly tinted white wines. &quot;Hairy Grenache&quot; (&quot;Garnacha Peluda&quot; as known in Spain, and &quot;Garnatxa Peluda&quot; in Catalan) is a Grenache variant evolved to grow fuzz on the underside of its leaves to protect the vine from transpiration in hot climates, &quot;like the corresponding fuzz on rosemary or other mediterranean plants.&quot; Compared to its more widely planted cousin, it produces wines lower in alcohol and higher in acidity that show spicy and savory notes more readily as they age. It was not widely replanted after phylloxera as it was not well-adapted to making the vins doux naturels (see Fortified wine) that were &quot;all the rage&quot; at the time. The vine known as &quot;Garnacha Tintorera&quot; is a synonym for the teinturier grape Alicante which is a crossing of Grenache and Petite Bouschet. In 1961, a cross between Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon produced the French wine grape Marselan.

==Winemaking==

Grenache is often used as a blending component, adding body and sweet fruitiness to a wine. The grape can be troublesome for the winemaker due to tendency to oxidize easily and lose color. To compensate for the grape&#x27;s naturally low tannins and phenolic compounds, some producers will use excessively harsh pressing and hot fermentation with stems to extract the maximal amount of color and phenols from the skins. This can backfire to produce green, herbaceous flavors and coarse, astringent wine lacking the grape&#x27;s characteristic vibrant fruitiness. To maintain those character traits, Grenache responds best to a long, slow fermentation at cooler temperatures followed by a maceration period. To curb against oxidation, the wine should be racked as little as possible. The use of new oak barrels can help with retaining color and preventing oxidation but too much oak influence can cover up the fruitiness of Grenache.

The high levels of sugars and lack of harsh tannins, makes Grenache well adapted to the production of fortified wines, such as the &quot;vin doux naturels&quot; (VDN) of the Roussillon region (e.g. Rivesaltes, Banyuls, and Maury) and the &quot;port-style&quot; wines of Australia. In these wines, the must ferments for three days before grape spirit is added to the must to halt the fermentation and the conversion of sugar into alcohol. The high alcoholic proof grape spirit brings the finished wine up to 15–16% alcohol. These wines can be made in a &quot;rancio&quot; style by being left outside in glass demi-johns (or carboys) or wooden barrels where the wine bakes in the sun for several years until it develops a maderized character and flavors of sour raisins, nuts and cheese. These fortified VDNs and port-style wines have longevity and can be drinkable well into their third decade.

==Wine regions==
Grenache is one of the most widely planted red wine grape varieties in the world with France and Spain being its largest principal wine regions. In the late 20th century, total acreage of Grenache in Spain has been on the decline with the vineyards being uprooted in lieu of the more fashionable Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Between the late 1980s and 2004, Spanish plantings dropped from to allowing France with its to assume the mantle as the world&#x27;s largest source of Grenache. As of 2000, Grenache was the third most widely planted red wine grape variety in France, behind Merlot and Carignan. From French nurseries, Grenache has become the fourth most widely propagated vine with more than 23 million cuttings sold since 1998 according to French ampelographer Pierre Galet.

===France===

In France, Grenache is most widely associated with the wines of the Rhône and southern France. Its history in the Rhône can be traced to the influence of Burgundian wine merchants in the 17-18th centuries who sought a blending variety to add body and alcohol content to their light body wines. Grenache, with its propensity for high alcohol and high yields, fit those desires nicely and was widely planted in the Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas and Vacqueyras regions. Today Grenache is most widely planted in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, widely blended with Carignan, Cinsaut, Syrah and Mourvèdre. The vine also has sizable plantings in the Drôme department. The vine&#x27;s strong, hard wood and affinity for bush vine training allows it to thrive in the Mistral influenced southern Rhone regions of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas. In Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache noir is the most common variety of the 13 permitted varieties, although some producers in recent years have been using a higher proportion of Mourvèdre. Grenache produces a sweet juice that can have almost a jam-like consistency when very ripe. Syrah is typically blended to provide color and spice, while Mourvèdre can add elegance and structure to the wine.

The grape&#x27;s thin skin and pale coloring makes it well-suited for the production of full bodied, fruit &quot;rosé&quot; wines. Grenache is the principal grape behind the rosés of Tavel and Lirac and plays an important role in the Provence region as well. In the Roussillon region, Grenache noir and its &quot;gris&quot; and &quot;blanc&quot; mutations are used in the production of the fortified &quot;vin doux naturels&quot; of Rivesaltes, Banyuls, and Maury. The characteristic of French Grenache-based wines depends largely on the selection of its blending partners and can range from the spicy richness associated with Châteauneuf-du-Pape to the chewy fruitiness associated with basic Côtes du Rhône Villages. Other regions with sizable plantings of Grenache include the &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) regions of Minervois, Fitou and Corbières.

===Spain===
In Spain, Grenache is known as Garnacha (Garnatxa in Basque and Catalan) and given the likely history of the grape this is most likely the grape&#x27;s original name (although the RAE gives Italian &quot;vernaccia&quot; as the etymology). There are several clonal varieties of Garnacha with the thin-skinned, dark colored &quot;Garnacha Tinta&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Tinto&quot;) being the most common. Another variety, known as &quot;Garnacha Peluda&quot; or &quot;Hairy Grenache&quot; due to the soft hairy texture on the underside of the vine&#x27;s leaves is also found in Spain, mostly in Borja and Cariñena (Aragón). Compared to its more widely planted cousin, it produces wines lower in alcohol and higher in acidity that show spicy and savory notes more readily as they age. Widely planted in northeastern and central Spain, Garnacha was long considered a &quot;workhorse&quot; grape of low quality suitable for blending. In the late 20th century, the success of the Garnacha-based wines from Priorat in Catalonia (as well as the emerging international attention given to the New World Rhone Rangers) sparked a re-evaluation of this &quot;workhorse&quot; variety. Today it is the third most widely planted red grape variety in Spain (behind Tempranillo and Bobal) with more than and is seen in both varietal wines and blends.

Garnacha plays a major role in the &quot;denominación de origen protegida&quot; (DOP) wines in Aragon, Catalonia, and Navarre and the &quot;denominación de origen calificada&quot; (DOC/DOQ) wines of Rioja and Priorat, plus the mountainous areas just southwest of Madrid: Méntrida and Cebreros. Other Spanish wine regions with sizable Garnacha plantings include Costers del Segre, Empordà, La Mancha, Madrid, Penedès, Somontano, Tarragona and Terra Alta.

====Aragon====
Aragon, believed to be the probable origin of the grape, concentrates the largest surface of Grenache (or Garnacha as it is called locally) in Spain, with planted. Garnacha is the dominant variety in the region and is typically used to produce single variety wines. Even though in the mid-20th century Garnacha was considered a &quot;workhorse&quot; variety for large volume wines, in the last 20 years a new generation of winemakers have taken a new approach, by controlling yields, taking advantage of the old vines (from 30 to more than 100 years), and applying modern techniques in combination with old traditions to increase concentration. The DOP of Calatayud (91% of its production is Grenache) holds the highest altitude Garnacha vineyards and is the only DOP to legally define &quot;old vines&quot; (35 years minimum). In the Campo de Borja DOP, 30+-years-old Garnacha bush trained vines and manual harvest are common; the grapes are typically slightly raisined, jammy fruit that generates alcohol of 14-14.5%. The Cariñena DOP has the largest surface of Garnacha vineyards in the region with , many of them old vines. Although many of Somontano DOP wines are now produced with international grape varieties, some of the oldest high altitude vineyards are still traditional Garnacha.

====Rioja====
In Rioja the grape is planted mostly in the warmer Rioja Baja region located in the eastern expanse of the wine region. Usually blended with Tempranillo, Garnacha provides juicy fruitiness and added body. In recent years, modern Rioja producers have been increasing the amount of Garnacha used in the blend in order to produce earlier maturing and more approachable Riojas in their youth. Garnacha is also used in the pale colored &quot;rosados&quot; of Rioja. The vine has a long history in the Navarre region where it has been the dominant red grape variety with nearly 54% of the region&#x27;s vineyard planted with Garnacha.

====Navarre====
Compared to neighboring Rioja, the Garnacha-based blends of Navarre are lighter and fruitier, meant for earlier consumption.

====Priorat====
Ampelographers believe Garnacha has had a presence in the Priorat region of Catalonia for several hundred years (possibly nearly 800 years) but since the 1990s the region&#x27;s old Garnacha have garnered much attention. A wave of ambitious young winemakers rediscovered the low-yield, bush-vine trained Garnacha planted throughout the llicorella (brown schist) based soils of Priorat. This unique combination of extremely old vines (the average age in most vineyards is between 35 and 60 years) planted on steep terraces and soil produces very low yields (around 5-6 hectoliters per hectare) which makes Priorat a dense, rich concentrated and dark colored wine with noticeable tannins. The traditional Priorat wine would be almost black in color and require years of aging before it would be approachable to drink. Nearly 40% of all the vineyard land in the Priorat region is planted to Garnacha, and most of the rest is Carignan but the acreage of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot increased before 2000 as modernist producers sought to blend those varieties to add complexity. Some of these new modern style Priorats tend to show softer, blackberry fruit in their youth and over time develop notes of figs and tar.

===Italy===
Grenache is most commonly found as in the island of Sardinia where it is one of the principal grapes in the isle&#x27;s deeply colored, full bodied red wines that routinely maintain alcohol levels around 15%. The Sardinian D.O.C. wine &quot;Cannonau di Sardegna&quot; is by law at least 90% local Grenache (&quot;Cannonau&quot;).

Grenache is also found in the regions of Sicily, Umbria (specifically in Trasimeno lake area), Marche and Calabria. Grenache is known under various name in Italy, like &quot;Alicante&quot;, &quot;Tocai rosso&quot;, &quot;Guarnaccia&quot;, &quot;Bordò&quot;, and &quot;Vernaccia Nera&quot;.

===Other Old World regions===
Grenache has been grown in Israel since the 19th century and was once an important grape in the Algerian wine industry. Today there are still some producers in Morocco producing Grenache &quot;rosés&quot;. Sizable plantings of Grenache are also found in Cyprus and scattered among the Greek islands.

===Australia===

A clone from Perpignan arrived in Australia with James Busby in his 1832 collection. More significant was the introduction into South Australia of new cuttings from the South of France, by Dr Christopher Rawson Penfold in 1844. Plantings in South Australia boomed, particularly in McLaren Vale, the Barossa Valley and Clare Valley. Until the mid 20th century, Grenache was Australia&#x27;s most widely planted red wine grape variety with significant plantings in the vast Riverland region where it was vital component in the fortified &quot;port-style&quot; wines of the early Australian industry. As Australian winemakers started to focus more on premium still wines, Grenache gradually fell out of favor being supplanted by Shiraz and later Cabernet Sauvignon in Australian vineyards. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw a revival of interest in Grenache with old vine plantings in South Australia being used to produce varietal Grenache as well as a &quot;GSM&quot;-Grenache, Syrah and Mouvedre-blends becoming popular. Varietal Grenache from the McLaren Vale is characterized by luscious richness and spicy notes while Barossa Valley Grenache is characterized by jammy, intense fruitiness.

===United States===
In the early California wine industry, Grenache&#x27;s high yields and alcohol level made it an ideal blending component for jug wine production. Early plantings centered in the hot central San Joaquin Valley, where the grape benefitted from its tolerance to heat and drought. It was first used to produce sweet, pale colored &quot;white Grenache&quot; wines similar in quality and substance to White Zinfandel. The late 20th century saw a revival of interest in the variety spearheaded by the Rhone Rangers movement. These producers imported new cuttings from the Rhone valley for planting in the cooler Central Coast region for use in the production of premium varietal Grenache and Rhone style blends. Some historic old vine plantings of Grenache in Mendocino County has also garnered interest in recent years. In the early 20th century, Grenache was one of the first &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; grapes to be successfully vinified during the early development of the Washington wine industry with a 1966 Yakima Valley &quot;rosé&quot; earning mention in wine historian Leon Adams&#x27;s treatise &quot;The Wines of America&quot;. Despite its long history, Grenache has been a minor grape variety in Washington but has seen an increase in plantings in recent years due to the &quot;Rhone Ranger&quot; movement in the state. Older plantings in the Horse Heaven Hills and Columbia Gorge American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) have also begun to attract interest.

=== South Africa ===
Grenache Noir came to the Cape in the 19th century but was only confirmed as such in the early 1900s by a Stellenbosch University professor. While there isn&#x27;t a lot of Grenache Noir planted in South Africa at only 305 hectares in 2014, many of the 100+ Grenache based blends are proving to be very fashionable with winemakers due to South Africa&#x27;s warm climate, dry land and granitic soils.

===Other New World wine regions===
Despite being one of the world&#x27;s most widely planted red grape varieties, Grenache&#x27;s colonization of the New World has been limited apart from strongholds in Australia and California. The rising popularity and success of the Rhone Ranger&#x27;s movement has brought greater attention to the variety and more plantings of Grenache are popping up every year in places like Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and South Africa.

==Wines==

Though Grenache is most often encountered in blended wines (such as the Rhone wines or GSM blends), varietal examples of Grenache do exist. As a blending component, Grenache is valued for the added body and fruitiness that it brings without added tannins. As a varietal, the grape&#x27;s naturally low concentration of phenolics contribute to its pale color and lack of extract but viticultural practices and low yields can increase the concentrations of phenolic compounds. Grenache-based wines tend to be made for early consumption with its propensity for oxidation make it a poor candidate for long-term aging. However, producers (such as some examples from Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Priorat) who use low yields grown on poor soils can produce dense, concentrated wines that can benefit from cellaring. The fortified &quot;vin doux naturels&quot; of France and Australian &quot;port-style&quot; wines are protected from Grenache&#x27;s propensity for oxidation by the fortification process and can usually be drinkable for two or three decades.

The characteristic notes of Grenache are berry fruit such as raspberries and strawberries. When yields are kept in check, Grenache-based wines can develop complex and intense notes of blackcurrants, black cherries, black olives, coffee, gingerbread, honey, leather, black pepper, tar, spices, and roasted nuts. When yields are increased, more overtly earthy and herbal notes emerge that tend to quickly fade on the palate. The very low-yielding old vines of Priorat can impart dark black fruits and notes of figs and tar with many traits similar to the Italian wine Amarone. Rosado or &quot;rosé&quot; Grenaches are often characterized by their strawberry and cream notes while fortified &quot;vin doux nautrels&quot; and Australian &quot;port style&quot; wines exhibits coffee and nutty tawny-like notes.

<text>Francis Anthony Keating II (born February 10, 1944, as David Rowland Keating) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 25th governor of Oklahoma from 1995 to 2003.

, Keating is one of only five governors in Oklahoma history, in addition to George Nigh, Brad Henry, Mary Fallin, and Kevin Stitt to hold consecutive terms and the first Republican to accomplish that feat. As governor, he oversaw the state&#x27;s response to the Oklahoma City bombing. His term was also marked by the enactment of welfare reform and tax cuts.

Keating oversaw the execution of 52 people under his term as governor, a record unmatched as of 2023.

==Early life==
Keating was born on February 10, 1944, in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Mary Ann (Martin) and Anthony Francis Keating. He was born David Rowland Keating, but his name was changed to Francis Anthony Keating II when he was two. Before he was six months old, his family moved to Oklahoma and settled in Tulsa. A practicing Catholic, Keating attended Cascia Hall Preparatory School in Tulsa, graduating in 1962. Keating attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. where he was president of the college student body, an editor of &quot;The Hoya&quot;, and a member of the Philodemic Debating Society, receiving his Bachelor of Arts in history, in 1966. He obtained a J.D. from the University of Oklahoma College of Law, in 1969, where he also was student body president.

Upon completing law school, Keating began his career in law enforcement. The same year he finished law school, Keating was made a Special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Relocated to the West Coast, Keating was charged with investigating terrorism incidents in the area and other various duties. After years on the coast, Keating returned to Tulsa to become an assistant district attorney.

In 1973, Keating, was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. He would serve a single term in the House, until 1975, when he was elected to the Oklahoma Senate. He would serve in the Senate from 1975 until 1981. While in the Senate, Keating became the minority leader.

==Federal career==
Keating&#x27;s law enforcement career and prominence in the Oklahoma Republican Party prompted newly elected President Ronald Reagan to appoint Keating as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma. Keating served from 1981 until 1983, serving for part of that time as chairman of all U.S. Attorneys. During this time, he was one of three US Attorneys in Oklahoma handling the Oklahoma county commissioner scandal, which resulted in conviction of 230 people, including 110 county commissioners, for public corruption. He gave up that post in 1983 to run for Congress in and ran a competitive race which fell short of defeating Democratic Congressman and House Budget Committee chairman James R. Jones, who won re-election with 52 percent of the vote even though Republican President Reagan carried the district.

Shortly after Reagan was sworn in for his second term, he appointed Keating to serve as an assistant secretary of the Treasury and later elevated him to associate attorney general, the third ranking official within the U.S. Department of Justice. These appointments made Keating the highest ranking Oklahoman during the Reagan administration. In his positions as assistant secretary of the Treasury and associate attorney general, Keating oversaw both the Justice and Treasury&#x27;s law enforcement agencies. These included the United States Customs Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Secret Service, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, all 94 U.S. Attorneys and the U.S. role in Interpol.

Late in the Reagan Administration, Keating continued to serve in the Justice Department in his role as associate attorney general. In 1990, President Bush elevated Keating to general counsel and acting deputy secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that department&#x27;s second highest office, under Secretary Jack Kemp. He would serve as deputy secretary until 1993. As was the case in the Reagan administration, Keating became the highest ranking Oklahoman in the federal government, under Bush.

On November 14, 1991, Bush nominated Keating to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, but with Democratic control of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Keating&#x27;s nomination languished and no hearing was held before Bush&#x27;s presidency ended. President Bill Clinton chose not to renominate Keating, instead nominating former Oklahoma Attorney General Robert Harlan Henry, who was subsequently confirmed.

==Gubernatorial campaigns==

===1994===

After two years of private life, in 1994, Keating received the Republican nomination for Governor of Oklahoma. In a three-way race against Democratic nominee Jack Mildren and independent Wes Watkins, Keating was elected with just under 47 percent of the vote. He was undoubtedly helped by the presence of Watkins, a former Democratic Congressman, on the ballot; Watkins siphoned off a number of votes that would have likely gone to Mildren in a two-way race with Keating; his 233,300 votes far exceeded Keating&#x27;s 171,000-vote margin of victory. Keating was sworn in as the 25th Governor of Oklahoma on January 9, 1995. He was only the third Republican ever to hold the post.

===1998===

Keating faced Democratic nominee Laura Boyd, the first woman to receive a major party&#x27;s nomination for Oklahoma Governor, in his 1998 re-election campaign. Keating won in a landslide victory, the second of five Governors in Oklahoma history to win two consecutive terms (after George Nigh) and preceding Democrat Brad Henry. He was the only Republican to do so before Mary Fallin in 2014

==Governor of Oklahoma==
===Oklahoma City bombing===

Within three months of taking office, on April 19, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was destroyed in the Oklahoma City bombing, in which the lives of 168 people were lost and over 800 people were injured. The blast destroyed or damaged more than 300 buildings in the surrounding area, leaving several hundred people homeless and shutting down business.

Governor Keating mobilized relief and rescue teams to handle the crisis. Over 12,000 people participated in relief and rescue operations in the days following the blast. The national and worldwide humanitarian response was immediate and overwhelming. Governor Keating declared a state of emergency, which allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to activate 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces to assist in rescue and recovery operations.

The national focus climaxed on April 23, when President Bill Clinton, along with Governor Keating and the Reverend Billy Graham, spoke in Oklahoma City. In the weeks following the bombing, rescue efforts ceased and the building was imploded. Through both his own works and the works of his wife Cathy Keating, Governor Keating gained both national and international attention for his efforts to help the victims and their families. Governor Keating also created a $6 million fund to assist victims and provide for college scholarships for children who lost a parent, or both parents, in the attack.

===First term===
Governor Keating set out with an agenda for the state under his administration, with many of his initiatives passed, despite an often hostile Democratic controlled Legislature. Many of Keating&#x27;s proposals were policies designed for growth and reform for Oklahoma. These included education reform, environmental protection, tax relief, road building, economic development, public safety, and tougher law enforcement. Keating created a public-private partnership to assure care for the indigent as well as a stronger medical education program.

Keating&#x27;s first major success was the passage of the first welfare reform law in the nation in 1995. The success of the law served as a model for President Clinton&#x27;s welfare reform act of 1996. Keating managed to improve road and highway conditions throughout the state without raising taxes.

Keating implemented tougher parole policies and introduced a landmark truth-in-sentencing legislation. Keating also provided no amnesty when handling death sentence criminals, allowing all of those sentenced to death to be executed. Keating also raised the salaries of Oklahoma&#x27;s state troopers from the lowest in the nation to the 24th highest.

Keating appointed a special task force that created tougher regulations on Oklahoma&#x27;s hog and poultry industries.

In 1998, Keating became the first governor in 50 years to achieve a tax cut in the state&#x27;s income tax. This combined with reduction in the sales tax, estate tax, and unemployment tax formed the largest tax break in the state&#x27;s history until that point.

===Second term===
Sworn in on January 11, 1999, Keating&#x27;s second term began with a progressive agenda, based primarily on education. In his 1999 inaugural address, Keating set four goals for Oklahoma for his second term:
# Raising Oklahoma&#x27;s ACT to the national average by 2005,
# Decreasing Oklahoma&#x27;s divorce rate by 50% before 2010,
# Ensure one out of every three Oklahomans has a college degree by 2010, and
# Raising Oklahoma&#x27;s per capita income to reach the national average by 2025
Keating focused largely on education. He increased spending for common, vo-tech, and higher education facilities throughout the state and introduced charter schools to Oklahoma for the first time. His policies and recommendations on education to the Legislature lead to the largest investment, over $100 million, on higher education. Keating, in 2000, also raised teacher pay by over $3000 annually, the largest raise Oklahoma&#x27;s teacher had ever experienced. Keating even managed to get higher educational facilities attracted to Tulsa for the first time. His legislative agenda required that all Oklahoma students take three years of math and four years of English, History and Science before graduation.

Along with the agenda set forth in his inaugural address, Keating sought to address out-of-wedlock births, substance abuse, and child abuse. Enlisting state government, community groups, and faith organizations, he organized the statewide initiative to strengthen marriage.

Keating struggled to get workers&#x27; compensation reform and right to work laws enacted due to the political makeup of the Oklahoma Legislature. Keating adjusted policies, made new appointments to Oklahoma&#x27;s Worker&#x27;s Compensation Court, and took other measures to control Oklahoma&#x27;s rising worker&#x27;s compensation costs. He would have to wait two years to see his vision for a right to work fulfilled. The Legislature decided to propose anti-union right to work measures as a 2001 constitutional amendment. Keating&#x27;s six-year battle came to an end when, on September 21, 2001, Oklahomans approved the measure.

As he had done in first term, Keating sought to grant broad-based tax cuts. To further reduce taxes, Keating won passage of an income tax break and of the creation of Oklahoma&#x27;s earned income credit system to benefit the poor. Also, under Keating&#x27;s auspices, both Democratic and Republican leaders in the Legislature launched studies to examine Oklahoma&#x27;s tax system, with the purpose of overhauling the entire system. During the study, the complete elimination of Oklahoma&#x27;s income tax was proposed.

Keating signed a major criminal justice bill that reformed Truth in Sentencing law in Oklahoma.

In other legislative initiatives, Keating signed the repeal of Oklahoma&#x27;s annual vehicle inspection program. He also granted state correctional officers and highway patrol troopers pay raises. Keating addressed the problems faced in Oklahoma&#x27;s Tar Creek Superfund site by appointing a task force on the issue.

Among Keating&#x27;s other accomplishments; overseeing the largest road construction project in Oklahoma history and leading his state through devastating tornadoes in 1999. As a crowning achievement, Keating raised more than $20 million in private money towards completion of the Oklahoma State Capitol with a dome. The capitol was originally designed for a dome, but state funding for it had run dry during World War I.

Term limits prevented him from running for a third term; he was succeeded by Brad Henry as governor.

===Judicial appointments===
Governor Keating appointed the following members of the Judiciary of Oklahoma:

====Appellate courts====
====Trial courts====
====Courts of limited jurisdiction====
==2000 presidential election==
During the 2000 presidential election, Keating, while still Governor of Oklahoma, was considered a potential candidate for the Republican nomination of Vice President of the United States under George W. Bush.

==Post-governorship==
In 2002 he authored a children&#x27;s book about Oklahoma humorist Will Rogers. Another children&#x27;s book about Theodore Roosevelt followed in 2006. Keating&#x27;s third children&#x27;s book about the trial of Standing Bear was published in 2008. His most recent children&#x27;s book about George Washington was published in 2012. Keating also served on the boards of the National Archives, the Jamestown Foundation, the Federal City Council, and Mt. Vernon. He was president of the Federal City Council and chairman of the Mount Vernon Advisory Board. He currently lives in McLean, Virginia

Keating and his wife Cathy are the parents of three children, Carrie, Kelly, and Chip. In 2001, Cathy Keating was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination to one of Oklahoma&#x27;s seats in the U.S. House of Representatives being vacated by Steve Largent. In 2006, Chip Keating was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination to a seat in the Oklahoma House of Representatives.

On December 2, 2006, columnist Robert Novak suggested Keating might be a candidate for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination.

On December 20, 2006, Keating visited Columbia, South Carolina, where he spoke to a group of GOP supporters about a possible 2008 Presidential bid. On January 17, 2007, Keating was quoted in the &quot;Tulsa World&quot; as declining a possible run for the U.S. presidency in 2008. His reasons for not running were associated with the relative head starts in preparations of U.S. Senator John McCain and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. In February 2007 Keating appeared in Spartanburg, South Carolina and endorsed McCain&#x27;s bid.

Following his two terms as governor, Keating accepted a position as president and chief executive officer of the American Council of Life Insurers, the trade association for the life insurance and retirement security industry. Keating&#x27;s former Secretary of State, Michael J. Hunter, served alongside his former boss at ACLI where Hunter served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

On January 1, 2011, Keating became president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. Founded in 1875, the American Bankers Association represents banks of all sizes and charters and is the voice for the nation&#x27;s $14 trillion banking industry and its 2 million employees.

Keating served as a member of the Debt Reduction Task Force and Housing Commission at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

Amid the immigration debate of 2013, Keating wrote an op-ed in which he announced support for the bipartisan Senate comprehensive immigration reform bill, arguing among other things that the bill&#x27;s passage would shore up the future solvency of Social Security and Medicare.

On February 4, 2016, Keating joined the law firm of Holland &amp; Knight as a partner.

On March 14, 2017, Keating was nominated by Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin to serve on the University of Oklahoma Board of Regents.

In April 2017, Keating created a one-minute video regretting his support for wind energy while Oklahoma governor. &quot;We made a mistake...this is a calamity for taxpayers&quot;.

== Events ==
* April 19, 1995: Three months after he was sworn in as Oklahoma governor, a fertilizer bomb exploded in front of a federal building in the capital killing 168 people. 
* June 2002: Keating, a practicing Roman Catholic, was named chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops National Review Board examining sex abuse by Catholic priests.
** June 16, 2003: Keating stepped down from the Review Board. The resignation came days after Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony criticized Keating for comparing some church leaders to the Mafia. In his resignation letter, Keating said, &quot;My remarks, which some Bishops found offensive, were deadly accurate. I make no apology... To resist Grand Jury subpoenas, to suppress the names of offending clerics, to deny, to obfuscate, to explain away; that is the model of a criminal organization, not my church.&quot;
* Supported disbarred Oklahoma attorney William C. Donovan who was disbarred for financial crimes of embezzlement and conversion and openly retaliated against innocent Christian families. https://www.leagle.com/decision/19971259934p2d32511256

Sangiovese Grosso, used for traditionally powerful and slow maturing red wines, is primarily grown in the central regions of Italy, particularly in Tuscany, where it is the dominant grape variety. Here, Sangiovese thrives in various subregions, including Chianti, Montalcino, and Montepulciano, 
whose diverse terroirs winemakers put to good use to craft wines that reflect the land&#x27;s unique nuances.

Sangiovese&#x27;s ability to express terroir and age gracefully has earned it a revered status among wine enthusiasts worldwide, cementing its place as one of Italy&#x27;s most cherished grape varieties. Because of its distinctive character and versatility, Sangiovese is the singular or primary grape variety used in iconic Italian wines from Tuscany such as bold and age-worthy Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, to vibrant and fruity wines like Morellino di Scansano, Carmignano and Chianti Classico.

Sangiovese is also cultivated in other parts of central Italy, such as Umbria and Marche, where it is sometimes blended for the production of notable wines like Sagrantino di Montefalco and Rosso Conero.

While its stronghold is in the central region of the country, Sangiovese is also grown in smaller quantities in regions like Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, and even as far south as Calabria where it can be used to make varietal wines such as Sangiovese di Romagna and some of the modern &quot;Super Tuscan&quot; wines like Tignanello, a blend of 80% Sangiovese 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc or &#x27;Colore&#x27; Bibi Graetz made with 100% Sangiovese from old vines.

Sangiovese was already well known by the 16th century. Recent DNA profiling by José Vouillamoz of the Istituto Agrario di San Michele all’Adige suggests that Sangiovese&#x27;s ancestors are Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. The former is well known as an ancient variety in Tuscany, the latter is an almost-extinct relic from Calabria, the toe of Italy. At least fourteen Sangiovese clones exist, of which Brunello is one of the best regarded. An attempt to classify the clones into &quot;Sangiovese grosso&quot; (including Brunello) and &quot;Sangiovese piccolo&quot; families has gained little evidential support.

Young Sangiovese has fresh fruity flavours of strawberry and a little spiciness, but it readily takes on oaky, even tarry, flavours when aged in barrels. While not as aromatic as other red wine varieties such as Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah, Sangiovese often has a flavour profile of sour red cherries with earthy aromas and tea leaf notes. Wines made from Sangiovese usually have medium-plus tannins and high acidity.

==History==

Early theories on the origin of Sangiovese dated the grape to the time of Roman winemaking. It was even postulated that the grape was first cultivated in Tuscany by the Etruscans from wild &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; vines. The literal translation of the grape&#x27;s name, the &quot;blood of Jove&quot;, refers to the Roman god Jupiter. According to legend, the name was coined by monks from the commune of Santarcangelo di Romagna in what became the province of Rimini in the Emilia-Romagna region of east-central Italy.

The first documented mention of Sangiovese was in the 1590 writings of Giovanvettorio Soderini (also known under the pen name of &quot;Ciriegiulo&quot;). Identifying the grape as &quot;Sangiogheto&quot; Soderini notes that in Tuscany the grape makes very good wine but if the winemaker is not careful, it risks turning into vinegar. While there is no conclusive proof that &quot;Sangiogheto&quot; is Sangiovese, most wine historians consider this the first historical mention of the grape. Regardless, it would not be until the 18th century that Sangiovese would gain widespread attention throughout Tuscany, being with Malvasia and Trebbiano the most widely planted grapes in the region.

In 1738, Cosimo Trinci described wines made from Sangiovese as excellent when blended with other varieties but hard and acidic when made as a wine by itself. In 1883, the Italian writer Giovanni Cosimo Villifranchi echoed a similar description about the quality of Sangiovese being dependent on the grapes with which it was blended. The winemaker and politician, Bettino Ricasoli formulated one of the early recipes for Chianti when he blended his Sangiovese with a sizable amount of Canaiolo. In the wines of Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Sangiovese would experience a period of popularity in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 1970s, Tuscan winemakers began a period of innovation by introducing modern oak treatments and blending the grape with non-Italian varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon in the creation of wines that were given the collective marketing sobriquet &quot;Super Tuscans&quot;.

===Parentage===

In 2004, DNA profiling done by researchers at San Michele All&#x27;Adige revealed the grape to be the product of a crossing between Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. While Ciliegiolo has a long history tied to the Tuscan region, Calabrese Montenuovo (which is not related to the grape commonly known as Calabrese, or Nero d&#x27;Avola) has its origins in southern Italy, where it probably originated in the Calabria region before moving its way up to Campania. This essentially means that the genetic heritage of Sangiovese is half Tuscan and half southern Italian.

Where the crossing between Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo occurred is not known, with some believing the cross happened in Tuscany while other ampelographers suggesting it may have happened in southern Italy. Evidence for this latter theory is the proliferation of seedless mutations of Sangiovese, known under various synonyms, throughout various regions of southern Italy including Campania, &quot;Corinto nero&quot; which is grown on the island of Lipari just north of Sicily and &quot;Tuccanese&quot; from the Apulia region in the heel of the Italian boot. In Campania, among the many seedless mutations of Sangiovese still growing in the region are &quot;Nerello&quot; from the commune of Savelli, &quot;Nerello Campotu&quot; from the commune of Motta San Giovanni, &quot;Puttanella&quot; from Mandatoriccio and &quot;Vigna del Conte&quot;.

====Relationship with Ciliegiolo====
While the parentage of Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo for Sangiovese was established based on 50 genetic markers and is generally accepted by ampelographers, some wine texts publish contradictory information that Ciliegiolo is an offspring (rather than parent) of Sangiovese. This belief is based on a 2007 study of 38 genetic markers stating that suggested that Ciliegiolo was the product of Sangiovese crossing with an obscure Portuguese wine grape, Muscat Rouge de Madère, that was once grown on the island of Madeira as well as the Douro and Lisboa wine regions of Portugal. In addition to support of fewer genetic markers, this alternative theory is disputed by geneticists such as José Vouillamoz and Masters of Wine like Jancis Robinson because Muscat Rouge de Madère has no history of ever being cultivated in Italy (where it could have crossed with Sangiovese). Furthermore, while many grapes with lineage involving members of the Muscat family of grapes tend to have pronounced &quot;grapey&quot; flavours characteristic of Muscat grapes, Ciliegiolo exhibits none of those flavour profiles which makes it unlikely to be an offspring of Muscat Rouge de Madère.

===Clones and offspring===
Early ampelographical research into Sangiovese begun in 1906 with the work of Girolamo Molon. Molon discovered that the Italian grape known as &quot;Sangiovese&quot; was actually several &quot;varieties&quot; of clones which he broadly classified as Sangiovese Grosso and Sangiovese Piccolo. The Sangiovese Grosso family included the clones growing in the Brunello region as well as the clones known as &quot;Prugnolo Gentile&quot; and &quot;Sangiovese di Lamole&quot; that was grown in the Greve in Chianti region. The Sangiovese Grosso, according to Molon, produced the highest quality wine, while the varieties in the Sangiovese Piccolo family, which included the majority of clones, produced wine of a lesser degree of quality. In the late 20th century, research by the Italian government and Chianti Classico Consorizo discovered that some of the best producing clones, from a wine quality perspective, came from the Emilia-Romagna region where they are today being propagated under the names &quot;R24&quot; and &quot;T19&quot;.

Another Italian study published in 2008 using DNA typing showed a close genetic relationship between Sangiovese on the one hand and ten other Italian grape varieties on the other hand: Foglia Tonda, Frappato, Gaglioppo, Mantonicone, Morellino del Casentino, Morellino del Valdarno, Nerello Mascalese, Tuccanese di Turi, Susumaniello, and Vernaccia Nera del Valdarno. It is possible, and even likely, that Sangiovese is one of the parents of each of these grape varieties. Since these grape varieties are spread over different parts of Italy (Apulia, Calabria, Sicily and Tuscany), this confirmed by genetic methods that Sangiovese is a key variety in the pedigree of red Italian grape varieties.

DNA analysis in 2001 also suggests a strong genetic relationship between Sangiovese and Aleatico, a grape variety predominantly growing in Apulia, though the exact nature of this relationship has yet to be determined.

==Viticulture==

Sangiovese has shown itself to be adaptable to many different types of vineyard soils but seems to thrive in soils with a high concentration of limestone, having the potential to produce elegant wines with forceful aromas. In the Chianti Classico region, Sangiovese thrives on the highly friable shale-clay soil known as &quot;galestro&quot;. In the Montalcino region, there is a high proportion of limestone-based &quot;alberese&quot; soils alternating with deposits of &quot;galestro&quot;. The lesser zones of the generic Chianti appellation are predominantly clay, which often produce as high quality of wine as &quot;alberese&quot; and &quot;galestro&quot; do.

The grape requires a long growing season, as it buds early and is slow to ripen. The grape requires sufficient warmth to ripen fully, but too much warmth and its flavours can become diluted. Harvests in Italy have traditionally begun after September 29, with modern harvest often taking place in mid-late October. A longer growing season gives the grapes time to develop richness and potential body. However, in cool vintages this can result in the grapes having high levels of acidity and harsh, unripened tannins. In regions (like some areas of Tuscany) that are prone to rainfall in October, there is a risk for rot due to the Sangiovese grape&#x27;s thin skin. In other areas, such as the dry conditions of the Columbia Valley AVA of Washington State, the grape has good resistance to drought conditions and often requires little irrigation.

For the best quality, yields need to be kept in check as the vine is notably vigorous and prone to overproduction. In Chianti, most quality conscious producers limit their yields to 3 pounds (1.5 kg) of fruit per vine. Wine made from high-yielding vines tend to produce wines with light color, high acidity, and less alcohol, which are likely to oxidize (&quot;brown&quot;) prematurely due to a lower concentration of tannins and anthocyanins (anti-oxidants). Fully developed grapes are typically 19 mm long x 17 mm wide, with an average weight of 3 grams.

Soils with low fertility are ideal and help control some of the vigor of the vine. Planting vines in high densities in order to curb vigor may have the adverse effect of increasing foliage and limiting the amount of direct sunlight that can reach the ripening grapes. Advances in understanding the quality and characteristics of the different clones of Sangiovese has led to the identification and propagation of superior clones. While high-yielding clones have been favored in the past, more attention is being paid to matching the clone to the vineyard site and controlling the vine&#x27;s vigor.

==Winemaking==

The high acidity and light body characteristics of the Sangiovese grape can present a problem for winemaking. The grape also lacks some of the color-creating phenolic compounds known as acylated anthocyanins. Modern winemakers have devised many techniques trying to find ways to add body and texture to Sangiovese — ranging from using grapes that come from extremely low yielding vines, to adjusting the temperature and length of fermentation and employing extensive oak treatment. One historical technique is the blending of other grape varieties with Sangiovese, in order to complement its attractive qualities and fill in the gaps of some of its weaker points. The Sangiovese-based wines of Chianti have a long tradition of liberally employed blending partners—such as Canaiolo, Ciliegiolo, Mammolo, Colorino and even the white wine grapes like Trebbiano and Malvasia. Since the late 20th century, Bordeaux grapes, most notably Cabernet Sauvignon, have been a favored blending partner though in many Italian DOC/DOCG regions there is often a maximum limit on the amount of other varietals that can be blended with Sangiovese; in Chianti the limit for Cabernet is 15%.

Other techniques used to improve the quality of Sangiovese include extending the maceration period from 7–12 days to 3–4 weeks to give the must more time to leach vital phenols out of the grape skins. Transferring the wine during fermentation into new oak barrels for malolactic fermentation gives greater polymerization of the tannins and contributes to a softer, rounder mouthfeel. Additionally, Sangiovese has shown itself to be a &quot;sponge&quot; for soaking up sweet vanilla and other oak compounds from the barrel. For aging the wine, some modern producers will utilize new French oak barrels but there is a tradition of using large, used oak &quot;botti&quot; barrels that hold five to six hectoliters of wine. Some traditional producers still use the old chestnut barrels in their cellars.

== Wine regions ==
While Sangiovese plantings are found worldwide, the grape&#x27;s homeland is central Italy. From there the grape was taken to North and South America by Italian immigrants. It first achieved some popularity in Argentina where in the Mendoza region it produced wines that had few similarities to its Tuscan counterparts. In California the grape found a sudden surge of popularity in the late 1980s with the &quot;Cal-Ital&quot; movement of winemakers seeking red wine alternatives to the standard French varietals of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Pinot noir.

While there was over of Sangiovese planted in Italy in 1990, plantings of the grape began to decline. However, at the turn of the 21st century, Italy was still the leading source for Sangiovese, with planted in 2000, primarily in the Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna, Sicily, Abruzzo and Marche regions. Argentina was next with , followed by Romania with , the Corsica region in France with , California with and Australia with .

===Italy===
In Italy, Sangiovese is the most widely planted red grape variety. It is an officially recommended variety in 53 provinces and an authorized planting in an additional 13. It accounts for approximately 10% of all vineyard plantings in Italy with more than planted to one of the many clonal variation of the grape. Throughout Italy it is known under a variety of names including &quot;Brunello, Morellino, Nielluccio&quot; and &quot;Prugnolo Gentile&quot;. It is the main grape used in the popular red wines of Tuscany, where it is the solitary grape of Brunello di Montalcino and the primary component of the wines of Chianti, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and many &quot;Super Tuscans&quot;. Outside Tuscany, it is found throughout central Italy where it places an important role in the &quot;Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita&quot; (DOCG) wines of Torgiano Rosso Riserva in Umbria, Conero in Marche and the &quot;Denominazione di Origine Controllata&quot; (DOC) wines of Montefalco Rosso in Umbria and Rosso Piceno in Marche. Significant Sangiovese plantings can also be found outside central Italy in Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Valpolicella and as far south as Campania and Sicily.

The intense fruit and deep color of Cabernet was shown to be well suited for blending with Sangiovese but banned in many Italian DOCs. In the 1970s, the rise of &quot;Super Tuscans&quot;-wines that eschew DOC regulation in favor of the lower classification of &quot;vino da tavola&quot;-increased the demand for more flexibility in the DOC laws. While the first DOC to be permitted to blend Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese was approved for Carmignano in 1975, most of Tuscany&#x27;s premier wine regions were not permitted to blend Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese till the late 20th century.

====Tuscany====

From the early to mid-20th century, the quality of Chianti was in low regard. DOC regulation that stipulate the relatively bland Trebbiano and Malvasia grapes needed to account for at least 10% of the finished blend, with consequent higher acidity and diluted flavours. Some wineries trucked in full bodied and jammy red wines from Sicily and Apulia to add color and alcohol to the blend—an illegal practice that did little to improve the quality of Chianti. From the 1970s through the 1980s, a revolution of sorts spread through Tuscany as the quality of the Sangiovese grape was rediscovered. Winemakers became more ambitious and willing to step outside DOC regulations to make 100% varietal Sangiovese or a &quot;Super Tuscan&quot; blend with Bordeaux varietals like Cabernet and Merlot.

Today there is a broad range of style of Chianti reflecting the Sangiovese influence and winemaker&#x27;s touch. Traditional Sangiovese emphasize herbal and bitter cherry notes, while more modern, Bordeaux-influenced wines have more plum and mulberry fruit with vanilla oak and spice. Stylistic and &quot;terroir&quot; based differences also emerge among the various sub-zones of the Chianti region. The ideal vineyard locations are found on south and southwest-facing slopes at altitudes between . In general, Sangiovese has a more difficult time fully ripening in the Chianti region than it does in the Montalcino and Maremma regions to the south. This is due to cooler nighttime temperatures and high propensity for rainfall in September and October that can affect harvest time.

In the mid-19th century, a local farmer named Clemente Santi isolated certain plantings of Sangiovese vines in order to produce a 100% varietal wine that could be aged for a considerable period of time. In 1888, his grandson Ferruccio Biondi-Santi—a veteran soldier who fought under Giuseppe Garibaldi during the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;—released the first &quot;modern version&quot; of &quot;Brunello di Montalcino&quot;, which was aged for over a decade in large wood barrels. By the mid-20th century, this 100% varietal Sangiovese was eagerly being sought out by critics and wine drinkers alike. The Montalcino region seems to have ideal conditions for ripening Sangiovese with the potential for full ripeness achievable even on north-facing slopes. These slopes tend to produce lighter and more elegant wines that then those made from vineyards on south and southwest facing slopes.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, the Maremma region located in the southwest corner of Tuscany has seen vast expansion and a surge of investment from outside the region. The area is reliably warm with a shorter growing season. Sangiovese grown in the Maremma is capable of developing broad character but does have the potential of developing too much alcohol and not enough aroma compounds.

====Outside Tuscany====

Sangiovese is considered the &quot;workhorse&quot; grape of central Italy, producing everything from everyday drinking to premium wines in a variety of styles-from red still wines, to &quot;rosato&quot; to sweet &quot;passito&quot;, semi-sparkling &quot;frizzante&quot; and the dessert wine Vin Santo. In northern Italy, the grape is a minor variety with it having difficulties ripening north of Emilia-Romagna. In the south, it is mainly used as a blending partner with the region&#x27;s local grapes such as Primitivo, Montepulciano and Nero d&#x27;Avola.

In the Romagna region of Emilia-Romagna, the same grape is called &quot;Sangiovese di Romagna&quot; and is widely planted across the region. Like its neighboring Tuscan brother, Sangiovese di Romagna has shown itself to spring off a variety of clones that can produce a wide range of quality—from very poor to very fine. Viticulturists have worked with Romagna vines to produce new clonal varieties of high quality (most notably the clones R24 &amp; T19).

Sangiovese di Romagna adapts to different soil types, producing richer, more full bodied and tannic wines in the central provinces of Forlì and Ravenna and lighter, fruitier wines in the western and eastern extremes of the regions near the border with Bologna and Marche. The grape seems to produce the highest quality wine in the sandstone and clay rich hills south of the Via Emilia near the Apennines which is covered by much of the Sangiovese di Romagna DOC zone. The higher summer time temperatures of this area gives more opportunity for Sangiovese to sufficiently ripen.
The Sangiovese di Romagna DOC zone includes over of Sangiovese that produces on average 3.4 million U.S. gallons (130,000 hl) of wine a year.

===Other Old World wine regions===
In France, while some producers in the Languedoc are now experimenting with the variety, Sangiovese has a long history on the island of Corsica where it is known as &quot;Nielluccio&quot;. The grape was likely brought to the island sometime between 14th and 18th century when it was ruled by the Republic of Genoa. Here it is often blended with Sciaccarello and is a permitted grape in several &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC)s, most notable in Patrimonio, where it is used for both red and &quot;rosé&quot; wine production. In 2008, there were of Sangiovese/Nielluccio on Corsica.

In Greece, producers in the northeastern wine region of Drama in East Macedonia and Thrace are experimenting with oak-aged &quot;Super Tuscan&quot; style blends of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. Additional plantings of Sangiovese can be found in Israel, Malta, Turkey and Switzerland.

===United States and Canada===

Italian immigrants brought Sangiovese to California in the late 19th century, possibly at the Seghesio Family&#x27;s &quot;Chianti Station,&quot; near Geyserville. But it was never considered very important until the success of the Super Tuscans in the 1980s spurred new interest in the grape. In 1991, there were nearly planted with Sangiovese. By 2003, that number rose to nearly with plantings across the state, most notably in Napa Valley, Sonoma county, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and the Sierra Foothills. However, in recent years plantings of the variety have declined to by 2010.

Early results in the late 20th century, were not very promising for California winemakers. Poor site and clonal selection had the grape planted in vineyards that gave it too much exposure to the sun, producing wines that had little in common with the wines of Tuscany. The Antinori family, which once owned Atlas Peak Vineyards located in the Atlas Peak AVA in the foothills of Napa Valley found that the greater intensity of sunlight in California may have been one possible factor for the poorer quality. Today the style of these Californian Sangiovese tend to be more fruit-driven than their Tuscan counterparts with some floral notes. Recent years have focused on improving vineyard site and clonal selection as well as giving the vines time to age and develop in quality.
In Washington State, one of the first commercial plantings of Sangiovese was at Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA. Today, winemakers are seeking out locations that can highlight the varietal character of Sangiovese. These young plantings in areas such as Walla Walla, Naches Heights AVA and Yakima Valley have so far produced wines with a spicy and tart cherry flavours, anise, red currants, and tobacco leaf notes. Like in California, plantings of Sangiovese in Washington have declined in recent years to in 2011.

Other areas in the United States with sizable plantings of Sangiovese include the Rogue Valley and Umpqua AVA in Oregon, the Monticello in Virginia, the Sonoita AVA with 45 acres planted in Arizona, and Texas Hill Country in Texas.

In Canada, there are less than of Sangiovese planted, mostly in Ontario where some producers in Niagara-on-the-Lake are experimenting with ice wine versions of the grape. A small amount of the grape can also be found in British Columbia.

===Other New World regions===

Italian immigrants introduced the Sangiovese vine to Argentina in the late 19th and early 20th century. Early site and clonal selection was less than ideal and, like California and Australia, recent endeavors have focused on finding the best clones to use and the right vineyard locations. The grape is not widely planted in Argentina and the focus is mostly on the export market. In 2008 there were of Sangiovese planted, most of it in the Mendoza wine region with other isolated plantings in La Rioja and San Juan.

Across the Andes range, Chilean winemakers have been experimenting with plantings with in 2008. Brazil reported of Sangiovese in 2007. The growing Mexican wine industry has also recently begun planting the vine.

Sangiovese is becoming increasingly popular as a red wine grape in Australia, having been introduced by the CSIRO in the late 1960s. For many years, this single clone (H6V9) imported from the University of California-Davis was the only available clone for Australian winemakers. The first large-scale commercial planting of the grape was in the 1980s when Penfolds expanded their Kalimna vineyard in the Barossa Valley. As the availability of clones expanded (currently 10 available commercially as of 2011), so did plantings of Sangiovese with in 2008.

As in California, Australian winemakers have begun seeking out the best vineyard location for the grape and being more selective in which clones are planted. Some regions that have shown promise for the grape include the Karridale and Margaret River areas of Western Australia; Langhorne Creek
, Strathalbyn and Port Lincoln in South Australia; Canberra and Young in New South Wales; Stanthorpe in Queensland and the western edge of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria.

In New Zealand, the first varietal version of Sangiovese was released in 1998 and today there are of the grape planted, mostly on the North Island around Auckland.

A small amount of Sangiovese is grown in South Africa with reported in 2008, mostly in the Stellenbosch and Darling regions. About 10 wineries make Sangiovese

== Wines ==

Wines made from Sangiovese tend to exhibit the grape&#x27;s naturally high acidity as well as moderate to high tannin content and light color. Blending can have a pronounced effect on enhancing or tempering the wine&#x27;s quality. The dominant nature of Cabernet can sometimes have a disproportionate influence on the wine, even overwhelming Sangiovese character with black cherry, black currant, mulberry and plum fruit. Even percentages as low as 4 to 5% of Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm the Sangiovese if the fruit quality is not high. As the wine ages, some of these Cabernet dominant flavours can soften and reveal more Sangiovese character.

Different regions will impart varietal character on the wine with Tuscan Sangiovese having a distinctive bitter-sweet component of cherry, violets and tea. In their youth, Tuscan Sangiovese can have tomato-savoriness to it that enhances its herbal component. Californian examples tend to have more bright, red fruit flavours with some Zinfandel-like spice or darker fruits depending on the proportion of Cabernet blended in. Argentine examples showing a hybrid between the Tuscan and California Sangiovese with juicy red fruit wines that end on a bitter cherry note.

Sangiovese based wines have the potential to age but the vast majority of Sangiovese wines are intended to be consumed relatively early in their lives. The wines with the longest aging potential are the Super Tuscans and Brunello di Montalcino wines that can age for upwards of 20 years in ideal vintages. These premium examples may need 5 to 10 years to develop before they drink well. The potentially lighter Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Carmignano and Rosso di Montalcino tend to open earlier (around 5 years of age) but have a shorter life span of 8 to 10 years. The aging potential of Chianti is highly variable, depending on the producer, vintage and sub-zone of the Chianti region it is produced in. Basic Chianti is meant to be consumed within 3 to 4 years after vintage while top examples of Chianti Classico Riserva can last for upwards of 15 years. New World Sangiovese has so far, shown a relatively short window of drinkability with most examples best consumed with 3 to 4 years after harvest with some basic examples of Argentine Sangiovese having the potential to only improve for a year after bottling.

==With food==
Sangiovese&#x27;s high acidity and moderate alcohol makes it a very food-friendly wine when it comes to food and wine pairings. One of the classic pairings in Italian cuisine is tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces with a Sangiovese-based Chianti. Varietal Sangiovese or those with a smaller proportion of the powerful, full-bodied Cabernet blended in, can accentuate the flavours of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf and roast chicken. Herb seasoning such as basil, thyme and sage play off the herbal notes of the grapes. Sangiovese that has been subject to more aggressive oak treatment pairs well with grilled and smoked food. If Cabernet, Merlot or Syrah plays a dominant role, the food pairing option should treat the Sangiovese blend as one of those fuller-bodied reds and pair with heavier dishes such as steak and thick soups like &quot;ribollita&quot; and puréed bean soup.

==Synonyms==
Over the years, Sangiovese has been known under a variety of synonyms, many of which have come to be associated with a particular clone of the grape variety. Among the synonyms recognized for the grape are: Brunelletto (in the Grosseto region of Tuscany), Brunello, Brunello di Montalcino, Cacchiano (in Tuscany), Calabrese (in Tuscany), Cardisco, Chiantino (in Tuscany), Cordisio, Corinto nero (on the island of Lipari in Sicily), Dolcetto Precoce, Guarnacciola (in the Benevento region of Campania), Ingannacane, Lambrusco Mendoza (in Tuscany), Maglioppa, Montepulciano, Morellino, Morellone, Negrello (in Calabria), Negretta, Nerello (in Sicily), Nerello Campotu (in Calabria), Nerino, Niella (in Corsica), Nielluccia, Nielluccio (in Corsica), Pigniuolo Rosso, Pignolo, Plant Romain, Primaticcio, Prugnolo, Prugnolo Dolce (in Tuscany), Prugnolo di Montepulciano, Prugnolo Gentile, Prugnolo Gentile di Montepulciano, Puttanella (in Calabria), Riminese, Rosso di Montalcino, San Gioveto, San Zoveto (in Tuscany), Sancivetro, Sangineto, Sangiogheto (in Tuscany), Sangiovese dal Cannello Lungo, Sangiovese di Lamole, Sangiovese di Romagna, Sangiovese Dolce, Sangiovese Gentile, Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese Nostrano, Sangiovese Piccolo, Sangiovese Toscano, Sangioveto (in Tuscany), Sangioveto dell&#x27;Elba, Sangioveto Dolce, Sangioveto Grosso, Sangioveto Montanino, Sanvincetro, Sanzoveto, Tabernello, Tignolo, Tipsa, Toustain (in Algeria), Tuccanese (in Apulia), Uva Abruzzi, Uva Tosca, Uvetta, Uva brunella, Uva Canina, Vigna del Conte (in Calabria) and Vigna Maggio (in Tuscany).

<text>Dino Kartsonakis (born July 20, 1942) is an American pianist of Greek heritage. He is known for his arrangements of religious music for the piano.

==Biography==
Dino was born in New York City and attended Glad Tidings Tabernacle. He began playing his grandmother&#x27;s piano at the age of three. The first song he learned was &quot;At the Cross&quot;. He enrolled in piano lessons at age five and developed a love and passion for playing the piano. This love and passion was cultivated as a young boy at his home church, Glad Tidings Tabernacle in New York City where for a time, Dino served as Music Director and Pianist. Dino would go on to receive more formal musical training at The King&#x27;s College as well as the Juilliard School of Music. Dino served in the U.S. Army in the mid-1960’s with an overseas assignment n Germany. After military service, Dino performed in the early 70’s as pianist for evangelist Kathryn Kuhlman, but was dismissed from the ministry over contracts disputes along with his brother-in-law, Paul J. Bartholomew.

Dino has traveled extensively across the globe and has produced well over 50 recordings on his own as well as mainstream labels. He has worked with other various evangelists over the decades, notably Paul Crouch of Trinity Broadcasting Network and former PTL leaders, Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker.

Dino has hosted two television shows over the years: the &quot;Dino and Debby Show&quot; in the 1970s with his first wife Deborah Keener, and &quot;The Dino Show&quot; which aired on the former Trinity Broadcasting Network. Dino describes his style as combining the classical with the sacred. His technique has been described as fluid and brilliant and he has been termed the &quot;Christian Liberace&quot; because of his flair, designer costumes, custom pianos and flashy jewelry.

Many of Dino’s works are religious-based, along with secular and contemporary arrangements of classical works. Dino performed for 18 years in his own show in Branson, Missouri. Among his accomplishments remains his &quot;Peace Series” - a collection of CDs featuring subdued piano arrangements against a backdrop of nature sounds. Today, Dino and his wife reside in Branson, Missouri. He maintains a regular presence on Facebook, selling his CD’s and music books while occasionally performing piano concerts at churches. 

Dino performed at Carnegie Hall on December 15, 2005. He participated in an auction benefiting Music Cares, a charitable organization that helps struggling musicians and entertainers.

Dino was nominated and received a Grammy Award in 1998 for his work on the soundtrack of the movie The Apostle.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Dino married his first wife, Grammy Award nominee Deborah Keener, and together they have a daughter, Christina (who is an accomplished performer, composer, songwriter, producer and has conducted at Carnegie Hall). After touring as Dino &amp; Debby, the two divorced in 1981. In 1986, Dino married his second and current wife, Cheryl, who is the sister of the late pastor and Gospel music singer, Gary McSpadden, formerly of The Imperials and the Gaither Vocal Band. Cheryl has a daughter, Cheri, from her first marriage to the late Gospel singer Jack Toney, former lead singer of The Statesmen Quartet. 

In 2007 Dino and Cheryl opened a bakery in Branson, MO called Dino&#x27;s Cake &amp; Coffee Co. (formerly Dino&#x27;s 24 Karrot Cake Company). Dino remarked that baking was his passion second only to performing his music. They were a major supplier to the Neiman Marcus stores and cafés In the early 2000’s.

In 2011, Dino and his wife Cheryl lost their home during a flood in the Branson, Missouri area. Dino lost most of his professional possessions such as his grand pianos as well as all of his costumes, industry memorabilia and awards. The Kartsonakis&#x27; then started helping the community by doing fundraising concerts to help other victims rebuild their lives and homes.

<text>The M79 Osa (from ) is a Yugoslav-made portable 90 mm anti-tank weapon made of fibre-reinforced plastics. It resembles the French portable anti-tank launcher 89 mm LRAC F1. It consists of the launcher, a CN-6 sighting piece, rocket and carrying case for the rocket. The M79 shoots unguided projectiles in direct sight and is effective against armoured fighting vehicles and fortifications.

==Operation==
The M79 Osa is operated by a two-man team, an operator and a loader. The loader inserts the rocket container through the rear of the launcher. The operator then takes aim at the target through the CN-6 sight. The CN-6 sight has 3.5x magnification and a 10 degree field of view. It also features anti-laser filters to protect the operator from blinding battlefield lasers. When the trigger is pressed, the rocket motor is fired electronically. The rocket leaves the launcher at a speed of approximately 250 meters per second. It is accurate enough to be used against armoured vehicles at a range of 350 meters, and can engage larger stationary targets up to 600 meters away.

On impact a piezoelectric impact fuse in the rocket triggers the shaped charge warhead, which can penetrate up to 400 millimeters of armour. The fuse is sensitive enough to trigger the warhead at impact angles up to 70 degrees from the vertical. After firing, the spent rocket container is removed from the launcher, and a fresh tube is attached.

== Operational history ==
The M79 Osa was designed and manufactured by Sloboda in the former Yugoslavia. It has continued production in Serbia, North Macedonia, and in Croatia (as the RL90 M95).

A large number of M79 OSA rocket launchers were supplied to rebels in Syria which proved effective in deterring the Syrian Army&#x27;s armor. Many mistook the M79 supplied to the rebels in Syria for the Russian RPG-29 rocket launcher, which also saw use. M79 Osas were also used in Iraq by Islamic State against Iraqi army and JANES reported their use against US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks.

In September 2014, the Houthi movement seized Sanaa, the capital city of Yemen, and in March 2015 the Saudi coalition launched an all out war on them all over Yemen. A large stockpile of M79 Osa rocket launchers and rockets were found in Yemeni military weapons depots. All sides of the conflict have used the M79 since 2015.

<doc id="628183" wikidata="Q1153441" url="?curid=628183" title="Goldstone boson">
<text>In particle and condensed matter physics, Goldstone bosons or Nambu–Goldstone bosons (NGBs) are bosons that appear necessarily in models exhibiting spontaneous breakdown of continuous symmetries. They were discovered by Yoichiro Nambu in particle physics within the context of the BCS superconductivity mechanism, and subsequently elucidated by Jeffrey Goldstone, and systematically generalized in the context of quantum field theory. In condensed matter physics such bosons are quasiparticles and are known as Anderson–Bogoliubov modes.

These spinless bosons correspond to the spontaneously broken internal symmetry generators, and are characterized by the quantum numbers of these.
They transform nonlinearly (shift) under the action of these generators, and can thus be excited out of the asymmetric vacuum by these generators. Thus, they can be thought of as the excitations of the field in the broken symmetry directions in group space—and are massless if the spontaneously broken symmetry is not also broken explicitly.

If, instead, the symmetry is not exact, i.e. if it is explicitly broken as well as spontaneously broken, then the Nambu–Goldstone bosons are not massless, though they typically remain relatively light; they are then called [[Chiral symmetry breaking|pseudo-Goldstone boson]]s or pseudo–Nambu–Goldstone bosons (abbreviated PNGBs).

==Goldstone&#x27;s theorem==

Goldstone&#x27;s theorem examines a generic continuous symmetry which is spontaneously broken; i.e., its currents are conserved, but the ground state is not invariant under the action of the corresponding charges. Then, necessarily, new massless (or light, if the symmetry is not exact) scalar particles appear in the spectrum of possible excitations. There is one scalar particle—called a Nambu–Goldstone boson—for each generator of the symmetry that is broken, i.e., that does not preserve the ground state. The Nambu–Goldstone mode is a long-wavelength fluctuation of the corresponding order parameter.

By virtue of their special properties in coupling to the vacuum of the respective symmetry-broken theory, vanishing momentum (&quot;soft&quot;) Goldstone bosons involved in field-theoretic amplitudes make such amplitudes vanish (&quot;Adler zeros&quot;).

==Examples==

===Natural===

*In fluids, the phonon is longitudinal and it is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken Galilean symmetry. In solids, the situation is more complicated; the Goldstone bosons are the longitudinal and transverse phonons and they happen to be the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken Galilean, translational, and rotational symmetry with no simple one-to-one correspondence between the Goldstone modes and the broken symmetries.
*In magnets, the original rotational symmetry (present in the absence of an external magnetic field) is spontaneously broken such that the magnetization points in a specific direction. The Goldstone bosons then are the &quot;magnons&quot;, i.e., spin waves in which the local magnetization direction oscillates.
*The &quot;pions&quot; are the pseudo-Goldstone bosons that result from the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral-flavor symmetries of QCD effected by quark condensation due to the strong interaction. These symmetries are further explicitly broken by the masses of the quarks so that the pions are not massless, but their mass is &quot;significantly smaller&quot; than typical hadron masses.
*The longitudinal polarization components of the W and Z bosons correspond to the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken part of the electroweak symmetry SU(2)⊗U(1), which, however, are not observable. Because this symmetry is gauged, the three would-be Goldstone bosons are absorbed by the three gauge bosons corresponding to the three broken generators; this gives these three gauge bosons a mass and the associated necessary third polarization degree of freedom. This is described in the Standard Model through the Higgs mechanism. An analogous phenomenon occurs in superconductivity, which served as the original source of inspiration for Nambu, namely, the photon develops a dynamical mass (expressed as magnetic flux exclusion from a superconductor), cf. the Ginzburg–Landau theory.
* Primordial fluctuations during inflation can be viewed as Goldstone bosons arising due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of time translation symmetry of a de Sitter universe. These fluctuations in the inflaton scalar field subsequently seed cosmic structure formation.
* Ricciardi and Umezawa proposed in 1967 a general theory (quantum brain) about the possible brain mechanism of memory storage and retrieval in terms of Nambu–Goldstone bosons. This theory was subsequently extended in 1995 by Giuseppe Vitiello taking into account that the brain is an &quot;open&quot; system (the dissipative quantum model of the brain). Applications of spontaneous symmetry breaking and of Goldstone&#x27;s theorem to biological systems, in general, have been published by E. Del Giudice, S. Doglia, M. Milani, and G. Vitiello, and by E. Del Giudice, G. Preparata and G. Vitiello. Mari Jibu and Kunio Yasue and Giuseppe Vitiello, based on these findings, discussed the implications for consciousness.

===Theory===
Consider a complex scalar field , with the constraint that formula_1, a constant. One way to impose a constraint of this sort is by including a potential interaction term in its Lagrangian density, 
:formula_2
and taking the limit as . This is called the &quot;Abelian nonlinear σ-model&quot;.

The constraint, and the action, below, are invariant under a &quot;U&quot;(1) phase transformation, . The field can be redefined to give a real scalar field (i.e., a spin-zero particle) without any constraint by
:formula_3
where is the Nambu–Goldstone boson (actually formula_4 is) and the &quot;U&quot;(1) symmetry transformation effects a shift on , namely 
:formula_5 
but does not preserve the ground state (i.e. the above infinitesimal transformation &quot;does not annihilate it&quot;—the hallmark of invariance), as evident in the charge of the current below.

Thus, the vacuum is degenerate and noninvariant under the action of the spontaneously broken symmetry.

The corresponding Lagrangian density is given by
:formula_6
and thus 
::formula_7
Note that the constant term formula_8 in the Lagrangian density has no physical significance, and the other term in it is simply the kinetic term for a massless scalar.

The symmetry-induced conserved &quot;U&quot;(1) current is 
:formula_9 
The charge, &quot;Q&quot;, resulting from this current shifts and the ground state to a new, degenerate, ground state. Thus, a vacuum with will shift to a &quot;different vacuum&quot; with . The current connects the original vacuum with the Nambu–Goldstone boson state, .

In general, in a theory with several scalar fields, , the Nambu–Goldstone mode is massless, and parameterises the curve of possible (degenerate) vacuum states. Its hallmark under the broken symmetry transformation is &quot;nonvanishing vacuum expectation&quot; , an order parameter, for vanishing , at some ground state |0〉 chosen at the minimum of the potential, . In principle the vacuum should be the minimum of the effective potential which takes into account quantum effects, however it is equal to the classical potential to first approximation. Symmetry dictates that all variations of the potential with respect to the fields in all symmetry directions vanish. The vacuum value of the first order variation in any direction vanishes as just seen; while the vacuum value of the second order variation must also vanish, as follows. Vanishing vacuum values of field symmetry transformation increments add no new information.

By contrast, however, &quot;nonvanishing vacuum expectations of transformation increments&quot;, , specify the relevant (Goldstone) &quot;null eigenvectors of the mass matrix&quot;,

and hence the corresponding zero-mass eigenvalues.

== Goldstone&#x27;s argument ==
The principle behind Goldstone&#x27;s argument is that the ground state is not unique. Normally, by current conservation, the charge operator for any symmetry current is time-independent,
:formula_10

Acting with the charge operator on the vacuum either &quot;annihilates the vacuum&quot;, if that is symmetric; else, if &quot;not&quot;, as is the case in spontaneous symmetry breaking, it produces a zero-frequency state out of it, through its shift transformation feature illustrated above. Actually, here, the charge itself is ill-defined, cf. the Fabri–Picasso argument below.

But its better behaved commutators with fields, that is, the nonvanishing transformation shifts , are, nevertheless, &quot;time-invariant&quot;, 
:formula_11
thus generating a in its Fourier transform. (This ensures that, inserting a complete set of intermediate states in a nonvanishing current commutator can lead to vanishing time-evolution only when one or more of these states is massless.)

Thus, if the vacuum is not invariant under the symmetry, action of the charge operator produces a state which is different from the vacuum chosen, but which has zero frequency. This is a long-wavelength oscillation of a field which is nearly stationary: there are physical states with zero frequency, , so that the theory cannot have a mass gap.

This argument is further clarified by taking the limit carefully. If an approximate charge operator acting in a huge but finite region is applied to the vacuum,
:formula_12

a state with approximately vanishing time derivative is produced,
:formula_13

Assuming a nonvanishing mass gap , the frequency of any state like the above, which is orthogonal to the vacuum, is at least ,
:formula_14

Letting become large leads to a contradiction. Consequently 0 = 0. However this argument fails when the symmetry is gauged, because then the symmetry generator is only performing a gauge transformation. A gauge transformed state is the same exact state, so that acting with a symmetry generator does not get one out of the vacuum (see Higgs mechanism).
:Fabri–Picasso Theorem. does not properly exist in the Hilbert space, unless .

The argument requires both the vacuum and the charge to be translationally invariant, , .

Consider the correlation function of the charge with itself,
:formula_15
so the integrand in the right hand side does not depend on the position.

Thus, its value is proportional to the total space volume, formula_16 — unless the symmetry is unbroken, . Consequently, does not properly exist in the Hilbert space.

== Infraparticles ==
There is an arguable loophole in the theorem. If one reads the theorem carefully, it only states that there exist non-vacuum states with arbitrarily small energies. Take for example a chiral N = 1 super QCD model with a nonzero squark VEV which is conformal in the IR. The chiral symmetry is a global symmetry which is (partially) spontaneously broken. Some of the &quot;Goldstone bosons&quot; associated with this spontaneous symmetry breaking are charged under the unbroken gauge group and hence, these composite bosons have a continuous mass spectrum with arbitrarily small masses but yet there is no Goldstone boson with exactly zero mass. In other words, the Goldstone bosons are infraparticles.

== Extensions ==

=== Nonrelativistic theories ===

A version of Goldstone&#x27;s theorem also applies to nonrelativistic theories. It essentially states that, for each spontaneously broken symmetry, there corresponds some quasiparticle which is typically a boson and has no energy gap. In condensed matter these goldstone bosons are also called gapless modes (i.e. states where the energy dispersion relation is like formula_17 and is zero for formula_18), the nonrelativistic version of the massless particles (i.e. photons where the dispersion relation is also formula_19 and zero for formula_18). Note that the energy in the non relativistic condensed matter case is and not as it would be in a relativistic case. However, two &quot;different&quot; spontaneously broken generators may now give rise to the &quot;same&quot; Nambu–Goldstone boson.

As a first example an antiferromagnet has 2 goldstone bosons, a ferromagnet has 1 goldstone bosons, where in both cases we are breaking symmetry from SO(3) to SO(2), for the antiferromagnet the dispersion is formula_21 and the expectation value of the ground state is zero, for the ferromagnet instead the dispersion is formula_22 and the expectation value of the ground state is not zero, i.e. there is a spontaneously broken symmetry for the ground state 

As a second example, in a superfluid, both the &quot;U(1)&quot; particle number symmetry and Galilean symmetry are spontaneously broken. However, the phonon is the Goldstone boson for both.

Still in regards to symmetry breaking there is also a close analogy between gapless modes in condensed matter and the Higgs boson, e.g. in the paramagnet to ferromagnet phase transition

=== Breaking of spacetime symmetries ===

In contrast to the case of the breaking of internal symmetries, when spacetime symmetries such as Lorentz, conformal, rotational, or translational symmetries are broken, the order parameter need not be a scalar field, but may be a tensor field, and the number of independent massless modes may be fewer than the number of spontaneously broken generators. For a theory with an order parameter formula_23 that spontaneously breaks a spacetime symmetry, the number of broken generators formula_24 minus the number non-trivial independent solutions formula_25 to

:formula_26

is the number of Goldstone modes that arise. For internal symmetries, the above equation has no non-trivial solutions, so the usual Goldstone theorem holds. When solutions do exist, this is because the Goldstone modes are linearly dependent among themselves, in that the resulting mode can be expressed as a gradients of another mode. Since the spacetime dependence of the solutions formula_25 is in the direction of the unbroken generators, when all translation generators are broken, no non-trivial solutions exist and the number of Goldstone modes is once again exactly the number of broken generators.

In general, the phonon is effectively the Nambu–Goldstone boson for spontaneously broken translation symmetry.

== Nambu–Goldstone fermions ==

Spontaneously broken global fermionic symmetries, which occur in some supersymmetric models, lead to Nambu–Goldstone fermions, or &quot;goldstinos&quot;. These have spin , instead of 0, and carry all quantum numbers of the respective supersymmetry generators broken spontaneously.

Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking smashes up (&quot;reduces&quot;) supermultiplet structures into the characteristic nonlinear realizations of broken supersymmetry, so that goldstinos are superpartners of &quot;all&quot; particles in the theory, of &quot;any spin&quot;, and the only superpartners, at that. That is, to say, two non-goldstino particles are connected to only goldstinos through supersymmetry transformations, and not to each other, even if they were so connected before the breaking of supersymmetry. As a result, the masses and spin multiplicities of such particles are then arbitrary.

<doc id="628193" wikidata="Q1758905" url="?curid=628193" title="Tasty (Kelis album)">
<text>Tasty is the third studio album by American singer Kelis, released on December 5, 2003, by Star Trak Entertainment and Arista Records. As executive producer, Kelis enlisted previous collaborators the Neptunes to produce the album, as well as new collaborators such as Raphael Saadiq, Dallas Austin, André 3000, Rockwilder, and Dame Blackmon &quot;Grease&quot;. It also features guest vocals from Saadiq, André 3000, and then-boyfriend Nas.

The album was met with positive reviews from critics, who praised its originality and viewed it as an improvement on Kelis&#x27; previous albums, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1999) and &quot;Wanderland&quot; (2001). &quot;Tasty&quot; debuted at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 93,600 copies, earning Kelis the best sales week of her career in the United States. The album also became her highest-peaking album in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 11 on the UK Albums Chart. It spawned four singles: &quot;Milkshake&quot;, &quot;Trick Me&quot;, &quot;Millionaire&quot;, and &quot;In Public&quot;.

One of the Neptunes-produced tracks on the album, &quot;Flashback&quot;, was originally included on &quot;Wanderland&quot;, which was not initially released in North America upon release.

==Singles==
&quot;Milkshake&quot; was released on August 25, 2003, as the lead single from &quot;Tasty&quot;. It reached number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Kelis&#x27; highest-peaking single on the chart to date. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 25, 2004, and has sold 883,000 digital downloads in the United States. &quot;Milkshake&quot; also achieved commercial success internationally, reaching number one on the Irish Singles Chart and number two on the UK Singles Chart, as well as peaking inside the top five in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance in 2004.

&quot;Trick Me&quot; was released on February 17, 2004, as the second single from the album. The track was successful in Europe and Oceania; it peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, while charting inside the top five in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and Norway, and the top 10 in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland.

&quot;Millionaire&quot;, which features André 3000, was released as the album&#x27;s third single on October 18, 2004. The song peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the album&#x27;s third consecutive top-three entry. &quot;Millionaire&quot; attained modest success elsewhere, reaching number 11 in Finland, number 23 in Australia, and number 27 in New Zealand.

The album&#x27;s fourth and final single, &quot;In Public&quot;, features Nas and was released on April 4, 2005. The song reached number 17 on the UK chart and number 22 on the Irish chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Tasty&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on 18 reviews. Andy Kellman of AllMusic stated, &quot;Despite all the new assistance, &quot;Tasty&quot; is formatted much like &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; and &quot;Wanderland&quot;, constantly swinging back and forth between bouncy pop and laid-back (not throwback) soul.&quot; Ernest Hardy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised &quot;Tasty&quot; as Kelis&#x27; &quot;best work&quot; and wrote, &quot;Take away the Dallas Austin-produced tracks [...], two Neptunes rock attempts and &#x27;Milkshake&#x27;, and you have a solid R&amp;B album, one that&#x27;s thickly speckled with hip-hop influences and nods to early Prince and Eighties Latin freestyle music.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Neil Drumming described the album as &quot;Kelis&#x27; past—big beats, out-there imagery, and sex appeal—refined&quot; and commented that &quot;much of the beauty of &quot;Tasty&quot; is in witnessing Kelis rise to the challenge of working with multiple imaginative maestros.&quot; In a review for &quot;NME&quot;, Tony Naylor found the album to be &quot;[f]ar more complete than &quot;Wanderland&quot; or &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;&quot;, adding that &quot;such vacuum-packed musical freshness is maintained throughout.&quot;

Dorian Lynskey of &quot;The Guardian&quot; dubbed Kelis a &quot;parallel universe Beyoncé&quot; and wrote that she &quot;exploits her husky croon like never before, pouring it over lascivious double entendre [...] and, well, lascivious single entrendre&quot;, concluding, &quot;She may not be R&amp;B&#x27;s biggest star, but Kelis remains its most compelling character.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; noted that she &quot;certainly takes the sexual initiative in several songs&quot;, but &quot;[m]ostly, though, Kelis keeps a watchful eye on her affections in songs such as &#x27;Protect My Heart&#x27; and &#x27;Trick Me&#x27;, and has developed a decidedly jaundiced view of hip hop&#x27;s lop-sided sexual politics, judging by &#x27;Keep It Down&#x27;.&quot; Joseph Patel of &quot;Blender&quot; commented that Kelis is &quot;as good playing a hair-twisting, gum-popping tart on &#x27;Sugar Honey Iced Tea&#x27; as an all-grown-up cock-blocker on the crackling funk ditty &#x27;Trick Me&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; reviewer Sal Cinquemani felt that few of the tracks on the album are &quot;as immediately thirst-quenching as the insta-classic lead single &#x27;Milkshake&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Scott Plagenhoef opined that &quot;Tasty&quot; is &quot;far from all &quot;. Adam Webb of Yahoo! Music expressed that the album is &quot;not as far out wild as &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; but it is a consistently inventive and brilliant record.&quot; Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; viewed that, &quot;guests and idiosyncrasies aside, her honeyed voice is the most important ingredient. It&#x27;s sweet enough to make you wonder, &#x27;Did she just say that?&#x27; No one could ever accuse her of being bland.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Tasty&quot; debuted at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 93,600 copies sold in its first week; it gave Kelis the best chart week of her career, and became her second highest-peaking album to date, after &quot;Kelis Was Here&quot; (2006). The album was certified gold by the RIAA on February 6, 2004, and had sold 535,000 copies in the United States as of December 2009.

The album debuted at number 53 on the UK Albums Chart, climbing to number 21 the following week. In its third week on the chart, the album rose to its peak position of number 11, becoming Kelis&#x27; highest-charting album in the UK to date. &quot;Tasty&quot; was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on October 22, 2004, and by April 2014, it had sold 476,034 copies in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="628198" wikidata="Q3843623" url="?curid=628198" title="Majoron">
<text>In particle physics, majorons (named after Ettore Majorana) are a hypothetical type of Goldstone boson that are conjectured to mediate the neutrino mass violation of lepton number or &quot;B&quot; − &quot;L&quot; in certain high energy collisions such as

Where two electrons collide to form two W bosons and the majoron J. The U(1)B–L symmetry is assumed to be global so that the majoron is not &quot;eaten up&quot; by the gauge boson and spontaneously broken. Majorons were originally formulated in four dimensions by Yuichi Chikashige, Rabindra Mohapatra and Roberto Peccei to understand neutrino masses by the seesaw mechanism and are being searched for in the neutrino-less double beta decay process. The name majoron was suggested by Graciela Gelmini as a derivative of the last name Majorana with the suffix -on typical of particle names like electron, proton, neutron, etc. There are theoretical extensions of this idea into supersymmetric theories and theories involving extra compactified dimensions. By propagating through the extra spatial dimensions the detectable number of majoron creation events vary accordingly. Mathematically, majorons may be modeled by allowing them to propagate through a material while all other Standard Model forces are fixed to an orbifold point.

== Searches ==
Experiments studying double beta decay have set limits on decay modes that emit majorons.

NEMO has observed a variety of elements. EXO and Kamland-Zen have set half-life limits for majoron decays in xenon.

<text>Samuel Perry Jacks (April 23, 1915 – May 14, 1975) more commonly known as, &quot;Sam Jacks,&quot; was a Canadian soldier in World War II, inventor, military and civic recreation director, sports coach, creator of the Canadian sport of ringette for girls and the creator and codifier of the first set of rules for floor hockey in 1936. He was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1915 and became a Canadian citizen after his parents had immigrated to Canada in 1920. Jacks died from cancer in 1975, at the age of 60.

Among his many achievements and honours was his posthumous induction into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. He was also posthumously inducted into the North Bay Sports Hall of Fame on February 27, 1982. He was inducted into the Ringette Canada Hall of Fame in 1998 during the 10th annual Canadian Ringette Championships.

Jacks is best known for inventing the sport of ringette, although he died before it gained popularity. For the World Ringette Championships, the Sam Jacks Trophy, which is given to the winning team in the senior division of what is customarily a three-game series between Team Canada and Team Finland known as the &quot;Sam Jacks Series,&quot; is the highest international trophy in the sport and is named in his honour. In a similar fashion, Ringette Canada honoured Jacks by naming its &quot;Belle&quot; division championship trophy for the Canadian Ringette Championships in his honour, the &quot;Sam Jacks Memorial Trophy.&quot; Today the &quot;Belle&quot; division is known as the Under-19 (U19) division. The Sam Jacks Trophy for the Under-14 AA (U14AA) winners of the Eastern Canadian Ringette Championships is named after him as well, a trophy that was donated by his wife, Agnes Jacks .

At the time of his death in 1975, Jacks had reportedly been working on another game for girls during his spare time, which he called &quot;Net Ball.&quot; It is possible that the game was related to or actually was the organized sport of netball, which had been introduced to Canada during the early 1960s.

==Biography==

Samuel Perry Jacks was born April 23, 1915, in Glasgow, Scotland, less than a year after the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. The war would end in November 1918. In 1920, when Jacks was roughly five years old, he and his family moved from Scotland, immigrated to Canada, and settled in Toronto.
In 1935, Jacks was 20 when he began his professional career in recreation becoming the Assistant Physical Director at the Toronto West End YMCA (Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association).
 The West End YMCA moved to its present West End branch at College Street and Dovercourt Road in 1912, now in Toronto. Jacks would hold that position until 1940, a year after the outbreak of World War II in 1939.

In 1936, while in his early twenties and a year after he had begun his professional career at the YMCA, he invented and codified the first set of rules for the first organized version of floor hockey. The game was designed for youths to play in a gym and was a variant of hockey that used a straight stick and a felt disk with a hole in the middle. The achievement was later recognized by the Youth Branch of the United Nations.
After the outbreak of World War II, Jacks enlisted and became a member of the Canadian Armed Forces serving from 1940 to 1945. During his time with the Canadian military he served with the #1 Motor Transport Volunteer Reserve Depot, 1st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Chemical Warfare School, and served with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion in charge of sports for South West England. On September 30, 1945, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was officially disbanded after it had returned to Canada and hostilities in Europe had ceased.

While stationed in England during World War II, Jacks met Agnes MacKrell (1924–2005) at a dance while he was a recreation director in the army. Agnes Jacks was born in Scotland and her family moved to London, England, just before the outbreak of World War II. Agnes had been working at a munitions factory in England when she and Sam met toward the end of the war while Sam was finishing six years of having served with the Canadian Armed Forces. The couple then married and Agnes automatically became a Canadian citizen. After the war the couple arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, then moved to Toronto, Canada with their first son, Barry. They later had two more sons in Canada, Bruce and Brian. Agnes was a war bride. After Sam died in 1975, Agnes became an important lifelong and committed ambassador for the sport of ringette, which Sam had created in 1963. In 1996 she was inducted into the Ringette Canada Hall of Fame as a &quot;Builder&quot; for her commitment and ambassadorship for the sport of ringette. On Saturday, October 26, 2002, she was inducted as a member of the Order of Canada and was also recognized with the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal for her contributions to women&#x27;s sport. For a time she served as the Honorary President of the International Ringette Federation. She died of heart failure on April 1, 2005, at the North Bay General Hospital at the age of 81.

In 1946, Jacks returned to the West End YMCA in Toronto to continue his professional career. Among his numerous duties part of his time was spent working with postwar juvenile &quot;gangs.&quot; He also created the Toronto Boy&#x27;s Club and became its first president. In 1947, Jacks became the head coach of the Canadian Floor Hockey Team, which competed in the AAU Junior Olympic Games (Amateur Athletic Union) in the United States. The Canadian team finished in third place. Jacks also coached a AAU Junior Olympic Games track and field team in 1947 and won the trophy for third place.
In 1948, Jacks, a resident of West Ferris, Ontario, became the first Director of Parks and Recreation for the city of North Bay, Ontario, in Northern Ontario. After moving to the city and accepting the position he then became a member of the Northern Ontario Recreation Directors Association (NORDA). Soon after he played an important role in developing the first Northern Ontario Playground Hockey Association (NOPHA), an organization whose goal was to help inspire youth to play ice hockey on outdoor rinks. In 1963 he created the Society of Directors of Municipal Recreation of Ontario (SDMRO). He served as its first President and remained in the position for two consecutive terms (1963–1964).

By 1963, Jacks was serving as the municipal recreation director of North Bay, had become a member of the Northern Ontario Recreation Directors Association (NORDA) and was the president of the Society of Directors of Municipal Recreation of Ontario (SDMRO). That same year, Jacks created a winter team sport for girls, called ringette, which involved ice skating.() Critical to the development of the new sport, Red McCarthy, the director of recreation in Espanola, Ontario, who was a member of NORDA and developed the sport&#x27;s first set of rules after volunteering to help experiment with Jacks&#x27;s basic rules. Most of the initial rules set out by McCarthy are still part of ringette. Today ringette is one among only four ice skating team sports in existence worldwide, with bandy, ice hockey, and rinkball being the other three. However, ringette is the only one of the four winter sports in which the best athletes are female, rather than male.

In Ontario, Jacks was awarded &quot;The Citation for Outstanding Contribution and Dedication to Recreation,&quot; one of the highest honours of the Society of Directors of Municipal Recreation of Ontario. The honour was presented to him personally by John Robarts, the 17th Premier of Ontario.

==Ringette==
While living in West Ferris in 1963 Jacks became responsible for his most well known achievement, his invention of the sport of ringette. Jacks had reportedly worked for two years to develop a presentation for the sport. His wife, Agnes Jacks. stated, &quot;I must make one point clear, this was not part of his job, this was his own interest on his own time.&quot;

Jacks was the founder of the Society of Directors of Municipal Recreation of Ontario (SDMRO) and was serving as its first President in 1963 when he presented his proposal for a new winter team sport for girls to the Northern Ontario Recreation Directors Association (NORDA). Mirl Arthur &quot;Red&quot; McCarthy, the director of recreation in Espanola, Ontario. and a member of NORDA then volunteered to further develop them.

The sport of ringette was created to both address and remedy two ongoing problems. The first was the observation and criticism regarding the tendency by those organizing, developing, and administering recreation programs to place most of their time, resources, and focus on running sports programs aimed at the male population to the exclusion of the female population, a problem that had concerned Jacks for some time. The second was to address additional criticism that almost immediately affected the newly-created SDMRO, which pointed out the tendency for sports programs to be largely male-oriented. Meanwhile, it was pointed out by the SDMRO that while programming for girls had been implemented and opportunities for girls existed, there had been a continual lack of success in Ontario in regards to gaining and maintaining participation by girls in winter sports. In Ontario and the rest of North America, only two winter-based team sports programs were available to girls at the time: girls&#x27; broomball and girls&#x27; ice hockey. However, only ice hockey involved ice skating. Both organized sports programs for girls already existed and were being administered in Ontario, but neither sport had proved successful, and both failed to generate and maintain interest among the female population.

Jacks&#x27;s idea to remedy the situation was to try to create or discover a new winter team sport just for the girls themselves. The new team sport had to help attract girls who had little to do in winter months, be accessible to as many girls as possible (including girls whose families could not afford figure skating), and attractive to girls who simply were not otherwise inclined. Jacks then introduced his idea for ringette to NORDA and the SDMRO. Initially, the team sport was conceptualized as a type of sport that could be played on either a court or in a gymnasium, but Jacks soon decided to make it a team sport that involved ice skating since girls had never had their own sport of that type.

Sam and Agnes Jacks had no daughters, and their three sons were talented ice hockey players, with two of them eventually winning scholarships at renowned schools, but Sam and Agnes still recognized the needs and concerns of girls, and Sam was never deterred from creating a sport just for the girls themselves:

The Northern Ontario town of Espanola is considered &quot;The Home of Ringette&quot; since its first official rules were drafted there by Red McCarthy, but the Northern Ontario city of North Bay is considered the &quot;Birthplace of Ringette&quot; since Jacks was working there when he first developed the sport as a concept. Both Sam Jacks and Red McCarthy are credited as the sport&#x27;s founders. Despite the historical differences, today the title of &quot;birthplace of ringette&quot; is often shared by both cities.

To date, with the exception of the artistic sport of synchronized skating, ringette remains the only winter team sport to have been exclusively developed for and around the female physique and to be driven by a female athlete demographic.

== Death ==
Jacks died from cancer on May 14, 1975, at the age of 60. His wife, Agnes (MacKrell) Jacks, died of heart failure on April 1, 2005, at the North Bay General Hospital. She was 81.

<doc id="628206" wikidata="Q312248" url="?curid=628206" title="Vesto Slipher">
<text>Vesto Melvin Slipher (; November 11, 1875 – November 8, 1969) was an American astronomer who performed the first measurements of radial velocities for galaxies. He was the first to discover that distant galaxies are redshifted, thus providing the first empirical basis for the expansion of the universe. He was also the first to relate these redshifts to velocity.

==Early life and education==
Vesto Melvin Slipher was born in Mulberry, Indiana, to Daniel Clark and Hannah App Slipher. He spent his early years working on his family farm in Mulberry. Vesto had a younger brother, Earl C. Slipher, who was also an astronomer at Lowell Observatory.
Slipher went to high school in Frankfort, IN. He then attended Indiana University in Bloomington, IN and earned his Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Mechanics and Astronomy in June 1901. Two years later, Slipher earned his Master&#x27;s Degree in the same program. At the age of 33, Vesto graduated with his Ph.D. in Mechanics and Astronomy from Indiana University.

==Career==
While at school at Indiana University, Slipher formed a personal bond with one of his professors, William Cogshall. Cogshall was one of the main reasons Slipher became interested in astronomy in the first place. Cogshall convinced Percival Lowell, director of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, to take Vesto in as a temporary assistant. Slipher worked as an assistant from 1901 to 1915 when Lowell finally named him the assistant director of the observatory. One year later Percival Lowell died and Vesto became the acting director for the next ten years. In 1926, 25 years after arriving in Flagstaff, Slipher was named director of the Lowell Observatory. He remained in charge for 28 more years when he retired from professional life. Slipher spent his years there studying many things, but most notably, spectroscopy and redshifts of spiral nebulae.

The first major task Slipher was given was to measure our solar system&#x27;s planets&#x27; rotation interval. He was one of the first astronomers to show that Uranus has a much faster rotation than Earth, similar to the other giant planets in our solar system. What Vesto is most known for though is his work with spiral nebulae, or, spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way and Andromeda. His initial goal was to measure how fast the nebulae were moving. His discoveries were confirmed ten years later when Edwin Hubble used the Mount Wilson Observatory reflector to view the galaxies much more clearly.

Slipher introduced as early as 1909 that the infrared spectrum could be recorded using photographic emulsions, and used those to record the absorption lines of sunlight and major planets. He found that the planets showed different absorption lines that were not present in sunlight, and identified those bands with ammonia and methane. In the early twentieth century, Vesto Slipher elongated the spectrum to include the red and infrared wavelengths and showed that the major planets display strong absorption lines at many different wavelengths. Slipher used spectroscopy to investigate the rotation periods of planets and the composition of planetary atmospheres. In 1912, he was the first to observe the shift of spectral lines of galaxies, making him the discoverer of galactic redshifts. Using the Doppler effect and noting subtle changes, he measured the speeds in which spiral nebulae traveled during his research from 1912 and onward. 
These subtle changes in the speeds of the nebulae led Slipher to conclude that the nebulae were not within the Milky Way galaxy. In 1914, Slipher also made the first discovery of the rotation of spiral galaxies.
He discovered the sodium layer in 1929. He was responsible for hiring Clyde Tombaugh and supervised the work that led to the discovery of Pluto in 1930.

By 1917, Slipher had measured the radial velocities of 25 &quot;spiral nebulae,&quot; and found that all but three of those galaxies were moving away from us, at substantial speeds. Slipher himself speculated that this might be due to the motion of our own galaxy – as in his sample, those galaxies moving towards us and those moving away from us were roughly in opposite directions. In hindsight, this was the first data supporting models of an expanding universe. Later, Slipher&#x27;s and additional spectroscopic measurements of radial velocities were combined by Edwin Hubble with Hubble&#x27;s own determinations of galaxy distances, leading Hubble to discover the (at that time, rough) proportionality between galaxies&#x27; distances and redshifts, which is today termed the Hubble–Lemaître law (formerly named Hubble&#x27;s law; the IAU Decision of October 2018 recommends the use of a new name), was formulated by Hubble and Humason in 1929 and became the basis for the modern model of the expanding universe.

==Personal life==
Slipher married Emma R. Munger in 1904 in Frankfort, IN. Vesto and Emma had two children together, David Clark and Marcia Frances.

In 1901, Vesto Slipher moved to Flagstaff, Arizona and began work at Lowell Observatory. He spent the next 53 years of his life working at Lowell Observatory as an assistant and then the director of the observatory until his retirement in 1954. Slipher lived until age 93 and died in Flagstaff in 1969. He is buried at Citizens Cemetery in Flagstaff.

<doc id="628208" wikidata="Q2226897" url="?curid=628208" title="Memphis Pyramid">
<text>The Memphis Pyramid, formerly known as the Great American Pyramid and the Pyramid Arena, and colloquially known as the Bass Pro Shops Pyramid, is a pyramid-shaped building located in downtown Memphis, Tennessee, United States, at the bank of the Mississippi River. Built in 1991 as a 20,142-seat arena, the facility was owned and operated jointly by the city of Memphis and Shelby County until Shelby County sold its share to Memphis in April 2009. Its structure plays on the city&#x27;s namesake in Egypt, which is known for its ancient pyramids. It is (about 32 stories) tall and has base sides of ; it is by some measures the tenth-tallest pyramid in the world.

The Memphis Pyramid has not been regularly used as a sports or entertainment venue since 2007. In 2015, the Pyramid re-opened as a Bass Pro Shops megastore, which included shopping, a hotel, restaurants, a bowling alley, and an archery range, with an outdoor observation deck adjacent to its apex. Ducks Unlimited also operates a museum on waterfowl hunting and wetlands conservation inside of the store.

==Construction==
The Great American Pyramid was first conceived around 1954 by Mark C. Hartz, a Memphis artist. The project originally included three pyramids located on the south bluffs of Memphis overlooking the Mississippi River. The largest of the three would have been scaled at two-thirds the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza near Memphis, Egypt; the flanking structures would have been scaled at two-thirds the size of the main pyramid. The project languished for three decades until Mark&#x27;s younger son, Memphian Jon Brent Hartz, resurrected the concept. Mark C. Hartz, who was well known for his architectural renderings, rendered a new bronze glass-glazed pyramid. After years of negotiations, the younger Hartz&#x27;s concept was adopted by entrepreneur John Tigrett as a symbol for the city of Memphis. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 15, 1989, and the building was opened on November 9, 1991.

The construction of the building was managed by Sidney Shlenker, part-owner of the Denver Nuggets and several entertainment companies, whom Tigrett had brought to Memphis to develop tourist attractions in the building. Originally, there were plans for a shortwave radio station broadcasting Memphis music, an observation deck with an inclinator along the side of the building, a Hard Rock Cafe, a music museum, a College Football Hall of Fame, and a theme park on Mud Island. However, the plans were scrapped because of a fallout between Tigrett and Shlenker, and the latter&#x27;s financial difficulties.

==Various former uses and events==

The Pyramid was the home court of the University of Memphis men&#x27;s basketball program starting in 1991, and later for the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Memphis Grizzlies after they relocated from Vancouver in 2001. However, both teams left The Pyramid in November 2004 to move into the newly built FedExForum. It was also home of the Memphis Pharaohs of the Arena Football League for the 1995 and 1996 AFL season before they relocated to Portland in 1997.

The arena hosted the 1993 Great Midwest Conference Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s basketball tournaments, the 1994 and 1997 Southeastern Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament, the 1996 and 2000 Conference USA men&#x27;s basketball tournament, and the 2003 Conference USA women&#x27;s basketball tournament. It also held the first and second rounds of the NCAA Tournament in 1995, 1997, and 2001. The Grateful Dead played two concerts at the arena on April 1 and 2, 1995.

Singer Mary J. Blige performed at the arena in September 1997 during her Share My World Tour.

The Pyramid was the site in 1999 of the WWF St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre: In Your House pay-per-view which featured Big Show&#x27;s WWE debut (under his real name Paul Wight); also in 1999 the rock bands the Rolling Stones and Phish played sold-out concerts. Phish released an audio recording of the concert, entitled &quot;Memphis &#x27;99&quot;, as a digital download in 2022.

On June 8, 2002, the Pyramid hosted Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson, one of the biggest professional boxing events in history, which Lewis won by knockout in the eighth round. The following year it hosted Mike Tyson vs. Clifford Etienne, a fight that Tyson won by knockout in the first round.

On August 16, 2002, the arena hosted a concert that commemorated the 25th anniversary of Elvis Presley&#x27;s death.

From 2002 to 2006, the annual Church of God in Christ international holy convocations were held here.

Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band performed what is reputed to be the last concert ever in the Pyramid, in February 2007.

Filmmaker Craig Brewer used the building as a sound stage for his film &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot; in late 2005.

==Troubles and closure==
In 2001, the city of Memphis attempted to relocate the Vancouver Grizzlies or the Charlotte Hornets to Memphis. While the Pyramid was functional and profitable, it would have required retrofitting in order to be a viable long-term venue for an NBA franchise. A retrofit would also have required taking the arena offline for a year. As a result, the $250 million FedExForum was built as a condition of the Grizzlies&#x27; move from Vancouver and opened in 2004. The city of Memphis did spend $7 million on renovations such as improved dressing rooms and new television camera platforms for the Grizzlies&#x27; three-year stay in the arena.

While hosting the Grizzlies, the arena lost $200,000 in 2002.

The City of Memphis&#x27;s contract with the Grizzlies forbade the use of The Pyramid without the team&#x27;s approval, and, as a result, it went dark. The Memphis city council voted to keep the arena open in 2004. A committee headed by Memphis businessman Scott Ledbetter studied possible uses of the arena in 2005 and considered such uses as converting the arena into a casino, an aquarium, a shopping mall, or an indoor theme park. In November 2006, Congressman-Elect Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee) suggested that he would attempt to open a Mid-American branch of the Smithsonian Institution in the building. However, these plans were never realized. In the end, the Ledbetter committee on the building&#x27;s future recommended that it be used for destination retail, which would create more jobs and new tax revenues.

==Bass Pro Shops and redevelopment==
In October 2005, media speculation began to focus on an aquarium or a Bass Pro Shops superstore as the most likely long-term tenants of the arena. In 2008, the city and Bass Pro Shops reached a tentative agreement, short on details, but based on an intent to develop the then-abandoned structure. On June 30, 2010, after 5 years of negotiating, Bass Pro Shops and the City of Memphis signed an agreement for a 55-year lease for a Bass Pro Shops megastore. In addition, the redevelopment plans included revitalizing the Pinch District, which is the neighborhood east of the Pyramid. The city invested $30 million and hired O.T. Marshall Architects to help with the seismic retrofitting of the structure, which was funded by sales tax revenue in the surrounding area. O.T. Marshall and Insight Design Architects was later hired by Bass Pro Shops for its renovations and construction, which led to its opening April 29, 2015. Construction was completed by W.G. Yates &amp; Sons Construction Company.

In addition to the retail store itself, Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid is home to an archery range, a shooting range, and a laser arcade. The building also includes a Wahlburghers Wild and an Uncle Buck&#x27;s Fishbowl and Grill with a bowling alley and a saltwater aquarium. The tallest freestanding elevator in America takes visitors to the Lookout at the Pyramid at the apex of the building, where people can take in the view on an indoor and outdoor observation deck or dine and drink at the Lookout, which is a restaurant, bar, and aquarium at the top of the building. At the base of the Pyramid is a 100-room hotel, the Big Cypress Lodge. Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid contains 600,000 gallons of water features and the largest collection of waterfowl and hunting-related equipment in the world.

Over 3 million people visited Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid in 2015. In 2015, Bass Pro Shops considered adding a zip-line and a second hotel to the Pyramid.

In 2011, a drawing of the pyramid was incorporated into the standard design of Tennessee&#x27;s state-issued driver&#x27;s licenses alongside Nashville&#x27;s AT&amp;T Building, Knoxville&#x27;s Sunsphere, and Chattanooga&#x27;s Tennessee Aquarium.

<text>Ira Sprague Bowen (December 21, 1898 – February 6, 1973) was an American physicist and astronomer. In 1927 he discovered that nebulium was not really a chemical element but instead doubly ionized oxygen.

==Life and work==

Bowen was born in Seneca Falls, New York in 1898 to Philinda Sprague and James Bowen. Due to frequent moves of his family he was home schooled until his father died in 1908. From that point on he attended Houghton College where his mother worked as teacher. After graduation from high school in 1915 Bowen stayed at the junior college of Houghton College, and later joined Oberlin College from which he graduated in 1919. During his time at Oberlin, Bowen did some research on the properties of steel for the scientist Robert Hadfield. Their results were published in 1921.

Bowen began studying physics at the University of Chicago in fall 1919. By 1921 he took a position in the research group of Robert Andrews Millikan. He was assigned to do ultraviolet spectroscopy of chemical elements. Millikan was persuaded by George Ellery Hale to move to the California Institute of Technology in 1921 and Bowen moved with him. The contact with Hale enabled Bowen also to work at the Mount Wilson Observatory and the Palomar Observatory. Bowen gave lectures on general physics at Caltech and did research on cosmic rays and followed his studies on UV spectroscopy. He also did calculations on spectra for the light elements of the periodic table. With that data and the inspiration from a chapter on gaseous nebula and the emission of radiation at low density in the book &quot;Astronomy&quot; by Henry Norris Russell, Raymond Smith Dugan and John Quincy Stewart he achieved his best known discovery.

The green emission lines of the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula at 4959 and 5007 Ångström were discovered by William Huggins in 1864. Because no known element was showing these emission lines in the experiment it was concluded in the late 1890s that a new element was responsible for that lines, it was called nebulium. Bowen was able to calculate the forbidden transitions of doubly ionized oxygen to be exactly where the lines had been found. The low probability for collisions in the nebula made it impossible for the oxygen to get from the excited stated to the ground state and so the forbidden transitions were the main path for the relaxation. Bowen published his findings in 1927 and concluded that nebulium was not really a chemical element.

Bowen was the first director of the Palomar Observatory, serving from 1948 to 1964.

Before his retirement in 1964 and even afterwards Bowen was involved in the improvement of the optical design of several large optical instruments, for example the 100 inch Irenee duPont at the Las Campanas Observatory.

He is also known in the context of meteorology for the introduction of the Bowen ratio, which quantifies the ratio of sensible to latent heat over an evaporating surface.

==Honors==
Ira Sprague Bowen was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1936, the American Philosophical Society in 1940, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950.

<doc id="628229" wikidata="Q3177837" url="?curid=628229" title="X86 instruction listings">
<text>The x86 instruction set refers to the set of instructions that x86-compatible microprocessors support. The instructions are usually part of an executable program, often stored as a computer file and executed on the processor.

The x86 instruction set has been extended several times, introducing wider registers and datatypes as well as new functionality.

== x86 integer instructions ==

Below is the full 8086/8088 instruction set of Intel (81 instructions total). These instructions are also available in 32-bit mode, in which they operate on 32-bit registers (eax, ebx, etc.) and values instead of their 16-bit (ax, bx, etc.) counterparts. The updated instruction set is grouped according to architecture (i186, i286, i386, i486, i586/i686) and is referred to as (32-bit) x86 and (64-bit) x86-64 (also known as AMD64).

=== Original 8086/8088 instructions ===

This is the original instruction set. In the &#x27;Notes&#x27; column, &quot;r&quot; means &quot;register&quot;, &quot;m&quot; means &quot;memory address&quot; and &quot;imm&quot; means &quot;immediate&quot; (i.e. a value).

=== Added in specific processors ===

==== Added with 80186/80188 ====

==== Added with 80286 ====
The new instructions added in 80286 add support for x86 protected mode. Some but not all of the instructions are available in real mode as well.


==== Added with 80386 ====
The 80386 added support for 32-bit operation to the x86 instruction set. This was done by widening the general-purpose registers to 32 bits and introducing the concepts of &quot;OperandSize&quot; and &quot;AddressSize&quot; – most instruction forms that would previously take 16-bit data arguments were given the ability to take 32-bit arguments by setting their OperandSize to 32 bits, and instructions that could take 16-bit address arguments were given the ability to take 32-bit address arguments by setting their AddressSize to 32 bits. (Instruction forms that work on 8-bit data continue to be 8-bit regardless of OperandSize. Using a data size of 16 bits will cause only the bottom 16 bits of the 32-bit general-purpose registers to be modified – the top 16 bits are left unchanged.)

The default OperandSize and AddressSize to use for each instruction is given by the D bit of the segment descriptor of the current code segment - codice_1 makes both 16-bit, codice_2 makes both 32-bit. Additionally, they can be overridden on a per-instruction basis with two new instruction prefixes that were introduced in the 80386:
* codice_3: OperandSize override. Will change OperandSize from 16-bit to 32-bit if codice_4, or from 32-bit to 16-bit if codice_5.
* codice_6: AddressSize override. Will change AddressSize from 16-bit to 32-bit if codice_4, or from 32-bit to 16-bit if codice_5.

The 80386 also introduced the two new segment registers codice_9 and codice_10 as well as the x86 control, debug and test registers.

The new instructions introduced in the 80386 can broadly be subdivided into two classes:
* Pre-existing opcodes that needed new mnemonics for their 32-bit OperandSize variants (e.g. codice_11, codice_12)
* New opcodes that introduced new functionality (e.g. codice_13, codice_14)
For instruction forms where the operand size can be inferred from the instruction&#x27;s arguments (e.g. codice_15 can be inferred to have a 32-bit OperandSize due to its use of EAX as an argument), new instruction mnemonics are not needed and not provided.



==== Added with 80486 ====


==== Added in P5/P6-class processors ====
Integer/system instructions that were not present in the basic 80486 instruction set, but were added in various x86 processors prior to the introduction of SSE. (Discontinued instructions are not included.)

=== Added as instruction set extensions ===

==== Added with x86-64 ====

These instructions can only be encoded in 64 bit mode. They fall in four groups:

* original instructions that reuse existing opcodes for a different purpose (codice_16 replacing codice_17)
* original instructions with new opcodes (codice_18)
* existing instructions extended to a 64 bit address size (codice_19)
* existing instructions extended to a 64 bit operand size (remaining instructions)

Most instructions with a 64 bit operand size encode this using a codice_20 prefix; in the absence of the codice_20 prefix,
the corresponding instruction with 32 bit operand size is encoded. This mechanism also applies to most other instructions with 32 bit operand
size. These are not listed here as they do not gain a new mnemonic in Intel syntax when used with a 64 bit operand size.


==== Bit manipulation extensions ====
Bit manipulation instructions. For all of the VEX-encoded instructions defined by BMI1 and BMI2, the operand size may be 32 or 64 bits, controlled by the VEX.W bit – none of these instructions are available in 16-bit variants. The VEX-encoded instructions are not available in Real Mode and Virtual-8086 mode - other than that, the bit manipulation instructions are available in all operating modes on supported CPUs.

==== Added with Intel TSX ====

==== Added with Intel CET ====
Intel CET (Control-Flow Enforcement Technology) adds two distinct features to help protect against security exploits such as return-oriented programming: a shadow stack (CET_SS), and indirect branch tracking (CET_IBT).

==== Added with XSAVE ====
The XSAVE instruction set extensions are designed to save/restore CPU extended state (typically for the purpose of context switching) in a manner that can be extended to cover new instruction set extensions without the OS context-switching code needing to understand the specifics of the new extensions. This is done by defining a series of &quot;state-components&quot;, each with a size and offset within a given save area, and each corresponding to a subset of the state needed for one CPU extension or another. The codice_22 CPUID leaf is used to provide information about which state-components the CPU supports and what their sizes/offsets are, so that the OS can reserve the proper amount of space and set the associated enable-bits.

==== Added with other cross-vendor extensions ====


==== Added with other Intel-specific extensions ====

==== Added with other AMD-specific extensions ====

== x87 floating-point instructions ==
The x87 coprocessor, if present, provides support for floating-point arithmetic. The coprocessor provides eight data registers, each holding one 80-bit floating-point value (1 sign bit, 15 exponent bits, 64 mantissa bits) – these registers are organized as a stack, with the top-of-stack register referred to as &quot;st&quot; or &quot;st(0)&quot;, and the other registers referred to as st(1), st(2), ...st(7). It additionally provides a number of control and status registers, including &quot;PC&quot; (precision control, to control whether floating-point operations should be rounded to 24, 53 or 64 mantissa bits) and &quot;RC&quot; (rounding control, to pick rounding-mode: round-to-zero, round-to-positive-infinity, round-to-negative-infinity, round-to-nearest-even) and a 4-bit condition code register &quot;CC&quot;, whose four bits are individually referred to as C0, C1, C2 and C3). Not all of the arithmetic instructions provided by x87 obey PC and RC.

=== Original 8087 instructions ===

=== x87 instructions added in later processors ===


== SIMD instructions ==

== Cryptographic instructions ==

== Virtualization instructions ==

== Other instructions ==
x86 also includes discontinued instruction sets which are no longer supported by Intel and AMD, and undocumented instructions which execute but are not officially documented.

===Undocumented x86 instructions===

The x86 CPUs contain undocumented instructions which are implemented on the chips but not listed in some official documents. They can be found in various sources across the Internet, such as Ralf Brown&#x27;s Interrupt List and at sandpile.org

Some of these instructions are widely available across many/most x86 CPUs, while others are specific to a narrow range of CPUs.

<text>Saul Zaentz (; February 28, 1921January 3, 2014) was an American film producer and record company executive. He won the Academy Award for Best Picture three times and, in 1996, was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.

Zaentz&#x27;s film production career, primarily financed by the profits from Creedence Clearwater Revival, was marked by a dedication to the adaptation of novels. A prolific reader, Zaentz typically did not produce original screenplays. His final production, &quot;Goya&#x27;s Ghosts&quot;, was an exception, being an original story by Jean-Claude Carrière and Miloš Forman.

==Early life==
Zaentz was born on February 28, 1921, in Passaic, New Jersey, the youngest of five. His parents were Polish Jewish immigrants.

As a child, Zaentz attended William B. Cruz Memorial school number 11 in Passaic. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, Zaentz began realizing his passion for music by working for Jazz at the Philharmonic and record company head Norman Granz, a job that included managing concert tours for musicians such as Duke Ellington and Stan Getz. He studied at Rutgers after the war on the GI Bill.

==Music career==

===Creedence Clearwater Revival===
In 1955 he joined Fantasy Records, for many years the largest independent jazz record label in the world. In 1967 Zaentz and other partners purchased the label from founders Max and Sol Weiss. The partners signed roots-rock group Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), fronted by former Fantasy warehouseman John Fogerty.

Fantasy Records owned the distribution and publishing rights to CCR&#x27;s music, so to extricate himself from his original contract with Fantasy, Fogerty signed away even more than the original contract had stipulated. Additionally, bad investments by Zaentz and Fantasy, seemingly on the group&#x27;s behalf, cost CCR millions of dollars, some of which the group recouped through legal proceedings.

Songs about the experience on Fogerty&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Centerfield&quot; – &quot;Zanz Kant Danz&quot; and &quot;Mr. Greed&quot; – were thinly veiled slams at Zaentz. Defamation of character lawsuits followed for the lyric, &quot;Zanz can&#x27;t dance but he&#x27;ll steal your money&quot;. The defamation issue was settled with Warner Bros. and Fogerty changing the title and lyric to &quot;Vanz Kant Danz&quot;. Fogerty countersued for reimbursement of attorneys&#x27; fees and in a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, &quot;Fogerty v. Fantasy&quot;, 510 U.S. 517 (1994), he won.

Zaentz also unsuccessfully sued Fogerty for plagiarism, claiming that the melodic line in &quot;The Old Man Down the Road&quot; (on &quot;Centerfield&quot;) was a lift from the Fantasy-copyrighted-but-Fogerty-written song &quot;Run Through the Jungle&quot; from CCR&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot;. Zaentz sought $140 million in damages but lost, in &quot;Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty&quot;, when a jury found Fogerty not liable.

Fogerty continued to maintain that the label misled him about investing and managing his earnings from royalties, resulting in devastating financial loss. Years later, after Zaentz sold his interest in Fantasy, Fogerty almost immediately re-signed with the label.

==Film career==
Zaentz received the Best Picture Oscar for three films, two of them directed by Miloš Forman —&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975) and &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984)— as well as for &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996), directed by Anthony Minghella.

In the early 1970s he saw the stage adaptation of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; at a theatre in the Jackson Square area of San Francisco. Zaentz co-produced the film adaptation with actor Michael Douglas. The film won five Academy Awards including Best Picture, which Zaentz and Douglas shared. This award sweep had not been experienced in 41 years. In 1980, Zaentz created The Saul Zaentz Film Center in Berkeley, California, an editing and sound-mixing studio for his own films, independent filmmakers, and Hollywood productions.

In 1984 Zaentz and Forman collaborated again, on the adaptation of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s stage play &quot;Amadeus&quot; about composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It won eight Academy Awards, including Zaentz&#x27;s second Best Picture, and spun off a best-selling soundtrack album (distributed by Fantasy Records).

Zaentz next produced &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;, directed by Peter Weir on location in Belize and starring Harrison Ford, adapted from the book by Paul Theroux. In 1988, Zaentz produced &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, based on the Milan Kundera novel. The adaptation was directed by Philip Kaufman from a screenplay by Jean-Claude Carrière.

Zaentz&#x27;s following film, &quot;At Play in the Fields of the Lord&quot;, adapted by Jean-Claude Carrière from the book by Peter Matthiessen, shot by Hector Babenco on location in the Amazon Rainforest, continued &quot;Mosquito Coast&quot;″s theme of the clash of Western values with the primitive.

In 1992, Zaentz purchased the rights to the unpublished novel &quot;The English Patient&quot; and worked up a scenario with author Michael Ondaatje. In developing the project Zaentz resisted attempts by his backers to make the story more acceptable to a mainstream audience whereby they wanted him to cast Demi Moore in a leading role. Zaentz instead chose Kristin Scott Thomas for the role. The book was adapted for the screen and directed by Anthony Minghella. &quot;English Patient&quot; swept the 69th Academy Awards, winning Best Director for Minghella and Best Picture for Zaentz. At the same ceremony, Zaentz also accepted The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for lifetime achievement.

In 2003, Zaentz was made a Fellow of BAFTA, in recognition of his film career. In 2004–05. Zaentz and partners sold Fantasy Records to independent jazz label Concord Records, and closed the Saul Zaentz Film Center. In 2005–06 Zaentz embarked on a new film project, &quot;Goya&#x27;s Ghosts&quot;, centered on events in the life of Spanish painter Francisco Goya, starring Natalie Portman, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgård as Goya, and featuring Randy Quaid as the king of Spain. The film was made with long-time collaborators Miloš Forman (director) and Jean-Claude Carrière (screenplay). Shot on location in Spain and edited in New York, the film was released in late 2006.

==&quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;==
Through Tolkien Enterprises, now named Middle-earth Enterprises, Saul Zaentz owned the worldwide film, stage, and merchandise rights to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It also includes &quot;matching rights&quot; should Tolkien&#x27;s estate film &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; or &quot;The Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-Earth.&quot; What it did not include was the rights for televisions shows (for any show longer than eight episodes).

In 1976, Zaentz acquired certain rights as regards &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; from United Artists, who had in turn purchased them directly from Tolkien eight years prior. In 1978, Zaentz produced an animated version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, written chiefly by Peter S. Beagle and directed by animator Ralph Bakshi.

Tolkien Enterprises granted an exclusive tabletop game license to company Iron Crown Enterprises in 1982, which was the largest such license in the industry up to that time.

Eight years after his death, Zaentz Co. decided to sell &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; rights.

On August 18, 2022, Embracer Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase Middle-earth Enterprises from The Saul Zaentz Company. 

=== &quot;The Hobbit&quot; director controversy ===
Zaentz was peripherally involved in the controversy about who would make a live-action film version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, because of his ownership of the film rights to the novel.

Peter Jackson, who directed the successful &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, was the first person scheduled to direct &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. However, Jackson&#x27;s production company Wingnut Films questioned New Line Cinema&#x27;s accounting methods, bringing in an outside auditor as allowed by the contract, and eventually sued New Line. New Line executive Robert Shaye took great offense, declared that they would never work with Jackson again, and began looking for another director. Jackson said that he could not work on the film until the lawsuit was settled, and that he was apparently off the project indefinitely. MGM, which owned the distribution rights, was more hopeful that a deal could be worked out.

Shaye explained his company&#x27;s position, saying that New Line&#x27;s contract with Zaentz was going to expire soon, which forced them to find a new director. If the litigation were resolved by a court or by a settlement the original plan could proceed, but then New Line might need to reorganize to allow someone other than Shaye to deal with Jackson. The situation was made more complex by Zaentz&#x27;s ongoing dispute with New Line over profits from the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films. The dispute began shortly after the release of the films. In December 2007 &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Zaentz was also suing New Line, alleging that the studio has refused to make records available so that he can confirm his profit-participation statements are accurate.

In 2010, it became clear that Peter Jackson would direct &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films after all.

=== Trademark enforcement ===
In 2011, Zaentz&#x27;s company began several legal actions against small businesses in the UK to enforce their &quot;Hobbit&quot; trademark, including the Hungry Hobbit cafe in Sarehole, Birmingham and a pub in Southampton, England, which had traded as The Hobbit for twenty years. This raised the ire of many British correspondents such as Stephen Fry, who described it as &quot;pointless, self-defeating bullying.&quot;

==The Saul Zaentz Film Center==
The Saul Zaentz Film Center (becoming the Zaentz Media Center after renovations) was a facility in Berkeley, California, that for many years provided production and post-production services for Bay Area filmmakers. Along with American Zoetrope and Lucasfilm, it was one of only three major film production facilities in Northern California. By 2005, it had largely shut down its post-production facilities, except for the foley recording studio, which is part of Fantasy Studios, which closed in 2018.

The film center was sold in 2007. It housed Concord Music Group and Fantasy Studios as well the Berkeley Digital Film Institute and other media production companies.

==Archive==
Zaentz&#x27;s moving image collection is housed at the Academy Film Archive.

==Death==
Zaentz died on January 3, 2014, in San Francisco, California, at age 92 of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease complications.

John Fogerty noted his death on his Facebook page by posting the music video for his song &quot;Vanz Kant Danz&quot;. Michael Douglas paid tribute to Zaentz in an article in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, saying:

==Philanthropy==
The Saul Zaentz Charitable Foundation launched in 1997. On May 17, 2016, the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) announced a $35.5 million gift from the foundation, calling it &quot;the largest gift ever given to a university to focus on advancing early childhood education, and the largest gift in HGSE&#x27;s history&quot;.

==Personal life==
Zaentz was married twice, first to Celia Mingus, the ex-wife of Charles Mingus. His second wife was Lynda Redfield, widow of actor William Redfield. Both of Zaentz’s marriages ended in divorce.

<text>Park Ji-sung (; ; born 30 March 1981) is a South Korean former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Born in the South Korean capital Seoul, Park is one of the greatest and most successful Asian players in football history, having won 19 trophies in his career. He is the first Asian footballer to win the UEFA Champions League, play in a UEFA Champions League final, and win the FIFA Club World Cup. Park was able to play anywhere across the midfield and was noted for his exceptional fitness level, discipline, work ethic and off-the-ball movement. His remarkable endurance levels earned him the nickname &quot;Three-Lung&quot; Park.

Park began his football career in his native South Korea and played for the Myongji University team before moving to Japan to play for Kyoto Purple Sanga. After Park&#x27;s national team manager Guus Hiddink moved back to the Netherlands to manage PSV Eindhoven, Park followed him to the Dutch side a year later. He won two Eredivisie titles, a KNVB Cup and a Johan Cruyff Shield in Eindhoven before his talents were recognised by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson as PSV reached the semi-finals of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League. Park signed for Manchester United for a fee of around £4 million in July 2005, and in his time at United won 11 trophies, including four Premier League titles, the UEFA Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup. He moved to Queens Park Rangers in 2012 after seven years with Manchester United. However, an injury-interrupted season with QPR, combined with the club&#x27;s relegation, led to Park rejoining PSV on loan for the 2013–14 season, following which he retired due to a knee injury.

As a member of the South Korea national team, Park won 100 caps and scored 13 goals. He was a member of the team that finished fourth at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and also represented his nation at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. At the World Cup, he was named man of the match four times, the most of any Asian player, and is currently South Korea&#x27;s joint all-time leading World Cup goalscorer with three goals alongside Ahn Jung-hwan and Son Heung-min, having scored in three consecutive tournaments.

==Early life==
Park was born in Seoul, but his family registered his birth in Goheung, Jeonnam, which is his father&#x27;s hometown. He then left for Suwon, a satellite city of Seoul, and spent his adolescence there. He began playing football during his fourth year of elementary school. He attended Anyong Middle School and Suwon Technical High School. While at school, Park attracted attention as one of the most promising young talents in South Korea and was scouted by a number of clubs. He was well known for his excellent work rate, mesmerising dribbling and accurate passes. However, his small physique became a weak point after he entered middle school. His father, Park Sung-jong, quit his job and started a butcher shop for his son&#x27;s dream. Sung-jong not only fed Park different meats but also frogs, antlers and deer blood, in the belief that it would increase his physical abilities. While in high school, Park helped his high school team&#x27;s win at high school competition of the Korean National Sports Festival in 1998, though he was at that point rejected by a number of professional clubs and universities due to his small stature. He ended up playing for Myongji University after Lee Hak-jong, his high school coach, strongly recommended him to Kim Hee-tae, the university coach. Park was attached to the university&#x27;s tennis club at that time, because the football club was full, so Kim asked the tennis coach for help.

From the winter holiday of his secondary school year, Park began to train with his university team as a prospective member. A few weeks later, in January 1999, his university team was given the chance to train with the South Korea Olympic team. After a splendid performance, he attracted the attention of Huh Jung-moo, the coach of the South Korea national team and Olympic team. Thereafter he became a preliminary member of the Olympic team, and finally a formal member of its squad. At 18 years old, it was believed that if Park had not been selected for the Olympic team, he would have been selected for the under-20 team instead. This selection was so unexpected for Park and others that it was rumoured that Huh selected Park to fulfil a bet after losing to Kim Hee-tae in a game of Go.

On 5 April 2000, in a 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification match against Laos, Park made his debut as a member of the national team, along with Lee Chun-soo. In June 2000, while he was a national team member and a second year student at Myongji University, Kyoto Purple Sanga of Japan offered Park a contract and he took the offer though he was still a relative unknown. Park was the first instance of a relatively unknown Korean player being offered a contract by a Japanese club.

In September 2000, at the 2000 Summer Olympics, his Olympic team failed to advance to the knockout stage, and the South Korea national football team replaced head coach Huh Jung-moo with Guus Hiddink.

==Club career==
===Kyoto Purple Sanga===
In June 2000, Park signed with the Kyoto-based then J1 League side Kyoto Purple Sanga. In the spring of 2000, hearing that there was a rising star in Korea, Bunji Kimura, Sanga&#x27;s coach at the time, visited Korea along with other scouts. In a practice game, the rising star did not attract their attention, whereas Park did. In an interview, Kimura said:

:In a practice match, a player arrested our eyes. Despite his injuries, Park&#x27;s performance was outstanding. Park played only about 20 minutes, however we could see his sense, physical strength, and his potential, so we accepted Park instead of the player we thought. This scout aroused a lot of criticism in Sanga because Park was unknown, to the point that I should resign.

In 2001, the club won the J2 League title and were promoted to the J1 League. In 2002, Park led the team to the final of the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, and in the final on 1 January 2003, he scored the equaliser with a header. The team went on to win the match 2–1 to become Emperor&#x27;s Cup champions for the first time in Sanga&#x27;s history. This was Park&#x27;s last game for Sanga. In January 2003, he left Sanga as Guus Hiddink invited him to play for PSV Eindhoven.

===PSV Eindhoven===
After the World Cup, Hiddink was appointed as manager of Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. In 2003, Park and South Korean teammate Lee Young-pyo moved to PSV in order to play under their mentor and former national team coach. While Lee quickly became a fixture in PSV&#x27;s starting line-up, Park struggled due to injuries. He had an operation to remove his meniscus after the injury and this affected his ability. He felt fear when the ball came to him because he was jeered at by PSV fans disappointed at his performance.

By the end of 2003–04 season, however, Park had begun to adapt to the Netherlands, both on and off the field. In the 2004–05 season, the departure of Arjen Robben to Chelsea afforded Park more starting opportunities and he quickly proved his worth to the team. Along with Johann Vogel, DaMarcus Beasley and Dutchmen Mark van Bommel and Philip Cocu, Park formed the backbone of PSV&#x27;s midfield play with his pace and passing. Having been a top contributor of goals and assists that season, the highlight of Park&#x27;s PSV career came when he scored the first goal against Italian team Milan in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals. PSV went on to win the home leg 3–1, but their 2–0 loss during the away leg meant Milan advanced to the final.

Nevertheless, thanks to these strong performances, Park was chosen, along with Andriy Shevchenko, Adriano, Samuel Eto&#x27;o and Ronaldinho, as one of the nominees for the 2005 UEFA Best Forward award. PSV fans were so enamoured with Park that they wrote a song about him entitled &quot;Song for Park&quot;, which was included on the official PSV album &quot;PSV Kampioen&quot;.

===Manchester United===
====2005–06 season====
In July 2005, Park chose to join Sir Alex Ferguson&#x27;s Manchester United. Park signed for the Premier League side for £4 million, subject to a medical and work permit. He became the second East Asian player to sign for Manchester United, after Dong Fangzhuo.

On 1 October 2005, Park largely contributed to a 3–2 victory against Fulham by assisting two goals and winning a penalty kick. On 18 October 2005, Park became the first Asian to ever captain Manchester United when he took the armband from Ryan Giggs as he replaced him during a Champions League home group match against Lille. Park&#x27;s first goal for Manchester United came on 20 December 2005, during a 3–1 win over Birmingham City in the League Cup fifth round. On 5 February 2006, Park appeared to have scored his first Premier League goal, against Fulham in United&#x27;s 4–2 victory at Old Trafford. The Premier League&#x27;s Dubious Goals Panel, however, later ruled that this was an own goal due to a deflection off the Fulham defender Carlos Bocanegra. On 9 April 2006, Park scored his first official league goal, netting the second of a 2–0 home win over Arsenal.

====2006–07 season====
Park injured his ankle during the match against Tottenham Hotspur on 9 September 2006 and returned to the field after three months. On 17 March 2007, he scored two goals against Bolton Wanderers, the first time he had scored more than once in a Premier League match. In April 2007, Park was sent to America for surgery on a recurring knee injury, putting an end to his season. Although sidelined by injury for most of the season, he recorded five goals and two assists in 14 appearances, and satisfied enough matches for a Premier League medal. However, Park started suffering chronic knee problems that eventually accelerated his retirement.

====2007–08 season====
On 1 March 2008, Park scored his first league goal of the 2007–08 season after returning from his long-term injury against Fulham. His lack of appearances had caused much controversy in South Korea, but he proved his worth when he delivered an assist to Wayne Rooney in the Champions League quarter-final match against Roma. On 29 April 2008, Manchester United advanced to the Champions League Final after beating Barcelona. Park, however, was excluded from the squad to face Chelsea in the final despite starting both legs of the semi-final; manager Sir Alex Ferguson later stated that leaving him out was one of the hardest decisions he had had to make throughout his managerial career.

====2008–09 season====

Early in the 2008–09 Premier League season, in an away match versus Chelsea, Park scored the only goal for United in a 1–1 draw on 21 September 2008, in a game which he also won the man of the match award. On 13 December 2008, he made his 100th appearance for Manchester United, starting in the match against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, the game ended 0–0. Park was included in the 23-man squad for the FIFA Club World Cup held at the end of 2008. He missed the semi-final but played the full 90 minutes in the final which they won 1–0 becoming the first English side to win the competition. On 7 March 2009, Park scored his first FA Cup goal in the 4–0 quarter-final win over Fulham at Craven Cottage, he latched onto a misplaced pass by Zoltán Gera eventually slotting it into the far corner for the fourth and final goal. On 15 April 2009, Manchester United advanced to semi-finals of the Champions League by defeating Porto 3–2 on aggregate. This made Park the only Asian player to be part of Champions League semi-finals on four occasions.

On 2 May 2009, Park verbally agreed to a new four-year £50,000-a-week deal at Manchester United, stating, &quot;I have no reason to move. I play at the best club in the world.&quot; Following this announcement, Park scored his second league goal of the season – and third overall – in a 2–0 away win against Middlesbrough. On 5 May 2009, Park scored his first Champions League goal for Manchester United in the second leg of the semi-final against Arsenal at the Emirates. He pounced on a slip by Kieran Gibbs and placed the ball over Manuel Almunia in the eighth minute, with the game ending 3–1 (4–1 on aggregate), advancing United to the Champions League final for the second year running. Park became the first Asian player in history to play in a Champions League final, although his team lost 0–2 to Barcelona.

====2009–10 season====
On 14 September 2009, Park signed a three-year contract extension with United, keeping him at the club until 2012. Ferguson said during the summer that he was always confident a deal would be done with Park, whose wages were estimated to be about £75,000 a week. Park started the 2009–10 season poorly. He had to be absent again for a long period after the international match against Senegal, because a long flight filled his knee with water in October 2009.

On 31 January 2010, Park scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season, hitting United&#x27;s third in a 3–1 win against Arsenal. His last goal also came against Arsenal at the Emirates in the same scoreline, coming in the 2008–09 Champions League, this was also the first time United had beaten Arsenal at the Emirates in the Premier League. On 10 March 2010, Park scored his first European goal of the season which was also his first for United in Europe at Old Trafford, hitting the third in a 4–0 win over Milan. This was also his second goal against Milan in the Champions League. On 21 March 2010, Park scored a crucial winner in the derby against Liverpool, turning in Darren Fletcher&#x27;s right-wing cross with a diving header. On 4 May 2010, Park committed himself to United by openly claiming he would like to spend the rest of career with them, saying, &quot;There is no reason to move to any other team.&quot; On 9 May 2010, Park netted on the final day of the season, scoring a close-range diving header against Stoke City to wrap up a 4–0 win.

====2010–11 season====

Park returned to the United team for the first time following the World Cup as he started against a League of Ireland XI in their final pre-season game on 4 August 2010. He marked this game with the first ever goal scored at the newly built Aviva Stadium, he then scored a second later on as United ended the game 7–1 winners.

On 22 September 2010, Park netted his first goal of the 2010–11 season as he scored United&#x27;s fourth of a 5–2 away win against Scunthorpe United in the third round of the League Cup. He then netted in the next round of the League Cup, scoring United&#x27;s second goal in a 3–2 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on 26 October 2010. Park scored his first two league goals of the season in a 2–1 home win over Wolves on 6 November, the second a late winner in the 93rd minute. On 27 November, Park scored United&#x27;s second goal in a 7–1 home victory over Blackburn Rovers. Park&#x27;s performance&#x27;s during November 2010 helped him gain the Player of the Month award from the club&#x27;s website. Park was then voted as United Player of the Month for December 2010, grabbing the award for the second month in a row. On 13 December, Park netted the only goal of the match against Arsenal, a looping header, his fourth goal in seven starts against them.

Park jetted off to captain South Korea in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup and missed seven games for United after the turn of the year. Upon his return from the subsequent tournament, he was ruled out for one month due to an hamstring injury which occurred during training. He returned to action for the first time since Boxing Day on 2 April, playing 64 minutes of a 4–2 away win over West Ham United. On 12 April 2011, Park scored his first goal since the turn of the year when he scored the winning goal in the Champions League quarter-final second leg tie against Chelsea, ending in a 2–1 win. On 8 May, Park assisted Javier Hernández&#x27;s opening goal with an accurate through-ball just 36 seconds after the start of the crucial match, which virtually decided United&#x27;s league title with a 2–1 victory over rivals Chelsea. On 22 May, he scored a goal and set up the second goal for Anderson in the last match of the season against Blackpool. Park played in another Champions League final, against Barcelona in 2011, which United lost 3–1.

====2011–12 season====
During the United States tour, Park scored in a 4–1 win against the New England Revolution and in a 7–0 win against Seattle Sounders FC. In the MLS All-Star Game, which Manchester United won 4–0, Park was named the man of the match after scoring a goal on the stroke of half-time.

On 28 August 2011, Park scored the sixth goal in an 8–2 home win against Arsenal, shortly after coming on as a second-half substitute. Park made his first start of the season in the Premier League in a 2–0 home win against Norwich City. Late on in the game he was involved in a neat one-two with Danny Welbeck in the creation of United&#x27;s second goal of the day, which Welbeck finished. On 26 December 2011, Park scored an early goal in United&#x27;s 5–0 home win against Wigan Athletic with a neat, side-foot finish from Patrice Evra&#x27;s cutback. He also won the penalty that wrapped up the win which Dimitar Berbatov scored to complete his hat-trick. In an FA Cup fourth round clash against Liverpool, Park scored an equalising goal with a low finish from a Rafael cross to make it 1–1; however, United went on to lose the tie.

On 5 February 2012, Park made his 200th appearance for Manchester United by coming on as a substitute in the 86th minute against Chelsea. He became the 92nd player in the history of the club to reach the milestone. On 23 February 2012, Park captained Manchester United for the first time from the beginning of a match in a 2–1 home defeat to Ajax in the UEFA Europa League. Although the match ended in a defeat, United still advanced to the round of 16 with a 3–2 aggregate score. On 30 April 2012, Park played in the Manchester derby, in a game that was widely perceived as crucial to Manchester United&#x27;s title defence. Park absented seven consecutive games by lagging behind in his positional competition at that time, but Ferguson trusted Park&#x27;s big game ability. However, Park&#x27;s performance was lethargic and he was criticized by the press. Manchester United lost the game 1–0 and Manchester City went on to win the Premier League title.

===Queens Park Rangers===
Having received less first-team football in his last season at Manchester United, Park moved to Queens Park Rangers for an undisclosed fee on 9 July 2012, signing a two-year contract with &quot;the Hoops&quot;. He made his debut in a 5–0 defeat at home to Swansea City on the opening day of the season on 18 August 2012.

Park&#x27;s first season with QPR was largely unsuccessful. Despite initially being made club captain, a combination of injuries and lack of form meant that Park was unable to have the kind of impact that was expected after his signing from Manchester United. Park finished the season with only 20 Premier League appearances and no goals, as QPR were relegated from the top flight of English football.

====Return to PSV and retirement====
With QPR no longer in the top flight, Park rejoined PSV on loan for the 2013–14 season. The deal was completed on 8 August 2013, but Park&#x27;s work permit application delayed his first game back for the club. He scored his first goal against Heracles Almelo at 86 minutes to tie the game on 24 August, his second match with PSV after his return. On 22 September 2013, Park led a 4–0 victory of team against Ajax with one goal and two assists.

On 14 May 2014, shortly after the conclusion of the season, Park announced his retirement, citing issues with his knee. Reflecting on his career, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m leaving with no regrets, I enjoyed playing football. I have achieved more than I thought I would. I&#x27;m truly grateful for all the support I have received and I will live the rest of my life thinking how I can pay it back.&quot;

==International career==
===Early career===
Park began his international career for the South Korea under-23 team as an 18-year-old defensive midfielder, selected by the manager Huh Jung-moo. On 27 May 1999, he made his debut against Chinese Taipei in the regional qualifier of 2000 Summer Olympics. On 5 April 2000, Park also made his senior international debut against Laos in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification. In September 2000, Park appeared all three matches in the group stage of 2000 Summer Olympics, and South Korea was eliminated by goal difference despite two victories in the group. In October 2000, Park played five matches at the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, where South Korea finished third.

===2002 World Cup===
When Guus Hiddink became the head coach of South Korea, Park&#x27;s position was shifted to that of a winger; since then, he has become a versatile player able to play in a variety of positions: central, right and left midfield, as well as wing-forward. Park showed his good condition by scoring against England and France in the friendly matches prior to the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Park scored a memorable goal during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. During the group stages South Korea had won their first game against Poland and drew against the United States. In order to advance, they had to manage a draw at the least against favoured Portugal side, which included Luís Figo and Rui Costa. The game was 0–0 until the 70th minute following two red cards against Portugal, when Park scored the match winner, controlling the ball with his chest and beating Sérgio Conceição before volleying it through the legs of Portugal goalkeeper Vítor Baía and into the net with his left foot. His goal eliminated Portugal and advanced South Korea into the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time. South Korea eventually made it to the semi-finals with victories over Italy and Spain, becoming the first Asian team to do so in the history of the FIFA World Cup. Park scored the second penalty in the quarter-final shoot-out against Spain, which South Korea won 5–3.

===2006 World Cup===
Park was selected for the South Korea under-23 squad for the 2002 Asian Games and won a bronze medal. Park also played for South Korea in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup during July. In the quarter-final, Park assisted the Seol Ki-hyeon&#x27;s goal, but South Korea lost 4–3 against Iran.

Park participated in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Park drew a crucial free kick that led to a red card for Jean-Paul Abalo, and Lee Chun-soo finished the chance with the equalising goal in the first Group G match, a 2–1 win over Togo. Park scored the equalising goal in the second Group G match against eventual finalists France and was voted man of the match. However, South Korea lost 2–0 against Switzerland in the last group match and failed to advance into the knockout stage.

===2010 World Cup===
On 11 October 2008, Park captained South Korea for the first time in a friendly, which Korea won 3–0 against Uzbekistan. He was the skipper for the remainder of the qualification campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and was South Korea&#x27;s top scorer with five goals. One of his goals was against Iran in Seoul, beating two defenders then scored with his left foot. South Korea advanced to the finals without a single defeat. On 24 May 2010, Park scored the winning goal with a solo effort in the rivalry held in Japan just before the World Cup.

On 12 June 2010, Park netted in his third consecutive World Cup, scoring the second goal in South Korea&#x27;s 2–0 win over Greece in their first group match, and celebrated the goal with a double windmill (swinging both arms round and round). He became the first Asian to score in three consecutive World Cup finals and became Asia&#x27;s joint all-time leading scorer in the World Cup with three goals, alongside compatriots Ahn Jung-hwan and Son Heung-min, as well as Sami Al-Jaber of Saudi Arabia. On 22 June 2010, South Korea drew 2–2 with Nigeria and Park won the man of the match award which is his fourth in the World Cup. South Korea successfully advanced to the knockout stage in the World Cup held in a foreign country for the first time, but lost 2–1 against Uruguay in the round of 16.

===2011 Asian Cup===
Park&#x27;s father, Park Sung-jong, said his son has planned to end his national team career after the 2011 AFC Asian Cup tournament in Qatar. Park travelled to the tournament on 26 December 2010 as squad captain. Park made his 100th international appearance in the semi-final match against Japan on 25 January 2011. Park induced a penalty kick which was finished as the opening goal but the match would not end in victory as they lost 3–0 during the penalty shoot-out following 2–2 after extra time. South Korea coach Cho Kwang-rae confirmed on 28 January that Park had retired from international duty as he was left out of their 3–2 third place play-off victory over Uzbekistan. Park was nominated as the tournament&#x27;s Most Valuable Player alongside Mark Schwarzer, Keisuke Honda and Server Djeparov. The award was eventually won by Japan midfielder Honda. On 31 January, Park confirmed his retirement from international football to make way for younger players with potential.

In January 2014, the national team manager Hong Myung-bo wanted Park&#x27;s return to the team for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, but Park rejected Hong&#x27;s suggestion because his knee was suffering to such an extent that he had to retire. Hong went to the Netherlands to persuade Park, but accepted Park&#x27;s refusal after checking the condition of Park&#x27;s knee.

==Style of play==
Park received much acclaim at Manchester United for his speed, off-the-ball movement, work rate and energy, which saw him deployed all over the midfield, including in the middle of the pitch, in a holding role, in a box-to-box role or on either wing, where he operated as a defensive winger, incessantly pressing the opponent players. He was also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, or even in a more advanced role as a second striker on occasion. Moreover, Park was known as a big game player, as he was often used by Sir Alex Ferguson in big league games or European games where there was an extra emphasis on defensive work. Ferguson once claimed that Park was one of the few players in the world capable of marking Lionel Messi.

In his 2013 autobiography, &quot;I Think, Therefore I Play&quot;, Italian midfielder Andrea Pirlo wrote that Park, who was deployed to man-mark him in matches for both PSV and Manchester United in the Champions League, was the one player that he could not get the better of. Pirlo wrote of Park, &quot;The midfielder must have been the first nuclear-powered South Korean in history, in the sense that he rushed about the pitch at the speed of an electron.&quot;

In May 2020, former teammate Wayne Rooney said that Park was as important to the Manchester United side of 2006–2009 as he and Cristiano Ronaldo were, commenting: &quot;It&#x27;s crazy but if you mentioned Cristiano Ronaldo to a 12-year-old, they would immediately say, &#x27;Yeah, he was a brilliant player for Manchester United.&#x27; But if you said &#x27;Ji-sung Park&#x27; they may not know who he was. Yet all of us who played with Park know he was almost as important to our success. That&#x27;s because of what Park gave to the collective and I want to talk about teams. They – not stars – are the most important thing in sport. People say our United team had all these great players. In reality our biggest strength was as a pure counterattacking machine. We would sit back in our shape, win the ball and just go. Park or Fletch [Darren Fletcher] – or both – were always involved. They were vital to us. Players like me, Ronaldo, Tevez got the headlines but they [Park and Fletcher] were as important as us if not more, because of what they did for the team. We knew that inside the dressing room — and also that because they were so good at sacrificing themselves, their actual individual quality was often overlooked.&quot;

In a promotional video for the Amazon Prime documentary &quot;Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In&quot; (2021), Ferguson said that not changing Park&#x27;s role in the second half of the 2011 Champions League final against Barcelona was &quot;a mistake&quot; and that, had he chose Park to specifically to man-mark Lionel Messi, they would have won that game.

==After retirement==
On 25 July 2014, Park participated in the K League All-Star Game, and was named the Most Valuable Player with a goal.

On 5 October 2014, it was announced that Park was to take up a role as a global ambassador for Manchester United.

In 2016, Park was selected to participate in the 17th edition of The FIFA Master - International Master in Management, Law and Humanities of Sport with a view to furthering his ambition of working in sports administration. He graduated from the course in July 2017.

In June 2018, he became a football commentator of Seoul Broadcasting System, and commented on South Korea&#x27;s matches at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

On 19 January 2021, he joined a K League 1 club Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors as the advisor to help the selection, nurture, scouting, and training system of players. At a similar time, he announced his resignation as United&#x27;s ambassador.

In December 2021, Park rejoined Queens Park Rangers, coaching the under-16s under the guidance of the technical director Chris Ramsey.

After serving as an advisor, Park became technical director at Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in September 2022. His career as a technical director for two years was unsuccessful. He scouted players and manager Dan Petrescu after getting authority, but Jeonbuk was in danger of relegation during the 2024 season. Petrescu resigned from the club in the middle of the season, and Park was also reinstated as an advisor.

On 20 October 2024, Park participated at the Nexon Icons Match, an exhibition game with two made-up teams of legendary footballers. He came off the bench to score a penalty kick in the 85th minute.

==Personal life==
===Family and relationships===
Park has identified Brazilian former holding midfielder Dunga as his football idol in his early years.

Influenced by his parents, Park became a Buddhist.

Park largely kept his personal life out of the spotlight and surprised the media by announcing his upcoming wedding to former television reporter Kim Min-ji at his retirement press conference. They married on 27 July 2014 in South Korea, and currently have a daughter and a son.

Park&#x27;s mother Jang Myung-ja and grandmother Kim Mae-shim both died on the same day of 12 January 2018.

===Charity works===
Park is the founder of the charitable foundation, JS Foundation, set up in 2011, which develop and launch charity programs that will support football infrastructure and also the necessaries of life. He is hosting the , contested between South Korea and guest youth teams, for development of the Korean youth players since 2015.

He has participated in the Asian Dream Cup annual charity event with a team entitled &quot;Park Ji-Sung and Friends&quot;. Fellow professionals who have played with him at the event include fellow South Korean internationals Ahn Jung-hwan and Lee Chung-yong, North Korean international Jong Tae-se and United teammate and former England captain Rio Ferdinand, while celebrities who have also done so include current cast members and alumni of the popular SBS variety show &quot;Running Man&quot;, including actor Song Joong-ki, singer Kim Jong-kook and rapper Gary. As a result, Park&#x27;s involvement in the 2012 edition marked his first appearance on the show over three episodes.

===Controversial chant===
During his time with Manchester United, the chant for Park, &quot;Park, Park wherever you may be,&quot; included the controversial lyrics generalizing and disparaging Koreans about eating dogs, which was deemed racist. Park, who originally did not know the chant&#x27;s meaning, still later said he accepted the chant since it meant no harm. The chant, however, was later used on other South Korean players Ji So-yun and Hwang Hee-chan by Manchester United fans even after Park&#x27;s retirement. When he participated in the anti-racism campaign of a South Korean YouTube channel in 2020, the South Korean fans criticized Park for tolerating and allowing the racist chant to be used continuously on other South Korean players. Park accepted the criticism and appealed to the United fans to stop singing his chant on behalf of Korean players and fans.

<doc id="628233" wikidata="Q2250439" url="?curid=628233" title="Under the Table and Dreaming">
<text>Under the Table and Dreaming is the debut studio album by the American rock band Dave Matthews Band, released on September 27, 1994. The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;What Would You Say&quot;, featuring John Popper of Blues Traveler on harmonica. Four other singles from the album followed: &quot;Jimi Thing&quot;, &quot;Typical Situation&quot;, &quot;Ants Marching&quot;, and &quot;Satellite&quot;. By March 16, 2000, the album had sold six million copies, and was certified six times platinum by the RIAA.

==Recording==
The acoustic guitar tracks on the album were played by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. During the recording sessions, Matthews and Reynolds would sit face-to-face with a piece of glass between them, playing the same guitar part. This was done twice for each song to yield a total of four acoustic guitar tracks, two apiece from Matthews and Reynolds. Producer Steve Lillywhite frequently turned the volume down on Matthews&#x27; parts and turned the volume up on Reynolds&#x27;, resulting in Reynolds&#x27; guitar playing being more prominent on the final album. Reynolds then overdubbed additional acoustic and electric guitar parts.

Matthews has stated during performances that the harmonica solo performed by John Popper on &quot;What Would You Say&quot; was done in only five to ten minutes, while Matthews was in the bathroom.

&quot;Granny&quot; was recorded for this release and Matthews wanted this to be the band&#x27;s first single, but the song never made it to any of the studio albums. A studio version of this track is included on the 2014 reissue of the album.

&quot;#34&quot; is the only instrumental track on the album although it was played live with lyrics on nine occasions in 1993, prior to the band taking it to the studio. The band originally recorded the song with lyrics, but they were removed from the final album cut.

The album&#x27;s title comes from a lyric of the song &quot;Ants Marching&quot;: &quot;[He] remembers being small / playing under the table and dreaming&quot;.

The album was dedicated to Matthews&#x27; older sister Anne, who was killed by her husband in 1994 in a murder–suicide. Included in the jewel case packet is a picture of Dave Matthews and one of Anne&#x27;s children.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Stereo Review&quot; noted that &quot;Matthews is a lucid dreamer and idealist whose folk-jazz forays call to mind Bruce Cockburn, another square peg who wins fans with a combination of artistry and perseverance.&quot; &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; determined that &quot;the band has a great sense of groove, evincing all the rhythmic discipline of a jazz band without ever losing its sense of the song.&quot;

==Track listing==

Note: Original CD editions of the album include 22 tracks of silence between &quot;Pay for What You Get&quot; and &quot;#34&quot;.

<doc id="628235" wikidata="Q318757" url="?curid=628235" title="Lee Chun-soo">
<text>Lee Chun-soo (; born 9 July 1981) is a South Korean retired football player. He played as a forward for the South Korea national team at the 2002 and 2006 editions of the 
FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==
=== Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i ===
Lee recorded seven goals and nine assists during 18 appearances in the 2002 K League, showing his talent in his first professional season. After becoming a World Cup semi-finalist and the top assist provider of the K League at the age of 19, he was named the Asian Young Footballer of the Year by the Asian Football Confederation.

In July 2003, he joined Real Sociedad, the runners-up of the 2002–03 La Liga, becoming the first Korean to play in La Liga. However, after a mediocre season, he was loaned out to fellow La Liga side Numancia, and ultimately returned to South Korea. He was unable to score in the La Liga in his two years there.

Lee rejoined Ulsan in mid-season. He especially scored a hat trick in the first leg of the championship final. He was subsequently named the K League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

The next year, he scored a hat-trick against Gamba Osaka at the A3 Champions Cup.

=== Feyenoord ===
In the summer of 2008, Lee joined Feyenoord of the Eredivisie. He got the second chance to play in Europe, but failed to adapt to the Netherlands. While he competed in Feyenoord, he was scammed in his country, and took a two-week vacation to solve the problem. He had difficulty concentrating on football due to his case of fraud, and Feyenoord officially announced Lee&#x27;s loan to South Korean team Suwon Samsung Bluewings on a one-year deal in July 2008.

==== Loan spells ====
Even in Suwon, his stint was ill-received: he performed poorly, had clashes with the coaching staff, and was banished from the K League. After a few months, Suwon released him from the banishment, and he could be loaned to Jeonnam Dragons on 26 February 2009.

In June 2009, he claimed he couldn&#x27;t reject his transfer according to his contract with Feyenoord if another club suggest a high salary to him, and he joined a Saudi club Al-Nassr in the middle of the season. However, the dual contract did not exist in reality, and he was prohibited from joining the K League again after Jeonnam got to know the truth.

=== Incheon United ===
In March 2010, he left Al-Nassr because the club did not give his wages for three months. He joined a J1 League club Omiya Ardija, and played in Japan for a year and a half.

After leaving Omiya Ardija, Lee did not join any foreign professional club for a year, and hoped to play in South Korea. Jeonnam Dragons released his indefinite banishment after watching his behavior including three apologies at the stadium. On 31 March 2013, he came back to the K League with Incheon United in a game against Daejeon Citizen 1,381 days after the last game with Jeonnam.

On 5 November 2015, he announced his retirement as a player. His retirement ceremony was held at half time of a World Cup qualifier between South Korea and Lebanon in March 2016.

==International career==
In 1999, Lee was selected for the South Korean under-20 team, participating in the Bangabandhu Cup. He scored five goals against Thailand in his debut game, and also scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Brazil.

Lee was also a member of the South Korean under-23 team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. In a group match against Morocco, he almost missed a crucial penalty, but succeeded in scoring from the rebound.

In the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in his country, Lee was a substitute of the South Korean national team, but showed good dribbles and defense when appearing. After main players were injured, Lee got an opportunity as a starter in the semi-finals against Germany. In this game, however, he was criticised for displaying a greediness for goal with little regard for teamwork, although he made a memorable shot saved by Oliver Kahn.

Unlike in the 2002 World Cup, Lee played as a starter in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He scored South Korea&#x27;s first goal with a free kick against Togo in a 2–1 win.

== After retirement ==
In 2005, he took a special seminar at Goyang Baekyang Middle School with Chung Mong-joon, president of the Korea Football Association.

In June 2014, he starred in an &quot;SNL Korea&quot; episode, when he played a parody of the game &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2014&quot; called &quot;GTA Winner Eleven 2014&quot; alongside Kim Min-kyo.

In December 2015, he appeared on the &quot;King of Mask Singer&quot; in Episode 38 as (with the stage name &quot;Know Thyself Socrates&quot;) show and displayed his singing skills.

As of March 2016, he is a commentator for JTBC3 Fox Sports.

In June 2021, Lee signed a contract with DH Entertainment.

In October 2024, he participated in the Nexon Icon Match in Korea as a striker team.

<doc id="628242" wikidata="Q359789" url="?curid=628242" title="Seol Ki-hyeon">
<text>Seol Ki-hyeon (; born 8 January 1979) is a South Korean former professional footballer who played as a winger, and who currently is the manager of Gyeongnam FC. He is also the first South Korean footballer to score in the history of the UEFA Champions League, during his time at Anderlecht.

== Club career ==
=== Career in Belgium ===
In July 2000, Seol joined a Belgian club Royal Antwerp. He became the second South Korean footballer to score in double figures during a season in Europe, following Cha Bum-kun. After a successful season with Royal Antwerp, Seol moved to Anderlecht in the same league. He scored a hat-trick in the space of 12 minutes in the 2001 Belgian Super-Cup. He also became the first South Korean player to score in the qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. He won the 2003–04 Belgian First Division with Anderlecht.

=== Wolverhampton Wanderers ===
In August 2004, Seol moved to England, joining a Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Wolverhampton manager at the time, Glenn Hoddle, preferred Seol as one of his first-choice forwards, using him in various roles such as striker, attacking midfielder and winger.

Disappointed by the failure of Wolves&#x27; promotion, Seol sought Premier League clubs interested in him before the 2006 FIFA World Cup despite having two years left on his contract. He was reported as saying &quot;At this stage, I&#x27;m frustrated not to be in the Premiership. I think there will be some good news after the World Cup.&quot;

===Reading===
Seol eventually joined newly promoted Premier League club Reading on 12 July 2006 for a reported transfer fee of £1.5 million. He was voted the Reading Player of the Month for August by fans after showing great performances early in the season. On 16 September 2006, he scored his first Premiership goal in a 2–1 win over Sheffield United. On 1 October 2006, he scored his second goal for Reading in a 1–0 win over West Ham United. His third goal for Reading, his first at home, came on 18 November 2006 in the 2–0 win against Charlton Athletic. However, his performance was not consistently kept during the rest of the season. He scored his fourth goal in the last game of the season against Blackburn Rovers.

===Fulham===
Seol left Reading for Fulham on 31 August 2007 for an undisclosed fee on a three-year contract, with Liam Rosenior going the other way. Reading boss Steve Coppell admitted that strained relations between him and Seol led to the move.

After his manager Lawrie Sanchez was replaced by Roy Hodgson, Seol wasn&#x27;t chosen as Hodgson&#x27;s player during the rest of the season. He scored his first goal for Fulham in a 2–1 defeat to Hull City on 16 August 2008, but he still didn&#x27;t show something special the next season. On 14 January 2009, he signed an initial six-month loan move to Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia with a view to moving permanently. However, he stated that he desired to stay at Fulham to win his place in the squad at the end of his loan deal.

Seol scored his second goal for the club in a Europa League qualifier against FK Vėtra on 30 July 2009, but he failed to made a twist for his status. On 15 January 2010, It was announced that his contract with Fulham was cancelled by mutual consent.

===Retirement===
Seol played for Pohang Steelers, Ulsan Hyundai, and Incheon United in the K League after leaving Fulham. During his K League career, he was criticised for having no respect for clubs and lying to fans. He announced his retirement on 2 March 2015 in order to become the interim manager of Sungkyunkwan University. His retirement ceremony took place in a friendly match between South Korea and Jamaica on 13 October 2015.

==International career==
Seol Ki hyeonwas a participant in 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cup. In the 2002 World Cup hosted by his country, he helped South Korea to reach the semi-finals as a starter. He also scored crucial equaliser in the round of 16 against Italy. He was nominated for the Ballon d&#x27;Or in that year.

==Managerial career==
On 26 December 2019, Seol was appointed as manager of Gyeongnam FC.

==Media==

<text>HMS &quot;Barfleur&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named after the Battle of Barfleur, which involved an Anglo-Dutch Fleet against the French in 1692.

&quot;Barfleur&quot; was built by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Limited on the Tyne. She was launched on 1 November 1943 and commissioned on 14 September 1944.

==Design and construction==
The Battle-class was developed as a result of operational experience in the early years of the Second World War, which had shown that the Royal Navy&#x27;s existing destroyers had inadequate anti-aircraft protection, and in particular, lacked a modern dual-purpose main gun armament, capable of dealing with both surface targets and air attack, with guns lacking the high elevation mountings necessary to deal with dive bombers. The resulting design was armed with two twin 4.5 inch high-angle gun-turrets of a new design mounted forward and a heavy close-in anti-aircraft armament, with 16 Battle-class destroyers ordered under the 1942 construction programme. &quot;Barfleur&quot; was ordered from Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Limited on 27 April 1942, and was one of three 1942 Battles ordered from Swan Hunter.

&quot;Barfleur&quot; was long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of normal and at full load. Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplied steam at and to two sets of Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of ( at full load). of fuel oil was carried, giving an endurance of at .

Two twin 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mark IV gun mounts, capable of elevating to 85 degrees, were mounted forward, while a single 4-inch gun was fitted behind the funnel for firing starshell. Close-in anti aircraft consisted of eight Bofors 40 mm guns in four twin stabilised Hazemayer mounts, with two power-operated 2-pounder guns on the bridge wings. Two quadruple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo-tubes were fitted, while four depth charge launchers and two racks were fitted, with 60 depth charges carried. The ship had a crew of 247 officers and other ranks.

&quot;Barfleur&quot;, named after the 1692 Battle of La Hogue, and the fifth ship of that name to serve with the Royal Navy, was laid down at Swan Hunter&#x27;s Wallsend shipyard on 28 October 1942, and was launched on 1 November 1943. Completion was delayed by the late availability of equipment, and while she was commissioned on 4 September 1944, the ship&#x27;s director control tower was not fitted, and she was not accepted into service until November that year.

==Service==
Following sea trials and workup of the ship, &quot;Barfleur&quot; underwent repair at Portsmouth in April 1945 before setting out for the Far East to join the 19th Destroyer Flotilla of the British Pacific Fleet. &quot;Barfleur&quot; was the only ship of the class to see action during the Second World War. She arrived in the Pacific in July, escorting the aircraft carrier from the British Pacific Fleet&#x27;s base at Manus Island to join Task Force 37 off Japan on 20 July. On 12 August 1945, &quot;Barfleur&quot; was selected as part of a token British force to remain off Japan while the majority of the British Pacific Fleet withdrew to prepare for Operation Olympic, the planned allied invasion of Kyushu. As such, she was present in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese signed the official surrender on the deck of the US battleship on 2 September 1945. &quot;Barfleur&quot; was then sent to Hokkaido to pick up ex-Prisoners of War and internees and ferry them to Tokyo Bay.

After the end of the war, &quot;Barfleur&quot; remained in the Far East with the 19th Flotilla, which was reinforced by five more Battle-class destroyers. &quot;Barfleur&quot; visited Sydney in October 1945, where she was repaired, and was refitted at Auckland from December 1945 to January 1946. &quot;Barfleur&quot; returned to the United Kingdom with the rest of her flotilla in 1947, being placed into reserve at Portsmouth on 15 January that year.

On 11 March 1953, &quot;Barfleur&quot; was recommissioned for service with the 3rd Destroyer Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. On 1 June 1953, it was reported that the power system of one of the ship&#x27;s gun mountings had been damaged in a possible case of sabotage. On 15 June 1953, &quot;Barfleur&quot; took part in the Fleet Review at Spithead in celebration of the Coronation of Elizabeth II as a representative of the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Barfleur&quot; was positioned in the middle of the destroyers and .

On 22 June 1953, &quot;Barfleur&quot; was ordered out of Malta to rescue survivors from a RAF Handley Page Hastings aircraft which had crashed in the Gulf of Sidra while on a flight between Castel Benito, Tripoli, Libya and RAF Habbaniya, Iraq. After picking up the sixteen passengers and crew, who were uninjured, the destroyer brought them back to Malta. In December 1954, &quot;Barfleur&quot; returned to British waters so that her crew could have Christmas leave at home.

The destroyer was involved in the Suez War in 1956, taking part in the Allied landings in early November. &quot;Barfleur&quot; returned home later in the year for the last time to join the Home Fleet.

In 1958, &quot;Barfleur&quot; was put in Reserve before being placed on the disposal list and broken up at Dalmuir in 1966.

<text>Ronald Mandel Lott (born May 8, 1959) is an American former professional football player in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons from 1981 to 1994.

Lott played college football for the University of Southern California (USC), and was honored as a consensus All-American. A first-round pick in the 1981 NFL draft, he played for the San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Raiders, New York Jets, and Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL. Lott was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000 and the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2023, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest of all time at the safety position in NFL history.

==Early life==
Ronald Mandel Lott was born on May 8, 1959, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Lott attended Eisenhower High School in Rialto, California. While in high school, Lott played football, baseball, basketball, and wrestled.

==College career==

Lott played for USC from 1977 to 1980. After lettering in limited time as a Freshman in 1977, Lott made the starting lineup in 1978 and recorded 3 interceptions, assisting the team to a 12–1 record and splitting the national championship with Alabama in 1978. The 1979 season saw more success for SC. Lott recorded 3 interceptions again as a key member of an elite secondary that included future NFL players Jeff Fisher, Dennis Smith, and Joey Browner. Along with an offense that included all American quarterback Paul McDonald, Heisman winner Charles White, future Heisman winner Marcus Allen, and four future NFL first round picks in the offensive line, he helped USC finish with a 11–0–1 record and a #2 ranking in both polls, In his senior season, Lott led the nation in interceptions (8), and return yards (166) earning himself unanimous All-American honors as the team went 8–2–1 with a final ranking of #11 while the team served a one-year NCAA probation.

In 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; included him on its All-Century Team for college football.

==Professional career==
===San Francisco 49ers (first stint)===
Lott was selected in the first round (8th overall) of the 1981 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers. The level of skill demonstrated by the 6-foot, 203-pound standout was instantly recognized, and from the very beginning of training camp he had the job as the 49ers&#x27; starting left cornerback. In his rookie season in 1981, he recorded seven interceptions, helped the 49ers to win Super Bowl XVI, and also became only the second rookie in NFL history to return three interceptions for touchdowns. His outstanding play resulted in his finishing second for rookie of the year honors, behind New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor.

Lott switched to the safety position in 1985. He had the tip of his left pinky finger amputated after the 1985 season when it was crushed while tackling running back Timmy Newsome, and a bone graft surgery would not have allowed him to start the 1986 season. While Lott told doctors to amputate the tip of his pinky, years later, he regretted having the procedure done saying he should have just had an operation to fix his finger. An injury sidelined him for the season&#x27;s last two games in 1986, but he still led the league with a career-best 10 interceptions, while recording 77 tackles, three forced fumbles, and two quarterback sacks. In his 10 years with the 49ers, Lott helped them win eight division titles and four Super Bowls: XVI (1981 season), XIX (1984), XXIII (1988), and XXIV (1989). He is one of five players that were on all four 1980s 49ers Super Bowl wins. The other four are quarterback Joe Montana, linebacker Keena Turner, cornerback Eric Wright, and wide receiver Mike Wilson.

===Los Angeles Raiders===
After his career with San Francisco, Lott signed as a free agent in 1991 with the Los Angeles Raiders. In 1991, he led the league in interceptions (8) for a second time.

===New York Jets===
Lott signed in 1993 with the New York Jets.

===San Francisco 49ers (second stint)===
He returned to the 49ers in 1995, but the injuries he had suffered over the previous four seasons continued to plague him, and he announced his retirement before the season began. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000, his first year of eligibility, and was also named to the NFL&#x27;s 75th Anniversary Team in 1994 and the 100th Anniversary Team in 2019.

==Player profile==
In his 14 NFL seasons, Lott recorded 8.5 sacks and 63 interceptions, which he returned for 730 yards and five touchdowns. He recovered 17 fumbles, returned them for 43 yards, and gained 113 yards on kickoff returns. Lott also played in 20 postseason games, recording nine interceptions, 89 tackles, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and two touchdowns. He was named All-Pro eight times, All-NFC six times, and All-AFC once. Lott had an uncanny awareness of how a play was developing, which allowed him to break up passes and earn a reputation as one of the hardest and most efficient open-field tacklers in the history of the league.

The trophy was first awarded in 2004. Lott was the guest of honor at a CYO fundraiser at Sharon Heights Country Club in Menlo Park, CA in May 2012 where he discussed the importance of helping the community. Lott credits the late Coach Ben Parks as a central figure in the development of his vigorous philanthropic work.

<doc id="628266" wikidata="Q940522" url="?curid=628266" title="Williams–Brice Stadium">
<text>Williams–Brice Stadium, popularly known as &quot;Willy B&quot;, is a football stadium located in Columbia, South Carolina. It serves primarily as the home of the South Carolina Gamecocks football team, but has also been the site of many concerts, state high school football championships, and various other events, including the annual Palmetto Capital City Classic between the Benedict Tigers and the South Carolina State Bulldogs until the last game in 2005. It is currently the 16th largest on-campus college football stadium in the NCAA and is located on the corner of George Rogers Boulevard and Bluff Road adjacent to the South Carolina State Fairgrounds.
Carolina football teams consistently attract standing-room-only crowds to Williams–Brice Stadium. The atmosphere on game days has been voted &quot;the best&quot; by SECsports.com, and has been noted as being among the loudest environments to play in by opposing players.

==History==
The stadium was originally built in 1934 with help of federal Works Progress Administration funds as Columbia Municipal Stadium. It was built to replace Melton Field, an aging wooden structure that was located where USC&#x27;s Thomas Cooper Library stands today. All USC football games except for the annual Thanksgiving matchup with Clemson had been played at Melton Field. The Clemson game was played at the South Carolina fairgrounds at the location that became Williams–Brice Stadium. Williams–Brice originally seated 17,600 people in what roughly corresponds to the lower level of the current facility&#x27;s east and west grandstand seats. In 1941, the stadium was deeded to USC and renamed Carolina Stadium.

One end of the stadium was filled in during the 1940s, turning it into a horseshoe. Capacity was almost doubled, to 34,000. More than a decade later, the other end was filled in, turning the stadium into a bowl. Capacity increased to 43,000.

Williams–Brice Stadium was sold out prior to the start of each of the last seven college football seasons and consistently ranks in the top 20 in average attendance and the top 15 in total attendance. For the 2008 season, the stadium was 17th in average attendance and 13th in total attendance.

On October 6, 2012, the stadium&#x27;s single-game attendance record was set when 85,199 fans watched the #6 Gamecocks beat #5 Georgia by the score of 35–7.

The stadium is considered one of the loudest venues in the country by both opposing players and college football pundits, with Josh Pate of 247Sports noting that &quot;when it&#x27;s 3rd down and three in Williams-Brice Stadium, you can&#x27;t hear anything [...] South Carolina fans more than do their part on game day to make that place a really, really intimidating environment&quot;. During a game against Florida in 2001, ESPN announcers indicated that they had to shout to hear each other&#x27;s comments inside the press box.

ESPN&#x27;s GameDay crew has broadcast its show four times (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006) from the State Fairgrounds across the street from the stadium. (In 2010, 2012, and 2014, GameDay was broadcast from The Horseshoe on campus.) ESPN also used a photo of the stadium in its advertising to promote its GameDay show throughout the 2005 college football season. On September 14, 2024 (vs. LSU) ESPN’s College Game Day broadcast from the newly renovated Gamecock Park area across Bluff Road from the stadium. Pat McAfee made several comments about the crowd’s enthusiasm. 

===Renovations===
The stadium&#x27;s first major renovation began in 1970, when the grass surface was replaced with AstroTurf. From 1971 to 1972, the west grandstand was completely rebuilt, with the addition of an upper deck. Capacity increased to 54,000. The renovation was funded by the estate of Martha Williams Brice and Thomas Hardin Brice, who left some of their estate to USC for stadium renovation and expansion. Her late husband, Thomas Hardin Brice, played football for the Gamecocks from 1922 to 1924. In their honor, the expanded stadium was officially renamed Williams–Brice Stadium on September 8, 1972 by a bequeath from their nephews Tom and Phil Edwards.

In 1982, the east grandstands were finally double-decked, increasing capacity to 72,400. However, unlike the west grandstand, the east grandstand was never rebuilt, and is the only remaining portion of the original 1934 structure. During the 1983–84 offseason, at the urging of new coach Joe Morrison, the university removed the AstroTurf and replaced it with natural grass.
Over the last 10 years, nearly $30 million of renovations and improvements have taken place at Williams–Brice Stadium, bringing the official capacity to 80,250. The addition of the upper deck in the south end zone includes &quot;The Zone,&quot; which is an banquet facility located in a prime seating location. The box seats, executive suites, and athletic training facilities at the stadium have also been upgraded. Just prior to the 2008 football season the stadium underwent a complete upgrade to the main sound system. During this upgrade the school added a large array of subwoofers under the scoreboard to enhance the &quot;feel&quot; of their entrance music (the theme song to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;). Installation of this system was done by local Columbia company ACS Sound and Lighting.
To open the 2012 season, the stadium featured a new Daktronics 36 foot high by 124 foot wide high definition video board, the 3rd largest in the SEC. Also unveiled was a new 52 acre tailgating area, landscaped with over 650 trees and featuring a 100 foot wide pathway, called the &quot;Garnet Way&quot;, that the team, band, and cheerleaders now walk through as they enter the stadium.

In 2015, the surface parking lot surrounding the stadium was replaced with a landscaped promenade named &quot;Springs Brooks Plaza&quot;, named for the family of Robert H. Brooks. The project included a half-mile of ornamental fencing, planting of 340 trees, and the installation of 220 light poles and 38 benches. Also added were a restroom building and a 12,000-square-foot structure housing ticket sales and a merchandise store in addition to a command center for EMS and police. The project expanded the number of ticket windows from five to eight, enlarged the student entrance and relocated parking for television trucks to improve the flow of pedestrian traffic. In 2020, three club areas were renovated, lowering capacity for the 2020 season to 77,559. In 2022, 250+ LED stadium lights with the capability to display multiple colors were installed. In addition, an expansion of the west main concourse, new elevators and new ribbon display boards were also a part of stadium renovations for that year.

==&quot;If it ain&#x27;t swayin&#x27;, we ain&#x27;t playin&#x27;&quot;==
The new east upper deck created some controversy during the 1983 season. Fans reported it was noticeably swaying—as much as a foot by some accounts. The swaying was especially pronounced during a game in which the Gamecocks routed Southern Cal 38–14. Joe Morrison was subsequently quoted as saying, &quot;If it ain&#x27;t swayin&#x27;, we ain&#x27;t playin&#x27;&quot;—a phrase that eventually made it onto bumper stickers and other items, and is still a popular saying today. Giant shock absorbers were installed under the east upper deck for the 1987 season; however, during the 1988 season, many spectators reported seeing a ripple effect across the east upper deck when the marching band played the song &quot;Louie Louie.&quot; The university indicated that the sway or ripple was safe. To this day, the east upper deck still sways when fans jump up and down. In addition, several parts of the stadium have been known to vibrate due to the decibel levels generated during a typical game.

We hope this concert will remind the nation that we need to change the way we think about the food we eat and the people who grow it. It&#x27;s important that we have someone there growing the food who cares for the land.&quot; The concert took place on October 12 and included Columbia&#x27;s own Hootie and the Blowfish (who jammed onstage with Willie), Neil Young, the Beach Boys, John Mellencamp, Tim McGraw, Martina McBride, Deana Carter, Grand Ole Opry star John Conlee, Rusted Root, and Jewel.

==Traditions==
Popular game day traditions include:
*The playing of the &quot;Dawn&quot; section of &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;, the theme from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, as the Gamecocks run onto the field at the start of every game, which &quot;Sporting News&quot; called &quot;the most exciting pregame entry&quot; in college football.
*The playing of the Darude song &quot;Sandstorm&quot; before the opening kickoff and after Gamecock touchdowns, leading the crowd into a frenzy, often even causing the press box to noticeably shake. Beginning in the 2022-23 season, this is accompanied by an LED light show. 
*Nationally recognized mascot, Cocky, roaming around the stadium throughout games with his trademark spirit and attitude. Cocky&#x27;s &quot;Magic Box&quot; entrance at Williams–Brice Stadium is one of the many things that Cocky does to fire up the fans. Cocky won the UCA (Universal Cheerleading Association) Mascot Championship in 1986 and 1994. Cocky was also selected as the Capital One National Mascot of the Year for 2003.
*Fans joining in on many cheers and chants, including the popular &quot;GAME&quot; (shouted by the west side of the stadium) followed by &quot;COCKS&quot; (shouted by the east side).
*Fans singing and dancing to &quot;Go Carolina,&quot; &quot;USC Fight Song,&quot; various renditions of &quot;2001,&quot; and many other songs played by The University of South Carolina Marching Band. As one of the most well-known college bands in the country, the 375-member &quot;Mighty Sound of the Southeast&quot; continually performs music featuring guard, percussion, and dance units.

*Tailgating is a favorite pastime for fans attending games at Williams–Brice, and many tailgaters consider pre-games at the stadium as one of the best atmospheres in the nation. The grounds around the stadium, including the State Fairgrounds, provide plenty of real estate for tailgating. Many clubs have also bought private property in the area and erected tailgating shelters. In 1990, a unique form of tailgating called the Cockaboose Railroad arrived in Columbia. 22 immovable cabooses line an unused railroad track behind the south end of the stadium, and each Cockaboose provides private party space and cable television. There are also 18 additional cabooses and 4 passenger cars farther away from the stadium. Four condominium developments recently built around the stadium also cater primarily to Carolina football fans along with several tailgate pavilions with permanently deeded spaces. 
*The band plays the Alma Mater at the end of every football game and is the last song to be played in Williams–Brice until the next game.
