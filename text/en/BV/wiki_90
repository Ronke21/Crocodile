<text>Graham George Linehan (; born May 1968) is an Irish comedy writer and anti-transgender activist. He created or co-created the sitcoms &quot;Father Ted&quot; (1995–1998), &quot;Black Books&quot; (2000–2004), and &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; (2006–2013), and he has written for shows including &quot;Count Arthur Strong&quot;, &quot;Brass Eye&quot; and &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. Early in his career, he partnered with fellow writer Arthur Mathews. Linehan has won five BAFTA awards, including Best Writer, Comedy, for &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; in 2014.

After an episode of &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; was criticised as transphobic, Linehan became involved in anti-transgender activism. He argues that transgender activism endangers women, and he has likened the use of puberty blockers to Nazi eugenics. Linehan says his views have lost him work and ended his marriage.

==Early life==

Linehan was born in Dublin in 1968. He attended Catholic University School, a Roman Catholic secondary school for boys in Dublin.

==Comedy career==

In the 1980s, Linehan joined the staff of the Dublin politics and music magazine &quot;Hot Press&quot;, where he met his future writing partner, Arthur Mathews. In their early collaborations, they created segments in sketch shows including &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;Harry Enfield &amp; Chums&quot;, &quot;The All New Alexei Sayle Show&quot;, &quot;The Day Today&quot; and the Ted and Ralph characters in &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. They continued their collaboration with &quot;Paris&quot; (one series, 1994), &quot;Father Ted&quot; (three series, 1995–1998), and the first series of the sketch show &quot;Big Train&quot;. They also wrote the &quot;Dearth of a Salesman&quot; episode for the series &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Run&quot;, which featured the character Gareth Cheeseman. In late 2003, Linehan and Mathews were named one of the 50 funniest acts to work in television by &quot;The Observer&quot;. &quot;Father Ted&quot; won BAFTA awards for Best Comedy in 1996 and 1999.
Linehan wrote for the satirical series &quot;Brass Eye&quot; (1997), &quot;Blue Jam&quot; (1997–1999) and &quot;Jam&quot; (2000)&quot;.&quot; With the actor Dylan Moran, he created the sitcom &quot;Black Books&quot; (2000–2004). Linehan wrote and directed the 2006 Channel 4 sitcom &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;, in which he sought to move away from the British trend towards mockumentary comedies. Unlike many series of the time, it was recorded before a studio audience. In November 2008, he was awarded an International Emmy for &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;. In 2013, he wrote and directed the sitcom &quot;The Walshes&quot;. He co-wrote the first series of the BBC sitcom &quot;Motherland&quot; and directed its pilot episode. In 2014, Linehan won his fifth BAFTA, for Best Writer, Comedy, for his work on &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;. He was also nominated for &quot;Count Arthur Strong&quot;.

In 2018, Linehan and Mathews announced plans for a &quot;Father Ted&quot; musical. Linehan said it would finish the series as they had planned it before the death of the lead actor, Dermot Morgan. The musical was cancelled by producers following the controversy over Linehan&#x27;s views on transgender rights. In December 2024, Linehan announced plans to move to Arizona to work on a sitcom and create a production company with the comedians Rob Schneider and Andrew Doyle.

===Television appearances===

Both Linehan and Mathews have made cameos in programmes they have written. They also made an appearance in the sitcom &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; as two Irish TV producers considering Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) for a contract.

Linehan has also appeared in &quot;The Day Today&quot; and in two episodes of &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&quot;, and has had cameos in &quot;Black Books&quot; (series one, episode two, as &quot;I love books&quot; Guy, and series one, episode five as Fast Food Customer), and the &quot;Father Ted&quot; episodes &quot;Good Luck Father Ted&quot;, &quot;Entertaining Father Stone&quot;, &quot;Flight Into Terror&quot;, &quot;Cigarettes, Alcohol and Rollerblading&quot; and &quot;Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep&quot;. He had cameos in four episodes of &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;: as Messy Joe&#x27;s Restaurant Musician, in series one, episode three; the blind sorcerer, in series two, episode six; as a member of the audience for Jen&#x27;s speech, in series three, episode four; and as Beth Gaga Shaggy, in series four, episode three. He appeared in the Identity Parade round of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. He also appeared in the pilot of &quot;Little Britain&quot;, as well as in series one, episode four, as a bystander who gets in the way of character Kenny Craig when he is attempting to hypnotise, from a distance, a man whose car he has crashed into. He also appeared in series one, episode five, in which he played a journalist called Roy Sloan (from &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;) during a conference with Prime Minister Michael Stevens (Anthony Head).

In 2007, a documentary about Linehan, his life and his career was produced by Wildfire Films for RTÉ One. This documentary explored the art, craft and deeply competitive business of creating contemporary television comedy. The programme featured interviews with several of the UK&#x27;s most successful television comedy writers and performers including Steve Coogan, Matt Lucas, David Walliams, Paul Whitehouse, Griff Rhys Jones and Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon, all of whom have worked with Linehan. It was directed by Adrian McCarthy and produced by Martha O&#x27;Neill and Adam Rynne.

Linehan was one of the writers interviewed by Charlie Brooker in 2008 in a special interview episode of the fifth series of &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Screenwipe&quot; programme, and again on &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Gameswipe&quot; in 2010. In 2011, Linehan appeared with several members of the cast in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Father Ted Night&quot;, an evening of the writer&#x27;s favourite episodes and two retrospective documentaries. He also appeared as a guest panellist on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in 2011 and again in 2012, and he made his debut as a guest on the BBC show &quot;QI&quot; in the 11th series (K series) in 2013, receiving a score of −19.

=== Memoir ===
Linehan&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Tough Crowd: How I Made and Lost a Career in Comedy&quot;, was published in October 2023. The month before publication, it had the second-highest number of pre-orders for a book on Amazon. It reached number ten on the Sunday Times bestseller list after it was published. Linehan wrote of his childhood, career, and his five years as an anti-transgender activist.

Reviewing &quot;Tough Crowd&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Fiona Sturges wrote that while Linehan&#x27;s account of his comedy career has &quot;verve and charm&quot;, the memoir &quot;reads less like the story of a man heroically cleaving to his principles than a document of a peculiar and self-defeating obsession, a sad coda to a once towering talent&quot;. In a review in &quot;The Critic,&quot; Ben Sixsmith described &quot;Tough Crowd&quot; as &quot;very entertaining&quot; with &quot;some valuable insights into comedy&quot;, but that Linehan &quot;admits to losing his rag in a way that might not always be productive&quot;. In &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Houman Barekat wrote that the memoir had &quot;two distinct narratives&quot;, concluding that &quot;&quot;Tough Crowd&quot; is a discomfiting read not because it contains hard-hitting home truths, but because its author clearly hasn’t worked through his issues&quot;. For &quot;The Spectator&quot; Debbie Hayton wrote that &quot;This is a book of two halves&quot; and that it &quot;may well appeal to two completely different audiences&quot;, concluding that &quot;if they want to understand the man they need to read it all.&quot; Louis Chilton of The Independent described the book as &quot;a strange, sad read... that crumbles under the slightest scrutiny&quot;.

===Other work===
Linehan&#x27;s children voiced characters in the 2012 &quot;Adventure Time&quot; episode &quot;Goliad&quot;, with Linehan directing the children while taking the producers&#x27; instructions over the phone. He planned to write a sequel episode, and sent versions of the story to the production team. The episode was never made as &quot;Adventure Time&quot; ended in 2018. In 2023, Linehan performed a stand-up comedy set at the Backyard Comedy Club in London.

== Anti-transgender activism ==

Linehan is involved in anti-transgender activism. He began making anti-trans statements online after the 2008 episode &quot;The Speech&quot; of &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;, written by Linehan, was widely criticised as transphobic and sexist. Critics said it used gender stereotypes and trivialised violence against transgender women. The episode features a man who learns that his girlfriend is transgender and gets into a fight with her. Channel 4 removed the episode from syndication and streaming in 2020. Linehan felt the joke was &quot;harmless&quot; and says he did not understand the &quot;ferocity&quot; of the response, arguing that a transphobic character did not make him or the episode transphobic.

Linehan said he was sceptical of gender self-identification, objecting to &quot;privileged white people saying you must accept anyone who says they are a woman&quot;. He said that &quot;anyone suffering from gender dysphoria needs to be helped and supported&quot;, but he voiced concern over early transgender intervention for children. He used the social network Twitter to criticise &quot;trans ideology&quot;, which he believes misrepresents transgender people and lesbians.

=== Before first Twitter ban ===

In 2018, Linehan praised anti-transgender protesters at that year&#x27;s London Pride event who had carried banners and flyers saying that &quot;transactivism erases lesbians&quot;, calling them &quot;heroes&quot;. Later that year, Stephanie Hayden, a transgender woman, sued Linehan for harassment. Hayden alleged that Linehan had shared photos on Twitter of Hayden&#x27;s family and her life before transition, suggested she was a criminal, and repeatedly misgendered and deadnamed her. Linehan in turn alleged that Hayden publicised several private addresses linked to his family to silence him. Police issued Linehan a verbal warning not to contact Hayden.

In a December 2018 interview with Derrick Jensen, Linehan said: &quot;I&#x27;m now in a position where I can answer the question honestly of &#x27;if you were around at the time of something terrible happening like Nazism, or whatever it happened to be, would you be one of the people who said &quot;no, this is wrong&quot;, despite being opposed?&#x27;&quot; He also said the trans movement provides &quot;cover&quot; for &quot;fetishists, con men, and simply abusive misogynists&quot;. In an interview with the BBC television programme &quot;Newsnight&quot; in February 2020, Linehan said that the Tavistock Centre&#x27;s practice of treating children with puberty blockers such as Lupron was comparable to Nazi eugenics and experiments on children. Following this interview, Eric Pickles, the United Kingdom Special Envoy for Post-Holocaust Issues, accused Linehan of trivialising the Holocaust.

In January 2019, Linehan expressed concern over the news that Mermaids, a charitable advocacy organisation for transgender children and teenagers, was to receive a £500,000 lottery grant to open clinics around the United Kingdom. He posted to the blogging website Mumsnet encouraging its users to lobby the National Lottery Community Fund to reverse its decision. The grant was reviewed and went ahead. In response to Linehan, YouTuber Hbomberguy held a 57-hour fundraising livestream that raised £270,000 more for Mermaids. The same year, British journalist Dawn Foster accused Linehan and others of targeting a National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) employee who had been responsible for hiring model and activist Munroe Bergdorf, a transgender woman. Foster called the online abuse &quot;transphobic&quot; and &quot;flatly homophobic&quot;. Journalist Chris Godfrey called the treatment of the employee &quot;insidious homophobia&quot;.

In June 2020, Linehan criticised comments about author J. K. Rowling after she made comments that were called transphobic. He linked to a blog post featuring screenshots of abuse Rowling had received, describing those who wrote them as &quot;ignoring the abuse received by women who speak out against gender ideology&quot; and &quot;literally useless&quot;. Hozier, tagged in Linehan&#x27;s tweets due to his trans-rights advocacy, responded by saying Linehan was conducting an &quot;obsessive little culture war&quot;.

=== Twitter ban and evasions ===
On 27 June 2020, Linehan&#x27;s Twitter account was permanently suspended after what Twitter called &quot;repeated violations of our rules against hateful conduct and platform manipulation&quot;. In December, Linehan evaded the suspension with an account posing as a transgender man. He used the account to call Colm O&#x27;Gorman &quot;a traitor to women, gay people and yourself&quot; for signing an open letter published by the Transgender Equality Network of Ireland. The account was banned but Linehan said he had created another.

In February 2021, Linehan created a fake account on the lesbian dating app Her and publicly posted screenshots of non-binary people and trans women using it. The developers of Her clarified that transgender women are welcome on the app. In March 2021, Linehan gave oral evidence to the Communications and Digital Committee of the House of Lords on the subject of freedom of expression online, discussing his Twitter ban.

In an interview in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; that month, Linehan ruled out working with Channel 4 again as they would not return the controversial &quot;IT Crowd&quot; episode to broadcast, and he said he would not work with the BBC as they had depicted a transgender lesbian couple, which Linehan described as &quot;a heterosexual couple&quot;, in a CBeebies video. Ahead of the 2022 Australian federal election in May, Linehan used his online platforms to rally international support for the Liberal Party candidate Katherine Deves, who had attracted controversy for anti-trans comments. In September 2022, Linehan said that his anti-transgender activism had led him to question the safety of COVID-19 vaccinations and the scientific consensus on climate change &quot;because I&#x27;ve been lied to so conclusively by all the people I used to trust&quot;.

In interviews in 2022 and 2023, Linehan said the debate over transgender issues had &quot;consumed his life&quot;: it had lost him work, made him financially destitute, and ended his marriage. He said the &quot;Father Ted&quot; musical, on which he had been depending financially, was cancelled when the production company decided his involvement would make it impossible to stage. He had previously called for all people working on the musical to sign a declaration agreeing with some of his views on trans people while describing clashes he was having with colleagues over their views on trans rights, and read out a letter he had written to collaborators saying: &quot;I don’t think you all have my back as collaborators or as business partners or as friends. Far from being on the wrong side of history, JK Rowling and I have been proved right over and over again that this is a poisonous ideology that is destroying lives.&quot; 

Linehan blamed cancel culture for his situation, and said: &quot;Every comedian at the moment is living under a kind of state of permanent blackmail ... There&#x27;s a few hot-button issues where you have to follow a certain line, and if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll be destroyed.&quot; In 2023, he denied disliking transgender people, but said using their preferred pronouns was &quot;immoral&quot;. He said he did not have a problem with &quot;men calling themselves women&quot; and that &quot;as we keep pointing out, we are only talking about places where conflict arises&quot;.

=== Post-Twitter reinstatement ===

Linehan&#x27;s Twitter account was restored in December 2022, following the takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk, who relaxed many of Twitter&#x27;s content policies and announced an amnesty to restore suspended accounts. He also attacked Ian &quot;H&quot; Watkins of Steps, tweeting: &quot;What may connect him to a man serving 22 years for raping and torturing a 10-year-old girl?&quot;, on the basis that Watkins had used a tool to block transphobes.

In April 2023, Linehan was again banned from Twitter, following his appearance at an anti-trans event called Let Women Speak in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He had tweeted the words &quot;Durr imm gonna kill em&quot; in response to a Twitter user who referenced counter-protestors at the Belfast event. Linehan&#x27;s account was reinstated days later.

In July 2023, Linehan tweeted that David Tennant was an &quot;abusive groomer&quot; after Tennant wore a T-shirt saying &quot;Leave Trans Kids Alone You Absolute Freaks&quot;. In August, during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Linehan and other comedians performed a stand-up comedy show outside the Scottish Parliament after his original venues cancelled his booking over his views. Some supporters of Linehan attended the show and criticised the Edinburgh Fringe as oversensitive. Linehan also threatened to sue the first venue that cancelled his gig. On 1 October, he attended the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, stating in a speech that he was &quot;the most cancelled person in this room&quot;. On 3 October, he said he had been dropped by his television agent, Independent Talent, which also represented Tennant. On 12 November 2023, he appeared on &quot;This Week&quot; on Ireland&#x27;s national radio station, RTÉ, to talk about his claim of being cancelled, defend his anti-trans activism, and to promote his memoir &quot;Tough Crowd&quot;.

In February 2025, a court case ruled that Linehan had made defamatory remarks about Scottish actor David Paisley.

== Personal life ==
Linehan married English writer Helen Serafinowicz, the sister of the actor Peter Serafinowicz, in 2004. They have two children and lived in Norwich. In October 2015, the couple worked with Amnesty International on a campaign film calling on the Irish government to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which &quot;acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right&quot;. The couple revealed their decision for Helen to abort a foetus with acrania while living in England in 2004, and their discovery that undergoing the procedure in Ireland would have been an offence carrying a maximum 14-year prison sentence.

Linehan&#x27;s marriage to Serafinowicz ended in 2020 as a result of his anti-transgender activism, and he moved to London. He said the relationship had suffered because of his legal and financial problems and visits from the police. In 2023, Linehan said he had been on anti-anxiety medication for &quot;five or six years&quot; since having first received legal threats from trans rights activists. He said he had contemplated suicide in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdowns, as he had lost work and relationships and was &quot;completely alone&quot;.

Linehan is an atheist. In January 2009, he helped to publicise the Atheist Bus Campaign. He is also an honorary associate of the National Secular Society. In 2018, Linehan underwent successful surgery for testicular cancer.

Linehan has been an active Twitter user, calling it &quot;part of [his] nervous system&quot; in a 2015 interview. On 13 February 2009, Linehan hosted the first BadMovieClub on Twitter which repeated the next day at midnight, hosted by Phill Jupitus. In August 2009, in response to criticism of the National Health Service by the US Republican Party, Linehan created the #welovetheNHS campaign on Twitter. In 2011, he perpetrated a Twitter hoax that Osama bin Laden was a fan of &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;.

<text>The Bofors 37 mm anti-tank gun was an anti-tank gun designed by Swedish manufacturer Bofors in the early 1930s originally for Swedish use. It was exported to several countries during the 1930s of which several bought licences to produce it themselves. The gun was used in several conflicts but most of its fame comes from its use in the Spanish Civil War and the Winter War where it was used very successfully against light tanks and armored cars among other targets. Beyond its use as an infantry gun it was also used as the main armament in several armored cars and tanks such as the Dutch M39 Pantserwagen and the Polish 7TP to name a few. As the armor of tanks was increased during World War II the gun very quickly became obsolete as an anti-tank gun but was still used effectively as an infantry support gun for the entirety of the war, and well into the Cold War. This was due to its high fire rate, great mobility and effective high explosive shells.

==Development history==
The gun was initially designed by Swedish manufacturer Bofors, mainly for export purposes. It was likely derived from Rheinmetall&#x27;s 3,7-cm Tak, the predecessor of 3.7 cm Pak 36. The first prototype was built in 1932; the development process continued until 1934. The Netherlands were the first to purchase the gun (order for 12 pieces was placed in 1935) and were followed by many other countries. Licensed copies were produced in Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Poland.

The barrel was of monobloc type, with semi-automatic vertical sliding breech block and small muzzle brake. It was mounted on a split trail carriage which had suspension and metal wheels with rubber tires. To give the crew some protection from firearms and shell fragments, the gun was equipped with a 5 mm thick shield, with a folding lower plate.

==Operational history==
The Bofors gun saw combat for the first time in Spanish Civil War, where it could easily pierce the armor of contemporary light tanks.
The Polish guns were actively used during the German and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. Volhynian Cavalry Brigade equipped with the Bofors 37 mm antitank gun beat the German Panzer Divisions in one of the first battles of the invasion; the Battle of Mokra. At that time, the armored forces of the Wehrmacht consisted mainly of light Panzer I and Panzer II tanks, which were vulnerable to the Bofors gun. Early models of the Panzer III and Panzer IV could also be penetrated at ranges up to 500 m. After Poland was occupied, most of the guns fell into the hands of the German and Soviet armies. The weapon was proven obsolete by 1941 during Operation Barbarossa.

Even though only one Bofors AT-gun was in action in the invasion of Denmark, it damaged two tanks, and shot the tracks off another tank, before its crew were either wounded or killed by a German tank destroyer which drove over the gun. The gun is now at the Tøjhusmuseet in Copenhagen.

During the Winter War, the Finnish guns were successfully used against Soviet tanks such as T-26, T-28 and BT. However, in the Continuation War the gun was found to be ineffective against the T-34 and KV and was relegated to an infantry support role.

The gun was used to equip the British forces in North Africa, where it made up for the lack of the QF 2-pounder anti-tank guns after the Fall of France. It was often carried &quot;portee&quot; on the back of a vehicle.

Bofors guns were also employed in World War II by Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Yugoslavia and USSR, but there are no detailed reports of their use.

==Summary==
When it was introduced, the Bofors 37 mm anti-tank gun was an effective weapon and an international success, able to deal with contemporary tanks. Its performance, light weight and high rate of fire made it a popular anti-tank weapon in the pre-war Europe. Introduction of better armored tanks early in World War II, however, made the gun obsolete (as with other similarly performing weapons such as the German 3.7 cm Pak 36 and the United States 37 mm Gun M3).

== Ammunition ==
There were many different ammunition types available for the Bofors 37 mm at gun. It could fire all common types of ammunition and some rare types such as APDS and white phosphorus incendiary.
== Operators ==
;: A version with slightly more powerful cartridge was manufactured by the Danish state arsenal &quot;Hærens Vaabenarsenal&quot; in 1936-37 as 37 mm fodfolkskanon M. 1934. In 1945 Danish units returning to their homeland brought with them a few Swedish model 1938 guns.
;: As 37 PstK/36. 114 pieces were bought from Bofors in 1938–39 (some of them were returned to Sweden in 1940), 42 Polish-made guns were received from Germans in 1940–41 and 355 were produced by local manufacturers &quot;Tampella&quot; and VTT (&quot;Valtion Tykkitehdas&quot; – State Artillery Factory) in 1939–41. When the Winter War began in November 1939, the Finnish Army had 98 guns of the type. A tank version was also used to equip Finnish 6-tonne tanks. The gun remained in the Finnish Army inventory listings until 1986.
;: Used Polish guns captured in 1939 as 3,7 cm PaK 36(p) and Danish guns captured in 1940 as 3,7 cm PaK 157(d).
;: 12 pieces were ordered from Bofors in 1935. Later another 24 (or more) were procured. All these were used for Dutch armoured cars: 24 Landsverk types L180 and L181 as well as 12 DAF Pantrado cars.

;: As wz.36. 300 guns were bought in Sweden and hundreds more were produced by SMPzA (&quot;Stowarzyszenie Mechaników Polskich z Ameryki&quot;) in Pruszków, some of them exported. When World War II began, the Polish Army had 1,200 pieces. A tank variant, designated wz.37, was mounted in 7TP (single-turret version), 9TP (prototypes) and 10TP tanks. 111 of them were produced before the war.
;: 669 pieces (former Polish ones) were bought from Germany.
;: Some guns bought by the Republicans were used during the Spanish Civil War.
;: Adopted in 1937 as 37 mm infanterikanon m/34 (infantry gun model 1934). Modernized version was adopted in 1938 as 37 mm pansarvärnskanon m/38 (anti-tank gun model 1938) and 37 mm pansarvärnskanon m/38 F.&quot; The latter was also produced in a tank gun variant – 37 mm Kanon m/38 stridsvagn&quot;; it was fitted to Landsverk Strv m/38, Strv m/39, Strv m/40 light tanks and to the Strv m/41, a Swedish version of the Czech TNH light tank.
;: A number of Swedish m/34 ordered by Anglo-Egyptian Sudan were adopted as &quot;Ordnance QF 37 mm Mk I&quot;.
;: Several dozen Polish guns fell into Soviet hands. Late in 1941 these pieces were issued to Red Army units to make up for the lack of anti-tank guns.

<doc id="630631" wikidata="Q475061" url="?curid=630631" title="Districts of Thailand">
<text>An amphoe (sometimes also &quot;amphur&quot;, , )—usually translated as &quot;district&quot;—is the second level administrative subdivision of Thailand. Groups of &quot;amphoe&quot; or districts make up the provinces, and are analogous to counties. The chief district officer is &quot;Nai Amphoe&quot; (). &quot;Amphoe&quot; are divided into &quot;tambons&quot;, (), or sub-districts.

Altogether Thailand has 928 districts, including the 50 districts of Bangkok, which are called &quot;khet&quot; (เขต) since the Bangkok administrative reform of 1972. The number of districts in provinces varies, from only three in the smallest provinces, up to the 50 urban districts of Bangkok. Also the sizes and population of districts differ greatly. The smallest population is in Ko Kut (Trat province) with just 2,042 citizens, while Mueang Samut Prakan (Samut Prakan province) has 509,262 citizens. The &quot;khet&quot; of Bangkok have the smallest areas—Khet Samphanthawong is the smallest, with only 1.4 km2—while the &quot;amphoe&quot; of the sparsely populated mountain regions are bigger than some provinces. Umphang (Tak province) at 4,325.4 km2 is the largest and also has the lowest population density. The average area of a district in Thailand is about , while its average population of a district in Thailand is about 75,345 people.

The names of &quot;amphoe&quot; are usually unique, but in a few cases different Thai names have the same form in English due to the flaws of the romanization system. The notable exception, however, is the name Amphoe Chaloem Phra Kiat, which was given to five districts created in 1996 in celebration of the 50th anniversary of King Bhumibol Adulyadej&#x27;s accession to the throne. &quot;Chaloem Phra Kiat&quot; (เฉลิมพระเกียรติ) means &#x27;in commemoration of&#x27; or &#x27;in honour of&#x27; a royal family member.

== Local administration ==
Each district is led by a district chief officer (&quot;nai amphoe&quot;, นายอำเภอ), who is appointed by the Ministry of Interior. The officer is a subordinate of the provincial governor.

==Amphoe mueang==
The district which contains the administrative office of the province is the &quot;amphoe mueang&quot; (lit. &quot;town district&quot;). The district is not to be confused with the capital town itself, which is a different administrative entity usually much smaller than the district. Until the 1930s, most of the capital districts had names just like other districts, whereas districts dating back to old provinces had the word &quot;mueang&quot; in their name. In 1938 all the capital districts were renamed &quot;amphoe mueang&quot;, whereas in all non-capital districts &quot;mueang&quot; was removed from the name. The notable exception to this rule is Ayutthaya, where the capital district is named Amphoe Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (instead of &quot;Amphoe Mueang Ayutthaya&quot;), the same as the province, which is fully named &quot;Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya&quot;. Also the capital districts of Thonburi and Phra Nakhon Provinces had the same name as the province, which they kept when the two provinces were merged to form Bangkok metropolis.

In most cases the capital district is also the most populous district of the province, as the provincial administration is usually in the largest town of the province. Songkhla province is the most striking exception, as the town (and thus also the district) Hat Yai grew much faster than the capital Mueang Songkhla due to its better transport connections.

There are four districts in Thailand (Chan, Pan, Suang, and Yang) which contain the term &quot;mueang&quot; in their name as well, even though they are not capital districts. All of these were created relatively recently, between 1973 and 1995.

==King amphoe==
Minor districts (&quot;king amphoe&quot;, กิ่งอำเภอ — กิ่ง literally &#x27;branch&#x27;) are set up when the administration of areas remote from the district center is inconvenient for citizens. Most of the tasks of the &quot;amphoe&quot; are transferred to the &quot;king amphoe&quot;, but it is still partially a subordinate of the &quot;amphoe&quot; it was created from. When the &quot;king amphoe&quot; meets the necessary qualifications to become an &quot;amphoe&quot;, it is usually promoted. However, not every newly created &quot;amphoe&quot; begins as a &quot;king amphoe&quot;: if the qualifications are met directly, this phase is skipped. While usually a minor district is upgraded after a few years, in some cases it remains a minor district for decades. For example, Ko Yao was a minor district for 85 years until it was upgraded in 1988. Sometimes a district is downgraded to a minor district. Thung Wa lost a lot of its population to neighboring La-ngu minor district, so finally La-ngu was upgraded and Thung Wa downgraded. Another example is Chumphon Buri, which was reduced after the more developed part was split off to form a new district and the remaining district was downgraded.

The criteria required for an &quot;amphoe&quot; are a population of at least 30,000 people and at least five &quot;tambon&quot;, or, if the area is more than from the district office, a population of at least 15,000 and four &quot;tambon&quot;. 

A minor district is led by a chief officer (&quot;Hua Na King Amphoe&quot;, หัวหน้ากิ่งอำเภอ).

The Thai word &quot;king&quot; (กิ่ง) means &#x27;branch&#x27; and should not be confused with the English word &quot;king&quot;. The officially recommended translation is &quot;minor district&quot; —however they are also quite commonly translated as sub-district, which is the recommended translation for &quot;tambon&quot;, and also wrongly suggests that they are at a lower administrative level than the &quot;amphoe&quot;.

The Thai government upgraded all remaining 81 minor districts to full districts on 15 May 2007 in order to streamline administration. With publication in the &quot;Royal Gazette&quot; on 24 August the order became official.

==District office==

The administration of the district is housed in an office building called &quot;thi wa kan amphoe&quot; (ที่ว่าการอำเภอ), which also marks the center of each district. Distances on road signs are always calculated to this office building. The office is usually in the largest settlement of the district, to make it easily accessible to the majority of the population —one of the tasks of the amphoe is the civil registry, which makes the district the most important of the administrative levels for the Thai public.

<doc id="630635" wikidata="Q1055374" url="?curid=630635" title="Adenosine deaminase deficiency">
<text>Adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA deficiency) is a metabolic disorder that causes immunodeficiency. It is caused by mutations in the ADA gene. It accounts for about 10–20% of all cases of autosomal recessive forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) after excluding disorders related to inbreeding.

ADA deficiency can present in infancy, childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. Age of onset and severity is related to some 29 known genotypes associated with the disorder. It occurs in fewer than one in 100,000 live births worldwide.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptoms of ADA deficiency include pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, widespread skin rashes, jaundice (from hepatic infections), and candidiasis of the mouth and esophagus. Affected children also grow much more slowly than healthy children, commonly referred to as &quot;failure to thrive,&quot; which may lead to other developmental delays.

These symptoms are not due to the enzyme deficiency itself, but rather to the effects of frequent severe infections from viruses, bacteria, and certain fungi. Children are particularly vulnerable to repeated infections from the same organisms, as their lack of B-cells means they cannot produce IgG antibodies in significant amounts, which protect most people from pathogens that have infected them before. Most individuals with ADA deficiency are diagnosed with SCID in the first 6 months of life.

The large majority of cases of ADA deficiency are identified and diagnosed in children. However, a small minority have a less-severe form of the disease and remain undiagnosed until childhood, adolescence, or adulthood.

An association with polyarteritis nodosa has been reported.

==Genetics==
The enzyme adenosine deaminase is encoded by the ADA gene on chromosome 20. ADA deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 20 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

Age of onset and severity is related to some 29 known genotypes associated with the disorder.

==Pathophysiology==
ADA deficiency is due to a lack of the enzyme adenosine deaminase. This deficiency results in an accumulation of deoxyadenosine, which, in turn, leads to:
* A buildup of dATP in all cells, which inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and prevents DNA synthesis, so cells are unable to divide. Since developing T cells and B cells are some of the most mitotically active cells, they are highly susceptible to this condition.
* An increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine since the enzyme adenosine deaminase is important in the purine salvage pathway; both substances are toxic to immature lymphocytes, which thus fail to mature.
* Complete or near-complete absence of T-cells, B-cells, and NK cells.
Because T cells undergo proliferation and development in the thymus, affected individuals typically have a small, underdeveloped thymus. As a result, the immune system is severely compromised or completely lacking.

==Diagnosis== 
Diagnosis in developed nations is usually done through standardized newborn screening tests for a range of congenital diseases, including ADA deficiency. Most newborns with SCID, including those with ADA deficiency as an underlying cause, can be identified before the onset of major infections due to their decreased levels of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). TRECs are a normal product of T-cell development, and a deficit of them indicates a problem with lymphocyte maturation.

In the absence of newborn screening or to differentiate from other causes of SCID, some (but not all) children will display one or more of these features which are sometimes seen in ADA deficiency but not other forms of SCID:
* Earlier onset of failure to thrive
* Respiratory distress in an infant that is not caused by an infection
* Abnormal rib cage development
* Neurologic disorders, especially hearing loss

When ADA deficiency is suspected, the diagnosis may be confirmed through several lab tests of the patient&#x27;s red blood cells, or via genetic testing.

==Treatment==
Treatment of ADA deficiency focuses on reducing the frequency and severity of infections. Antibiotics are typically prescribed as a prophylactic measure to make the body more difficult for pathogenic organisms to colonize. Due to the frequency it is encountered and its indifference to most antibiotics, clinicians must be careful to include a medication that can prevent &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia.

In addition to antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is also provided when available. This treatment provides a layer of humoral immunity from healthy plasma donors.

Enzyme replacement therapy is provided to newborns until a definitive therapy plan can be implemented. There is some evidence that ERT also prevents tissue damage related to accumulated dATP and other molecules.

=== Stem cell transplantation ===
Long-term definitive treatment of ADA deficiency is typically achieved by transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from a matched family member donor, preferably a sibling. Before transplantation, testing must be done to ensure that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) properties of the donor and the transplant recipient align, to avoid transplant rejection.

=== Gene therapy ===
The other definitive therapy available for ADA deficiency is gene therapy. These therapies use a viral vector to integrate a working copy of the gene into the patient&#x27;s genome.

In September 1990, the first gene therapy to combat this disease was performed by Dr. William French Anderson on a four-year-old girl, Ashanti DeSilva, at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.
In April 2016 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency endorsed and recommended for approval a stem cell gene therapy called Strimvelis, for children with ADA-SCID for whom no matching bone marrow donor is available.

==History==
ADA deficiency was discovered in 1972 by Eloise Giblett, a professor at the University of Washington. The ADA gene was used as a marker for bone marrow transplants. A lack of ADA activity was discovered by Giblett in an immunocompromised transplant candidate. After discovering a second case of ADA deficiency in an immunocompromised patient, ADA deficiency was recognized as the first immunodeficiency disorder.

<doc id="630637" wikidata="Q4118656" url="?curid=630637" title="North Ronaldsay sheep">
<text>The North Ronaldsay or Orkney is a breed of sheep from North Ronaldsay, the northernmost island of Orkney, off the north coast of Scotland. It belongs to the Northern European short-tailed sheep group of breeds, and has evolved without much cross-breeding with modern breeds. It is a smaller sheep than most, with the rams (males) horned and ewes (females) mostly hornless. It was formerly kept primarily for wool, but now the two largest flocks are feral, one on North Ronaldsay and another on the Orkney island of Auskerry. The Rare Breeds Survival Trust lists the breed as a priority on its 2021–2022 watchlist, and they are in danger of extinction, with fewer than 600 registered breeding females in the United Kingdom.

The semi-feral flock on North Ronaldsay is the original flock that evolved to subsist almost entirely on seaweed – they are one of few mammals to do this. They are confined to the foreshore by a early 19th century drystane dyke, which completely encircles the island, forcing the sheep to evolve this unusual characteristic. The wall was built as kelping (the production of soda ash from seaweed) on the shore became uneconomical. Sheep were confined to the shore to protect the fields and crofts inside, and afterwards subsisted largely on seaweed.

This diet has caused a variety of adaptations in the sheep&#x27;s digestive system. These sheep have to extract the trace element copper far more efficiently than other breeds as their diet has a limited supply of copper. This results in them being susceptible to copper toxicity, if fed on a grass diet, as copper is toxic to sheep in high quantities. Grazing habits have also changed to suit the sheep&#x27;s environment. To reduce the chance of being stranded by an incoming tide, they graze at low tide and then ruminate at high tide.

A range of fleece colours are exhibited, including grey, brown and red. Meat from the North Ronaldsay has a distinctive flavour, described as &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;gamey&quot;, possibly in part due to the high iodine content in their diet of seaweed.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
The sheep are descended from the Northern European short-tailed sheep. Their arrival onto North Ronaldsay is not known precisely but it may have been as early as the Iron Age, or possibly even earlier, which would make them potentially the earliest ovines to arrive in Britain. Because of their isolated location, they have evolved without much admixture from imported Roman and European breeds. They share some characteristics, including their colour range and short tails, with Scandinavian sheep introduced when the islands were under Norse control, between the 9th and 15th centuries.

=== Enclosure ===
In 1832, a drystane dyke was erected on the island. Its construction was part of the response to the collapse of the kelping industry, which was the production of soda ash by the burning of seaweed. To provide a livelihood for those previously employed in kelping, the inland farmlands were reorganized, and the sheep kept away from the fields or crofts. Since then, the flocks on the island have been feral. The wall also unintentionally reduced the chances of crossbreeding, which would have diluted the gene pool of an already vulnerable breed. The wall circles the entire coast of the island, , and is high, making it one of the largest dry stone walls in the world. In 1999, Historic Scotland described it as a &quot;unique and important structure&quot; and designated it an &#x27;A&#x27;-list site requiring conservation. This status affords it special protection; any development has to be approved with conservation in mind.

Since the wall was erected, the human population of North Ronaldsay has fallen from 500 to around 50, and current residents lack the manpower to maintain the wall. Successive storms, the most damaging of which was in December 2012, have created large holes in the structure. The cost of repairs has been estimated at several million pounds. In 1902, it cost only 4 pence per hour to repair the wall, using stone taken from the shore. In 2015, Orkney Islands Council reported that some of the wall was in need of work, and that the rate of damage exceeded that of repair.

=== Punds ===

The punds, or pounds, also listed with Historic Scotland, are nine small enclosures situated across the island to contain the sheep for shearing, counting, lambing and slaughtering. The sheep are herded inside these punds twice a year, the only time they have access to grass feed. Between February and August, the sheep are brought into the punds, once for lambing and once for shearing. The lambs are born on the grass between February and May. At this time, the sheep are counted, lambs are given ear tags, and records are entered with the island&#x27;s sheep court to record ownership. Shearing takes place in July and August, and the whole island community is involved in herding and shearing the sheep. Slaughtering takes place only in winter when the meat is needed, and when the animals are fatter and yield more meat, since seaweed is more abundant in winter.

=== Sheep court ===
In 1839, just after the wall was erected, the North Ronaldsay Sheep Court was created. A group of eleven appointed islanders were responsible for the maintenance of the wall, the health of the sheep flock, and recording ownership of the sheep. Today, the Sheep Court remains the regulatory body responsible for organising ownership of the sheep.

=== Conservation ===
The North Ronaldsay Sheep Fellowship is one of several organisations concerned with the survival of the breed. They maintain the flock book, established in 1974, which is the breed registry containing all purebred animals. This book reports that there are fewer than 600 breeding females and roughly 3700 sheep in total. The Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) lists the North Ronaldsay as &quot;vulnerable&quot;.

Other island-based organisations include The North Ronaldsay Trust and the Orkney Sheep Foundation, who run an annual Sheep Festival (SheepFest) inviting volunteers to the island for a fortnight of sheepdyke rebuilding.

There are only two main populations of the breed. The primary one is on the island of North Ronaldsay itself; the other is on the island of Auskerry, which was established in 1983 by Teresa Probert and Simon Brogan.
Modern DNA analysis has shown little crossbreeding with other sheep breeds from mainland Britain. Testing carried out under the National Scrapie Plan looked for the ARQ allele, which protects against the scrapie disease and is present in modern selectively bred sheep, and found it in only 1.3 per cent of North Ronaldsay sheep.

Further DNA studies comparing the bones of the North Ronaldsay with remains of North European short-tailed sheep found on a Skara Brae site dating from around 3000 BCE have shown a very close match, suggesting that the North Ronaldsay has not genetically mixed with other breeds.

== Characteristics ==
=== Physical ===
North Ronaldsays are very small sheep, an adaptation to the harsh, cold environment. Rams typically weigh around , and ewes rarely exceed , both standing around high at the withers (shoulders). The sheep are slow-growing and a full-size carcass may weigh only .

The North Ronaldsay is a descendant of the primitive European short-tailed sheep breed. As the name of the descent parent would suggest, they have naturally short tails. Their bones are finer than other breeds and their head is dished (sloping inwards). Rams are all horned; these horns are typically ridged and spiraled. Only 20 per cent of the ewes are horned; the rest are polled (hornless).

=== Diet ===
North Ronaldsay sheep have a highly unusual diet consisting almost solely of seaweed. This has evolved due to their unique location, confined to the shoreline by a dry stone wall, leaving only seaweed for food. Apart from the marine iguana, native to the Galapagos Islands, it is the only land animal known to have such a diet. Studies have shown that, due to preference and availability, the sheep eat mainly kelps (&quot;Laminaria digitata&quot; and &quot;Laminaria hyperborea&quot;). This discovery led to suggestions that these kelps may be of use as an alternative food source for other livestock.

The grazing habits of the sheep have also adapted to their unusual diet: instead of grazing during the day and ruminating (digesting) at night as other sheep generally do, the North Ronaldsays graze as the tide uncovers the shore (twice in 24 hours), ruminating at high water. Feeding begins around 3.5 hours after high tide as the areas of kelp and seaweed are exposed. Four hours later, which is just after the low tide, feeding ends, allowing rumination to begin. This cycle reduces the chance of the sheep becoming stranded at sea by the incoming tide.

In spring, mother ewes are taken to grasslands without access to seaweed for lambing, and are only returned to the shore around August. The other sheep (males and non-pregnant females) remain on the shore, primarily consuming seaweed, throughout the year. Unusually for sheep, the North Ronaldsay fattens in winter when storms throw larger amounts of kelp and seaweed onto the shore and food is abundant.

The sheep&#x27;s source of fresh water is limited to the few freshwater lochs and ponds along the seashore. This has led them to become very salt tolerant, as their diet is salt-rich, and access to fresh water is limited. Compared with other breeds of sheep, they can far better handle elements present in the sea salt. These empirical conclusions were drawn in a 1997 study, but the underlying biological mechanism has yet to be understood.

==== Scientific analysis ====
The sheep have evolved a somewhat different physiology from other sheep, due to their unusual diet: their digestive system has adapted to extract the sugars in seaweeds more efficiently. A 2005 study at the University of Liverpool found that they have a greater susceptibility to copper toxicity, when compared with a more traditional breed such as the Cambridge. This is because seaweed has a chemical which inhibits the absorption of copper, so the sheep have to absorb copper more efficiently to obtain the required amount. The levels of copper found in typical sheep feed, including grass, are toxic for this breed. Studies at the Universities of Liverpool and Minnesota suggest that they can extract four times more copper from their diet than more traditional breeds.

Stable isotope ratio analysis of bone collagen and tooth enamel from seaweed-eating North Ronaldsay sheep have revealed elevated stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) compared to sheep feeding on C3-vegetation. This difference in stable carbon isotope ratios (arising from dietary differences), discovered by studying North Ronaldsay sheep, is made use of in archaeological studies, which have shown the existence of seaweed-eating sheep on Orkney around 5000 years ago.

== Use ==
=== Meat ===
When the United Kingdom was in the European Union, lamb and mutton from the sheep could be marketed as &quot;Orkney Lamb&quot;, which had Protected Designation of Origin status. The meat has a unique, rich flavour, which has been described as &quot;intense and almost gamey&quot;, and has a darker colour than most mutton, due in part to the animals&#x27; iodine-rich diet.

=== Wool ===

Despite their slight size, North Ronaldsay sheep were historically raised for their wool. It comes in a variety of colours and is very similar to the Shetland breed, due to their common ancestor. More common typical colours are the whites and greys, but browns, beiges, reds (also called tanay) and blacks, with coarser hair, are all exhibited. A full fleece weighs about .

The North Ronaldsay is a double-coated breed, meaning they have a wool undercoat and overcoat. The undercoat tends to be finer and soft, suitable for garments that would touch the skin, whereas the overcoat is coarser, with long hair that protects the sheep from the cold, wet weather of their natural environment. This fibre is more durable and tends to be used in overgarments.

His first novel, &quot;Gun, with Occasional Music&quot;, a genre work that mixed elements of science fiction and detective fiction, was published in 1994. In 1999, Lethem published &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, a National Book Critics Circle Award-winning novel that achieved mainstream success. In 2003, he published &quot;The Fortress of Solitude&quot;, which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. In 2005, he received a MacArthur Fellowship. Since 2011, he has taught creative writing at Pomona College.

==Early life==
Lethem was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Judith Frank Lethem, a political activist, and Richard Brown Lethem, an avant-garde painter. He was the eldest of three children. His father was Protestant (with Scottish and English ancestry) and his mother was Jewish, from a family with roots in Germany, Poland, and Russia. His brother Blake became an artist involved in the early New York hip hop scene, and his sister Mara became a photographer, writer, and translator. The family lived in a commune in Brooklyn, in the northern section of the neighborhood of Gowanus (now called Boerum Hill). Lethem&#x27;s fourth grade teacher at P.S. 29 in nearby Cobble Hill was future New York City Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña, whom he called the &quot;perfect&quot; teacher and to whom he dedicated his first novel, &quot;Gun, with Occasional Music&quot;. Despite the racial tensions and conflicts, he later described his bohemian childhood as &quot;thrilling&quot; and culturally wide-reaching. He gained an encyclopedic knowledge of the music of Bob Dylan, saw &quot;Star Wars&quot; 21 times during its original theatrical release, and read the complete works of the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick. Lethem later said Dick&#x27;s work was &quot;as formative an influence as marijuana or punk rock—as equally responsible for beautifully fucking up my life, for bending it irreversibly along a course I still travel.&quot;

His parents divorced when Lethem was young. When he was thirteen, his mother Judith died from a malignant brain tumor, an event which he has said haunted him and has strongly affected his writing. (Lethem discusses the direct relation between his mother and the Bob Dylan song &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; in the 2003 Canadian documentary &quot;Complete Unknown&quot;.) In 2007, Lethem explained, &quot;My books all have this giant, howling missing [center]—language has disappeared, or someone has vanished, or memory has gone.&quot;

Intending to become a visual artist like his father, Lethem attended the High School of Music &amp; Art in New York, where he painted in a style he describes as &quot;glib, show-offy, usually cartoonish&quot;. At Music &amp; Art, he produced his own zine, &quot;The Literary Exchange,&quot; which featured artwork and writing. He also created animated films and wrote a 125-page novel, &quot;Heroes&quot;, still unpublished.

After graduating from high school, Lethem entered Bennington College in Vermont in 1982 as a prospective art student. At Bennington, Lethem experienced an &quot;overwhelming. ... collision with the realities of class—my parents&#x27; bohemian milieu had kept me from understanding, even a little, that we were poor. ... at Bennington that was all demolished by an encounter with the fact of real privilege.&quot; This, coupled with the realization that he was more interested in writing than art, led Lethem to drop out halfway through his sophomore year. He hitchhiked from Denver, Colorado, to Berkeley, California, in 1984, across &quot;a thousand miles of desert and mountains through Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada, with about 40 dollars in my pocket&quot;, describing it as &quot;one of the stupidest and most memorable things I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

Lethem lived in California for twelve years, working as a clerk in used bookstores, including Moe&#x27;s and Pegasus &amp; Pendragon Books, and writing on his own time. Lethem published his first short story in 1989 and published several more in the early 1990s.

==Career==

===First novels===
Lethem&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Gun, with Occasional Music&quot;, is a merging of science fiction and the Chandleresque detective story, which includes talking kangaroos, radical futuristic versions of the drug scene, and cryogenic prisons. The novel was published in 1994 by Harcourt Brace, in what Lethem later described as a &quot;delirious&quot; experience. &quot;I&#x27;d pictured my first novels being published as paperback originals&quot;, he recalled, &quot;and instead a prestigious house was doing the book in cloth. ... I was in heaven.&quot; The novel was released to little initial fanfare, but an enthusiastic review in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, which declared &quot;Gun&quot; an &quot;audaciously assured first novel&quot;, catapulted the book to wider commercial success. &quot;Gun, with Occasional Music&quot; was a finalist for the 1994 Nebula Award, and placed first in the &quot;Best First Novel&quot; category of the 1995 &quot;Locus Magazine&quot; reader&#x27;s poll. In the mid-1990s, film producer-director Alan J. Pakula optioned the novel&#x27;s movie rights, which allowed Lethem to quit working in bookstores and devote his time to writing.

His next book was &quot;Amnesia Moon&quot; (1995). Partially inspired by Lethem&#x27;s experiences hitchhiking cross-country, this second novel uses a road narrative to explore a multi-post-apocalyptic future landscape rife with perception tricks. After publishing many of his early stories in a 1996 collection, &quot;The Wall of the Sky, the Wall of the Eye&quot;, Lethem published his third novel, &quot;As She Climbed Across the Table&quot; (1997). It starts with a physics researcher who falls in love with an artificially generated spatial anomaly called &quot;Lack&quot;, for whom she spurns her previous partner. Her ex-partner&#x27;s comic struggle with this rejection, and with the anomaly, constitute the majority of the narrative.

In 1996, Lethem moved from the San Francisco Bay Area back to Brooklyn. His next book, published after his return to Brooklyn, was &quot;Girl in Landscape&quot;. In the novel, a young girl must endure puberty while also having to face a strange and new world populated by aliens known as Archbuilders. Lethem has said that &quot;Girl in Landscape&quot;″s plot and characters, including the figures of a young girl and a violently protective father figure, were &quot;very strongly influenced&quot; by the 1956 John Wayne Western &quot;The Searchers&quot;, a movie with which he is &quot;obsessed&quot;.

===Mainstream success and &quot;genre bending&quot;===
The first novel Lethem began after returning to New York City was &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, a return to the detective theme. He maintained objective realism while exploring subjective alterity through Lionel Essrog. His protagonist has Tourette&#x27;s syndrome and is obsessed with language. Lethem later said that Essrog

... obviously [is] the character I&#x27;ve written with whom I most identify ... [the novel] stands outside myself ... It&#x27;s the only one which doesn&#x27;t need me, never did. It would have found someone to write it, by necessity.

Upon its publication in 1999, &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction, The Macallan Gold Dagger for crime fiction, and the Salon Book Award; it was named book of the year by &quot;Esquire&quot;. In 1999, actor Edward Norton announced that he was planning to write, direct and star in a film adaptation of the novel. Norton&#x27;s film was released in 2019.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the mainstream success of &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; made Lethem &quot;something of a hipster celebrity&quot;, and he was referred to several times as a &quot;genre bender&quot;. Critics cited the variety of Lethem&#x27;s novels, which were alternately hard-boiled detective fiction, science fiction, and autobiographical. Lethem credited his comfort in genre-mixing to his father&#x27;s art, which &quot;always combined observed and imagined reality on the same canvas, very naturally, very un-self-consciously.&quot; In &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Lev Grossman classed Lethem with a movement of authors similarly eager to blend literary and popular writing, including Michael Chabon (with whom Lethem is friends), Margaret Atwood, and Susanna Clarke.

In 2003, Lethem commented on the concept of &quot;genre bending&quot;:

The fact is, I used to get very involved, six or seven years ago, and before that, in questions of taxonomy of genre, and in the idea—which is ultimately a political idea—that a given writer, perhaps me, could in some objective way alter or reorganize the boundaries between genres. ... Nowadays, I&#x27;ve come to feel that talking about categories, about &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;, about genre and their boundaries and the blurring of those boundaries, all consists only of an elaborate way to avoid actually discussing what moves and interests me about books—my own, and others&#x27;. What I like are books in their homely actuality—the insides of the books, the mysterious movements of characters and situations and the emotions that accompany those movements. The play of sentences, their infinite variety.

In the early 2000s, Lethem published a story collection, edited two anthologies, wrote magazine pieces, and published the 55-page novella &quot;This Shape We&#x27;re In&quot; (2000). &quot;This Shape We&#x27;re In&quot; was one of the first offerings from McSweeney&#x27;s Books, the publishing imprint that developed from Dave Eggers&#x27; &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot;.

In November 2000, Lethem said that he was working on an uncharacteristically &quot;big sprawling&quot; novel, about a child who grows up to be a rock journalist. The novel was published in 2003 as &quot;The Fortress of Solitude&quot;. The semi-autobiographical &quot;bildungsroman&quot; features dozens of characters in a variety of milieus, but features a tale of racial tensions and boyhood in Brooklyn during the late 1970s. The main characters are two friends of different backgrounds who grew up on the same block in Boerum Hill. It was named one of nine &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; books of the year by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and has been published in fifteen languages.

Lethem&#x27;s second collection of short fiction, &quot;Men and Cartoons&quot;, was published in late 2004. In March 2005, &quot;The Disappointment Artist&quot;, his first collection of essays, was released. On September 20, 2005, Lethem received a MacArthur Fellowship.
In an interview with &quot;Armchair/Shotgun&quot; in 2009, Lethem said of short fiction:

I&#x27;m writing short stories right now, that&#x27;s what I do between novels, and I love them. I&#x27;m very devoted to it. You know, it&#x27;s funny. There seems to be some sort of law that you only get to be celebrated for one or the other. And then a couple of people will break it. Updike did. They didn&#x27;t review his story collections by saying, &quot;Well, these are nice, but he&#x27;s a novelist.&quot; Or review his novels by saying, &quot;Well, too bad he can&#x27;t do the longer stuff.&quot; Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I&#x27;ll take it. I have a very happy life as a novelist. But the story collections I&#x27;ve published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are among my proudest writings. They&#x27;re very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there&#x27;s no need to choose.

===2005–present===
In September 2006, Lethem wrote the article &quot;The Genius of Bob Dylan&quot;, a lengthy interview with Bob Dylan, which was published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The interview contained Lethem&#x27;s reflections on Dylan&#x27;s artistic achievements. It revealed Dylan&#x27;s dissatisfaction with contemporary recording techniques and his thoughts on his own status.

After &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;The Fortress of Solitude&quot;, Lethem decided that &quot;[i]t was time to leave Brooklyn in a literary sense anyway ... I really needed to defy all that stuff about place and memory.&quot; In 2007, he returned as a novelist to California, where some of his earlier fiction had been set, with &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Yet&quot;, a novel about an upstart rock band. The novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend&#x27;s complaint line and uses some of a caller&#x27;s words as lyrics. According to Lethem, the book was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California band in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called &quot;the unformed posturing phase of life&quot;. The novel takes its title from two (otherwise unconnected) songs of the same title by Roky Erickson and The Vulgar Boatmen. The original title was &quot;Monster Eyes&quot;, but Lethem was convinced to change it by his publisher. He later admitted to an interviewer that the association with the two songs &quot;made it feel very lucky to me to put it on the book,&quot; and that even though the new title &quot;isn’t my phrase, for a book about appropriated language and the way things can be repurposed, it seemed okay. And, it’s a beautifully passive-aggressive title.&quot; The novel received mixed reviews.

In 2005, Lethem had announced that he was planning to revive the Marvel Comics character Omega the Unknown in a ten-issue series to be published in 2006. After hearing of the project, Omega co-creator Steve Gerber expressed personal outrage over the use of the character without his participation, though he later discussed the project with Lethem and admitted that he had &quot;misjudged&quot; him. In May 2006, Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada explained that the series had been delayed to 2007, saying that &quot;winning the MacArthur Grant put additional and unexpected demands on [Lethem&#x27;s] time.&quot; The revamped &quot;Omega the Unknown&quot; series was published in ten monthly issues from October 2007 to July 2008; the issues were published in a single volume in October 2008.

In early 2007, Lethem began work on &quot;Chronic City&quot;, which was published on October 13, 2009. In July 2008, Lethem said that &quot;Chronic City&quot; is &quot;set on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, it&#x27;s strongly influenced by Saul Bellow, Philip K. Dick, Charles G. Finney and Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; and it concerns a circle of friends including a faded child-star actor, a cultural critic, a hack ghost-writer of autobiographies, and a city official. And it&#x27;s long and strange.&quot;

His essay, &quot;The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism&quot; (2007), is a passionate defense of plagiarism and a call for a return to a &quot;gift economy&quot; in the arts. He writes,

The kernel, the soul—let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterances—is plagiarism ... Don&#x27;t pirate my editions; do plunder my visions. The name of the game is Give All. You, reader, are welcome to my stories. They were never mine in the first place, but I gave them to you.

The essay was included in his 2011 collection, &quot;The Ecstasy of Influence: Nonfictions, Etc.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick&quot;, edited by Pamela Jackson and Lethem, was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Among other projects, Lethem published short books about John Carpenter&#x27;s film &quot;They Live&quot; (published in October, 2010 as &quot;They Live&quot;) and the Talking Heads album &quot;Fear of Music&quot;. Starting in 2011, he served as the Roy E. Disney Professor in Creative Writing at Pomona College, a position formerly held by the late David Foster Wallace.

Lethem&#x27;s ninth novel, entitled &quot;Dissident Gardens&quot;, was released on September 10, 2013. According to Lethem in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the novel concerns &quot;American leftists&quot;, very specifically &quot;a red-diaper baby generation trying to figure out what it all means, this legacy of American Communism.&quot; Regarding the novel&#x27;s setting, Lethem said in the same interview that it is

set in Queens and Greenwich Village, another New York neighborhood book, very much about the life of the city ... writing about Greenwich Village in 1958 was really a jump for me, it was as much of an imaginative leap as any of the more fantastical things I&#x27;ve done. But really exciting, too.

&quot;Dissident Gardens&quot; was quickly followed up in February 2015 with &quot;Lucky Alan and Other Stories&quot;, Lethem&#x27;s fifth short story collection.

Lethem&#x27;s tenth novel, &quot;A Gambler&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;The Blot&quot; in the United Kingdom), published in October 2016, concerns &quot;an international backgammon hustler who thinks he&#x27;s psychic&quot;. After changing publishers from Doubleday to Ecco, Lethem followed &quot;A Gambler&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;/&quot;The Blot&quot; with &quot;The Feral Detective&quot; in November 2018, Lethem&#x27;s first foray back into the detective novel genre since the acclaimed &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;.

Lethem&#x27;s twelfth novel, &quot;The Arrest&quot; - an &quot;utterly original postapocalyptic yarn about two siblings, the man that came between them, and a nuclear-powered super car,&quot; according to the publishers - was published in November 2020.

Lethem co-wrote six out of nine songs on the Lee Ranaldo album &quot;Electric Trim&quot;, released in 2017. He wrote the introduction to David Bowman&#x27;s 2019 novel, &quot;Big Bang&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1987, Lethem married the writer and artist Shelley Jackson; they were divorced by 1997. In 2000, he married Julia Rosenberg, a Canadian film executive; they divorced two years later. As of 2007, Lethem lived in Brooklyn and Berwick, Maine, with his third wife, the filmmaker Amy Barrett. He has two sons.

<text>Pizza Delight is a Canadian pizza restaurant franchise. It was founded in 1968 in Shediac, New Brunswick by Léandre Bourque and Allard Robichaud and then purchased by Bernard Imbeault and two of his friends a year later. The chain&#x27;s head offices are now located in Moncton. The restaurant primarily serves pizza, pasta and salad dishes. Today, it has over 70 restaurants, and operates in Ontario and the Atlantic provinces, with almost half of its locations in New Brunswick.

==Imvescor==
In 2000, Pizza Delight purchased Mikes, a prominent chain in Quebec and Ontario, for $15 million. Further acquisitions followed; the company acquired Scores in 2005, and Bâton Rouge in 2006. In 2006, it changed its name to Imvescor, to reflect its larger stable of restaurants. At its peak, the company owned and operated over 350 restaurants across Canada under four different banners. These included:

* 95 Pizza Delights
* 94 Mikes Restaurants
* 28 Bâton Rouge Restaurants
* 40 Scores Restaurants

In December 2017, MTY Food Group acquired Imvescor (including Pizza Delight) for $248 million.

<text>Amerind is a hypothetical higher-level language family proposed by Joseph Greenberg in 1960 and elaborated by his student Merritt Ruhlen. Greenberg proposed that all of the indigenous languages of the Americas belong to one of three language families, the previously established Eskimo–Aleut and Na–Dene, and with everything else—otherwise classified by specialists as belonging to dozens of independent families—as Amerind. Because of a large number of methodological disagreements with the 1987 book &quot;Language in the Americas&quot;, the relationships he proposed between these languages have been rejected by the majority of historical linguists as spurious.

The term &quot;Amerind&quot; is also occasionally used to refer broadly to the various indigenous languages of the Americas without necessarily implying that they are a genealogical group. To avoid ambiguity, the term Amerindian is often used for the latter meaning.

==Background==
The idea that all the languages of the Americas are related goes back to the 19th century when early linguists such as Peter Stephen DuPonceau and Wilhelm von Humboldt noticed that the languages of the Americas seemed to be very different from the better-known European languages, yet seemingly also quite similar to each other. When studies of American Indian languages began in earnest in the early 20th century linguists quickly realized that the indigenous languages were in fact not all that similar, but had a diversity much greater than among the languages of Europe. After a period of uncertainty about whether indigenous languages could be described and investigated by the methods applied to European languages, the first linguists began the daunting task of trying to classify the languages of the Americas by using the comparative method.

Among the most prolific and gifted linguists of his times was Edward Sapir, who was among the first to apply the comparative method to Native American languages. However, contrary to current practice in historical linguistics, Sapir also often relied on &quot;hunches&quot; and &quot;gut feeling&quot; when proposing new language families. Some of these suggestions have been proven correct while others have not. Sapir entertained the idea that ultimately all languages of the Americas might turn out to be provably related and such a phenomenon as the apparent Pan-American tendency to have first person forms with a prefixed n- was suggestive for this line of thought.

Since Sapir&#x27;s death in 1939, linguists have spent their time researching his proposals; typically, there have been two opposing camps in this endeavor: the so-called &quot;lumpers&quot; who usually look towards notions of genetic relationships, and the &quot;splitters&quot; who are widely critical of such proposals and expect successful family relations to be proven by the most rigorous standards of scholarship. Joseph Greenberg worked in the tradition of &quot;lumpers&quot; and following Sapir, was mindful of evidence not generally acceptable to those who hold that only actual linguistic reconstruction—through the comparative method—can yield reliable proof of genetic relationships between languages. In elaborating his classification of the Amerind languages, Greenberg relied heavily on Sapir&#x27;s early work on the North American languages and the highly impressionist classification of South American languages by Paul Rivet.

==Pronouns==
The main argument for the validity of Amerind is a pronominal pattern in many Native American languages that have first person forms with &quot;n&quot; and second person forms with &quot;m&quot;. 
This pattern was first noted by Alfredo Trombetti in 1905. Sapir suggested that it indicated that ultimately all Native American languages would turn out to be related. However, it is not universal, being confined primarily to western North America and to a lesser extent Mesoamerica; the incidence elsewhere is not statistically significant, and in western North American it is more an argument for the Hokan and Penutian phyla than for Amerind.

== Gender ==
Ruhlen reconstructed a morphological (ablaut) gender system for proto-Amerind, with masculine kinship terms containing the vowel *i and feminine the vowel *u, that he claims proves Greenberg&#x27;s reconstruction. This is based on Greenberg&#x27;s *t&#x27;a&#x27;na &quot;child&quot;, to which Ruhlen adds a masculine derivation *t&#x27;i&#x27;na &quot;son, boy&quot; and a feminine *t&#x27;u&#x27;na &quot;daughter, girl&quot;.

Unlike the n-/m- pattern in the pronouns, an intact i/u gender system is not attested across language families, and the consensus is that the pattern is a spurious one.

== Reception ==
The consensus among historical linguists specializing in Native American languages is that the Amerind hypothesis is unsupported by valid evidence, particularly because the basis for the proposal is mass comparison, but also because of many other methodological flaws made by Greenberg in the elaboration of the hypothesis. Critics regard this technique as fundamentally flawed, unable to distinguish chance resemblances from those due to a historical relationship among the languages and providing no means of distinguishing resemblances due to common descent from those due to language contact. In addition, critics have pointed out errors in the citation of data, including erroneous forms, erroneous glosses, unjustified morphological segmentation, attribution to the wrong language, and citation of entirely spurious forms.

A further criticism is that, contrary to normal scholarly practice, no source references are given for the data, which in most cases come from languages for which there is no standard, authoritative source. In addition, Greenberg does not normalize the spelling of the data, so it is impossible without knowing the source of each form to know what the notation represents.

While sympathetic to the idea of an Amerind language family, Morris Swadesh was critical of many of Greenberg&#x27;s subdivisions and believed it was due to an insufficient number of comparisons by Greenberg.

==Classification==
The 1960 proposal, in its outlines, was as follows:
* Amerind
** Almosan-Keresiouan

<doc id="630650" wikidata="Q278417" url="?curid=630650" title="Triquetral bone">
<text>The triquetral bone (; also called triquetrum, pyramidal, three-faced, and formerly cuneiform bone) is located in the wrist on the medial side of the proximal row of the carpus between the lunate and pisiform bones. It is on the ulnar side of the hand, but does not directly articulate with the ulna. Instead, it is connected to and articulates with the ulna through the Triangular fibrocartilage disc and ligament, which forms part of the ulnocarpal joint capsule. It connects with the pisiform, hamate, and lunate bones. It is the 2nd most commonly fractured carpal bone.

==Structure==
The triquetral is one of the eight carpal bones of the hand. It is a three-faced bone found within the proximal row of carpal bones. Situated beneath the pisiform, it is one of the carpal bones that form the carpal arch, within which lies the carpal tunnel. 
The triquetral bone may be distinguished by its pyramidal shape, and by an oval isolated facet for articulation with the pisiform bone. It is situated at the upper and ulnar side of the carpus. To facilitate its palpation in an exam, the hand must be radially deviated so that the triquetrium moves out from under the ulnar styloid process. The triquetrum may be difficult to find, since it also lies under the pisiform.

The triquetral bone has nutrient foramina for entering the nutrient vessels into the bone which comes from branches of the radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries.

==Ossification==
The triquetral bone ossifies between 9 months and 50 months (4 years and 2 months).

===Surfaces===
The &quot;superior surface&quot; presents a medial, rough, non-articular portion, and a lateral convex articular portion which articulates with the triangular articular disk of the wrist.

The &quot;inferior surface&quot;, directed lateralward, is concave, sinuously curved, and smooth for articulation with the hamate. The dorsal surface is rough for the attachment of ligaments.

The &quot;volar surface&quot; presents, on its medial part, an oval facet, for articulation with the pisiform; its lateral part is rough for ligamentous attachment.

The &quot;lateral surface&quot;, the base of the pyramid, is marked by a flat, quadrilateral facet, for articulation with the lunate.

The &quot;medial surface&quot;, the summit of the pyramid, is pointed and roughened, for the attachment of the ulnar collateral ligament of the wrist.

===In animals===
In reptiles and amphibians, the bone is instead referred to as the &quot;ulnare&quot;, since (at least in the most primitive fossils) it articulates with the ulna.

==Function==
The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. 

==Fracture==
Triquetral fractures can occur due to forceful flexion of the wrist, causing an avulsion of the dorsal aspect of the bone that is often hidden on anterior radiographs, but can be seen as a tiny bone fragment on lateral views.

==Etymology==
The etymology derives from the Latin &quot;triquetrus&quot; which means &quot;three-cornered.&quot; Therefore, it is sometimes also called the triangular bone or os triangulare. However, &quot;os triangulare&quot; may also refer to a nearby accessory bone.

<text>The University of Innsbruck (; ) is a public research university in Innsbruck, the capital of the Austrian federal state of Tyrol, founded on October 15, 1669.

It is the largest education facility in the Austrian Bundesland of Tirol, and the third largest in Austria behind the University of Vienna and the University of Graz. Significant contributions have been made in many branches, most of all in the physics department. Further, regarding the number of &quot;Web of Science&quot;-listed publications, it occupies the third rank worldwide in the area of mountain research. 

==History==
In 1562, a Jesuit grammar school was established in Innsbruck by Peter Canisius, today called &quot;Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck&quot;. It was financed by the salt mines in Hall in Tirol, and was re-chartered as a university on October 15, 1669, by Leopold I with four faculties. In 1782 this was reduced to a mere lyceum (as were all other universities in the Austrian Empire, apart from Prague, Vienna and Lviv), but it was reestablished as the University of Innsbruck in 1826 by Emperor Franz I. The university is therefore named after both of its founding fathers with the official title &quot;Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck&quot; (&quot;Universitas Leopoldino-Franciscea&quot;).

During the National Socialist era, the university was renamed the &quot;Deutsche Alpenuniversität&quot; in March 1941 at the suggestion of the then Rector Raimund von Klebelsberg. As at all universities, took place: opponents of the National Socialists were deprived of their powers and excluded from academic life. In 1945, after the end of World War II, it was reopened under the name &quot;University of Innsbruck&quot;.

The second half of the 20th century brought further expansion of the university: in 1969 the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture and in 1976 the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, which emerged from the Faculty of Law and Political Sciences. In 2004, the Faculty of Medicine was spun off, and in 2012 the School of Education was established, which was later renamed the Faculty of Teacher Education.

In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004 crashed in Thailand, killing all aboard, including 21 members of the University of Innsbruck. The passengers included professor and economist Clemens August Andreae, another professor, six assistants, and 13 students. Andreae had often led field visits to Hong Kong.

In 2005, copies of letters written by the emperors Frederick II and Conrad IV were found in the university&#x27;s library. They arrived in Innsbruck in the 18th century, having left the charterhouse Allerengelberg in Schnals due to its abolition.

===Ceremonial equipment=== 

In the 1850s, the Habsburgs gradually closed the University of Olomouc as a consequence of the Olomouc students&#x27; and professors&#x27; participation in the 1848 revolutions and the Czech National Revival. The ceremonial equipment of the University of Olomouc was then transferred to the University of Innsbruck. The original Olomouc ceremonial maces from the 1580s are now used as the maces of Innsbruck University and Innsbruck Medical University. Olomouc University Rector&#x27;s mace from ca. 1572 is nowadays used as the mace of the Innsbruck Faculty of Theology and Olomouc Faculty of Law Dean&#x27;s Mace from 1833 is nowadays used as Innsbruck&#x27;s Faculty of Law Mace.

Since the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the Czechs have been unsuccessfully requesting the return of the University of Olomouc&#x27;s original ceremonial equipment. Many years later, in 1998, Innsbruck donated an exact copy of the rector&#x27;s mace to Palacký University, but it is still, in 2015, using the Olomouc University original maces and other regalia as its own ceremonial equipment.

== Academics ==

Around 28,000 people study at the University of Innsbruck, making it one of the largest universities in Austria alongside the University of Vienna and the University of Graz. Every year, more than 4,000 students start a new degree program. Approximately the same number complete their studies at the university each year. Around 4000 courses are offered in the various subjects each academic year.

=== Programs ===
The university sees itself as a comprehensive university and covers a wide range of subjects with about 150 programs in 16 faculties: from architecture to zoology.

The university offers 41 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs including teacher training programs, 60 master&#x27;s degree programs, 4 diploma programs and 26 PhD/doctoral degree programs (as of the academic year 2022/23) in the fields of architecture, humanities, natural sciences, law, social sciences and economics, as well as theology and technical sciences.

For the bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in architecture, biology, computer science, pharmacy, psychology, economics, the teacher training programs, the diploma program in international economics, and the master&#x27;s degree programs in psychology, pharmaceutical sciences, and peace and conflict studies, special admission regulations apply prior to general admission. However, admission procedures are currently suspended for a majority of these studies.

Many studies can be supplemented with freely selectable packages on a wide variety of specializations such as digitalization, sustainability, media or corporate communications. A two-semester extension study program can be used to expand subject-specific competencies thematically. Currently, the university offers extension studies in entrepreneurship, computer science and scientific computing.

The Digital Science Center (DiSC), founded in 2019, teaches students digital skills. These range from programming languages to skills in data management and analysis to non-technical aspects of digitization.

After the separation of the Faculty of Medicine in 2004, medical studies are offered at the Medical University of Innsbruck.

In October 2021, a controversy arose about a &quot;Peace Studies&quot; course. As a result, the university management declared that, despite the name Master&#x27;s program, it was not a regular master program, but an extraordinary course on peace, development, security and international conflict transformation.

Since 2022, a regular master&#x27;s program in &quot;Peace and Conflict studies&quot; is taught at the university. In 2023, Rina Alluri was inaugurated as the new UNESCO Chair of Peace Studies.

=== Student representation ===
The Austrian Students&#x27; Association (ÖH) is the legal representation of all students in Austria. All students are automatically members of the ÖH and pay a fee of 21,20 Euro (incl. 0,70 Euro for insurance) per semester (WS2022/2023), which is collected together with the tuition fee by the study department of the university.

=== Tuition fee ===
Regular students with EU/EEA/CH citizenship and students of equal status who are admitted to a bachelor&#x27;s, diploma, master&#x27;s or doctoral program pay only the ÖH fee at the beginning of their new studies. After exceeding the non-contributory period of study, a tuition fee of 363.36 euros (A, EU/EEA, CH) or for third-country nationals 726.72 euros per semester is charged.

==The faculties==
The new plan of organisation (having become effective on October 1, 2004) installed the following 16 faculties to replace the previously existing six faculties:
*Faculty of Architecture,
*Faculty of Biology,
*Faculty of Catholic Theology,
*Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy,
*Faculty of Economics and Statistics,
*Faculty of Education,
*Faculty of Technical Sciences (formerly Faculty of Engineering Science and before that Faculty of Civil Engineering),
*Faculty of Geography and Atmospheric Sciences,
*Faculty of Humanities 1 (Philosophy and History),
*Faculty of Humanities 2 (Language and Literature),
*Faculty of Law,
*Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics,
*Faculty of Psychology and Sports science,
*School of Political Sciences and Sociology,
*School of Management,
*School of Education (teacher training).

As of 1 January 2004, the Faculty of Medicine was sectioned off from the main university to become a university in its own right. This is now called the Innsbruck Medical University (Medizinische Universität Innsbruck).

The inter-disciplinary unit called the Digital Science Center (DiSC) was founded in 2019 to integrate and promote digitalisation of scientific research as well as to support high-quality science.

==Buildings==
The university buildings are spread across the city and there is no university campus as such. The most important locations are:

*Theology faculty was opened 1562 as a Jesuit School in 1766 and the university used buildings from the Jesuit church in &quot;the Leopoldsaal&quot; (the original university).
*In 1924, main building and the university library opened.
*1969 the scientific faculty and the construction faculty in Hotting west was opened.
*1976 construction began on &quot;Geiwi tower&quot; for the former Philosophy faculty, an addition to the main building.
*1997 The Social Science faculty (built in the former Fenner barracks) was opened.
*2012 Center of Chemistry and Biomedicine was opened.
*2023 Ágnes-Heller-House was opened.
*Several university clinics of the medical university in the area became &quot;Tyrolian national hospitals&quot;.

<text>The Medical University of Innsbruck () is a university in Innsbruck, Austria. It used to be one of the four historical faculties of the Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck and became an independent university in 2004.

== History ==
The medical tradition dates back long before the foundation of the university, with the foundation of the first hospital in the nearby silver-mining city Schwaz in 1307. A medical faculty was included in the initial university, established in 1669 by emperor Leopold I.

== Ceremonial equipment ==
In the 1850s the Habsburgs gradually closed the University of Olomouc as a consequence of the Olomouc students&#x27; and professors&#x27; participation on the 1848 revolutions and the Czech National Revival. The ceremonial equipment of the University of Olomouc was then transferred to the University of Innsbruck. The original Olomouc ceremonial maces from the 1580s are now used as maces of the University of Innsbruck, its faculties and of the Medical University of Innsbruck. The Medical University uses the ceremonial mace of Olomouc Faculty of Philosophy from 1588 and Olomouc Rector&#x27;s Chain made sometime between 1566 and 1573.

The ceremonial mace currently used by the Medical University of Innsbruck was given by Olomouc bishop Stanislav Pavlovský to the University of Olomouc in ca. 1588. It is 163 centimeters high, it is made of silver and has gold plating. It bears inscription S. P. E. O. (Stanislaus Pawlowski Episcopus Olomucii) and other ornaments.

Within the framework of the University Act of 2002, the medical faculty was separated from the Leopold-Franzens University, and the Medical University of Innsbruck was established as a university in its own right. Today, the Med-Uni has some 3,000 students and 1,800 employees. It is the most important medical research and training facility in western Austria and the home university of many Tyroleans, South Tyroleans and students from the Province of Vorarlberg.

== Nobel Prize laureates ==
* Fritz Pregl, 1923 (chemistry - for his contributions to quantitative organic microanalysis)
* Adolf Windhaus, 1928 (chemistry - for his work on sterols and their relation to vitamins)
* Hans Fischer, 1930 (chemistry - for the synthesis of haemin)

<text>Île d&#x27;Yeu () or L&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Yeu, is an island and commune just off the Vendée coast of western France. The island&#x27;s two harbors, Port-Joinville in the north and Port de la Meule to the south, in a rocky inlet of the southern granite coast, are famous for tuna and lobster fishing, respectively.

Administratively, the commune of L&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Yeu is part of the Vendée department and the Pays de la Loire region of France.

==History==


Neolithic markings in the native stone and an unusual concentration of megalithic dolmens and menhirs attest to the island&#x27;s early sanctity.

Irish monks from Bangor, County Down, dedicated their monastery on the Île d&#x27;Yeu to Hilaire; Saint Amand from Poitou received early training there, but it was destroyed by Viking raiders in the ninth century. During the tenth century, monks from Marmoutier near Tours and monks of Saint-Cyprien at Poitiers built a new monastery and dedicated it to Saint Stephen.

A wooden stockade was built by the lords of Belleville to protect their maritime commerce in the area from pirates but this was eventually demolished and a stone castle built by Jeanne de Belleville and improved by her husband Olivier IV de Clisson. The castle built on an islet linked to the coast by a bridge is first mentioned in 1356.

Since the nineteenth century Île d&#x27;Yeu has attracted many artists. Jean Rigaud (1912–1999), official painter to the French Navy, had a house there, as did Maurice Boitel (1919–2007). Jean Dufy (1888–1964) made about twenty paintings of l&#x27;Ile d&#x27;Yeu during several summer stays between 1926 and 1930.

Philippe Pétain, the proclaimed hero of Verdun during World War I who later became the leader of France&#x27;s wartime collaborationist Vichy régime, was sentenced to life imprisonment for treason on Île d&#x27;Yeu. He died in a private home in Port-Joinville in 1951, and is buried in the local cemetery (Cimetière communal de Port-Joinville).

The poet Marc-Adolphe Guégan, an early French exponent of haiku, lived on the island until his death in 1959.

The island&#x27;s seaweeds have been the subject of studies by the French marine biologist Françoise Ardré.

The children&#x27;s author Ludwig Bemelmans, who summered on the island, took inspiration from a hospital stay after a bicycle crash for his first &quot;Madeline&quot; book, published in 1939.

A two year pilot program, called Harmon&#x27;Yeu, was initiated in the spring of 2020 to interconnect 23 houses in the Ker Pissot neighborhood and surrounding areas with a microgrid that was automated as a smart grid with software from Engie. Sixty-four solar panels with a peak capacity of 23.7 kW were installed on five houses and a battery with a storage capacity of 15 kWh was installed on one house. Six houses store excess solar energy in their hot water heaters. A dynamic system apportions the energy provided by the solar panels and stored in the battery and hot water heaters to the system of 23 houses. The smart grid software dynamically updates energy supply and demand in five minute intervals, deciding whether to pull energy from the battery or from the panels and when to store it in the hot water heaters. This pilot program was the first such project in France.

==Population==
== Transport==
The island is reached by ferry from Fromentine or Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie. Air transportation is available at Île d&#x27;Yeu Aerodrome , with commercial service from Nantes Airport.

==Climate==
Île d&#x27;Yeu has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with mild weather year-round and significantly more precipitation in winter than in summer.

<doc id="630666" wikidata="Q15262558" url="?curid=630666" title="Northavon">
<text>Northavon was a district in the English county of Avon from 1974 to 1996.

The district was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974 as part of a reform of local authorities throughout England and Wales. Under the reorganisation, the area surrounding the cities of Bath and Bristol was formed into a new county of &quot;Avon&quot;, named after the river that ran through the area. The county was divided into six districts, one of which was formed from the areas of Sodbury Rural District (except the parish of Alderley) and most of Thornbury Rural District (16 out of 21 parishes) in Gloucestershire. The district was given the name &quot;Northavon&quot; in 1973, denoting the district&#x27;s position in the county.

In 1991 the county boundaries of Avon and Gloucestershire were realigned. The main effect of the change was that the Hillesley and Tresham area was transferred from Northavon to the neighbouring District of Stroud in Gloucestershire.

Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England, both the County of Avon and District of Northavon were abolished on 1 April 1996. Northavon was merged with the neighbouring Borough of Kingswood to form the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire.

Northavon was a parliamentary constituency. It was abolished ahead of the 2010 general election, with the area being split between the constituencies of Filton and Bradley Stoke and Thornbury and Yate.

==Premises==
In 1986 Northavon District Council built a civic centre on Castle Street in Thornbury, at the corner with Stokefield Close. The building remained the council&#x27;s meeting place and main offices until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996. The building was subsequently used by South Gloucestershire Council until 2013. It has since been demolished and Alexandra Lodge, a development of retirement homes, has been built on the site.

<text>An anaesthetic machine (British English) or anesthesia machine (American English) is a medical device used to generate and mix a fresh gas flow of medical gases and inhalational anaesthetic agents for the purpose of inducing and maintaining anaesthesia.

The machine is commonly used together with a mechanical ventilator, breathing system, suction equipment, and patient monitoring devices; strictly speaking, the term &quot;anaesthetic machine&quot; refers only to the component which generates the gas flow, but modern machines usually integrate all these devices into one combined freestanding unit, which is colloquially referred to as the &quot;anaesthetic machine&quot; for the sake of simplicity. In the developed world, the most frequent type in use is the continuous-flow anaesthetic machine or &quot;Boyle&#x27;s machine&quot;, which is designed to provide an accurate supply of medical gases mixed with an accurate concentration of anaesthetic vapour, and to deliver this continuously to the patient at a safe pressure and flow. This is distinct from intermittent-flow anaesthetic machines, which provide gas flow only on demand when triggered by the patient&#x27;s own inspiration.

Simpler anaesthetic apparatus may be used in special circumstances, such as the triservice anaesthetic apparatus, a simplified anaesthesia delivery system invented for the British Defence Medical Services, which is light and portable and may be used for ventilation even when no medical gases are available. This device has unidirectional valves which suck in ambient air, which can be enriched with oxygen from a cylinder, with the help of a set of bellows.

==History==

The original concept of continuous-flow machines was popularised by Boyle&#x27;s anaesthetic machine, invented by the British anaesthetist Henry Boyle at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London, United Kingdom, in 1917, although similar machines had been in use in France and the United States. Prior to this time, anaesthesiologists often carried all their equipment with them, but the development of heavy, bulky cylinder storage and increasingly elaborate airway equipment meant that this was no longer practical for most circumstances. Contemporary anaesthetic machines are sometimes still referred to metonymously as &quot;Boyle&#x27;s machine&quot;, and are usually mounted on anti-static wheels for convenient transportation.
Many of the early innovations in anaesthetic equipment in the United States, including the closed circuit carbon-dioxide absorber (a.k.a. the Guedel-Foregger Midget) and diffusion of such equipment to anaesthesiologists within the United States can be attributed to Richard von Foregger and The Foregger Company.

==Flow rate==
In anaesthesia, fresh gas flow is the mixture of medical gases and volatile anaesthetic agents which is produced by an anaesthetic machine and has not been recirculated. The flow rate and composition of the fresh gas flow is determined by the anaesthetist. Typically the fresh gas flow emerges from the common gas outlet, a specific outlet on the anaesthetic machine to which the breathing attachment is connected.

Open circuit forms of equipment, such as the Magill attachment, require high fresh gas flows (e.g. 7 litres/min) to prevent the patient from rebreathing their own expired carbon dioxide. Recirculating (rebreather) systems, use soda lime to absorb carbon dioxide, in the scrubber, so that expired gas becomes suitable to re-use. With a very efficient recirculation system, the fresh gas flow may be reduced to the patient&#x27;s minimum oxygen requirements (e.g. 250ml/min), plus a little volatile as needed to maintain the concentration of anaesthetic agent.

Increasing fresh gas flow to a recirculating breathing system can reduce carbon dioxide absorbent consumption. There is a cost/benefit trade-off between gas flow and use of adsorbent material when no inhalational anaesthetic agent is used which may have economic and environmental consequences.

*High flow anesthesia supplies fresh gas flow which approximates the patient’s minute ventilation, which is usually about 3 to 6 litres per minute in a normal adult.
*Low flow anesthesia supplies fresh gas flow of less than half the patient&#x27;s minute ventilation of the patient, which is usually less than 3.0 litres per minute in a normal adult.
*Minimal flow anesthesia supplies fresh gas flow of about 0.5 litres per minute.
*Closed system anesthesia supplies fresh gas flow as needed to make up the recirculated gas volume to compensate for the patient’s need for oxygen and anesthetic agents.

==Anaesthetic vapouriser==

An anesthetic vaporizer (American English) or anaesthetic vapouriser (British English) is a device generally attached to an anesthetic machine which delivers a given concentration of a volatile anesthetic agent. It works by controlling the vaporization of anesthetic agents from liquid, and then accurately controlling the concentration in which these are added to the fresh gas flow. The design of these devices takes account of varying: ambient temperature, fresh gas flow, and agent vapor pressure. There are generally two types of vaporizers: plenum and drawover. Both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. The &quot;dual-circuit gas-vapor blender&quot; is a third type of vaporizer used exclusively for the agent desflurane.

===Plenum vaporizers===
The plenum vaporizer is driven by positive pressure from the anesthetic machine, and is usually mounted on the machine. The performance of the vaporizer does not change regardless of whether the patient is breathing spontaneously or is mechanically ventilated. The internal resistance of the vaporizer is usually high, but because the supply pressure is constant the vaporizer can be accurately calibrated to deliver a precise concentration of volatile anesthetic vapor over a wide range of fresh gas flows. The plenum vaporizer is an elegant device which works reliably, without external power, for many hundreds of hours of continuous use, and requires very little maintenance.

The plenum vaporizer works by accurately splitting the incoming gas into two streams. One of these streams passes straight through the vaporizer in the bypass channel. The other is diverted into the vaporizing chamber. Gas in the vaporizing chamber becomes fully saturated with volatile anesthetic vapor. This gas is then mixed with the gas in the bypass channel before leaving the vaporizer.

A typical volatile agent, isoflurane, has a saturated vapor pressure of 32kPa (about 1/3 of an atmosphere). This means that the gas mixture leaving the vaporizing chamber has a partial pressure of isoflurane of 32kPa. At sea-level (atmospheric pressure is about 101kPa), this equates conveniently to a concentration of 32%. However, the output of the vaporizer is typically set at 1–2%, which means that only a very small proportion of the fresh gas needs to be diverted through the vaporizing chamber (this proportion is known as the splitting ratio). It can also be seen that a plenum vaporizer can only work one way round: if it is connected in reverse, much larger volumes of gas enter the vaporizing chamber, and therefore potentially toxic or lethal concentrations of vapor may be delivered. (Technically, although the dial of the vaporizer is calibrated in volume percent (e.g. 2%), what it actually delivers is a partial pressure of anesthetic agent (e.g. 2kPa)).

The performance of the plenum vaporizer depends extensively on the saturated vapor pressure of the volatile agent. This is unique to each agent, so it follows that each agent must only be used in its own specific vaporizer. Several safety systems, such as the Fraser-Sweatman system, have been devised so that filling a plenum vaporizer with the wrong agent is extremely difficult. A mixture of two agents in a vaporizer could result in unpredictable performance from the vaporizer.

Saturated vapor pressure for any one agent varies with temperature, and plenum vaporizers are designed to operate within a specific temperature range. They have several features designed to compensate for temperature changes (especially cooling by evaporation). They often have a metal jacket weighing about 5 kg, which equilibrates with the temperature in the room and provides a source of heat. In addition, the entrance to the vaporizing chamber is controlled by a bimetallic strip, which admits more gas to the chamber as it cools, to compensate for the loss of efficiency of evaporation.

The first temperature-compensated plenum vaporizer was the Cyprane &#x27;FluoTEC&#x27; Halothane vaporizer, released onto the market shortly after Halothane was introduced into clinical practice in 1956.

===Drawover vaporizers===
The drawover vaporizer is driven by negative pressure developed by the patient, and must therefore have a low resistance to gas flow. Its performance depends on the minute volume of the patient: its output drops with increasing minute ventilation.

The design of the drawover vaporizer is much simpler: in general it is a simple glass reservoir mounted in the breathing attachment. Drawover vaporizers may be used with any liquid volatile agent (including older agents such as diethyl ether or chloroform, although it would be dangerous to use desflurane). Because the performance of the vaporizer is so variable, accurate calibration is impossible. However, many designs have a lever which adjusts the amount of fresh gas which enters the vaporizing chamber.

The drawover vaporizer may be mounted either way round, and may be used in circuits where re-breathing takes place, or inside the circle breathing attachment.

Drawover vaporizers typically have no temperature compensating features. With prolonged use, the liquid agent may cool to the point where condensation and even frost may form on the outside of the reservoir. This cooling impairs the efficiency of the vaporizer. One way of minimising this effect is to place the vaporizer in a bowl of water.

The relative inefficiency of the drawover vaporizer contributes to its safety. A more efficient design would produce too much anesthetic vapor. The output concentration from a drawover vaporizer may greatly exceed that produced by a plenum vaporizer, especially at low flows. For safest use, the concentration of anesthetic vapor in the breathing attachment should be continuously monitored.

Despite its drawbacks, the drawover vaporizer is cheap to manufacture and easy to use. In addition, its portable design means that it can be used in the field or in veterinary anesthesia.

===Dual-circuit gas–vapor blender===
The third category of vaporizer (the dual-circuit gas–vapor blender) was created specifically for the agent desflurane. Desflurane boils at 23.5 °C, which is very close to room temperature. This means that at normal operating temperatures, the saturated vapor pressure of desflurane changes greatly with only small fluctuations in temperature. This means that the features of a normal plenum vaporizer are not sufficient to ensure an accurate concentration of desflurane. Additionally, on a very warm day, all the desflurane would boil, and very high (potentially lethal) concentrations of desflurane might reach the patient.

A desflurane vaporizer (e.g. the TEC 6 produced by Datex-Ohmeda) is heated to 39C and pressurized to 194kPa. It is mounted on the anesthetic machine in the same way as a plenum vaporizer, but its function is quite different. It evaporates a chamber containing desflurane using heat, and injects small amounts of pure desflurane vapor into the fresh gas flow. A transducer senses the fresh gas flow.

A warm-up period is required after switching on. The desflurane vaporizer will fail if mains power is lost. Alarms sound if the vaporizer is nearly empty. An electronic display indicates the level of desflurane in the vaporizer.

The expense and complexity of the desflurane vaporizer have contributed to the relative lack of popularity of desflurane, although in recent years it is gaining in popularity.

=== Historical vaporizers ===
Historically, ether (the first volatile agent) was first used by John Snow&#x27;s inhaler (1847) but was superseded by the use of chloroform (1848). Ether then slowly made a revival (1862–1872) with regular use via Curt Schimmelbusch&#x27;s &quot;mask&quot;, a narcosis mask for dripping liquid ether. Now obsolete, it was a mask constructed of wire, and covered with cloth.

Pressure and demand from dental surgeons for a more reliable method of administering ether helped modernize its delivery. In 1877, Clover invented an ether inhaler with a water jacket, and by the late 1899 alternatives to ether came to the fore, mainly due to the introduction of spinal anesthesia. Subsequently, this resulted in the decline of ether (1930–1956) use due to the introduction of cyclopropane, trichloroethylene, and halothane. By the 1980s, the anesthetic vaporizer had evolved considerably; subsequent modifications lead to a raft of additional safety features such as temperature compensation, a bimetallic strip, temperature-adjusted splitting ratio and anti-spill measures.

==Components of a typical machine==

The &quot;breathing circuit&quot; is the ducting through which the breathing gases flow from the machine to the patient and back, and includes components for mixing, adjusting, and monitoring the composition of the breathing gas, and for removing carbon dioxide.

A modern anaesthetic machine includes at minimum the following components:
* Connections to piped oxygen, medical air, and nitrous oxide from a wall supply in the healthcare facility, or reserve gas cylinders of oxygen, air, and nitrous oxide attached via a pin index safety system yoke with a Bodok seal
* Pressure gauges, regulators and &#x27;pop-off&#x27; valves, to monitor gas pressure throughout the system and protect the machine components and patient from excessive rises. An adjustable pressure-limiting valve (commonly abbreviated to APL valve, and also referred to as an expiratory valve, relief valve or spill valve) is part of the Breathing circuit which allows excess gas to leave the system while preventing ambient air from entering.
* Flowmeters such as rotameters for oxygen, air, and nitrous oxide
* Vaporisers to provide accurate dosage control when using volatile anaesthetics
* A high-flow oxygen flush, which bypasses the flowmeters and vaporisers to provide pure oxygen at 30-75 litres/minute
* Systems for monitoring the gases being administered to, and exhaled by, the patient, including an oxygen failure warning device
Systems for monitoring the patient&#x27;s heart rate, ECG, blood pressure and oxygen saturation may be incorporated, in some cases with additional options for monitoring end-tidal carbon dioxide and temperature. Breathing systems are also typically incorporated, including a manual reservoir bag for ventilation in combination with an adjustable pressure-limiting valve, as well as an integrated mechanical ventilator, to accurately ventilate the patient during anaesthesia.

==Safety features of modern machines==
Based on experience gained from analysis of mishaps, the modern anaesthetic machine incorporates several safety devices, including:
* an oxygen failure alarm (a.k.a. &#x27;Oxygen Failure Warning Device&#x27; or OFWD). In older machines this was a pneumatic device called a Ritchie whistle which sounds when oxygen pressure is 38 psi descending. Newer machines have an electronic sensor.
* Nitrous cut-off or oxygen failure protection device, OFPD: the flow of medical nitrous-oxide is dependent on oxygen pressure. This is done at the regulator level. In essence, the nitrous-oxide regulator is a &#x27;slave&#x27; of the oxygen regulator. i.e., if oxygen pressure is lost then the other gases can not flow past their regulator.
* hypoxic-mixture alarms (hypoxy guards or ratio controllers) to prevent gas mixtures which contain less than 21–25% oxygen being delivered to the patient. In modern machines it is impossible to deliver 100% nitrous oxide (or any hypoxic mixture) to the patient to breathe. Oxygen is automatically added to the fresh gas flow even if the anaesthesiologist should attempt to deliver 100% nitrous oxide. Ratio controllers usually operate on the pneumatic principle or are chain linked (link 25 system). Both are located on the rotameter assembly, unless electronically controlled.
* ventilator alarms, which warn of low or high airway pressures.
* interlocks between the vaporizers preventing inadvertent administration of more than one volatile agent concurrently
* alarms on all the above physiological monitors
* the Pin Index Safety System prevents cylinders being accidentally connected to the wrong yoke
* the NIST (Non-Interchangeable Screw Thread) or Diameter Index Safety System, DISS system for pipeline gases, which prevents piped gases from the wall being accidentally connected to the wrong inlet on the machine
* pipeline gas hoses have non-interchangeable Schrader valve connectors, which prevents hoses being accidentally plugged into the wrong wall socket

The functions of the machine should be checked at the beginning of every operating list in a &quot;cockpit-drill&quot;. Machines and associated equipment must be maintained and serviced regularly.

Older machines may lack some of the safety features and refinements present on newer machines. However, they were designed to be operated without mains electricity, using compressed gas power for the ventilator and suction apparatus. Modern machines often have battery backup, but may fail when this becomes depleted.

The modern anaesthetic machine still retains all the key working principles of the Boyle&#x27;s machine (a British Oxygen Company trade name) in honour of the British anaesthetist Henry Boyle. In India, however, the trade name &#x27;Boyle&#x27; is registered with Boyle HealthCare Pvt. Ltd., Indore MP.

Various regulatory and professional bodies have formulated checklists for different countries. Machines should be cleaned between cases as they are at considerable risk of contamination with pathogens.

<text>John W. Brown (1867 – June 19, 1941) was a labor union leader.

Born in Canada, he moved to Maine and worked as a joiner at the Bath Iron Works, where he became involved with the labor movement. He became an organizer for the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, then went to the United Mine Workers and was involved with the Colorado conflicts of 1913 and 1914, including the Ludlow Massacre.

In 1934 he was living in Woolwich, Maine, where he helped organize Local 4 of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America, and later served on the union&#x27;s board. From 1936 on he wrote a regular column for the &quot;Shipyard Worker&quot;, the union&#x27;s newspaper.

He died at home, from an accidental discharge of his hunting rifle. Liberty ship SS &quot;John W. Brown&quot; was named after him the following year; the ship has been preserved as a museum.

<text>South Herefordshire was one of nine local government districts of the English county of Hereford and Worcester from 1974 to 1998.

==History==
South Herefordshire District was formed on 1 April 1974 as part of a general reorganisation of local administration in England and Wales under the Local Government Act 1972. It was formed from part of the administrative county of Herefordshire, and covered the area of four former districts, which were abolished at the same time:
*Dore and Bredwardine Rural District
*Ross-on-Wye Urban District
*Hereford Rural District
*Ross and Whitchurch Rural District.
The district entirely surrounded the district of Hereford.

Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England, South Herefordshire and the county of Hereford and Worcester were abolished in 1998. South Herefordshire was combined with the areas of City of Hereford, most of the District of Leominster, and part of the District of Malvern Hills to form a new unitary authority of Herefordshire.

==Parishes==
The district comprised the following civil parishes:.
*Abbey Dore

==Political control==
The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 1998 was always held by independent councillors:

==Premises==
When first created the council inherited various offices from its predecessor authorities. In 1977 it bought a large former house called Brockington at 35 Haford Road in Hereford, outside the council&#x27;s administrative area. Brockington had been built in 1909 and had served as the headquarters of Herefordshire Constabulary since 1946. The building was converted to become the council&#x27;s headquarters and was substantially extended. The council also maintained an area office at the old Ross-on-Wye Urban District Council Chambers at 20 Broad Street.

<text>This article features a list of [[neighborhood]]s in [[the Bronx]], one of the five boroughs of New York City.

When using this article, note that names of many (but not all) neighborhoods in the Bronx are popular based on their historical pedigree and the livability factor. However, this is not true for all neighborhoods in the Bronx; while someone living at East 213th Street &amp; White Plains Road might prefer to describe their location simply as &quot;Gun Hill Road&quot; (a nearby thoroughfare) rather than &quot;Williamsbridge&quot;. Other neighborhood names have greater popularity. For example, Riverdale was once home to John F. Kennedy and is known for its affluence, large mansions, and proximity to amenities. Throggs Neck has a bridge named for it, and the neighborhood is known for waterfront beach communities located on the Long Island Sound.

==Regions of the Bronx==
Generally speaking, there are two major systems of dividing the Bronx into regions, which often conflict with one another. One is based on the Bronx River while the other strictly separate South Bronx from the rest of the borough. The older of the two systems is based on the Bronx River and is arguably a more accurate reflection of the area&#x27;s history:

*West Bronx: all parts of the Bronx west of the Bronx River (as opposed to Jerome Avenue – this street is simply the &quot;east-west&quot; divider for designating numbered streets as &quot;east&quot; or &quot;west.&quot; As the Bronx&#x27;s numbered streets continue from Manhattan to south, on which the street numbering system is based, Jerome Avenue actually represents a longitudinal halfway point for Manhattan, not the Bronx.)
*East Bronx: all parts of the Bronx east of the Bronx River (as opposed to Jerome Avenue)

The Bronx River divides the borough nearly perfectly in half, putting the earlier-settled, more urban, and hillier sections in the western lobe and the newer, more suburbanesque coastal sections in the eastern lobe. It is an accurate reflection on the Bronx&#x27;s history considering that the towns that existed in the area prior to annexation to the City of New York generally did not straddle the Bronx River. In addition, what is today the Bronx was annexed to New York City in two stages: areas west of the Bronx River were annexed in 1874 while areas to the east of the river were annexed in 1895.

Using this system, the Bronx can be further divided into the following regions:

*Northwest Bronx: the northern half of the West Bronx; the area north of Fordham road and west of the Bronx River
*Southwest Bronx: the southern half of the West Bronx; the area south of Fordham road and west of the Bronx River
*Northeast Bronx: the northern half of the East Bronx; the area north of Pelham Parkway and east of the Bronx River
*Southeast Bronx: the southern half of the East Bronx; the area south of Pelham Parkway and east of the Bronx River

A second system divides the borough first and foremost into the following sections:

*North Bronx: all areas not in the South Bronx (Southwest Bronx) – i.e. the Northwest Bronx, Northeast Bronx, and Southeast Bronx
*South Bronx: the Southwest Bronx – south of Fordham road and west of the Bronx River. This includes the areas traditionally considered part of the South Bronx.

<doc id="630676" wikidata="Q4784082" url="?curid=630676" title="Araneta City">
<text>Araneta City (stylized in all lowercase), formerly and still commonly known as Araneta Center, is a transit oriented, commercial mixed-use urban development in Quezon City, Philippines. Situated in Barangay Socorro in Cubao, and at the intersection of two major roads, Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) and Aurora Boulevard, the area offers retail, dining, entertainment, residential, office, lodging and parking facilities throughout the complex and hosts over 1 million people daily, due to its close proximity to transport terminals, including the railway stations of the MRT Line 3 and the LRT Line 2.

Located within the complex are key structures such as the Gateway Mall, the Araneta Coliseum, the New Frontier Theater, Ali Mall, Farmers Market, and Farmers Plaza. The entire complex is owned by ACI, Inc., a subsidiary of the Araneta Group, who also serves as the developer and manager of the commercial area. ACI, Inc. is also currently in charge of spearheading a redevelopment master plan after years of delays and issues, which aims to transform the area into a &quot;garden city&quot; and consists of additional buildings, shopping malls, and other high-rise facilities within the complex, set to be completed within 2030.

==History==
=== Early History ===
The property where the Araneta City, formerly named Araneta Center, is located in Quezon City, and was purchased by J. Amado Araneta in 1952, after the family&#x27;s mansion in Taft Avenue, Manila was destroyed during the Battle of Manila in 1945. The land stood on bedrock, and has an elevation level of 43 meters, which is the highest point of the Metro Manila, located between Highway 54 (now Epifanio de los Santos Avenue), Aurora Boulevard, and P. Tuazon Boulevard; and along Gen. Romulo Avenue. As of 1959, the area was remote and located in an area designated for suburban mass housing and frequented by Hukbalahap rebels. The original owner of the property was the Radio Corporation of America (RCA).

=== Development ===
In 1953, Araneta initially only purchased of land from RCA, where he built his residence, which would become known as the &quot;Bahay na Puti&quot; (White House). It was in 1955 that Araneta purchased the remaining from the RCA. After purchasing the land, Araneta envisioned the area as a potential mixed-use area.

In 1956, Araneta sold a portion of the property to the Philippine National Bank which proceeded to set up a branch in the area. On the same year, the first Aguinaldo Department Store, a well-known retailer established its first branch beyond Manila. Araneta&#x27;s Progressive Development Corporation (PDC) relocated its offices from Plaza Cervantes in Binondo, Manila to the Araneta Enterprise Building along Aurora Avenue. PDC would be later tasked to develop the Araneta Coliseum.

In the following years after the opening of the Araneta Coliseum in 1960, rapid development took place in the area. From the 1960s until the 1980s, there was a construction boom around the complex, and the area became a bustling entertainment and leisure hub, with the creation of the first strip mall in the country composed of 147 stores, located along Aurora Boulevard, and the creation of Ali Mall, SM Cubao, Fiesta Carnival (later the site of a Shopwise hypermarket), Plaza Fair, New Frontier Theater, Rustan&#x27;s Superstore, National Book Store Superbranch, COD Department Store, Matsuzakaya Department Store and Matsuzakaya House, Uniwide Cubao, Farmers Plaza, Farmer&#x27;s Market, and the Aurora Tower. The developments around the complex caused the area to prosper over the years and competed with other business districts in the Metro, such as Manila, the Makati Central Business District, the Greenhills Center, and the Ortigas Center.

The Araneta City and the surrounding areas also served as the home of many movie theaters such as the Nation Cinerama, Quezon Theater, Cinema 21, Sampaguita Theater, ACT Theater, Ocean Theater, Diamond Theater, Remar Theater, Alta Cinema, and Coronet Theater, all of which were constructed and completed between the years 1969-1974. Many of these establishments however have been closed by the end of the 1990s, with the buildings either repurposed for commercial purposes or demolished to give way to future developments due to the introduction of the home entertainment systems, supported with the rising usage of compact discs from the 1990s to the 2000s, and the creation of in-house movie theaters inside the shopping malls in the Metro that led to lesser patronage to these movie theaters.

It was during the late 1980s where the complex began losing steam and encountered numerous problems within its properties, from the Farmers Plaza fire to the coups against the Presidency of Corazon Aquino, the Araneta Group also faced numerous uncertainties and rising competition from newer mixed-use developments with more advantageous locations within Manila and Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The following problems created an urban decay within the area, a capital slump within the Araneta Group&#x27;s finances, and neglect on their buildings, causing rising crime rates and low business opportunities, prompting the Araneta group to temporarily use their capital to maintain the properties within the area, and halt their future plans and proposals to upgrade the area&#x27;s potential and other big-scale redevelopment plans within the area. One noted planned development is the &quot;Manhattan Tower&quot; project, a mixed-use, high-rise development with retail and residential facilities. The problem also caused the Araneta Group to strengthen its key subsidiaries to finance the company&#x27;s future projects.

===Redevelopment===

During the construction of the MRT Line 3 along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) in 1996, the Araneta Group saw the potential opportunity to revamp the complex and proposed plans to once again begin its redevelopment plans and push the company&#x27;s plans for long-term development. The redevelopment dream was further titillated in the aftermath of the construction of the LRT Line 2 a year later, and prompted J. Amado&#x27;s son, Jorge L. Araneta to launch a multi-phase master plan to reinvigorate their long-waited vision. In January 1997, plans were also laid out to create a joint venture partnership with Ayala Land and Atok-Big Wedge Co. to push for the area&#x27;s revival and redevelopment, which is expected to be worth ₱140 billion ($5.32 billion). After a series of negotiations, and along the uncertainties caused by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the Araneta Group decided to drop the proposal in order to push their own redevelopment plan using the company&#x27;s own finances assisted by various bank loans.

With the ambition of regaining its former glory, a 20-year redevelopment project, known as the Araneta Center Master Plan, was formulated in 1999 and was unveiled in 2000, with an estimated budget of over ₱80 billion ($1.62 billion), and began its implementation in 1999 with the renovation of the Araneta Coliseum and the Farmers Plaza, which was completed in 2001. The redevelopment master plan is envisioned to turn the complex into an inter-connected, transit oriented &quot;Garden City&quot; concept, promoting connectivity, green architecture and open spaces within its buildings. Araneta also hired the international architectural firm RTKL Associates, along with local architectural firms Palafox Associates, owned by Felino Palafox, ASYA Design, and Aidea, for the redevelopment master plan. Araneta also tapped Deshazo Starek and Tang (now Deshazo Group), Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated and Colliers International to serve as the main consultants of the master plan. The plans for the master plan include additional malls, towers and renovated facilities within the complex, including the &quot;Millenium Mall&quot; project, a planned 7-storey mall which is interconnected to the Araneta Coliseum, the &quot;Manila Tower&quot;, a planned mixed-use tower with communications facilities, and a modernization of the complex&#x27;s entertainment venues, the Araneta Coliseum and the New Frontier Theater. The redevelopment is also envisioned to have a of total retail floor area.
The first phase of the redevelopment plan, totaling over ₱30 billion ($608 million) began in 2002 with the construction of the Gateway Mall, completed in 2004, which was followed by the construction of the Gateway Office in 2005, a major renovation of the Araneta Coliseum, as well as the rehabilitation of the New Frontier Theater, which were completed in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

The completion of the first phase is set within 2024, with the completion of the Manhattan Plaza Tower 2 and opening of the upcoming Gateway Mall 2 and Ibis Styles Araneta City.

The second phase, totaling over ₱50 billion ($1.01 billion) is set to begin in the next few years, and will include the development of 3 additional Cyberpark Towers, 6 additional Manhattan Gardens Towers, and the Gateway Mall 3. The phase will also include the construction of the City Plaza, a Mixed-use development, and the Icon Tower, a planned 40+ storey tower, connected from the Manhattan Plaza. The master plan will also include a multi-billion dollar Integrated resort consisting hotels, dining, entertainment, gaming, conventions and conferences, luxurious retail shops, a modernised Farmer&#x27;s Market, and a heritage area located along EDSA, spanning from the Farmer&#x27;s Market and its surrounding buildings, up to the Farmer&#x27;s Garden area; and a planned expansion of Ali Mall, which includes a 4-tower mixed-use development located along the northern area of the mall. The overall redevelopment master-plan covers square meters of gross floor area and are set within the target completion date of 2030, as part of the company&#x27;s Vision 2030 plan within the area. On September 24, 2019, the Araneta Center was renamed as Araneta City after a brand relaunch.

<text>Artur Mas i Gavarró (; born 31 January 1956) is a Catalan politician. He was president of the Government of Catalonia from 2010 to 2015 and acting president from September 2015 to 12 January 2016.

Mas is a long time member of Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC by its Catalan acronym) which used to be the bigger of the two component members –along with Unió Democràtica de Catalunya– of what at the time was a long-standing electoral coalition, Convergència i Unió (CiU), a liberal nationalist coalition which had dominated Catalan regional politics since the 1980s. In 2001 Mas was named general secretary of CDC, then, in 2012 he was named president of the party until the party was refounded in July 2016 as PDeCAT, which he presided between July 2016 and January 2018.

From 2003 to 2015, Mas has run five times for the Catalan presidency, four heading the –nowadays defunct– CiU ticket and one running for the novel Junts pel Sí coalition. He attained the presidency in two elections, 2010 and 2012 (both running for CiU) but neither with an absolute majority. In the absence of single party majorities, both tenures were marked by political instability and ended with Mas calling a snap election.

Mas is an economist who obtained his degree from the University of Barcelona, and is fluent in English and French, in addition to Catalan and Spanish.

His ideology tends to be considered liberal from the economic point of view and supportive of Catalan independence. From the social point of view, he has mostly supported a moderate agenda in numerous issues, such as gay rights, but not same-sex marriage and free debate on his party concerning abortion.

In 2010, for the first time, Mas indicated he would vote &quot;Yes&quot; on a hypothetical referendum to secede from Spain. Since then, sovereignty and Catalan independence have become the central part of his political agenda, with Mas being instrumental in CDC&#x27;s novel turn towards separatism.

== Early life==
Mas was born in Barcelona as one of the four children of a wealthy industrialist family. His mother was originally from Sabadell and his father from Poblenou. He studied at the &quot;Aula escola europea&quot;, and is thereby fluent in French, English, Catalan and Spanish. Later he graduated in Economics from the University of Barcelona and married Helena Rakòsnik.

Juan Mas Roig, great-great-grandfather of the former president of the Generalitat Artur Mas, was a slave ship captain who in 1844 moved 825 slaves from Africa to Brazil.

==Politics==
Before acquiring political responsibilities in Catalonia, Mas held different posts in both the private and public sectors, especially relating to the internationalization of Catalan enterprises. He was a member of the Barcelona City Council from 1987 to 1995, representing the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia. His first high responsibilities in the Catalan government came during the presidency of Jordi Pujol, President of the Generalitat de Catalunya from 1980 to 2003. Artur Mas served as Catalan Minister of Public Works from 1995 to 1997, as Minister of Economy and Finance from 1997 to 2001, and Deputy Prime Minister (&quot;conseller en cap&quot;) from 2001 to 2003, as well as being the government&#x27;s official spokesman from 2000 to 2003.

Artur Mas ran for the 2003 elections to the Catalan government and won a plurality of seats in the parliament, with four more than PSC. However, the latter obtained a slightly larger number of votes (this discrepancy between votes and seats obtained is explained by the electoral law and the way seats are assigned). Finally PSC&#x27;s Pasqual Maragall was elected President, having forged a coalition with two other left-wing parties, the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Initiative for Catalonia – Greens (ICV).

Mas ran again for president in the 2006 elections. Though his party CiU won these both in number of votes and seats—unlike in the previous election– it did not reach the absolute majority of seats in the parliament, allowing PSC&#x27;s new candidate, José Montilla, to reach an absolute majority by repeating the coalition government with the same left-wing partners (ERC and ICV).


Since 2007, he has put special emphasis on initiating a process, known as the &quot;Refoundation of Catalanism&quot; (in Catalan, &quot;Refundació del catalanisme&quot;), to build upon the principles and values of the Catalanist movement, in order to enlarge the majority of society in Catalonia that expresses a nationalist feeling, and not merely inside his own party, CDC. The &#x27;Refoundation of Catalanism&#x27; that Mas is actively leading calls for Catalonia to obtain the so-called &#x27;Right to decide&#x27; on matters that affect it. This implicitly includes the possibility of putting independence from Spain to a hypothetical referendum. This point is significantly closer to the traditionally more separatist positions of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya and has gained momentum since the issue of the verdict on the Catalan Statute—the &quot;Estatut&quot;—in July 2010 by the Spanish Constitutional Court, which invalidates certain parts of this law although they were backed by a large majority of Catalan voters by referendum back in 2006 (73.9 Yes, 20.7% No, 49.4% Turnout).

On 9 January 2018, he resigned as president of the PDeCAT, decision that he had made months previously but postponed because of the political crisis. According to what he said, this did not mean his abandoning politics, but that it was taking a back seat.

==Presidency==

===2010–2012===
The Catalan elections that took place on 28 November 2010 were to finally determine the political future of Mas, who was for the third time CiU&#x27;s candidate to the presidency. During the campaign Mas had promised to put into place the government of &#x27;the best&#x27; people, including the possibility of appointing ministers (&#x27;Consellers&#x27;) from outside his political coalition, Convergència i Unió, if their talent justified doing so. Moreover, he also engaged in a process which would culminate in full powers over taxation for Catalonia—significantly reducing the so-called &#x27;fiscal deficit&#x27; between Catalonia and the whole of Spain—by putting this issue to referendum to the Catalans and as a condition for giving any support to Spanish governments after the Spanish elections scheduled for 2012.

Surveys had indicated that this time his party would obtain enough seats to govern without being heavily dependent on third parties and with no risk of a repetition of left-wing coalitions like those of 2003 and 2006. In the event, CiU won 62 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament, short of an absolute majority.

He was eventually invested as president of the Generalitat on 23 December 2010 thanks to an agreement to get the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC) abstention in the vote In the investiture speech, Mas claimed a new funding model for Catalonia inspired by the Economic Agreement and proclaimed the Catalonia national transition based on the &quot;right to decide&quot;.

The agreement with the PSC proved fragile, which forced Mas to seek new allies in the regional parliament, this time engaging in talks with the Popular Party (PP). By negotiating PP&#x27;s abstention, Mas was eventually able to pass the 2012 public budget.

===2012–2015: Catalan independence movement===

In September 2012, less than 2 years into his first term and only months after having closed a de facto agreement with the PP, Artur Mas declared in a speech to Parliament that it was time for the people of Catalonia to exercise the right of self-determination. The declaration had come as fallout from the massive 2012 Catalan independence demonstration which had gathered an estimated number of participants ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million. Hence, on 25 September 2012, Mas announced snap elections for the Parliament of Catalonia to be held on 25 November and argued, referring to the demonstration, that &quot;the street vocal must be moved to the polls&quot;.

Despite Mas going to the polls with a view to attain an absolute majority in the regional parliament Mas&#x27; led coalition lost in the event 12 seats, making it the biggest loser out of the snap election. Still, the sum of parties defending Catalonia&#x27;s independence from Spain (CiU and ERC) significantly increased their votes due to ERC&#x27;s growth compensating CiU&#x27;s losses; the aggregated support for both parties reached 44.4% of the total and thanks to the electoral law this combined rate was enough to ensure that between both parties they could control more than half the Catalan Parliament seats.

As a result of the election, Mas, on behalf of CiU, had to engage in talks for a stable government, this time with Oriol Junqueras (ERC), who refused to enter a coalition government with Mas but stayed as Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of Catalonia; however, ERC agreed general support to the CiU government and CiU agreed to coordinate with ERC the goals of the legislature; this was termed by the signataries as the &quot;Agreement for Freedom&quot;. Artur Mas was invested for the second time President of Catalonia on 21 December 2012 and on 24 December he took up office at the Palace of the Government of Catalonia.

On 12 December 2013, Artur Mas, with leaders of five Catalan parliamentary parties, announced the date for the Catalan self-determination referendum, that was set for Sunday 9 November 2014 and contained a question with two sections: &quot;Do you want Catalonia to become a State?&quot; and &quot;In case of an affirmative response, do you want this State to be independent?&quot;. In April 2014 the proposal was presented to the Spanish Parliament and it was defeated by a vote of 299–47. Mas, both before and after this vote has declared that the referendum would take place in a legal manner, but under the Spanish Constitution, referendums on sovereignty must be held nationally and not regionally, which prompted the Spanish government to veto any such referendum.
===Conviction===

Mas intended to avoid prosecution by reducing it to a non-binding and purely symbolic vote, and staffing it with volunteers. Despite these efforts the Spanish Central Government still deemed the vote as unconstitutional and thus illegal. Eventually, Mas went ahead in defiance of an order from Spain&#x27;s constitutional court, leading to his trial. Mas was charged by the attorney general with perverting the course of justice, misuse of public funds and abuse of power, with regards to the role he assumed in the unofficial referendum. A trial was opened, Mas rested accused of abuse of power and disobedience, as a result facing a ban from holding public office of up to 10 years.

In the event, in March 2017 Mas was barred from public office for two years by a court in Barcelona for organizing an illegal vote in defiance of the Spanish courts. He was also fined 36,500 euros.

== Stances ==
In February 2012, in an interview to &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;, Mas made a statement saying that &quot;the cultural DNA of Catalans is intertwined with our long belonging to the Franco-Germanic world. Catalonia, after all, long belonged to the Marca Hispanica and its capital was Aachen, the heart of the Carolingian Empire. Something must endure in our DNA, because we Catalans have an umbilical cord that makes us more Germanic than Roman.&quot;

Mas espouses the vision that &quot;Spain can only become a &quot;full&quot; nation if Catalonia ceases to be a part of it&quot;.

==2015 election==

As a result of the political instability resulting from the referendum issue, Mas called a second consecutive snap election. Due to internal tensions within the coalition regarding the separatist turn led by Mas, CDC and Unió did not agree to reform CiU, hence putting an end to 37 years of cooperation between both parties.

Instead, CDC joined forces with ERC in Junts pel Sí, a novel coalition which made public that Mas was going to be its candidate for the presidency, despite not being headed by him (as a result of balance of power negotiations within the coalition, Mas was placed fourth in the electoral ticket). The new coalition attained 62 seats, failing to secure an absolute majority. Unlike the previous election in 2012, support from other parties in the regional parliament could not be taken for granted in 2015, because ERC, which had previously supported CiU&#x27;s government, had joined CDC in the Junts pel Sí coalition.

The only prospective partner willing to negotiate with Junts pel Sí was the far-left separatist party Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP). After a lengthy period of negotiations started just after the election took place on September 27, Mas was vetoed by the CUP. In January 2016, after three months of what was defined as &quot;rancorous infighting&quot; in the separatist camp, Mas eventually stepped down at the eleventh hour from his candidature for the presidency in order to allow a government to be formed and a third consecutive snap election to be avoided. At that point, Mas also resigned from his seat in the parliament, remarking that he would place his “personal efforts in rebuilding what Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (CDC) means and represents in Catalonia”.

Subsequently, as CDC was refounded as PDeCAT, Mas retained the presidential role in the refounded party. On 9 January 2018, he renounced the presidential role of PDeCAT.

== Postal mail, ZIP Codes, and neighborhoods ==
Unlike neighborhoods in the other four boroughs, some Queens neighborhood names are used as the town name in postal addresses. For example, whereas the &quot;town, state&quot; construction for all addresses in Manhattan is &quot;New York, New York&quot; (except in Marble Hill, where &quot;Bronx, New York&quot; is used), and all neighborhoods in Brooklyn use &quot;Brooklyn, New York&quot;, residents of College Point would use the construction &quot;College Point, New York&quot; or &quot;Flushing, New York&quot; instead of &quot;Queens, New York&quot;.

From the time of the inception of the ZIP Code system until 1998, the postal zones of Queens and western Nassau County—whose secession from Queens County in 1899 did not affect postal routes—were organized based on which main post office routed the neighborhood&#x27;s postal mail. The name of the main post office was the default name of the corresponding ZIP Code. For example, Fresh Meadows postal mail was routed through the main post office in Flushing, and Fresh Meadows&#x27; ZIP Codes 11365 and 11366 were both labeled as &quot;Flushing&quot;. 

At the urging of the citizens of Queens and with the support of Congressman Gary Ackerman, ZIP Codes are also named after the main post office they serve. The original ZIP Codes themselves are still used by the USPS for mail delivery purposes. Queens neighborhoods may have one of the following ZIP Code prefixes, which are classified under the following main post offices:

* 111: Long Island City
* 113: Flushing
* 114: Jamaica
* 116: Rockaway

<text>The Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Japan is the United Kingdom&#x27;s foremost diplomatic representative in Japan, and is the head of the UK&#x27;s diplomatic mission there.

The following is a chronological list of British heads of mission (ministers and ambassadors) in Japan from 1859. Before 1905, there were no ambassadors exchanged between the two countries, the highest rank being envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiarya rank just below ambassador. Before 1859, there was no treaty and no diplomatic relations, because Japan was isolated from the world by the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s policy of national isolation called &quot;sakoku&quot; (literally &quot;locked country&quot;).

Bargalló contested the 1992 regional election as an independent Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) candidate in the Province of Tarragona and was elected to the Parliament of Catalonia. He joined ERC in 1995. He was re-elected at the 1995 and 1999 regional elections.

Bargalló contested the 1995 local elections as an ERC candidate in Torredembarra and was elected. He was re-elected at the 1999 and 2003 local elections. He was deputy mayor of Torredembarra from 1999 and 2003.

Bargalló chose to retire from politics in 2003 and at the 2003 regional election he was placed 18th on ERC&#x27;s list of candidates in the Province of Tarragona but as the party only managed to win three seats in the province he was not re-elected. However, after the election leftist parties formed a government led by Pasqual Maragall and in December 2003 Bargalló was appointed Minister of Education. He was appointed Chief Advisor (re-designated First Minister in March 2005) in February 2014 following the resignation of Josep-Lluís Carod-Rovira. Bargalló and other ERC ministers were sacked from the government in May 2006 as a result the ERC&#x27;s refusal to support the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia.

<doc id="630696" wikidata="Q6952335" url="?curid=630696" title="NAPLEX">
<text>The North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) is a standard examination created by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) to help individual state boards of pharmacy assess an individual&#x27;s competency and knowledge so that they may be given a license to practice. The NABP has announced that as of November 2016, the fee to take the exam, the number of exam questions, and the time to sit for the exam have all increased.

==History==
NABP started the development of a standardized national examination in 1958 by Dr. Fred T. Mahaffey. The effort led to the eventual formation of Blue Ribbon Committee in 1968 and Blue Ribbon Examination in 1971. Blue Ribbon Examination was renamed to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy Licensure Examination (NABPLEX) in 1975. All state boards of pharmacy with the exception of California used NABPLEX by 1986. In March 1997, the NABPLEX was renamed to the NAPLEX. California recognized the NAPLEX in 2004. Until 1997, the examination was in a paper and pencil format utilized since 1976 which was replaced with a computer-adaptive test administered at contracted testing centers.

==Exam Format==
The NAPLEX is exclusively a computer-administered exam. After receiving an authorization to test from NABP, applicants must register with an official testing facility, such as Pearson VUE, at least two business days in advance to schedule a testing appointment. The NABP&#x27;s announcement of updates to the 2016 NAPLEX exam include increased fee price, number of exam questions, and time to sit for the exam. Number of exam questions increased from 185 to 225, and time to sit for the exam has increased from 4 hours and 15 minutes to 6 hours total. Of the 225 questions, only 200 are used to tabulate the applicant&#x27;s score. The remaining questions are &quot;trial balloon&quot; questions under consideration for inclusion on future NAPLEX tests. There is no way to distinguish a regular test question from a trial balloon question. As of March 2024, the NAPLEX exam fee increased from $475 to $520. 

Prior to the changes in November 2016, the NAPLEX exam was presented as a computer adaptive exam in which the delivery of questions was modified based on the response of the test taker and questions on a specific subject may have increased or decreased in difficulty as the test progressed. The new exam is a pre-assembled linear format (standardized delivery for all test-takers) and will no longer adjust the exam based on user responses.

There are several question types on the NAPLEX: multiple choice, select all that apply, point and click (to select a place on a picture or graph for the purpose of mechanisms of action, site of action, application or injection site, etc.), and sequencing. Essay and short answer are not included and, though previously used, K-type questions have been eliminated.

==Results==
Exam results are typically reported seven business days after administration. Applicants may access their scores on the website of the state Board of Pharmacy. A tabulated or &quot;scaled&quot; score of 75 or higher (out of a possible 150) is required for passing. Reported scores are not percentage values, nor are they some configuration of right versus wrong. Rather, they represent a mathematically calculated &quot;ability measure&quot; of the applicant based on an algorithm developed by the National Associations of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP).&lt;ref name = &quot;NAPLEX/MPJE Registration Bulletin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Applicants not obtaining a score of 75 or higher are given a performance profile, which details their relative areas of strength and weakness. They must wait at least 45 days (previously 91 days) before retaking the NAPLEX.

<doc id="630700" wikidata="Q3000363" url="?curid=630700" title="Voyageurs Cup">
<text>The Voyageurs Cup () is the domestic trophy for professional soccer in Canada, awarded to the best men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clubs in the country. 

The Cup was conceived and commissioned by fans of the Canada men&#x27;s national team, the Voyageurs, in 2002. From 2002 to 2007, the cup was awarded annually to the Canadian team finishing with the best record in the USL First Division, from regular-season matches against other Canadian teams in the league. Since 2008, the trophy has been presented to the winner of the Canadian Championship, which also awards Canada&#x27;s berth in the CONCACAF Champions Cup. The current men&#x27;s cup holders are Vancouver Whitecaps FC, after winning the 2024 Canadian Championship.

==History==
The Voyageurs Cup was first conceived in March 2002 by fans of the Canada men&#x27;s national team, known as the Voyageurs, following Canada&#x27;s surprise success at the 2000 Gold Cup. After years of being promised a domestic Canadian cup by the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA), the Voyageurs took it upon themselves to commission a national trophy using member donations. Veteran Voyageurs member and chief fundraiser since the group&#x27;s founding in 1996, Dwayne Cole, solicited donations on the Voyageurs internet forum, resulting in $3,500–4,000 donated. The money was used to commission the trophy, made in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The cup itself is a handled wine cooler made from solid brass and electroplated in sterling silver. The base is lacquered, solid Canadian Oak and set with die cut polished aluminum maple leaf annual plates. An accompanying solid oak case was also crafted for safe transport. The cost of engraving, shipping, maintenance, and promotion of the trophy continued to be paid for by private donations from individual members of the Voyageurs until 2008.

The group agreed to award the cup to whichever of the four Canadian clubs in the USL A-League – the Montreal Impact, Vancouver Whitecaps, Toronto Lynx and Calgary Storm – collected the most points against each other during the regular USL season.

Prior to the start of the 2007 USL season, the Toronto Lynx self-relegated to the Premier Development League, and effectively withdrew from the Voyageurs Cup competition in the process. As a result, in 2007 the trophy was decided solely on regular-season results between the Montreal Impact and the Vancouver Whitecaps FC.

Following the creation of the Canadian Championship, a separate tournament that would include the two remaining Canadian clubs from the USL First Division, and Toronto FC of Major League Soccer, the trophy was handed over to the Canadian Soccer Association in 2008 to be presented to the Canadian Championship winners. The terms of the agreement were to be reviewed in 2010. 

The Montreal Impact won the first seven titles, the first six by virtue of their regular-season record in the USL against other Canadian sides. They won the inaugural 2008 Canadian Championship to retain the trophy, their seventh straight Voyageurs Cup victory. Toronto FC won the 2009 Canadian Championship to win the Voyageurs Cup for the first time. After thirteen unsuccessful attempts, the Vancouver Whitecaps FC won their first Voyageurs Cup title in 2015. The Calgary Storm never finished higher than fourth in the competition while the Edmonton Aviators finished third in their lone appearance in the tournament. Both Alberta teams folded after the 2004 season. The Toronto Lynx finished as runners-up in four of the five years they participated. FC Edmonton played in five consecutive Canadian Championship semi-finals from 2011 to 2015, but were never able to reach the final. The closest they came was in 2014, when they had almost defeated the Montreal Impact on away goals, but conceded from a penalty kick in the 90+7th minute to lose 4–5 on aggregate.

There was also a Voyageurs Cup West for Women and Voyageurs Cup East for Women awarded since 2004. The first and only Women&#x27;s Voyageurs Super Cup was contested in 2006.

==Format==
===2002–2007: USL era===
Prior to 2008, the men&#x27;s title was decided on regular-season matches between Canada&#x27;s USL A-League/USL First Division sides.
===2008–2010: Canadian Championship, round robin format===
The inaugural Canadian Championship was held in 2008, with the three Canadian teams spread across MLS (Toronto FC) and the USL First Division (Montreal Impact and Vancouver Whitecaps) each playing four non-League games in a round robin format.
===2011–present: Canadian Championship, knockout format===
Beginning with the 2011 tournament, the format was different from previous editions. In 2011, with four teams involved, the tournament was changed to be a home-and-away semi-final round and a similar final round between the winners. Toronto, as reigning champions, were assigned the top seed and were matched with Edmonton, which was assigned the fourth seed as newcomers to the tournament. The two remaining teams, Montreal and Vancouver, faced off in the other semi-final.

<text>Two English Girls (; UK title: Anne and Muriel), is a 1971 French romantic drama film directed by François Truffaut and adapted from a 1956 novel of the same name by Henri-Pierre Roché. It stars Jean-Pierre Léaud as Claude, Kika Markham as Anne, and Stacey Tendeter as Muriel. Truffaut restored 20 minutes of footage, which fills out the characters, before his death in 1984.

The novel was first published in English in 2004, translated by Walter Bruno and published by Cambridge Book Review Press, Cambridge, Wisconsin.

==Plot==
The film begins in Paris around the year 1902. The narrator (Truffaut himself) explains that Claude Roc and his widowed mother are visited by Anne Brown, daughter of an old friend. Anne invites Claude to spend the summer on the coast of Wales with her widowed mother and sister, Muriel. While she enjoys Claude&#x27;s company, her hope is that he may be a husband for her introverted sister, who has problems with her eyesight. In the event, Claude and Muriel do start to fall in love and Claude overcomes her initial resistance and persuades her to agree to marriage. Madame Roc, supposedly concerned about their poor health and with the agreement of Mrs Brown, says they must live apart for a year without any communication before getting married.

Returning to France, Claude moves in artistic circles and has affairs with a number of women while Muriel in Wales keeps a diary and becomes increasingly despondent. Claude, with his mother&#x27;s encouragement, writes to Muriel, breaking off the engagement, as he wishes to be free to focus on his business pursuits. Muriel is devastated. Anne leaves home to study sculpture in Paris, where she loses her virginity to Claude. She agrees to have a non-exclusive affair with Claude, enabling him to continue to have affairs with other women, and eventually has a concurrent relationship with Diurka, a dashing publisher who then takes her off to Persia with Claude&#x27;s encouragement. Muriel sends her diary, which includes details of her experience of a childhood lesbian event and her consequent prolonged struggle against an urge for masturbation, to Claude, who publishes it against her wishes.

Muriel comes to Paris and she and Claude rekindle their love. However, when Muriel is told by Anne of Claude&#x27;s affair with her, at Claude&#x27;s insistence, she collapses into deep depression and returns to Wales. Anne has become engaged to a Frenchman called Nicholas but falls ill and also returns to Wales, dying among her family with Diurka at her side.

Diurka tells Claude that Muriel is leaving home to take a job in Belgium. Claude meets her ship at Calais and they spend that night together in a hotel, during which Muriel also loses her virginity. In the morning, she says they must now part for ever as Claude is unsuited for matrimony, despite his renewed offer of marriage. Later, she writes to say she is pregnant, raising Claude&#x27;s hopes of marriage, but a second letter says she was mistaken and their relationship is truly at an end. He later hears that Muriel has married and is a schoolteacher with a daughter. Claude turns the whole saga of his relationship with the sisters into a novel, which is published by Diurka.

In an epilogue set in the 1920s, the narrator explains that Claude, who is now a successful author, but unmarried, and whose mother has died, still dreams of the artistic gifts of Anne and the children he and Muriel might have had.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 87% based on reviews from 15 critics.

Albert Johnson wrote about the film for its local premiere at the San Francisco Film Festival in 1972: &quot;The film is a gorgeously colorful, poignant romance, as delicately ornate and rare as an enamel brooch by Lalique. Truffaut is a genius at this sort of haunting love story, and &quot;Two English Girls&quot; is cinema-perfection.&quot;

The film was a box office flop in France, Truffaut&#x27;s first unsuccessful film domestically since &quot;The Soft Skin&quot;.

Disappointed with its reception in France, Truffaut decided to restore over 20 minutes of footage to the film, a project he completed just before he died in 1984. This version was released after his death in 1985. Critics such as Tom Wiener believe it improved the film.

<text>Gun, with Occasional Music is a 1994 novel by American writer Jonathan Lethem that blends science fiction and hardboiled detective fiction. The novel won Lethem the Locus Award for Best First Novel in 1995. It was also nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1994 and the cover art, illustrated by pulp artist Michael Koelsch, was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Original Art Work in 1995.

==Plot==
The novel follows the adventures of Conrad Metcalf, a tough, smart-alecky private detective, through a futuristic version of San Francisco and Oakland, California. Metcalf is hired by a man who claims that he&#x27;s being framed for the murder of a prominent urologist. Metcalf quickly discovers that nobody wants the case solved: not the victim&#x27;s ex-wife, not the police, and certainly not the gun-toting kangaroo who works for the local mafia boss.

==Major themes==

In the novel, thanks to technology, children can become smarter and more cynical than adults; such children are known as &quot;baby-heads&quot;. &quot;Baby-heads&quot; have their own subculture and bars, and can drink alcohol. Animals, too, can be given the intelligence of a human being through bioscientific techniques, a concept explored previously by David Brin in his &quot;Uplift&quot; novels, Roger Zelazny in &quot;The Dream Master,&quot; and in Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s &quot;Sirius&quot;. Lethem&#x27;s animals stand midway between these two; like Brin&#x27;s, they have clearly delineated and delimited rights; like Zelazny&#x27;s, however, they are part of a darker symbolism. It is not considered bestiality when one has a sexual relationship with an evolved animal in this world, and humans may also adopt younger evolved animals.

Lethem also envisions nerve-swapping technology. Couples trade erogenous zones for the purpose of sexual experimentation. Metcalf previously underwent such a procedure, and is now trapped with a woman&#x27;s neuro-sexual apparatus because his girlfriend skipped town with his male one.

There are other incidental touches. For an unexplained reason, psychology is no longer viewed as a science, and psychologists behave like Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other itinerant proselytizing religions. One such couple asks Metcalf if he&#x27;d like to listen to selections from Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;Civilization and Its Discontents&quot;. In this future, television is now an abstract art form, and has abandoned linear narrative sequence genres.

People are more easily disconcerted in Lethem&#x27;s future. Asking questions is considered astonishingly rude, making detectives (or &quot;inquisitors&quot;, as they are known), whose job involves prying, social pariahs. Rather than broadcast bad news to squeamish listeners, the radio plays ominous music instead. (Handguns also come with threatening violin soundtracks.) And everyone is &quot;on the make&quot;--&quot;make&quot; being a snortable drug available in a dozen different blends (Acceptol, Avoidol, Forgettol) in stores called &#x27;. But substance abuse still exists in this future- there is a lucrative black market in &#x27;, an earlier version of and , but highly addictive nevertheless. Pansy Greenleaf is initially addicted to it.

Karma is also subject to transactions through portable debit cards. Once someone&#x27;s karma reaches zero, they are sentenced to specific periods of cryogenic respite until they &quot;work off&quot; their karmic &quot;debt&quot;. Lethem went on to further explore this idea in his later novel &quot;Amnesia Moon&quot;, in which &quot;luck ratings&quot; served a similar role to &quot;Gun&quot;&#x27;s karma. However, unscrupulous criminal elements in this society have developed &quot;slaveboxes&quot;, neural implants which activate the inert central nervous systems of the sleepers, using their bodies for prostitution or slave labour while unconscious.

Metcalf himself is frozen late in the book. After six years, he is thawed out, only to find that memory retention has become a social taboo, and people now have prompters installed to provide retrospective commentary about past events in their lives. As a result, &quot;&quot; only supply one standardized blend, with paramount. Private investigation is also illegal.

==Adaptations==
As of January 2020, Legendary Entertainment was developing a series based on the novel.

<text>Speeder bikes (also known as &quot;jumpspeeders&quot; or &quot;hover bikes&quot;) and swoop bikes (or just &quot;swoops&quot;) are small, fast transports that use repulsorlift engines in the fictional &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; includes a prominent speeder bike chase; speeders and swoops also appear in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope&quot; (added in the 1997 Special Edition, but absent on every earlier print), the animated TV series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe&#x27;s books, comics, and games.

==Origin and design==
Various concept sketches came from producer George Lucas&#x27; call for a &quot;rocket-powered scooter&quot; in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. While Industrial Light &amp; Magic&#x27;s (ILM) Nilo Rodis-Jamero designed a blocky vehicle with a large engine, Ralph McQuarrie&#x27;s designs were more fanciful but with less of a sense of the vehicle&#x27;s power source. The final designs resulted in full-scale Imperial speeder bikes used by the actors for film against a bluescreen, along with miniatures mounted by articulated puppets. ILM used a steadicam recording at 1 frame per second to record the speeder bikes&#x27; path through the forest moon of Endor—in reality, a California forest. Playing the footage at the standard rate of 24 frames per second caused a blurring effect, which ILM used to simulate the vehicles&#x27; high speed; what was shot at looked like . 

The BARC speeder in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; was designed to appear like a predecessor to the speeder bikes in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. ILM&#x27;s Doug Chiang designed Darth Maul&#x27;s (Ray Park) speeder in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; to resemble a scythe, and Chiang&#x27;s initial designs for the droid army&#x27;s STAP vehicle resembled the speeder bikes from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. An all-CGI swoop appearing in &quot;A New Hope&quot; stems from a design created for &quot;Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire&quot;, and the swoop also appears briefly in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.

==Depiction==
In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, speeder bikes are a type of &quot;repulsorcraft&quot;, vehicles which use anti-gravity devices called repulsorlifts to hover above the surface of a planet. Compared to other repulsorcraft, speeder bikes sacrifice unnecessary systems in order to achieve greater speed or agility. Swoop bikes, being little more than an engine with seats, are similar but better suited for operating at higher altitudes. In the &quot;Legends&quot; video game &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, swoop racing is a main part of the story with the player having to work for The Hidden Beks, a swoop gang, by infiltrating rival swoop gang, The Black Vulkars, and competing against them in a swoop race in order to rescue Bastila. &quot;Swoop racing&quot; is described as a dangerous, fast-paced competition between skilled pilots.

===Types of speeder bikes===
*74-Z Speeder Bike: The 74-Z speeder bike makes its first appearance in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; as Imperial scout troopers patrol the forest surrounding the shield generator on Endor; during the movie&#x27;s speeder bike chase Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) pilot a pair of speeders to chase down scout troopers who might reveal the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s presence on Endor. Background material on the bike explains how the 74-Z, built by the Aratech Repulsor Company, was originally used by the Republic during the Clone Wars before being adopted by the Empire. The bike measures long, can carry one or two passengers, and achieves a maximum speed of . In addition to a self-charging battery system, sensors and communication equipment, the 74-Z is armed with an Ax-20 blaster cannon, though being stripped of all excess weight the bike offers no protection for the rider.
*Sith Speeder: Darth Maul is seen using a speeder bike to chase down Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, identified in &quot;Star Wars&quot; material as a Razalon FC-20 speeder bike. It is described as being a popular model with assassins and other criminals because of its ability to perform sharp turns and a compactness that makes it harder to track, though the small size also requires it be more frequently recharged. Darth Maul&#x27;s bike, the &quot;Bloodfin&quot;, has been stripped of all weaponry and sensors to make his lighter and faster, achieving a top speed of .
*Flitknot Speeder: The Flitknot speeder bike is first seen in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, when Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) uses one to escape the battle of Geonosis to return to his solar sailer. These bikes are of simple design, with more bulk at the back in the engines than anywhere else, as well as two handholds and two footholds. They are fast and maneuverable, able to outrun Republic gunships.
*BARC Speeder: The BARC speeder first appears in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; as Jedi Master Stass Allie is turned upon by her clone trooper escorts when Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) initiates Order 66. Manufactured by the Aratech Repulsor Company, the speeder bike&#x27;s name is explained as being derived from the specialist clone troopers (Biker Advanced Recon Commandos) who typically pilot these craft. Armed with a pair of blaster cannons, the BARC speeder is long and can reach a top speed of . It normally seats only one passenger but can be modified with mission-specific sidecars.
*C-PH Patrol Speeder Bike: Also known as Imperial patrol speeders, these bikes are used by Imperial patrol troopers to police shipyards and industrial facilities of value to the Empire. Manufactured by the Aratech Repulsor Company, they use a bank of forward-facing repulsorfield vector guides. They first appear in &quot;&quot;, in which a patrol trooper piloting one such speeder pursues Han Solo and Qi&#x27;ra.
*Zephyr-J: The Zephyr-J is a model of speeder bike used in the Outer Rim territories and manufactured by Mobquet Swoops and Speeders. It makes its debut in &quot;Chapter 5: The Gunslinger&quot; of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;; the titular character uses this type of speeder.

==Cultural impact==
Ben Brosofsky of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; has called speeder bikes an iconic part of &quot;Star Wars&quot; ever since their introduction in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and described them as capturing the intensity of the movie. Ryan Britt of &quot;Inverse&quot; and Ben Sherlock of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; both describe the speeder bike chase as one of the most iconic scenes of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga. Ken Napzok in &quot;Why We Love Star Wars: The Great Moments That Built a Galaxy Far, Far Away&quot; contrasts the speeder bike chase scene with the drag race scene in &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and how both represent George Lucas&#x27; love for &quot;fast-moving things&quot;.

The speeder bike, specifically the 74-Z as seen in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, was ranked as one of the top vehicles of the Star Wars universe by Dean Evans of DRIVEN Car Guide. Described as the &quot;ultimate superbike&quot; and &quot;cooler than Boba Fett&quot;, he argues its real-world equivalent would be the Ducati 996. Ken Napzok also praises the 74-Z as being a sublime design which even young fans can grasp easily.

Many fans of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series have also been inspired to build life-size &quot;working&quot; replicas. In 2016, a group of fans used Jetovator water-propelled jet packs to create several 74-Z replicas to film a recreation of the speeder bike chase scene. Vintage Works of Green Bay, Wisconsin, built a replica 74-Z speeder bike in 2017 using a Zero electric motorcycle. Also in 2017, a team from Lithium Cycles worked with YouTube prankster Jesse to build a pair of 74-Z bikes using their Super 73 electric street motorcycles which they showed off on the streets of New York City. In order to give the appearance the vehicles &quot;hovered&quot;, the team placed mirrors underneath the bikes to shroud the wheels.

Although lacking the anti-gravity technology ascribed to speeder bikes, real-life hoverbikes utilize different principles of levitation with the goal of achieving a similar effect. Mark DeRoche of Aero-X maker Aerofex said it was &quot;a tribute to George Lucas&#x27; team&quot; that their prototype hoverbike – a low-altitude tandem duct aerial vehicle – resembled &quot;Star Wars&quot; speeders. The HoverSurf HoverBike has also been compared to &quot;Star Wars&quot; speeder bikes, though it achieves flight by the same methods as a traditional quadcopter. The Japanese manufacturer AERWINS Technologies introduced in 2022 the XTURISMO hoverbike, which was inspired by and has been compared to &quot;Star Wars&quot; speeder bikes.

Since their inception, speeder bikes have been included in several &quot;Star Wars&quot; product lines, including Lego models and Hasbro miniatures.

<doc id="630713" wikidata="Q588596" url="?curid=630713" title="Pole position">
<text>In a motorsports race, the pole position is usually the best and &quot;statistically the most advantageous&quot; starting position on the track. The pole position is usually earned by the driver with the best qualifying times in the trials before the race, although penalties may award it to the second fastest driver, as the pole position is statistically awarded to the driver starting in first position. The number-one qualifying driver is also referred to as the pole-sitter. The pole position starts the race &quot;at the front of the starting grid. This provides the driver in the pole position the privilege of starting ahead of all the other drivers&quot;.

Grid position is typically determined by a qualifying session before the race, where race participants compete to ascend to the number 1 grid slot, the driver, pilot, or rider having recorded fastest qualification time awarded the advantage of the number 1 grid slot (i.e., the pole-position) ahead of all other vehicles for the start of the race. Historically, the fastest qualifier was not necessarily the designated &quot;pole-sitter&quot;. Different sanctioning bodies in motor sport employ different qualifying formats in designating who starts from pole position. Often, a starting grid is derived either by current rank in the championship, or based on finishing position of a previous race. In particularly important events where multiple qualification attempts spanned several days, the qualification result was segmented or staggered, by which session a driver qualified, or by which particular day a driver set his qualification time, only drivers having qualified on the initial day were eligible for pole position. Some race promoters or sanctioning bodies invert their starting grid for the purpose of entertainment value (e.g., pack racing; to artificially stimulate passing), the slowest qualifier would be designated as pole-sitter.

In contrast to contemporary motorsport, where only a race participant is designated pole-sitter, before World War II, the pace car was designated as the official pole-sitter for the Indianapolis 500.

==Origin==

The term has its origins in horse racing, in which the fastest qualifying horse would be placed on the inside part of the course, next to the pole marking the start line for the race.

==Formula One==
Originally in Grand Prix racing, grid positions, including pole, were determined by lottery among the drivers. Before the inception of the Formula One World Championship, the first instance of grid positions being determined by qualifying times was at the 1933 Monaco Grand Prix. Since then, the FIA have introduced many different qualifying systems to Formula One. From the long-standing system of one session on each of Friday and Saturday, to the current knockout-style qualifying leaving 10 out of 20 drivers to battle for pole, there have been many changes to qualifying systems. Between 1996 and 2006, the FIA made 6 significant changes to the qualifying procedure, each with the intention of making the battle for pole more interesting to viewers at home.

Traditionally, pole was always occupied by the fastest driver due to low-fuel qualifying. The race-fuel qualifying era between 2003 and 2009 briefly changed this. Despite the changing formats, drivers attempting pole were required between 2003 and 2009 to do qualifying laps with the fuel they would use to start the race the next day. An underfuelled slower car and driver would therefore be able to take pole ahead of a better but heavier-fueled car. In this situation, pole was not always advantageous to have in the race as the under-fueled driver would have to pit for more fuel before their rivals. With the race refueling ban introduced, low-fuel qualifying returned and these strategy decisions are no longer in play.

Also, when Formula One enforced the 107% rule between 1996 and 2002, a driver&#x27;s pole time might affect slower cars also posting times for qualifying, as cars that could not get within 107% of the pole time were not allowed start the race unless the stewards decided otherwise. Since the reintroduction of the rule in 2011, this only applies to the quickest time in the first session of qualifying (Q1) and not the pole time.

:&quot;As of the &quot; 

===Pole position trophy===

From , the FIA awarded a trophy to the driver who won the most pole positions in a Formula One season. In 2018, the &quot;FIA Pole Trophy&quot; was discontinued and replaced with the &quot;Pirelli Pole Position Award&quot;, where the polesitter at each race as awarded a Pirelli wind tunnel tyre with the name of the polesitter and their time. A whole-season trophy was awarded in and , but discontinued from onwards.
(WC) indicates that the driver won the World Championship in the same season.

==IndyCar==
IndyCar uses four formats for qualifying: one for most oval tracks, one for Iowa Speedway, one for the Indianapolis 500, and another for road and street circuits. Oval qualifying is almost like the Indianapolis 500, with two laps, instead of four, averaged together with one attempt, although with just one session.

At Iowa, each car takes one qualifying lap, and the top six cars advance to the feature race for the pole position. Positions from 7th onward are assigned to their races, based on time, with cars in the odd-numbered finishing order starting in one race, and cars in the even-numbered finishing order starting in the second race. The finishing order for the odd-numbered race starts on the inside, starting in Row 6 (11th), and even-numbered race on the outside based on finishing position, again from Row 6 (12th), except for the top two in each race, which start in the inside and outside, respectively (Row 4 and 5) of the race for the pole position. The result of the feature race determines positions 1–10. All three races are 50 laps.

On road and street courses, cars are drawn randomly into two qualifying groups. After each group has one twenty-minute session, the top six cars from each group qualify for a second session. The cars that finished seventh or worse are lined up by their times, with the best of these times starting 13th. The twelve remaining cars run a 15-minute session, after which the top six cars move on to a final 10-minute session to determine positions one through six on the grid.

The Iowa format was instituted in 2012 with major modifications (times set based on open qualifying session in second practice, positions 11th and back in odd positions raced in the inside heat, positions 12th and back in even positions raced in the outside heat, and positions 1–10 raced for the pole, each heat 30 laps), and non-Iowa oval format in August 2010, while the Indianapolis format was in 2010. The road course format was installed for 2008. In prior seasons, oval qualifying ran for four laps, Indianapolis-style, from 2008, and previously two laps with the best lap used for qualification. Street and road circuits used a two-phase format similar to oval qualifying except that cars took one qualifying lap, then the top six advanced to the ten-minute session for the pole.

===Indianapolis 500===

The pole position for the Indianapolis 500 is determined on the first day (or first full round) of time trials. Cars run four consecutive laps (10 miles), and the total elapsed time on the four laps determines the positioning. The fastest car on the first day of time trials wins the pole position. Times recorded in earlier days (rounds) start ahead of subsequent days (rounds). A driver could record a time faster than that of the pole winner on a subsequent day; however, he will be required to line up behind the previous day(s)&#x27; qualifiers.

Starting in 2010, the first day is split into Q1 and Q2. At the end of Q1, positions 10–24 are set. The top nine cars will then have their times wiped out and advance to Q2 where cars will have 90 minutes to run for pole. If inclement weather causes officials to cancel Q2, positions 1–24 are set. If inclement weather in Q1 is early where Q2 is late (past 6 PM usually), drivers will have only one attempt in Q2.

==Grand Prix motorcycle racing==

Since , there has been one hour-long session on Saturday where the riders have an unlimited number of laps to record a fast lap time. Simply, the rider with the fastest lap gains pole position for the race.

In a new format was introduced whereby qualifying is conducted over two 15-minute sessions labelled Q1 and Q2. The fastest 10 riders over combined practice times advance automatically to Q2, while the rest of the field competes in Q1. At the conclusion of Q1 the fastest 2 riders progress to Q2 with a chance to further improve their grid position.

In a new format was introduced where the results of qualifying set the grid for a Saturday Sprint Race as well as the Sunday Grand Prix Race.

==NASCAR==
Before 2001, NASCAR used a two-day qualifying format in its national series. Before 2002 only one lap was run on oval tracks except short tracks and restrictor plate tracks. Until 2014, the pole position has been determined by a two-lap time trial (one lap on road courses) with the faster lap time used as the driver&#x27;s qualifying speed. In 2014, NASCAR used a knockout qualifying format for all races except the Daytona 500, non-points races, and the Truck Series&#x27; Eldora Dirt Derby: after a 25-minute session (on tracks longer than ; tracks shorter than 1.25 miles have a 30-minute session), the 24 fastest cars advance to a ten-minute session, with the top 12 advancing to a final five-minute session. Starting in 2003, if a driver&#x27;s team changed their car&#x27;s engine after the qualifying segment was over, the car would be relegated to the rear of the 43-car field. In the case of multiple teams changing engines on the same weekend after a qualifying segment (although this is a rare occurrence), qualifying times from that segment are used to determine the starting order for those cars.

In the Eldora Dirt Derby, practice runs are held, which determine the starting grids for five heat races of eight laps each. The top five fastest qualifiers started on pole for each heat, and the winner of the first heat is awarded the pole for the feature race.

==Superbike==
Superpole for Superbike is a timed event to establish starting positions for motorcycle racers in World Superbike races.

For 2023 a World Superbike weekend typically consists of: 
* Friday – Two Free Practice sessions.
* Saturday – Free Practice, Superpole, WorldSBK Race 1, WorldSSP300 Last Chance Race.
* Sunday – Warm-up, WorldSBK Superpole Race, World SSP Race, WorldSBK Race 2, WorldSSP300 Race
:: 1. The final results of the Superpole decide the grid for WorldSBK Race One and Sunday&#x27;s (sprint) Superpole Race.
:: 2. The top six finishers of the &quot;last chance race&quot; take the final six spots of the WorldSSP300 race starting grid.
:: 3. The grid for WorldSBK Race 2 will be determined from the first nine positions in the Superpole Race, and the grid from 10th onwards will be the positions from Saturday&#x27;s Superpole.

The format of Superpole depends on weather conditions:
*Dry Superpole: The race director declares a &#x27;dry&#x27; Superpole (referring to the weather conditions) then Superpole will consist of 3 laps of the circuit. Riders start one by one in reverse qualifying order. Grid position for the races will be determined by each rider&#x27;s fastest single lap time.
*Wet Superpole: If Superpole is declared &#x27;wet&#x27;, Superpole will consist of 50 minutes of timed laps, for all 15 riders together, during which a rider may complete up to 12 laps (including in and out laps). Grid position for the races will be determined by each rider&#x27;s fastest single lap time. For each lap over 12 laps completed, the rider&#x27;s best lap time will be cancelled.

To qualify for the race, riders must record a lap time no longer than 107% of the time recorded by the pole-position rider. Qualifying tires may be used.

==Radio-controlled racing==
In radio-controlled car racing, the term Top Qualifier (TQ) is used to determine the fastest qualifying driver, usually over a two-day, five/six rounds qualifying sessions, depending on the overall duration of the event. The result is determined by the best half of the driver&#x27;s performance. As the event bring in over 100 entrants, the fastest driver is guaranteed directly a place in front of the A-main final, the group that carries a chance of being the overall winner. The slower drivers are allocated a spot to compete in their groups to determine the overall positions.

<text>The HP-41C series are programmable, expandable, continuous memory handheld RPN calculators made by Hewlett-Packard from 1979 to 1990. The original model, HP-41C, was the first of its kind to offer alphanumeric display capabilities. Later came the HP-41CV and HP-41CX, offering more memory and functionality.

== The alphanumeric &quot;revolution&quot; ==

The alphanumeric LCD screen of the HP-41C revolutionized the way a pocket calculator could be used, providing user friendliness (for its time) and expandability (keyboard-unassigned functions could be spelled out alphabetically). By using an alphanumeric display, the calculator could tell the user what was going on: it could display error messages, such as showing (&quot;&lt;samp&gt;DATA ERROR&lt;/samp&gt;&quot;) upon attempting to divide by zero instead of simply displaying a blinking zero; it could also specifically prompt the user for arguments (&quot;&lt;samp&gt;ENTER RADIUS&lt;/samp&gt;&quot;) instead of just displaying a question mark.

Earlier calculators needed a key, or key combination, for every available function. The HP-67 had three shift keys (gold &quot;f&quot;, blue &quot;g&quot; and black &quot;h&quot; prefix keys); the competing Texas Instruments calculators had two ( and ) and close to 50 keys (the TI-59 had 45). Hewlett-Packard were constrained by their one byte only instruction format. The more flexible storage format for programs in the TI-59 allowed combining more keys into one instruction. The longest instruction required eleven keypresses, re-using the shift keys four times. The TI-59 also made use of the key followed by two digits to access another 40 different functions, but the user had to remember the codes for them. Clearly, a more convenient and flexible method of executing the calculator&#x27;s instructions was needed. The HP-41C had a relatively small keyboard, and only one shift key, but provided hundreds of functions. Every function that was not assigned to a key could be invoked through the key (pronounced &quot;EXEQTE&quot; — &quot;execute&quot;) and spelled out in full, e.g. FACT for the factorial function.

The calculator had a special user mode where the user could assign any function to any key if the default assignments provided by HP were not suited to a specific application. For this mode, the HP-41C came with blank keyboard templates; i.e. plastic covers with holes for the keys, so the user could annotate customized keys. Hewlett-Packard even sold a version of the calculator where hardly any keys had function names printed on them, meant for users who would be using the HP-41C for custom calculations only (thus not needing the standard key layout at all); this version of the calculator was colloquially known, within HP&#x27;s Corvallis calculator team, as a &quot;Blanknut&quot; (because the development code name for the HP-41C&#x27;s processor was known as the &quot;coconut&quot;).

Alphanumeric display also greatly eased editing programs, as functions were spelled out in full. Numeric-only calculators displayed programming steps as a list of numbers, each number generally mapped to a key on the keyboard, often via row and column coordinates. Encoding functions to the corresponding numeric codes, and vice versa, was left to the user, having to look up the function–code combinations in a reference guide. The busy programmer quickly learned most of the codes, but having to learn the codes intimidated the beginners. In addition to this, the user had to mentally keep function codes separate from numeric constants in the program listing.

The HP-41C displayed each character in a block consisting of 14 segments that could be turned on or off; a so-called fourteen segment display (similar to the much more common seven segment displays, which can be used to display digits only). The HP-41C used a liquid-crystal display instead of the ubiquitous LED displays of the era, to reduce power consumption.

While this allowed the display of uppercase letters, digits, and a few punctuation characters (the FOCAL character set), some designs needed to be twisted arbitrarily (e.g. to distinguish S from 5) and lowercase letters were unreadable (HP only provided display of lowercase letters a through e). HP&#x27;s competitor Sharp, when introducing the PC-1211, used a dot matrix of 5×7 dots and displayed the characters in principle as we see them today on computer screens (and, in fact, many LCD screens on various embedded systems); this was later used by HP with the HP-71B handheld computer.

== The HP-41CV and CX ==
Many users had used all four ports for memory expansion, leaving no room for other modules. HP designed the &quot;Quad Memory Module&quot; with four times the amount of memory, providing the maximum available memory and leaving three empty ports available. The HP-41CV (V being the Roman numeral for 5) included this memory module on the main board, thus providing five times the memory of the HP-41C, and four available slots.

The internal architecture prohibited the addition of more memory, so HP designed an extended memory module that could be seen as secondary storage. The data could not be access directly, but it was possible to transfer data to and from main memory. To the calculator (and the user), data located in the extended memory looked like files on a modern hard disk do for a PC (user).

The final HP-41 model, the HP-41CX, included extended memory, a built-in time module, and extended functions. It was introduced in 1983 and discontinued in 1990.

== Programming ==

The HP-41C is keystroke programmable meaning that it can remember and later execute sequences of keystrokes to solve particular problems of interest to the user. These keystroke programs, in addition to performing any operation normally available on the keyboard, can also make use of conditional and unconditional branching and looping instructions, allowing programs to perform repetitive operations and make decisions.

The HP-41C also supports indirect addressing (computed goto) with which it is possible to implement a Universal Turing machine and therefore the programming model of the HP-41C can be considered Turing complete. The combination of indirect addressing and gotos easily led to spaghetti code.

Program steps are numbered starting from 1, but this numbering has no intrinsic meaning and changes as new instructions are added or removed in the middle of a program. A special LBL instruction is used to create a label that is then referenced by the user to invoke the program, or by the program itself as target of a GTO (unconditional goto) or XEQ (execute) instruction.

=== Programming example ===
Here is a sample program that computes the factorial of an integer between 1 and 69 (70! needing an exponent greater than 99, the calculator&#x27;s maximum). The integer is entered in the X register and passed as an input parameter when the program is run. The program takes up two registers, which is ≈14 bytes.

 Step Op-code Comment

 01 LBL&#x27;Fac ALPHA global label makes program callable by &#x27;XEQ Fac&#x27;
 02 STO 00 Store X=input parameter in register 00
 03 1 Enter 1 in X, &quot;lifting&quot;, or &quot;pushing&quot;, the stack: Y=input parameter (no longer used)
 X=1
 04 LBL 00 Local label for goto
 05 RCL 00 Recall register 00 into X, lifting the stack: Z=input parameter (no longer used)
 Y=1 or interim or final factorial
 X=input parameter (N) minus effect of DSE command (-0, -1, ..., -(N-1))
 06 * Multiply X and Y, &quot;dropping&quot;, or &quot;popping&quot;, the stack: Y=input parameter (no longer used)
 X=interim or final factorial
 07 DSE 00 Decrement register 00 and Skip next command when register value is Equal to 0
 08 GTO 00 Go to local label 00
 09 END End program - result displayed in X

=== FOCAL ===

Though the programming language used on the 41 series is a version of the keystroke programming languages used in all preceding programmable HP calculators, the range of technologies, and programming-related usability and extensibility features available in 41 series models (notably keyboard overlays, a fully remappable keyboard, I/O capabilities for storing and sharing programs, and alphanumeric support), led some users to propose a new name for the language, resulting in a competition that was won by &quot;FOCAL&quot; for &quot;Forty One Calculator Language&quot;. As the name FOCAL was already in use by the Digital Equipment Corporation, the name was never formally adopted by HP.

== Synthetic programming ==
A large user community was built around the HP-41C. Enthusiasts around the world found new ways of programming, created their own software (such as a codebreaking game, and a version of &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot;) and expansion modules, and sped up the clock (see overclocking). Most of these activities were coordinated by the PPC club and its president, Richard J. Nelson. The PPC club published the PPC Journal and produced the PPC ROM, a collection of highly optimized low-level programs for the HP-41C.

One of the discoveries of the community was that, because some FOCAL instructions were stored in memory as more than one byte, it is possible to exploit a bug in the program editor to assign strange functions to keys. The most important function was known as the byte jumper or byte grabber, a way to step partially through programming instructions and edit them in ways that were not otherwise allowed. The use of the resulting instructions was called &quot;synthetic programming&quot;.

Through synthetic instructions, a user could access memory and special status flags reserved for the operating system, and do very strange things, including completely locking the machine. It was possible to create sounds or display characters, and create animations not officially supported by the operating system. The system flags were also accessed as low-level shortcuts to Boolean programming techniques. Hewlett-Packard did not officially support synthetic programming, but neither did it do anything to prevent it, and eventually even provided internal documentation to the user groups.

== Reception ==
In its December 1980 issue, &quot;BYTE&quot; magazine described the HP-41C as &quot;the most versatile machine ever&quot;. The author praised HP&#x27;s documentation as &quot;among the best in the industry&quot;, and reported that the calculator was &quot;&quot;much&quot; easier to program and debug&quot; than the TI-59. Stating &quot;I found the HP-41C far more pleasurable to program and use than its predecessors&quot; because of its alphanumeric display, the author concluded that it was &quot;maybe not quite&quot; a pocket computer. In the next issue, another author wrote that &quot;The HP-41C ... is among the programmable calculators that lie closest to the computer borderline. It comes close enough for the jargon of computers to be useful in describing it&quot;, and praised the simplicity and reliability of the card reader and compatibility with HP-67 and HP-97 software. The review criticized the inaccuracies in calculations from the lack of guard digits; &quot;There is something absurd about the world&#x27;s fanciest calculator not being able to give results accurate to more than seven or eight decimal places&quot;. Hewlett-Packard responded that the alleged imprecision was inherent to arithmetic on any computer with finite precision.

== Use on the Space Shuttle ==
An HP-41C that flew on nine early Space Shuttle missions is on display in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. HP-41Cs with some special hardware configurations (the addition of Velcro strips, pre-production time module, and louder beeper, as well as the removal of parts whose outgassing could cause contamination) were carried on early Shuttle missions for the purpose of performing mundane but necessary calculations, such as calculating the change to the center of gravity due to fuel consumption. The HP-41C was also programmed to handle calculations usually performed by the main on-board computer, such as determining ignition times for re-entry, in the case of a main computer failure.

== Expandability ==
The functions of the calculator could be expanded by adding modules at the top of the machine. Four slots were available to add more memory, pre-programmed solution packs containing programs covering engineering, surveying, physics, math, finance, games, etc. As such, an HP-41 could in fact be tailored to the personal needs of the user. Hardware extensions included a thermal printer, a magnetic card reader (HP-67 compatible via converter software), and a barcode &quot;wand&quot; (reader).

Extension modules could also add new instructions to the machine. The standard set of mathematical functions of the 41-series was somewhat limited when compared to the functionality of some contemporary HP calculators (notably the HP-34C and the HP-15C). Among others, the standard function set offered no integration or root-finding capabilities and lacked support for matrices and complex numbers; these extra functions could be added by an extension module.

Another module, known as the Interface Loop allowed for connection of more peripherals: larger printers, microcassette tape recorders, 3-inch floppy disk drives, RS-232 communication interfaces, video display interfaces, etc. The Interface Loop could also be used with the HP-71B, HP-75 and HP-110 computers.
HP-41 extension (or expansion) modules allowed the user of an HP-41 programmable calculator to extend the functionality of the machine. The HP-41 had room for up to four expansion modules at the back of calculator.

The HP-41 was not the only calculator of its generation that allowed expansion modules. The TI-58 and TI-59 also had pluggable ROM modules. The HP-41 modules were however much more versatile.

=== Memory modules (HP-41C only) ===

Memory modules added RAM main memory to the calculator, allowing more programming steps and/or more data registers.

The original HP-41C had a main memory of 63 registers of 7 bytes each. Each register could hold either a number, a 6-character string, or up to seven program steps in the FOCAL language (program steps used a variable number of bytes).

Each memory module added 64 registers, and the calculator could hold up to four of them, for a grand total of 319 registers. While this was considered huge for the time (a little more than 2 kilobytes,) all expansion slots were used. User groups found a way to merge two memory chips in a single module, thus freeing two expansion slots. HP designed a module holding all four in one slot, the so-called &quot;Quad Memory Module&quot;. The later HP-41CV had the quad module built-in.

=== Application pacs ===
The ROM-based application &#x27;pac&#x27; modules added up to 4 kilobytes of read-only memory (some up to 8 kilobytes, but these were simply two independent 4K modules in the same box). Most modules held dozens of programs written in the HP-41C programming language, FOCAL.

Programs in the ROM modules could be called from a user program, using the ubiquitous XEQ function. In the program code, XEQ appeared as &quot;codice_1&quot; when it was used to call a ROM program.

=== 82104A card reader ===
The card reader was a device able to read and write small rectangular plastic cards with two magnetic strips. The card reader could copy contents of memory onto magnetic cards, and later read back the data into memory.

As the HP-41C had non-volatile memory (user programs and data were not wiped out when power was off) there was no absolute need for a permanent storage device, so the card reader was optional.

Each card held two strips of 112 bytes each, that could hold 16 data registers or up to 112 program steps. This limited capacity resulted in typical programs requiring five or more magnetic cards to be saved. A full backup of the machine&#x27;s 319 memory registers plus internal data required 11 magnetic cards (each card had to be inserted twice.)

The card reader could read magnetic cards from the earlier model HP-67. HP-67 programs were translated into HP-41C instructions, as the HP-67 and HP-41 share the same programming model and operation stack. Some instructions however were specific to the HP-67, and the card reader provided additional instructions to emulate the 67.

Magnetic cards could be write-protected, and programs saved as private: once loaded back, the source code for the program could not be displayed. This made magnetic cards an obvious choice for program distribution.

However, the electric motor put a heavy strain on the calculator batteries, and the price tag for blank cards put an even heavier strain on the user&#x27;s wallet.

=== 82182A time module ===
The time module added a real-time clock. The clock allowed use of real-world time in programs. The user could set alarms that triggered calls to user programs. The alarms were able to switch the calculator on, so it was possible to create programs that executed at some point during the day, then switch the calculator off until the next alarm. As the HP-41 was often used as a data-gathering device in labs, this allowed the calculator to read data from monitored devices at specific times every day, without having to remain fully powered up in between readings (thus saving battery capacity).

The HP-41CX had the time module built in.

=== 82143A thermal printer/plotter ===
The printer used rolls of thermal paper to print lines of up to 24 characters. The thermal paper provided for a bluish printout, but was somewhat unstable, as the printout could vanish or the whole paper turn blue due to excessive heat.

The printer had some graphical capabilities, to allow the user to design character shapes, or even turn on or off individual pixels. However, the buffer memory could not hold sufficient information to print a whole line in graphic mode, and could not alter line spacing, so it was impossible to print continuous graphics in horizontal mode. The printer, nevertheless, provided some printing utilities that were able to graph a function vertically onto the narrow strip of printer paper.

=== 82242A infrared printer interface ===
Instead of using the aforementioned printer, this module could be used to interface a thermal printer with an infrared interface, namely the HP 82240A and the HP 82240B. This allows for on-the-go printing without using cables - but the printer itself needs batteries as well.

=== 82153A optical wand ===

The optical wand was a barcode reader shaped like a thick pen, and was designed to read lines of HP-proprietary standard barcodes into the calculator memory. The barcodes, printed in e.g. HP solutions books, could consist of programs, numeric or alphabetical constants, and even keypresses (letting the calculator be operated without using the keyboard) — useful for diagnosing calculators where the keyboard was suspected to be faulty.

=== 82180A extended functions module ===
The Extended Functions module added many functions which had long been requested by users, such as the ability to programmatically assign functions to keys, repartition memory, etc.

But the most important new function was the management of extended memory: while the HP-41C could theoretically access up
to 1024 registers, the early design limited main memory to 319 registers only. The Extended Functions module added instructions to manage a bank of additional memory in the available addressing space of the machine. As this memory was not directly
addressable by user programs, it was seen as a set of named files containing either programs or data. Programs and data registers could
be copied back and forth from the extended memory to the main memory, where they could be accessed as usual.

Extended memory could also hold ASCII files, and a rudimentary text editor was added also.

The Extended Functions module contained 124 registers of Extended memory. More could be added by ... Extended Memory modules.
The HP-41CX contained the Extended Functions module as standard.

=== 82181A extended memory module ===

Extended memory modules added more extended memory to the HP-41C. They required an extended functions module to be present, or the HP-41CX version of the calculator.

Each module added 238 registers of extended memory. Up to two extended memory modules could be inserted, for a grand total of 124 + 2*238 = 600 registers. Added to the 319 registers of main memory, this covered practically all of the machine&#x27;s 1024 addressable registers, for a total of 919 registers, or 6433 bytes.

=== HP82160A HP interface loop (HP-IL) module ===
&quot;See the main article on HP-IL.&quot;

== Clones ==
=== DM41 et al. ===
The continued popularity of the HP-41CX among users prompted SwissMicros to produce a miniature calculator approximating the size of an ID-1 credit card (88 mm × 59 mm × 7 mm) in 2015. Named &quot;DM41&quot;, it runs the original HP-41CX firmware with extended memory and realtime clock in an emulator on an ARM Cortex-M0-based NXP LPC1115 processor. Deviating from the original, it comes in a landscape form factor (as known from Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s Voyager series) with rearranged keys, it features a dot-matrix display, switchable clock speeds, and, based on a Silicon Labs CP2102 converter chip, it comes with a USB (Mini-B) serial interface to exchange data with a PC etc. for backup purposes, to possibly communicate with applications (like PC-based emulators), or to update the firmware. In December 2015, SwissMicros introduced the &quot;DM41L&quot;, a version of the calculator about the same size as the calculators of the HP Voyager series. It still comes with a USB Mini-B connector. Since September 2020, its successor, the &quot;DM41X&quot;, has also been offered with an extended range of functions and a conventional design that is very close to the classic original version.

=== HP41CL ===
In addition to clones based on emulated HP-41 hardware, there exists at least one actual hardware clone of the HP-41 series. This is the HP41CL HP-41-series CPU board upgrade created by Monte Dalrymple at Systemyde. The HP41CL is a ground up redesign of the components found on the HP-41 CPU board, including the CPU, which is implemented on an FPGA and coded in Verilog RTL. The HP41CL upgrade board is made as a drop-in replacement for the HP-41 series CPU board, assuming that one has an HP-41 that has a compatible CPU board connector and a separate CPU board as well. The upgrade comes with an over 600 register extended memory and over 320 plug-in module images. This is possible due to the fact that the HP41CL has over 1024 pages of 4K-word flash memory built in, of which over 500 pages are pre-loaded with HP-41 software, as well as the upgrade board providing 128 RAM pages, which are made available to the user via a custom MMU. In addition, a &quot;turbo&quot; mode is provided by the HP41CL upgrade board&#x27;s &quot;NEWT&quot; CPU design, which allows the user to speed up their calculator by a factor of around 50 times. Also, the HP41CL maintains full compatibility with the HP-41 series bus, so that most plug-in modules can still be used in a fully backward compatible fashion. Additionally, Systemyde makes an HP-41 compatible timer module clone as well as a GPS receiver interface module. Furthermore, an optional RS-232 full-duplex serial connector (with a 2.5mm stereo jack physical interface) is available, if one has a free module slot.

== Emulators ==

Unusually for pocket calculators, the devices still have a fan base more than 30 years after their production was discontinued in 1989. As a result, emulator programs are available for a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, Unix variants, Pocket PC, Palm OS, Apple iOS and Android.

<text>Abiathar Crescas (, ) was a 15th-century physician and astrologer from the Crown of Aragon (now part of Spain). He was head astrologer to King John II of Aragon, father of King Ferdinand of Aragon.

He could remove cataracts by a surgical procedure known as couching. In 1468 he restored the eyesight of King John in two simple operations, who was completely blind before the surgeries.

Crescas was a leader of Aragon&#x27;s Jewish community.

<text>Antonio Chacón (1869–1929) was a Spanish flamenco singer [cantaor].

Chacón was born in Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz Province. He began earning a living by performing flamenco around 1884. He toured Andalucia with his two friends, the Molina brothers - dancer Antonio Molina, and guitarist Javier Molina. He was later hired by Silverio Franconetti for his café in Seville. He was noted for his skill in singing the cartagenera, malagueñas, granaína and media granaína, which earned him the popular title of &quot;Don&quot;.

According to Fernando el de Triana, he was so accomplished that all of the most successful &quot;cantaores&quot; (singers) performing with him renounced their right of seniority and allowed Chacón to perform last, because the audience would simply leave when he finished. Had they not preceded him, they would have been performing to an empty hall.

He performed with many of the best performers of his era. The great guitarist Ramón Montoya performed as Chacón&#x27;s accompanist for over a decade until the early 1920s. Another great guitarist, Sabicas, then accompanied him, early in the latter&#x27;s career.

In 1922 at Granada he participated in the celebrated Concurso de Cante Jondo. Chacón was given the place of honor, presiding over the judges of this flamenco contest. For many the singer Chacón remains &quot;el mejor de todos los tiempos&quot; (the best of all time). He died in Madrid.

<doc id="630720" wikidata="Q894567" url="?curid=630720" title="Boston Garden">
<text>The Boston Garden was an arena in Boston, Massachusetts. Designed by boxing promoter Tex Rickard, who also built the third iteration of New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, it opened on November 17, 1928, as &quot;Boston Madison Square Garden&quot; (later shortened to just &quot;Boston Garden&quot;) and outlived its original namesake by 30 years. It was above North Station, a train station which was originally a hub for the Boston and Maine Railroad and is now a hub for MBTA Commuter Rail and Amtrak trains.

The Garden hosted home games for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA), as well as rock concerts, amateur sports, boxing and professional wrestling matches, circuses, and ice shows. It was also used as an exposition hall for political rallies such as the speech by John F. Kennedy in November 1960. Boston Garden was demolished in 1998, three years after the completion of its successor arena, TD Garden.

==Design==
Rickard built the arena specifically with boxing in mind, believing every seat should be close enough to see the &quot;sweat on the boxers&#x27; brows&quot;. Because of this design theme, fans were much closer to the players during Bruins and Celtics games than in most arenas, leading to a distinct hometown advantage. This physical proximity also created spectacular acoustic effects, much like the Chicago Stadium.

Due to the success of the Celtics in the 1980s, the Boston Garden was one of the most difficult buildings for visiting NBA teams. During the season, the Celtics were 40–1 at home, setting the NBA record for home court mastery (the San Antonio Spurs tied the record 30 years later in the season). They also finished the post-season undefeated at home. Combined with the following regular season, the Celtics&#x27; Garden record was 79–3 between the 1985–86 and regular seasons.

While the parquet floor was an important part of the history of the Celtics, it was not originally part of the Garden. The parquet floor was built and installed in the Boston Arena (first home of the Bruins hockey team) and moved to the Garden in 1952. It is said the Celtics knew which way the basketball would bounce off any section of the floor; this was one contributing factor to the Celtics&#x27; many NBA championships. The floor became as much a part of Boston sports lore as the Green Monster of Fenway Park. The parquet floor was used at the FleetCenter until December 22, 1999. Portions of the original floor are integrated with new parquet.

The floor was cut into small pieces and sold as souvenirs along with seats and bricks. The Naden/Day Industries overhead scoreboard (which was electro-mechanical, not electronic, as more recent arenas used) hung in the Boston Garden-themed food court of the Arsenal Mall in Watertown until 2018, when the mall began to undergo renovations. The Celtics&#x27; old championship banners and retired numbers now hang at the team&#x27;s now-former practice facility in Waltham; a new set of banners were made for the move to the FleetCenter (now TD Garden). The Celtics used to raise Eastern Division championship banners at Boston Garden in the 1960s, but stopped this practice by the 1970s. Likewise, the Bruins made a new set of banners when they moved to the FleetCenter, which were again replaced after the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals with six new banners, each using the contemporary logo of the Bruins when each Cup victory occurred. The Bruins also raised numerous Adams Division, Presidents&#x27; Trophy and Wales Conference championship banners at the old Garden, but due to lack of space, they consolidated them into one single banner each upon moving to TD Garden.
===Flaws===
The Garden&#x27;s hockey rink was undersized at , some nine feet shorter and two feet narrower than standard (), due to the rink being built at a time when the NHL did not have a standard size for rinks. This size matched the size of the Boston Arena ice surface, the original home of the Bruins. When the Bruins moved in as tenant, the Boston Arena had had a ice surface; this was reduced so as to add more seats. The Boston Arena, later renamed the Matthews Arena, modified its ice surface in 1995 to the standard-length rink, still in use in the 21st century for college hockey. Visiting players were frequently thrown off their games by the differing setup of the players&#x27; benches being on opposing sides of the ice, as well as the non-standard penalty box locations. This also was the setup in the Boston Arena. This setup, still occasionally seen in college hockey, was done to ensure that each team could have a bench connected to their dressing room. Towards the end of the Garden&#x27;s life as an arena, the NHL required all rinks to have both benches on the same side: the Garden obliged by moving the penalty boxes (formerly adjacent to the Bruins&#x27; bench) to the side vacated by the visitor&#x27;s bench, and as such visiting teams were required to skate across the ice to head back to their rooms.

The Garden&#x27;s earlier Bulova-crafted &quot;Sports Timer&quot; game clock system using the typical analog dial-type game clock design of that era, said to have been installed at the Garden early in the 1940s, and essentially identical in appearance and function to the one used in the Chicago Stadium until September 1975, was removed and replaced by an all-digital-display unit created by the Day Sign Company of Toronto in time for the 1970 Stanley Cup playoffs, and remained in use until the Garden&#x27;s closure.

The Garden had no air conditioning, resulting in fog forming over the ice during some Bruins&#x27; playoff games. During Game 5 of the 1984 NBA Finals, the heat in the facility was so intense that oxygen tanks were provided to exhausted Lakers players.

The Bruins&#x27; Stanley Cup finals appearances in 1988 and 1990 were both disrupted by power outages. On May 24, 1988, a 1930s vintage 4160V switchgear failed and the emergency generator did not start during game four of the Finals between the Bruins and the Edmonton Oilers, causing the game to be suspended; game four was replayed in its entirety in Edmonton two days later. Two years later, on May 15, 1990, the lights went out during an overtime finals game between the same two teams. However, the lights were on an automatic timer and could be turned back on this time with the game ending with a 3–2 triple overtime win for the visiting Oilers.

==History==

===Founding===
Tex Rickard, the noted entrepreneur and boxing promoter who built and operated the third Madison Square Garden, sought to expand his empire by building seven &quot;Madison Square Gardens&quot; around the country. On November 15, 1927, Homer Loring, chairman of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, announced that plans had been finalized for the construction of a new North Station facility, which would include a sports arena. A group led by Rickard, John S. Hammond, and William F. Carey of the Madison Square Garden Corporation, as well as Boston businessmen Charles F. Adams and Huntington Hardwick, signed a 25-year lease for the arena. Sheldon Fairbanks was chosen to be the arena&#x27;s first general manager. Boston &amp; Maine shareholder Edmund D. Codman challenged the legality of the railroad constructing a non-railroad building. The Massachusetts General Court passed legislation expanding the corporate powers of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad which was signed by Governor Alvan T. Fuller on March 6, 1928. Codman&#x27;s Bill in equity was dismissed by Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice John Crawford Crosby in October 1928. Built at a cost of $10 million – over double the cost for New York&#x27;s arena three years earlier – Boston Garden turned out to be the last of Rickard&#x27;s proposed series, a decision fueled by rising costs and Rickard&#x27;s untimely death in early 1929 due to a ruptured appendix, the arena was only 2 months old when Rickard died.

The Garden&#x27;s first event was on November 17, 1928, a boxing card headlined by Boston Native &quot;Honey Boy&quot; Dick Finnegan&#x27;s defeat of Andre Routis. The first team sporting event was held three days later, an ice hockey game between the Bruins and the archrival Montreal Canadiens, won by the Canadiens 1–0. The game was attended by 17,000 fans, 2,000 over capacity, as fans without tickets stormed their way in. The game started 25 minutes late. Windows and doors were broken by the fans in the action. The first non-sporting event, a conclave featuring evangelist Rodney &quot;Gipsy&quot; Smith, was held on March 24, 1929.

===Early years===
The Boston Garden was originally owned by the Boston and Maine Corporation and controlled by Rickard and the Madison Square Garden.

During the early years of the Boston Garden, the building&#x27;s main draws were boxing, wrestling, and Bruins hockey. Johnny Indrisano, Lou Brouillard, Ernie Schaaf, Al Mello, and Jack Sharkey were among the boxers who fought at the Boston Garden. Wrestling became big due to the popularity of Gus Sonnenberg. Sonnenberg defeated Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis at the Garden in 1929 in a fight that set an attendance record for a wrestling match (19,500) and drew a record gate ($77,000). Paul Bowser promoted wrestling in Boston at this time and when the sport began to lose popularity, he brought Danno O&#x27;Mahony from Ireland to Boston. O&#x27;Mahony became a popular draw at the Garden.

In 1930, construction on the Hotel Manger, a 500-room hotel connected to the Boston Garden through an elevated skyway, was completed. The hotel (later known as the Hotel Madison) closed in 1976 and was demolished in 1983.

Under the leadership of manager Dick Dunn, the Boston Garden booked a wide variety of events, including an Aimee Semple McPherson revival, a welterweight championship bout between Young Jack Thompson and Lou Brouillard, New England&#x27;s first rodeo event, and a Reinald Werrenrath concert. Dunn was able to bring the Garden from a deficit to a $200,000 profit in his first year as manager.

The Boston Garden also promoted events at Rockingham Park in Salem, New Hampshire, including the New England States Fair, automobile races, and Grand Circuit harness racing stakes races.

In 1933, the Boston Athletic Association Indoor Games moved from the Boston Arena to the larger Garden. The games remained at the Garden until they ended in 1971.

The Garden suffered economically during the Great Depression. Boxing was at a low point in Boston, as fighters chose to work in other cities, wrestling attendance was down, and hockey attendance waned after Ace Bailey suffered a severe head injury at the hands of Bruin Eddie Shore in 1933. In 1934, the Madison Square Garden Corporation sold its interest in the Boston Garden to the Boston Arena Corporation, led by Henry G. Lapham. This resulted in the creation of the Boston Garden-Arena Corporation. George V. Brown served as general manager of the Garden under the Boston Garden-Arena Corporation until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by his son, Walter A. Brown.

During the Depression, Sonja Henie&#x27;s Hollywood Ice Revue and the Ice Follies were successful draws and kept the Garden afloat. In 1939, a financial dispute between Henie and her managers led Walter Brown and eight other arena managers to found the Ice Capades.

==Notable events==

===Music===

Rudy Vallée and his orchestra performed at the Garden on April 21, 1932. Vallée returned to the Garden on October 23–24, 1938 for a &quot;battle of the bands&quot; with Benny Goodman that drew 25,000.

The first rock concert held at the Garden was on November 30, 1956, when the building hosted Alan Freed&#x27;s &quot;Biggest Show of 1956&quot;.

The Beatles played a show at the Garden during their first US/Canada tour on September 12, 1964, staying at the then-attached Hotel Madison.

James Brown played a notable show at the Garden on April 5, 1968, the night after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Only 2,000 attended the sold-out show, because the mayor, Kevin White, and community leaders had encouraged people to obtain refunds on their tickets and instead to watch a hastily arranged television broadcast of the concert on the local public station WGBH-TV. Mayor White appeared on stage, asking the Garden audience and the city to peacefully remember King, and James Brown&#x27;s words and presence was credited with helping to keep the peace in Boston. WGBH rebroadcast the concert twice that night, an action which helped keep people off of the street at a time other major cities were erupting in riots. The performance was released on DVD as &quot;Live at the Boston Garden: April 5, 1968&quot;.

Elvis Presley performed in Boston only once, at the Garden on November 10, 1971, pulling a full crowd of about 16,500 and receiving high praise from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Jon Landau for his performance.

In 1972, The Rolling Stones were scheduled to perform at the Garden when two members were detained by Rhode Island police. Fearful that angry Stones fans (already in the Garden awaiting the show) would riot, mayor Kevin H. White intervened with the Rhode Island authorities and secured the musicians&#x27; release so they could play their set in Boston. The band had also played at the venue in 1965 and 1969 and would again in 1975.

In 1973, The Who was scheduled to perform at the Garden and nearly didn&#x27;t perform due to the band being detained by police after destroying a hotel room in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where they&#x27;d appeared the previous evening. The band was eventually released from jail and managed to arrive at the Garden in time for their show and took out their frustrations for being arrested the night before by delivering a blistering set and taunting the Montreal police, dedicating their performance of &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; to them. Who drummer Keith Moon (for the rest of the &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; tour) changed one of the lyrics to the song &quot;Bell Boy&quot; from &quot;remember the gaff where the doors we smashed&quot; to &quot;remember Montreal at the hotel we trashed&quot; or variations of the band being arrested. Almost three years later in March 1976, Moon collapsed at his drum kit during the second song &quot;Substitute&quot; after downing muscle relaxers and brandy before the show. The band had to reschedule the performance for early April and the rescheduled performance turned out to be one of The Who&#x27;s best performances of the 1976 tour.

The Who&#x27;s last performance at the Garden was in December 1979 on their first tour following Moon&#x27;s death. That performance was almost canceled after several fans at a Who show in Cincinnati died while trying to get in early for a general admission show. The Boston City Council held a televised hearing on whether to allow the show to go forward and decided to permit it because there was no general admission seating in Boston. The show was marred by a fan throwing a firecracker on stage, causing Pete Townshend to scream obscenities in the general direction of the source before getting on with the tension-filled show.

In 1975, Led Zeppelin was banned from performing at the Boston Garden after concert fans were allowed in the lobby due to sub-freezing temperatures while waiting for tickets to go on sale for the band&#x27;s show. Turning on the generosity of their hosts, some of the fans rioted, broke into the Garden and trashed the seating area, the ice, and most of the refreshment stands, leading then-mayor White to cancel the upcoming show and ban the group for five years.

In 1976, KISS was banned from performing at the Garden because the band refused to comply with the venue&#x27;s no pyrotechnic policy after fire marshals had watched their flamethrowers hit the ceiling at the Orpheum.

Pink Floyd was the first band to perform at the Boston Garden with a stage set that cost over $1 million on their 1977 &quot;Animals&quot; tour (they first played there in 1975 on the band&#x27;s &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; tour). According to Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason&#x27;s book &quot;Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd&quot;, Pink Floyd almost got banned from the Boston Garden after their 1977 performances because the band, unknown to the venue&#x27;s owners, used pyrotechnics during their performance (the exploding pig for &quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot; and firework displays on &quot;Sheep&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;). However, the band&#x27;s road crew outsmarted the fire marshals by removing the pyro props quickly after they used them in the shows to prevent the band from being banned and also according to Mason&#x27;s book since their manager had an Irish name (Steve O&#x27;Rourke), the band escaped being arrested. The band decided not to play at the venue again, instead opting for the Providence Civic Center and Foxboro Stadium on their 1987/1988 and 1994 tours, respectively.

Grateful Dead performed at the Boston Garden more times than any other band, with 24 performances from 1973 to 1994 (as an opener or middle of bill or headliner), and were intended to be the last band to play the Garden, with six shows scheduled for September 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19, 1995, which were canceled due to the death of Jerry Garcia on August 9, 1995. The ticket for the 19th stated &quot;we’re gonna tear this old building down&quot; referencing the song &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. The Dead did not play at the Garden for a number of years following an incident in which they were caught grilling lobsters on a fire escape before a performance. The Grateful Dead have released &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks Volume 12&quot; and &quot;17&quot; culled from performances at the Garden on June 28, 1974, and September 25, 1991.

Detroit rocker Bob Seger recorded a bulk of his 1981 double live album &quot;Nine Tonight&quot; at The Boston Garden in October 1980. Five years before, The J. Geils Band recorded most of their November 1975 show at The Boston Garden for their 1976 double live album &quot;Blow Your Face Out&quot;. The Geils band returned again, and had the historical distinction of being the first band in history to sell out a three-night stand in 1982 at the Garden featuring hometown favorites Jon Butcher Axis as opening act.

Hometown band Aerosmith performed at the Boston Garden ten times from 1975 to 1995 and twice played New Year&#x27;s shows there, ringing in the 1990 and 1994 New Years.

Other acts that performed at the Garden include Pavarotti, Frank Sinatra, Liberace, Duke Ellington, Judy Garland, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops, U2, Bruce Springsteen, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Nine Inch Nails, Tom Petty, Grace Slick with Jefferson Airplane, Jethro Tull (who had 15 headlining performances there between 1971 and 1980 which is the most for a band, their last being on 1980&#x27;s A Tour before switching to the Worcester Centrum in 1982), Bob Dylan with The Band, Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, The Jackson 5, Queen, Rush, Styx and George Burns and Gracie Allen among others.

The opening of the Worcester Centrum and the Great Woods Amphitheater caused a massive drop in concerts at the Garden from the early 1980s until the early 1990s. The age of glam metal practically passed the Garden by completely, as most bands from that era played the Centrum in the winter and Great Woods in the summer. Poor acoustics, a busy sports schedule, expensive booking fees, and difficulty with local unions all contributed to the migration to more modern venues outside of Boston.

Under new Garden President Larry Moulter, bands started returning to the Garden in the late 1980s and early 1990s, highlighted by Pearl Jam&#x27;s multi-night stand in 1994, and the Dead&#x27;s lengthy residences there before the Garden finally closed. The final New Year&#x27;s Eve show at the Boston Garden was performed by the Vermont band Phish on December 31, 1994. On that night, the band rode a giant hot dog float above the audience; the hot dog is now in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.

===Sports===
The facility hosted games in the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and Stanley Cup Finals where the Bruins won two of their championships at the Garden in 1939 and 1970. The 1929 Stanley Cup championship was won at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden (III). The 1941 Stanley Cup championship was won at Detroit&#x27;s Olympia Stadium. The 1972 Stanley Cup championship was won at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. The Montreal Canadiens claimed the Stanley Cup at the Garden in 1958, 1977 and 1978, while the Detroit Red Wings won the cup there in 1943. In 1990, the Edmonton Oilers claimed their fifth Stanley Cup at the Garden. The 1932 series did not involve the Bruins; Game 2 between the Toronto Maple Leafs and New York Rangers was played there due to a scheduling conflict at MSG III. The New England Whalers played playoff games at the Garden prior to moving from Boston, which included the 1973 Avco Cup Final, where the Whalers beat the Winnipeg Jets in Game 5 by a score of 9-6 to win their only WHA championship.

The facility has also hosted games in the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and 1987 NBA Finals, in which the Celtics won nine of their championships on home court in 1957, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1984, and 1986. The only visitor to claim the NBA championship at the Garden were the Los Angeles Lakers, who won the 1985 Finals.

In addition to championship rounds, the Garden also hosted the NBA All-Star Game in 1951, 1952, 1957, and 1964, and the NHL All-Star Game in 1971. The NCAA Frozen Four was contested there from 1972 to 1974. Starting in 1955, the Beanpot tournament, featuring the four major college hockey programs in the Boston area, was held at the Garden annually on the first week of February.

Boston Garden was the first arena to host the Stanley Cup Finals and NBA Finals at the same time in 1957. It occurred again in 1958 and 1974.

The Boston Garden was a frequent host of Vince McMahon&#x27;s WWF for many years throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in the form of wrestling &quot;house shows&quot; (non-televised matches), and superstars like Hulk Hogan, André the Giant, Randy &quot;Macho Man&quot; Savage, Tito Santana, Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat and many others would regularly appear there. But despite this relationship, the Boston Garden was host to only one pro wrestling pay-per-view in its history: the 1993 Survivor Series. The WWF held their final house show in the Boston Garden on May 13, 1995.

===Rallies and speeches===
The Boston Garden hosted many religious conclaves. Evangelists who appeared at the Garden include Aimee McPherson (1931), Billy Graham (1950) Bishop Fulton J. Sheen (1953), and Jimmy Swaggart (July 29–31, 1983).
The Garden was also the site of a number of political rallies. 20,000 people attended a 55th birthday celebration for President Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 29, 1937. FDR also drew another 20,000 for a political rally 1940. On May 2, 1943, the night after the Hollywood Victory Caravan came through town, a Jewish anti-Nazi rally was held at the Garden. The United War Fund hosted a rally headlined by Jimmy Durante, Greer Garson, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The day before the 1960 presidential election, a rally for John F. Kennedy drew 20,000 while police estimated that there were another 100,000 people in the streets outside the Garden. Other politicians to hold rallies at the Garden include presidential candidates Thomas Dewey and Dwight D. Eisenhower and former Boston mayor and Massachusetts governor James Michael Curley.

Former Irish Prime Minister and President Éamon de Valera spoke at the Garden On March 24, 1948 (Easter Sunday). British Prime Minister Winston Churchill spoke there March 31, 1949 as part of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Convocation.

==Final years==
By the early 1970s, Boston Garden was deteriorating. The building had no air conditioning and some seats were obstructed by structural pillars. The seats were decades old and terribly cramped. With a capacity of less than 15,000, it was one of the country&#x27;s smallest major league sports arenas. The Garden also lacked luxury suites, which had become an important and much-needed source of revenue for teams in professional sports. In 1972, Boston Mayor Kevin White announced plans for a new 18,000-seat arena to be built near South Station. Plans for the arena fell through when Storer Broadcasting, then-owner of the Boston Garden and the Bruins, announced they would not be able to pay the $24 to $28 million required for the new arena. Storer Broadcasting ended up selling the Bruins and the Boston Garden to Jeremy Jacobs who owned Delaware North in 1975. In 1977, the Boston Celtics negotiated with the city of Quincy to have a $30 million, 21,000-seat arena built there.

Partially due to the deteriorating conditions in the Boston Garden, the Celtics did not play a full 41-game home schedule at the arena during its final 21 seasons. Between the 1974–75 and the 1994–95 seasons, the Celtics played a few home games at the Hartford Civic Center (now XL Center) in Hartford, Connecticut.

In 1979, Boston Celtics owner Harry T. Mangurian, Jr. threatened to build a new arena unless the Boston Bruins, who owned the Garden, agreed to lower the rent. The team met with Ogden Corp., owners of Suffolk Downs, who proposed a $20 million, 18,000-seat arena to be built near the racetrack. They also
met with the Boston Redevelopment Authority, who proposed $40 million, 15,000-seat arena that would be built behind the existing Garden and paid for with state bonds. The Bruins meanwhile announced plans to move to a proposed $50 million sports complex on the site of the then closed Rockingham Park in Salem, New Hampshire. The plans for the Salem site were eventually killed by the New Hampshire General Court. Meanwhile, the track remained closed until May 26, 1984.

In response to the Bruins&#x27; plans to leave the state, U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas established a committee to put forward a plan for a new Boston arena. The committee, chaired by Tsongas, proposed a $56.8 million, 16,000-seat arena that would be paid for by tax-exempt bonds floated by an Arena Authority and by raising the commonwealth&#x27;s hotel tax from 5.7% to 8%. The naming rights to the proposed arena were sold to Sheraton for $2 million. Tsongas&#x27; proposal died in the state legislature.

While a preservation study conducted by the Boston Landmarks Commission found the North Station/Boston Garden complex to be a significant example of Art Deco, the Massachusetts Historical Commission did not consider it eligible for listing in the National Register.

In 1985, Garden-owner Delaware North and developer Rosalind Gorin each submitted proposals for a new arena, hotel, and office development. Both proposals were rejected by the Boston Redevelopment Authority and Mayor Raymond Flynn. The two groups later resubmitted plans, with Delaware North&#x27;s calling for a renovation of the Garden instead of having it demolished. Gorin&#x27;s plan called for the city to claim the Garden by eminent domain, as Delaware North refused to sell the Bruins and the Garden to a group led by Gorin, Paul Tsongas, and former Bruins Wayne Cashman and Bobby Orr. Delaware North was awarded the rights to construct the new arena, but poor economic conditions delayed the project.

On May 8, 1992, Delaware North announced they had secured funding for a new arena in the form of $120 million worth of loans evenly split among Bank of Boston, Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, and Shawmut National Corporation. That December, a bill approving construction of the new arena was killed in the Massachusetts Senate by Senate President William M. Bulger. Legislative leaders and Delaware North attempted to reach an agreement on plans for the new arena, but in February 1993 Delaware North owner Jeremy Jacobs announced he was backing out of the project as a result of the legislature&#x27;s demand his company pay $3.5 million in &quot;linkage payments&quot;. Two weeks later, after a new series of negotiations, the two sides came to an agreement, and on February 26 the Legislature passed a bill that allowed for construction of a new sports arena. Construction began on April 29, 1993. Shawmut Bank purchased the naming rights for the new building with the intent of calling it the &quot;Shawmut Center&quot;, but it was purchased by FleetBank before the new arena opened, and thus the &quot;FleetCenter&quot; opened on September 30, 1995. In 2005, the FleetCenter was renamed the &quot;TD Banknorth Garden&quot;, as Bank of America had acquired Fleet Bank and relinquished its predecessor&#x27;s naming rights, selling them to TD Banknorth. As of 2009, it is known as TD Garden.

The Grateful Dead were scheduled to play September 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 19, 1995, as the final event at the Garden. The ticket for the 19th featured the phrase &quot;lets tear this old building down&quot; referencing the song &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. These shows were cancelled upon Jerry Garcia&#x27;s death. The last official game played at the Garden took place on Sunday, May 14, 1995. It was game five of an NHL Eastern Conference quarterfinal series between the Boston Bruins and New Jersey Devils where the New Jersey Devils beat the Bruins, 3–2, winning the series four games to one and eliminating the Bruins from the 1995 Stanley Cup Playoffs en route to that team&#x27;s Stanley Cup victory. The last sporting event at the Boston Garden was a preseason game between the Boston Bruins and the Montreal Canadiens on September 26, 1995. In a special post-game ceremony, which included many former Bruins greats, the banners and retired numbers were removed. The final event in the Boston Garden occurred on the evening of September 29, 1995; a farewell event was held in the old Boston Garden hosted by WBZ-TV news personality Liz Walker and CBS national news anchor Dan Rather. Attendees included Bruins legends such as Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito as well as Celtics greats Larry Bird and Red Auerbach. The ceremony concluded with the release of thousands of balloons into the rafters to the music of the Boston Pops. The Boston Globe stated that &quot;all New England has lost a friend.&quot; The Garden sat vacant for three years before it was demolished in 1998. The site where the building once stood is currently a commercial development called The Hub on Causeway.

<text>Punch-Drunk Love is a 2002 American absurdist romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, and starring Adam Sandler, Emily Watson, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. It follows an entrepreneur with social anxiety who falls in love with his sister&#x27;s co-worker. The film was produced by Columbia Pictures, Revolution Studios and New Line Cinema, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing.

After working on his third film &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Anderson planned to make his next film around 90 minutes, with Sandler in mind as the lead due to Anderson&#x27;s love for him and his films. It features the video art of Jeremy Blake in the form of visual interludes.

The film received positive reviews from critics, with Sandler&#x27;s performance receiving widespread acclaim. However, the film was a box office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million production budget at the box office. Retrospectively, &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; is viewed as a favorite film of several prominent film directors and actors, and was seen as a launchpad for Sandler to pursue dramatic or unconventional film roles outside of his usual mainstream comedies and has been included in lists of the greatest movies of the 2000s and the 21st century.

==Plot==
Barry Egan is a bachelor who owns a company that markets themed toilet plungers and other novelty items. He has seven overbearing sisters who regularly ridicule and emotionally abuse him, so he leads a lonely life punctuated by fits of rage and social anxiety. 

One day, Barry witnesses an inexplicable car accident, picks up an abandoned harmonium from the street, and meets Lena Leonard (a coworker of Elizabeth, one of his sisters). She had orchestrated the meeting after seeing him in Elizabeth&#x27;s family picture at work.

Barry goes to his sister&#x27;s birthday party, where they tease him about his sexuality, leading to a serious outburst in which he breaks sliding glass doors. Afterwards, he privately asks his brother-in-law to refer him to a therapist. 

Instead, Barry calls a phone sex line to cope with his loneliness. The phone sex operator tries to extort money from him and then sends four henchmen, who are brothers, to collect. This complicates his budding relationship with Lena, as well as his plan to exploit a loophole in a Healthy Choice promotion and amass a million frequent-flyer miles by purchasing large quantities of pudding.

When Lena leaves for Hawaii on a business trip, Barry decides to follow her. He uses his sister to find her, who is overjoyed to see him. As the two spend time together, Barry&#x27;s sister calls Lena but she lies about having contact with him. The romance develops further, leading to Barry&#x27;s relief from his emotional isolation.

On the return trip, the four brothers ram Barry&#x27;s car, mildly injuring Lena. After fighting them off with a tire iron, Barry leaves her at the hospital and sets out to end the harassment. He calls the phone-sex line back and finds out the &quot;supervisor&quot; is the owner of a mattress store. 

Barry drives all the way to Provo, Utah, to confront the owner Dean, face to face. At first, trying to intimidate Barry, Dean finds him more intimidating once he learns that he has come all the way from California. They both agree &quot;that&#x27;s that&quot;.

Barry returns home, going to see Lena to explain why the accident happened. He begs for forgiveness, pledging his loyalty and to use his frequent-flier miles to accompany her on all future business trips after his pudding miles are processed. Lena confesses she was more upset at being left at the hospital, but forgives Barry and they embrace happily.

==Production==

After the success of &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Paul Thomas Anderson stated that he was determined to make his next film ninety minutes long, and stated that he wanted to cast Adam Sandler in this film. After establishing his style with his previous films, he wanted to challenge himself within the parameters of a ninety-minute-long romantic comedy. Anderson is a fan of Sandler&#x27;s comedies, and said his love for his films became &quot;obsession-level&quot; after seeing and enjoying Sandler&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. He was determined to make a film with Sandler as a lead, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s always just made me laugh, he gets me, I wanted a piece of him.&quot; He specifically wrote &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; with Sandler and Emily Watson in mind. Anderson had to convince producer JoAnne Sellar, who was &quot;befuddled&quot; with his desire to cast Sandler, that he was the right person for the job. Anderson took inspiration for Barry Egan&#x27;s characterization from watching the &quot;Saturday Night Live: The Best of Adam Sandler&quot; compilation DVD, primarily with the skit &quot;The Denise Show,&quot; saying,

Anderson described the film as an &quot;art-house Adam Sandler film,&quot; while film critic Roger Ebert felt Anderson &quot;deconstructed the Adam Sandler movies and put them back together again in a new way at a different level.&quot; In writing the elements of the Healthy Choice frequent-flier miles sub-plot line, Anderson was inspired by the real-life story of David Phillips, who successfully amassed over a million frequent flier miles from buying $3,000 worth of Healthy Choice&#x27;s pudding. Anderson received approval from Phillips and Healthy Choice to adapt Phillips&#x27; story into the film. A major source of inspiration for &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; came from the films of Jacques Tati, while Barry&#x27;s blue suit was inspired by musicals, such as &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953) and &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952)&quot;.&quot;

Filming and editing took place over a year and a half due to several reasons, such as Anderson scrapping the first two weeks of shooting over fears that he was &quot;making the same movie&quot; as his previous filmography, as well as the threat of Hollywood strikes in 2001, that led to Sandler and Watson filming other projects in between filming &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;. Anderson declined more funding from Revolution Studios, as he was determined to keep the film under $30 million in terms of budget.

Anderson brought in the visual artist Jeremy Blake to create what the &quot;New York Times&quot; called &quot;trippy, fluid sequences of abstract art&quot; to use as transitions in the film.

=== Casting ===
Sandler shared phone numbers with Tom Cruise, when he visited &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during the taping of an episode hosted by Cruise&#x27;s then-wife Nicole Kidman. While filming &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Anderson contacted Sandler through a phone call with Cruise and expressed his intention to write a film for him, and despite being unfamiliar with Anderson, Sandler gave his blessing. Sandler was intimidated upon first viewing &quot;Magnolia&quot;, leading him to be &quot;fucking terrified&quot; and doubt his ability to carry Anderson&#x27;s next film. Anderson helped alleviate Sandler&#x27;s fears upon personally delivering the script. Sandler&#x27;s casting was officially announced in November 2000; the unconventional pairing shocked reporters as Anderson was a rising filmmaker noted for his critically acclaimed films, while Sandler was known for negatively-reviewed mainstream comedies. Aside from the primary named cast, all on-screen actors are non-professionals, which Anderson found more interesting and less complicated.

==Music==
The score to &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; was composed by Jon Brion. As with &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Brion and Anderson collaborated heavily for the production of the film&#x27;s score. However, rather than scoring the film after rough footage had been shot, Brion made compositions while the film was being made. During the scoring process, Brion would experiment with tones and sounds, carefully making note of what Anderson would respond to. Anderson would create the vocal tempos he would envision in the score and use them on set, even to the extent of inspiring the pace of Sandler&#x27;s performance.

The film&#x27;s score features no harmonium in the score outside of the notes Sandler plays on it. Brion introduced the instrument to Anderson during their work on &quot;Magnolia&quot;, however an article stating it was used heavily in the score is incorrect per Brion&#x27;s account. Many scenes between Sandler&#x27;s character and the instrument were inspired by Brion. For instance, Brion once found a harmonium with a hole in its bellows, before going on tour with Aimee Mann. To fix the problem, he covered the hole with duct tape. The situation is mirrored in the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film began a limited domestic release on October 11, 2002, grossing $118,539 from five theaters. It had grossed $17.8 million in the United States, and an international total of $6.8 million, for a worldwide box office total of $24.6 million.

===Critical reception===

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; holds an approval rating of 79% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Odd, touching, and unique, &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; is also delightfully funny, utilizing Adam Sandler&#x27;s comic persona to explore the life of a lonely guy who finds love.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers felt the pairing of Anderson and Sandler was &quot;parallel lines that meet triumphantly in a mesmerizer that stays true to both of their anarchic spirits,&quot; and praised the cast&#x27;s performances, ultimately calling the film&#x27;s effect &quot;intoxicating.&quot; Angie Errigo of &quot;Empire&quot; complimented Anderson&#x27;s direction as &quot;simply captivating and exquisitely controlled, with a restless mood and no end of fascinating, beautifully-orchestrated oddness,&quot; and said, &quot;One of the joys of this film...is that you really have no idea what&#x27;s going to happen next.&quot; Daniel Fierman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought the film was a &quot;meditation on true love, the ways in which we are all bizarre, the magic of the perfect match, and the preposterously unlikely nature of the whole enterprise.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; Kenneth Turan stated that the film was &quot;a comedy of discomfort and rage that turns unexpectedly sweet and pure.&quot; Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy said that &quot;there is no mistaking the exceeding creativity that has gone into nearly every shot, transition, narrative choice and musical selection,&quot; and praised Adam Sandler, Emily Watson, and Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s performances. He also opined that &quot;Sandler fans will probably take it as a lightweight, but agreeable enough, outing with slightly weird elements to it, while Anderson partisans could split between those who will revel in the thrill of his ongoing creative inventions and others who may find this light lifting between heavy workouts.&quot; Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon.com&quot; described the film as a &quot;manic-depressive romantic comedy that aspires to the soul of a musical,&quot; and complimented Anderson&#x27;s direction, Christopher Scarabosio&#x27;s sound design, and Jon Brion&#x27;s score. He believed that Anderson properly utilized the &quot;threat of sudden, bellowing, red-faced rage&quot; of Sandler&#x27;s known comic persona in the film.

David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; described the film as &quot;a romantic comedy on the verge of a nervous breakdown,&quot; praising the film&#x27;s unpredictability and cinematography, but felt Lena was underwritten, concluding that it was &quot;an emotional jigsaw puzzle that&#x27;s missing a couple of crucial pieces.&quot; Giving the film three stars out of five, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt the story was &quot;deeply unconvincing&quot; and &quot;a short cut to an entirely unearned emotional resolution that doesn&#x27;t begin to illuminate the jagged and disturbing - and gripping - ideas that swirl around the beginning of this film,&quot; and felt the film&#x27;s core romance was &quot;the most bafflingly unreal love story you can imagine.&quot;

Sandler&#x27;s lead performance received acclaim. Giving the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised Sandler&#x27;s performance in his review, saying, &quot;Sandler, liberated from the constraints of formula, reveals unexpected depths as an actor. Watching this film, you can imagine him in Dennis Hopper roles. He has darkness, obsession and power. He can&#x27;t go on making those moronic comedies forever, can he?&quot; Errigo called the film &quot;an anti-Adam Sandler movie that proves to be a highly defining moment for the actor&quot; and called Sandler&#x27;s performance &quot;astonishing.&quot; She also felt Watson was &quot;relishing a calming character who is on an even keel.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman said Sandler was &quot;utterly winning to watch&quot; and added that &quot;he has become a tender and arresting presence, like a fusion of Chaplin’s Little Tramp, Woody Allen, and Edward Scissorhands.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; proclaimed that Sandler gave &quot;the performance of his life&quot; in the film.

==Accolades==
Sandler went on to win Best Actor at the Gijón International Film Festival for his performance and was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Anderson won the award for Best Director at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and the film was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or. The film was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. 
==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and DVD by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment on June 24, 2003.

The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray in November 2016 with a restored HD transfer, the first time the company had done so for Anderson and Sandler. It has behind-the-scenes featurette about a recording session for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, a Cannes press conference and deleted scenes.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; came in at #33 in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; &quot;Top 50 films of the &#x27;00s&quot;, while &quot;Time Out&quot; listed the film as one of the best films of the 21st century. Filmmakers Francis Ford Coppola, Lee Unkrich, Judd Apatow, Kleber Mendonça, Miranda July, Bong Joon-ho, David Gordon Green, Guillermo del Toro, Jason Reitman, Isabel Sandoval, Barry Jenkins and Taika Waititi, and actors Brad Pitt, Bill Nighy, Owen Wilson, Javier Bardem, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cillian Murphy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Austin Butler, Guy Pearce, Timothée Chalamet, and Andrew Scott have cited it as one of their favorite films. The film was a major visual influence for the 2024 Pixar film &quot;Inside Out 2&quot;.

When asked about &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; following its twentieth anniversary in 2022, Sandler said that the film that enabled him to pursue films different from his usual roles, while sharing that it helped forge a close friendship between him and Anderson. The two reunited in their first project since &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; when Anderson helped film segments of Sandler&#x27;s Netflix comedy special &quot;100% Fresh&quot; (2018)&quot;.&quot;

Critics agreed that &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; remained as one of Sandler&#x27;s best acting performances, and was a launchpad for Sandler to take on dramatic roles or opportunities outside of his usual mainstream comedies. In a retrospective review following its 2017 release on Netflix, &quot;GQ&quot;&#x27;s Miranda Popkey called the film &quot;Adam Sandler&#x27;s finest performance and P.T. Anderson&#x27;s most underrated work,&quot; describing it as &quot;a paean to love as a source of unfathomable power.&quot; &quot;Far Out&quot;&#x27;s Arun Starkey described &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; as Sandler&#x27;s &quot;first true foray into auteur cinema&quot; and &quot;the first indicator of his prowess as an actor and shows that if he is given a good enough script that isn&#x27;t shackled by the tropes of a mainstream genre, he can actually do very well at carrying a three-dimensional character onto the big screen.&quot; Alan Dorich of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; shared that the film&#x27;s critical success &quot;changed the course of Sandler&#x27;s career forever&quot; and &quot;opened new opportunities that enhanced his legacy as a performer,&quot; leading to other dramatic roles in films such as &quot;Men, Women &amp; Children&quot; (2014), &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot; (2017), and &quot;Uncut Gems&quot; (2019).

<doc id="630727" wikidata="Q982194" url="?curid=630727" title="Hai ben Sherira">
<text>Hai ben Sherira (Hebrew: האיי בר שרירא) better known as Hai Gaon (Hebrew: האיי גאון), was a medieval Jewish theologian, rabbi and scholar who served as Gaon of the Talmudic academy of Pumbedita during the early 11th century. He was born in 939 and died on March 28, 1038. He received his Talmudic education from his father, Sherira ben Hanina, and in early life acted as his assistant in teaching. In his forty-fourth year he became associated with his father as &quot;&quot;av bet din&quot;,&quot; and with him delivered many joint decisions. According to &quot;Sefer HaKabbalah&quot; of Rabbi Abraham ben David (Ravad), he was the last of the &quot;Geonim&quot;.

==Appointment as Gaon==

As a consequence of the calumnies of their antagonists Hai and his father were imprisoned together and their property was confiscated by the Abbasid caliph al-Qadir in 997. The imprisonment was brief, but shortly thereafter (in 998) the aged and infirm Sherira appointed his son to the position of gaon. Hai&#x27;s installation was greeted with great enthusiasm by the Jewish population. An old tradition says that on the Sabbath after Sherira&#x27;s death, at the end of the reading of the weekly lesson, the passage in which Moses asks for an able follower was read in honor of Hai. Thereupon, as haftarah, the story of Solomon&#x27;s accession to the throne was read, the last verse being modified as follows: &quot;And Hai sat on the throne of Sherira his father, and his government was firmly established.&quot; Hai remained gaon until his death in 1038. He was celebrated by the Spanish poet Solomon ibn Gabirol and by Samuel ibn Naghrillah.

==Writings==
===Responsa===

Hai ben Sherira&#x27;s chief claim to recognition rests on his numerous responsa, in which he gives decisions affecting the social and religious life of the Diaspora. Questions reached him from Germany, France, Iberia, Anatolia, the Maghreb, and even India and Ethiopia. His responsa, more than 800 in number, deal with civil law, especially laws concerning women, with ritual, holidays, and so on. Many of them contain explanations of certain halakhot, aggadot, and Talmudic matters. In halakhic decisions he quotes the Jerusalem Talmud, but without ascribing any authority to it. Many of his responsa may have been written in Arabic; only a few of them have been preserved.

===Legal treatises===

Hai ben Sherira codified various branches of Talmudic law. His works include:
* An Arabic treatise on sales and transactions, translated into Hebrew by Isaac Albargeloni with the title &quot;HaMekach vehaMimkar&quot; (; 1078).
* &quot;Sefer ha-Mashkon,&quot; a treatise on mortgage law, anonymously translated into Hebrew
* &quot;Mishpetei haTena&#x27;im,&quot; a treatise on conditions, also anonymously translated into Hebrew.
These three treatises were published together (Venice, 1604); later editions also contain commentaries by Eleazar ben Aryeh (Vienna, 1800) and by Hananiah Isaac Michael Aryeh (Salonica, 1814). Another anonymous translation of them exists in manuscript under the title &quot;Dinei Mamonot.&quot;

According to Rabbi David Azulai, Hai also wrote in Arabic &quot;Sha&#x27;arei Shevu&#x27;ot,&quot; a treatise on oaths. According to another Hebrew source, the original title was &quot;Kitab al-Aiman.&quot; This treatise was twice anonymously translated into Hebrew: (1) &quot;Mishpeṭe Shebu&#x27;ot&quot; (Venice, 1602; Altona, 1782); (2) &quot;Sefer Mehubbar be-Kotzer Min ha-Dinim be-Bi&#x27;ur Kelalim we-&#x27;liqarim be-Helqe Hiyyub la-Shebu&#x27;ah&quot; &quot;Sha&#x27;arei Shevu&#x27;ot&quot; was metrically arranged by an anonymous writer, probably of the 13th century, under the title &quot;Sha&#x27;arei Dinei Mamonot ve-Sha&#x27;arei Shevu&#x27;ot,&quot; and by Levi ben Jacob Alkalai.

Hai&#x27;s treatise on boundary litigations, &quot;Metzranut,&quot; is known only through quotations.

&quot;Hilkot Tefillin, Siddur Tefillah&quot; and &quot;Metibot&quot; are also quoted as his.

===Commentaries on the Mishnah===

Hai ben Sherira&#x27;s philological abilities were directed towards interpreting the Mishnah; of this work only the portion on Seder Tohorot is extant; it was published by T. Rosenberg in &quot;Qobetz Ma&#x27;aseh&quot; (Berlin, 1856). This commentary contains especially interesting linguistic notes, Arabic and Aramaic being often adduced for comparison. The author quotes the Mishnah, the two Talmuds, the Tosefta, the Sifra, Targums Onkelos and Jonathan, the Septuagint, the works of Saadia Gaon, the &quot;Sifre Refu&#x27;ah,&quot; and other anonymous sources. He also quotes his own commentary on Zera&#x27;im (p. 34) and on Baba Batra (p. 43). These quotations, and many others cited by the Arukh, prove that the commentary extended to the whole Mishnah, containing among other explanations historical and archeological notes. Some passages of the commentary are quoted by Alfasi and Hananel on Yoma, and by Solomon ibn Adret in his &quot;Hiddushim&quot;. while Abu al-Walid ibn Janah cites Hai&#x27;s commentary to Shabbat frequently.

===Other works===
It is uncertain whether Hai wrote commentaries in Arabic on the Bible as a whole or on parts of it. Abraham ibn Ezra, however, in his commentary on the Book of Job quotes several of his explanations.

Hai compiled also a dictionary of especially difficult words in the Bible, Targum, and Talmud, the Arabic title of which was &quot;al-Hawi&quot;. Abraham ibn Ezra translated this title, in his &quot;Moznayim,&quot; into &quot;Ha-Me&#x27;assef,&quot; while Abu Bukrat&#x27;s translation, &quot;Ha-Kolel,&quot; and Moses Botarel&#x27;s translation, &quot;Ha-Qemitzah,&quot; did not become popular. Fragments of this dictionary were discovered and published by Harkavy; these show that the work was arranged according to an alphabetic-phonetic plan of three consonants in every group; for instance, s.v. אהל it quotes the permutations אהל, אלה, הלא, האל, לאה. Judah ibn Balaam is the earliest Jewish author who expressly quotes this dictionary. Moses ibn Ezra and some North African rabbis of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries also mention it.

===Works of disputed attribution===

Of Hai&#x27;s poetical writings few have been preserved, and even of these the genuineness is doubted. The didactic poem &quot;Musar Haskel&quot; is generally regarded as authentic, though Dukes expressed some doubts as to its genuineness, as old Jewish authors like al-Harizi and ibn Tibbon do not mention it; and Steinschneider also regarded it as of doubtful authenticity. The first edition appeared about 1505 (see Fano); others were published in Constantinople (1531), in Paris (1559), and elsewhere. The modern editions are as follows: Dukes, &quot;Ehrensäulen,&quot; p. 96; Grätz, &quot;Blumenlese,&quot; p. 27; Steinschneider, &quot;Musar Haskel,&quot; Berlin, 1860; Weiss, &quot;Liqquṭe Qadmonim,&quot; Warsaw, 1893; Philipp, &quot;Sämmtliche Gedichte des R. Hai Gaon,&quot; Lemberg, 1881; a Latin translation by Jean Mercier, &quot;Cantica Eruditionis Intellectus Auctore per Celebri R. Hai,&quot; Paris, 1561; another by Caspar Seidel, &quot;Carmen Morale ΣτροφορυΘμον Elegantissimum R. Chai,&quot; etc., Leipzig, 1638. The &quot;Musar Haskel&quot; consists of 189 double verses in the Arabic meter &quot;rajaz,&quot; and it is said to have therefore received the title of &quot;Arjuzah.&quot; If it really belongs to Hai, he was, as far as is known, the first Eastern writer to use an Arabic meter in Hebrew poetry. Every strophe is complete in itself, and independent of the preceding strophe.

Some piyyutim are ascribed to him, as the piyyut beginning with the words &quot;Shema&#x27; qoli,&quot; preserved in the Sephardic liturgy for the evening of Yom Kippur.

Many spurious writings have been ascribed to Hai, especially by later kabalists. Among them are a &quot;Sefer kol ha-Shem ba-Koah&quot;; &quot;Pitron Halomot,&quot; Ferrara, 1552; &quot;Sefer Refafot,&quot; &quot;ib.&quot;; &quot;Perush me-&#x27;Alenu&quot;; &quot;Teshubah,&quot; on the thirteen rules of R. Ishmael and on the Ten Sefirot; &quot;A Letter to the Priests of Africa&quot;. Some of the responsa attributed to him are mere forgeries. Others again were falsified or mutilated by later additions and interpolations, as, for instance, the one containing attacks upon Aristotle and his philosophy.

==Characteristics==
Hai was not only a master of Hebrew lore, but was also familiar with the Quran and the Hadith, with Plato, Aristotle, Alfarabi, the grammarian al-Halil, the Septuagint, the Greek calendar, Greek history, and the Persian language translation of &quot;Kalilah wa-Dimnah&quot;. He did not hesitate to consult even the Catholicos of the Assyrian Christians in an exegetical difficulty over Psalms 141:5, as the Sicilian dayyan Matzliah ibn al-Basak relates in his biography of Hai. Hai justified his action by saying that scholars in former times did not hesitate to receive explanations from those of other beliefs. He had an exact knowledge of the theological movements of his time, of which that of the orthodox Ash&#x27;ariyyah attracted him the most. Moses ibn Ezra, in his &quot;Poetik&quot; (fol. 1196), even called him a Mutakalam. He was also competent to argue with Muslim theologians, and sometimes adopted their polemical methods. Hai was orthodox as regards tradition, and upheld minhag to its fullest extent. He established the principle that where the Talmud gives no decision traditional customs must be adhered to. He even went so far as to recommend the observance of every custom not in direct opposition to law. In many passages of his responsa he warns against deviating from a custom even when the meaning of its origin has been lost, as in the case of the practice of not drinking water during the Tekufot. But this did not prevent him from opposing the abuses common to his time. Thus he protested against the practice of declaring null and void all oaths and promises which may be made during the coming year, and against the refusal to grant an honorable burial to excommunicated persons and their connections.

Hai&#x27;s conservative standpoint explains the fact that in the study of esoteric sciences he detected a danger to the religious life and a deterrent to the study of the Law. He warned against the study of philosophy, even when pursued with the plea that it leads to a better knowledge of God.

Of his own views on religious-philosophical subjects only those regarding the anthropomorphisms of the Bible (expressed in his appeal to a well-known dictum of R. Ishmael: &quot;The Torah spoke in language of men&quot;) and one or two other subjects were known prior to the publication of ibn Balaam&#x27;s commentary on the Book of Isaiah. A responsum of Hai given in this commentary discloses his opinion on the subjects of divine fore-knowledge and the predestined length of human life. The essence of divine prescience seems to consist, according to him, in a preknowledge of both hypothetical and actual occurrences. In this he shows the influence of Saadia.

His attitude toward the Kabbalah is determined by his conservative standpoint. Its elements, as far as they can be traced back to the Talmud, he considered to be true. When the inhabitants of Fez made inquiries regarding the proportions of God, he answered, as one of the signers of the responsum, that God is above any corporeal qualification and that the Talmud forbids the public discussion of these things. His answer to the question regarding the interpretation of the Talmudic tradition that four men entered paradise is interesting, and has caused much discussion. He refers to the opinion of various scholars that specially favored persons could attain, by means of castigation and the reciting of psalms, to an ecstatic state in which they might behold the heavenly halls (&quot;heikhalot&quot;) as vividly as if they really had entered them. Contrary to his father-in-law, Samuel ben Hofni, gaon of Sura Academy, he followed former scholars in deeming it possible that God should reveal the marvels of heaven to the pious while in this state of ecstasy. But all the elements of the later Kabbalah not found in Talmudic tradition, such as the belief that miracles could be performed with the names of God, he designated as foolishness not credited by any sensible man.

The best characterization of Hai is given by Steinschneider: &quot;Certain Kabbalistic pieces were ascribed to him; but in truth he was no mystic in the usual sense of the word. In fact he fought against superstition. He was an orthodox Jew, in possession of general culture, but hostile to deeper philosophical research.&quot;

==Legacy==
Hai&#x27;s students included Rabbeinu Chananel and Rav Nissim, the head of the academy at Kairouan.

<text>Fathom is a comic book created by Michael Turner and originally published by Top Cow Productions. It debuted in 1998 and was Michael Turner&#x27;s first creator-owned comic book series. &quot;Fathom&quot; is currently published by Turner&#x27;s own company, Aspen MLT.

Its protagonist is Aspen Matthews, a member of a race of aquatic humanoids called the Blue who possess the ability to control water.

==Publication history==
&quot;Fathom&quot; was created by Michael Turner, who said that he found the inspiration from an issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot;. The first series began in 1998 and was abruptly halted in 2002 when it was discovered that Turner had been diagnosed with cancer. During the period of inactivity on the main series, comic book artist Talent Caldwell drew a miniseries titled &quot;Fathom: Killian&#x27;s Tide&quot;. After Turner&#x27;s cancer went into remission, he left Top Cow and launched his own company, Aspen MLT Inc. During this period there was a legal conflict between Turner and Top Cow as to who owned the rights to &quot;Fathom&quot;.

In 2004, Turner restarted the &quot;Fathom&quot; series and had a preview of its premiere in his company&#x27;s first comic, &quot;Michael Turner Presents: Aspen&quot;. After that, a &quot;Fathom&quot; miniseries titled &quot;Fathom: Dawn of War&quot; was produced and, shortly after that, the series &quot;Fathom: Cannon Hawke&quot; was started. The second volume in the &quot;Fathom&quot; series was drawn by artist Koi Turnbull. The third &quot;Fathom&quot; series was drawn by artist Ale Garza and inked by Sal Regla. In 2017, Fathom got a sixth volume, this time written by Blake Northcott, pencilled by Marco Renna and inked by Mark Roslan.

Dynamite Entertainment also did a &quot;Fathom: Prelude&quot; one-shot, which was co-published with Aspen MLT.

==&quot;Fathom&quot; (1998–2002)==
&quot;Fathom&quot; begins as the cruise ship &quot;Paradise&quot; arrives in San Diego 10 years after its disappearance had been reported. A military quarantine is established to cross-examine the crew and passengers; however, no one on board is aware that they had been missing. Compounding the mystery is a girl who had been discovered by the crew while still at sea. The girl could only remember that her name was Aspen. Aspen is taken from the ship by a vacationing naval officer, Captain Matthews, who adopts her and raises her as his own. Aspen has a strange attraction to water, and spends much of her youth swimming, eventually making the US Olympic team for the 1988 Seoul games. She wins the gold, but has her medal taken away and receives a permanent ban after she fails a rigged drug test. Afterwards, Aspen attends UC San Diego and receives a degree in Marine Biology. She is then invited to study at a top-secret underwater science facility known as the DMD, or Deep Marine Discovery. The DMD is a joint project between the United States and Japan. The facility was built over a strange underwater craft of unknown origin which both nations study to determine its origin. However, the Americans and Japanese no longer trust each other and rely on an intermediary named Cannon Hawke to share research data. Aspen is also introduced to a mysterious man who somehow entered the DMD and requested to be placed into a tube filled with water. He requires no air, leading the DMD to deduce that, despite his appearance, he is not human.

A US Navy test pilot named Chance Calloway is testing an experimental amphibious fighter plane for Admiral Maylander, who heads Naval Intelligence. Maylander is also the man who oversaw the quarantine of the &quot;Paradise&quot;. Chance&#x27;s wingman is killed by a craft resembling the one at the DMD. Violating orders, Chance pursues the craft, first in the air and then underwater. Again disobeying orders, he fires a torpedo at the craft only to have it dissolve into the water before the torpedo reaches its target. Without a target, the torpedo locks onto the generator at the DMD and destroys it, severely damaging the facility. Before she drowns, Aspen is rescued by the man in the tube who springs to life and attempts to take her with him. He begins to dissolve into the water, just like the alien craft, and Aspen begins to dissolve as well. Naval rescue teams arrive and the man flees: Aspen is rescued, but not before Calloway sees her in a half-dissolved form. He goes AWOL to try to find Aspen and figure out what he saw. He eventually finds Aspen, who cannot explain her abilities. Before she can find out any more, she is abducted by government personnel and brought to Killian who is held in the DMD. He tells Aspen that she is a member of a race of aquatic humanoids called the Blue who possess the ability to control water.

===Blue Sun===
Aspen enters the world of the Blue with Killian training her to be a warrior. Aspen has unique powers, even for the Blue, and Killian tricks her into helping him create an enormous weapon. This weapon, later called the &quot;Blue Sun&quot;, is a huge ball of energy out in space powered by three underwater stations on Earth. Killian intends to use this weapon to drill a hole in the Earth&#x27;s crust at a place known to the Blue as Chanarnay, or the &quot;Valley of Stairs&quot;. This hole would drain much of the world&#x27;s oceans although the purpose is not fully known except to Killian.

Before Killian can accomplish this, Aspen is convinced by her new friend Kyla to leave Killian and escape with Cannon Hawke, a member of the Blue himself, who has been following Aspen for years to prevent Killian from using her to activate the Blue Sun. Kyla is an agent of Cannon&#x27;s who was placed into Killian&#x27;s group to collect intelligence on him. Killian nonetheless manages to get his plan in motion but not before Kyla reveals herself to Killian and helps Aspen escape, dying in the process. Aspen, Cannon and Chance follow Killian to Chanarnay where Cannon fights Killian to buy time for Aspen to stop the Blue Sun. Cannon is wounded and Killian throws Aspen into a light beam and thinks he has killed her. Aspen in fact has gained near god-like abilities from the raw energy of the beam. She then kills Killian and destroys the beam.

===The Spelunker===
After the Blue Sun incident, Aspen finally gets some rest, or so she thinks. After strange deaths occur from the jaws of an unknown sea creature, a crazy old man shows up at Aspen&#x27;s door. The man brings her aboard the &quot;Spelunker&quot;, a strange submarine-like vessel, and in a very &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;-like fashion, they hunt down the creature named &quot;Big Moe&quot;.

Aspen ends up killing two of the unknown sea creatures after finding Big Moe to be their parent. Big Moe gets away and the old man and Aspen part ways. The old man has since appeared in a single issue of Aspen Seasons as a possible foreshadow for his and the &quot;Spelunker&quot;″s eventual return to the series.

===Resurrection of Taras===
Around a year after the Blue Sun event, Cannon finds himself on his yacht with Lara Croft, an archaeologist and adventurer. While relaxing, he is attacked and kidnapped by Biranha, the brother of Taras. Lara goes unnoticed and contacts her friend Sara Pezzini, a New York detective and wielder of the Witchblade, for help.

Cannon awakes in an underwater city in the Atlantic. He is being held hostage by Vana, leader of the Arctic Blue, and mother of Biranha and Taras. The Arctic Blue are a separate sect of the Blue living in the freezing cold north and have adapted abilities to control ice. Vana wants revenge on Cannon for the near death of her son. It turns out that Taras was not actually killed in the Blue Sun but rather evaporated to a large degree. Vana uses a machine to try to place Taras&#x27; remains into Cannon so that Taras might live again in Cannon&#x27;s body.

Meanwhile, Sara and Lara begin searching for clues as to where Cannon might have been taken when they run into Aspen. At the same time, Aspen is being targeted by Biranha&#x27;s men. Aspen and Sara end up working together only to be knocked out and kidnapped. They awaken in the underwater city below the Atlantic Ocean. It turns out Vana also blames Aspen for what has happened to her son and wishes to see Aspen dead. Thankfully Lara is still free and on the way to rescue the women, having followed Biranha&#x27;s team home.

Vana&#x27;s experiment comes to a saddening end when Cannon absorbs all of Taras and turns into a horrible abomination, a mere shadow of a man that can barely speak. Vana intends to kill this haunting image of Cannon, believing her son fully lost, until Taras&#x27; mind bleeds through, forcing Cannon to say, &quot;I learned to walk before I could crawl&quot;. Realizing Taras is still in Cannon&#x27;s body, Vana tries to undo the experiment, hopefully getting things right this time. As this is going on, Lara sneaks in and frees Aspen and Sara. The trio of women leave the base only to return, realizing they must free Cannon at all costs.

This time, Vana&#x27;s experiment works, bringing Cannon back to his normal self as well as recreating Taras&#x27; body. However, when Sara and Lara break into the chamber, a fight ensues. During this, Sara is in her own fight, facing and killing Biranha. Vana and Aspen exchange blasts of ice and water until Vana shoots one directly at Aspen. Rather than dodge it, Aspen reflects the blast by turning her arms into a form of hard water. The blast ricochets off Aspen&#x27;s arms and blows up the capsule Taras was in, killing him. The girls grab Cannon and run as Vana makes a desperate suicidal final move. It is a race against time for them to get out of the enemy base as Vana explodes her body into hundreds of long sharp icicles. The group manages to escape to Cannon&#x27;s yacht, and they relax after such a dangerous adventure.

Cannon did not leave Vana&#x27;s headquarters without cost. As he looks in the mirror he sees Taras smiling back at him as he is now stuck in the deep recesses of his subconscious.

This was the last storyline of the first volume of &quot;Fathom&quot;, as well as the last &quot;Fathom&quot; story to be published through Top Cow Productions.

====Legal changes====
Due to legal restrictions in using the Top Cow characters from &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; and &quot;Witchblade&quot;, &quot;The Fathom, Vol. 1: The Definitive Edition&quot; contains a re-engineered version of this story which removes the characters of Lara and Sara, and re-focuses the story on Aspen&#x27;s character only.

==&quot;Fathom&quot; (2005–present)==

===&quot;Aspen&quot;===
The &quot;Michael Turner Presents: Aspen&quot; mini-series marks the final &quot;Fathom&quot; story drawn by creator Michael Turner. The three-issue series introduces the new characters of Kiani, Casque, Brande, and Siphon. It also introduces &quot;the Black&quot;, a brother species to the Blue. At the end of the series, the Black kidnap Aspen and bring her to the bottom of the ocean. This acts as a precursor to &quot;Fathom: Dawn of War

===&quot;Dawn of War&quot;===
&quot;Fathom: Dawn of War&quot; bridges the gap between the original series and &quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 2. The story focuses on the Blue warrior Kiani, who is forced to side with the rebellious councilman Marqueses in order to save her master, Casque, from the clutches of human military scientists. Marqueses has engineered the situation in order to kidnap Casque and to secure the older warrior&#x27;s immense power for an offensive against the humans. Kiani tracks down Marqueses and saves Casque only to find he is part of the Black. The Black come for Casque, and he is forced to rejoin them, leaving Kiani angry and lost.

&quot;Dawn of War&quot; emphasizes Kiani&#x27;s loneliness and character development. It also introduces audiences further to the underwater world of the Blue.

===&quot;Fathom Prelude&quot; and &quot;Beginnings&quot;===
&quot;Fathom Prelude&quot; and &quot;Fathom Beginnings&quot; were two one-shot stories from 2005 that gave glimpses into Aspen&#x27;s past.

&quot;Fathom Prelude&quot; showed Aspen&#x27;s teenage life and her journey with the USA Olympic Swimming team. The story sheds some light on why she was stripped of her gold medal and includes a possible appearance by the Unknown.

&quot;Fathom Beginnings&quot; shows Aspen&#x27;s first appearance on the cruise ship &quot;Paradise&quot;. More clues are given as to the identity of the Unknown and the reasons for his physical state.

===&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 2===
&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 2 primarily focuses on the developments between the American government and the Blue. Volume 1 revealed that Admiral Maylander knew of the Blue&#x27;s presence, and this series sees him take action against the underwater race. He does so by a sneak attack on the Blue city of Saba. Aspen, kidnapped by the Black, meets her father, Rahger, and learns that she is also part of the Black.

===&quot;Cannon Hawke&quot;===
The &quot;Fathom: Cannon Hawke&quot; mini-series ran parallel with the first few issues of &quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 2. They detailed Cannon&#x27;s exile from the Blue as well as his fight with Taras.

===&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 3===
&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 3 was drawn by &quot;Fathom&quot; newcomer Ale Garza. This time, the focus is divided between the returning Killian, thought dead in volume 2, his newfound allegiance with his abandoned daughter, Kiani, and the rise of the Blue&#x27;s ancestor race the Black.

===&quot;Fathom: Blue Descent&quot;===
&quot;Fathom: Blue Descent&quot; is a 5-issue mini-series published in 2010. The series was written by David Schwartz. Art for the zero issue was provided by Scott Clark, with Alex Sanchez stepping in for the art on issues #1–4. Covers were drawn by Clark and Sanchez, and also David Finch, Billy Tan, Joe Benitez, Nick Bradshaw, and Michael Turner. The series reveals Aspen Matthews&#x27; secret, formerly hidden past. It introduces new characters in Aspen&#x27;s parents, Eilah and Abesaloma, and their childhood friend, Zo. It also features many returning characters, such as Aspen, Finn, Cannon, Killian, and the Black.

===&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 4===
&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 4 was drawn by Alex Konat and written by Scott Lobdell. In this volume, Aspen joins with new allies, faces new enemies and discovers the mysterious Church of the Eternal Depths. This time, Aspen must deal with the global ramifications of the Blue and Black&#x27;s exposure to the rest of the world.

===&quot;Fathom: The Elite Saga&quot;===
&quot;Fathom: The Elite Saga&quot; is a 5-issue mini-series published in 2013. The series was written by Vince Hernandez along with J.T. Krul and David Wohl. In the series, Aspen is attempting to find solace above the surface by distancing herself from the demons of her past. The series also shows returning characters including Killian and Kiani. Killian is in search of his missing wife Anya, and his newborn child Anika while Kiani escapes from her imprisonment to get her revenge on Aspen. The series also serves as a celebration and culmination of 15 years of &quot;Fathom.&quot;

===&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 5===
&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 5, also known as &quot;All New Fathom&quot;, published 2013–2014, shows Aspen battles the return of the Arctic Blue and shows Anya&#x27;s daughter, Anika all grown up raised by the resurrected Vana. Aspen teams up with Killian and Chance to prevent the Arctic Blue&#x27;s plot to bring a frozen apocalypse on Earth and must prevent them from attacking Muria, the Blues&#x27; capital city.

===&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 6===
&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 6, also known as &quot;Michael Turner&#x27;s All New Fathom&quot;, published since February 2017, includes an all new creative team; Blake Northcott (writer), Marco Renna (pencils), Mark Roslan (digital inks), John Starr (colors) and Zen (letters). In this volume, Aspen Matthews inadvertently releases a group of incarcerated underwater beings called The Typhos, who are bent on overthrowing The Blue. Her identity is also exposed to the human world, forcing her into hiding.

===&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 7===
&quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 7, also known as &quot;Michael Turner&#x27;s All New Fathom&quot;, publishing anticipated June 2018, includes a new creative team of writer Ron Marz (Green Lantern, Witchblade) and artist Siya Oum (Lola XOXO). This all-new adventure for Aspen&#x27;s preeminent hero sees her attempt to navigate an ever-changing world where The Blue are not only present above the surface-but exploited in new and dangerous ways. When a rival nation to The States decides to take control of the global landscape by tapping into the power of The Blue, Aspen Matthews discovers that a new adversary has risen to challenge the notion that she is the most powerful person on the planet-and humanity may suffer the consequences!

==Characters==
* Aspen Matthews – Main protagonist.
* Chance Calloway – Aspen&#x27;s boyfriend.
* Admiral James Maylander – An admiral in the US Navy who declares war on the Blue, although is defeated by Aspen.
* Cannon Hawke – Aspen&#x27;s guardian with the Blue, and Commander of the Elite Council Defense Strike Force. He was killed by Kiani in the final stages of the Black invasion; prompting Aspen to retaliate and (temporarily) destroy Kiani.
* Siphon – A member of the Elite Council Defense Strike Force and son of ex-Council member Kinzin. Siphon takes his father&#x27;s place on the Council. He later ascends to become leader of the Blue Council.
* Killian – A rogue Blue leader and ardent enemy of mankind, originally an enemy of Aspen. Later he joins the Blue government under Siphon and becomes Commander of the Elite Guard under Siphon&#x27;s command.
* Anya – The secret lover of Killian and mother of Kiani and Anika. Later after Siphon leaves behind his revolutionary ways their relationship becomes public knowledge, the two marry and have a second daughter, Anika.
* Kiani – Killian and Anya&#x27;s headstrong, violent and completely immoral daughter and a member of the Elite Council Defense Strike Force. Later she joins Killian&#x27;s attacks on the Earth, and continued on after Killian stood down. Kiani refused to listen to reason and continued on, ultimately leading her to kill Cannon and battle Aspen. Ultimately, Aspen defeated Kiani, whereby she disintegrated, apparently dying. Kiani somehow survived from Aspen&#x27;s power and briefly resurfaced to locate her kidnapped infant sister, Anika. When she (apparently) dies due to her violent attempts to intervene, Kiani is consumed with guilt and goes into self-imposed exile.
* Anika/Kania – The youngest daughter of both Killian and Anya and sister of Kiani. Vana also raises her as Kania after the event of the Elite Saga.
* Brande – A member of the Elite Council Defense Strike Force and best friend of Siphon and Kiani. He dies during Maylander&#x27;s attack.
* Vana – Leader of the &quot;Arctic Blue&quot; and mother of Taras and Biranha. She is a scientific genius who is the enigmatic leader of the Blue&#x27;s arctic settlement, and has a reputation of being nominally eccentric. After both her sons die due to Killian, she later gains vengeance by taking Anika, Killian&#x27;s infant second daughter, and transforming her into Kania – who sees her as her mother.
* Taras – A male &quot;Arctic Blue&quot; warrior, brother of Biranha, and Killian&#x27;s lieutenant. He dies, along with his brother, serving with Killian.
* Biranha – A male &quot;Arctic Blue&quot; warrior and brother of Taras. He dies, along with his brother, serving with Killian.
* Judith Banyaski – Aspen&#x27;s friend and personal assistant.
* Colin Woreth – Aspen&#x27;s friend, personal assistant and former teacher.
* Akiko Nigata – Cannon&#x27;s personal assistant and friend.
* Tyler – Aspen&#x27;s roommate and a television news anchor.
* Thassalar – Leader of the recently bombed city of Saba — Thassalar has helped Cannon and the Council Strike force to oppose Biranha.
* Mysterious Blue/Finn – A translucent Blue stuck in a semi-water state and Aspen&#x27;s older brother.
* Casque – A member of the Black, but also a friend of Cannon and Kiani&#x27;s mentor.
* Rahger – Biological father of Aspen and leader of the Black — a more powerful underwater race than that of the Blue. Ragher met Aspen, but was unable to convince her to join his people&#x27;s efforts to destroy mankind. Undeterred, he continued his war preparations hoping that Aspen will eventually join him. His invasion fails when Aspen stands against and defeats him.

==Collected editions==
==Movie adaptation==
&quot;Fathom&quot;&#x27;s popularity and originality led to it getting a green light in 2002 as a feature film. The film was to be made by director James Cameron and his production company Lightstorm Entertainment; but nothing developed. 

There has been a conflict with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Surface&quot; (2005) television show. The TV show was named &quot;Fathom&quot; originally, but due to copyright infringement on the comic book name, the producers changed it at the last minute to the title &quot;Surface&quot;.

In 2010, a movie adaptation of &quot;Fathom&quot; was under development by Fox Atomic, with Megan Fox signed up to play the role of Aspen Matthews and as a producer on the film. English actor Matthew Tate was to portray Chance Calloway. Screenwriter and video game creator Jordan Mechner was hired to write the script. Michael Turner, who created the series, was to be credited as the film&#x27;s executive producer. The production of the movie met many difficulties, and at the moment it seems to be canceled.

An animated feature adaptation of Fathom is currently in development by Mythos Studios. The announcement was made during a panel at San Diego Comic-Con in 2018.

<text>The Navesink River is an estuary in the eastern United States in Monmouth County, New Jersey. Approximately in length, it is surrounded by the communities of Middletown (including the namesake Navesink CDP), Red Bank, Fair Haven, and Rumson.

Known officially as the North Shrewsbury River and upstream of Red Bank as the Swimming River, it is formed southwest of Red Bank by the confluence of the Swimming River with several smaller streams. It extends ENE along the north side of Red Bank, connecting to the Shrewsbury River estuary at Rumson, approximately south of the entrance of the Shrewsbury River into Sandy Hook Bay near Highlands.

==History==
The area was originally populated by the Lenni Lenape people. In 1665, John Hance was one of the settlers who negotiated with the Navesinks of the Lenni Lenape to purchase the lands of this peninsula and the immediate surroundings through the Monmouth Patent. Following the founding of Red Bank in 1736 (named after its situation on the &quot;red banks&quot; of the Navesink River), the river was important for transportation from the Navesink River communities to New York City and was served by side-wheeler steamboats until the 1950s.

==The Navesink today==
Today the river is a major recreational resource for powerboating, crabbing, fishing, sailing, canoeing, kayaking, bird watching, swimming, and rowing. During particularly cold winters, the Navesink can freeze, adding ice skating and ice boating to the list of recreations available. The area along the Navesink banks is one of the most affluent in New Jersey. Today, the town of Red Bank rests situated on its banks, with hotels and apartment buildings that offer scenic views of the river. Select homes in Red Bank, Fair Haven, and Rumson share similar views.

As a tidal estuary flowing into the Shrewsbury River at Sea Bright, continuing into Sandy Hook Bay and ultimately the Atlantic Ocean, the Navesink provides excellent and scenic fishing opportunities for species such as bluefish (smaller bluefish are known as snappers), striped bass, weakfish and fluke, blackfish, pufferfish, kingfish, spot especially in the spring and fall. Crabbing is particularly popular in the upstream Swimming River section.

==Independence Day fireworks==
Each year from 1960 through 2011, a fireworks display was launched from the river close to Red Bank on July 3, the eve of Independence Day. &quot;KaBoomFest&quot; was held in Marine Park, where local bands and vendors formed a major gathering.

==Dolphins==
The Navesink River was the home to a pod of up to 16 Atlantic bottlenose dolphins from June 2008 into the winter of that year. They are thought to have followed a school of baitfish from the Sandy Hook Bay. The dolphins attracted nearby residents to view them, as well as media attention. Local authorities enforced a requirement on marine traffic to maintain a safe distance from the pod, and even issued tickets to boats that were deemed hazardous to the dolphins&#x27; safety.

In late September 2008, one of the dolphins had been found washed up on the shore, and it was determined that its cause of death was pneumonia. Several days later, another was found floating down the river. Another group of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins reappeared in August 2012 near the Oceanic Bridge.

<text>Burnley Wood is a district and former electoral ward of Burnley, Lancashire. In broad terms the area lies between Parliament Street in the north and Hufling Lane in the south, and from the railway in the west to Todmorden Road in the east. Based on historic definitions of the ward boundary, Burnley Wood could also be defined as including the more affluent areas around the Woodgrove Road area to the east of Todmorden Road, Brooklands Road to the south and the area north of Parliament Street as far as the River Calder. Historically the district was located in the parish and township of Habergham Eaves, separated from the adjacent Burnley township, later Borough by the Calder before being incorporated into the County Borough of Burnley in 1894.

==History==
In the sixteenth-century, as the name suggests, the area was mostly covered by rough moorland and woodland, with a scattering of farmsteads on the outskirts of Burnley. These included Whittaker Farm, at the junction of the present day Hufling Lane and Todmorden Road; Mosely Farm in what is now Glebe Street; Hollin Greave, at the junction of Brunswick Street and Hollingreave Road; and Hufling Hall. The latter is a late seventeenth century farmhouse. It is a grade II listed building and is sandwiched between late nineteenth century housing. Todmorden Road, became a turnpike road in 1817 and became a route of the Burnley Corporation Tramway in 1910.

From 1673 to 1819, the majority of Burnley Wood was glebe land in the ownership of St Peter&#x27;s Church, and as such could not be developed. However, by 1825, as Burnley began to expand rapidly as a burgeoning cotton manufacturing town, spurred on by the completion of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1801, back-to-back cottages and mills began to develop along the canal at Lane Bridge around Finsley Gate. Between 1825 and 1844 Spring Gardens Mill, together with back-to-back housing were built between Plumbe Street and Eastgate (now Yorkshire Street) and coal mining also began to take place on the north bank of the River Calder between Plumbe Street and Oxford Road.

Several large houses in extensive grounds were built along the western side of Todmorden Road at Springfield close to the Hand Bridge passing over the Calder and the lodge house that served the Towneley estate together with a Roman Catholic chapel, at that time outside the boundary of the township of Burnley. A small hamlet developed around the Woodman Inn at the junction of Todmorden Road and Hufling Lane. Further along Hufling Lane, west of &#x27;Hufflen Hall&#x27; a row of cottages known as &#x27;Organ Row&#x27; were built near to Towneley railway station which had opened along the route of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway between Rose Grove and Todmorden in 1849.

In the second half of the nineteenth century, widespread development occurred in Burnley Wood. The residential elements had two distinct characters: large stone-built houses in spacious grounds, flanking Brooklands Road and Todmorden Road and largely providing accommodation for wealthy mill or mine owners and senior employees, and high-density terraced housing. Burnley Wood also saw the development of an extensive number of cotton mills and associated buildings, largely built between 1860 and 1890. This was brought about by increased pressures within Burnley to expand beyond the canal as the town grew rapidly and allow the development of more factories and mills along the course of the Calder with housing and other facilities to meet the living needs of their workers.

Large scale urban development took place on both sides of the river and by the 1880s, Burnley Wood and the adjoining Fulledge district just north of the river between Plumbe Street and Todmorden Road had developed into a densely populated area of terraced housing laid out in a classic grid iron pattern of horizontal and vertical rows of mainly identikit two bedroomed houses. Most houses built in this period benefitted from rear yards accessed directly off back streets, which were wide enough to accommodate carts (and today can still accommodate modern day refuse vehicles). On the other hand, some houses, particularly on the western and southern edges of the district along Hollingreave Road and Glebe Street, parts of Emily Street, Dall Street, Reed Street, Sussex Street and Huffling Lane, were provided with an additional enclosed space at the front of the houses separate from the pavement. Some even had bay windows and basements. Only these houses, together terraces on Parkinson Street, Stoney Street and the western side of Branch Road now remain, many of which were adapted during the 1960s and 1970s to accommodate bathrooms and modern kitchen extensions. There has also been some limited twentieth century infill housing

The mills that had largely provided employment for Burnley Wood and Fulledge residents were centred close to the banks of the Calder around Parliament Street and Oxford Road and included Spa Field Mill, Fulledge Mill, Hand Bridge Mill, Pentridge (or Partridge Mill which was converted into a cinema during the 1920s to serve both Burnley Wood and Fulledge residents), Burnley Wood Mill, Oxford Mill and Springfield Mill. Plumbe Street Shed, a largely single storey cotton weaving shed was located close to the canal. Most of the day-to-day needs of local residents were met through wide network of corner shops built on most streets, particularly those running on an east-west axis including Springfield Road and Brunswick Street, whilst Parliament Street and Oxford Road developed into specific shopping areas supported until at least the late 1990s early 2000s by their own sub post offices.

Following its completion in the late nineteenth century, the area remained poorly connected to the main centre of Burnley for a number of years owing to inadequate bridge crossings over both the canal and River Calder. Only the historic Hand Bridge which carried the Todmorden Road over the Calder existed at the time together with the Turn swing Bridge over the canal at Finsley Gate. This led to a concerted campaign during this period to see improved links with the rest of the town and led to the replacement of the Turn Bridge, an upgrade of Hand Bridge and the construction of the Plumbe Street and Oxford Road bridges with permanent iron structures. Even then, good vehicular connections, including those of tram services which ran from Burnley town centre along Todmorden Road were restricted by the narrow &quot;Culvert&quot; under the canal embankment at Yorkshire Street until it was significantly reconstructed in 1926.

The emerging community were well served with places of worship and education. Late nineteenth century schools included Burnley Wood School located between Glebe Street and Branch Road; Todmorden Road Council Schools; and St. Stephen&#x27;s Church of England School in St. Stephen&#x27;s Street located between Oxford Road and Tarleton Street. St. Stephen&#x27;s remained as the infant school but was closed in 1969 when it joined the junior school overlooking Towneley Holmes in Woodgrove Road, which had been built in the early 1950s. Burnley Wood School was partially demolished in the mid-1980s when dry rot was discovered and the remaining buildings have been converted into apartments. That school relocated to a new site on cleared properties in the area of Waterloo Road and Springfield Road and in the mid-2000s merged with Todmorden Road School, which itself was demolished, the site of which is now the location of the Burnley Register Office. The main place of worship in Burnley Wood continues to be St. Stephen&#x27;s Church on Oxford Road and Smalley Street, which is now a Grade II listed building. The religious needs of non conformists were also met in the district, including the Rehoboth Mission on the corner of Waterloo Road and Springfield Road which was demolished in the 1970s, although its Sunday School, built in 1881 on the corner of Springfield Road and Crowther Street still remains and was for a time used as a community centre for the district. There was a Congregational Church on the corner of Kirkgate and Hollingreave Road with its adjacent Sunday School on the corner with Brunswick Street, demolished in the early 1980s and now replaced by a sheltered housing development, whilst the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel in Brooklands Road and south of Stoney Street still remains.

Remarkably, Burnley Wood had managed to retain almost all of its historic public houses despite seeing significant urban clearance of much of the area around Waterloo Road, the north part of Hirst Street and Russell Street in the 1970s followed by a later clearance in the last decade around May Street, Duke Street and the southern part of Hirst Street. These include the Brittania Inn at corner of what remains of Springfield Road and Oxford Road, which was saved from demolition in the 1970s but sadly closed in 2022 and now converted into flats. The Royal Butterfly at the corner of Hollingreave Road and Hufling Lane, The Rifle Volunteer on the corner of Tarleton Street and Smalley Street which remains closed from May 2022 by the owner, and the historic landmark Woodman Hotel at the southernmost end of Oxford Road and Todmorden Road. The Stanley in Oxford Road closed in 2014. Two other public houses did not survive the 1970&#x27;s clearances; The Owl in the Wood was located on the corner of Springfield Road and Tarleton Street and the Cottage in the Wood was adjacent at the corner of Springfield Road and Rawlinson Street. 

There was also a lively political scene in Burnley Wood during the late nineteenth century which led to the founding of both a Conservative Club in 1876 and Liberal Club both on Brunswick Street. The Conservative Working Men&#x27;s Club (Burnley Wood Club) remains open, although is no longer affiliated to the Conservative Party. After a period of being a Gospel Hall the Liberal Club is now apartments.

==Today==

The area saw a significant amount of urban clearance during the 1970s, resulting in the loss of residential streets including Holton Street, Rawlinson Street, Russell Street, Swainbank Street, Laurel Street and many parts of Waterloo Road, Springfield Road and Brunswick Street, which became fragmented as infill housing such as Russell Court and Brittania Walk. The Gerald Court sheltered housing complex, now itself demolished and the replacement Burnley Wood School, now Springfield Primary School were built on the sites of demolished properties at the northern end of Hirst Street and the northern end of Waterloo Road respectively, and most of the mills ultimately closed and were given over to other industrial and commercial uses. However, in around the mid 1990s, Burnley Wood and its proliferation of predominantly lower grade two bedroom terraced houses began to suffered from housing market failure. It became part of East Lancashire&#x27;s Elevate scheme to clear, rebuild or remodel what were considered to be an over supply of sub-standard housing. The catalyst for this was the 2001 Burnley Riots which brought the problems of Burnley Wood to national attention.

The district lies within the Rosehill with Burnley Wood ward. Demographics show that the ward is 96.86% white British. The index of multiple deprivation places part of Burnley Wood among the 5% most deprived areas in the country, yet parts of neighbouring Rosehill and the area around Woodgrove Road and Brooklands Road within the same ward are in contrast are more affluent than the national average. 21.41% of children in the ward are eligible for free school meals.

The area has a traditionally strong local identity. An active community group, Burnley Wood Community Action Group, publishes a free newspaper, the &quot;Burnley Wood Argus&quot;, for the area, and Burnley Wood Park, a new community park financed by Elevate, has been built in the centre of the early twenty first century housing clearance area around Morley Street. Previously high crime levels, especially antisocial behaviour by young people, now appear to be in decline: there were 114 crimes per 1,000 inhabitants in the year to December 2007 (Lancashire average 89.4), a fall of 19.2% on the previous twelve months. The area to the west of St. Stephen&#x27;s church has now been extensively redeveloped with a mix of larger family dwellings and for the first time in its history now allows the church to be viewed in full from Kirkgate rather than behind the previous row of terraces which were recently demolished.

<text>In mathematics, an arithmetic group is a group obtained as the integer points of an algebraic group, for example formula_1 They arise naturally in the study of arithmetic properties of quadratic forms and other classical topics in number theory. They also give rise to very interesting examples of Riemannian manifolds and hence are objects of interest in differential geometry and topology. Finally, these two topics join in the theory of automorphic forms which is fundamental in modern number theory.

==History==

One of the origins of the mathematical theory of arithmetic groups is algebraic number theory. The classical reduction theory of quadratic and Hermitian forms by Charles Hermite, Hermann Minkowski and others can be seen as computing fundamental domains for the action of certain arithmetic groups on the relevant symmetric spaces. The topic was related to Minkowski&#x27;s geometry of numbers and the early development of the study of arithmetic invariant of number fields such as the discriminant. Arithmetic groups can be thought of as a vast generalisation of the unit groups of number fields to a noncommutative setting.

The same groups also appeared in analytic number theory as the study of classical modular forms and their generalisations developed. Of course the two topics were related, as can be seen for example in Langlands&#x27; computation of the volume of certain fundamental domains using analytic methods. This classical theory culminated with the work of Siegel, who showed the finiteness of the volume of a fundamental domain in many cases.

For the modern theory to begin foundational work was needed, and was provided by the work of Armand Borel, André Weil, Jacques Tits and others on algebraic groups. Shortly afterwards the finiteness of covolume was proven in full generality by Borel and Harish-Chandra. Meanwhile, there was progress on the general theory of lattices in Lie groups by Atle Selberg, Grigori Margulis, David Kazhdan, M. S. Raghunathan and others. The state of the art after this period was essentially fixed in Raghunathan&#x27;s treatise, published in 1972.

In the seventies Margulis revolutionised the topic by proving that in &quot;most&quot; cases the arithmetic constructions account for all lattices in a given Lie group. Some limited results in this direction had been obtained earlier by Selberg, but Margulis&#x27; methods (the use of ergodic-theoretical tools for actions on homogeneous spaces) were completely new in this context and were to be extremely influential on later developments, effectively renewing the old subject of geometry of numbers and allowing Margulis himself to prove the Oppenheim conjecture; stronger results (Ratner&#x27;s theorems) were later obtained by Marina Ratner.

In another direction the classical topic of modular forms has blossomed into the modern theory of automorphic forms. The driving force behind this effort is mainly the Langlands program initiated by Robert Langlands. One of the main tool used there is the trace formula originating in Selberg&#x27;s work and developed in the most general setting by James Arthur.

Finally arithmetic groups are often used to construct interesting examples of locally symmetric Riemannian manifolds. A particularly active research topic has been arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds, which as William Thurston wrote, &quot;...often seem to have special beauty.&quot;

== Definition and construction ==

=== Arithmetic groups ===

If formula_2 is an algebraic subgroup of formula_3 for some formula_4 then we can define an arithmetic subgroup of formula_5 as the group of integer points formula_6 In general it is not so obvious how to make precise sense of the notion of &quot;integer points&quot; of a formula_7-group, and the subgroup defined above can change when we take different embeddings formula_8

Thus a better notion is to take for definition of an arithmetic subgroup of formula_5 any group formula_10 which is commensurable (this means that both formula_11 and formula_12 are finite sets) with a group formula_13 defined as above (with respect to any embedding into formula_14). With this definition, to the algebraic group formula_2 is associated a collection of &quot;discrete&quot; subgroups all commensurable to each other.

=== Using number fields ===

A natural generalisation of the construction above is as follows: let formula_16 be a number field with ring of integers formula_17 and formula_2 an algebraic group over formula_16. If we are given an embedding formula_20 defined over formula_16 then the subgroup formula_22 can legitimately be called an arithmetic group.

On the other hand, the class of groups thus obtained is not larger than the class of arithmetic groups as defined above. Indeed, if we consider the algebraic group formula_23 over formula_7 obtained by restricting scalars from formula_16 to formula_7 and the formula_27-embedding formula_28 induced by formula_29 (where formula_30) then the group constructed above is equal to formula_31.

==Examples==

The classical example of an arithmetic group is formula_32, or the closely related groups formula_33, formula_34 and formula_35. For formula_36 the group formula_37, or sometimes formula_38, is called the modular group as it is related to the modular curve. Similar examples are the Siegel modular groups formula_39.

Other well-known and studied examples include the Bianchi groups formula_40 where formula_41 is a square-free integer and formula_42 is the ring of integers in the field formula_43 and the Hilbert–Blumenthal modular groups formula_44.

Another classical example is given by the integral elements in the orthogonal group of a quadratic form defined over a number field, for example formula_45. A related construction is by taking the unit groups of orders in quaternion algebras over number fields (for example the Hurwitz quaternion order). Similar constructions can be performed with unitary groups of hermitian forms, a well-known example is the Picard modular group.

== Arithmetic lattices in semisimple Lie groups ==

When formula_46 is a Lie group one can define an arithmetic lattice in formula_46 as follows: for any algebraic group formula_2 defined over formula_7 such that there is a morphism formula_50 with compact kernel, the image of an arithmetic subgroup in formula_5 is an arithmetic lattice in formula_46. Thus, for example, if formula_53 and formula_46 is a subgroup of formula_55 then formula_56 is an arithmetic lattice in formula_46 (but there are many more, corresponding to other embeddings); for instance, formula_32 is an arithmetic lattice in formula_59.

=== The Borel–Harish-Chandra theorem ===

A lattice in a Lie group is usually defined as a discrete subgroup with finite covolume. The terminology introduced above is coherent with this, as a theorem due to Borel and Harish-Chandra states that an arithmetic subgroup in a semisimple Lie group is of finite covolume (the discreteness is obvious).

The theorem is more precise: it says that the arithmetic lattice is cocompact if and only if the &quot;form&quot; of formula_46 used to define it (i.e. the formula_27-group formula_2) is anisotropic. For example, the arithmetic lattice associated to a quadratic form in formula_4 variables over formula_7 will be co-compact in the associated orthogonal group if and only if the quadratic form does not vanish at any point in formula_65.

=== Margulis arithmeticity theorem ===

The spectacular result that Margulis obtained is a partial converse to the Borel—Harish-Chandra theorem: for certain Lie groups &quot;any&quot; lattice is arithmetic. This result is true for all irreducible lattices in semisimple Lie groups of real rank larger than two. For example, all lattices in formula_59 are arithmetic when formula_67. The main new ingredient that Margulis used to prove his theorem was the superrigidity of lattices in higher-rank groups that he proved for this purpose.

Irreducibility only plays a role when formula_46 has a factor of real rank one (otherwise the theorem always holds) and is not simple: it means that for any product decomposition formula_69 the lattice is not commensurable to a product of lattices in each of the factors formula_70. For example, the lattice formula_71 in formula_72 is irreducible, while formula_73 is not.

The Margulis arithmeticity (and superrigidity) theorem holds for certain rank 1 Lie groups, namely formula_74 for formula_75 and the exceptional group formula_76. It is known not to hold in all groups formula_77 for formula_78 (ref to GPS) and for formula_79 when formula_80. There are no known non-arithmetic lattices in the groups formula_81 when formula_82.

=== Arithmetic Fuchsian and Kleinian groups ===

An arithmetic Fuchsian group is constructed from the following data: a totally real number field formula_16, a quaternion algebra formula_84 over formula_16 and an order formula_86 in formula_84. It is asked that for one embedding formula_88 the algebra formula_89 be isomorphic to the matrix algebra formula_90 and for all others to the Hamilton quaternions. Then the group of units formula_91 is a lattice in formula_92 which is isomorphic to formula_93 and it is co-compact in all cases except when formula_84 is the matrix algebra over formula_95 All arithmetic lattices in formula_96 are obtained in this way (up to commensurability).

Arithmetic Kleinian groups are constructed similarly except that formula_16 is required to have exactly one complex place and formula_84 to be the Hamilton quaternions at all real places. They exhaust all arithmetic commensurability classes in formula_99

=== Classification ===

For every semisimple Lie group formula_46 it is in theory possible to classify (up to commensurability) all arithmetic lattices in formula_46, in a manner similar to the cases formula_102 explained above. This amounts to classifying the algebraic groups whose real points are isomorphic up to a compact factor to formula_46.

=== The congruence subgroup problem ===
A congruence subgroup is (roughly) a subgroup of an arithmetic group defined by taking all matrices satisfying certain equations modulo an integer, for example the group of 2 by 2 integer matrices with diagonal (respectively off-diagonal) coefficients congruent to 1 (respectively 0) modulo a positive integer. These are always finite-index subgroups and the congruence subgroup problem roughly asks whether all subgroups are obtained in this way. The conjecture (usually attributed to Jean-Pierre Serre) is that this is true for (irreducible) arithmetic lattices in higher-rank groups and false in rank-one groups. It is still open in this generality but there are many results establishing it for specific lattices (in both its positive and negative cases).

== S-arithmetic groups ==

Instead of taking integral points in the definition of an arithmetic lattice one can take points which are only integral away from a finite number of primes. This leads to the notion of an &quot;formula_104-arithmetic lattice&quot; (where formula_104 stands for the set of primes inverted). The prototypical example is formula_106. They are also naturally lattices in certain topological groups, for example formula_106 is a lattice in formula_108

=== Definition ===

The formal definition of an formula_104-arithmetic group for formula_104 a finite set of prime numbers is the same as for arithmetic groups with formula_34 replaced by formula_112 where formula_113 is the product of the primes in formula_104.

=== Lattices in Lie groups over local fields ===

The Borel–Harish-Chandra theorem generalizes to formula_104-arithmetic groups as follows: if formula_13 is an formula_104-arithmetic group in a formula_7-algebraic group formula_2 then formula_13 is a lattice in the locally compact group

:formula_121.

== Some applications ==

=== Explicit expander graphs ===

Arithmetic groups with Kazhdan&#x27;s property (T) or the weaker property (formula_122) of Lubotzky and Zimmer can be used to construct expander graphs (Margulis), or even Ramanujan graphs (Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak). Such graphs are known to exist in abundance by probabilistic results but the explicit nature of these constructions makes them interesting.

=== Extremal surfaces and graphs ===

Congruence covers of arithmetic surfaces are known to give rise to surfaces with large injectivity radius. Likewise the Ramanujan graphs constructed by Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak have large girth. It is in fact known that the Ramanujan property itself implies that the local girths of the graph are almost always large.

=== Isospectral manifolds ===

Arithmetic groups can be used to construct isospectral manifolds. This was first realised by Marie-France Vignéras and numerous variations on her construction have appeared since. The isospectrality problem is in fact particularly amenable to study in the restricted setting of arithmetic manifolds.

=== Fake projective planes ===

A fake projective plane is a complex surface which has the same Betti numbers as the projective plane formula_123 but is not biholomorphic to it; the first example was discovered by Mumford. By work of Klingler (also proved independently by Yeung) all such are quotients of the 2-ball by arithmetic lattices in formula_124. The possible lattices have been classified by Prasad and Yeung and the classification was completed by Cartwright and Steger who determined, by computer assisted computations, all the fake projective planes in each Prasad-Yeung class.

==Coat of arms==
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Argent on a Mount Vert an Eagle displayed Sable beaked, langued and membered Gules.&quot;

==History==

Adelboden is first mentioned in 1409 as &quot;in valle Adelboden&quot;. In 1453, it was mentioned as &quot;Adelboden alias silva&quot;.

The alps Engstligenalp and Silleren belonging to Adelboden first appeared in historical records in the 13th century. The inhabitants of Engstligental are referred to as &quot;forest people&quot;. In the 15th century, Adelboden established its own church and there were over 50 house fathers vouching for the salary of the minister.

In the 16th century, when Adelboden joined the Reformation, the Catholic priest fled over the Hahnenmoospass to the Catholic Canton of Fribourg.

Prior to the 19th century, the primary method of reaching Frutigen was by travelling along the steep southern south slope of the Engstligen Valley, a journey that was often rendered impassable in winter months. However, in the late 19th century, a road was constructed along the river Entschlige, improving accessibility and connecting the town of Adelboden to the rest of the world.

In the 1870s the first boarding house was opened by one of the local teachers. Over time, it evolved into a hotel, which remains under the ownership of the same family (known as Hotel Hari im Schlegeli). This was accompanied by a significant increase in the town&#x27;s population, thanks to the influx of tourists around the turn of the century.

Adelboden was the destination of the first packaged winter sports holidays (vacations), organised by Sir Henry Lunn in 1903.

Into the 1930s the aerial ropeway to the Engstligenalp was built with further ropeways following. The Silleren area was up into the 1980s accessible by buses.

===World War Two===

During World War Two, Adelboden was an internment camp with converted chalets and hotels used to house internees. Adelboden was chosen because it was isolated, surrounded by mountains and so relatively hard to escape from. The US Government paid the local hotels for the internees&#x27; room and board. 

Internees included British, German, Polish, Russian, Czech, and French combatants. American internees named the area “Camp Maloney” after the first American internee to die.

<text>Padiham ( ) is a market town and civil parish on the River Calder, in the Borough of Burnley in Lancashire, England. It is located north west of Burnley, and north east of the towns of Clayton le Moors and Great Harwood. It is edged by the foothills of Pendle Hill to the north-west and north-east. The United Kingdom Census 2011 gave a parish population of 10,098, estimated in 2019 at 10,138.

==History==
Early forms of the name include &quot;Padingham&quot;, with the last element probably from the Old English word , meaning home and in this sense meaning &quot;of the&quot;. Its first is generally thought to be a personal name: Bede listed Padda as one of the priests who assisted Bishop Wilfrid in the late 7th century.

No prehistoric or Roman sites have been found in the built-up area. Padiham, though a name of Anglo-Saxon origin, is not recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book. Padiham was never a separate manor, its lands largely being held by copyhold tenants of the Manor of Ightenhill, a part of the Honour of Clitheroe. In 1258 there was a single free tenant, one Gilbert de Padiham. The Lord of Clitheroe had established a water-powered corn mill here by 1311. It remained for centuries as a market town, where produce from Pendleside was bought and sold. The town expanded and was redeveloped during the Industrial Revolution. The centre is now a conservation area.

Padiham&#x27;s population peaked around 1921 at about 14,000, declining to 10,000 in the early 1960s and 8,998 at the time of the 2001 census. This reflected how people were moving to the south of England in search of work, after the decline in the traditional cotton, coal and engineering manufacturing industries.

Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip first visited Burnley, Nelson and the old Mullard valve factory at Simonstone near Padiham on their post-Coronation tour of Lancashire in 1955.

==Governance==
Padiham, once a township in the parish of Whalley, became a civil parish in 1866. An urban district covered the town from 1894 until 1974, but over this time, some rural areas mainly to the north became a new civil parish, Northtown, as part of Burnley Rural District. The Padiham Green area, hitherto part of Hapton, joined Padiham, with another small area following in 1935. Since 1974 Padiham has formed part of the Borough of Burnley. Initially part of an unparished area, a new Padiham civil parish was formed in late 2001, covering a similar area to the old urban district. A Town Council was instituted in 2002. Further boundary changes in 2004 saw the parish gain more territory in the south from Hapton.

Councillors for Padiham on Burnley Borough Council are elected to the Gawthorpe Ward, which covers most of Padiham, but not Gawthorpe Hall, with southern and eastern areas covered by Hapton with Park Ward. The two wards each elect three councillors, John Harbour and Alun Lewis of the Labour Party and Karen Ingham (Conservative) currently serving Gawthorpe and Joanne Broughton, Alan Hosker, and Jamie McGowan, all of the Conservatives in Hapton with Park. The parish is represented on Lancashire County Council as part of the Padiham &amp; Burnley West division, represented since 2017 by Alan Hosker. The Parliamentary Constituency, Burnley, is currently represented by Oliver Ryan for the Labour Party.

==Demography==
According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, the parish had a population of 10,098, an increase from 8,998 in the 2001 census. The town forms part of a wider urban area, which had a population of 149,796 in 2001. A similar but larger, Burnley Built-up area defined in the 2011 census had a population of 149,422.

The racial composition of the town in 2011 was 98.1% White (96.6% White British), 1.1% Asian, 0.1% Black, 0.5% Mixed and 0.1% Other. The largest religious groups were Christian (70.0%) and Muslim (0.6%). 68.3% of adults between the ages of 16 and 74 were classed as economically active and in work.

==Economy==
In the 19th century, Padiham&#x27;s industry was based on coal-mining and weaving. Helm Mill on Factory Lane was the first mill built in 1807. By 1906 there were twenty cotton mills though the best preserved, now converted into flats, is Victoria Mill in Ightenhill Street, built in 1852–1853 and extended in 1873. Many cotton workers belonged to the Padiham Weavers&#x27; Association, whose membership peaked in 1907 at over 6,000.

Industrial development was helped by proximity to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, about to the south. By 1848, Padiham had many coal pits around the town, including two large collieries and a number of smaller workings. Availability of coal and water nearby helped to boost the cotton industry. Industry benefited further from the arrival of the railway at Hapton in 1840 and Padiham itself in 1877. The last pit closed about 1870, although mining continued in areas outside the town into the 1950s, and open cast mining took place in the 1960s east of the town close to Gawthorpe Hall, north of the River Calder off Grove Lane.

Since the 1960s, the remaining cotton mills have continued a decline that began in the 1930s. So too has Padiham&#x27;s role as a manufacturing base since the 1990s. The town&#x27;s last major employer in the sector, Baxi, closed its factory in March 2007, with a loss of 500 jobs. A modern business park, &quot;Shuttleworth Mead&quot;, opened in 2001 on the western edge of the town where Padiham Power Station had stood until 1993. The business park has been supported by £2.2 million from the European Regional Development Fund and £2 million from the North West Development Agency. Tenants include Supanet, an internet service provider (ISP) and Graham &amp; Brown, a wall coverings company.

In 2007 Fort Vale Engineering developed a new purpose-built factory, where the old Mullard/Philips site at Calder Vale Park, Simonstone had closed in 2004. Fort Vale Engineering employs some 280 local people and has brought business to other local employers.

==Landmarks==
There are five significant mansions in the local area: Huntroyde Hall, dating from 1576, and Simonstone Hall, dating from 1660, in nearby Simonstone, are still privately owned. Gawthorpe Hall was donated to the National Trust in 1970, but is jointly managed with Lancashire County Council under a 99-year lease. Gawthorpe is in the Ightenhill district. 
The National Trust also runs an office and a tearoom in the courtyard of the property. Gawthorpe was owned by the Shuttleworth family, which held Shuttleworth Hall near Hapton from the 12th century. The current building dates from 1639 and is still a working farm. Read Hall and Park is in the nearby village of Read, about west of Padiham on the A671.
St Leonard&#x27;s Parish Church dates from 1866 to 1869 and is a Grade II listed building. It occupies the site of earlier churches dating back to 1451 or earlier. The original churchyard was smaller in extent than today, being expanded to the northern edge in 1835.

Padiham Town Hall in Burnley Road, built in 1938 to designs by Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope, is a Grade II listed building.

Padiham Memorial Park at the top of Church Street, was designed by Thomas Mawson, a prolific landscape designer. It was officially opened in 1921 as a memorial to those of the town who gave their lives in the First World War. It now commemorates victims of the Second World War as well.

The park covers on two sites divided by the River Calder. The upper section is mainly formal, dominated by Knight Hill House, currently used as an Age UK (formerly Age Concern) day centre, and has a rose garden, lawns and two memorials. The lower section, off Park Street, has two bowling greens, tennis courts, skate park and Padiham Leisure Centre. The park is a Green Flag award winner. The park still had remains of some Second World War air raid shelters in 2008.

Another locally listed building is the former Padiham Building Society headquarters. A detached building over two storeys with large underground vault on Burnley Road, constructed between 1955-1958 and officially opened in 1959. The building was recently renovated by local businessman Liam Veitch and converted into individual office spaces.

Padiham War Memorial itself is at the main park entrance in Blackburn Road. There is a second memorial at All Saints&#x27; with St John the Baptist off the A671, Padiham Road, opposite the George IV pub. A local man, Thomas Clayton, funded the park in his will; public subscription provided additional money for the park&#x27;s many features.

Near the war memorial, the Air Crash Memorial recalls several local young people killed on 3 July 1970, when a Dan Air de Havilland Comet deviated from its course and crashed into the high ground of the Montseny Range in north-eastern Spain – see: Dan-Air Flight 1903. The aircraft, destroyed on impact and by subsequent ground fire, contained three flight crew, four cabin crew and 105 passengers, all of whom died. It was the airline&#x27;s first fatal accident involving fare-paying passengers. The tour operator, Clarksons Holidays, was at the time Britain&#x27;s largest package holiday company.

Several other buildings in the area are also of historic interest. Hargrove can be seen from a public footpath off the Padiham by-pass just north of the town and the 1950s council housing estate north of Windermere Road. For over 400 years it was the home of the Webster family of yeoman farmers. The house is probably 17th century and part of the Huntroyed estate. Coal from a local outcrop heated the house for many years. Stockbridge House in Victoria Road was occupied by the Holts, a farming family, in 1802 and has a Jacobean chimney. High Whitaker Farm is north-east of Hargrove, accessible by public footpath from Higham Road and from Grove Lane. The building is 16th century and said to have been used to hide Catholics during the reign of Henry VIII. Other houses of note are Priddy Bank Farm and Foulds House Farm, both off Sabden Road, and Arbory Lodge on Arbory Drive.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter and the local relay TV transmitter located in the Forest of Pendle.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lancashire, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Central Radio North West, Greatest Hits Radio Lancashire and Capital Manchester and Lancashire (formerly 2BR).

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Burnley Express&quot; and &quot;Lancashire Telegraph&quot;.

Between 1994 and 1996 three series of the BBC One comedy drama series &quot;All Quiet on the Preston Front&quot; was filmed in the town as the show&#x27;s fictional setting of Roker Bridge.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Padiham railway station was on a branch line (known as the Great Harwood loop) of the East Lancashire Line from Burnley to Blackburn. It opened in 1877, but was closed on 2 December 1957 and the station later demolished. The line was retained for deliveries of coal to Padiham Power Station until that closed in 1993. The nearest railway station now is at Hapton, about south. The old line was converted into a footpath/bridleway/cycleway called Padiham Greenway, completed in June 2010.

===Buses===
The town is served by Burnley Bus Company services from Accrington, Burnley, Nelson, Colne and beyond, and by a Blackburn Bus Company service 152 from Burnley, Blackburn and Preston.

===Road===
Junctions 8 and 10 of the M65 are both some from the town centre. Junction 8 of the M65 also gives access to the A56 dual carriageway leading to the M66 and access to the Manchester motorway network.

===Air===
The nearest airport, Manchester, is 50 minutes&#x27; drive. The best route by public transport is via Blackburn, then train. It takes some 2¼ hours.

==Historic maps==
The 1845 map (1) shows the town of Padiham in the early days of the Lancashire cotton industry in Victorian times, with three mills marked. Most of the town at that stage was north of the river. The top left-hand corner shows part of the Huntroyde Demesne. The River Calder, on the right of the map, flows to the north, having been diverted in the early 19th century from its original route, away from Gawthorpe Hall (shown in pink), because of pollution. In the 1960s the river was re-routed to its original course to accommodate open-cast coal mining.

The 1890 Ordnance Survey map (2) shows the cotton-industry growth of the cotton industry in the later 19th century. The 1–25,000 scale OS map (3) is a partial extract from the two maps indicated. Several historic locations shown include Read Hall (A2) and Read (B2); Martholme, just east of Martholme Viaduct (A3); Simonstone and Simonstone Hall (C3); Huntroyd and grounds (D1–D2); Padiham Power Station (D3) with the connecting line for fuel; post-war housing north of the town off Slade Lane (E2); High Whitaker (F1); the River Calder on the old course from Gawthore Hall and grounds (F2); Pendle Hall (G1); Ightenhill Manor House (G2); and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Burnley (J1). The railway line through Padiham also appears.

<text>Richard Cementarius (a.k.a. Richard the Mason) was a 13th-century Scottish architect and became the first Provost of Aberdeen in 1272. He held the title of &quot;Kings Master Mason&quot; to King Alexander III of Scotland.

He is believed to have designed the old tower of Drum Castle and is known to be the architect of the nearby Brig o&#x27; Balgownie, both of which contain distinctive pointed arches characteristic of his work.

<doc id="630757" wikidata="Q1359955" url="?curid=630757" title="Internet Connection Sharing">
<text>Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is a Windows service that enables one Internet-connected computer to share its Internet connection with other computers on a local area network (LAN). The computer that shares its Internet connection serves as a gateway device, meaning that all traffic between other computers and the Internet go through this computer. ICS provides Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and network address translation (NAT) services for the LAN computers.

ICS was a feature of Windows 98 SE and all versions of Windows released for personal computers thereafter.

== Operation ==
ICS routes TCP/IP packets from a small LAN to the Internet. ICS provides NAT services, mapping individual IP addresses of local computers to unused port numbers in the sharing computer. Because of the nature of the NAT, IP addresses on the local computer are not visible on the Internet. All packets leaving or entering the LAN are sent from or to the IP address of the external adapter on the ICS host computer.

Typically, ICS can be used when there are several network interface cards installed on the host computer. In this case, ICS makes an Internet connection available on one network interface to be accessible to one other interface that is explicitly designated as the private network. ICS can also share dial-up (including PSTN, ISDN and ADSL connections), PPPoE and VPN connections.

Starting with Windows XP, ICS is integrated with UPnP, allowing remote discovery and control of the ICS host. It also has a Quality of Service Packet Scheduler component. When an ICS client is on a relatively fast network and the ICS host is connected to the Internet through a slow link, Windows may incorrectly calculate the optimal TCP receive window size based on the speed of the link between the client and the ICS host, potentially affecting traffic from the sender adversely. The ICS QoS component sets the TCP receive window size to the same as it would be if the receiver were directly connected to the slow link. ICS also includes a local DNS resolver in Windows XP to provide name resolution for all network clients on the home network, including non-Windows-based network devices.

When connected to a Windows domain, the computer can have a Group Policy to restrict the use of ICS, but when at home, ICS can be enabled.

== Limitations ==

The service is not customizable in terms of which addresses are used for the internal subnet, and contains no provisions for bandwidth limiting or other features. ICS was initially designed to connect only to Windows computers: computers on other operating systems required different steps to utilize ICS. On Windows XP, the server, by default, gets the IP address 192.168.0.1. (This default can be changed within the interface settings of the network adapter or in the Windows Registry.) It provides NAT services to the entire 192.168.0.x subnet, even if the address on the client was set manually, not by the DHCP server. Since Windows 7, the 192.168.137.x subnet has been used by default.

==Alternatives==
Alternatives to ICS include hardware home routers and Wireless access points with integrated Internet access hardware, such as broadband over power lines, WiMAX or DSL modems.

<text>Allmendingen bei Bern is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. Besides the village of Allmendingen, the municipality includes the settlement of Märchligen.

== History ==
Allmendingen is first mentioned in 1256 as &quot;Alwandigen&quot; under the control of Rudolf von Alwandingen.

Until the end of 1992, Allmendingen was a part of Rubigen, which it separated from on 1 January 1993 to become a separate municipality.

Some traces of a prehistoric settlement and High Medieval fortifications were discovered in the Hüenliwald. The fortifications were abandoned by 1256, when the village was first mentioned. During the High Medieval period, Allmendingen Castle was built in the village. The castle was later abandoned and fell into ruin. The ruins were still visible in the village in 1729, but have since vanished.

In 1256 the Lords of Allmendingen sold both Allmendingen and the village of Märchligen to Interlaken Monastery. In 1528, the city of Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and began imposing it on the Bernese Oberland. The monastery and its villages rose up in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the monastery, they secularized it and annexed all its lands, including Allmendingen.

Starting in the 17th century, Bernese patricians, trying to escape the city, built country manor houses in Allmendingen. These included the 1607 Neue Schloss for Kaspar von Graffenrieds and the 1723 Märchligen Estate for Samuel Morlot, both of which were used as summer residences. Other nobles built country estates and became gentleman farmers, including the Alter Sandacker estate (which was built before 1794) and the Hübeli estate from 1846.

During the early 20th century agriculture remained the major source of income in the village, while Bern grew around the village. In 1972 a number of zoning restrictions were lifted which finally allowed new construction. The municipality is located outside Bern but has easy access to the city along the old Bern-Thun highway, the Bern-Thun railway line from 1859, the Bern-Langnau-Lucerne railway from 1864 to 1875 and the A6 motorway which was built in 1973.

<text>Newfoundland () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) covering portions of both West Milford in Passaic County, and Jefferson Township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located along Route 23 and is the mailing address of Green Pond, a private lake in Rockaway Township. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 1,145.

Newfoundland was a popular resort destination at the turn of the 20th century. Several resort hotels including Brown&#x27;s Hotel and Idylease Inn relied on the railroad to bring guests for the resort season. The New Jersey Midland Railway developed the Newfoundland station in 1872. New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway provided passenger service until the 20th century and still travels through the area carrying freight. The 2003 independent film &quot;The Station Agent&quot; was set and filmed largely in Newfoundland, with the train station featured in the film.

Newfoundland is also the home of a nationwide food waste program called AmpleHarvest.org, which was launched in 2009 to end hunger and food waste by helping millions of gardeners nationwide donate excess food to thousands of local food pantries. The program came out of a local program that started donating food from its community garden to food pantries in Newfoundland and other nearby areas.

<doc id="630765" wikidata="Q1318011" url="?curid=630765" title="Indian scimitar babbler">
<text>The Indian scimitar babbler (Pomatorhinus horsfieldii) is an Old World babbler. It is found in peninsular India in a range of forest habitats. They are most often detected by their distinctive calls, which include an antiphonal duet by a pair of birds. They are often hard to see as they forage through dense vegetation. The long, curved yellow, scimitar-shaped bills give them their name. It has been treated in the past as a subspecies of the white-browed scimitar babbler which is found along the Himalayas but now separated into two species, the peninsular Indian species and the [[Sri Lanka scimitar babbler]] (&quot;Pomatorhinus melanurus&quot;).

==Description==

The most distinctive feature of this 22 cm long bird is the long down-curved yellow bill which is blackish at the base of the upper mandible. It has a striking head pattern, with a long white supercilium above a broad black band through the eye. The white throat and breast contrast with the dark greyish brown on the upperside and dark grey to black on most of the underside. The tail is broad, long and graduated. They have short, round wings and being weak fliers are rarely seen flying in the open.

Indian scimitar-babblers have long down-curved yellow bills, used to work through the leaf litter and bark in search of their food which is mainly insects and berries. They can be difficult to observe in the dense vegetation they prefer, but like many other babblers, these are noisy birds, and the characteristic bubbling calls are often the best indication that these birds are present. The call itself consists of a loud fluty &quot;oop-pu-pu-pu&quot; followed immediately by a &quot;krukru&quot;. The second note is produced by the female and the duet is accurately synchronized. Leucistic plumages have been recorded.

==Distribution==

It is the only scimitar babbler in Peninsular India. This species is found south of a line between Rajasthan and Orissa.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Old World babblers are a large family of passerine birds characterised by soft fluffy plumage. They are birds of tropical areas, with the greatest variety in southeast Asia. This species is very close to the Sri Lanka scimitar babbler which has in the past been treated as a subspecies. In the past, this species has been considered as a subspecies of the white-browed scimitar babbler (&quot;Pomatorhinus schisticeps&quot;) which is found along the Himalayan foothills. Molecular studies confirm this relatedness.

There are several races that have been noted, race &quot;travancoreensis&quot; is found in the Western Ghats south of Goa and is darker (see Gloger&#x27;s rule). The nominate &quot;horsfieldii&quot; is found in the plains in the southern part of the peninsula. The race &quot;obscurus&quot; of the dry zone in the northwest (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat; possibly Orissa) is lighter and greyer. Race &quot;maderaspatensis&quot; of the Eastern Ghats is intermediate in plumage between the nominate form and &quot;obscurus&quot;. Race &quot;maderaspatensis&quot; lacks the black base to the upper mandible and the bill is shorter. It has been recorded from the Palkonda Hills, Nallamalai Hills, Kurumbapatti and Shevaroy Hills.

The Sri Lankan form that was considered as a subspecies, &quot;melanurus&quot;, has been elevated to a full species by some works that note the geographic isolation and distinctive calls. The Sri Lankan form, however, responds to playback of the call of the Indian form.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Indian scimitar babbler is a resident breeder (non-migratory) bird. Its habitat is forest and secondary growth mainly in the hilly regions. They feed on insects on the ground or on vegetation. Hopping on the ground, they may turn over leaves or probe in leaf litter for prey. They may sometimes join mixed-species foraging flocks.

They breed from December to May. The nest is a large and loose globular mass of foliage concealed in a bush on the ground or low down. They usually lay three eggs (but varies from two to four) which are pure white in colour.

<text>HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; was the lead ship of her class of three battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy during the first decade of the twentieth century and the first battlecruiser to be built by any country in the world. During the First World War, she participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in a minor role, as she was the oldest and slowest of the British battlecruisers present. During the Battle of the Falkland Islands, &quot;Invincible&quot; and her sister ship sank the armoured cruisers and almost without loss to themselves, despite numerous hits by the German ships.

She was the flagship of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron during the Battle of Jutland in 1916. The squadron had been detached from Admiral Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet a few days before the battle for gunnery practice with the Grand Fleet and acted as its heavy scouting force during the battle. She was destroyed by a magazine explosion during the battle after the armour of one of her gun turrets was penetrated.

==Design and description==
&quot;Invincible&quot; was significantly larger than her armoured cruiser predecessors of the . She had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of at deep load. She displaced at load and at deep load, nearly more than the earlier ships.

The &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ships were formally known as armoured cruisers until 1911 when they were redesignated as battlecruisers by an Admiralty order of 24 November 1911. Unofficially a number of designations were used until then, including cruiser-battleship, dreadnought cruiser and battle-cruiser.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Invincible&quot; had two paired sets of Parsons turbines, each of which was housed in a separate engine-room and drove an outboard and inboard shaft. The high-pressure ahead and astern turbines were coupled to the outboard shafts and the low-pressure turbines to the inner shafts. A cruising turbine was also coupled to each inner shaft; these were not used often and were eventually disconnected. Her three-bladed propellers were in diameter on the inner shafts while the outer propellers were in diameter. The turbines were powered by thirty-one Yarrow water-tube boilers in four boiler rooms, and were designed to produce a total of , but reached nearly during trials in 1908. She was designed for , but reached during trials.

&quot;Invincible&quot; carried of coal, and an additional of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full fuel capacity, she could steam for at a speed of . Her electrical power was provided by four 200 kW turbo-generators and motor generators with capacity of 100 kW.
===Armament===
&quot;Invincible&quot; carried eight BL Mk X guns in four twin turrets. For evaluation purposes these were electrically driven BIX and BX turrets, two each built by Vickers and Armstrongs. They proved to be a failure despite two lengthy refits in 1909 and 1911 and were converted to hydraulic power during her refit in early 1914 at a cost of £151,200. The situation was so bad during her gunnery trials in October 1908 that the captain of , the Royal Navy&#x27;s chief gunnery school, described their operation in the following manner: &quot;When the order was given to train the turret, elevate or run a gun in or out, it was only necessary to push a button, or move a switch, but the result was often a flash of blue flame which seemed to fill the turret.&quot;

Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen QF Mk III guns. During 1915 the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve. All of the remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action. Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun on a high-angle MkII mount at the aft end of the superstructure that was carried between October–November 1914 and from April 1915 onwards. A 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun on a high-angle MkIc mounting with a maximum elevation of 60° was also mounted in November 1914. Five 18 in (450 mm) submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the &quot;Invincible&quot;s, two on each side and one in the stern. Fourteen torpedoes were carried for them.

===Armour===
The waterline belt was 6 inches thick roughly between the fore and aft 12-inch gun turrets, but was reduced to four inches from the fore turret to the bow, and did not extend aft of the rear turret. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour, except for the turret roofs which used of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC). The thickness of the main deck was and the lower deck armour was . Mild steel torpedo bulkheads of 2.5-inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms.

==Construction and career==

The ship was built at Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd on Tyneside. She was laid down on 2 April 1906, and launched at 15:00 on 13 April 1907 by Lady Allendale. On 28 December 1907, while still fitting out, she was hit by the Swedish collier &quot;Oden&quot;, which resulted in the buckling of beams and frames in the hull and five bottom plates being stove in. She was officially completed on 16 March 1909. On 18 March, she sailed from the Tyne to Portsmouth, where she would be commissioned. On the way, she collided with the brigantine &quot;Mary Ann&quot;, and stood by until the lifeboat &quot;John Birch&quot; arrived from Yarmouth to take the brigantine in tow.

She was commissioned into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 and participated in fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 in an attempt to cure the electrical problems with her turrets, but they were still unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power. This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet in August 1913. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled the fault of the submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle-worthy.

===First World War===
Her refit at Portsmouth Dockyard began in March 1914 and was interrupted by the declaration of war on Germany on 4 August. She&#x27;d been formally recommissioned the day prior, but the turret work required another week to complete. &quot;Invincible&quot; was the first battlecruiser to be fitted with a new fire-control director, but this could not be completed in the allotted time and would remain inoperable until she was refitted after the Battle of the Falkland Islands. She was declared operational on 12 August, when Rear-Admiral Sir Archibald Gordon Moore, commanding the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron, hoisted his flag in her. He was ordered to the Humber, along with the battlecruiser , where he could better support the British ships patrolling the Broad Fourteens.

====Battle of Heligoland Bight====

&quot;Invincible&quot;″s first action was as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight operation on 28 August 1914. Beatty&#x27;s ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade estuary. The brand-new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. &quot;Strassburg&quot; was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but &quot;Cöln&quot; remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. Beatty was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser directly to his front. He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at close range (under ). At 13:10, Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. At this time, &quot;Invincible&quot;, trailing the main body of battlecruisers, opened fire on &quot;Cöln&quot;. She fired 18 rounds, all misses, before Beatty&#x27;s main body encountered the crippled &quot;Cöln&quot; shortly after turning north and she was sunk by two salvos from .

====Battle of the Falklands====

The West Indies Squadron of Rear-Admiral Christopher Cradock was destroyed by the German East Asia Squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee during the Battle of Coronel on 1 November 1914. In response, the Admiralty ordered that a squadron be sent to destroy the Germans. The squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee, consisted of &quot;Invincible&quot; (flag) and &quot;Inflexible&quot;. They departed on 11 November and rendezvoused with several other cruisers under Rear Admiral Stoddard at Abrolhos Rocks, off the coast of Brazil on the 26th. They departed the following day and reached Port Stanley in the Falklands on the morning of 7 December.

Spee, making a leisurely voyage back to the Atlantic, wanted to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley and sent the armoured cruiser and the light cruiser to see if the harbour was clear of British warships on the morning of 8 December. They were spotted at 07:30, although the pre-dreadnought , grounded in Stanley Harbour to defend the town and its wireless station, did not receive the signal until 07:45. Sturdee was not expecting an engagement and most of his ships were coaling – and hence temporarily defenceless. The armoured cruiser and the light cruiser had one or both of their engines under repair. The armed merchant cruiser &quot;Macedonian&quot; was patrolling the outer harbour entrance while the armoured cruiser was anchored in the outer harbour, scheduled to relieve the &quot;Macedonian&quot; at 08:00. The German ships were not expecting resistance and the first salvo from &quot;Canopus&quot;″s guns at 09:20 caused them to sheer off from their bombardment of the wireless station and fall back on Spee&#x27;s main body.

Sturdee&#x27;s ships did not sortie from the harbour until 09:50, although they could see the retreating German ships on the southwest horizon. The &quot;Invincible&quot;s, fresh out of dry dock, had a advantage over Spee&#x27;s ships, which all had fouled bottoms that limited their speeds to no more than . The light cruiser lagged behind the other ships and &quot;Inflexible&quot; opened fire when the range dropped to at 12:55. &quot;Invincible&quot; opened fire shortly afterward and both ships began straddling &quot;Leipzig&quot; as the range closed to . At 13:20, Spee ordered his squadron to separate and ordered his light cruisers to turn to the southwest, while his armoured cruisers turned north east to cover their retreat. The German ships opened fire at 13:30 and scored their first hit at 13:44 when struck &quot;Invincible&quot;, though the shell burst harmlessly on the belt armour. Both sides fired rapidly during the first half-hour of the engagement, before Sturdee opened up the distance to put his ships outside the effective range of the German guns. British gunnery was very poor, scoring only four hits out of 210 rounds fired. The primary cause was the smoke from the guns and funnels, since the British were upwind of the Germans, though one gun of &quot;Invincible&quot;″s &#x27;A&#x27; turret jammed at 13:42 and was out of action for thirty minutes.
Spee turned to the south in an attempt to disengage while the British had their vision obscured, but only opened the range to before his course change was spotted. The British battlecruisers gave chase at . Forty minutes later, the British opened fire again at . Eight minutes later Spee turned again to the east to give battle. His strategy was to close the range so he could bring his secondary armament into play. He was successful and the 15 cm guns were able to open fire at 15:00 at maximum elevation. The smoke bothered both sides, but multiple hits were scored. Those of the German ships either failed to detonate or hit armoured areas. However, &quot;Gneisenau&quot;&#x27;s starboard engine room was put out of action. Sturdee ordered his ships at 15:15 to cross their own wakes to gain the windward advantage. Spee turned to the northwest, as if to attempt to cross the British T, but actually to bring &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s undamaged starboard guns to bear as most of those on his port side were now out of action. The British continued to hit &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; regularly and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; ceased fire at 16:00 before capsizing at 16:17 with no survivors. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had been slowed by earlier damage and was battered for another hour and a half by &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot; at ranges down to . Despite the damage her crew continued to fire back until she ceased firing at 16:47, her ammunition exhausted. Sturdee was ready to order &#x27;Cease fire&#x27; at 17:15 when an ammunition hoist was freed up and she made her last shot. The British then pounded her until 17:50, after her captain had given the order to scuttle her at 17:40. She slowly capsized at 18:00 and the British were able to rescue 176 men from the freezing waters. &quot;Invincible&quot; had fired 513 shells from her main guns during the battle, but had been hit twenty-two times. Two of her bow compartments were flooded, and one hit on her waterline abreast &#x27;P&#x27; turret had flooded a coal bunker and temporarily given her a 15° list. Nevertheless, only one man had been killed and five wounded aboard the battlecruisers.

After the battle, &quot;Invincible&quot; made temporary repairs at Port Stanley and headed for Gibraltar, where she could be drydocked for more permanent repairs. This took a month, and the opportunity was taken to extend the height of her fore funnel by to reduce the amount of smoke blocking visibility from the bridge and spotting top. &quot;Invincible&quot; sailed to England on 15 February 1915 and joined the Grand Fleet. On 21 February, the British battlecruiser force was organised into three squadrons of the Battlecruiser Fleet, with the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) that was to consist of the three &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ships once &quot;Inflexible&quot; arrived from the Mediterranean. She was refitted between 25 April and 12 May to have four worn-out 12-inch guns replaced and the secondary armament reduced and given casemates. Rear-Admiral Horace Hood took command of the 3rd BCS on 27 May 1915 and hoisted his flag in &quot;Invincible&quot;.

The 1st and 3rd BCS had sortied in response to the German bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April 1916, but failed to locate the German ships in heavy weather. During the return home, &quot;Invincible&quot; was rammed by the patrol yacht &quot;Goissa&quot; at 23:07. &quot;Goissa&quot;″s bow was embedded in &quot;Invincible&quot;″s side which partially stove-in. &quot;Invincible&quot;″s speed was reduced to through flooding and she was forced to haul out of line and proceed independently to Rosyth for repairs which lasted until 22 May 1916.

====Battle of Jutland====
At the end of May 1916, the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron was temporarily assigned to the Grand Fleet for gunnery practice. On 30 May, the entire Grand Fleet, along with Admiral Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, had been ordered to sea to prepare for an excursion by the German High Seas Fleet. In order to support Beatty, Admiral Hood took his three battlecruisers ahead of the Grand Fleet. At about 14:30, &quot;Invincible&quot; intercepted a radio message from the British light cruiser , attached to Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Force, reporting the sighting of two enemy cruisers. This was amplified by other reports of seven enemy ships steering north. Hood interpreted this as an attempt to escape through the Skagerrak and ordered an increase in speed to at 15:11 and steered East-Southeast to cut off the fleeing ships. Twenty minutes later, &quot;Invincible&quot; intercepted a message from Beatty reporting five enemy battlecruisers in sight and later signals reporting that he was engaging the enemy on a south-easterly course. At 16:06, Hood ordered full speed and a course of south-southeast in an attempt to converge on Beatty. At 16:56, with no British ships in sight, Hood requested Beatty&#x27;s course, position and speed, but never received a reply.

Hood continued on course until 17:40, when gunfire was spotted in the direction to which his light cruiser had been dispatched to investigate other gunfire flashes. &quot;Chester&quot; encountered four light cruisers of Hipper&#x27;s 2nd Scouting Group and was badly damaged before Hood turned to investigate and was able to drive the German cruisers away from &quot;Chester&quot;. At 17:53, &quot;Invincible&quot; opened fire on and the other two &quot;Invincible&quot;s followed two minutes later. The German ships turned for the south after fruitlessly firing torpedoes at 18:00 and attempted to find shelter in the mist. As they turned &quot;Invincible&quot; hit &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; in the engine room and knocked out her engines while &quot;Inflexible&quot; hit once. The 2nd Scouting Group was escorted by the light cruiser and 31 destroyers of the 2nd and 9th Flotillas and the 12th Half-Flotilla which attacked the 3rd BCS in succession. They were driven off by Hood&#x27;s remaining light cruiser and the five destroyers of his escort. In a confused action, the Germans only launched 12 torpedoes and disabled the destroyer with gunfire. Having turned due west to close on Beatty&#x27;s ships, the three &quot;Invincible&quot;-class battlecruisers were broadside to the oncoming torpedoes, but &quot;Invincible&quot; turned north, while &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; turned south to present their narrowest profile to the torpedoes. All the torpedoes missed, although one passed underneath &quot;Inflexible&quot; without detonating. As &quot;Invincible&quot; turned north, her helm jammed and she had to come to a stop to fix the problem, but this was quickly done and the squadron reformed heading west.
At 18:21, with both Beatty and the Grand Fleet converging on him, Hood turned south to lead Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers were 9,000 yards (8.2 km/5.1 mi) away and the &quot;Invincible&quot;s almost immediately opened fire on Hipper&#x27;s flagship and . &quot;Indomitable&quot; hit &quot;Derfflinger&quot; three times and &quot;Seydlitz&quot; once, while the &quot;Lützow&quot; quickly took 10 hits from , &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot;, including two hits below the waterline forward by &quot;Invincible&quot; that would ultimately doom her. At 18:30 &quot;Invincible&quot; abruptly appeared as a clear target before &quot;Lützow&quot; and &quot;Derfflinger&quot;. The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at &quot;Invincible&quot; and sank her in 90 seconds. At least one 305 mm (12-inch) shell from the third salvo struck her midships &#x27;Q&#x27; turret. The shell penetrated the front of &#x27;Q&#x27; turret, blew off the roof and detonated the midships magazines, which blew the ship in half. The explosion possibly ignited &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; magazines. Of her complement, 1026 officers and men were killed, including Rear-Admiral Hood. There were only six survivors picked up by the destroyer . Five of the six were stationed in the fore-control top located on the tripod foremast, including the gunnery officer Commander Hubert E. Dannreuther; the other man was stationed in the rangefinder atop &#x27;Q&#x27; turret itself. When the magazine exploded he was somehow thrown clear of the ship.

==Wreck site==
After the war, the &quot;Invincible&quot; was located by a Royal Navy minesweeper lying on a sandy bottom at a depth of at . The battlecruiser&#x27;s stern is right-side up and the bow upside-down.

Examination of the wreck has found that the 12 inch guns in the aft turret remain loaded although its roof is missing. A contemporary photograph of the explosion that destroyed &quot;Invincible&quot; shows flame and smoke erupting from &#x27;X&#x27; turret. Coupled with the aft turret&#x27;s missing roof, it implies that &#x27;X&#x27; magazine also caused a low-order explosion within the ship.

&quot;Invincible&quot; is a protected site under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. Mount Invincible in the Canadian Rockies was named after the battlecruiser in 1917.

<text>Sverre Sigurdsson () (c. 1145/1151 – 9 March 1202) was the king of Norway from 1184 to 1202.

Many consider him one of the most important rulers in Norwegian history. He assumed power as the leader of the rebel party known as the Birkebeiner in 1177, during their struggle against King Magnus Erlingsson. After Magnus fell at the Battle of Fimreite in 1184, Sverre ruled as sole king of Norway. Differences with the Church, however, led to his excommunication in 1194. Another civil war began against the church-supported Baglers, which lasted beyond Sverre&#x27;s death in 1202.

The most important historical source on Sverre&#x27;s life is his biography, the &quot;Sverris saga&quot;, in part written while Sverre was alive. This saga is likely biased, since the foreword states that part was written under Sverre&#x27;s direct sponsorship. Correspondence between the pope and the Norwegian bishops can be used as an alternate source when it comes to church affairs. The saga and the letters mostly agree about the hard facts.

Supposedly, King Sverre was short, so he usually directed his troops from horseback during battles. The contrast is great to the traditional Norse warrior ideals where the king was expected to lead his men from the front of the battle line. Sverre was a talented improviser, both in political and military life. His innovative tactics often helped the Birkebeiners against more tradition-bound opponents. During battle he had his men operate in smaller groups, while previously tactics similar to the shield wall had been preferred. This made the Birkebeiners more mobile and adaptable.

==Early life==
According to the saga, Sverre was born in 1151 to Gunnhild and her husband Unås, a comb maker from the Faroes. When Sverre was five, the family moved to the Faroes where Sverre was raised in the household of Unås&#x27; brother Roe, bishop of the Faroes on Kirkjubøargarður in Kirkjubøur. It was here that Sverre studied for the priesthood and was ordained. The priest school of Kirkjubøur must have been of a high standard, for Sverre was later described as very well educated. The legend says that he was hidden in a cave near the village. This cave actually exists and gave the mountain Sverrahola (303 m, &quot;Sverre&#x27;s cave&quot;) on the south tip of Streymoy its name.

Sverre, however, was not suited for a priestly life. The saga states that he had several dreams which he interpreted as a sign that he was destined for greater things. Further, in 1175, his mother revealed that Sverre was really the son of King Sigurd Munn. In the following year, Sverre travelled to Norway to seek his destiny.

===Paternity===
The tale told in Sverre&#x27;s saga is the official version. Historians have questioned the veracity of it, especially with regard to Sverre&#x27;s alleged paternity. Some historians have considered his claim to be King Sigurd&#x27;s son to be false, as did many of his contemporaries. Others have believed the paternal claim to be true, while most historians have found that the paternal question cannot be given a definite answer. Although the fact that kings fathered illegitimate sons was taken for granted, other facts indicate that Sverre was in his early thirties when he came to Norway, such as the age of his own sons and nephews. It has been cited against Sverre&#x27;s claim that according to Canon law, one had to be at least 30 years old to be eligible for the priesthood. If Sverre was 30 years old when he became a priest, this would place his birth no later than 1145, making his paternal claim impossible, as Sigurd Munn was born in 1133. This particular objection has lost credence as it has become clear that this age limit was routinely ignored in Scandinavia at the time. However, other objections remain, such as the fact that Sverre consistently refused to undergo an ordeal by fire to prove his claims. At the time, such a trial was routine for new claimants to the throne, and belief in its efficacy seems to have been universal; yet Sverre refused to undergo it. If Sverre&#x27;s claim was false, however, he would lack royal legitimacy, dooming his plans to failure. Regardless, his motivation is clear: to capture the throne of Norway, whether he could prove royal blood or not. After all, Norway had seen other claimants, since Harald Gille, whose paternity was equally questionable.

The fact that Sigurd Munn&#x27;s daughter Cecilia acknowledged Sverre as the son of Sigurd is inconclusive. Sverre&#x27;s actions offered her a welcome possibility to divorce from the marriage with Folkvid the Lawspeaker, into which she claimed to have been forced by Erling Skakke.

Support from Earl Birger Brosa of Sweden is more a sign of pragmatic politics on the part of the Swedes, as their ally party in Norway needed a new leader and had chosen Sverre. Sverre was not the Earl&#x27;s first choice, however. They had first supported Øystein Møyla, who had died at the Battle of Re in 1177. The Swedish dynastic lines were themselves engaged in civil war, and the current rulers of the family after King Erik were at war with the Danish king Valdemar. Erling Skakke had submitted to Valdemar some decades earlier, and it was beneficial for the Swedes at the time to support the opponents of Erling&#x27;s regime, namely Sverre.

===Norway in 1176===
In 1176, Norway was slowly recovering from decades of multiple civil wars. The causes were largely due to the lack of any clear succession laws. According to the old customs, all the king&#x27;s sons, legitimate or illegitimate, had equal right to the throne. It was customary for brothers to rule the kingdom together, but when quarrels arose, war was frequently the result.

Sigurd Munn, claimed by Sverre as his father, had been slain by his brother Inge Krokrygg in 1155. Sigurd&#x27;s son Håkon Herdebrei had been chosen to be king by his father&#x27;s followers. The conflict was now a regional conflict, with King Inge having the strongest support in Viken, while most of Håkon&#x27;s followers were from Trøndelag. Inge Krokrygg fell in 1161. His party then took the five-year-old Magnus Erlingsson as king. Magnus was the son of Erling Skakke and Kristin, daughter of King Sigurd the Crusader. In 1162, at the Battle of Veøy, Håkon Herdebrei fell and his faction began to fall apart. In 1164 Magnus was crowned by Archbishop Øystein Erlendsson. With the Church and most of the aristocracy on his side, Magnus&#x27; kingship seemed secure. Several uprisings followed, but they were all suppressed. Erling Skakke had been regent during his son&#x27;s minority and continued to be the country&#x27;s real ruler even after Magnus had come of age.

===Sverre meets the Birkebeiners===
Thus when Sverre came to Norway he found the prospects for a successful uprising to be small. Distraught, he travelled east and came to Östergötland in Sweden just before Christmas. There he met with the local ruler, Birger Brosa, who was married to Sigurd Munn&#x27;s sister, Brigit Haraldsdotter. Sverre revealed to Birger Brosa his claim to the throne, but Birger was at first unwilling to give any aid. He was already supporting another group, the Birkebeiners — the Birchlegs. This group had risen in 1174 under the leadership of Øystein Møyla who claimed to be the son of King Øystein Haraldsson. They had received the name Birkebeiners because their poverty led some of them to wind the bark of the birch about their legs, instead of wearing shoes. But in January 1177, the Birkebeiners met a crushing defeat at the Battle of Re and Øystein fell. Sverre met with the remnants in Värmland. After some initial doubts, Sverre let himself be persuaded to become the Birkebeiners&#x27; next leader.

==Rise to power==
Upon Sverre&#x27;s initial contact, the Birkebeiners had been reduced to a ragtag army of brigands and vagabonds with no more than 70 men, according to the saga. Many regard Sverre&#x27;s achievement of forging them into a force of skilled and professional soldiers as proof of his leadership qualities.

===Difficult years===
During the early years as leader of the Birkebeiners, Sverre and his men were almost constantly on the move. The Birkebeiners were generally viewed as troublemakers with little chance of success by the general populace, who most of all desired peace. Although peasant gatherings were no match for the battle hardened Birkebeiners, Magnus or Erling Skakke frequently had the Birkebeiner on the run.

In June 1177, Sverre first led his men to Trøndelag where Sverre was proclaimed as king at Øretinget. Since this was the traditional place to choose a king, the event carried important symbolic weight. The Birkebeiners then moved south to Hadeland, where they were forced northwards again. Sverre then decided to turn west, attempting to take Bergen by surprise. At Voss, however, the Birkebeiners were ambushed by the local peasants. Although the Birkebeiners were victorious, the surprise element on Bergen was eliminated, forcing the group eastwards again. After almost freezing to death on Sognefjell, they wintered in Østerdal.

The next spring, after a short stay in Viken, Sverre and the Birkebeiners returned to Trøndelag. The Birkebeiners now shifted to a more confrontational strategy. However, an attack on Nidaros ended in defeat at the Battle of Hatthammeren (&quot;Slaget på Hatthammeren&quot;). After fleeing south, they met Magnus&#x27; army in Ringerike, with the skirmish ending in a tactical victory for the Birkebeiners. Encouraged, the Birkebeiners returned to Trøndelag and managed to subdue the region enough to stay in Nidaros during the winter.

In the spring of 1179, Magnus and Erling Skakke attacked Nidaros, forcing another apparent retreat. Confident that the Birkebeiners had again fled southwards, Magnus and his men were complacent. Sverre, however, had turned around at Gauldal and marched again upon the city. The two armies met 19 June in the Battle of Kalvskinnet. Erling Skakke was killed in a battle that ended in a clear victory for Sverre. This victory secured Sverre&#x27;s hold on Trøndelag.

===Victory over the Heklungs===
After Sverre&#x27;s victory at Kalvskinnet, the war changed somewhat in character. The Trønders accepted Sverre as their king; the two sides were now much more equal in power. At some point, Magnus&#x27; party acquired the nickname Heklungs (&quot;Heklunger&quot;). &quot;Hekle&quot; is Old Norse for hood and is here probably meant to imply the traditional monk garb. 

Several battles now followed. Magnus Erlingsson again attacked Trøndelag in the spring of 1180, this time reinforced by conscripts from western Norway. But in the Battle of Ilevollene (&quot;Slaget på Ilevollene&quot;), just outside Nidaros, the Heklungs were again defeated and Magnus fled to Denmark. With Magnus out of the country, Sverre could sail south and occupy Bergen, but his hold on the region remained weak.

Determined to achieve a decisive victory against the Birkebeiners, Magnus returned with his fleet the next year. The two forces met at sea 31 May 1181 in the Battle of Nordnes. The battle ended in a tactical victory for the Birkebeiners; the Heklungs fled when Magnus was mistakenly believed to have been killed. With his men in poor shape, Sverre decided to withdraw to Trøndelag. Some attempts at negotiation were now made, but these soon broke down. Magnus would not accept Sverre as co-king with equal status, and Sverre could not accept becoming Magnus&#x27; vassal.

With Magnus controlling western Norway from his seat at Bergen, it became problematic for Sverre to keep his men supplied. Sverre therefore led his men south to Viken, a firm Heklung stronghold. He could therefore let his men plunder here with little damage to his cause. However, Magnus exploited Sverre&#x27;s absence well. In November he raided Trøndelag and managed to seize and burn the Birkebeiner fleet. Sverre had to return or risk losing his one secure foothold.

During summer 1182, Magnus made an attempt to take Nidaros by siege, but was repulsed with grave losses when the Birkebeiners launched a surprise night attack. Sverre now started an extensive shipbuilding program. Without a fleet, he could have no hopes of expanding his influence further south. In spring 1183 Sverre attacked Bergen with parts of his new fleet. Avoiding detection by the enemy scouts, he caught the Heklungs off guard, seizing their entire fleet. Magnus fled to Denmark, leaving crown and sceptre behind.

In the sea battles of medieval Scandinavia, the side with the largest and highest ships would usually have an advantage, since this meant the crew could attack the enemy from above with projectiles and other weapons. Sverre built the largest ship afloat at the time, the &quot;Mariasuda&quot;. Because of its great size, the seaworthiness of the &quot;Mariasuda&quot; was rather poor and it would only be useful within the narrow fjords. Either because of luck or good strategy such a situation would soon arise.

Early spring 1184, Magnus returned to Viken from Denmark with new ships. In April he sailed north towards Bergen. At about the same time, Sverre had gone to Sogn to put down a local uprising and was still there when Magnus came to Bergen in June. After chasing out the few Birkebeiners there, Magnus set sail again, having heard news of Sverre&#x27;s current position. The two fleets met 15 June at Fimreite in the long and narrow Sognefjord. The Battle of Fimreite proved to be the final struggle between Birkebeiners and Heklungs. Magnus had several large ships, but none as huge as the &quot;Mariasuda&quot;. While the &quot;Mariasuda&quot; held up half of the enemy fleet, the rest attacked the outlying enemy ships. Panic began to spread as the Heklungs fled aboard their larger ships. These ships soon became overloaded and began to sink. Many of the wounded and tired men could not keep themselves afloat and drowned, including King Magnus. Most of the Heklung leadership fell there, along with a huge number of men at both sides. Leaderless, the Heklungs were now broken as a political party. Sverre could now finally, after a six-year struggle, claim to be the sole and uncontested king of Norway.

==Troubled reign==
Now that the dissatisfied priest and his band of vagrants and outcasts had become king and rulers of Norway, Sverre worked to consolidate his power. He placed his loyal men in high positions (&quot;sysselmann&quot;) throughout the kingdom and negotiated marriage alliances between the old and new nobility. Sverre himself married the Swedish princess Margaret, daughter of Erik the Saint and sister of King Knut Eriksson of Sweden.

Although Norway had seen several conflicts in the previous decades, the victor had reconciled with his opponents. Reconciliation in Sverre&#x27;s case, however, proved to be difficult. It was a long war with more casualties than previous conflicts. Most of the older noble dynasties had lost men and thirsted for vengeance. Further, that many people of non-noble origin were now elevated to noble standing was difficult for many to accept. Peace was not to last long.

===Kuvlungs and Øyskjeggene===
Autumn 1185 the Kuvlungs (&quot;Kuvlungene&quot;) rose in Viken. Their leader, Jon Kuvlung, was a former monk and was claimed to be the son of Inge the Hunchback. This group was in many ways the direct successor of the Heklungs, with many of its members coming from former Heklung families. The Kuvlungs soon gained control of eastern and western Norway, the old Heklung strongholds.

In autumn 1186, the Kuvlungs attacked Nidaros. This offensive took Sverre by surprise; he took refuge in the recently constructed stone castle Sion. The Kuvlungs, unable to take the castle, were forced to retreat. In 1188 Sverre sailed south with a large fleet. They first met at Tønsberg, but neither side dared to offer battle. The Kuvlungs slipped away to Bergen. Sverre attacked Bergen just before Christmas. Jon Kuvlung was killed, which ended the Kuvlung rising. Some minor uprisings followed, but these never rose above banditry and were suppressed on a local scale.

The next serious threat came in 1193 with the Øyskjeggene (the Isle Beards). This group&#x27;s pretender to the throne was Sigurd, a child claimed to be the bastard son of Magnus Erlingsson. The real leader was Hallkjell Jonsson who was Magnus&#x27; brother-in-law. Conspiring with the earl of Orkney, Harald Maddadsson, Hallkjell gathered most of his men on the Orkney and Shetland Islands, hence the name of the group. After establishing themselves in Viken, the Øyskjeggene sailed on to Bergen. Although they occupied the city itself and the surrounding regions, a force of Birkebeiners held on in Sverresborg castle. In spring 1194 Sverre sailed south to confront the Øyskjeggene. The two fleets met 3 April in the Battle of Florvåg (&quot;slaget ved Florvåg&quot;). Here the battle experience of the Birkebeiner veterans proved to be decisive. Hallkjell fell with most of his men.

===Sverre and the church===

The Church of Norway had been organized under the Archbishopric of Nidaros in 1152. Øystein Erlendsson, who had become archbishop in 1161, had been one of Magnus Erlingsson&#x27;s main supporters. In return, the church had secured its position as an independent institution and also gained several other privileges.

Øystein had returned to Nidaros from England in 1183, and during his last years a state of truce existed between church and king. When Øystein died on 26 January 1188, Eirik Ivarsson, bishop of Stavanger, was elected as his successor. Sverre now probably hoped that his relationship with the church could be normalised. He therefore approached Eirik with hopes of being crowned — the definite proof of recognition. However, in Eirik&#x27;s eyes, Sverre was little more than a usurper and king-murderer.

The situation now escalated into an open breach as Sverre began building up a list of privileges that were contrary to the church law made by St. Olaf, the traditional founder of the Norwegian Church. Eirik on his side preached against the king and his men, and sent letters of complaint to the Pope, but in the short term his offensive weapons were few. In 1190 Sverre attempted to force the archbishop into submission, claiming that Eirik had broken the law by having 90 armed men in his service. According to law, the archbishop&#x27;s guard was limited to 30 men. Rather than submit to the king&#x27;s will, Eirik fled to Lund where the Danish archbishop had his seat. From there he sent a delegation to Rome asking the pope for advice.

With the archbishop absent, Sverre tightened his grip on the bishops, and on Nikolas Arnesson in particular. Nikolas was the half-brother of Inge Krokrygg and had become bishop of Oslo in 1190 against Sverre&#x27;s wish. After the destruction of the Øyskjeggs at Florvåg, Sverre arranged a meeting with Nikolas where he claimed to have proof that the bishop had colluded with the Øyskjeggs. The king accused Nikolas of treason and threatened severe punishment. Nikolas submitted, and on 29 June, together with the other bishops, he crowned Sverre. Sverre&#x27;s domestic priest was elected bishop of Bergen.

Meanwhile, archbishop Eirik had at last received a reply from Rome. In a letter dated 15 June 1194, Pope Celestine III laid out the foundational rights of the Norwegian Church supporting Eirik on every point. Empowered by this letter, Eirik could take the step of excommunicating Sverre and order the Norwegian bishops to join him in exile in Denmark.

The following spring, Sverre sent the still loyal Tore, bishop of Hamar, to Rome to plead his case before the pope. He returned in early 1197, according to the saga, carrying a papal letter which annulled the excommunication of Sverre. In Denmark, Tore is said to have fallen ill and died under suspicious circumstances, but not before pawning the papal letter. The pawnbrokers then travelled to Norway and delivered it to Sverre who used it for everything it was worth. No other sources confirm this story and most historians now agree that the letter was forged.

With the death of Pope Celestine in January 1198, the conflict entered a short lull until the new pope, Innocent III, had brought himself up to date, but then the conflict was further escalated. In October, Innocent III placed Norway under interdict and in letters to Eirik accused Sverre of forgery. He also sent letters to admonish neighboring kings to dispossess Sverre. They did the contrary: Sweden continued actively to support the Birkebeiners and John of England sent mercenaries to help Sverre. In 1200 Innocent found it necessary to warn the Archbishop of Canterbury not to accept further gifts from Sverre.

Around this time someone close to Sverre wrote a speech against the bishops, &quot;En tale mot biskopene&quot;. In this work, the unknown author discussed the relationship between King and Church. By referring to well known theological works such as the &quot;Decretum Gratiani&quot; and the writings of Augustine of Hippo, the author attempted to prove that the excommunication of Sverre was unjust and thus not binding. The author also tried to defend the right of Sverre to appoint bishops. To support this view he had to interpret Norwegian law, since the Church had long considered this to be simony. By now Sverre had his hands full with the church-supported Bagler rising, and the direct struggle with the church became a sideshow, at least for him personally.

==The Bagler war==
During spring 1196 the Bagler party was formed at Halør in Denmark in opposition against Sverre. Their leaders were Nikolas Arnesson, the nobleman Reidar Sendemann from Viken and Sigurd Jarlsson, a bastard son of Erling Skakke. Eirik the Archbishop also gave his support. As their king, they chose Inge Magnusson, supposedly the son of Magnus Erlingsson. They then sailed back to Norway.

Sverre happened to be in Viken, and the two forces soon encountered each other, although no major battles were fought. Sverre gave his eldest son, Sigurd Lavard, the responsibility of guarding a ballista he had had built. However, the Baglers launched a surprise night attack during which the ballista was destroyed and Sigurd and his men were chased away. Sverre was furious and never gave his son a command again. After some more indecisive fighting, Sverre sailed north to Trondheim, where he spent the winter. The Baglers had Inge hailed as king on Borgarting and soon established a firm control over the Viken region, with Oslo as their main seat.

In spring 1197, Sverre called out the leidang from the northern and western parts of the country, and in May he was able to sail south to Viken with more than 7000 men, a considerable force. The Birkebeiners attacked Oslo 26 July, and after many casualties on both sides, the Baglers were forced inland. Sverre now spent some time war-taxing the region, but with his leidang troops close to mutiny, Sverre withdrew to Bergen where he had decided to spend the winter. This was to be a near fatal mistake. The Baglers had meanwhile travelled north to Trøndelag by land where they had entered Nidaros with little opposition. The garrison at Sverresborg held fast for a while until their commander Torstein Kugad changed sides and let the Baglers into the castle. The Baglers had Sverresborg completely dismantled. Sverre&#x27;s home region was now in enemy hands.

The year 1198 was to be the nadir of Sverre&#x27;s fortunes. In May Sverre launched his attempt to recapture Trøndelag. This time Sverre failed to achieve surprise and the Birkebeiner fleet consisted mostly of smaller ships. In the sea battle that followed, the Birkebeiners were soundly beaten. In the aftermath of this battle the Baglers further consolidated their hold on Trøndelag and many went over to what they believed to be the winning side.

After his defeat, Sverre limped back to Bergen. He was soon followed by a numerically superior Bagler army under the leadership of Nikolas Arnesson and Hallvard of Såstad. Sverre continued to hold Bergenhus fortress. This castle proved to be impregnable, giving the Birkebeiners a secure base of operation. The following summer was to be called the &quot;Bergen&#x27;s summer&quot; and was dominated by indecisive skirmishing in the Bergen area. On 11 August the Baglers set fire to Bergen. The destruction was complete, even the churches were burnt down. Facing starvation, Sverre slipped away with most of his men to Trøndelag.

In Trøndelag, most of the population was still loyal to Sverre, and many of those who had joined the Baglers now changed sides again. Sverre was also able to play on the Baglers&#x27; brutality at Bergen. The Trønders promised to provide Sverre with a new fleet, in all 8 large ships were constructed and several transport ships were converted. The Baglers sailed into the Trondheimsfjord in early June. On 18 June 1199 the two fleets met at the Battle of Strindafjord (&quot;slaget på Strindfjorden&quot;). Here Sverre won a crushing victory, and the surviving Baglers fled to Denmark.

Sverre could now take control over Viken and prepared to spend the winter in Oslo, but the countryside remained largely hostile. Early the next year, a spontaneous uprising took place as huge numbers of people started drifting towards Oslo to throw the Birkebeiners out. This peasant army was untrained and without organization and was no match for the battle-hardened Birkebeiners. In a battle on 6 March 1200 the peasants were defeated piecemeal. However, the Birkebeiners&#x27; grip on the region was still weak, and Sverre decided to sail back to Bergen.

With Sverre gone, the Baglers could return in force from Denmark and soon they had re-established their hold on Eastern Norway. The two sides then spent a year raiding each other&#x27;s territories with no lasting gains for either side, although the Birkebeiners had the upper hand at sea.

In Spring 1201 Sverre sailed out from Bergen with a large leidang force in what would be his last campaign season. With this army he could demand war taxes without opposition on both sides of the Oslofjord during the summer. In September he set up camp at Tønsberg and laid siege to Tønsberg Fortress, which was garrisoned by Reidar Sendemann and his men. The siege dragged on because the other Bagler leaders dared not send a relief force and the garrison did not fall for any of Sverre&#x27;s tricks. At last, on 25 January, Reidar and his men surrendered, and Sverre decided to sail back to Bergen.

During the return journey Sverre fell ill, and by the time they reached Bergen, the king was dying. On his death bed, Sverre appointed his sole living son, Håkon, as his heir and successor and in a letter advised him to seek reconciliation with the Church. Sverre died 9 March 1202. He was buried in Christ Church, Bergen, which was destroyed in 1591.

<text>L&#x27;Île-Rousse (; , , or , ; , ; ) is a commune in the Haute-Corse department of France on the island of Corsica.

It was founded in 1758 by Pasquale Paoli to create a port that would not be in the hands of the Genoese (such as Calvi). As Italian was until 1848 the administrative language of Corsica, the town was originally named &quot;Isola Rossa&quot; (Red Island) from the eponymous reddish color of a rocky islet that served as a natural harbor.

Along with Saint-Florent and Tox, it is one of only three communes in the département to have a French name — all the others have kept their Italian names despite the repeated demands of Corsican nationalists to change the names of all communes to their native Corsican names.

==History==
Inhabited since very ancient times (between 5000-3000 BC), l&#x27;Île-Rousse was in 1000 BC a small, prosperous town called Agilla; it was dependent on Tyre in Phoenicia. Destroyed by the Phoenician fleet of Calaris (Galeria), Agilla came under Roman rule as Rubico Rocega (red rock) until the 4th century AD. Being so close to the sea, it was threatened by pirates and other potential enemies, and was not inhabited for several centuries except for fishermen and peasants who lived on the products of the sea and earth around the villages of Santa Reparata and Monticello.

In the 17th century, merchants from Santa-Reparata-di-Balagna established shops to trade by sea with the coastal villages of the Balagne, Nebbio, and the west of the Cap Corse. About 1759, Pasquale Paoli, who often came to Balagne, decided to equip Corsica with a port in the northwest of the island to try to cut the sea traffic between Genoa and Calvi. His plans prepared, he persuaded the Balagne government, sitting in Algajola, to authorize him to create a fort protecting the port (the Scalu) on 10 December 1765. L’Île-Rousse was born from this decision.

==Climate==
L&#x27;Île-Rousse has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;) closely bordering on a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). The average annual temperature in L&#x27;Île-Rousse is . The average annual rainfall is with November as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in February, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in L&#x27;Île-Rousse was on 5 July 1993; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 28 December 1996.

==Description==
Built on a bay bounded to the northwest by the rocky islets of red porphyry which give it its name, and to the south by an immaculate white sand beach, l’Île-Rousse is presented to the tourist in all its beauty, extending westwards from the sea to the hill of the Sémaphore and the col de Fogata.

The old town of Pascal Paoli, le Père de la Patrie (the Father of the Fatherland), is made up of paved streets, almost rectilinear and oriented north-south. From the quays of the commercial port installed on 3 of the 6 small islands, the fishing port and the bridges which link the harbor complex to the coast and the market with its twenty one columns, the fortifications and the houses of the old city grew over the years, from 1765 into the first half of the 19th century.

Certain houses with their interior Florentine staircases are remarkable. The first church built in 1740 and destroyed in 1936 gave its name to the rue Notre-Dame. The church dedicated to Notre Dame de Miséricorde is next to an old Franciscan convent, while the parish church of l’Île-Rousse, the Immaculée Conception de Marie, is on the west of the main square, with its enormous date palms (planted 1890) in the shade of which it is good to play a game of &quot;pétanque&quot;.

The new town blends harmoniously with the old at the place Paoli, shaded by hundred year old plane trees, where it is good to take the summer air. The old town offers visitors the chance to stroll on the old paving stones, partly restored, along streets with historic names: Pasquale Paoli, Napoleon, &quot;les frères&quot; Arena (Arena brothers), Louis Philippe, Agilla..

Built by Pascal Paoli, equipped by its municipal officials, after 1815 with a blazon decorated with the royal fleur-de-lis of France and run for than a half-century by elected Bonapartist officials, l’Île-Rousse is a town with a share in the history of Corsica. Its contradictions make it an attractive and unexpected place for the tourists who come each year to sit down under the plane trees of its beautiful central square.

<doc id="630785" wikidata="Q1630793" url="?curid=630785" title="Hotchkiss et Cie">
<text>Société Anonyme des Anciens Etablissements Hotchkiss et Compagnie was a French arms and, in the 20th century, automobile manufacturer first established by American gunsmith Benjamin B. Hotchkiss. He moved to France and set up a factory, first at Viviez near Rodez in 1867, manufacturing arms used by the French in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, then moving at Saint-Denis near Paris in 1875. It was merged into and succeeded by Thomson-CSF, now Thales Group.

==Arms==

An example of the company&#x27;s output was the Hotchkiss revolving cannon (see picture from a privately circulated book dated 1874 by Alfred Koerner, later chairman of the company). The cannon had five barrels each able to fire 43 shells a minute a distance of one mile; it was made in four sizes from 37 mm to 57 mm, the largest intended for naval use. At the turn of the twentieth century, the company introduced the gas-operated Hotchkiss machine gun, a sturdy and reliable weapon which was widely used during World War I and thereafter by the French Army.

At the start of the twentieth century the company started building cars. Information provided by the company for the International Universal Exhibition of 1900, at which it displayed a variety of cannons, said the St Denis factory employed around 400 staff and had 600 machine tools.

The first Hotchkiss car, a 17 CV four-cylinder model, appeared in 1903. The badge for the marque consisted of a pair of crossed cannons—a salute to the company&#x27;s first products.

A factory fire nearly killed all projects. Despite this, a six-cylinder model followed in 1906. During World War I, they mass-produced the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun, tank parts and other weapons. In 1933, they developed the Hotchkiss H35 tank.

In 1920, there was an unsuccessful attempt to build Hotchkiss cars by a British arm of Hotchkiss in the United Kingdom—only a prototype was made. The company made several successful racing cars. Hotchkiss racers won the Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo in 1932, 1933, 1934, 1939, 1949 and 1950.

The Hotchkiss 680 was an important model between the wars—it had a six-cylinder, 3-litre engine. In 1937, the company merged with Amilcar. J. A. Grégoire joined the company as a designer. After World War II, the 680 continued. The first new car post war was a 13 CV four-cylinder model. From 1947, two-litre flat-four models are frequently called Hotchkiss-Grégoire. In 1954, Hotchkiss purchased French manufacturer Delahaye, closing down their automotive line but continuing to produce Hotchkiss-Delahaye trucks for a few months before eliminating the Delahaye name completely. After 1954, Hotchkiss manufactured Jeeps under licence from Willys.

In 1956, Hotchkiss merged with French weapon manufacturer Brandt, producing jeeps at their factory near Paris for the French military until 1966. The firm was merged into Thomson-Houston in 1966 and in 1970 stopped producing vehicles. In the early 1970s, the Hotchkiss marque disappeared, as the French conglomerate came to be known as . This, in turn, was nationalized in 1982 to form Thomson SA.

== Tanks ==
The &quot;Char léger modèle 1935 H&quot;, Commonly known as the Hotchkiss H35 was a light tank produced by the company in the mid-1930s. Initially designed by Hotchkiss in 1933, it was put into service in 1936. An estimated 1,200 vehicles were built between September 1936 and June 1940, however it remained in service with multiple countries as late as 1952. Unlike many other vehicles of the time, the H35 was not made of riveted rolled homogenous armoured plates – rather, it was almost entirely cast iron. This gave it increased structural strength, especially against HE (high explosive) rounds. A spiritual successor to the Renault FT-17, the tank was intended for a very similar role: a cavalry tank, lightly armoured, nimble, and supported by infantry. For the time, it had formidable armour and proved combat effective against German armour during the Battle of France. It was almost entirely immune to frontal fire from the Panzer II and could only be effectively neutralised by more formidable Panzer IIIs and IVs. Due to a weak main armament, many Hotchkiss H35 tanks were converted into the Hotchkiss H39 – with a slightly more powerful 37mm cannon, a more powerful engine and slightly more armour on the turret. Several Hotchkiss tanks were captured by Nazi Germany and converted to Panzerjäger () assault guns.

==Hotchkiss drive==

The name of the Hotchkiss firm was given to a form of power transmission from a vehicle&#x27;s engine by shaft to the differential on its rear axle, which through leaf springs both locates the rear axle and transmits drive forces.

<text>The Shrewsbury River is a short stream and navigable estuary. The stream is approximately 8 mi (13 km) long and is located in Monmouth County in Central New Jersey.

It extends east-northeast from its head of navigation at Oceanport to its confluence with the Navesink River estuary, then entering 1 mi (1.6 km) north in a narrow channel to Sandy Hook Bay at Highlands. The south shore runs about the entire length of the northern border of Long Branch. The estuary is protected from the open Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side by a long barrier peninsula that extends north to become Sandy Hook. Jersey Shore resort communities on the peninsula include Monmouth Beach and Sea Bright. On the inner side of the estuary, the bedroom community of Rumson on the end of the peninsula, separating the Shrewsbury and Navesink estuaries, is among the wealthiest communities in the United States.

The estuary provides a popular marina for pleasure craft and recreational fishing. Marine species like Fluke (summer flounder), striped bass, bluefish and weakfish are popular fish targeted by local anglers. Many also participate in crabbing, or crab fishing.

<text>Maksim Mikalaevich &quot;Max&quot; Mirnyi (born 6 July 1977) is a Belarusian former professional tennis player.

Mirnyi became a doubles specialist following his singles career, in which he reached a career-high of World No. 18 (August 2003) and finished in the top 50 in the world for seven straight years despite only winning one ATP singles title (2003 Rotterdam Open). He represented Belarus in Davis Cup competition from April 1994, where he holds a record of 47 wins and 27 losses in 35 ties played. He reached the World No. 1 doubles ranking in June 2003 and won ten Grand Slam titles: Men&#x27;s doubles in the 2000 and 2002 US Open and the 2005, 2006, 2011 and 2012 French Open; and mixed doubles in the 1998, 2007, and 2013 U.S. Opens and 1998 Wimbledon.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Mirnyi carried the flag of Belarus at the Opening Ceremony on 27 July 2012, and won the gold medal in the mixed doubles with Victoria Azarenka on 5 August 2012.

His nickname is &quot;The Beast of Belarus&quot; 

==Career==
Mirnyi won the 1998 US Open and 1998 Wimbledon mixed doubles titles while partnering with Serena Williams, and lost the final of the 1999 Australian Open while partnering with her. His best performance at a Grand Slam in singles came when he got to the quarterfinals of the 2002 US Open, defeating Attila Sávolt, Antony Dupuis, Dominik Hrbatý and Roger Federer before losing to Andre Agassi. In the 2004 Davis Cup, he and Vladimir Voltchkov defeated Russia 3–2 and Argentina 5–0, reaching the semifinals, where they lost to the United States. In 2006, he scored an upset against James Blake at Wimbledon. That same year, he and Jonas Björkman defeated the Bryan brothers in men&#x27;s doubles at the 2006 French Open. In 2011, he and Daniel Nestor defeated Juan Sebastián Cabal and Eduardo Schwank at the 2011 French Open.

<text>Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad (or Abbad I; 984 – 25 January 1042) () was the eponymous founder of the Abbadid dynasty; he was the first independent Muslim ruler of Seville in Al-Andalus ruling from 1023 until his death in 1042.

Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad was a qadi (religious judge) when he was named governor of Seville by the caliph of Cordoba, Yahya ibn Ali ibn Hammud al-Mu&#x27;tali, in 1023. However, with the Caliphate of Cordoba losing its integrity, the Abbadids, a Sevillan family of Arabic origins, seized control.

As a result, later in 1023, Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad declared Seville independent from Córdoban rule, establishing the taifa of Seville.

<text>Ecstasy () is a subjective experience of total involvement of the subject with an object of their awareness. In classical Greek literature, it refers to removal of the mind or body &quot;from its normal place of function.&quot;

Total involvement with an object of interest is not an ordinary experience. Ecstasy is an example of an altered state of consciousness characterized by diminished awareness of other objects or the total lack of the awareness of surroundings and everything around the object. The word is also used to refer to any heightened state of consciousness or intensely pleasant experience. It is also used more specifically to denote states of awareness of non-ordinary mental spaces, which may be perceived as spiritual (the latter type of ecstasy often takes the form of religious ecstasy).

==Description==

From a psychological perspective, ecstasy is a loss of self-control and sometimes a temporary loss of consciousness, which is often associated with religious mysticism, sexual intercourse and the use of certain drugs. For the duration of the ecstasy the ecstatic is out of touch with ordinary life and is capable neither of communication with other people nor of undertaking normal actions. The experience can be brief in physical time, or it can go on for hours. Subjective perception of time, space or self may strongly change or disappear during ecstasy. For instance, if one is concentrating on a physical task, then any intellectual thoughts may cease. On the other hand, making a spirit journey in an ecstatic trance involves the cessation of voluntary bodily movement.

==Types==

Ecstasy can be deliberately induced using religious or creative activities, meditation, music, dancing, breathing exercises, physical exercise, sexual intercourse or consumption of psychotropic drugs. The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually also associated with that individual&#x27;s particular religious and cultural traditions. Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place due to occasional contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely beautiful or holy, or without any known reason. &quot;In some cases, a person might obtain an ecstatic experience &#x27;by mistake&#x27;. Maybe the person unintentionally triggers one of the probably many, physiological mechanisms through which such an experience can be reached. In such cases, it is not rare to find that the person later, by reading, looks for an interpretation and maybe finds it within a tradition.&quot;

People interpret the experience afterward according to their culture and beliefs (as a revelation from God, a trip to the world of spirits or a psychotic episode). &quot;When a person is using an ecstasy technique, he usually does so within a tradition. When he reaches an experience, a traditional interpretation of it already exists.&quot; The experience together with its subsequent interpretation may strongly and permanently change the value system and the worldview of the subject (e.g. to cause religious conversion).

In 1925, James Leuba wrote: &quot;Among most uncivilized populations, as among civilized peoples, certain ecstatic conditions are regarded as divine possession or as union with the divine. These states are induced by means of drugs, by physical excitement, or by psychical means. But, however produced and at whatever level of culture they may be found, they possess certain common features which suggest even to the superficial observer some profound connection. Always described as delightful beyond expression, these awesome ecstatic experiences end commonly in mental quiescence or even in total unconsciousness.&quot; He prepares his readers &quot;... to recognize a continuity of impulse, of purpose, of form and of result between the ecstatic intoxication of the savage and the absorption in God of the Christian mystic.&quot;

&quot;In everyday language, the word &#x27;ecstasy&#x27; denotes an intense, euphoric experience. For obvious reasons, it is rarely used in a scientific context; it is a concept that is extremely hard to define.&quot;

<doc id="630803" wikidata="Q7170503" url="?curid=630803" title="Personal equity plan">
<text>A personal equity plan (PEP) was a form of tax-privileged investment account in the United Kingdom, available between 1986 and 1999.

==History==
The plans were introduced by Nigel Lawson in the 1986 budget to encourage equity ownership among the wider population. PEPs were allowed to contain collective investments such as unit trusts. The &quot;single company PEP&quot;, which was allowed to contain shares of a single company, was introduced in 1992. PEPs were superseded by individual savings accounts in 1999, and remaining accounts were converted to individual savings accounts in 2008.

==Types and privileges==
Growth in a PEP was free from capital gains tax within the fund and on encashment. Income was free from income tax. When introduced in 1986, the fund was limited to £2,400 (annual allowance), but later increased to two types of PEP: the &quot;general PEP&quot; with an annual allowance of £6,000 and the &quot;single company PEP&quot; with an annual allowance of £3,000.

Investments in a general PEP were limited to qualifying collective investments. Qualifying investments had at least half of their assets invested in the UK, later extended to the European Union. The qualification rule for existing PEPs was removed in 2001. 

Single company PEPs could be invested in one company only. One way they could be used was to hold windfall shares received by members from mutual bodies when they became listed companies.

==Evolution==
Beginning 6 April 1999, the Advanced Corporation Tax relief on share dividends received on a PEP was halved, partially ending their tax-exempt status. From 6 April 2004 all relief on dividends was removed, although no additional tax at the higher rate was due where otherwise it might have been. Gains on capital, and all other forms of income such as cash interest and bond income, remained tax-free. Significant cash holdings for any length of time were discouraged by HM Revenue and Customs; the holdings in a PEP were supposed to be shares or corporate bonds.

== Replacement ==
Following the introduction of individual savings accounts on 6 April 1999, no new contributions could be made into PEPs. Existing funds retained their tax privileges and could be transferred to alternative managers. The distinction between general and single company PEPs was removed. On 6 April 2008, PEP accounts automatically became stocks and shares individual savings accounts.

<doc id="630804" wikidata="Q918109" url="?curid=630804" title="V-mail">
<text>V-mail, short for Victory Mail, was a hybrid mail process used by the United States during the Second World War as the primary and secure method to correspond with soldiers stationed abroad. To reduce the cost of transferring an original letter through the military postal system, a V-mail letter would be censored, copied to film, and printed back to paper upon arrival at its destination. The V-mail process is based on the earlier British Airgraph process.

==Operation and function==
V-mail correspondence was on small letter sheets, , that would go through mail censors before being photographed and transported as thumbnail-sized image in negative microfilm. Upon arrival to their destination, the negatives would be printed. The final print was 60% of the original document&#x27;s size, creating a sheet .

According to the National Postal Museum, &quot;V-mail ensured that thousands of tons of shipping space could be reserved for war materials. The 37 mail bags required to carry 150,000 one-page letters could be replaced by a single mail sack. The weight of that same amount of mail was reduced dramatically from 2,575 pounds to a mere 45.&quot; This saved considerable weight and bulk in a time in which both were hard to manage in a combat zone.

In addition to postal censorship, V-mail also deterred espionage communications by foiling the use of invisible ink, microdots, and microprinting, none of which would be reproduced in a photocopy.

== British &#x27;Airgraph&#x27;==
The airgraph was invented in the 1930s by the Eastman Kodak Company in conjunction with Imperial Airways (now British Airways) and Pan-American Airways as a means of reducing the weight and bulk of mail carried by air. The airgraph forms, upon which the letter was written, were photographed and then sent as negatives on rolls of microfilm. A General Post Office (GPO) poster of the time claimed that 1,600 letters on film weighed just , while 1,600 ordinary letters weighed . At their destination, the negatives were printed on photographic paper and delivered as airgraph letters through the normal Royal Engineers (Postal Section) – also known as the Army Postal Services (APS) – systems.

In 1940, the British Minister of Transport, Lieutenant Colonel John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara, put forward the idea that airgraphs be used to reduce both the bulk and weight of mail travelling between the Middle East Force (MEF) and the UK. The matter was referred to the APS and the GPO, who jointly investigated the possibility of using airgraphs. This eventually led to a service being instituted between England and Egypt in 1941 when 70,000 airgraphs were sent in the first batch and took three weeks to reach their destination.

Kodak had offices in Cairo that were capable of processing airgraph negatives, but it was not until the appropriate equipment arrived from America to their Cairo office that the APS was able to provide a return service to the UK.

In the theatres of war, the whole airgraph operation was coordinated by the APS. Completed airgraph forms were collected by the A/FPOs and forwarded to the Kodak processing plants, which were co-located with the Base APOs.

The use of the airgraph was not rationed and its postage was also set at three pence (3d). Although the airgraph proved to be immediately popular, its use was limited because of its size (approx; 11cm x 13cm; 4&quot; x 5&quot;) and lack of privacy, so when sufficient aircraft capacity became available, its use declined in favour of the air letter.

The airgraph service was later extended to: Canada (1941), East Africa (1941), Burma (1942), India (1942), South Africa (1942), Australia (1943), New Zealand (1943), Ceylon (1944), and Italy (1944).

== Historical antecedents ==

The U.S. military&#x27;s V-mail was based on British Airgraphs, which were based on Eastman Kodak&#x27;s patent obtained from New York City banker George McCarthy. Prior to that, a similar system was deployed during the Franco-Prussian War which used carrier pigeons to send primitive microfilm strips across German lines, developed from French optician René Dagron&#x27;s first patent granted for microfilm in 1859. Dagron&#x27;s microfilm patent was additionally based on British scientist John Benjamin Dancer, who created microfilm in 1839.

== In literature ==

The narrator of &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; takes to going through the trash-basket outside his neighbour Holly Golightly&#x27;s door:

:The same source made it evident that she received V-letters by the bale. They were always torn into strips like bookmarks. I used occasionally to pluck myself a bookmark in passing. &quot;Remember&quot; and &quot;miss you&quot; and &quot;rain&quot; and &quot;please write&quot; and &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;goddamn&quot; were the words that recurred most often on these slips; those, and &quot;lonesome&quot; and &quot;love&quot;.

<doc id="630814" wikidata="Q938328" url="?curid=630814" title="Space Age">
<text>The Space Age is a period encompassing the activities related to the space race, space exploration, space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events, beginning with the launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, and continuing to the present.

This period is characterized by changes in emphasis on particular areas of space exploration and applications. Initially, the United States and the Soviet Union invested unprecedented amounts of resources in breaking records and being first to meet milestones in crewed and uncrewed exploration. The United States established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the USSR established the Kosmicheskaya programma SSSR to meet these goals. This period of competition gave way to cooperation between those nations and emphasis on scientific research and commercial applications of space-based technology.

Eventually other nations became spacefaring. They formed organizations such as the European Space Agency (ESA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), and the China National Space Administration (CNSA). When the USSR dissolved the Russian Federation continued their program as Roscosmos.

In the early 2020s, some journalists have used the phrase &quot;New Space Age&quot; in reference to a resurgence of innovation and public interest in space exploration as well as commercial applications of low Earth orbit (LEO) and more distant destinations. New developments include the participation of billionaires in crewed space travel, including space tourism and interplanetary travel.

==Periodization==
The periodization of the Space Age can differ substantially, with some differentiating between a &quot;first&quot; Space Age and a &quot;second&quot; Space Age, which are separated at the turn of the 1980s/1990s.

==Periods==
===Foundational developments to suborbital spaceflights===

Some vehicles reached suborbital space much earlier than the launch of Sputnik. In June 1944, a German V-2 rocket became the first manmade object to enter space, albeit only briefly. In March 1926 American rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard launched the world&#x27;s first liquid fuel rocket but it did not reach outer space.

Since Germans undertook the sub-orbital V-2 rocket flight in secrecy, it was not initially public knowledge. Also, the German launches, as well as the subsequent sounding rocket tests performed in both the United States and the Soviet Union during the late 1940s and early 1950s, were not considered significant enough to define the start of the space age because they did not reach orbit. A rocket powerful enough to reach orbit could also be used as an intercontinental ballistic missile, that could deliver a warhead to any location on Earth. Some commentators claim this is why the orbital standard is commonly used to define when the space age began.

===1957 to 1970s/1980s: Establishment and &quot;Space Race&quot;===
The Space Race was the first era of the Space Age. It was a race between the United States and the Soviet Union which began with the Soviet Union&#x27;s October 4, 1957, launch of Earth&#x27;s first artificial satellite Sputnik 1 during the International Geophysical Year. Weighing and orbiting the Earth once every 98 minutes. The race resulted in rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and other areas. One of the underlying motivations for the space race was military. The two nations were also in a nuclear arms race following the Second World War. Both nations made use of German missile technology and scientists from their missile program. The advantages, in aviation and rocketry, required for delivery systems were seen as necessary for national security and political superiority.

The Cold War era competition between the United States and Soviet Union is one of the reasons the space age happened at that time. Since then the space age continues for the generation of scientific knowledge, the innovation and creation of markets, inspiration, and agreements between the space-faring nations. Other reasons for the continuation of the space age are defending Earth from hazardous objects like asteroids and comets.

Much of the technology developed for space applications has been spun off and found additional uses, such as memory foam. In 1958 the United States launched its first satellite, Explorer 1. The same year President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, commonly known as NASA.

Prior to the first attempted human spaceflight, various animals were flown into outer space to identify potential detrimental effects of high g-forces in takeoff and landing, microgravity, and radiation exposure at high altitudes.

The Space Race reached its peak with the Apollo program that captured the imagination of much of the world&#x27;s population. From 1961 to 1964, NASA&#x27;s budget was increased almost 500 percent, and the lunar landing program eventually involved some 34,000 NASA employees and 375,000 employees of industrial and university contractors. The Soviet Union proceeded tentatively with its own lunar landing program which it did not publicly acknowledge, partly due to internal debate over its necessity and the untimely death (in January 1966) of Sergey Korolev, chief engineer of the Soviet space program.

The landing of Apollo 11 was watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century. Since then, public attention has largely moved to other areas.

The last major leap of in the USSR-USA Space Race was the Skylab and Salyut programs, which established the first space stations for the U.S. and USSR in Earth orbit following termination of both countries&#x27; moon programs.

At the conclusion of the Apollo program, crewed flights from the United States were rare, then ended while the shuttle program was getting ready to kick into gear, and the space race had been over since the Apollo-Soyuz test project of 1975, started a period of U.S.–Soviet co-operation. The Soviet Union continued using the Soyuz spacecraft.

The shuttle program restored spaceflight to the U.S. following the Skylab program, but the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986 marked a significant decline in crewed Shuttle launches. Following the disaster, NASA grounded all Shuttles for safety concerns until 1988. During the 1990s funding for space-related programs fell sharply as the remaining structures of the now-dissolved Soviet Union disintegrated and NASA no longer had any direct competition, engaging rather in more substantial cooperation like the Shuttle-Mir program and its follow-up the International Space Station.

=== Diversification ===
While participation of private actors and other countries beside the Soviet Union and the United States in spaceflight had been the case from the very start of spaceflight development. A first commercial satellite had been launched by 1962, as well as in 1965 a third country achieving orbital spaceflight. The very beginning of the space age, the launch of Sputnik was in the context of international exchange, the International Geophysical Year 1957. Also soon into the space age the international community came together starting to negotiate dedicated international law governing outer space activity.

In the 1970s the Soviet Union started to invite other countries to fly their people into space through its Intercosmos program and the United States started to include women and people of colour in its astronaut program.

First exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union was formalized in the 1962 Dryden-Blagonravov agreement, calling for cooperation on the exchange of data from weather satellites, a study of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and joint tracking of the NASA Echo II balloon satellite. In 1963 President Kennedy could even interest premier Khrushchev in a joint crewed Moon landing, but after the assassination of Kennedy in November 1963 and Khrushchev&#x27;s removal from office in October 1964, the competition between the two nations&#x27; crewed space programs heated up, and talk of cooperation became less common, due to tense relations and military implications. Only later the United States and the Soviet Union slowly started to exchange more information and engage in joint programs, particularly in the light of the development of safety standards since 1970, producing the co-developed APAS-75 and later docking standards. Most notably this signaled the ending of the first era of the space age, the Space Race, through the Apollo-Soyuz mission which became the basis for the Shuttle-Mir program and eventually the International Space Station programme.

Such international cooperation, and international spaceflight organization was furthermore fueled by increasingly more countries achieving spaceflight capabilies and together with a by the 1980s established private spaceflight sector, both being embodied by the European Space Agency. This allowed the formation of an international and commercial post-Space Race spaceflight economy and period, with by the 1990s a public perception of space exploration and space-related technologies as being increasingly commonplace.

This increasingly cooperative diversification persisted until competition started to rise in this diversified conditions, from the 2010s and particularly by the early 2020s.

===2010s to present: &quot;New Space&quot; competition===
In the early 21st century, the Ansari X Prize competition was set up to help jump-start private spaceflight. The winner, Space Ship One in 2004, became the first spaceship not funded by a government agency.

Several countries now have space programs; from related technology ventures to full-fledged space programs with launch facilities. There are many scientific and commercial satellites in use today, with thousands of satellites in orbit, and several countries have plans to send humans into space. Some of the countries joining this new race are France, India, China, Israel and the United Kingdom, all of which have employed surveillance satellites. There are several other countries with less extensive space programs, including Brazil, Germany, Ukraine, and Spain.

As for the United States space program, NASA permanently grounded all U.S. Space Shuttles in 2011. NASA has since relied on Russia and SpaceX to take American astronauts to and from the International Space Station. NASA is currently constructing a deep-space crew capsule named the Orion. NASA&#x27;s goal with this new space capsule is to carry humans to Mars. The Orion spacecraft is due to be completed in the early 2020s. NASA is hoping that this mission will &quot;usher in a new era of space exploration.&quot;

Another major factor affecting the current Space Age is the privatization of space flight. A significant private spaceflight company is SpaceX which became the proprietor of one of world&#x27;s most capable operational launch vehicle when they launched their current largest rocket, the Falcon Heavy in 2018. Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of SpaceX, has put forward the goal of establishing a colony of one million people on Mars by 2050 and the company is developing its Starship launch vehicle to facilitate this. Since the Demo-2 mission for NASA in 2020 in which SpaceX launched astronauts for the first time to the International Space Station, the company has maintained an orbital human spaceflight capability. Blue Origin, a private company founded by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, is developing rockets for use in space tourism, commercial satellite launches, and eventual missions to the Moon and beyond. Richard Branson&#x27;s company Virgin Galactic is concentrating on launch vehicles for space tourism. A spinoff company, Virgin Orbit, air-launches small satellites with their LauncherOne rocket. Another small-satellite launcher, Rocket Lab, has developed the Electron rocket and the Photon satellite bus for sending spacecraft further into the Solar System, the company also plans to introduce the larger Neutron launch vehicle in 2025.

Elon Musk has the stated that the main reason he founded SpaceX is to make humanity a multiplanetary species, and cites reasons for doing it including: To ensure the long-term continuation of our species and protecting the &quot;light of consciousness&quot;. He also said, You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that&#x27;s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It&#x27;s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can&#x27;t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.

The Space Age marked a major comeback and return with the launch of NASA&#x27;s Space Launch system during the Artemis I mission on November 16, 2022; it marked the first time a human rated spacecraft had been to the Moon in nearly 50 years, as well as the return of United States capability to get astronauts to the Moon with the Space Launch System and Orion.
Additional goals for the 2020s include completion of the Lunar Gateway, mankind&#x27;s first space station around the Moon, and the first crewed moon landing since the Apollo era with Artemis III.

The U.S. Military has also joined the new space age with the creation of the new Space Force on December 20th 2019.

<text>Abu ʿAmr ʿAbbad II al-Muʿtadid (; died 28 February 1069), a member of the Abbadid dynasty, was the second independent emir of Seville (reigned 1042–1069) in Al-Andalus. His father, Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad, had established the Taifa of Seville, and Abbad became its emir when Abu al-Qasim died in 1042. He initially had amicable relations with his neighbour Ferdinand I, Count of Castile and King of León, and tolerated the Christian faith in his own lands. Among other acts of friendship, he authorized the transfer of Saint Isidore&#x27;s relics from Seville to the Basilica of San Isidoro in León.

Al-Muʿtadid expanded his territory by conquering numerous Islamic taifas (independent principalities), including those of Mértola (1044–45), Huelva (1051), Algeciras (1055), Ronda (1065) and Arcos (1069). In 1053, he invited a number of minor Berber princes from the south to his palace in Seville, suffocating them to death by treating them to an open steam bath, having first sealed up all of the openings in the bathhouse. He also fought against the Zirids of Granada and the Aftasids of Badajoz, but with no conclusive results. In 1063, when Ferdinand I appeared with an army on the outskirts of Seville, Al-Muʿtadid was forced to acknowledge his suzerainty and to pay him tribute.

Al-Muʿtadid died in 1069 and was succeeded by his son, al-Mu&#x27;tamid ibn Abbad.
