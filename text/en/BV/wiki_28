<text>David See-chai Lam, (; July 25, 1923November 22, 2010) was a Hong Kong-born Canadian banker, businessman, investor, philanthropist, and politician. From 1988 to 1995, Lam was the 25th Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, and he was the first Chinese Canadian to be appointed as a vice-regal in Canada. He was known for his charitable efforts, donating millions of dollars and leveraging millions more to support educational institutions and activities in Hong Kong, Canada, and the United States.

== Early life ==
David See-chai Lam was born in Hong Kong on July 25, 1923; he was the second oldest of nine children of Lam Chi Fung, a Hong Kong coal importer and distributor, and Chan Chik-Ting Lam. When Lam turned 18, his plans to attend university were sidelined by World War II. During the war, he worked in the administration of the family’s coal business, and his life was often at risk. Among the close calls, Lam was bombed at a dock, chased by pirates, and opted not to board a ship that was later torpedoed. Understanding the danger, Chi Fung decided it was time for Lam to undertake his university studies.

In 1947, Lam earned a degree in economics from Lingnan University in Hong Kong. He developed fluency in five languages, and earned an MBA degree from Temple University in the United States. He returned to Hong Kong in 1949 and began a successful career in his family&#x27;s banking business at Ka Wah Bank. While dancing at a ball, Lam met his future wife, Dorothy. They dated for two years, and married in the fall of 1954. Together they had three daughters: Deborah, Daphne, and Doreen. After working as a banker for 18 years, Lam and his family immigrated to Vancouver in 1967.

== Career ==
Lam became a prominent real estate entrepreneur in Vancouver, and was a leading proponent of many groundbreaking real estate development ventures. The company he founded is now known as Pacific Canadian Investments (PCI). He is also noted for being a leading philanthropist. He founded the Floribunda Philanthropic Society, and the David &amp; Dorothy Lam Foundation. He donated substantial funds to cultural projects in his adopted province and country. He served as Chairman of Hong Kong Baptist College, trustee of the Chancellor&#x27;s Circle at the University of British Columbia, which later awarded him an honorary degree, and was a benefactor to the David C. Lam Institute for East-West Studies at Hong Kong Baptist University. In 1986, he helped found the Canadian International Dragon Boat Festival.

=== Lieutenant governor ===
In 1988 Governor General Jeanne Sauvé, on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, appointed him lieutenant governor. Lam represented the Crown during the term of three Premiers: William Vander Zalm, Rita Johnston, and Michael Harcourt.

He formally ended the practice of lieutenant governors wearing the Windsor uniform. This practice was reinstated by Lieutenant Governor Steven Point.

Lam was Canada&#x27;s second non-white lieutenant governor (the first being Lincoln Alexander of Ontario) and was the first Asian Canadian as well as the first Chinese Canadian lieutenant governor.

== Honours ==
*In 1988, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St. John (KStJ) and Vice-Prior of the Order from 1988 to 1995.
*In 1988, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 1995. 
*In 1994, he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) by the Queen in 1994.
*In 1995, he was awarded the Order of British Columbia.
*In 1995, David Lam Park in Vancouver, BC was named after him.

==Death==
Lam died on November 22, 2010, from prostate cancer at the age of 87. He was predeceased by his wife of 43 years, Dorothy, who died in 1997, and survived by three children and seven grandchildren.

<doc id="615972" wikidata="Q4781194" url="?curid=615972" title="Apple Jacks">
<text>Apple Jacks is an American brand of breakfast cereal that is produced by both successors to the original Kellogg&#x27;s—WK Kellogg Co in the United States, Canadian, and Caribbean markets and Kellanova in the rest of the world. It was introduced to the U.S. as &quot;Apple O&#x27;s&quot; in 1965 after being invented by college intern William Thilly. In 1971 the name &quot;Apple Jacks&quot; was put into action by advertisers. The product is described by Kellogg&#x27;s as a &quot;crunchy, sweetened multi-grain cereal with apple and cinnamon.&quot; Apple Jacks is one of the top four cereal brands marketed within stores and is most heavily marketed on Kellogg&#x27;s internet platform.

Originally, the Apple Jacks were only orange and O-shaped, until 1998 when the green O-shapes were added to the cereals. In a marketing promotion in December 2003, the green pieces changed their shape to X&#x27;s for a few months.
More recently, Apple Jacks has introduced New Apple Jacks &quot;Crashers&quot; – a unique cereal piece that replicates a mid-2007 advertising campaign when mascots Apple and CinnaMon were accidentally fused together. The latest (limited) edition, in 2010, are Apple Clones, with red pieces shaped like apples.

In 2001, Apple Jacks was brought to Canada in a Limited Edition box.

Apple Jacks were later released in Australia and can be found at Woolworths Supermarkets and Aldi, alongside Kellogg&#x27;s Australia&#x27;s Apple Jacks LCMs, a puffed rice snack bar with marshmallow flavour and Apple Jacks flavoured sprinkles.

==Advertising==
The first Apple Jacks mascot in the 1960s was &quot;Apple Jack&quot;, a figure made from cutting a mouth onto an apple and applying a hat and pieces of cereal for eyes.

Television advertisements featuring Apple Jack had the tagline “A bowl a day keeps the bullies away!”, but was later altered to “A bowl a day gives you energy to play!”.

In the late 1960s the box depicted an &quot;Apple Car&quot; with pieces of cereal for wheels.

Around 1971, the official mascots became &quot;The Apple Jacks Kids&quot;, a simplistically drawn animated boy and girl. The commercials featured the children singing and tumbling around all day. Their reign lasted for 21 years, making them the most well-known Apple Jacks mascots and most universally associated with the cereal in the public&#x27;s memory. During this time, the Apple Jacks jingle became an integral part of the ad campaign: &quot;A is for apple, J is for Jacks, Cinnamon-toasty Apple Jacks!&quot; This campaign was retired in 1992.

Starting in 1992, there was an advertising campaign that featured children expressing their enjoyment of Apple Jacks, regardless of its lack of apple flavor. The slogan for this campaign became &quot;We eat what we like&quot;. The shift toward marketing cereals directly at children signaled the growing recognition of children&#x27;s influence on family purchases. The commercials took place in normal kid hang-outs, such as: at school, the garage, ballet class, and the kitchen, in the hall/hallway/door jamb, among others. In each commercial, a group of children are having Apple Jacks, when suddenly, some other people, such as adults or jealous kids, bash the group claiming it does not taste like apples and asks why they love it so much. The group then explains their love of the cereal usually by just saying, &quot;We just do&quot;, and at the end of the commercial, would pose for a group Polaroid.

As of 2004, the marketing mascots were a carefree Jamaican cinnamon stick named CinnaMon and an accident-prone apple named Bad Apple. Labeled as &quot;Apple Jacks Adventures&quot; in print advertising, the commercials focused on CinnaMon upstaging Bad Apple by reaching a bowl of Apple Jacks before he can, in spite of the apple&#x27;s attempts to stop him. Bad Apple&#x27;s antagonistic nature was later dropped due to complaints from non-profit health food organizations such as Center for Science in the Public Interest over the campaign discouraging children from eating fruit by antagonizing the Apple character, leading to Apple and CinnaMon being portrayed as highly competitive friends, both getting into the bowl. The campaign was slated to be retired in 2007, and replaced by a retread of the 1990s campaign focused on children, but fan response to Apple and CinnaMon helped them remain as the mascots. In 2007, Apple and CinnaMon were fused together with CinnaMon sticking through the center of Apple with both of their legs at the bottom of their body. They remained this way for a few of the commercials until they became unstuck by a special machine.

==Nutrition==
According to the label on the box, in 2010, each 28 gram serving had 100 calories, three grams of dietary fiber, and 12 grams of sugar. 

==Cinnamon Jacks==
In 2013, Kellogg&#x27;s Apple Jacks introduced a new multi-grain cereal called &quot;Cinnamon Jacks&quot;, with the cinnamon stick, CinnaMon, as its sole mascot. The cereal is flavored with brown sugar and cinnamon.

<doc id="615976" wikidata="Q754849" url="?curid=615976" title="Residual value">
<text>Residual value also known as salvage value describes the future value of a good in terms of absolute value in monetary terms after depreciation, and it is sometimes abbreviated into a percentage of the initial price when the item was new. It is one of the constituents of a leasing calculation or operation and is a key concept in accounting. It represents the amount of value that the owner of an asset can expect to obtain when the asset of its lease or when it reaches the end of its useful life.

Example: A car is sold at a list price of $20,000 today. After a usage of 36 months and 50,000 miles (ca. 80,467 km) its value is contractually defined as $10,000 or 50%. The credited amount, on which the interest is applied, thus is $20,000 present value minus the present value of $10,000 future value.

== Treatment ==
Residual values are contractually dealt with either in terms of closed or open contracts.

In accounting, residual value is another name for salvage value, the remaining value of an asset after it has been fully depreciated, or after deteriorating beyond further use.

The residual value derives its calculation from a base price, calculated after depreciation.

Residual values are calculated using a number of factors, generally a vehicles market value for the term and mileage required is the start point for the calculation, followed by seasonality, monthly adjustment, lifecycle, and disposal performance. The leasing company setting the residual values (RVs) will use their own historical information to insert the adjustment factors within the calculation to set the end value being the residual value.

In accounting, the residual value could be defined as an estimated amount that an entity can obtain when disposing of an asset after its useful life has ended. When doing this, the estimated costs of disposing of the asset should be deducted.

The formula to calculate the residual value can be seen with the next example as follows:

A company owns a machine which was bought for €20,000. This machine has a useful life of five years, which has just ended. The company knows that if it sells the machine now, it will be able to recover 10% of the price of acquisition.

Therefore, the residual value would be:

<text>Tylöskog is a forested area in southeast Sweden, intersected by many faults, running from east to west between the agricultural plains of the counties of Närke and Östergötland. Together with Tiveden to its west and Kolmården to its east, it constituted the border between the Swedes in Svealand and the Geats in Götaland. Beginning in the 11th century, iron was smelted there using water power.

<doc id="615982" wikidata="Q1779560" url="?curid=615982" title="Kolmården">
<text>Kolmården () is a long and wide densely forested rocky ridge that separates the Swedish provinces of Södermanland and Östergötland, two of the country&#x27;s main agricultural areas, from each other, and in historic times, along with Tylöskog and Tiveden, formed the border between the land of the Swedes and the land of the Geats.

==History==
In early medieval times it was seen as a major obstacle in land travel between the regions, and so the Baltic Sea was largely used instead. Together with the extensive forests of Tiveden and Tylöskog to its west, Kolmården formed a major impediment for travel between the Swedes in Svealand to the north and the Geats in Götaland, which caused peaceful and warlike interaction to be conducted by water.

In the Icelandic text &quot;Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum&quot;, Kolmården between Svealand and Östergötland is described as the border between Sweden and Östergötland (..). It also appears as Mirkwood in some editions of Sögubrot, in the legend of Helgi Hundingsbane and probably also in &quot;Völundarkviða&quot;.

==Geography==

The forest is divided between Norrköping Municipality and Nyköping Municipality on either side of the regional border. The Östergötland side has the majority of the population, centred in the village of Krokek. Settlements Strömsfors and Kvarsebo are also included on that side of the border. The Södermanland side has the small settlements of Kila, Stavsjö and Ålberga in Nyköping&#x27;s Kila district named after river Kilaån that flows through Kolmården towards the Baltic Sea.

Today the forest is traversed by the Norrköping–Nyköping railway, the Norrköping–Katrineholm railway, and the E4 highway, all connecting southern Sweden with Stockholm and the Mälaren region. Along the former there is also a Kolmården railway station, at Krokek next to Bråviken.

==Climate==
Kolmården has a climate that is a hybrid between maritime and continental with some differences between lower, coastal parts, and the higher forested hills. The Kolmården weather station is located at above sea level and therefore has some orographic lift, resulting in increased rainfall for the region. Its position in a hill lowers daytime highs compared to the municipal seat of Norrköping, while lows remain similar to the lower elevation. The elevated nature Kolmården has an effect on rainfall east of it, splitting many fronts in two, creating a micro version of a rain shadow. As a result, the climates right on the coastline of Oxelösund and Nyköping become drier than the waterfront next to the Kolmården hills.

==Kolmården Wildlife Park==

The Kolmården Wildlife Park, opened in 1965, overlooks Bråviken bay. This zoo includes the only dolphinarium in Sweden.

<text>Kodiak Island (, ) is a large island on the south coast of the U.S. state of Alaska, separated from the Alaska mainland by the Shelikof Strait. The largest island in the Kodiak Archipelago, Kodiak Island is the second largest island in the United States and the 80th largest island in the world, with an area of , slightly larger than Cyprus. It is long and in width ranges from . Kodiak Island is the namesake for Kodiak Seamount, which lies off the coast at the Aleutian Trench. The largest community on the island is the city of Kodiak, Alaska.

Kodiak Island is mountainous and heavily forested in the north and east, but fairly treeless in the south. The island has many deep, ice-free bays that provide sheltered anchorages for boats. The southwestern two-thirds of the island, like much of the Kodiak Archipelago, is part of Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.

Kodiak Island is part of the Kodiak Island Borough and Kodiak Archipelago of Alaska. The town of Kodiak is one of seven communities on Kodiak Island and is the island&#x27;s main city. All commercial transportation between the island and the outside world goes through this city either via ferryboat or airline. Other settlements include the villages of Akhiok, Old Harbor, Karluk, Larsen Bay, Port Lions, and an unorganized community near Cape Chiniak. The village of Ouzinkie on nearby Spruce Island is also part of the island community.

Kodiak is also home to the largest U.S. Coast Guard base, which includes Coast Guard Base Kodiak, Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak, Communications Station Kodiak, and Aids to Navigation Station Kodiak. The island is also home to the Pacific Spaceport Complex.

The Kodiak bear and the king crab are native to the island. The fishing industry is the most important economic activity on the island; fisheries include Pacific salmon, Pacific halibut, and crab. The Karluk River is famous for its salmon run. Logging, ranching, numerous canneries, and some copper mining are also prevalent.

An antenna farm at the summit of Pillar Mountain above the city of Kodiak provides primary communications to and from the island.

==History==

Kodiak is the ancestral land of the Sugpiaq, an Alutiiq nation of Native Americans. The original inhabitants subsisted by hunting marine mammals, fishing, and gathering. Kodiak Island was explored in 1763 by Russian fur trader Stepan Glotov.

The first outsiders to settle on the island were Russian explorers under Grigory Shelikhov, a fur trader, who founded a Russian settlement on Kodiak Island at Three Saints Bay in 1784; the present-day village of Old Harbor developed near there. In 1792, the settlement was moved to the site of present-day Kodiak and became the center of Russian fur trading with the Alaska Natives.

In 1793, Grigory Shelikhov, with the help of the governor-general of Irkutsk, was given twenty craftsmen and ten families of farmers with the obligation of paying government taxes for them, for promoting successful development of Russia-America settlements and the establishment of shipyards and factories. The settlers provided to Shelikhov were not serfs in the full sense of the word. It was not possible to sell, mortgage, or give away the settlers; they were owned by the company for as long as the Shelikhov-Golikov Company existed.
In 1784, Shelikhov, along with 130 Russian fur traders, massacred (see Awa&#x27;uq Massacre) several hundred &quot;Qik’rtarmiut Sugpiat&quot; (&quot;Sugpiaq people of Qik’rtaq/Kodiak&quot;) tribe of Alutiiq men, women and children at Refuge Rock, a tiny stack island off the eastern coast of Sitkalidak Island. In Alutiiq, this sacred place is now known as &quot;Awa&#x27;uq&quot;, &quot;to become numb&quot;.

The Alutiiq were conscripted by the Russian occupants for the purpose of hunting, gathering, and processing food and furs. Native labor was commandeered through hostage taking, physical threat, and punishment. The Alutiiq men were forced to obtain quotas of otter pelts and bird skins which were then stitched into waterproof parkas by the Alutiiq women. The waterproof garments, made by the Alutiiq women, were given to the Alutiiq men as payment for the furs brought to the Russian fur traders.

The Orthodox mission in Russian America was authorized by Catherine II in 1793, and then was established on Kodiak Island in 1794 by a group of monks from the Valaam Monastery in Saint Petersburg.

The Russian fur traders radically expanded sea otter hunting operations and forced the Alutiiq men to hunt for longer periods of time at increasingly distant areas as the local population of fur-bearing animals was extinguished. The Alutiiq suffered starvation and physical separation of families because of the able-bodied men hunting and trapping furs rather than providing food for the women, young, old, and sick as they had done traditionally.

In 1837–1839, a smallpox epidemic swept through all the Russian America territory and destroyed an estimated one-third of the Native population. The remaining Alutiiq on Kodiak Island were then consolidated into seven settlements where they were more readily offered medical, educational, and religious services by the Russian-American Company. The smallpox epidemic was eventually stopped with vaccination of the natives.

Following the 1867 Alaska purchase by the United States, the island became part of the United States. Gradually Americans settled there, also engaging in hunting and fishing.

===1912 Novarupta eruption===
Novarupta is a volcano northwest of Kodiak Island that erupted from June 6 to June 8, 1912: the largest eruption in the 20th century. Life on Kodiak Island was immobilized during the 60-hour eruption. Darkness and suffocating conditions caused by the falling ash and sulfur dioxide gas rendered villagers helpless with sore eyes and respiratory problems. Water became undrinkable. Radio communications were disrupted and visibility was nil. Roofs in the village collapsed under the weight of more than a foot of ash. Buildings were destroyed as avalanches of ash rushed down from nearby hillsides.

On June 9, Kodiak villagers saw the first clear, ash-free skies in three days, but their environment had changed dramatically. Wildlife on Kodiak Island was devastated by ash and acid rain from the eruption. Bears and other large animals were blinded by thick ash, and many starved to death because large numbers of plants and small animals were smothered in the eruption. Birds blinded and coated by volcanic ash fell to the ground. Even the region&#x27;s prolific mosquitoes were exterminated. Aquatic organisms in the region perished in the ash-clogged waters. Salmon in all stages of life were destroyed by the eruption and its aftereffects. From 1915 to 1919, southwestern Alaska&#x27;s salmon-fishing industry was devastated.

===1964 earthquake===
The island was also hit by the 1964 Good Friday earthquake and tsunami, which destroyed much of the waterfront, the business district, and several villages.

==Climate==
The weather of Kodiak is temperate by Alaskan standards. December to March is the cold season while June to August is the summer season. It is &quot;Dfc&quot; bordering on &quot;Cfb&quot;, &quot;Dfb&quot; and &quot;Cfc&quot; in the Koppen classification.
==Education==
The University of Alaska Anchorage has a campus which opened in 1968, located about northwest of the City of Kodiak.

==Parks and protected areas==
Nearly two-thirds of the island is located within the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge and has no road access. Refuge headquarters are located on the Chiniak Highway, right at the access road for the Buskin River State Recreation Site, which has camping, picnic areas, beaches, and fishing for salmon and trout in the Buskin River.

The Pasagshak River State Recreation Site is a park with a small campground and access to some of the island&#x27;s best salmon and trout fishing.
The island is also home to the Fort Abercrombie State Historical Park.

<doc id="615989" wikidata="Q820204" url="?curid=615989" title="Commissar Order">
<text>The Commissar Order () was an order issued by the German High Command (OKW) on 6 June 1941 before Operation Barbarossa. Its official name was Guidelines for the Treatment of Political Commissars (&quot;Richtlinien für die Behandlung politischer Kommissare&quot;). It instructed the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; that any Soviet political commissar identified among captured troops be summarily executed as a purported enforcer of the so-called Judeo-Bolshevism ideology in military forces. It is one of a series of criminal orders issued by the Nazi leadership.

According to the order, all those prisoners who could be identified as &quot;thoroughly bolshevised or as active representatives of the Bolshevist ideology&quot; should also be killed.

==History==
Planning for Operation Barbarossa began in June 1940. In December 1940, Adolf Hitler began vague allusions to the operation to senior generals on how the war was to be conducted, giving him the opportunity to gauge their reaction to such matters as collaboration with the SS in the &quot;rendering harmless&quot; of Bolsheviks, which eventually culminated in on 18 December 1940. The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; was already politicised to some extent, having participated in the extra-legal killings of Ernst Röhm and his associates in 1934, communists in the Sudetenland in 1938, and Czech and German political exiles in France in 1940. On 3 March 1941, Hitler explained to his closest military advisers how the war of annihilation was to be waged. On that same day, instructions incorporating Hitler&#x27;s demands went to Section L of the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW) (under Deputy Chief Walter Warlimont); these provided the basis for the &quot;Guidelines in Special Areas to Instructions No. 21 (Case Barbarossa)&quot; discussing, among other matters, the interaction of the army and SS in the theatre of operations, deriving from the &quot;need to neutralise at once leading bolsheviks and commissars.&quot;

Discussions proceeded on 17 March during a situation conference, where Chief of the OKH General Staff Franz Halder, Quartermaster-General Eduard Wagner, and Chief of Operational Department of the OKH Adolf Heusinger were present. Hitler declared: &quot;The intelligentsia established by Stalin must be exterminated. The most brutal violence is to be used in the Great Russian Empire&quot; (quoted from Halder&#x27;s War Diary entry of 17 March ).

On 30 March, Hitler addressed over 200 senior officers in the Reich Chancellery. Among those present was Halder, who recorded the key points of the speech. He argued that the war against the Soviet Union &quot;cannot be conducted in a knightly fashion&quot; because it was a war of &quot;ideologies and racial differences.&quot; He further declared that the Commissars had to be &quot;liquidated&quot; without mercy because they were the &quot;bearers of ideologies directly opposed to National Socialism.&quot; Hitler stipulated the &quot;annihilation of the Bolshevik commissars and the Communist intelligentsia&quot; (thus laying the foundation for the Commissar Order), dismissed the idea of courts-martial for felonies committed by German troops, and emphasised the different nature of the war in the East from the war in the West.

Hitler was well aware that this order was illegal, but personally absolved in advance any soldiers who violated international law in enforcing this order. He said that the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 did not apply since the Soviets had not signed them. The Soviet Union, as a distinct entity from the Russian Empire, did not, in fact, sign the Geneva Convention of 1929. However, Germany did, and was bound by Article 82, stating &quot;In case, in time of war, one of the belligerents is not a party to the Convention, its provisions shall nevertheless remain in force as between the belligerents who are parties thereto.&quot;

The Commissar Order read as follows:
==Response==
The first draft of the Commissar Order was issued by General Eugen Müller on 6 May 1941 and called for the shooting of all commissars in order to avoid letting any captured commissar reach a POW camp in Germany. German historian Hans-Adolf Jacobsen wrote:

There was never any doubt in the minds of German Army commanders that the order deliberately flouted international law; that is borne out by the unusually small number of written copies of the &quot;Kommissarbefehl&quot; which were distributed.

The paragraph in which Müller called for army commanders to prevent &quot;excesses&quot; was removed on the request of the OKW. German Army Commander-in-Chief Walther von Brauchitsch amended the order on 24 May 1941 by attaching Müller&#x27;s paragraph and calling on the army to maintain discipline in the enforcement of the order. The final draft of the order was issued by the OKW on 6 June 1941 and was restricted only to the most senior commanders, who were instructed to inform their subordinates verbally.

Nazi propaganda presented Barbarossa as an ideological-racial war between German National Socialism and &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism,&quot; dehumanising the Soviet enemy as a force of Slavic &quot;Untermensch&quot; (sub-humans) and &quot;Asiatic&quot; savages engaging in &quot;barbaric Asiatic fighting methods&quot; commanded by evil Jewish commissars to whom German troops were to grant no mercy. The vast majority of &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; officers and soldiers tended to regard the war in Nazi terms, seeing their Soviet opponents as sub-human.

The enforcement of the Commissar Order led to thousands of executions. German historian Jürgen Förster wrote in 1989 that it was simply not true that the Commissar Order was not enforced, as most German Army commanders claimed in their memoirs and some German historians like Ernst Nolte were still claiming. The majority of German units carried out the Commissar Order. Erich von Manstein passed on the Commissar Order to his subordinates, who executed all the captured commissars, something that he was convicted of by a British court in 1949. After the war, Manstein lied about disobeying the Commissar Order, saying he had been opposed to the order, and never enforced it. On 23 September 1941, after several &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; commanders had asked for the order to be softened as a way of encouraging the Red Army to surrender, Hitler declined &quot;any modification of the existing orders regarding the treatment of political commissars.&quot;

When the Commissar Order became known among the Red Army, it provoked stronger resistance to German forces. This unwanted effect was cited in German appeals to Hitler (e.g. by Claus von Stauffenberg), who finally cancelled the Commissar Order after one year, on 6 May 1942. The order was used as evidence at the Nuremberg trials and as part of the broader issue of whether the German generals were obligated to follow orders from Hitler even when they knew those orders were illegal.

<text>The Freedom Association (TFA) is a pressure group in the United Kingdom that describes itself as &quot;a non-partisan, classically liberal campaign group&quot;, which has links to the Conservative Party and UK Independence Party (UKIP). TFA was founded in 1975 as the National Association for Freedom (NAFF) and gained public prominence through its anti-trade union campaigns. Its popularity grew after campaigning against perceived abuses to individual freedom including big business, big government, organised labour and Irish political violence. By the end of the 1970s the organisation had around 20,000 members.

In the 1980s, TFA campaigned against sporting sanctions imposed on apartheid-era South Africa – earning a judicial rebuke after taking unsuccessful legal action to overturn the International Cricket Council ban on touring teams, which it saw as an imposition on cricketers&#x27; freedom. TFA has also campaigned against the UK&#x27;s membership of the European Union and against perceived partiality at the BBC, having in the past exerted pressure to secure an &quot;impartiality clause&quot; in the Broadcasting Act 1990. The current Chief Executive of The Freedom Association is Andrew Allison.

==Origin==
The Freedom Association was founded in 1975 as the National Association for Freedom (NAFF) by the Viscount De L&#x27;Isle, Norris McWhirter, Ross McWhirter and John Gouriet. Ross McWhirter had drawn up a fifteen-point &quot;Charter of Rights and Liberties&quot; before being murdered by the Provisional IRA in November 1975. NAFF was renamed The Freedom Association in late 1978. Andrew Gamble reported shortly after that the renaming was undertaken in order to avoid confusion with the National Front.

==Political stance==

The Freedom Association describes itself as &quot;a non-partisan, classically liberal campaign group&quot;. In their study of the use of litigation by pressure groups, Carol Harlow and Richard Rawlings call TFA &quot;an avowedly conservative group&quot;. Marina Hyde, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, has called the organisation a &quot;charmless libertarian pressure group&quot;.

===Principles===
The organisation describes itself as having ten core principles, namely individual freedom, personal and family responsibility, the rule of law, limited government, free market economy, national parliamentary democracy, strong national defences, a free press and other media, freedom of religion and belief, and freedom of speech, expression and assembly. Writing in 1989, Michael White differentiated between TFA&#x27;s brand of libertarianism and that of civil liberties campaigners, arguing that: &quot;The unavoidable fact is that TFA represents that ancient tradition of English concepts of freedom, easily traceable to &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, which see liberty in terms of freedoms from restraints and obligations, not civil rights and duties enunciated by Jefferson in the rebellious American colonies, by Tom Paine and the revolutionaries of 1789&quot;.

===Party links===
The group has no formal party political affiliations but historically most members of TFA have also been associated with the Conservative Party. In May 1978, this led to former Conservative minister William van Straubenzee accusing TFA of &quot;extremist infiltration&quot; of his party. TFA has been described as the &quot;conservative wing of the Conservative Party&quot;. Since 2007, TFA has been running fringe events at the Conservative Party conference with speakers such as Daniel Hannan and John Redwood and groups including the Taxpayers&#x27; Alliance.

==Leadership==
The Freedom Association&#x27;s council includes Honorary Chairman: David Campbell Bannerman. Conservative members of parliament Sir Christopher Chope, Philip Hollobone, and Andrew Rosindell, former Conservative MEP Lord Hannan, former UKIP MEP Roger Helmer, former Conservative member of the Scottish Parliament Brian Monteith, Baroness Cox, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, a former leader of UKIP and Walter Sweeney, a former Conservative MP. The Chief Executive is Andrew Allison.

==Campaigns==
===Trade unions===
In the 1970s, the founders regarded the power of the UK trade union movement as excessive and out of control. Soon after its formation the National Association for Freedom as TFA was then known became involved in a number of industrial disputes providing support to both employers and non-unionised workers to counter to the power of the Trades Unions. The best known of these actions was &quot;Operation Pony Express&quot; during the Grunwick dispute. Harold Walker, the Labour Secretary of State for Employment between 1976 and 1979, was strongly critical of NAFF&#x27;s activities, claiming the group was an &quot;ultra right-wing political organisation&quot; which &quot;sought to interfere in industrial disputes, with harmful consequences&quot;. Following the election of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, the Association &quot;suffered a slow decline in membership&quot;. In January 1989, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Michael White reported that TFA &quot;no longer has the power or glory it enjoyed when it was Thatcherism&#x27;s extra-parliamentary advance guard against a fading Labour government and its union allies.&quot;

===Apartheid-era South Africa===
In the 1980s, TFA campaigned in support of the right of England cricketers to tour in apartheid-era South Africa. In 1989, when the International Cricket Conference (ICC) passed a resolution formalising sanctions against players, coaches and administrators who worked in South Africa, Norris McWhirter described the decision as &quot;a crushing blow against cricketers&#x27; freedom to trade&quot;. TFA had obtained a criminal summons against the ICC, alleging blackmail but this was subsequently quashed in the High Court, where the judge Lord Taylor ruled that TFA&#x27;s application was &quot;an abuse of the process of the court&quot; and was &quot;launched solely as a device to disrupt or embarrass the International Cricket Conference&quot;. The organisation was later revealed to have received funding from the South African government.

In 1988, the association threatened to seek a legal injunction against the BBC to prevent the broadcaster from broadcasting the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute from Wembley Stadium. A group of Conservative MPs and TFA objected to the possibility that the broadcast would include a message from Mandela or &quot;other anti-apartheid propaganda.&quot; The threat was dropped, &quot;in the hope that the BBC [would] not broadcast any attempt to use the concert for promoting the African National Congress or similar anti-apartheid bodies.&quot;

===National identity cards===
In 2010 the group campaigned against the proposed introduction of national identity cards, which they deemed to be a threat to civil liberties. Previously, in the 1980s, some prominent supporters of TFA, such as Sir Rhodes Boyson had strongly supported the introduction of ID cards.

===Better Off Out===
In April 2006 TFA launched Better Off Out, a campaign for the UK to leave the EU. This has attracted the support of one Labour, one UKIP and twelve Tory MPs, plus a number of MEPs, Peers, academics, journalists and influential business figures. It was officially launched in Parliament by Philip Davies, despite criticism from Conservative party leader David Cameron. Signatories to the campaign include Daniel Hannan, Douglas Carswell, Philip Hollobone, Jeffrey Donaldson, David Nuttall, Austin Mitchell, David Campbell-Bannerman, Nigel Farage, Gerard Batten, Roger Helmer and Patrick Minford.

During the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Better Off Out played a role in the campaign.

===The BBC and the licence fee===
The Freedom Association also has a campaign called Axe the TV tax, with the objective of abolishing the BBC licence fee. It opposes the BBC on what it perceives as bias, particularly with regard to the European Union prior to the referendum on the UK&#x27;s future membership. It has called for the BBC to be funded instead by subscription, arguing that the pace of technological change will render the licence fee redundant. John Whittingdale, a former Council member of the Freedom Association, was appointed Secretary of State for Culture in 2015. Following a debate in Parliament on the issue in March 2017, the Association expressed a hope that it could work with MPs to make sure at the end of the BBC&#x27;s present Charter period, the licence fee would become &quot;a relic of the past&quot;.

===Libel reform===
As part of their commitment to freedom of speech, the Freedom Association wants to see reform of libel law in the UK. They believe that the use of superinjunctions and defamation law effectively acts as a limit on free speech.

===&quot;Magna Carta&quot; in the 21st century===
The Freedom Association considers &quot;Magna Carta&quot; to be one of the most fundamental documents in English Law. The Association produced a book, &quot;Magna Carta in the 21st Century: Modern Britain and The Erosion of Freedom&quot; which highlighted how the traditions of &quot;Magna Carta&quot; were being usurped by legal traditions from elsewhere in the world. The book is designed for school children, to educate them about the core concepts of English legal traditions. In doing so, the Association hoped it could enhance the understanding of both &quot;Magna Carta&quot; and the conditions necessary for a legal system to be free from corruption. In 2015, on the 800th anniversary of &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, The Freedom Association held a number of events with The Hampden Trust and the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies across England to debate the relevance of the Great Charter in the 21st Century.

===Vaping===
In 2016, the Freedom Association launched the Freedom to Vape campaign. It aims to lobby the Government to remove the regulations imposed on the vaping industry by the European Union&#x27;s Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) 2016. The campaign, receiving support and funding from the vaping industry, also wants to raise awareness of the difference between vaping and smoking combustible tobacco and to set up a ‘freedom-to-vape’ scheme for businesses who welcome vapers.

===Freedom Association Societies===
Beginning in 2009, the Association initiated a programme to create localised &quot;Freedom Association Societies&quot; at universities throughout the United Kingdom. The first such group was established at the University of York followed by another founded at the University of Exeter by John Gill, the grandson of Christopher Gill, the Association&#x27;s President. Other Freedom Association Societies have since been established at Bath Spa University, the University of Birmingham, Brighton University, Cambridge University, Cardiff University, Portsmouth University and both the University of Southampton and Southampton Solent University. In the 1980s, TFA ran a Campaign for Student Freedom, against the National Union of Students.

==Political events==
===The Freedom Zone===
The Freedom Zone is a fringe event run by the Freedom Association, focusing on topical political issue through discussions with politicians and commentators, which has been run at party conferences since 2008. Most recently, they attended the 2014 Conservative Party Conference, where they held discussions on &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, Policing, UKIP and the EU. Speakers at the Freedom Zone have included Eric Pickles, Daniel Hannan, Hugh Orde, Dominic Raab, Fraser Nelson, Paul Staines, Peter Lilley, John Whittingdale, Ruth Lea and Nigel Farage.

The Freedom Zone is always held outside the &quot;secure zone&quot; of the main Conservative party conference, because the Freedom Association states that it has been banned from the main venue since 2006, when it was told that there was no space within the zone for its stand. It therefore promote debates of more controversial issues, which normally do not feature in the main debate such as during the 2013 Freedom Zone, when they held a debate on the issue of Tory defection to UKIP – &quot;Why I left v Why I&#x27;m staying&quot;, having already invited Nigel Farage to speak the day before. The Freedom Zone has also been to the UKIP and Liberal Democrat Conference in 2011 and the Labour Party Conference in 2012.

===Pub quizzes===
The Freedom Association also hold pub quizzes, usually with Jacob Rees-Mogg as quizmaster, in Westminster that have, according to Iain Dale, gained a &quot;cult status&quot;.

===Freedom in the City===
Held regularly in the City of London, Freedom in the City events provide an opportunity for those working in the City to hear from political speakers.

===Magna Carta Day Pimm&#x27;s &amp; Politics Boat Trip===
Restarted in 2013 after a 19-year hiatus, the Magna Carta Day Pimm&#x27;s &amp; Politics Boat Trip is a day-long river cruise down the Thames from Windsor to Runnymede. Speakers on previous cruises have included Daniel Hannan MEP, Robert Halfon MP and Christopher Gill.

===Margaret Thatcher Birthday Weekend===
Established following the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, annually the TFA organises a weekend in Grantham, the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, to celebrate her legacy on the date of her birth. Taking place at the Best Western Angel &amp; Royal Hotel, attendees have the opportunity to hear from speakers who worked with Margaret Thatcher and those who now promote the values which Margaret Thatcher held dear.

===Freedom Festival===
Beginning in 2014, the Freedom Festival is a weekend conference dedicated to freedom and liberty. Held in Bournemouth each March, delegates are able to play an active part in discussions and debates about the big political, economic and moral issues. Past speakers have included Daniel Hannan, Mark Littlewood, Matthew Elliott and Tim Congdon.
Other organisations that have participated at the Freedom Festival have included the Adam Smith Institute, Big Brother Watch, Conservative Way Forward, the Centre for Policy Studies, the Institute of Economic Affairs, the TaxPayers’ Alliance and Global Britain. In 2015, they held their inaugural Freedom Zone North Conference in Harrogate.

==Publications==
The Freedom Association produces many publications on a range of issues through the charity, the Hampden Trust. Recent publications include &quot;In Defence of the City&quot;, a collection of essays by financial commentators and professionals about the role of financial services in the UK and their contribution to the UK economy with an introduction by Mark Littlewood, Director General of the Institute of Economic Affairs, and &quot;Commonwealth, Common-trade, Common-growth&quot;, a book advocating a move towards increased trade with Commonwealth countries amidst high growth in developing countries.

During 2015, the Freedom Association produced a number of publications celebrating the 800th anniversary of &quot;Magna Carta&quot; and published, with the help of the Hampden Trust, a new &quot;Magna Carta for the 21st Century&quot;. In addition, the Freedom Association publishes a number of reports on the EU through its Better Off Out campaign, such as &quot;The EU&#x27;s Effect on the UK&#x27;s Place in the World&quot;, which was submitted to the government for their balance of competences review.

===&quot;Freedom Today&quot;===
The Freedom Association also publishes a quarterly newsletter entitled &quot;Freedom Today&quot;, which features a number of articles from TFA supporters.

==British Tea Party movement==
The Freedom Association has expressed an interest in establishing a British equivalent of the American Tea Party movement, though its then director, Simon Richards, stated in October 2010 that he was worried that such a project could be hijacked by extremist groups such as the English Defence League.

<doc id="615993" wikidata="Q1760318" url="?curid=615993" title="Puma (car manufacturer)">
<text>Puma Automóveis Ltda. is a Brazilian manufacturer of sports cars. It was established in 1963 as &quot;Sociedade de Automóveis Lumimari&quot;, then became &quot;Puma Veículos e Motores&quot; the following year, and &quot;Puma Indústria de Veículos SA&quot; in 1974.

The brand ceded production rights for a limited time to other companies, including Brazilian companies &quot;Araucária Veículos Ltda&quot; first and &quot;Alfa Metais Veículos Ltda&quot; later, and also to a company in South Africa in the years 1973–1974, 1989–1991, 2007, and finally 2014 when the production rights for Puma models expired.

In 2013, the company was revived by a former industrial director of Puma Indústria de Veículos SA under the name &quot;Puma Automóveis Ltda&quot;, headquartered in the countryside of São Paulo. New projects included the Puma P-052 prototype, built specifically for motorsports and the Puma GT Lumimari, named in honor of the company&#x27;s original name.

==History==

Puma originated with Italian-born Brazilian immigrant and designer Rino Malzoni, who conceived of a vehicle with a sporty looking fiberglass body mounted on a production car chassis, with engine and suspension modifications to boost performance.

This idea moved Malzoni to create a prototype racing car, developed on his farm in Matão in the interior of São Paulo. It had the support of Veículos e Máquinas Agrícolas S.A. (Vemag), the Brazilian DKW representative, who supplied an engine and rolling chassis with the goal of unseating Willys at the Autodromo de Interlagos. The prototype, which had a front-mounted , three-cylinder DKW engine and weighed , posted five wins at Interlagos in 1964, and won the main races the following year.

With the enormous success of the model and several victories in various competitions in the same year the first vehicle was launched, Sociedade de Automóveis Lumimari Ltda was founded by several car enthusiasts including Luiz Roberto Alves da Costa (LU) Milton Masteguin (MI) ), Mário César de Camargo Filho (MA) and Rino Malzoni. Each founder contributed the first two letters of their first names to the company&#x27;s name. The first model produced was named the GT Malzoni in honor of the creator and principal person involved in the brand. In 1966 the brand was renamed to Puma Veículos e Motores Ltda at the suggestion of the head of the competition department at Vemag, Jorge Lettry.

Also in 1966, Puma participated in the Motor Show and presented its newest model, the Puma GT, known by many as the Puma DKW, which was for the most part an improvement on the GT Malzoni, as it used the same bodywork and corrected some problems of the first and added some new features, in total about 125 units were produced, until Vemag was bought by Volkswagen (VW) in 1967. In the same year, Puma was renamed Puma Indústria de Veículos SA, becoming a publicly traded company.

===Change to Volkswagen===
When VW took over DKW-Vemag, Malzoni lost his supply of chassis and engines. He spent nine months on his farm working to create a new vehicle using a Volkswagen Karmann Ghia chassis, and a rear-mounted 1.5 L Volkswagen air-cooled engine and transaxle. This became one of Puma&#x27;s most successful models, being produced between 1967 and 1970 and helping the company&#x27;s growth and consolidating the brand.

In 1969, Puma made a limited edition of its sports cars to be drawn in Quatro Rodas magazine, one of the most important magazines in the automotive world in the country, the model in question was the Puma GT4R, in which only 3 were produced for the draw, in copper, blue and green; later on, another model was made, this one for Malzoni.
In 1970, Puma launched its most successful car to date, the Puma GTE, (E for “Export”), a sports car to be distributed around the world, including sales to Europe, Asia, Africa and the American continent. The Puma GTE was an updated version of the Puma GT, having its design reformulated, updated and complying with the traffic laws of each country where it was ordered. In 1971 the Puma Spider was launched, a modified, convertible version of the Puma GTE. Both vehicles made extensive use of VW components. The models were updated and re-released in 1976.

===Diversification===
In 1971, Puma began to manufacture truck cabs for Chevrolet as a sideline. In 1978, Puma decided to launch its own truck model, called the 4T. Years later the Puma 6T model was launched, and in 1981 the Puma 2T model and buses were also made with chassis of its trucks. In 1974 the Puma GTB (for &quot;Gran Turismo Brasil&quot;) was launched. Based on the chassis of the Chevrolet Opala, it had been in development since 1971. It was one of the most expensive cars in Brazil at the time, but was a great success between the year of its launch and 1987. In 1978, the Puma GTB S2 was launched, an updated GTB for the 1980s with a more modern, more powerful and larger design, that used the chassis of the Volkswagen Brasília instead of the Karmann Ghia&#x27;s.

The founder and creator of the brand, Rino Malzoni, died in 1979, at the age of 62.
In 1980 two models emerged, the Puma GTI and the Puma GTC, both being a re-styling of the Puma Spider, with the GTC being the convertible version of the Puma GTI. These vehicles also used the Brasília chassis, and became part of the new era Puma models that improved upon the old models.

In the early 1980s the company experienced financial and structural difficulties, caused in part by fires in its factories. The company believed that a way out this crisis was to revive one of its classics. Puma began developing a new model based on the GTI, called the P-016, which would have its own chassis, a modern suspension, and a water-cooled engine. Due to high costs, the P-016 was cancelled. In parallel with the P-016, the P-018 project was also developed. Still using the chassis and mechanics from Volkswagen, clothed in a new body, this project provided the inspiration for the later, front-engined GTB S2 model. The P-018 was released in 1981, but due to its problems, Puma ended up ceding its rights for a limited time in November 1985 to Araucária Veículos, a company from Paraná, which continued production of the Puma models.

A few years later, in 1988, Alfa Metais Veículos Ltda bought Araucária Veículos and acquired the rights of Puma and also continued with the new models, but those with some design modifications and a Chevrolet Opala engine, these models did not please the buyers. In 1990, a major partner of the company, Nívio de Paula, died in an accident, causing even more problems for the company. Puma sports vehicles continued to be produced until 1993, until it was discontinued and Alfa Metais Veículos remained active. with the manufacture of buses and trucks.

In 1991 the 914 truck was launched, which was based on the 4Q, but with further improvements and also remaining a large cargo truck; in 1994 the brand launched the 9000 Turbo Power truck, which is a much more powerful truck with a better design and resolution of the brand until that moment; in 1996 Puma launched its latest project, the 7900 CB, a cabin version little different from the 9000 Turbo Power and which was soon discontinued. Alfa Metais Veículos stopped the production of Puma trucks and vehicles in 1999, with this, the rights of the brand returned to Puma Indústria de Veículos SA.

In 2007, Puma based in Durban, South Africa, began manufacturing the Puma GT model, with Volkswagen components, in limited quantities. Puma had already ceded its production rights in the country years before, in 1972 and 1989.

=== Resurgence ===
Puma returned to activity in 2013 initially with the partnership of two enthusiastic entrepreneurs: Fernando Mesquita and Reginaldo Galafazzi, who created the Mesgaferre Automobile Society. In November 2014, when the Puma brand turned 50 years old. Afterwards the name was definitively changed to Puma Automóveis Ltda (new official name of the company) announced the creation of a prototype model of the brand for P-052 racing. The car is inspired by the former GT model, Lotus Elise and Porsche boxers.

The new model would be manufactured with lines inspired by the classic Puma “shark” GTE and with a fiberglass body, as well as a central-rear engine and tubular structure. The main idea was to produce a batch of 25 to 30 cars to create its own automobile category, sponsored by Jan Balder, director of competitions at Puma and former driver, partner of Emerson Fittipaldi in the legendary Thousand Miles of 1966, driving a GT Malzoni. The prototype was presented at the end of 2016 in the last stage of the São Paulo Automotive Championship, at the Autodromo de Interlagos, in São Paulo. The track category has not yet been completed, but Puma has created the approved version for the streets. The new Puma is named GT Lumimari in honor of the company&#x27;s original 1963 name.

Additionally, Aoki has appeared on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot; (American, Germany, Russia, Japan, Korea) and &quot;Numéro&quot; (Tokyo). In 2006, she posed for Singaporean photographer Leslie Kee for the charity photo-book &quot;Super Stars&quot;, which was dedicated to the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami disaster.

In September 2007, she designed a capsule collection for Levi&#x27;s Asian market called Levi&#x27;s +D. Aoki described the collaboration by saying: &quot;It&#x27;s called Levi&#x27;s + D, the D is for Devon. We&#x27;re doing everything from denim to swimwear – you name it! I get inspired by vintage pieces you can&#x27;t really get anymore.&quot; In 2017, she returned to the runway for Moschino&#x27;s fashion show and appeared in advertising campaigns for &quot;Sephora x Moschino&quot; and Hugo Boss.

In September 2019, she appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;″s &quot;Bazaar Icons 2019&quot; issue, photographed by Mario Sorrenti.

===Acting===
As an actress she has appeared in the films &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;, &quot;D.E.B.S.&quot;, &quot;Sin City&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;War&quot;, &quot;Mutant Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead&quot;. She was cast as Tatsu Yamashiro in &quot;Arrow&quot; season 3, but was replaced by Rila Fukushima due to a scheduling conflict. She appeared briefly in the documentary films &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot; and &quot;Jeremy Scott: The People&#x27;s Designer&quot;, the former being a documentary about her brother Steve.

==Impact==
She is considered as an icon in the fashion industry by models.com. In 2017, Dominic Cadogan of &quot;Dazed&quot; called Aoki a &quot;cult model&quot; and &quot;one of the most recognizable alternative faces of the 90s&quot;. Cadogan continued by saying, &quot;by the time she was 16, she was one of the most in-demand girls of the moment, with some of the industry&#x27;s top photographers (including Juergen Teller, Ellen von Unwerth and Nick Knight) all transforming her in their images.&quot; In April 2019, &quot;Marie Claire&quot; listed her as one of the 15 supermodels of the 2000s who changed the face of fashion. &quot;L&#x27;Officiel USA&quot; called her &quot;an eternal fashion It-girl&quot;, while &quot;I-D&quot; magazine wrote that Aoki is &quot;one of those few faces that defined the turn of the millennium,&quot; and listed seven of Aoki&#x27;s most iconic outfits.

In February 2019, &quot;Wonderland&quot; magazine reported that singer Rihanna channeled Aoki&#x27;s look from the action film &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; for her Fenty Beauty campaign. In the film, Aoki&#x27;s character Suki drives her custom pink Honda S2000 wearing a white top and pink jeans.

== Personal life ==
Devon Aoki is married to James Bailey, and they have one son and three daughters. She retired from full-time film acting in 2009 to focus on motherhood. Her daughter Alessandra appeared in Guess Kids&#x27; spring 2018 advertising campaign. Model and singer-songwriter Yumi Nu is Aoki&#x27;s niece.

She modeled during the third annual charity fashion show presented by General Motors on February 24, 2004. Aoki and her half-brother Steve co-chaired the 2018 Red Cross Gala in San Francisco in March 2018.

<text>Mount Roraima (; ) is the highest of the Pacaraima chain of tepuis (table-top mountain) or plateaux in South America. It is located at the junction of Brazil, Guyana and Venezuela. A characteristic large flat-topped mountain surrounded by cliffs high. The highest point of Mount Roraima is located on the southern edge of the cliff at an elevation of in Venezuela, and another protrusion at an elevation of at the junction of the three countries in the north of the plateau is the highest point in Guyana. The name Mount Roraima came from the native Pemon people. &quot;Roroi&quot; in the Pemon language means &quot;blue-green&quot;, and &quot;ma&quot; means &quot;great&quot;.

Leaching caused by intense rainfall has shaped the peculiar topography of the summit, and the geographical isolation of Mount Roraima has made it home to much endemic flora and fauna. Western exploration of Mount Roraima did not begin until the 19th century, when it was first climbed by a British expedition in 1884. Yet despite subsequent expeditions, its flora and geology remain largely unknown. The privileged setting and relatively easy access and climbing conditions on the south side of the cliffs make Mount Roraima a popular destination for hikers.

==Geography==
Mount Roraima is located in the northern part of South America, the Pacarema Mountains in the eastern part of the Guyana Plateau, Brazil in the east accounting for 5% of its area, Guyana in the north accounting for 10%, and Venezuela in the south and west accounting for 85%. Access to Mount Roraima from the Venezuelan side is close to the road and relatively easy; however, for both Brazil and Guyana the area is completely isolated and can only be reached by a few days of forest hikes or small local airstrip.

Mount Roraima is a flat-topped mountain, typical of the Guyana Shield, with an elevation of about in the southeast and only about in the northwest. The south, southeast, east, northeast and northwest faces are all formed by straight cliffs up to about high. At the southern end of the mountain, part of the cliff has collapsed, forming a natural boulder. The base of the cliff is surrounded by steep slopes to the south and east, and the north and west sides form river valleys leading to the summit.

The top of Mount Roraima has a length of more than , a maximum width of , an area of about , an elevation of more than , and an average elevation of . The plateau is a pseudo-karst surface etched by heavy rainfall. The highest point is above sea level, located at the southern end of the plateau and the highest point in the state of Bolívar, north of the summit is another high point with an elevation of , which is the highest point in Guyana. In the northern part of the plateau is the landmark of the border between Brazil, Venezuela and Guyana, with an elevation of .

Due to its height and proximity to the equator, Mount Roraima has a constant average annual temperature between and annual rainfall of more than , with in parts of the rainy season from April to November. The climatic conditions at the top of the mountain differ significantly from its base, the high cloudiness in the region is associated with the prevailing northeasterly and southeasterly winds, and the relative humidity of the air remains between 75% and 85%.

==Geology==
Mount Roraima is composed of Proterozoic age sandstone formed about 1.7 to 2 billion years ago, and hence amongst the oldest rocks on Earth. It contains a large amount of quartz deposits, 98% are silica particles, forming white or pink crystals several centimeters long. These rocks sit on a granite and gneiss base and were originally covered by layers of Mesozoic clay, conglomerate, and diorite, but have been exposed by erosion and by orogeny over the past 180 million years, eroded by precipitation to form strange shapes. The soil of the sandstone matrix is highly acidic, poor in nutrients, and very fine. Intense rainfall prevents the fixation of nutrients and particles, thereby preventing the formation of hilltop vegetation and soil.

The numerous caves and rifts in the interior of the plateau make Mount Roraima exhibit a pseudo-karst structure, and these caves form a network over long, with a total height difference of . It contains the largest quartz cave in the world, discovered by the Oxford University Cave Club and the Venezuelan Speleological Society. These caves are formed by the infiltration of surface water, so the water level inside them depends largely on the precipitation on the surface of the plateau: prolonged drought can dry up waterways, and dry caves can also become underground rivers. The water that poured into it rushed into the crevices of the rock and flowed out in the form of waterfalls on the mountainside, creating many streams at the foot of the mountain.

==Ecology==
Due to the late exploration of this part of South America and the discovery of new species every year, the flora and fauna here are largely unknown. The currently identified species are strongly endemic, especially the fauna, which also puts them at a high risk of extinction. The bottom of the cliff at the foot of the mountain is an evergreen rainforest composed of trees high, and some can reach . Vegetation is dominated by Arecaceae and Astragalus. The soils on the cliffs are more sandy, the climate is cooler, and the vegetation consists of bromeliads very similar to the Andes. The vegetation on the plateau is still largely unknown and consists mainly of bare rocks, forests of trees and epiphytes, and wet and dry savannas in the form of swamps. It is marked by numerous endemic species, especially carnivorous plants that capture insects, living in sandstone and leaching soils which lack the nitrates necessary for their development. There are fewer species in the vicinity of streams and ravines, and the trees are tall and have hard leaves that can adapt to harsh environmental conditions. The exposed rocks are occupied by lichens, algae and cyanobacteria.

Endemic flora includes plants like the Orectanthe sceptrum, Sauvagesia imthurnii, Celiantha imthurniana, Roraima marsh pitchers (Heliamphora nutans), Gran Sabana sundew (Drosera felix), Roraima bladderworts (Utricularia quelchii), Roraima &quot;azaleas&quot; (Bejaria imthurnii) and many more.

The fauna at the foot of the mountain are composed of a variety of mammals, and this huge diversity is particularly prominent in the Amazon rainforest, such as sloths, anteaters, tapirs, armadillos, capybaras, opossums, agouti, weasels, raccoons, deer, cougars, and primates such as howler monkeys and capuchins. There are hundreds of species of birds, the most common of which include falcons, parrots, and owls. Some hummingbirds are endemic to the region. Due to low mobility relative to other species, reptiles and amphibians show large differences between individuals found at the bottom and top of Mount Roraima. While species inhabiting forests at the foot of the plateau are common, such as green iguanas, pit vipers, coral snakes and pythons, those found at the top are even rarer. Cave fauna consists of many species of bats, grasshoppers, spiders and centipedes, but this fragile subterranean ecosystem is being disturbed by surface hikers, organic matter produced by tourists, and explorers over the years. Pollutants such as fuel are washed into the ground by rainwater, which leads to the proliferation of microorganisms and causes ecological imbalance.

Endemic species include rodents such as the Roraima climbing mouse (Rhipidomys macconnelli roraimae) or the rarer Roraima mouse (Podoxymys roraimae), as well as many birds such as the Greater flowerpiercer (Diglossa major) or the two subspecies of sparrow, the Zonotrichia capensis roraimae and the Zonotrichia capensis macconelli. One of the most well known endemic species is the Roraima toad (Oreophrynella quelchii).

==Exploration==
European discovery was in 1595, during a Spanish and British race to colonize this part of South America. The English poet, army officer and explorer Walter Raleigh described it as an immeasurable &quot;crystal mountain&quot; gushing countless waterfalls. The first expedition to Mount Roraima took place in 1838, when German scientist and explorer Robert Hermann Schomburgk observed it during a Royal Geographical Society-funded expedition to explore British Guiana (1835–1839). In 1840, the British government commissioned him to establish the boundaries between British Guiana and Venezuela. When he returned to the area in 1844 to study the local flora, he reported that the peak seemed inaccessible due to its towering cliffs. In 1864, German naturalist and botanist Carl Ferdinand Appun and British geologist Charles Barrington Brown arrived at the southeastern tip of Mount Roraima for observation and proposed to go up the mountain by hot air balloon.

Although its vertical cliffs make access very difficult, Mount Roraima was the first large mesa to be climbed in the Guyana Plateau. Henry Whiteley, who studied the birds of the area, observed that the summit could be reached from the south with the help of ropes and ladders. Everard im Thurn and Harry Perkins led an expedition sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society that culminated on December 18, 1884, when the team met local people known as the Pemón who could have climbed to the top of Mount Roraima prior to their expedition. The explorers still believed the top of the cliff to be previously unknown to humans. Soon, many expeditions made up of botanists, zoologists and geologists made multiple expeditions to Mount Roraima to study the mostly unknown flora and fauna and special geological conditions of the area.

==Climbing==
Mount Roraima and Mount Aoyan are the only flat-topped mountains in the Canaima National Park that can be climbed by hikers, with a monthly quota of 200 people. Its ascent takes three to five days in total, the summit route is on a natural slope on the southwestern cliffs of Mount Roraima, it does not require any special equipment or training, so it is chosen by almost all hikers, the only difficulty is that some streams and small waterfalls may become difficult to pass under heavy rain. However, the length of the trail requires climbers to spend one night at the base camp at the foot of the cliff at an elevation of about 2,000 meters, and another night at the summit, taking several days to explore the plateau and two days to descend. The best time to climb Mount Roraima is in the dry season, however, when the sun is very strong and the temperature is high, it can make the road to the mountain difficult.

<text>A Standesamt (, plural &quot;Standesämter&quot;, ) is a German civil registration office, which is responsible for carrying out the tasks stipulated in the Civil Status Act (&quot;Personenstandsgesetz&quot;), in particular for maintaining civil status registers, preparing civil status documents and other tasks.

Soon after the German Empire was created in 1871 from the previous collection of German states (kingdoms, duchies, etc.), a universal system of register offices was established, taking effect on 1 January 1876. The system had previously been introduced in Prussia on 1 October 1874, and had been in use since the beginning of the 19th century in areas where the French Civil Code applied. Usually, the office was located in the local city or town hall.

Today, those register offices (Standesämter) are still part of the administration of every German municipality (in small communities, they are often incorporated with other offices of the administration). Since 1876, Germans in Germany can only enter into a legal marriage in a Standesamt. Therefore, every German marriage takes place before the local registrar (called &quot;Standesbeamter&quot;). A religious ceremony has no legal effect and could till the year 2009 only be organised afterwards. Apart from that, every child born in Germany has to be registered at a register office (normally by its parents) and every death has to be registered, also. Same sex &quot;life partnerships&quot; were also registered at Standesamts from 2001, until the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Germany in 2017.

People who are born in Germany can get a copy of their birth certificates in the Standesamt office.

The term &quot;Standesamt&quot; is also used for Austrian register offices, whereas in Switzerland the German word for register office is &quot;Zivilstandsamt&quot;.</text><links>

<text>The European Foundation is a Eurosceptic think tank based in the United Kingdom, founded in 1992. It is chaired by Bill Cash, a British Conservative MP. The organisation produces the European Journal.

The College Street Group was formed in October 1992 in order to oppose the Maastricht Treaty. The Group, consisting of politicians, academics, businessmen, lawyers, and economists, provided briefs in the campaign to win the arguments both in Parliament and in the country. The European Foundation was created out of Great College Street by Bill Cash after the Maastricht debates. It conducted a campaign in the UK to leave the European Union.

It was reported in 1996 that the European Foundation was being funded by Sir James Goldsmith the then leader of the British Referendum Party. Because there was an approaching election at which Conservative and Referendum candidates would be contesting the same seats, Cash was forced to sever the link. The shortfall in funding was plugged by Margaret Thatcher, who later became the European Foundation&#x27;s Patron, a position she held until her death.

<doc id="616011" wikidata="Q5245223" url="?curid=616011" title="Dead Horse (band)">
<text>Dead Horse was a thrash metal band from Houston, Texas, which was active in the 1980s and 1990s and again during the 2010s. They have also been described as death metal and crossover thrash. Dead Horse also incorporated elements of country music and Texas culture that can be heard on songs such as &quot;Hank&quot; from &quot;Horsecore&quot; and &quot;Chiggers&quot; from &quot;Feed Me&quot;.

== History ==
=== Initial career (1987–1997) ===
The band&#x27;s first release titled &quot;&quot; was released independently in 1989 while a nationally distributed LP &quot;Peaceful Death and Pretty Flowers&quot; was released in 1991 through the independent record label Big Chief and distributed by Metal Blade under its parent Warner Bros. Records. Dead Horse released the self-financed EP &quot;Feed Me&quot; in 1993 which was intended as a demo for Interscope Records but failed to garner any major label interest. It was about that time that lead vocalist/guitarist Michael Haaga left the group to pursue other interests and Dead Horse replaced Haaga with Austin musician Scott Sevall (ex-Force Fed) and rerecorded a new demo &quot;BOIL&quot; receiving positive review in Metal Maniacs in later 1995. Later in 1996, Dead Horse recorded the EP &quot;BOIL(ing)&quot; with Tim Gerron and released it on Beermoment Music through Sound Virus Records.

=== Post-breakup (1998–2010) ===
Haaga went on to form &quot;The Demonseeds&quot; with drummer Joseph Fazzio and bassist Craig Cazaubon and managed one album entitled &quot;Knee Deep in Hell&#x27;s Grasp&quot; released in 1999. The band was also nominated by the Houston Press in 2000 for &quot;Best Metal/Hard Rock&quot; but didn&#x27;t manage to win their category as far as the &quot;Readers Choice&quot; was concerned but did manage to win the &quot;Critics Choice&quot; for that category.

Haaga is also credited on the first release from Superjoint Ritual titled &quot;Use Once and Destroy&quot; as the band&#x27;s bassist and backing vocalist but his credit is buried 14 lines down below the other listed band members, just below the disc&#x27;s &quot;Photography&quot; credit. He also went on to release a solo LP with the backing of several musicians from the Houston and Austin area entitled &quot;The Plus and Minus Show&quot;. It was released in late 2004 and it managed to garner four Houston Press Music Awards in 2005 or really five awards if you include the one awarded to Best Guitar winner Kelly Doyle that year, who in addition to playing in &quot;The Plus and Minus Show&quot;, also played in Houston Bands &quot;Three Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Clouseaux&quot;. Haaga&#x27;s first solo effort won Album of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, Song of the Year and Local Artist of the Year. The band broke up shortly thereafter.

Ronnie Guyote also played drums in Houston based metal band &quot;nOthing&quot; which began towards the end of his tenure with Dead Horse but ended abruptly towards the end of 2005 when their vocalist/guitar player&#x27;s drug addiction began to compromise the band&#x27;s professionalism and integrity. It was about this time that Ronnie and nOthing bassist Mike Lucas joined up with Mike BBQ to reform Houston Industrial band Death Kultur BBQ but have only played a handful of shows since 2005 but most recently in 2014.

In 1999, Relapse Records re-released &quot;Horsecore&quot; and &quot;Peaceful Death and Pretty Flowers&quot;; all of the tracks from &quot;Death Rides a Dead Horse&quot; were bonus tracks for &quot;Horsecore&quot; while &quot;Peaceful Death and Pretty Flowers&quot; was accompanied with a track from &quot;Feed Me&quot; and tracks from their 1990 demo. Additionally, there were hidden tracks on both of the reissued CD&#x27;s. On &quot;Horsecore&quot;, the hidden track was the slowed down version of &quot;French Fry&quot; immediately followed by the real-time version of &quot;French Fry&quot;. &quot;French Fry&quot; appeared on the original CD issue as track eight while apparently not on the original vinyl. On &quot;Peaceful Death and Pretty Flowers&quot;, the unnamed bonus hidden track was a collection of slowed down, spoken voices from the song Peaceful Death.

Greg, Scott, and Ronnie have since gone on to form the band Pasadena Napalm Division with D.R.I. vocalist Kurt Brecht along with nOthing bassist Mike Lucas. Shortly after, Lucas left the band and the bassist role was filled by Bubba (ex Verbal Abuse and FANG member). He is the bassist on both the PND ep. and the self titled Pasadena Napalm Division full length.

In 2014, original Dead Horse bassist Allen Price joined PND after the release their 2013 full-length LP entitled Pasadena Napalm Division on Minus Head Records.

=== Reunion (2011–2019) ===
In 2011 the Boil(ing) era members of dead horse reunited with the addition of Mike Argo on vocals and re-released their last album &quot;BOIL(ing).&quot; The band subsequently played reunion shows in Houston at the Warehouse Live, in Austin at FunFunFunFest, and also in Fort Worth at The Rail Club on December 2 and 3, 2011. In November 2012, Dead Horse released the DVD &quot;Making a Dead Horse LIVE&quot;, which contains live footage of the new line-up and played coinciding DVD release shows in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and Houston.

On July 4, 2014, Dead Horse released a new CD titled &quot;Loaded Gun&quot; featuring four new songs and 10 live tracks from the &quot;Making a Dead Horse LIVE!&quot; DVD with the band&#x27;s current lineup. Dead Horse has been actively writing and playing shows in the southern US in between stints playing as Pasadena Napalm Division with D.R.I. vocalist Kurt Brecht.

Dead Horse released their first studio album in 26 years, &quot;The Beast That Comes&quot;, on September 15, 2017.

In 2019, Dead Horse once again called it quits.

<text>The European Young Conservatives (EYC) is a grouping of youth wings of conservative and centre-right political parties in Europe.

As of 2014, the group has a membership of 25 political youth organisations from 22 countries and territories, in addition to four associated members. The EYC is independent and not affiliated with any European political party, but maintains a non-exclusive relationship with the European Conservatives and Reformists Party.

The EYC is a full member of the International Young Democrat Union.

==History==
The EYC was founded in August 1993 by the youth wings of the British Conservative Party, Danish Conservative People&#x27;s Party, and Icelandic Independence Party, under the leadership of Andrew Rosindell, then-chairman of the UK&#x27;s Young Conservatives.

It emerged from a split in the centre-right Democrat Youth Community of Europe (DEMYC), which separated into two factions: the larger part, following a broadly Christian democratic philosophy; and the smaller part, led by Rosindell, following a broadly conservative philosophy. Two crucial points of disagreement were the scope of economic liberalisation and the desirability of a federal Europe.

From 1993 to 1997, the group was led by Rosindell. The group gave training to newly established democratic political parties in Russia, Belarus, and Azerbaijan. It was refounded much later by Oliver Cooper.

The EYC generally holds three conference events per year, with the largest being the autumn Freedom Summit.

===Freedom Summit===
* Cambridge, United Kingdom - 2014
* Cambridge, United Kingdom - 2015
* Porto, Portugal - 2016
* Warsaw, Poland - 2017

===Summer Camp===
* Stockholm, Sweden - 2014
* Tbilisi, Georgia 2016
* Prague, Czech Republic - 2017
* Leptokarya, Greece - 2018
* Leptokarya, Greece - 2019

===Annual Congress===
* Warsaw, Poland - 2012
* Prague, Czech Republic - 2013
* Istanbul, Turkey - 2014
* Prague, Czech Republic - 2015
* Brussels, Belgium - 2016
* London, United Kingdom - 2017
* Warsaw, Poland - 2018
* Amsterdam, Netherlands - 2019

Since 2016, an internal conflict between civic and ethnic nationalists has emerged within the EYC. The ethnic nationalists were opposed to the membership of Turkish and Israeli parties and claimed the EYC has &quot;replaced anti-immigration politics with free market capitalism&quot;. Resulting from the dispute, the Finns Party Youth announced its withdrawal on May 18, 2017, with its leader Samuli Voutila saying: &quot;We cannot be members in the same organization as the new Turkish sultan’s youth wing, when it acts against European values.&quot; On June 12, the Estonian movement Blue Awakening sent a letter to the EYC demanding the expulsion of the Turkish AK Party Youth within seven days. The letter was later published on Richard B. Spencer&#x27;s website Altright.com.

==Membership==
The EYC has twenty-five member organisations:

<doc id="616019" wikidata="Q5283219" url="?curid=616019" title="Distributivity (order theory)">
<text>In the mathematical area of order theory, there are various notions of the common concept of distributivity, applied to the formation of suprema and infima. Most of these apply to partially ordered sets that are at least lattices, but the concept can in fact reasonably be generalized to semilattices as well.

==Distributive lattices==
Probably the most common type of distributivity is the one defined for lattices, where the formation of binary suprema and infima provide the total operations of join (formula_1) and meet (formula_2). Distributivity of these two operations is then expressed by requiring that the identity

: formula_3

hold for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;. This distributivity law defines the class of distributive lattices. Note that this requirement can be rephrased by saying that binary meets preserve binary joins. The above statement is known to be equivalent to its order dual

: formula_4

such that one of these properties suffices to define distributivity for lattices. Typical examples of distributive lattice are totally ordered sets, Boolean algebras, and Heyting algebras. Every finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to a lattice of sets, ordered by inclusion (Birkhoff&#x27;s representation theorem).

==Distributivity for semilattices==

A semilattice is partially ordered set with only one of the two lattice operations, either a meet- or a join-semilattice. Given that there is only one binary operation, distributivity obviously cannot be defined in the standard way. Nevertheless, because of the interaction of the single operation with the given order, the following definition of distributivity remains possible. A meet-semilattice is distributive, if for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;x&quot;:

: If &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; then there exist &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;b&#x27; &quot; and &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&#x27; &quot;.

Distributive join-semilattices are defined dually: a join-semilattice is distributive, if for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;x&quot;:

: If &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot; then there exist &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&#x27; &quot;.

In either case, a&#x27; and b&#x27; need not be unique.
These definitions are justified by the fact that given any lattice &quot;L&quot;, the following statements are all equivalent:

* &quot;L&quot; is distributive as a meet-semilattice
* &quot;L&quot; is distributive as a join-semilattice
* &quot;L&quot; is a distributive lattice.

Thus any distributive meet-semilattice in which binary joins exist is a distributive lattice. 
A join-semilattice is distributive if and only if the lattice of its ideals (under inclusion) is distributive.

This definition of distributivity allows generalizing some statements about distributive lattices to distributive semilattices.

==Distributivity laws for complete lattices==
For a complete lattice, arbitrary subsets have both infima and suprema and thus infinitary meet and join operations are available. Several extended notions of distributivity can thus be described. For example, for the infinite distributive law, finite meets may distribute over arbitrary joins, i.e.

: formula_5

may hold for all elements &quot;x&quot; and all subsets &quot;S&quot; of the lattice. Complete lattices with this property are called frames, locales or complete Heyting algebras. They arise in connection with pointless topology and Stone duality. This distributive law &quot;is not equivalent&quot; to its dual statement

: formula_6

which defines the class of dual frames or complete co-Heyting algebras.

Now one can go even further and define orders where arbitrary joins distribute over arbitrary meets. Such structures are called completely distributive lattices. However, expressing this requires formulations that are a little more technical. Consider a doubly indexed family {&quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot; | &quot;j&quot; in &quot;J&quot;, &quot;k&quot; in &quot;K&quot;(&quot;j&quot;)} of elements of a complete lattice, and let &quot;F&quot; be the set of choice functions &quot;f&quot; choosing for each index &quot;j&quot; of &quot;J&quot; some index &quot;f&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) in &quot;K&quot;(&quot;j&quot;). A complete lattice is completely distributive if for all such data the following statement holds:

: formula_7

Complete distributivity is again a self-dual property, i.e. dualizing the above statement yields the same class of complete lattices. Completely distributive complete lattices (also called &quot;completely distributive lattices&quot; for short) are indeed highly special structures. See the article on completely distributive lattices.

==Distributive elements in arbitrary lattices==
In an arbitrary lattice, an element &quot;x&quot; is called a &quot;distributive element&quot; if ∀&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;: = 
An element &quot;x&quot; is called a &quot;dual distributive element&quot; if ∀&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;: = 

In a distributive lattice, every element is of course both distributive and dual distributive.
In a non-distributive lattice, there may be elements that are distributive, but not dual distributive (and vice versa).
For example, in the depicted pentagon lattice &quot;N&quot;5, the element &quot;x&quot; is distributive, but not dual distributive, since = = &quot;x&quot; ≠ &quot;z&quot; = = 

In an arbitrary lattice &quot;L&quot;, the following are equivalent:
* &quot;x&quot; is a distributive element;
* The map φ defined by φ(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;y&quot; is a lattice homomorphism from &quot;L&quot; to the upper closure ↑&quot;x&quot; = { &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;: &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; };
* The binary relation Θ&quot;x&quot; on &quot;L&quot; defined by &quot;y&quot; Θ&quot;x&quot; &quot;z&quot; if &quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;z&quot; is a congruence relation, that is, an equivalence relation compatible with ∧ and ∨.

In an arbitrary lattice, if &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 are distributive elements, then so is &quot;x&quot;1 ∨ &quot;x&quot;2.

==Literature==
&quot;Distributivity is a basic concept that is treated in any textbook on lattice and order theory. See the literature given for the articles on order theory and lattice theory. More specific literature includes:&quot;

* G. N. Raney, &quot;Completely distributive complete lattices&quot;, Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, 3: 677 - 680, 1952.

<text>James Hawthorne (April 17, 1913 – April 8, 2004), also known as James Hawthorne Bey and Chief Bey, was an American jazz percussionist and vocalist, a visual artist and folklorist of African traditions. He was also ordained in Nigeria as a Shango Priest. 

==Early life==
Born James Hawthorne in Yemassee, South Carolina, Bey moved with his family to Brooklyn and then to Harlem, where he began playing drums and singing in church choirs. He also served in both the Army and Navy and during World War II, and believed to have another daughter in Germany. He attended cosmetology school.

==Later life and career==
In the 1950s, Chief Bey performed in an international tour of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; along with his wife Louise Hawthorne, starring Leontyne Price and Cab Calloway. He also began a busy recording career, performing with flautist Herbie Mann&#x27;s &quot;At the Village Gate&quot; (1961), Art Blakey&#x27;s &quot;The African Beat&quot; (1962), Ahmed Abdul-Malik&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of Africa&quot; (New Jazz, 1961), as well as albums by Harry Belafonte, Miriam Makeba, Miriam Greaves and Pharoah Sanders, among others. 

He took his stage name after joining the Moorish Science Temple of America, a Muslim sect whose practitioners often add the suffix &quot;Bey&quot; to their names. Then he taught the Shékéré, a West African gourd percussion instrument, at the Griot Institute at Intermediate School 246 in Brooklyn. He performed on Baba Olatunji albums as a vocalist and played African drums and Percussion, Agbé/large Shékéré, Agogo/Bells. As a drum maker, he invented the No Whole Tension Technique of roping skin onto drums.

He worked with Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Nina Simone, Geoffrey Holder, Randy Weston, Reggie Workman, Sonny Morgan, Mongo Santamaria, Eddie Palmieri, John Coltrane.

==Personal life and death==

James Hawthorne died in his Brooklyn home of stomach cancer at the age of 90. His first wife passed 3 years before him, Louise Hawthorne, soprano opera singer traveled the world together, while she sang operas like Aida and Madame Butterfly leaving their 3 children, David, Denise and Carolyn with just their father. His youngest daughter Carolyn who’s on his last CD followed him in death.

His common law wife Barbara Kenyatta (born Barbara Ann Coleman in Harlem on June 9, 1944), was a priestess of Yémaya in the Yoruba religion. She collapsed and died four days later.

<text>The North American monetary union is a theoretical economic and monetary union of three North American countries: Canada, Mexico, and the United States. 

Implementation would involve the three countries giving up their current currency units (the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar, and the Mexican peso) and adopting a new one, created specifically for this purpose (some versions of the theory assume only the United States and Canada would be included). The hypothetical currency for the union is most often referred to as the amero. The concept is modeled on the common European Union currency (the euro).

==Support==
===Canada===
One argument is that it would save up to $3 billion in currency transactions. The same authors also stated that Canada&#x27;s GDP could rise by up to 33% in a 20-year period given the adoption of a single currency.

The idea of a common currency has historically been unpopular in English-speaking Canada, in comparison to the French-speaking province of Quebec where it has received more support. A 2001 opinion poll found that in Quebec over 50% of respondents favored the idea of a shared currency, while in the rest of Canada a majority of respondents opposed the idea.

===Support in other regions===
Lower levels of currency cooperation have been practiced in the Americas before. Some nations such as Argentina and Brazil have at times tied their currency to the U.S. dollar. Some of them, such as Aruba, The Bahamas, Barbados, and the Organisation of the Eastern Caribbean, still do.

The U.S. dollar is officially accepted alongside local currencies in El Salvador (since 2001), Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Peru, Honduras, Panama, Bermuda and Barbados, and in practice two of these countries (El Salvador and Panama) are fully dollarized. In 2000, Ecuador officially adopted the U.S. dollar as its sole currency. In a few areas of Canada, the U.S. dollar can be accepted as currency alongside the Canadian Dollar, particularly in areas near border crossings. An example of this effect is Niagara Falls, Ontario, with large numbers of U.S. tourists (businesses still may not accept U.S. currency depending on their policy). The same is also true for the Canadian Dollar in many U.S. cities near the United States-Canada border.

==Criticisms and problems==

Opposition to a North American monetary union exists high up in the governments on both sides of the Canada–United States border. Herbert Grubel, the first proponent of the amero, admits that American officials show no interest in the topic. He concedes that &quot;there wouldn&#x27;t be very much benefit for the United States&quot; in an amero. Likewise, the Canadian Department of Finance strongly opposes the creation of a common currency with the United States, citing the loss of economic sovereignty. In briefing documents to former Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty, finance officials concluded: A North American common currency would undoubtedly mean for Canada the adoption of the U.S. dollar and U.S. monetary policy. Canada would have to give up its control of domestic inflation and interest rates.

===Trade-offs===
From the point of view of the Canadian and Mexican governments, a major obstacle to the creation of a unified currency is the sheer dominance of the United States in any such union.

A paper from University of California, Santa Barbara puts forward the idea that the United States simply has too many advantages from the &quot;status quo&quot; to move toward a single currency. The United States dollar already acts as a global currency, meaning any transition to a &#x27;new&#x27; currency would risk compromising this position and could cause a shift toward the euro or yen. The U.S. dollar is currently being used in over half of all the world&#x27;s exports, double the total United States foreign trade. The adoption of the amero could threaten the seigniorage that the U.S. currently gains from its dollar. While seignorage would still be gained from the amero, this would be shared among the Bank of Canada, the Federal Reserve, and the Banco de México. Therefore, even if the amero were used just as much as the U.S. dollar, the advantages would be shared among two or more countries, and not exclusively held by the United States.

===Differing economies and debt===
Several problems could arise in regards to macroeconomic management. By submitting to a common currency, the countries would lose considerable autonomy in the management of the currency itself, including the setting of interest rates. Amongst the three potential participants, there is considerable difference in policy which would have to be reconciled.

Debt is a factor affecting currency prices. As of 2010, the debt of the United States continues to increase, while the debt of the Canadian federal government is being reduced. This is a clear advantage for Canadians and it would not be reflected if the currencies were to merge. The importance of commodities also factors into this equation.

A concern with any unified North American currency is the differing economic situations between each country. The Eurozone comprises broadly similar service-based economies based on high public spending (compared to the United States), high taxes and wealth being created by the sale of goods and services. North America on the other hand has three distinct economies; one based mainly on manufacturing, industry and agriculture with a demand for free trade (Mexico), another based on services such as retail, with higher taxes and low public spending (United States), and a third based on services with higher taxes and higher public spending, with a large sector in primary goods such as oil, mining and lumber (Canada).

Some observers blamed the Eurozone crisis partly on a lack of effective fiscal union. The Budget of the European Union is relatively small compared to the budgets of the Eurozone countries, which are set independently. Leading up to the crisis, some countries incurred more debt than the unenforced EU guidelines called for. Due to the centralized monetary union, countries experiencing problems were unable to apply local monetary policy to recover, and destabilized the currency which is also used by more economically healthy countries. The national budgets and debt levels of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, on the other hand, are also set completely independently, which could cause similar problems in a situation where monetary policy was centralized.

In contrast, the economies of the various states of the United States are strongly integrated. Internally, the U.S. also has strong fiscal federalism - all but one of the fifty states have a balanced budget amendment, and the federal budget is large compared to state budgets, resulting in effective federal stabilization of the currency and national economy.

===Conservative and protectionist allegations===
In November 2006, Lou Dobbs alleged on his CNN program that a &quot;North American Union&quot; was being implemented, without the knowledge and consent of the people who would be affected by the Union. The episode also briefly mentioned various claims about a common currency. The report focused on uncertainty prior to Felipe Calderón taking office as President of Mexico in late 2006, but never provided any substantive evidence to support this claim. The report suggested the union would be implemented by 2010, a deadline which came and went without such a union being implemented.

In 2006, Conservative Caucus Chairman Howard Phillips, WND columnist and author Jerome Corsi, activist Phyllis Schlafly, among others, reportedly formed a coalition against a North American Union. On January 22, 2007, Republican Representatives Virgil Goode of Virginia, Tom Tancredo of Colorado, Walter Jones of North Carolina, and Ron Paul of Texas were among the 43 federal lawmakers who introduced H. CON. RES. 40, a resolution advocated by the coalition, that expressed: The sense of Congress that the United States should not engage in the construction of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Superhighway System or enter into a North American Union (NAU) with Mexico or Canada.

==Amero coins==
In August 2007, rumors and conspiracy theories began circulating across the Internet regarding alleged United States Treasury-issued amero coins.

The inspiration behind these rumors may have been the posting of images of medallions created by coin designer Daniel Carr. Carr, who designed the New York and Rhode Island 2001 statehood quarters, sells medals and tokens of his own design on his commercial website, &quot;Designs Computed&quot; (also known as &quot;DC Coin&quot;). Among his designs are a series of gold, silver and copper fantasy issues of amero coins ranging in denomination from one to one thousand. The medallions have the legend &quot;Union of North America&quot; on the back with his company&#x27;s logo, a stylized &quot;DC&quot;, in small type. Concerning his amero designs, he mentions on his website:
My goal with these coins is not to endorse a Union of North America or a common Amero currency. I fully support the United States Constitution, and I would not welcome (in any form) a diminishment of its provisions. I expect that these coins will help make more people aware of the issue and the possible ramifications. I leave it up to others to decide if they are in favor of, or against a North American Union. And I encourage citizens to voice their approval or disapproval of government plans that impact them.

Unauthorized postings of images taken from his website have been reposted widely across the Internet, often being used as supposed &quot;proof&quot; of the amero coinage. Notably, white nationalist and former Internet radio talk show host Hal Turner ran a full article on his website about the &quot;amero coin&quot;, claiming to have arranged for a United States Government minted &quot;amero&quot; to be smuggled out of the United States Department of the Treasury by an employee of that organization.

Following Turner&#x27;s assertions of federal minting of ameros, a web site marketing the curio coins released a statement debunking Turner&#x27;s claims of a government cover up regarding Daniel Carr&#x27;s amero products. The urban legend investigating Web site &quot;Snopes&quot; also ran a further counter to Turner&#x27;s claims, stating &quot;neither the U.S. Mint nor the U.S. Treasury has a hand in creating these &#x27;Ameros&#x27;. These coins are merely collectibles offered to the buying public by a private company in the business of manufacturing such curiosities.&quot;

Carr&#x27;s designs had been available through his website since 2005, and according to a WHOIS search at Network Solutions, the domain &quot;dc-coin.com&quot; was registered by Daniel Carr on September 27, 2005.

In October 2008, Hal Turner released a video showing an apparent 20 amero coin, with claims that shipments of the currency had been sent to China. Yet the coin in Hal Turner&#x27;s video is identical to a medallion on Daniel Carr&#x27;s &quot;dc-coin&quot; website, listed as &quot;UNA 2007 20 Ameros, Copper, Satin Finish&quot;.

==Amero bills==
On December 3, 2008, Hal Turner&#x27;s blog featured what he claimed were genuine &quot;amero bills&quot;. He displayed photographs of purported 20, 50, and 100 amero notes. Turner did not identify how he obtained the images, saying only that &quot;once again, my sources have come through&quot;. He claimed that the &quot;new currency is already being printed and quietly distributed around the world&quot;. The web site Snopes.com suggested Turner was &quot;beating the same tired, apocryphal drum&quot; with his new claim. These images are art from the Flickr user aleatorysort, who created them as an artistic political commentary, and were therefore not actual currency.

<text>The Young Conservatives (YC) is the youth wing of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom for members aged 25 and under. The organisation shares the same values and policies as its parent political party with branches being an integrated part of local associations. College and university branches are not included, but run independently.

==History==
===Origins===

The &quot;Junior Imperial and Constitutional League&quot; was formed in 1906 with objectives to encourage practical political work and organisation among young people in Britain. Junior Associations were set up in each Parliamentary Division and throughout the British Empire, co-operating closely with Conservative and Unionist Associations with an ambition to create Imperial unity and to further the Conservative and Unionist cause.

In 1925, the &quot;Young Britons Organisation&quot; was formed as the juvenile branch of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations. It closed down during the Second World War.

After the Conservative Party suffered a catastrophic defeat in the 1945 general election, the &quot;Young Britons Organisation&quot; was reformed to cater for both boys and girls aged 6–16, while the &quot;Young Conservatives&quot; was set up to cater for an older age group.

===Young Conservatives (1906–1998)===

The Young Conservatives attracted a large following and, by 1955, claimed a membership of 150,000. This made it the largest political youth movement in a liberal democracy, though not all its members were strongly motivated by politics. A large part of its appeal lay in its social activities that brought young people together in a socially safe environment. Countless middle-class British couples met at the &quot;YCs&quot; dances, rambles, and charity events in the 1950s. In the period between it published a magazine entitled &quot;Impact&quot;. One large factor in the rapid decline in membership was the factionalism that gripped the movement in the early 1980s, first manifesting itself during Eric Pickles&#x27; chairmanship.

... his year in office was not without its difficulties. The radical right was a growing force in young Tory politics. The S.D.P. had recently been founded and disillusioned liberals in both the Labour and Conservative parties were deserting to the new &quot;centre&quot; party. At the Young Conservative&#x27;s national conference in Eastbourne in February 1981, Pickles presided over a growing split in the ranks, particularly between northern &quot;liberals&quot; and southern &quot;right-wingers&quot;.

From that point onwards, a battle for leadership ensued between the moderates (&#x27;One Nation&#x27; Tories, termed &#x27;Wets&#x27;) and &#x27;Drys&#x27; (Right-wingers from the Monday Club and Libertarians). The moderates attempted to play up the image problems the Young Monday Club and the Libertarians would present to the organisation. Publications such as the North West Area YC Rag Mag, the Sin, featured a page in 1985 attacking the Young Monday Club image. The 1989 Sin edition attempted to target the growing libertarian threat by featuring &#x27;Loonie Libs.&#x27; 

The capture of the Young Conservatives by the &#x27;Dries&#x27; in 1989 led to increasing image problems as the more right-wing stance became pilloried in the media. &quot;The very term &#x27;Young Conservative&#x27; has actually entered popular culture in a derogatory way being used by comedians to lampoon a certain type of person.&quot;
The BBC series &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;, featured a sketch entitled &#x27;Young Conservative of the Year&#x27;, the basis of which was an arrogant, right-wing and upper class Young Conservative competing in a mock contest on the reactionary and authoritarian content of his speech in a mock contest. In the BBC series &quot;Harry Enfield and Chums&quot;, Harry Enfield played a character called &#x27;Tory Boy&#x27;, an arrogant and reactionary right-wing Young Conservative.

Membership fell from a peak of 250,000 to just a few thousand, while the rival organisation Conservative Students claimed significantly more members. The end came in 1998 when Conservative leader William Hague announced the closure of Young Conservatives and the launch of a new organisation, Conservative Future.

====Past Chairmen====

The National Chairmen of the Young Conservatives were associated with the moderate (One Nation - Tory Reform Group) tradition of the Conservative Party until the 1989 election, which resulted in the defeat of the moderate incumbent. Until then leadership had been from the Conservative party &#x27;left&#x27; with only a couple of exceptions. Notable exceptions to the &#x27;One Nation&#x27; moderate leadership were David Atkinson MP, who was a committed Christian campaigner and backer of corporal punishment, and Sir Fergus Montgomery MP, a supporter of apartheid South Africa and another corporal punishment advocate. Otherwise, the YCs produced a long line of Tory reformers, until the moderate faction was finally defeated in the late 1980s, although Clive Landa&#x27;s defeat of Christopher Horne (the chairman of the Hyde Park Tories) in the 1973 election in Greater London was far closer than was expected, even by the supporters of both candidates.

====Past Vice Chairmen====
A large number of Vice Chairmen have gone on to other prominent positions in the Party and hold public office at local and national level. These include: Patrick McLoughlin MP, Robert Atkins MP, Kenneth Lane, Anthea McIntyre MEP and Robin Squire MP.

===Conservative Future (1998–2016)===

In 1998, Conservative Future was launched as the new youth wing following major reforms by William Hague, who was elected as the honorary president of Conservative Future in 2012. By 2006, it was the largest political organisation on British campuses, and the estimated membership, including members on campuses and through constituency associations, may once have totalled 20,000.

On 19 November 2015, the entire executive of the organisation was suspended, and the youth wing taken under direct control by the Conservative Party. The national Conservative Future was eventually disbanded; however, Conservative Future Scotland continued to function.

===Young Conservatives (2018–present)===
In 2018, following the appointment of Ben Bradley as Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party for youth and with a focus on young members, the party announced at its spring forum it was relaunching a youth branch under the original name &#x27;Young Conservatives&#x27;.

The structure of Young Conservative branches will be integrated with local Associations and into the wider voluntary party with officers being elected by members of the association. University YC branches will operate independently. The organisation aims to increase youth ownership and engagement in local associations by focusing on activities which are tangible for the success of the party. After the publication of the Chequers Brexit white paper Ben Bradley tendered his resignation as Vice Chairman for youth and was subsequently succeeded by Tom Pursglove. Pursglove was replaced by Nigel Huddleston in February 2019, and Pursglove was replaced by Andrew Bowie in July 2019 after Boris Johnson took office.

<text>Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov (; 17 October 1906 – 7 October 1993) was a leading Soviet Russian mathematician and geophysicist known for important contributions to topology, functional analysis, mathematical physics, and ill-posed problems. He was also one of the inventors of the magnetotellurics method in geophysics. Other transliterations of his surname include &quot;Tychonoff&quot;, &quot;Tychonov&quot;, &quot;Tihonov&quot;, &quot;Tichonov&quot;.

== Biography ==
Born in Gzhatsk, he studied at the Moscow State University where he received a Ph.D. in 1927 under the direction of Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov. In 1933 he was appointed as a professor at Moscow State University. He became a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences on 29 January 1939 and a full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences on 1 July 1966.

== Research work ==
Tikhonov worked in a number of different fields in mathematics. He made important contributions to topology, functional analysis, mathematical physics, and certain classes of ill-posed problems. Tikhonov regularization, one of the most widely used methods to solve ill-posed inverse problems, is named in his honor. He is best known for his work on topology, including the metrization theorem he proved in 1926, and the Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, which states that every product of arbitrarily many compact topological spaces is again compact. In his honor, completely regular topological spaces are also named &quot;Tychonoff spaces&quot;.

In mathematical physics, he proved the fundamental uniqueness theorems for the heat equation and studied Volterra integral equations.

He founded the theory of asymptotic analysis for differential equations with small parameter in the leading derivative.

== Organizer work ==
Tikhonov played the leading role in founding the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics of Moscow State University and served as its first dean during the period of 1970–1990.

== Awards ==
Tikhonov received numerous honors and awards for his work, including the Lenin Prize (1966) and the Hero of Socialist Labor (1954, 1986).

<doc id="616086" wikidata="Q7336234" url="?curid=616086" title="Risk 2210 A.D.">
<text>Risk 2210 A.D. is a 2–5 player board game by Avalon Hill that is a futuristic variant of the classic board game &quot;Risk&quot;. &quot;Risk 2210 A.D.&quot; was designed by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness and first released in 2001. In 2002, it won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Board Game of 2001&quot;.

==Components==
The boxed set includes:
* 1 Earth Game Board, including land territories and water colonies.
* 1 Moon Game Board
* 5 different colored sets of playing pieces:
** MODs (Machines of Destruction) in denomination sizes of 1, 3, and 5.
** 4 Space Stations
** The 5 commanders
* Energy in denominations of 1s and 5s
* 5 command card decks (1 for each type of commander)
* 3 territory card decks, 1 for each type of territory (land, water, moon)
* 5 Turn Order Markers
* 4 Devastation Markers
* 1 Score Chart
* 6 and 8 sided dice, three of each black (attack dice), and two of each white (defense dice), 10 total dice

===Box redesign===
&quot;2210 A.D.&quot; originally came packaged in a rectangular boxed set with a playing board that folded into fourths. At some point the design changed to a square, like the packaging for &quot;Risk Godstorm&quot;. The board in the square box folds into sixths, the cardboard playing pieces are one-sided as opposed to being printed on both sides as they were for the rectangular box, and the Moon was printed on much thinner cardstock.

==Gameplay==

===Setup===
Before the game, 4 cards are randomly selected from the land territory deck. Each of the 4 territory cards drawn will have a &quot;devastation marker&quot; placed on its corresponding territory on the earth game board. These territories are impassable for the rest of the game.

Each player is allocated 3 energy chips before the game begins. The number of armies allocated to each player and the process of claiming territories is identical to the Standard Risk board game, but the armies are called MODs; therefore, number of MODs allocated to each player at the beginning of the game depends on the number of players. If three people are playing, each player counts out 35 MODs; four players, 30 MODs; five players, 25 MODs. Players then take turns claiming land territories by placing a 1.0 MOD on an unoccupied land territory until all the land territories are occupied. Players then take turns placing their remaining armies on their claimed land territories. Following MOD placement, each player places a space station, a land commander, and a diplomat on any of their claimed territories.

Water and Lunar territories may not be claimed at the beginning of the game. Devastated land territories can not be claimed or occupied at any point during the game.

===Determining turn order===
The game is limited to five rounds called years. At the beginning of each year, players use energy chips they have accumulated to bid for turn order through a first-price sealed-bid auction format. Players secretly bid energy by placing the corresponding energy chips they would bid into a closed hand. Players open their hands containing their bids simultaneously. The highest bidder selects which turn order they want, then the next highest bidder, and so on. The highest bidder may select any turn the player wants; the player is not limited to &quot;first.&quot;

===Ending game===
After each player has completed their turn, a year is considered to have passed. At the end of year 5, each player&#x27;s score is calculated based on the number of territories the player owns, colonies the player holds, and the number of colony influence cards the player has the commanders to activate. The player with the highest score wins.

==Player turn==

===Turn order overview===
At the beginning of each player&#x27;s turn, based on the number of countries the player owns and whole continents the player holds, the player gains additional MODs and energy. The player places the MODs and then has the opportunity to buy additional commanders, cards, and space stations. Then the player may play command cards that they have sufficient energy to activate. Next comes the attack phase in which, if the player successfully takes three contested territories, the player receives one bonus energy and one bonus command card. After the attack phase, the player may move one group of units from any one of the player&#x27;s territories to any other territory the player occupies, so long as both territories are connected by a path of their own territories.

===Collection of energy and deployment of MODs===
Similar to the obtaining reinforcements in classic Risk, players receive additional MODs and Energy at the beginning of their turn. The number of MODs received is a function of the number of territories a player owns, a player&#x27;s colony bonuses, and the number of space stations a player controls. Players divide their total number of territories, regardless of type, by three and receive that number of MODs rounded down to the nearest integer. If this result is less than three, round up to three MODs. The Score Chart is designed to aide players in this task. Additionally, players receive colony bonuses by occupying all the territories in a land, water, or lunar colony at the beginning of their turn. This is similar to continental bonuses in classic Risk. These MODs are dispersed among the player&#x27;s controlled territories as they choose. 

Players receive Energy equal to the number of MODs received at this point in the turn.

Players also place one MOD on each territory that contains a Space Station they control.

===Commanders and space stations===
After players have collected energy and deployed their MODs, players may purchase commanders and space stations. Commanders cost three energy while space stations cost five energy.

One of the biggest differences from classic &quot;Risk&quot; is the addition of commanders: land, naval, space, nuclear, and diplomat. These fill a number of roles. Their most basic function is to act as an improved army unit, enabling players to roll eight-sided dice rather than the typical six-sided ones. This is explained more thoroughly in the next section. Space and naval commanders allow movement into Moon or Water territories respectively.

===Command cards===
Perhaps one of the most important functions of the commanders is allowing the purchase and use of commander cards. After players have purchased and placed their commanders or space station, players may purchase a maximum of four commander cards at a cost of one energy per card. Players may only purchase commander cards if they have the corresponding commander in play. The text of the commander card will illustrate when the card may, or must, be played. Many of the Commander cards have energy costs that must be paid if the card is to be put into play.

Each commander deck adds its own strategic elements to the game. Diplomat cards tend to be low cost cards that increase unit mobility or place a negative effect on other players. Land Cards tend to be low cost cards that increase the number of MODs available to a player. Naval cards tends to have the emphasize energy gain. The nuclear deck contains relatively higher cost cards with sweeping global effects. Space Cards tend to be a mixture of the elements already described.
If an Armageddon card is played, then even if your nuclear commander is destroyed mid turn you can finish playing the nuclear card.

===Invading territories===
Three major elements differentiate invasion in Risk 2210 A.D. from classic Risk: limitations in which territories may be invaded, how commanders affect dice, and how space stations affect dice. Players may only invade Water or Lunar territories if they have the corresponding commander in play. Additionally Lunar territories can only be invaded from the Earth game board by a territory containing a space station. Only three of the territories on the Moon game board can be invaded into from the Earth game board. These are the Sea of Crisis, Tycho, and Bay of Dew. Players can not invade from the Moon to Earth without the &quot;Invading Earth&quot; card found in the Space Deck.

If no commanders are attacking or defending a territory, play continues identically to classical Risk. However, defending players may defend their territories using an 8-sided die instead of a 6-sided die if a commander is present in that territory. If two commanders are present in a defending territory, the defender may substitute both of the 6-sided dice used in defense for two 8-sided dice. This is true regardless of commander type for defending.

Substitution of 6-sided dice with 8-sided dice for invading players is contingent on the type of territory that player is invading into/from and the type of commander that player is invading into. The following table is provided in the Risk 2210 A.D. Gameplay Manual.

Players do not have to remove commanders if they suffer a loss while using an 8-sided die. Players may remove MODs from their corresponding invading or defending territories first. Commanders are removed from a defending player if an invading player destroys all MODs in an defending player&#x27;s territory. Commanders may be repurchased.

All units in space stations, regardless of type, defend with 8-sided dice. If a territory with a space station is captured by an invading player, that space station is replaced with another of the invading player&#x27;s same color.

Similar to classic Risk, if an invading player captured three or more contested territories, territories defended by another player, the invading player receives one energy and one commander card. Commander cards received this way can only be chosen from Commanders that the invading player currently has in play.

===Fortifying===
A player may end their turn by fortifying. To fortify, players move as many units as they desire from one territory, and only one territory, to another territory that is connected at all points by territories that player occupies. Players need not own a space or naval commander to fortify into lunar or water territories. However, to fortify from a territory on the Earth game board to a territory on the Moon game board, one of the connected territories must be a space station.

==Prominent differences from classic &quot;Risk&quot;==
* Only five players (classic &quot;Risk&quot; seats six)
* Addition of water and moon territories
* Addition of commanders (land, naval, space, nuclear, diplomat)
* Command card decks corresponding to each of the five commanders
* Players earn and spend &quot;energy&quot; to obtain commanders, cards, and space stations and to activate some command cards
* Players can roll an 8-sided die in some instances
* Armies are not acquired through card trading
* The game is only 5 years (turns) long; the winner is the player with highest score at the end of the last year
* Players bid energy to determine turn order rather than following the same order determined by a dice from the beginning of the game.

===Territories===
Geographically, the map is nearly identical to the classic &quot;Risk&quot; map. It has the same forty-two territories as before, but they have somewhat different names; Greenland, for example, is now the Exiled States of America. There is a tendency for large territories to be given the name of a present-day microstate (Andorra, Djibouti, Hong Kong, and Lesotho). Additionally, a few connections are removed from the Earth board that are present in classic Risk board; the picture shows that Egypt is the only African country to have a connection with Middle East.

Thirteen water territories divided into five colonies and fourteen lunar territories divided into three colonies have been added. Similar to continental bonuses, if a player controls all the territories in a lunar or water colony at the beginning of their turn, they will receive additional MODs and energy that turn.

The map changes each game: Before any units are placed, four Devastation markers are positioned randomly on the board. Those four territories are nuclear wastelands that are impassable and uninhabitable during the game.

===Commanders and cards===

One of the biggest differences from classic &quot;Risk&quot; is the addition of commanders: land, naval, space, nuclear, and diplomat. These fill a number of roles. Card play can shift the balance of power rapidly. Players can only buy four cards at a time, and only for commanders in play. Like the new avenues of movement, cards open up the board by making no position impregnable, no attack a certainty. With cards in use, the game is more fluid and positions are constantly shifting. There is a separate deck of cards for each type of commander. Perhaps the most devastating card attacks are enabled by the nuclear commander: Playing a nuclear card has the potential to destroy all the armies on an entire continent.

===Energy===
Energy also has a strategic importance. It is used to buy cards, to bring commanders and space stations into play, to bid for the most advantageous place in the turn order, and to play certain cards. Each round, players bid energy for the right to choose when they want to take their turns. But players who spend too much energy one turn may find themselves playing at a disadvantage the next turn, or even for the rest of the game.

===Turn limit===
&quot;Risk 2210 A.D.&quot; includes a five-turn limit, although it is possible to play as in normal &quot;Risk&quot; with unlimited turns. Whoever controls the most territories (and bonuses) at the end of the fifth year wins.

The game includes the necessary equipment and cards for playing the classic version of &quot;Risk&quot;.

==Renamed territories==
A map of the original Risk board, which does not contain the US Pacific regions, and has different oceanic connections. In more recent game boards, the connection between East Africa and the Middle East has been removed. There is also a moon map board used in Risk 2210 A.D. Note: there does not appear to be a bridge between the Exiled States of America and Canada on the actual artwork. Territories available in the edition with are shown in quotes. Lunar territories (not pictured) are noted by an asterisk.

==Expansions==
Avalon Hill has released a number of expansions for the &quot;2210 A.D.&quot; game. Used as Tournament awards, these expansions were originally available only to retailers and have not been released commercially. To date, there are four &quot;official&quot; expansions, under the name &quot;Frontline&quot;. A number of unofficial expansions have also been created by fans, covering such themes as terrorism, aerial assault, zombies, Antarctica and Godstorm-style relics

List of official Expansions:

* Frontline season one, Mars Expansion: The &quot;Mars Expansion&quot; introduces a newly terraformed Mars as a playable battlefield, featuring its own territories and unique strategic opportunities. Players can deploy forces to Mars, gaining access to new routes and resources that influence the global conflict.
* Frontline season two, Tech Commander: The Tech Commander Expansion adds a sixth commander type, the Tech Commander, alongside a new 20-card deck. This expansion enhances technological advancements, providing powerful upgrades and special abilities that can alter the course of battle.
* Frontline season three, Factions: The Factions Expansion introduces six distinct factions, each with unique abilities and starting conditions. This addition increases replayability and strategic depth, as players must adapt to their faction’s strengths and weaknesses.
* Frontline season four, Invasion of the Giant Amoebas: The Invasion of the Giant Amoebas expansion adds a new threat to the battlefield. Giant amoebas act as a neutral force, spreading across the map and disrupting player plans. This unpredictable element forces players to adapt their strategies to survive and conquer.

==Video game version==
A video game version of &quot;Risk 2210 A.D.&quot; called &quot;Invade Earth&quot; was created by Jonathan Crosmer using Java. It also allowed users to play the original &quot;Risk&quot;, &quot;Risk: Godstorm&quot; and a few other variations of the game. Players could also network across the Internet to play with others. &quot;Invade Earth&quot; ceased to function in February 2018 due to security updates to Java.

== Reception ==
The game has been reviewed in an entry for &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, with the reviewer noting that it is &quot;an excellent example of a game that is easy to learn and hard to master&quot; and that the game is &quot;more fluid than the original &quot;Risk&quot;; no position is impregnable, and no strategy is optimal&quot;.

<doc id="616087" wikidata="Q269880" url="?curid=616087" title="Ferrari Enzo">
<text>The Ferrari Enzo (Type F140), officially marketed as Enzo Ferrari, is a mid-engine sports car manufactured by Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari and named after the company&#x27;s founder, Enzo Ferrari. It was developed in 2002 using Formula One technology, such as a carbon-fibre body, Formula One-style automated-shift manual transmission, and carbon fibre-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite disc brakes, as well as technologies not allowed in Formula One, such as active aerodynamics. The Enzo&#x27;s F140 B V12 engine was also the first of a new generation for Ferrari. The Enzo generates substantial amounts of downforce through its front underbody flaps, small adjustable rear spoiler and rear diffuser, which work in conjunction to produce of downforce at and of downforce at , before decreasing to at top speed.

==Production and development==
The Enzo was designed by Ken Okuyama, the then Pininfarina head of design, and initially announced at the 2002 Paris Motor Show with a limited production run of 399 units. The company sent invitations to existing customers, specifically, those who had previously bought the F40 and F50. In 2004, the 400th production car was built and donated to the Vatican for charity, which was later sold at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction for US$1.1 million. A total of 498 units were built. Three development mules were built: M1, M2, and M3. Each mule utilised the bodywork of a 348, a model which had been succeeded by two generations of mid-engined V8 sports cars—the F355 and the 360 Modena—by the time the mules were built. The third mule was offered for auction alongside the 400th Enzo in June 2005, selling for €195,500 (US$236,300).

==Specifications==
===Engine===

The engine in the Enzo is longitudinally mounted, and the car has a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout with a 44%/56% front/rear weight distribution. The powerplant is Ferrari&#x27;s F140B naturally aspirated 65° V12 engine with DOHC 4 valves per cylinder, variable valve timing and Bosch Motronic ME7 fuel injection with a displacement of generating a power output of at 7,800 rpm and of torque at 5,500 rpm. The redline is 8,200 rpm.

===Suspension, gearbox and brakes===
The Enzo has an automated manual transmission, known as the F1 gearbox, using paddle-shifters to control an automatically actuated electrohydraulic clutch and shifting mechanism, with LED lights on the steering wheel telling the driver when to change gears. The gearbox has a shift time of 150 milliseconds and was built by Graziano Trasmissioni. The transmission was a first-generation &quot;clutchless&quot; design from the late 1990s, and there have been complaints about its abrupt shifting. The Enzo has four-wheel independent suspension with push-rod-actuated shock absorbers, which can be adjusted from the cabin, complemented with anti-roll bars at the front and rear. The Enzo uses wheels and has Brembo disc brakes. The wheels are held by a single lug nut and fitted with Bridgestone Potenza Scuderia RE050A tyres.

===Performance===
One-way downhill with 1-foot rollout the Enzo can accelerate to in 3.14 seconds and can reach in 6.6 seconds. The ¼-mile (~400 m) time is about 11 seconds, on skidpad it has reached 1.05&quot;g&quot;, and the top speed has been recorded to be as high as . It is rated at in the city, on the highway and combined. &quot;Evo&quot; tested the Enzo on the famed Nordschleife Circuit and ran a 7:25.21 lap time. The Enzo in the test had a broken electronic damper. They also tested it at Bedford Autodrome West circuit, where it recorded a 1:21.3 lap time, which is 1.1 seconds slower than the Porsche Carrera GT, but faster than the Litchfield Type-25.

==Accolades==
In 2004, American magazine &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named the Ferrari Enzo number three on their list of Top Sports Cars of the 2000s. American magazine &quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; named the Enzo as number four in their list of the ten &quot;Greatest Ferraris of all time&quot;. The Ferrari Enzo was also described as one of the &quot;Fifty Ugliest Cars of the Past 50 Years&quot;, as &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; cited its superfluous curves and angles as too flashy, particularly the V-shaped hood, scooped-out doors, and bulbous windshield.

==Other media==
Before being unveiled at the Paris Motor Show, the show car was flown from Italy to the United States to be filmed in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;. It was driven on a beach by actress Demi Moore. After filming was complete, the Enzo was flown to France to be at the Motor Show.

===Ferrari FXX===

Ferrari decided to use some of the technology developed for the Enzo in a small-scale program to get more feedback from certain customers for use in future car design as well as their racing program. The core of this program is the Ferrari FXX, introduced in 2005. It was loosely based on the Enzo&#x27;s design with a highly tuned 6.3-liter version of the Enzo&#x27;s engine generating a power output of approximately . The gearbox is specially developed for the car as well as the tires (custom-designed for this car by Bridgestone) along with the brakes (developed by Brembo). In addition, the car is fitted with extensive data-recording and telemetry systems to allow Ferrari to record the car&#x27;s behavior. This information is used by Ferrari to develop their future sports cars. The FXX can do in 2.8 seconds.

Like the Enzo, the car was sold to specially selected existing clients of Ferrari only. The initial price was €1.3 million. Unlike the Enzo, the clients did not take delivery of the car themselves. Rather, it is maintained and kept by Ferrari and available for the client&#x27;s use on various circuits as arranged by Ferrari and also during private track sessions. A famous example of this is when Ferrari allowed Top Gear to send it around their test track in 2009; however, as Ben Collins (then portraying The Stig) was not a specially selected client, Michael Schumacher was selected to wear the white race suit. In the FXX, he set a then new lap record of 1:10.7, a record which was then immediately taken off as the car is not expected to be suitable for road use. The Ferrari FXX program was continued until 2009 with the Ferrari FXX Evoluzione.

===Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina===
Italian design studio Pininfarina had wanted to make a special one-off sports car based on the Enzo Ferrari flagship and was looking for a backer. After sending out feelers to its clients, American Ferrari collector James Glickenhaus eventually agreed to back the project by commissioning his car as a modern homage to great Ferrari sports racing cars such as the 330 P3/4, 512 S, 312 P, and 333 SP on the last unregistered U.S.-spec Enzo chassis. The car was named the Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina, and retains the Enzo&#x27;s drivetrain and vehicle identification number. The car was unveiled at the 2006 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance and appeared in the September issue of &quot;Car and Driver&quot;. After its unveiling at Pebble Beach, the P4/5 returned to Europe for high-speed testing, press days, and an appearance at the Paris Auto Show in September 2006. Upon seeing the P4/5, the then Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo felt that the car deserved to be officially badged as a Ferrari and along with Andrea Pininfarina and James Glickenhaus agreed that its official name would be &quot;Ferrari P 4/5 by Pininfarina&quot;. Ted West wrote an article in &quot;Car and Driver&quot; about how this came to be &quot;The Beast of Turin&quot;.

===Maserati MC12===
The Maserati MC12 is a two-seat mid-engine sports car that is a derivative of the Enzo Ferrari developed by Maserati while under the control of Ferrari. It was developed specifically to be homologated for racing in the FIA GT Championship, with a minimum requirement of 25 road versions to be produced before the car could be allowed to compete. Maserati built 50 units, all of which were presold to selected customers. A track-only variation, the MC12 Corsa was later developed, similar to the Ferrari FXX. The Maserati MC12 has the same engine, chassis, and gearbox as the Enzo but the only externally visible component from the Enzo is the windshield. Due to this, the Maserati MC12 is sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Second Generation Ferrari Enzo&quot;. The MC12 is slower in acceleration (0–100 km/h or 0–62 mph being achieved in 3.8 seconds), and has a lower top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph) due to engine tuning and less drag coefficient (due to a sharper nose and smoother curves) than the Enzo Ferrari; however, the MC12 has lapped race tracks faster than the Enzo before, specifically on the UK motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, and the Nurbürgring Nordschleife (at colder outside temperatures). This could be attributed to the MC12&#x27;s Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tires which have more grip than the Enzo&#x27;s Bridgestone Scuderia tires.

===Maserati Birdcage 75th===
The Maserati Birdcage 75th is a concept car created by automobile manufacturer Maserati and designed by Pininfarina, as a celebration of Pininfarina&#x27;s 75th anniversary, and was introduced at the 2005 Geneva Auto Show. It is an evolution of the MC12 and draws inspiration from the Maserati Tipo Birdcages of the 1960s. There were rumors that Maserati was going to produce the car as the MC13, for which Maserati confirmed to have plans, but they were cancelled due to problems with Pininfarina giving Maserati total control over the design of the car.

===Maserati MC12 Versione Corse===

The Maserati MC12 Versione Corse is a variant of the MC12 intended for racetrack use. In contrast to the race version of the MC12, of which street-legal versions were produced for homologation purposes, the MC12 Versione Corse is intended for private use, albeit restricted to the track, as the Versione Corse&#x27;s modifications make it illegal to drive on the road.

The Versione Corse was developed directly from the MC12 GT1, which won the 2005 FIA GT Manufacturers Cup. The car was released in mid-2006, &quot;in response to the customer demand to own the MC12 racing car and fueled by the growth in track days, where owners can drive their cars at high speeds in the safety of a race track&quot;, as stated by Edward Butler, General Manager for Maserati in Australia and New Zealand. In similar fashion to the Ferrari FXX, although the owners are private individuals, Maserati is responsible for the storage, upkeep, and maintenance of the cars, and they are only driven on specially organized track days. Unlike the FXX, the MC12 Corsa is not intended for research and development, and is used only for entertainment. A single MC12 Versione Corse has been modified by its owner to make it street-legal the conversion was carried out by German tuning firm Edo Competition.

Only twelve MC12 Versione Corses were sold to selected customers, each of whom paid €1 million (US$1.47 million) for the privilege. Another three vehicles were produced for testing and publicity purposes. The Versione Corse shares its engine with the MC12 GT1; the power plant produces at 8,000 rpm, more than the road-legal MC12. The MC12 Versione Corse shares the GT1&#x27;s shortened nose, which was a requirement for entry into the American Le Mans Series. The car was available in a single standard colour, named &quot;Blue Victory&quot;, though the car&#x27;s paint could be customized upon request. The MC12 Versione Corse possesses steel/carbon racing brakes, but is not fitted with an anti-lock braking system.

===Ferrari Millechili===

Millechili, Italian for &quot;one thousand&quot; (mille) &quot;kilograms&quot; (chili), is the code name for a prototype sports car to be manufactured by Ferrari. It was a lightweight version of the Enzo Ferrari that would borrow features from Formula One race cars, using the F430&#x27;s aluminium space frame on a wheelbase. The hybrid power train utilising a V10 engine used in the car would exceed . The car was mainly a technological concept with no intention of production. The Millechili was developed in collaboration with the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, faculty of Mechanical Engineering. Millechili Lab is a cross-project in which students are working on light-weight car design.

===Ferrari FXX Evoluzione===

The Ferrari FXX program continued until 2009. The car continued to be improved under the Evoluzione kit, which continually adjusts specifics to generate more power and quicker gear changes, along with reducing the car&#x27;s aerodynamic drag. The V12 engine under the Evoluzione kit generates at 9,500 rpm and enables the car to accelerate from in 2.5 seconds. Certain changes were made to the gearbox in order to reduce the shift time to 60 milliseconds per shift, a reduction of 20 milliseconds over the original FXX. The car also underwent aerodynamic changes and improvements to the traction control system were made in order to make the car more responsive around the track. The modifications also allow the Evoluzione to reach a top speed of .

<text>Sweden is covered by 68% forest. In southern Sweden, human interventions started to have a significant impact on broadleaved forests around 2000 years ago, where the first evidence of extensive agriculture has been found. Recent studies describe a long-term process of borealization in south-central Sweden starting at the beginning of the Holocene where oak (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.) and alder (&quot;Alnus&quot; spp.) seemingly started to decline around 2000 years ago due to a decrease in temperature. At the same time the Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;) started to emigrate from the north, and the European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;) emigrated from the south of Europe. Though, as a primary result of production forest management at the middle of the twentieth century, &quot;P. abies&quot; and Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;) covers together around 75% of southern Sweden actual standing tree volume.

==Economic use of forests==
Wood from the forest has long been used in the southern part of the country and in early agricultural areas as a source of fuel and as a building material. Wood was essential for Sweden&#x27;s early mining industry, as it was used to produce charcoal for processing ore. Other important forestry products included wood pitch, tar, and potash, which were produced for export beginning in the Middle Ages.

Forestry work expanded to Norrland beginning in the early 19th century, and the resulting cleared areas became the site of small farms and pastures. Extensive logging resulted in the development of a sawmill industry, which produced lumber for export. This expansion continued until 1905. The Statistical Yearbook of Forestry chronicles the state of the forestry industry since the 1940s and is the responsibility of the Swedish Forest Agency.

<text>Since Canadian Confederation in 1867, there have been several proposals for new Canadian provinces and territories. Since 1982, the current Constitution of Canada requires an amendment ratified by seven provincial legislatures representing at least half of the national population for the creation of a new province while the creation of a new territory requires only an act of Parliament. Because opening up the constitution to amendment could entice provinces to demand other changes too in exchange for such support, this is seen to be a politically unfeasible option. The newest province, Newfoundland and Labrador, joined Canada in 1949 by an act of the British Parliament before the 1982 patriation of the constitution.

==Movements inside Canada==

There have been movements to create new provinces and territories inside the borders of Canada.

===Atlantic Canada===

====Acadia====

The Parti acadien supported the creation of a new province consisting of the francophone parts of New Brunswick, in tandem with most Acadian Society of New Brunswick members. The party went into the 1978 election with a platform of independence. However, the idea died down after Richard Hatfield and the governing Progressive Conservatives promoted a platform that promised to increase the role of the Acadian people and culture within the province.

====Cape Breton Island====

In 1784 Cape Breton Island became a separate colony, but it was incorporated back into Nova Scotia in 1820. Provincehood was advocated by the Cape Breton Labour Party from 1982 to 1984.

====Labrador====

Labrador is the mainland portion of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Labrador Party has campaigned on the platform of a separate province. A similar campaign was held by locals in 2016 with a petition written to the MP on the federal level and the Labrador MHAs on the provincial level, based on claims that the provincial government has been inadequately funding for Labrador&#x27;s amenities such as roads, in contrast with Newfoundland; but largely benefited from its resources. Neither federal nor provincial representatives responded.

====Maritime Union====
The Maritime Union is a proposed province that would be formed by a merger of the three existing Maritime provinces of Canada: Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick. It would be the fifth-largest Canadian province by population. The Maritime Union has also been expanded to a proposed &quot;Atlantic Union,&quot; which would include Newfoundland and Labrador as well.

===Quebec===
====Mohawk territory/province====

Before the 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum, Mohawk leaders asserted a sovereign right to secede from Quebec if Quebec were to secede from Canada. In the CBC Television documentary &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau said that if the referendum had succeeded, he would have allowed the Mohawk communities to secede from Quebec on the grounds that they had never given up their sovereign rights.

====Montreal====
It has been proposed to separate the city of Montreal, its metropolitan area, or its non-francophone parts into a province separate from Quebec. There have been several proposals of that nature since the mid-20th century. Around the time of the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty, a self-named partition movement flourished advocating the separation of certain areas of Quebec, particularly the anglophone areas such as Montreal&#x27;s West Island, in the event of Quebec separation, and such areas would remain part of Canada. The movement is no longer active.

====Nunavik====

Nunavik is Quebec&#x27;s northernmost Inuit and First Nation territory, as well as northernmost territory overall, which seeks a status similar to Nunatsiavut in Labrador.

===Ontario===
====Northern Ontario====

There have been various movements proposing that the region of Northern Ontario secede from Ontario to form its own province. The first such movement emerged in Sudbury in the 1890s, when the provincial government began taxing mines. A second movement emerged after the creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905. In the 1940s, an organization, called the New Province League, was formed to lobby for the creation of a new territory of &quot;Aurora.&quot;

In 1966, a committee of mayors from the region, comprising Max Silverman of Sudbury, G. W. Maybury of Kapuskasing, Ernest Reid of Fort William, Leo Del Villano of Timmins, Merle Dickerson of North Bay, and Leo Foucault of Espanola, was formed to study the feasibility of Northern Ontario forming a new province. In 1999, the Northeastern Ontario Municipal Association, a committee consisting of the mayors of 14 Northern Ontario municipalities, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien asking him to outline the necessary conditions for the region to secede from Ontario to form a new province. The movement emerged as a reaction to the government of Mike Harris, whose Common Sense Revolution was widely unpopular in the region even though Harris was representing the Northern Ontario riding of Nipissing in the Ontario Legislature.

The Northern Ontario Heritage Party advocated the creation of a separate province by dividing from Southern Ontario in the 1970s although the party did not attract widespread electoral support. A newer group, the Northern Ontario Secession Movement, began a similar campaign in 2006 but did not attract the same degree of attention. The Northern Ontario Heritage Party was reregistered in 2010 with a platform that did not for full separation but instead supported a number of measures to increase the region&#x27;s power in the province. In 2016, the party began advocating for the full secession of Northern Ontario from the province, but it dropped separation from its platform again in 2018.

====Northwestern Ontario====

In 2006, some residents of Northwestern Ontario proposed that the region secede from Ontario to join Manitoba, due to the perception that the government of Ontario does not pay sufficient attention to the region&#x27;s issues. One paper in &quot;Canadian Public Policy&quot; suggested the region merge with Manitoba to form a new province called &quot;Mantario.&quot;

====Toronto====
Toronto is the largest city in Canada. Some have argued that the rest of Ontario benefits from Toronto more than the reverse. Some activists have lobbied for a separate province of Toronto. Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman was in office when he floated the idea because of what he perceived as the province&#x27;s excessive draining of tax resources from Toronto without providing sufficient support for public services within the city. In 2018, some activists revived the proposal again after Premier Doug Ford had introduced legislation to cut the number of seats on Toronto City Council from 47 to 25 seats months after the 2018 municipal election was already underway.

===Western Canada===
====Buffalo====
Buffalo was a proposed Canadian province prior to 1905. Carved out of the southern portion (south of 55°N) of the North-West Territories, it would have comprised the southern halves of the present-day provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, including the already-sizable urbanized communities of Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, and Regina, with Regina as the capital. Its main proponent was Sir Frederick Haultain, the Premier of the North-West Territories, who said in 1904, &quot;One big province would be able to do things no other province could.&quot; The proposal was not popular, especially in Calgary and Edmonton, both of which had their own ambitions to be a capital city (Edmonton eventually became the capital of Alberta). The proposal was rejected in 1905 by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who divided the region reaching 60°N with a north–south boundary as the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

====Vancouver Island====
The Colony of Vancouver Island was established in 1849, but was joined to the mainland Colony of British Columbia in 1866; when the united colony joined Canada in 1871, Vancouver Island remained part of the province of British Columbia. In 2013, in response to the federal electoral district redistribution, two separatist groups emerged to make Vancouver Island its own country or province. They hoped to move the British Columbia Legislature to a different city, make Vancouver Island its own province, and fly the flag of Vancouver Island by 2021. In the 2017 provincial election, the Vancouver Island Party proposed a referendum for Vancouver Island residents to vote on the issue. Vancouver Island has more people than three provinces and all three territories.

===Northern Canada===

Each of the three Canadian territories has movements lobbying for their territorial political status to be upgraded to full provincehood. Yukon Premier Tony Penikett fought the Meech Lake Accord in the 1980s on the grounds that provisions of the accord would have made it virtually impossible for the territory ever to become a province. In late 2004, Prime Minister Paul Martin surprised some observers by expressing his personal support for all three territories &quot;eventually&quot; gaining provincial status. He cited their importance to the country as a whole and the ongoing need to assert sovereignty in the Arctic, particularly since global warming could make that region more open to exploitation and lead to more complex international waters disputes.

===National Capital Region===

At various times, provincial, territorial or special federal status has been proposed for the metropolitan area consisting of Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec so that the National Capital Region would be a district like the Australian Capital Territory, Washington, D.C. (United States), or the National Capital Territory of Delhi (India).

==Movements outside Canada==
There have been movements to create new provinces and territories outside the borders of Canada.

===Movements inside British overseas territories===
In 1905, Ian Malcolm suggested in the British House of Commons that the United Kingdom might benefit from transferring one or more isles of the West Indies to Canada for national defence.

In 1919, Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden and his delegation to the Paris Peace Conference discussed transferring parts of the West Indies as territories, sub-dominions, or League of Nations mandates, including the possibility of exchanging some to the United States for the Alaska Panhandle.

====Current British overseas territories====
=====Bermuda=====
In 1949 Henry Vassey, then Chairman of the Bermuda Trade Development Board, urged the House of Assembly of Bermuda to pursue a political union with Canada. Four Methodist church congregations in Bermuda are part of the United Church of Canada, forming Bermuda Presbytery of the United Church&#x27;s Maritime Conference headquartered in Sackville, New Brunswick. The same Salvation Army Church territory serves both Canada and Bermuda with many of their pastors travelling between countries.

In January 2009, Nova Scotia Premier Rodney MacDonald and Bermuda Premier of Bermuda Ewart Brown signed a five-year agreement that would strengthen Nova Scotia&#x27;s ties with Bermuda and enhance service export opportunities, tourism, transportation, and health links in both jurisdictions.

Bermuda&#x27;s ties to Canada include the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda being overseen by Canada&#x27;s Chartered Professional Accounting profession.

=====Turks and Caicos Islands=====

The Turks and Caicos Islands are a British overseas territory in the West Indies. There is some support for a union with Canada, but the islands&#x27; small economy and Canada&#x27;s involvement in Haiti made that controversial. In 1917, Robert Borden first suggested for Canada to annex the islands. In 1974, Canadian New Democratic Party MP Max Saltsman introduced a failed attempt at consolidating the islands.

The idea was brought up again in 1986 by Progressive Conservative MP Dan McKenzie, but it was rejected by his party&#x27;s caucus committee on external affairs in 1987. The committee, chaired by David Daubney, looked at immigration, banking, health care, and tourism issues in making its decision.

In 2004, Conservative MP Peter Goldring visited Turks and Caicos to explore the possibility once more. He drafted a motion asking the Canadian government to look into the issue, but his party declined and cited immigration, tourism, and economic issues. However, the Canadian government did not dismiss the possibility of a future union. That year, the province of Nova Scotia voted to invite Turks and Caicos to join the province if the islands ever became part of Canada. That would bypass the problems with admitting Turks and Caicos as a separate province.

On 2 March 2009, the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; ran an article on its online site reporting the interest of the Canadian government to open a deep-water port in the Caribbean that would open up &quot;a new market for Canadian goods... in the Caribbean and nearby Central and South America.&quot; &quot;Suppose the port, unaffordable for Caribbean countries, boosted their standard of living and bolstered hemispheric security. Suppose the port doubled as a Canadian military operations base for countries wanting help to patrol their waters and to interdict the Caribbean&#x27;s robust trade in smuggled arms, drugs and people.&quot;

In May 2014, Turks and Caicos Premier Rufus Ewing visited the Canadian Parliament looking to improve its relationship with Canada, and was open to a possible &quot;marriage&quot; in the future.

In the Turks and Caicos Islands, support for a &quot;special relationship&quot; with Canada was at 90% in the 1990s, and in 2003, support for the relationship stood at around 60%. Goldring has championed the cause of integrating the Turks and Caicos Islands as a Canadian territory for security benefits as well as increasing Canada&#x27;s influence in Central and Southern America with regard to counterterrorism and trade and combating encroaching Chinese influence in several small Caribbean islands, such as St. Lucia.

====Former British overseas territories====

Former British territories have expressed interest in joining Canada.

=====The Bahamas=====
In 1911, at the request of the Bahamian House of Assembly, the Canadian and the Bahamian governments began serious negotiations for Bahamian accession to the Canadian Confederation. However, a racial panic ignited by the migration of over 1000 African-Americans fleeing violence in Oklahoma derailed the discussions. Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier turned against the idea and cited incompatible &quot;ethnical origin.&quot; After Laurier lost the September 1911 federal election, Bahamian Governor William Grey-Wilson travelled to Canada to reopen accession talks with the newly elected Prime Minister Robert Borden. In a meeting between Grey and Borden on 18 October 1911, Borden rejected the possibility of taking the Bahamas into the Canadian Confederation. His reasoning was that the events of the past year had proved that Canadian public opinion would not countenance the admission of a majority-black province. The British Colonial Office concurred: &quot;No doubt for the moment the Dominion government would safeguard their interests, but there are signs of the rise of a colour question in Canada and in any case it cannot be long before U.S. opinion gives the tone to Canada in regard the Negro.&quot;

=====Barbados=====
In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to Sir Francis Hincks requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of Canada were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions and whether the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by Britain.

In 1952, the &quot;Barbados Advocate&quot; newspaper covered the idea and even polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the Barbados House of Assembly, and later, as first President of the Senate, Sir Theodore Brancker; however, they were moreso in favor of the immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British Caribbean (a proposal that would later materialize as the West Indian Federation) with complete dominion status within five years.

In 2008, the former President of the Barbados International Business Association (BIBA) reflected on the close historical relations between both nations and questioned whether a political union was possible within the next 100 years.

=====Jamaica=====
In the political crisis that hit Jamaica in 1882, one of the proposed solutions was joining Canada. Michael Solomon led the pro-Confederation faction, but when he introduced a motion to that effect in the Legislative Council everyone but he voted against it.

=====The West Indies Federation=====
In a 1952 letter by T. G. Major, a Canadian Trade Commissioner in Trinidad and Tobago, it was stated to the Under Secretary of State for External Affairs that the respective leaders of the British Caribbean could not reach a clear consensus for the exact style of a federal union. During a parliamentary conference held in Ottawa, it was also noted though that the colony of British Honduras (now Belize, which held observer status in the West Indies Federation) showed more interest in a union with Canada than with the other British Caribbean colonies.

===Movements inside the United States===
====Maine====
Some propose for Maine to secede from the United States and join Canada as a province. Maine was briefly held by British forces and part of British North America during the War of 1812. It was returned to the United States by the Treaty of Ghent.

====Minnesota====
In the late 2010s, the petitions and discussions have launched what people are calling &quot;Minnexit&quot;. Although no political party has floated the notion of secession, there is a long-standing history of reconnecting at least part of Minnesota with Canada through Manitoba&#x27;s southeast attachment, the Northwest Angle.

=====Northwest Angle=====
The Northwest Angle is a part of Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota that is accessible by road to the rest of the United States only through Manitoba (excluding winter ice roads). Due to laws restricting fishing rights in the Lake of the Woods, some residents suggested leaving the United States and joining Canada in 1997. The following year, Representative Collin Peterson proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow the residents of the Northwest Angle, which is part of his district, to vote on seceding from the United States and joining Canada. Peterson&#x27;s proposal angered the leaders of Red Lake Indian Reservation, which holds most of the Northwest Angle&#x27;s land. Whether this change would also include Elm Point, a small cape to the south of the angle but also cut off from the United States, is not determined.

====Vermont====
Some supporters of the Vermont independence movement propose for Vermont to join Canada as a province.

==== Washington ====

=====Point Roberts=====
Point Roberts is a peninsula, attached by land to the city of Delta, British Columbia, but surrounded entirely by water otherwise; residents of Point Roberts must travel through Canada, or by water or air, to reach any other part of Washington state. In 1949, there was talk about Point Roberts seceding from the U.S. and joining Canada, but this never happened. The idea has been periodically revived, most recently in 2020 after the community was heavily impacted by the closure of the Canada-U.S. border during the COVID-19 pandemic, but has still not been actively pursued.

===Movements inside European outer regions===
====Saint Pierre and Miquelon====
In the past, a few politicians in Saint Pierre and Miquelon have proposed that the islands pursue secession from France to become part of Canada either as part of Quebec or as a new territory so that the islands, whose economy is highly dependent on the Atlantic fishery, could participate in Canada&#x27;s much larger maritime fishing zone, rather than France&#x27;s limited &quot;keyhole&quot; zone.
In April 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the president of St. Pierre and Miquelon&#x27;s territorial council, Bernard Briand, proposed that the islands join the &quot;Atlantic Bubble&quot;.

===Movements inside Europe===
====Iceland====
During the Icelandic financial crisis of the early 2010s, a small group of Icelanders launched &quot;Invite Iceland In,&quot; a campaign to get Iceland admitted to Confederation as Canada&#x27;s 11th province. The campaign did not attract widespread political support and is now dormant. A smaller-scale proposal for Iceland to adopt the Canadian dollar as its new official currency to replace the Icelandic króna received much more attention, including attracting comment from Icelandic Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, but it also failed to get adopted.

====Scotland====
There were renewed calls for a second independence referendum from pro-independence parties such as the Scottish National Party after the U.K. voted to leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum despite Scotland voting to remain in the European Union. The author Ken McGoogan stated that Scotland should join Canada as its eleventh province and argued that Scotland would be treated better under Canadian rule. However, there is little support for that from either the Scottish public or Scotland&#x27;s main political parties.

<text>Harold Douglas (born Harold Cone; September 1, 1924 – March 7, 2014) was an American voice actor best known for performing thousands of voice-overs for movie trailers, television commercials, and stage plays over the course of a six-decade career.

==Early life==
Harold &quot;Hal&quot; Douglas was born Harold Cone in Stamford, Connecticut, on September 1, 1924, the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, Samuel and Miriam Levenson Cone. Douglas and his brother Edwin were primarily raised by their grandparents Sarah and Tevya Levenson after their mother died when Douglas was only nine. He served in World War II, and attended the University of Miami in Florida as a drama major.

==Career==
Douglas began a career in radio in the 1950s. By the 1960s, he had become a producer for several prominent advertising agencies in New York City. He finally moved into doing voice-overs for commercials, promos, and trailers by the early 1970s, and would continue doing so until his retirement in 2010.

Because many of his trailers have begun with the words &quot;In a world&quot;, there is controversy over whether his voice has immortalized them. (Don LaFontaine claimed to have actually created the catchphrase.) In addition, Douglas has been the promotional voice for The WB, ABC, A&amp;E, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Halloween Treat&quot;, &quot;A Disney Halloween&quot;, Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Vault Disney&quot; (1997–2002), and The History Channel.

He did the voiceover narration for the 1997 Detroit Red Wings, the 1994 and 1995 Houston Rockets and the 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1997 Chicago Bulls championship documentaries. He also did voiceover narrations of other NBA documentaries of the 1990s. 

Because he recorded so many trailers through the years, he was sometimes mistaken for Don LaFontaine. He can be seen parodying himself in the trailer for &quot;Comedian&quot;, a documentary that features Jerry Seinfeld.

Douglas provided narration for the trailer for the novel &quot;All the Talk Is Dead&quot; by Michael Ebner.

Unlike most movie trailer announcers, Douglas lived in Northern Virginia and his agent was based in New York City instead of Los Angeles. Hal Douglas was described by a Miramax publicist as &quot;perhaps the most recognizable trailer voice in the business&quot;.

Douglas&#x27;s voice briefly appears in the skit &quot;5 Men and a Limo&quot;, featuring other notable voiceover recording artists, such as Don LaFontaine, John Leader, Nick Tate, Al Chalk, and Mark Elliot. As the skit was filmed in California, and as Douglas was primarily based in the East Coast, he was unable to make a physical appearance, and only is heard in a brief recording.

==Personal life and death==
Douglas married Lois Barrett. They had two sons. He later married Ruth Francis around 1971. They had one daughter.

In 1988 Douglas moved from Pawling, New York, to a 40-acre farm in Lovettsville, Virginia, where he pursued organic gardening and his wife took up competitive horse riding. He had a small recording studio built there that allowed him to do his work at home, sometimes in pajamas. Douglas died at his home on March 7, 2014, of pancreatic cancer, at the age of 89.

<text>In computer security, a key server is a computer that receives and then serves existing cryptographic keys to users or other programs. The users&#x27; programs can be running on the same network as the key server or on another networked computer.

The keys distributed by the key server are almost always provided as part of a cryptographically protected public key certificates containing not only the key but also &#x27;entity&#x27; information about the owner of the key. The certificate is usually in a standard format, such as the OpenPGP public key format, the X.509 certificate format, or the PKCS format. Further, the key is almost always a public key for use with an asymmetric key encryption algorithm.

==History==
Key servers play an important role in public key cryptography.
In public key cryptography an individual is able to generate a key pair, where one of the keys is kept private
while the other is distributed publicly. Knowledge of the public key does not compromise the security of public key cryptography. An
individual holding the public key of a key pair can use that key to carry out cryptographic operations that allow secret communications with strong authentication of the holder of the matching private key. The
need to have the public key of a key pair in order to start
communication or verify signatures is a bootstrapping problem. Locating keys
on the web or writing to the individual asking them to transmit their public
keys can be time consuming and unsecure. Key servers act as central repositories to
alleviate the need to individually transmit public keys and can act as the root of a chain of trust.

The first web-based PGP keyserver was written for a thesis by Marc Horowitz, while he was studying at MIT. Horowitz&#x27;s keyserver was called the HKP Keyserver
after a web-based OpenPGP HTTP Keyserver Protocol (HKP), used to allow people to interact with the
keyserver. Users were able to upload, download, and search keys either through
HKP on TCP port 11371, or through web pages which ran CGI
scripts. Before the creation of the HKP Keyserver, keyservers relied on email
processing scripts for interaction.

=== Enterprise PGP ===

A separate key server, known as the PGP Certificate Server, was developed by PGP, Inc. and was used as the software (through version 2.5.x for the server) for the default key server in PGP through version 8.x (for the client software), keyserver.pgp.com. Network Associates was granted a patent co-authored by Jon Callas (United States Patent 6336186) on the key server concept.

To replace the aging Certificate Server, an LDAP-based key server was redesigned at Network Associates in part by Randy Harmon and Len Sassaman, called PGP Keyserver 7. With the release of PGP 6.0, LDAP was the preferred key server interface for Network Associates’ PGP versions. This LDAP and LDAPS key server (which also spoke HKP for backwards compatibility, though the protocol was (arguably correctly) referred to as “HTTP” or “HTTPS”) also formed the basis for the PGP Administration tools for private key servers in corporate settings, along with a schema for Netscape Directory Server.

PGP Keyserver 7 was later replaced by the new PGP Corporation PGP Global Directory of 2011 which allows PGP keys to be published and downloaded using HTTPS or LDAP.

=== OpenPGP ===
The OpenPGP world largely used its own development of keyserver software independent from the PGP Corporation suite. The main software used until the 2019 spamming attack was &quot;SKS&quot; (Synchronizing Key Server), written by Yaron Minsky. The public SKS pool (consisting of many interconnected SKS instances) provided access via HKPS (HKP with TLS) and HTTPS. It finally shut down in 2021 following a number of GDPR that it was unable to process effectively.

A number of newer pools using other software has been made available following the shutdown of the SKS pool, see .

==Public versus private keyservers==

Many publicly accessible key servers, located around the world, are computers which store and provide OpenPGP keys over the Internet for users of that cryptosystem. In this instance, the computers can be, and mostly are, run by individuals as a pro bono service, facilitating the web of trust model PGP uses.

Several publicly accessible S/MIME key servers are available to publish or retrieve certificates used with the S/MIME cryptosystem.

There are also multiple proprietary public key infrastructure systems which maintain key servers for their users; those may be private or public, and only the participating users are likely to be aware of those keyservers at all.

== Problems with keyservers ==

=== Lack of retraction mechanism ===

The OpenPGP keyservers since their development in 1990s suffered from a few problems. Once a public key has been uploaded, it was purposefully made difficult to remove it as servers auto-synchronize between each other (it was done in order to fight government censorship). Some users stop using their public keys for various reasons, such as when they forget their pass phrase, or if their private key is compromised or lost. In those cases, it was hard to delete a public key from the server, and even if it were deleted, someone else can upload a fresh copy of the same public key to the server. This leads to an accumulation of old fossil public keys that never go away, a form of &quot;keyserver plaque&quot;.

The lack of a retraction mechanism also breached the European General Data Protection Regulation, which was cited as a reason for the closure of the SKS pool. Modern PGP keyservers allow deletion of keys. Because only the owner of a key&#x27;s e-mail address can upload a key (see next section) in such servers, the key stays deleted unless the owner decides otherwise.

=== Lack of ownership check ===
The keyserver also had no way to check to see if the key was legitimate (belong to true owner). As consequence anyone can upload a bogus public key to the keyserver, bearing the name of a person who in fact does not own that key, or even worse, use it as vulnerability: the Certificate Spamming Attack.

Modern keyservers, starting with the PGP Global Directory, now use the e-mail address for confirmation. This keyserver sent an email confirmation request to the putative key owner, asking that person to confirm that the key in question is theirs. If they confirm it, the PGP Global Directory accepts the key. The confirmation can be renewed periodically, to prevent the accumulation of keyserver plaque. The result is a higher quality collection of public keys, and each key has been vetted by email with the key&#x27;s apparent owner. But as consequence, another problem arise: because PGP Global Directory allows key account maintenance and verifies only by email, not cryptographically, anybody having access to the email account could for example delete a key and upload a bogus one.

The last Internet Engineering Task Force draft for HKP also defines a distributed key server network, based on DNS SRV records: to find the key of &quot;someone@example.com&quot;, one can ask it by requesting &quot;example.com&quot;&#x27;s key server.

=== Leakage of personal relationships ===

For many individuals, the purpose of using cryptography is to obtain a higher
level of privacy in personal interactions and relationships. It has been pointed
out that allowing a public key to be uploaded in a key server when using
decentralized web of trust based cryptographic systems, like PGP, may reveal a
good deal of information that an individual may wish to have kept private. Since
PGP relies on signatures on an individual&#x27;s public key to determine the
authenticity of that key, potential relationships can be revealed by analyzing
the signers of a given key. In this way, models of entire social networks can be
developed. (Mike Perry&#x27;s 2013 criticism of the Web of Trust mentions the issue
as already been &quot;discussed at length&quot;.)

A number of modern key servers remove third-party signatures from the uploaded
key. Doing so removes all personal connections into the Web of Trust, thus preventing
any leakage from happening. The main goal, however, was to minimize the storage space
required, as &quot;signature spamming&quot; can easily add megabytes to a key.

<text>Patrick John Nuttgens (2 March 1930 – 15 March 2004) was an influential English architect and academic.

== Early life ==
Nuttgens was born in Whiteleaf, Buckinghamshire, the fourth of five children to Kathleen Mary () an Irish woman and accomplished mathematician, and stained-glass artist Jozef Edward Nuttgens who was born in Aachen, Germany. His mother died when he was seven years old during his first term at Grace Dieu Manor School, near Leicester. His father subsequently remarried and had eight more children - one of whom was the stained glass designer Joseph Ambrose Nuttgens. As a noted stained glass designer, Joseph took his family to live next to Eric Gill and his friends at Piggotts, Speen, Buckinghamshire.

Nuttgens was brought up Roman Catholic, attending Ratcliffe College, run by Rosminian Fathers where he contracted poliomyelitis at the age of 12 and was hospitalised for two years, finally leaving hospital in 1944. Nuttgens later studied architecture and painting at Edinburgh College of Art and the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1953 and completing his PhD in 1959. He was elected to ARIBA in 1956. While he was at the University of Edinburgh he met Bridget Badenoch (known as &#x27;Biddy&#x27;), an English literature student, whom he married in 1954. The couple had nine children, including Susie Hargreaves, the composer Sandy Nuttgens and the Green Party politician and broadcaster Peg Alexander.

==Career==
Robert Matthew appointed Nuttgens as the chief administrator, lecturer and assistant at the newly founded architecture department at the University of Edinburgh. In 1962, Nuttgens became director of the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies at the University of York, and later professor of architecture (1968). In 1969, he was appointed first director of Leeds Polytechnic (later Leeds Metropolitan University, now Leeds Beckett University). He was Hoffman Wood Professor of Architecture at the University of Leeds from 1968 to 1970 and again from 1984 to 1985.

Nuttgens was awarded honorary doctorates by several universities including Heriot-Watt in 1990 and was appointed CBE in 1983. His books include &quot;The Story of Architecture&quot;, &quot;The Art of Learning: a Personal Journey&quot;, &quot;The Home Front: Housing the People (1840–1990),&quot; &quot;York... the Continuing City&quot; (illustrated by John Shannon), &quot;Leeds: The Back to Front, Inside-out, Upside-down City&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Mitchell Beazley Pocket Guide to Architecture&quot;. Nuttgens also had a regular columns in The Times Higher Educational Supplement. 

Patrick Nuttgens was the first disabled person in a wheelchair to write and present a factual series on BBC Television, &#x27;The Home Front&#x27; BBC2 1989

===Membership of NCRG===
Nuttgens was a member of The New Churches Research Group (NCRG), a group of Catholic and Anglican church architects and craftspeople who promoted liturgical reform of churches though publications such as The Tablet and Architects&#x27; Journal. The group was co-founded by Peter Hammond and included architects Peter Gilbey, Robert Maguire, Keith Murray (an ecclesiastical designer), John Newton (Burles, Newton &amp; Partners), George Pace, Patrick Reyntiens (stained glass artist), Austin Winkley, Lance Wright, as well as Catholic priest and theologian Charles Davis.

==Later years and death==
In 1981 he wrote a television documentary on Edwin Lutyens. But from 1985 became a wheelchair user as his health worsened. He resigned in 1986 from his academic post after he was (mistakenly) diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Later, it was discovered he was suffering from post-polio syndrome. He began a career writing, broadcasting, painting and travelling. In 1989, for example, he wrote and introduced a television history of British housing, &quot;The Home Front&quot;. He also appeared on radio where he was a regular participant in &quot;A Word in Edgeways&quot; and &quot;Round Britain Quiz&quot;. He sat on a great number of committees, including the Royal Fine Art Commission (1983–90) and the York Theatre Royal Board (1990–96). He also chaired the BBC’s northern advisory council and its committee on continuing education. He was awarded honorary doctorates by a number of universities and in 1983 he was awarded a CBE.

Nuttgens lived in Terrington and died in York hospital on 15 March 2004 from post-polio syndrome. The University of York and the York Georgian Society offer an annual award named in his honour, first offered in 2008. The award provides a grant for two PhD students to research any aspect of the Georgian period. The first prize was awarded to Katie Crowther from the Department of English and Related Literature for her paper &#x27;Georgian Paper Traces: Women’s Stories, Ephemeral Texts and Hidden Objects&#x27;.

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-52 () is a Soviet primary trainer aircraft which first flew in 1976. It was produced in Romania from 1977 to 1998 by Aerostar, as &quot;Iak-52&quot;, which gained manufacturing rights under agreement within the former COMECON socialist trade organisation. The Yak-52 was designed as an aerobatic trainer for students in the Soviet DOSAAF training organisation, which trained civilian sport pilots and military pilots. Currently the Yak-52 is used in the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) World Aerobatic Yak 52 Competition, a popular powered aircraft one-design World Aerobatic Championship.

==Design and development==
A descendant of the single-seat competition aerobatic Yakovlev Yak-50, the all-metal Yak-52 is powered by a 268 kW (360 hp) Vedeneyev M14P nine-cylinder radial engine.

Since the aircraft was designed to serve as a military trainer, the development of the aircraft incorporates a number of features to be found on the early postwar fighters: notably the cockpit tandem layout (instrument panel, seat design, cockpit opening system), tail design, tricycle landing gear, fuselage mixed construction (monocoque with steel tube construction), inner flaps, controls position, access panels on sides of the fuselage, even the location of the radio antenna and overall dimensions of the airplane, which extensively match the Yakovlev Yak-17 UTI jet fighter trainer (NATO code name Magnet).

The aircraft has fuel and oil systems permitting inverted flight for as long as two minutes. The engine drives a two-bladed counter-clockwise rotating, variable pitch, wood and fiberglass laminate propeller.

At 998 kg (2,200 lb) empty weight, the Yak-52 is responsive and very capable as an aerobatic aircraft. Yet it is also easy to fly and land. It has been used in international aerobatic competition up to the Advanced level. It is stressed to +7 and –5 Gs, rolls (to the right) at well more than 180 degrees/second (measured up to 352 degrees/second to the right), and is capable of every manoeuvre in the Aresti catalog.

The Yak-52, like most Soviet military aircraft, was designed to operate in rugged environments with minimal maintenance. One of its key features, unusual in western aircraft, is its extensive pneumatic system. Engine starting, landing gear, flaps, and wheel brakes are all pneumatically actuated. Spherical storage bottles for air, replenished by an engine driven compressor, are situated behind the rear cockpit and contents displayed on the instrument panels. The operating pressure is between 10 and 50 bars (145 and 725 psi) and an emergency circuit is reserved for lowering the undercarriage if the normal supply is exhausted or the compressor fails. Additionally both main and reserve bottles can be charged from a port on the ground with compressed air, usually from a scuba type air bottle. The ground steering/braking arrangement, especially, takes some adjustment for flyers accustomed to hydraulics, because the aircraft uses differential braking controlled by rudder pedals and a hand-operated lever on the control stick.

The tricycle landing gear is retractable, but it remains partially exposed in the retracted position, affording both a useful level of drag in down manoeuvres and a measure of protection should the aircraft be forced to land &quot;wheels up.&quot;

A number of &quot;westernised&quot; versions of the Yak-52 are now produced. The replacement of the existing Soviet avionics, fitting of a three-blade propeller and the M14PF 298 kW (400 hp) upgrade to the usual 360 hp M14P engine, and conversion to conventional &quot;tail-dragger&quot; landing gear (Yak-52TD) are some of the modifications made to the standard aircraft. There is also a factory-produced Yak-52TW tail-dragger version by Aerostar. The TW has an extra 120 L (32 US gal) of fuel capacity in two extra wing tanks, the M14PF engine designated &amp; three blade propeller, an electric start, and modern instruments.

On April 16, 2004, a modernised variant Yak-52M was flown in Russia. It is fitted with modernised M-14Kh engine, three-blade propeller, and other modifications.

Despite being unarmed, a Yak-52 was used by Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine to shoot down a Russian Orlan-10 reconnaissance drone over Odessa in April 2024, and to shoot down a ZALA drone on 8 June 2024. Images posted on social media suggest that at least one Yak-52 has downed up to eight drones. The Yak-52&#x27;s low stall speed allows the plane to pursue drones and carry out maneuvers at slower speeds, enabling a machine gunner in the plane&#x27;s rear seat to engage drones at close range.

== Operational history ==

=== Ukraine ===
While the Yak-52 was never intended to serve as an air-to-air combat platform, improvisation during the Russo-Ukrainian war has led to the platform attaining kills against UAVs.

On April 27, 2024, over Odesa, Ukraine, footage emerged from the perspective of a Russian drone showing a Yak-52 being flown by Ukrainian pilots with the canopy open. The first crew member, the pilot, flew circles around the drone as the second crew member attacked the drone with a shotgun. Through this method, a Yak-52 has reportedly attained 6 kills against Orlan 10/30 series drones and 2 against Zala 421-16E drones. Two more kills are attributed to lightning striking one UAV in front of the Ukrainian pilots, and another to a drone encountering a birdstrike.

<text>The Nassau Agreement, concluded on 21 December 1962, was an agreement negotiated between President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, and Harold Macmillan, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to end the Skybolt Crisis. A series of meetings between the two leaders over three days in the Bahamas followed Kennedy&#x27;s announcement of his intention to cancel the Skybolt air-launched ballistic missile project. The US agreed to supply the UK with Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missiles for the UK Polaris programme.

Under an earlier agreement, the US had agreed to supply Skybolt missiles in return for allowing the establishment of a ballistic missile submarine base in the Holy Loch near Glasgow. The British Government had then cancelled the development of its medium-range ballistic missile, known as Blue Streak, leaving Skybolt as the basis of the UK&#x27;s independent nuclear deterrent in the 1960s. Without Skybolt, the V-bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) were likely to have become obsolete through being unable to penetrate the improved air defences that the Soviet Union was expected to deploy by the 1970s.

At Nassau, Macmillan rejected Kennedy&#x27;s other offers, and pressed him to supply the UK with Polaris missiles. These represented more advanced technology than Skybolt, and the US was not inclined to provide them except as part of a Multilateral Force within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Under the Nassau Agreement the US agreed to provide the UK with Polaris. The agreement stipulated that the UK&#x27;s Polaris missiles would be assigned to NATO as part of a Multilateral Force, and could be used independently only when &quot;supreme national interests&quot; intervened.

The Nassau Agreement became the basis of the Polaris Sales Agreement, a treaty which was signed on 6 April 1963. Under this agreement, British nuclear warheads were fitted to Polaris missiles. As a result, responsibility for Britain&#x27;s nuclear deterrent passed from the RAF to the Royal Navy. The President of France, Charles de Gaulle, cited Britain&#x27;s dependence on the United States under the Nassau Agreement as one of the main reasons for his veto of Britain&#x27;s application for admission to the European Economic Community (EEC) on 14 January 1963.

==Background==
===British nuclear deterrent===
During the early part of the Second World War, Britain had a nuclear weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys. At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project to create a combined British, American and Canadian project. The British Government trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it regarded as a joint discovery, after the war, but the United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) ended technical cooperation.

Fearing a resurgence of United States isolationism, and Britain losing its great power status, the British Government restarted its own development effort, now codenamed High Explosive Research. The first British atomic bomb was tested in Operation Hurricane on 3 October 1952. The subsequent British development of the hydrogen bomb, and a favourable international relations climate created by the Sputnik Crisis, led to the McMahon Act being amended in 1958, resulting in the restoration of the nuclear Special Relationship in the form of the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, which allowed Britain to acquire nuclear weapons systems from the United States.
Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons armament was initially based on free-fall bombs delivered by the V-bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF). With the development of the hydrogen bomb, a nuclear strike on the UK could kill most of the population and disrupt or destroy the political and military chains of command. The UK therefore adopted a counterforce strategy, targeting the airbases from which bombers could launch attacks on the UK, and knocking them out before they could do so.

The possibility of the manned bomber becoming obsolete by the late 1960s in the face of improved air defences was foreseen. One solution was the development of long-range missiles. In 1953, the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff (Operational Requirements), Air Vice-Marshal Geoffrey Tuttle, requested a specification for a ballistic missile with range, and work commenced at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough later that year. In April 1955, the Commander-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command, Air Chief Marshal Sir George Mills expressed his dissatisfaction with the counterforce strategy, and argued for a countervalue one that targeted administration and population centres for their deterrent effect.

At a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) meeting in Paris in December 1953, United States Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, raised the possibility of a joint medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) development programme. Talks were held in June 1954, resulting in the signing of an agreement on 12 August 1954. The United Kingdom with United States support would develop an MRBM, which was called Blue Streak. It was initially estimated to cost £70 million (equivalent to £ in ), with the United States paying 15 per cent. By 1958, the project was in trouble. Its deployment was still years away, but the United States was supplying American-built Thor intermediate-range ballistic missiles under Project Emily, and there were concerns about liquid fuelled Blue Streak&#x27;s vulnerability to a pre-emptive nuclear strike.

To extend the effectiveness and operational life of the V-bombers, an Operational Requirement (OR.1132), was issued on 3 September 1954 for an air-launched, rocket-propelled standoff missile with a range of that could be launched from a V-bomber. This became Blue Steel. The Ministry of Supply placed a development contract with Avro in March 1956, and it entered service in December 1962. By this time it was anticipated that even with Blue Steel, the air defences of the Soviet Union would soon improve to the extent that V-bombers might find it difficult to attack their targets, and there were calls for the development of the Blue Steel Mark II with a range of at least . Despite the name, this was a whole new missile, and not a development of Mark I. The Minister of Aviation, Duncan Sandys, insisted that priority be accorded to getting the Mark I into service, and the Mark II was cancelled at the end of 1959.

===Skybolt===

Confronted with the same problem, the United States Air Force (USAF) also attempted to extend the operational life of its strategic bombers by developing a stand off missile, the AGM-28 Hound Dog. The first production model was delivered to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in December 1959. It carried a W28 warhead, and had a range of at high level and at low level. Its circular error probable (CEP) of over at full range was considered acceptable for a warhead of this size. A Boeing B-52 Stratofortress could carry two, but the underslung Pratt &amp; Whitney J52 engine precluded its carriage by bombers with less underwing clearance like the Convair B-58 Hustler and the North American XB-70 Valkyrie. It entered service in large numbers, with 593 in service by 1963. Numbers declined thereafter to 308 in 1976, but it remained in service until 1977, when it was replaced by the AGM-69 SRAM. Despite its being superior in performance to Blue Steel, the British showed little interest in Hound Dog. It could not be carried by the Handley Page Victor, and there were doubts as to whether even the Avro Vulcan had sufficient ground clearance.

Even as Hound Dog was entering service, the USAF was contemplating a successor. An Advanced Air to Surface Missile (AASM) that could carry a warhead with a range of and a CEP of . Such a missile would make manned bombers competitive with Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). However, it would also require significant technological advances. The missile became the AGM-48 Skybolt. As costs rose and support diminished, the USAF decreased its specifications to carrying a warhead and a CEP of . This was estimated to cost $893.6 million (equivalent to $ in ). A May 1960 report to the chairman of the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), George Kistiakowsky, the PSAC Missile Advisory Panel stated that it was unconvinced of the Skybolt&#x27;s merits, as the new LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM would be able to perform the same missions at much lower cost. PSAC therefore recommended in December 1960 that Skybolt be cancelled forthwith. United States Secretary of Defense Thomas S. Gates, Jr., elected not to request further funding for it, but avoided cancellation by reprogramming $70 million (equivalent to $ in )from the previous year&#x27;s allocation.

A crucial reason for Skybolt&#x27;s survival was the support it garnered from Britain. Blue Streak was cancelled on 24 February 1960, subject to an adequate replacement being procured from the US. An initial solution appeared to be Skybolt, which combined the range of Blue Streak with the mobile basing of the Blue Steel, and was small enough that two could be carried on the Vulcan bomber. Armed with a British Red Snow warhead, this would improve the capability of the UK&#x27;s V-bomber force, and extend its useful life into the late 1960s and early 1970s. Like the USAF, the RAF was concerned that ballistic missiles could eventually replace manned bombers.
An institutional challenge came from the United States Navy, which was developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), the UGM-27 Polaris. The US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, kept the First Sea Lord, Lord Mountbatten, apprised of its development. By moving the deterrent out to sea, Polaris offered the prospect of a deterrent that was invulnerable to a first strike, and thereby reduced the risk of a first strike on the British Isles, which would no longer be effective. It also had greater value as a deterrent, because retaliation could not be avoided. It would also restore the Royal Navy to its traditional role as the nation&#x27;s first line of defence, although not everyone in the navy was on board with that idea. The British Nuclear Deterrent Study Group (BNDSG) produced a study that argued that SLBM technology was as yet unproven, that Polaris would be expensive, and that given the time it would take to build the boats, it could not be deployed before the early 1970s. The Cabinet Defence Committee approved the acquisition of Skybolt in February 1960.

The Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, met with President Dwight Eisenhower at Camp David near Washington in March 1960, and secured permission to buy Skybolt without strings attached. In return, the Americans were given permission to base the US Navy&#x27;s Polaris-equipped ballistic missile submarines at the Holy Loch in Scotland. The financial arrangement was particularly favourable to Britain, as the US was charging only the unit cost of Skybolt, absorbing all the research and development costs. Mountbatten was disappointed, as was Burke, who now had to face the possible survival of Skybolt at the Pentagon. Exactly what was agreed with regard to Polaris was not clear; the Americans wanted any later offer of Polaris to be as part of a scheme for deployment of NATO MRBMs known as the Multilateral Force. With the Skybolt agreement in hand, the Minister of Defence, Harold Watkinson, announced the cancellation of Blue Streak to the House of Commons on 13 April 1960.

===American concerns===
Skybolt proponents in the USAF hoped that the incoming Kennedy administration, which took office in January 1961, would be supportive of Skybolt, given its election campaigning on the basis of an alleged missile gap between Soviet and US capabilities. Initially it was; Robert McNamara the new Secretary of Defense, defended Skybolt before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He requested $347 million to purchase 92 Skybolt missiles in 1963, with the intention of deploying 1,150 missiles by 1967. However, on 21 October 1961 the USAF raised its estimate of research and development costs to $492.6 million (equivalent to $ in ), an increase of over $100 million (equivalent to $ in ), and production costs were now reckoned at $1.27 billion (equivalent to $ in ), an increase of $591 million (equivalent to $ in ).
The Kennedy Administration adopted a policy of opposition to independent British nuclear forces in April 1961. In a speech at Ann Arbor, Michigan, on 16 June 1962, McNamara stated &quot;limited nuclear capabilities, operating independently, are dangerous, expensive, prone to obsolescence and lacking in credibility as a deterrent,&quot; and that &quot;relatively weak national nuclear forces with enemy cities as their targets are not likely to perform even the function of deterrence.&quot; The former United States Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, was even more blunt; in a speech at West Point he stated: &quot;Britain&#x27;s attempt to play a separate power role – that is, a role apart from Europe, a role based on a &#x27;special relationship&#x27; with the United States, a role based on being the head of a Commonwealth which has no political structure or unity or strength and enjoys a fragile and precarious economic relationship – this role is about played out.&quot;

The Kennedy administration was concerned that a situation like the Suez Crisis might repeat itself, one that would once again incite a nuclear threat against the UK from the Soviet Union. The Americans developed a plan to force the UK into the Multilateral Force concept, a dual key arrangement that would allow launch only if both parties agreed. If nuclear weapons were part of a multinational force, attacking them would require attacks on the other hosting countries as well. The US feared that otherwise other countries would want to follow the UK lead and develop their own deterrent forces, leading to a nuclear proliferation problem even among their own allies. If a deterrent was provided by an international force, the need for individual forces would be reduced.

Between 1955 and 1960, the British economy had lagged behind that of the rest of Europe, growing at an average of 2.5 per cent per annum, compared with France&#x27;s growth of 4.8 per cent, Germany&#x27;s of 6.4 per cent, and the European Economic Community (EEC) average of 5.3 per cent, and Macmillan devoted much of 1960 to laying the ground for Britain&#x27;s entry into the EEC. The US was concerned that providing Polaris to Britain would jeopardise Britain&#x27;s prospects of joining the EEC. Long-term US policy was to persuade the UK to build up its conventional military forces, and to secure admission to the EEC.

McNamara introduced cost-effectiveness analysis to defence procurement. Skybolt suffered from rising costs, and the first five test launches were failures. This was not unusual; Polaris and Minuteman had similar problems. What doomed Skybolt was an inability to demonstrate capability beyond that achievable by Hound Dog, Minuteman or Polaris. This meant that there were few advantages for the United States in continuing Skybolt, but at the same time its cancellation would be a powerful political tool for bringing the UK into their Multilateral Force. The British, on the other hand, had cancelled all other projects to concentrate fully on Skybolt. When warned not to put all their eggs in the one basket, the British replied that there was &quot;no other egg, and no other basket&quot;. On 7 November 1962, McNamara met with Kennedy, and recommended that Skybolt be cancelled. He then briefed the British Ambassador to the United States, David Ormsby-Gore. Kennedy agreed to cancel Skybolt on 23 November 1962.

==Negotiations==
McNamara met with Solly Zuckerman, the UK Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence on 9 December,
 and flew to London to meet with the Minister of Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, on 11 December. On arrival he told the media that Skybolt was an expensive and complex program that had suffered five test failures. Kennedy told a television interviewer that &quot;we don&#x27;t think that we are going to get $2.5 billion worth of national security&quot;. US National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy gave an interview on television in which he stated that the US had no obligation to supply Skybolt to the UK. Thorneycroft had expected McNamara to offer Polaris instead, but found him unwilling to countenance such an offer except as part of a Multinational Force. McNamara was willing to supply Hound Dog, or to allow the British to continue development of Skybolt.

These discussions were reported to the House of Commons by Thorneycroft, leading to a storm of protest. Air Commodore Sir Arthur Vere Harvey pointed out that while Skybolt had suffered five test failures, Polaris had thirteen failures in its development. He went on to state &quot;that some of us on this side, who want to see Britain retain a nuclear deterrent, are highly suspicious of some of the American motives... and say that the British people are tired of being pushed around&quot;. Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond asked: &quot;Does not this mark the absolute failure of the policy of the independent deterrent? Is it not the case that everybody else in the world knew this, except the Conservative Party in this country? Is it not the case that the Americans gave up production of the B-52, which was to carry Skybolt, nine months ago?&quot;

As the Skybolt Crisis came to the boil in the UK, an emergency meeting between Macmillan and Kennedy was arranged to take place in Nassau, Bahamas. Accompanying Macmillan were British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Home; Thorneycroft; Sandys; and Zuckerman. Naval expertise was supplied by Vice-Admiral Michael Le Fanu. Ormsby-Gore flew to Nassau with Kennedy. En route, he brokered a deal whereby Britain and the United States would continue development of Skybolt, with each paying half the cost, the American half being a kind of termination fee. In London, over one hundred Conservative members of Parliament, nearly one third of the parliamentary party, signed a motion urging Macmillan to ensure that Britain remained an independent nuclear power.

Talks opened with Macmillan detailing the history of the Anglo-American Special Relationship, going back to the Second World War. He rejected the deal that Kennedy and Ormsby-Gore had reached. It would cost Britain about $100 million (equivalent to $ in ), and was not politically viable in the wake of recent public comments about Skybolt. Kennedy then offered Hound Dog. Macmillan turned this down on technical grounds, although it had not been subjected to a detailed assessment, and probably would have worked for the RAF into the 1970s, as it did for the USAF.

It therefore came down to Polaris, which the US did not wish to supply except as part of a Multinational Force. Macmillan was emphatic that he would commit the submarines to NATO only if they could be withdrawn in case of a national emergency. When pressed by Kennedy as to what sort of emergencies he had in mind, Macmillan mentioned the Soviet threats at the time of the Suez Crisis, Iraqi aggression against Kuwait, or a threat to Singapore. The British nuclear deterrent was not just for deterring attacks on the UK, but to underwrite Britain&#x27;s role as a great power. In the end, Kennedy did not wish to see Macmillan&#x27;s government collapse, which would imperil Britain&#x27;s entry into the EEC, so a face-saving compromise was found, which was released as a joint statement on 21 December 1962: 

==Canadian interlude==
It was customary for the Canadians to be consulted when there was a meeting between the British and American leaders on the North American side of the Atlantic. This nicety was not observed when the Nassau conference was arranged, but the Prime Minister of Canada, John Diefenbaker, invited Macmillan to a meeting in Ottawa. Macmillan countered with an offer to meet in Nassau after the Skybolt issue was resolved. Kennedy and Diefenbaker loathed each other, and Kennedy made plans to leave early to avoid Diefenbaker, but Macmillan persuaded Kennedy to stay for a lunch meeting. Kennedy later described the uncomfortable meeting as being like &quot;three whores at a christening&quot;.

Nuclear weapons had become a political issue in Canada in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when Canadian Bomarc surface-to-air missiles had sat idly by while the country was threatened with a nuclear attack due to Diefenbaker&#x27;s insistence that their nuclear warheads be stored outside Canada, an arrangement which the Americans regarded as impractical. Macmillan briefed Diefenbaker on the Nassau Agreement, which Diefenbaker took to mean that manned bombers were now considered obsolete. This gave him further cause to continue to delay a decision on the Bomarc warheads, which were intended to shoot down bombers. He did, however, express interest in Canadian participation in the Multilateral Force.

==Outcome==
On 22 December, after the Nassau conference had ended, the USAF conducted the sixth and final test flight of Skybolt, having received explicit permission to do so from Roswell Gilpatric, the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, in McNamara&#x27;s absence. The test was a success. Kennedy was furious, but Macmillan remained confident that the Americans had &quot;determined to kill Skybolt on good general grounds—not merely to annoy us or drive Great Britain out of the nuclear business&quot;. The successful test raised the possibility that the USAF might get the Skybolt project reinstated, and the Americans would renege on the Nassau Agreement. This did not occur; Skybolt was officially cancelled on 31 December 1962.

Macmillan placed the Nassau Agreement before the cabinet on 3 January 1963. He made the case for Britain retaining nuclear weapons. He asserted that it would not be in the best interest of the Western Alliance for all knowledge of the technology to reside with the United States; that possession of an independent nuclear capability gave Britain the ability to respond to threats from the Soviet Union even when the United States was not inclined to support Britain; and that possession of nuclear weapons gave Britain a voice in nuclear disarmament talks. However, concerns were expressed that the dependence on the United States would necessarily diminish Britain&#x27;s influence on world affairs. Thorneycroft addressed the view that Britain should provide a nuclear deterrent from its own resources. He pointed out that Polaris represented $800 million (equivalent to $ in ) in research and development costs that the United Kingdom would save. Nonetheless, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd, was still concerned at the cost.
In the wake of the Nassau Agreement, the two governments negotiated the Polaris Sales Agreement, a treaty under the terms of which the US supplied Polaris missiles, which was signed on 6 April 1963. The missiles were equipped with British ET.317 warheads. The UK retained its deterrent force, although its control passed from the RAF to the Royal Navy. Polaris was a better weapon system for the UK&#x27;s needs, and has been referred to as &quot;almost the bargain of the century&quot;, and an &quot;amazing offer&quot;. The V-bombers were immediately reassigned to NATO under the terms of the Nassau Agreement, carrying tactical nuclear weapons, as were the Polaris submarines when they entered service in 1968. The Polaris Sales Agreement was amended in 1980 to provide for the purchase of Trident. British politicians did not like to talk about &quot;dependence&quot; on the United States, preferring to describe the Special Relationship as one of &quot;interdependence&quot;.

As had been feared, the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, vetoed Britain&#x27;s application for admission to the EEC on 14 January 1963, citing the Nassau Agreement as one of the main reasons. He argued that Britain&#x27;s dependence on United States through the purchase of Polaris rendered it unfit to be a member of the EEC. The US policy of attempting to force Britain into their Multilateral Force proved to be a failure in light of this decision, and there was a lack of enthusiasm for it from the other NATO allies too. By 1965, the Multilateral Force was fading away. The NATO Nuclear Planning Group gave NATO members a voice in the planning process without full access to nuclear weapons. The Standing Naval Force Atlantic was established as a joint naval task force, to which various nations contributed ships rather than ships having mixed crews.

In Canada, the Leader of the Opposition, Lester B. Pearson, came out strongly in favour of Canada accepting nuclear weapons. He encountered dissent from within his own Liberal Party, notably from Pierre Trudeau, but opinion polls indicated that he was staking out a position held by the overwhelming majority of Canadians. Nor was Diefenbaker&#x27;s own Progressive Conservative Party united over the issue. On 3 February 1963, Douglas Harkness, the Minister of National Defence, submitted his resignation. Two days later, Diefenbaker&#x27;s government was toppled by a motion of no confidence in the House of Commons of Canada. An election followed, and Pearson became the Prime Minister on 8 April 1963.

Macmillan&#x27;s government lost a series of by-elections in 1962, and was shaken by the Profumo affair in 1963. In October 1963, on the eve of the annual Conservative Party Conference, Macmillan fell ill with what was initially feared to be inoperable prostate cancer. His doctors assured him that it was benign, and that he would make a full recovery, but he took the opportunity to resign on the grounds of ill-health. He was succeeded by Lord Home, who renounced his peerage and as Alec Douglas-Home campaigned on Britain&#x27;s nuclear deterrent in the 1964 election. While the issue was of low importance in the minds of the electorate, it was an issue on which Douglas-Home felt passionately, and on which the majority of voters supported his position. The Labour Party election manifesto called for the Nassau Agreement to be renegotiated, and on 5 October 1964, the leader of the Labour Party, Harold Wilson, criticised the independent British deterrent as neither independent, nor British, nor a deterrent. Douglas-Home narrowly lost the election to Wilson. In office, Labour retained Polaris, and assigned the Polaris boats to NATO, in accord with the Nassau Agreement.

Kennedy, stung by the entire issue, commissioned a detailed report on the events and what lessons could be learned from them by Richard Neustadt, one of his advisors. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis recalled him reading the report and commenting that &quot;If you want to know what my life is like, read this.&quot; The report was declassified in 1992, and published as &quot;Report to JFK: The Skybolt Crisis in Perspective&quot;.

<text>The La France M16K is an M16 rifle modified by the company La France Specialties, which among with other firearm-related activities, convert common military weapons into more compact configurations typically for law enforcement and special forces use.

The M16K was designed by Timothy F. La France, the principal of La France Specialties, formerly of San Diego, California, for use by persons anticipating ambush while in transit. Its short length and unique sighting system was designed to facilitate firing from moving vehicles, where the extra length of even a CAR-15 or XM-177 might create a problem. Its extremely compact envelope also makes it an ideal weapon for helicopter crews, who otherwise would be forced to rely on sidearms for protection in the event of a forced landing.

==Design==
The M16K is a so-called &quot;K&quot; weapon (&quot;K&quot; standing for the German word Kurz meaning short). The La France M16K was basically a standard military M16 rifle chambered for the 5.56 mm cartridge, but modified with an barrel. Like many automatic and semi-automatic weapons the M16 utilizes pressure from the propellant gases in the barrel to cycle the bolt of the firearm. Most automatic weapons use a mechanical device such as a rod and piston between the bolt and the propellant gases. This is not the case in the M16 design in which gases are tapped off the barrel near the muzzle and flow through a tube to directly impinge on the bolt to initiate the auto loading cycle. In a standard issue M16, the gas tube is roughly long to produce an automatic (cyclic) rate of fire of approximately 650 rounds per minute. Shortening the barrel increases the rate of fire significantly and thereby makes the weapon difficult to control and less reliable. To use a significantly shorter barrel than the standard issue without increasing the rate of fire, La France designed (and subsequently patented) an adjustable gas system that would keep the rate of fire the same as with a full-length barrel.

==History==
The M16K was produced by La France beginning in 1982, subsequently a highly modified variation of this gun was developed which was designated the M16K-45 which was chambered for the .45 ACP round and utilizing 20- or 30-round Thompson submachine gun magazines. Except for the magazines this firearm was entirely manufactured by La France and not just a modification of an existing firearm as was case with the original M16K. In the 1990s agreement was entered into between La France Specialties and NAIT to distribute La France Specialty products. La France Specialties was acquired by SureFire, LLC in 2004, and all La France products are still available.

The M16K uses the early Colt AR-15 upper receiver, and therefore lacks the forward assist and shell deflector found on A1 and later upper receivers. The rear sight consists of a metal tube welded onto the carrying handle in place of the original adjustable sight, creating a quasi-ghost ring sight. The handguards are shortened versions of the original triangular handguards. M16Ks make use of the stainless steel twin-tube La France gas system, which greatly increases reliability using the short barrel. The lower receiver is a standard M16 select fire unit. M16Ks are quite rare and very collectible.

The later M16K-45 variant was produced using proprietary upper and lower receivers designed by Timothy F. La France specifically for the .45 ACP round. Both are forgings. The M16K-45 was produced in both a fully automatic Title II version with a short barrel and a semi-automatic version fitted with a 16&quot; barrel to allow it to be sold as a Title I firearm. The barrels are compensated to reduce muzzle climb in fully automatic fire. Production delays resulted in the semi-automatic version not being ready for civilian sales until after enactment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 1994, which impaired sales. When the Federal Assault Weapons Ban lapsed, M16K-45s again became legal for sale.

Fully automatic and semi-automatic versions of the M16K-45 may be obtained from North American Integrated Technologies (NAIT) in Texas, which provided the funding for development, testing and production of the M16K-45 variant. The fully automatic versions are post-May 1986 machine guns, and may only be transferred to available to persons and agencies permitted to have post-May 1986 machine guns under the National Firearms Act. The semi-automatic versions are available for civilian purchase to qualified buyers.

The album includes &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; (1991), which was Freddie Mercury&#x27;s last appearance in a music video, and &quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot; (1997), a song dedicated to Mercury which also features the last recording of bass guitarist John Deacon before his retirement. Four songs from their last studio album &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; (1995) also feature in the compilation, including &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot; and &quot;Heaven for Everyone&quot;.

<text>Thorwald Nicolaus Tideman (, not ; born August 11, 1943, in Chicago, Illinois) is a Georgist economist and professor at Virginia Tech. He received his Bachelor of Arts in economics and mathematics from Reed College in 1965 and his PhD in economics from the University of Chicago in 1969. Tideman was an Assistant Professor of Economics at Harvard University from 1969 to 1973, during which time from 1970 to 1971 he was a Senior Staff Economist for the President&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisors. Since 1973, he has been at Virginia Tech, with various visiting positions at Harvard Kennedy School (1979-1980), University of Buckingham (1985-1986), and the American Institute for Economic Research (1999-2000).

== Research ==
Tideman&#x27;s academic interests include taxation of land, voting theory, and political philosophy. 

=== Ranked Pairs ===

In 1987, he devised the voting system called &quot;ranked pairs&quot; (or the &quot;Tideman method&quot; or simply &quot;RP&quot;), which is a type of Condorcet method. It selects a single winner using votes that express a preference ranking. Ranked pairs can also be used to create a sorted list of winners.

=== Other research ===

In 2000, Tideman developed the CPO-STV proportional voting method. Tideman also devised the independence of clones criterion which both of his methods satisfy. He is an associate of the Earth Rights Institute. His book &quot;Collective Decisions and Voting: The Potential for Public Choice&quot; was published by Ashgate Publishing in November 2006.

<text>Kainuu (), also historically known as Cajania (), is one of the 19 regions of Finland (&quot;maakunta&quot; / &quot;landskap&quot;). Kainuu borders the regions of North Ostrobothnia, North Savo and North Karelia. In the east, it also borders Russia (Republic of Karelia).

Culturally Kainuu is part of larger Eastern-Finnish cultural heritage. The dialect of Kainuu resembles Savonian and Karelian dialects.

==Geography==
Boreal forest makes up most of the biome in Kainuu. The forest in Kainuu mostly consists of birches, pines and spruces. The atypical regional geography and landscape consist of lakes, hills and vast uninhabited forest areas.

The largest lake in the region is the Oulujärvi (928.09 km2), one of the largest lakes in Finland. Its shorelines, open waters and islands in Kainuu belong to the municipalities of Paltamo and Kajaani.

The highest point in Kainuu is the Iso Tuomivaara (385 m), located in the municipality of Hyrynsalmi. The regional climate is continental. The three most populous urban areas in Kainuu (December 31, 2017) are Kajaani town center (30,028), Vuokatti village (6,207) in Sotkamo municipality, and Kuhmo town center (5,349).

==History==
===Pre-history===
The oldest archeological finds of human inhabitation in the area of Kainuu are from around 6800–6000 BCE. The Suomusjärvi culture spread to Kainuu from the south and was strongest around Vaala, which was near the coast of Ancylus Lake. Later finds from the time of the Comb Ceramic culture prove trade connections to the area of Karelia in the east. The Comb Ceramic culture spread to Kainuu quickly, already in the Early Comb Ceramic period (). A style of Comb Ceramic called Säräisniemi Ceramic 1 (&quot;Sär 1&quot;) emerged in Kainuu, North Ostrobothnia, Southern Lapland, Karelia and Northern Norway. Half of &quot;Sär 1&quot; discoveries in Finland are from Kainuu. It is not known where the &quot;Sär 1&quot; style originated from, though the area around the Oulujärvi lake has been suggested. Later, when the Comb Ceramic styles of coastal and inland Finland split into two, the style used in Kainuu was Asbestos-ceramic.

Pre-historic people in Kainuu lived by hunting and fishing, most bone findings in human settlements being of beavers and moose. Findings of flax pollen from the turn of the Bronze Age suggest the cultivating of flax in Paltamo. Around the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age (c. 1000–0 BCE), metallic findings from Kainuu become nearly non-existent. Despite this, it is considered to be unlikely that human inhabitation had ended in the area. It is thought that in this time period, the people spoke a Proto-Sámic language, but archelogical findings culturally linked to Sámi have not been found this south. The spread of the Asbestos-ceramic culture in the north of Fennoscandia has been thought to be a sign of the area turning Sámi. The inhabitants of Kainuu in the Early Iron Age were likely then hunter-gathering Sámi, even if genetically and linguistically differing from modern Sámi. If the population density at the time was the same as among Forest Sámi in Finland in the year 1600 CE, there would&#x27;ve been around 350 individuals living in pre-historic Kainuu.

<doc id="616160" wikidata="Q7205808" url="?curid=616160" title="Plymouth Gin Distillery">
<text>The Plymouth Gin Distillery is a gin manufacturer on The Barbican, Plymouth, England. Also known as the Black Friars Distillery, it is the only gin distillery in the city. The original building opens on to what is now Southside Street. Established in 1793, it is the oldest operating distillery in Britain.

==History==
Local tradition has it that it is located in what was once a Dominican Order monastery, built in 1431, although there is no evidence to support this. It is also said that some of the Pilgrim Fathers may have stayed here while the &quot;Mayflower&quot; was in the harbour for repairs before finally setting sail to North America. This is where the ship on the company label is thought to have originated from.

It was a large merchant&#x27;s house dating from around 1500. By 1605 the building was used as a gaol, and a Congregational meeting house from 1689 to 1705. It was remodelled and extended as a gin distillery from 1793 when Coates joined with the established business of Fox &amp; Williamson. The business was known as Coates &amp; Co. until March 2004.

==Present day==
It is now a bar with bistro above, and the distillery provides several tours. Since 2005 the brand and premises have been owned by the Scandinavian V&amp;S Group, better known for making Absolut Vodka, who in turn were later acquired by Pernod-Ricard.

Plymouth Gin is still made here, and in recent years there has been an increase in the popularity of the distinctive sweeter and lighter but stronger Plymouth flavour, compared to the more usual London Dry Gin. The company has produced a large range of promotional items, including Dartmouth Potteries Gurgle Jugs, miniatures, glasses, ashtrays, match strikers, etc. Many of these have become very collectable.

On the afternoon of 27 February 2008, the building was substantially damaged by a kitchen fire starting in the nearby (and that time recently opened) Barbican Kitchen, which has subsequently re-opened.

<text>Władysław Taczanowski (; 17 March 1819, in Jabłonna, Lublin Voivodeship – 17 January 1890, in Warsaw) was a Polish zoologist and collector of natural history who explored the Russian Far East and northern Africa. He specialized mainly in ornithology but also described numerous other taxa including reptiles and arachnids.

==Life==

A member of an old noble (&quot;szlachta&quot;) magnate family, Taczanowski, from the Poznań region Władysław studied in Lublin and managed the family farm after the death of his father. He then joined government service and served on special missions of the governor of Radom. He joined the Warsaw University Museum in 1855 and began to travel and train at other museums. In 1865 he joined Benedict Dybowski and Victor Godlewski on expeditions to Eastern Russia. In 1862 he succeeded Feliks Paweł Jarocki as curator. Taczanowski took part in an expedition to Algeria with Antoni S. Waga (1866–67) and wrote several significant studies including &quot;Birds of Poland&quot; (1882) and &quot;Ornithology of Peru&quot; (1884-86). He received collections from Cayenne through Constantin Jelski, from the Upper Nile from Counts Alexander and Constantine Branicki. From 1875 he continued to receive specimens from South America after Jean Stolzmann replaced Jelski. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Krakow in 1887.

Species named after him include Taczanowski&#x27;s tinamou (&quot;Nothoprocta taczanowskii)&quot;, the Junin flightless grebe (&quot;Podiceps taczanowskii)&quot;, the mountain paca (&quot;Agouti taczanowskii)&quot;, Taczanowski&#x27;s gudgeon (&quot;Ladislavia taczanowskii)&quot;, and Taczanowski&#x27;s dwarf boa (&quot;Tropidophis taczanowskyi)&quot;.

==Other works==
*&quot;&quot;Les Aranéides de la Guyane française&quot;,&quot; &quot;Horae Societatis entomologicae Rossicae&quot; (1871)
*&quot;&quot;Les Aranéides de la Guyane française&quot;,&quot; &quot;Horae Societatis entomologicae Rossicae&quot; (1873)
*&quot;Les Aranéides du Pérou. Famille des Attidés&quot; (1879)
* Ornithologie du Pérou (1884)

==Tribute==
The fish &quot;Ladislavia taczanowskii&quot; was named for him.

<text>The Russian Republic, referred to as the Russian Democratic Federative Republic in the 1918 Constitution, was a short-lived state which controlled, &quot;de jure&quot;, the territory of the former Russian Empire after its proclamation by the Russian Provisional Government on 1 September (14 September, ) 1917 in a decree signed by Alexander Kerensky as Minister-Chairman and Alexander Zarudny as Minister of Justice.
The government of the Russian Republic was dissolved after the Bolsheviks seized power by force on 7 November 1917. Nonetheless, a partially democratic election of the Constituent Assembly still took place later in November. On 18 January 1918, this assembly issued a decree, proclaiming Russia a democratic federal republic, but was also dissolved by the Bolsheviks on the next day after the proclamation.

The Bolsheviks also used the name &quot;Russian Republic&quot; until the official name &quot;Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic&quot; was adopted in the Constitution of July 1918. The term is sometimes used erroneously for the period between the abdication of the Emperor Nicholas II on 3 March 1917 (16 March, N.S.) and the declaration of the Russian Republic in September. However, during that period the status of the Russian political system was unresolved, left up to be decided by a future elected Constituent Assembly.

== History ==
Following the February Revolution, Emperor Nicholas II abdicated his throne and a Provisional Government was formed, under the leadership of Prince Georgy Lvov. The status of the monarchy was left unresolved.

Officially, the Republic&#x27;s government was the Provisional Government, although &quot;de facto&quot; control of the country was contested between it, the soviets (chiefly the Petrograd Soviet), and various ethnic-based separatists (such as the Central Council of Ukraine). Soviets were political organizations of the proletariat, strongest in industrial regions, and were dominated by left-wing parties. Soviets, whose influence was supplemented with paramilitary forces, were occasionally able to rival the Provisional Government which had an ineffective state apparatus.

During his first weeks as prime minister, Lvov presided over a series of fleeting reforms which sought to radically liberalize Russia. Universal adult suffrage was introduced, freedoms of press and speech were granted, capital punishment abolished, and all legal restrictions of religion, class and race were removed. Unable to rally sufficient support, he resigned in July 1917 in favor of his Minister of War, Alexander Kerensky.

The Government&#x27;s control of the military was tenuous. Seamen of the Baltic Fleet, for example, had far-left views and openly engaged in political activism in the capital. Right-wing proclivities among the army officers were also a problem – Kerensky&#x27;s attempt to dismiss Gen. Lavr Kornilov led to a failed coup.

Following the failure of Kornilov&#x27;s coup, Kerensky proclaimed Russia to be a Republic on 1 September, establishing a Provisional Council as temporary parliament, in preparation to the elections of a Constituent Assembly. However, on 7 November 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power and dissolved both the Provisional Government and the Provisional Council.

Nonetheless, a partially democratic election of the Constituent Assembly still took place later in November. On 18 January 1918, this assembly issued a decree, proclaiming Russia a democratic federal republic under the name &quot;Russian Democratic Federative Republic&quot;, However, the next day the Assembly was dissolved by the Bolsheviks.

The Republic &quot;de jure&quot; continued to exist until the Bolsheviks proclaimed the creation of the Russian Soviet Republic on 25 January 1918. In response, anti-Bolshevik forces proclaimed the Russian State in September 1918, under the leadership of the Provisional All-Russian Government.

<text>Ludwig Georg Elias Moses Bieberbach (; 4 December 1886 – 1 September 1982) was a German mathematician and leading representative of National Socialist German mathematics (&quot;Deutsche Mathematik&quot;).

==Biography==
Born in Goddelau, near Darmstadt, he studied at Heidelberg and under Felix Klein at Göttingen, receiving his doctorate in 1910. His dissertation was titled &quot;On the theory of automorphic functions&quot; (). He began working as a Privatdozent at Königsberg in 1910 and as Professor ordinarius at the University of Basel in 1913. He taught at the University of Frankfurt in 1915 and the University of Berlin from 1921–45.

Bieberbach wrote a habilitation thesis in 1911 about groups of Euclidean motions – identifying conditions under which the group must have a translational subgroup whose vectors span the Euclidean space – that helped solve Hilbert&#x27;s 18th problem. He worked on complex analysis and its applications to other areas in mathematics. He is known for his work on dynamics in several complex variables, where he obtained results similar to Fatou&#x27;s. In 1916 he formulated the Bieberbach conjecture, stating a necessary condition for a holomorphic function to map the open unit disc injectively into the complex plane in terms of the function&#x27;s Taylor series. In 1984 Louis de Branges proved the conjecture (for this reason, the Bieberbach conjecture is sometimes called de Branges&#x27; theorem). There is also a on space groups. In 1928 Bieberbach wrote a book with Issai Schur titled &quot;Über die Minkowskische Reduktiontheorie der positiven quadratischen Formen&quot;.

Bieberbach was a speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held at Zurich in 1932.

==Politics==
Bieberbach joined the Sturmabteilung in 1933 and the NSDAP in 1937. He was enthusiastically involved in the efforts to dismiss his Jewish colleagues, including Edmund Landau and his former coauthor Issai Schur, from their posts. He also facilitated the Gestapo arrests of some close colleagues, such as Juliusz Schauder. Bieberbach was heavily influenced by Theodore Vahlen, another German mathematician and anti-Semite, who along with Bieberbach founded the &quot;Deutsche Mathematik&quot; (&quot;German mathematics&quot;) movement and journal of the same name. The purpose of the movement was to encourage and promote a &quot;German&quot; (in this case meaning intuitionistic) style in mathematics. For example, Bieberbach claimed that &quot;the Cauchy–Goursat theorem arouses intolerable displeasure&quot; in Germans, and was representative of an abstract style of reasoning and &quot;pronounced shrewdness&quot; characteristic of &quot;Jewish mathematics&quot;. Bieberbach&#x27;s and Vahlen&#x27;s idea of German mathematics was part of a wider trend in the scientific community in Nazi Germany towards giving the sciences racial character; there were also pseudoscientific movements for &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot;, &quot;German chemistry&quot;, and &quot;German biology&quot;.

In 1945, Bieberbach was dismissed from all his academic positions because of his support of Nazism, but in 1949 was invited to lecture at the University of Basel by Ostrowski, who considered Bieberbach&#x27;s political views irrelevant to his contributions to mathematics.

<doc id="616188" wikidata="Q4859652" url="?curid=616188" title="Barbican, Plymouth">
<text>The Barbican is the name given to the western and northern sides of Sutton Harbour, the original harbour of Plymouth in Devon, England. It was one of the few parts of the city to escape most of the destruction of The Blitz during the Second World War and the preceding era of slum clearance following the Public Health Act 1848 (11 &amp; 12 Vict. c. 63). Two or three streets still retain some of the architecture of a historic fishing port. The Barbican has the largest concentration of cobbled streets in Britain and contains 100 listed buildings.

==History==

The present Barbican district is generally regarded as being roughly equivalent to the location and size of the medieval walled town of Sutton. A &quot;barbican&quot; is a fortified gate, and here the name probably derives from the &#x27;Castle Barbican&#x27; which was an entrance to Plymouth Castle, the late medieval fortress that guarded access to the Cattewater, prior to the building of the Royal Citadel.

For centuries, the Barbican was home to Plymouth&#x27;s fish market (now relocated to the other side of the harbour) and is still home to many fishermen. One of the oldest streets in Plymouth running north from the Barbican is New Street, which was formerly called Rag Street.

Much historical research and outreach work is done by the Old Plymouth Society and many of the oldest surviving buildings were restored and are still owned and maintained by the Plymouth Barbican Association.

However, many old and significant buildings were demolished during the late 19th and first half of the 20th centuries, which had decayed into unsanitary and heavily overcrowded slum tenements following the removal of wealthy merchant landowners to country estates and the subdivision of &#x27;Golden Era&#x27; Elizabethan properties which had once been grand, reflecting the wealth and prosperity of the city at the time. A government survey following the Public Health Acts indicated that overcrowding in Plymouth Sutton was amongst the worst in western Europe comparable only with Warsaw, with families of up to 10 occupying a single room tenancy.

The Plymouth Gin Distillery has been producing Plymouth Gin since 1793, which was exported around the world by the Royal Navy. During the 1930s, it was the most widely distributed gin and has a protected designation of origin.

==Places of interest==

Places of interest include the National Marine Aquarium (technically in Coxside) which is one of the larger aquaria in Britain and has one of the deepest tanks in Europe; the Elizabethan House, an old house built in the early 16th century, now used as a museum; the Mayflower Steps near where the Pilgrims finally set off in the Mayflower for the New World in 1620, which is described in the nearby visitors&#x27; centre; and the studio gallery of the late painter and eccentric Robert Lenkiewicz, who lived and worked on the Barbican for many years deriving much of his inspiration and income from the local community.
The Barbican also contains a variety of shops and businesses including the Barbican Theatre, retail art galleries, the Plymouth Gin Distillery, the Dolphin Inn, Plymouth and numerous bars and eating places.

==Culture==
The Barbican boasts some underground culture, from live music to Stone Soup Story Tellers evenings and festivals. The promenade of the Parade, shown above, paved with the traditional granite setts, is now filled by seating in glass-sided enclosures with large square umbrellas and infra-red heaters providing all-weather space.

==Developments==
The harbour was enclosed by a lock in 1993, designed both to provide a constant adequate depth of water for fishing and pleasure craft and to reduce the risk of flood damage being caused to low-lying property. In the same year, the Victorian fish market at the eastern end of Southside Street was closed and the modern fish market opened across Sutton Harbour at Coxside. This has been very successful and the auctions are some of the busiest on the south coast. There is much activity around the market quay as trawlers and small fishing boats arrive to offload their catches.

During the last two decades accelerating developments have taken place around most of Sutton Pool area. This has mostly involved the building of distinctive modern style waterside blocks of flats which have prevented the realisation of David Mackay&#x27;s plan for a seafront &#x27;gateway&#x27; from Sutton Pool into the city centre which would have required the clearing of many of the few remaining historical streets and the redevelopment of Bretonside Bus Station. There has also been adverse comment about the recent extension of the many marina pontoons severely limiting the area of open water.

<doc id="616197" wikidata="Q3395662" url="?curid=616197" title="1979 Scottish devolution referendum">
<text>A post-legislative referendum was held in Scotland in 1979 to decide whether there was a sufficient support for a Scottish Assembly proposed in the Scotland Act 1978 among the Scottish electorate. This was an act to create a devolved deliberative assembly for Scotland. A majority (51.6%) of voters supported the proposal, but an amendment to the Act stipulated that it would be repealed if less than 40% of the total electorate voted in favour. As there was a turnout of 64% the &quot;Yes&quot; vote represented only 32.9% of the registered electorate, and the act was subsequently repealed.

A second referendum to create a devolved legislature in Scotland was held in 1997 under a newly elected Labour government, which led to the enactment of the Scotland Act 1998 and the creation of a devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999.

==Background==

===Kilbrandon Commission===
Following the Scottish National Party gaining its first peacetime MP in the 1967 Hamilton by-election and Plaid Cymru&#x27;s first win at the 1966 Carmarthen by-election in Wales, the United Kingdom government set up the Royal Commission on the Constitution, referred to as the &quot;Kilbrandon Commission&quot;, in 1969. The royal commission was intended to look at the constitutional structure of the United Kingdom and consider changes that should be made. The final report was published in 1973.

The commission examined various models of devolution, federalism and confederalism, on top of the break-up of the UK into separate sovereign states.

In relation to Scotland, eight of the commission&#x27;s members supported a Scottish Assembly, via a devolved structure. It would recommended that the assembly would have around 100 members, elected under single transferable vote from multi-member constituencies. The assembly would obtain powers in the areas of education, environment, health, home affairs, legal matters and social services, while agriculture, fisheries and food would be divided between the assembly and the UK government.

===Previous Legislation===
After returning to power with a minority government in February 1974 election, Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government published a white paper entitled &quot;Democracy and Devolution: Proposals for Scotland and Wales&quot;, published in September 1974. The party gained a narrow majority of three seats in the election in October.

By 1976, the Labour government, now led by James Callaghan, had lost its parliamentary majority entirely following a series of adverse by-election results. To provide a stable majority in the House of Commons, the government made an agreement with the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru whereby, in return for their support in Commons votes, the government would instigate legislation to devolve political powers from Westminster to Scotland and Wales.

The &quot;Scotland and Wales Bill&quot; was subsequently introduced in November 1976, but the government struggled to get the legislation through parliament. The Conservative opposition opposed its second reading, and on the first day of committee 350 amendments were put down. Progress slowed to a crawl. In February 1977, the Bill&#x27;s cabinet sponsor Michael Foot tabled a guillotine motion to attempt to halt the delays. The motion was rejected and the government was forced to withdraw the Bill.

==Scotland Act 1978==
The government returned to the issue of devolution in November 1977. Separate bills for Scotland and Wales were published and support from the Liberals was obtained. In spite of continued opposition requiring another guillotine motion, the Bills were passed. During the passage of the Scotland Act 1978 through Parliament, an amendment introduced by Labour MP George Cunningham added a requirement that the bill had to be approved by 40% of the total registered electorate, as well as a simple majority (50% + 1).

===Proposed Assembly===
Had the Scotland Act 1978 entered force, it would have created a Scottish Assembly with limited legislative powers. There would have been a Scottish Executive headed by a &quot;First Secretary&quot;, taking over some of the functions of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Meetings of the Scottish Assembly would have been held at the Old Royal High School in Regent Road, Edinburgh. The former school hall was adapted for use by the Scottish Assembly, including the installation of microphones and new olive-green leather seating. Members would have been elected by the &quot;first past the post&quot; system.

The Scottish Assembly would have had the power to introduce primary legislation to be known as &quot;Measures&quot; (rather than Acts) within defined areas of competence. This form of legislation would not receive royal assent like Acts of Parliament do. Instead, the legislation is signed via an Order in Council, which the monarch signs and appends to the assembly measure once passed. Some new offices would have been created, such as a Comptroller and Auditor General for Scotland.

The areas of responsibility included:
*Education
*The environment
*Health
*Home affairs
*Legal matters
*Social services

Responsibility for agriculture, fisheries and food would have been divided between the Assembly and the United Kingdom government, while the latter would have retained control of electricity supply.

==Opinion polling==


==Result==


==Aftermath==
The result was a majority in favour of devolution. A total of 1,230,937 (51.6%) voted at the referendum in favour of an Assembly, a majority of about 77,400 over those voting against. However, this total represented only 32.9% of the registered electorate as a whole. The Labour government held that the Act&#x27;s requirements had not been met, and that devolution would therefore not be introduced for Scotland.

In the wake of the referendum the disappointed supporters of the bill conducted a protest campaign under the slogan &quot;Scotland said &#x27;yes, officially launched in a Glasgow hotel on 7 March 1979. In particular, the Scottish National Party (SNP) carried out a survey of the electoral register in the Edinburgh Central constituency. This appeared to show that the register was so out of date that even in an area where major support for a &quot;yes&quot; vote might be expected, achievement of 40% of the electorate was virtually unattainable. This was because the majority of electors lived in older tenements or newer Council blocks of flats where flat numbers were not specified. The work of electoral registration staff to obtain an accurate current register was almost impossible.

Under the terms of the Act, it could then be repealed by a Statutory instrument to be approved by Parliament. The government&#x27;s decision to abandon devolution led the SNP to withdraw its support for the Labour government. It was in a minority in Parliament and had relied on deals with the smaller parties, including the SNP, for its survival. After establishing that the Liberals and the SNP would vote against the government in a confidence motion, the Conservative opposition tabled a motion on 28 March. The government was defeated by one vote, and a UK general election was subsequently called. This was won by the Conservatives, and Parliament voted to repeal the Act on 20 June 1979.

A second referendum to create a devolved legislature in Scotland was held in 1997 under a newly elected Labour government, which led to the enactment of the Scotland Act 1998 and the creation of a devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999.

<text>Satakunta (in both Finnish and Swedish, ; historically &quot;Satacundia&quot;) is a region ( / ) of Finland, part of the former Western Finland Province. It borders the regions of Southwest Finland, Pirkanmaa, South Ostrobothnia and Ostrobothnia. The capital city of the region is Pori. The name of the region literally means hundred. The historical province of the same name was a larger area within Finland, covering modern Satakunta as well as much of Pirkanmaa.

== Heraldry ==
The arms are crowned by a ducal coronet, though in Finnish tradition this resembles a Swedish count&#x27;s coronet. Blazon: &quot;Per fess Azure and Or, a bear rampant Sable, armed and langued Gules, crowned Or, holding in both paws a sword Argent, sword handle Or; surmounted by two mullets of seven Argent&quot;.

== History ==

According to one theory, Satakunta was a political and military entity already in the Late Iron Age of Finland (550 - 1150 AD). During the 13th century, the Swedish rule was consolidated. At the same time, the coastal strip received some Swedish inhabitants, who however were assimilated in the mainstream Finnish population. The remnant of the influx can be seen in some of the toponyms in coastal Satakunta (e.g. Noormarkku &lt; ). Genetically connections to Scandinavia seem to be relatively strong. Haplogroup I1 (Y-DNA), which is typically Scandinavian, is very common in Satakunta. The common ancestor with the closest (rare) Scandinavian branches lived at least 2300 years ago.

During the Middle Ages, the major cities of the province were Ulvila, established in the 14th century and Rauma, established 1442. Due to the rising of land, the former was left inland and lost its access to the sea. Consequently, the city of Pori was founded to the coast by Johan, Grand Duke of Finland in 1558. Administratively, the province lost its function in 1649 when it was combined with Southwest Finland to form Turku and Pori County. In the 19th century, the eastern parts of the province were transferred to the Tavastia County. At the present, the eastern part of the old province has formed the region of Pirkanmaa and the western part forms the region of Satakunta.

Satakunta, with the rest of Finland, was separated from Sweden when Finland was ceded to Russia in 1809. During the era of Autonomy (1809–1917), the province experienced slow industrialization, Pori becoming the most important industrial city of the region. The forest and textile industries dominated the business life. In addition, the merchants of Rauma and Pori had impressively large fleets of sailpowered merchantmen, which made up a large fraction of the total merchant navy of the Russian empire. The large-scale use of sail ships continued until the 1930s, even while the steampower started to dominate the international seatraffic. The building of the Tampere–Pori and Kokemäki–Rauma railroads connected the province into Finnish inland and diminished the importance of unnavigable Kokemäenjoki river as a means of transport. After this, the ports of Rauma and Pori have remained among the most important export ports for the Finnish industry.

The development of agriculture towards market-based economy was started during the 18th century, when crop rotation and large-scale drainage projects were initiated. At the same time, clearing of forests for agricultural use continued, leading into the formation of a large crofter class (), living on small-holdings rented from larger farms. During the 19th century the social divisions among the rural population deepened. Consequently, in Finnish Civil War of 1918, Satakunta formed an important part of Red Finland.

Since independence, the development of Satakunta has followed the general Finnish pattern. The rural areas have suffered from the drain of young population towards population centers, which until the early 1990s benefited the industrial cities of Rauma, Harjavalta and Pori with their surroundings. The metal and forest industries expanded steadily, necessitating the building of the nuclear plant at Olkiluoto. The increase of industrial production was not fully without problems, however. Especially the area around Harjavalta copper–nickel smelting plant suffered heavily from acid rain and Kokemäenjoki became heavily polluted. These problems have been controlled to large extent since the 1980s.

Since the 1990s, the traditional industries of the region have more or less stagnated and the relative importance of her cities has dwindled. One of the perceived reasons for this development has been the fact that Satakunta lacks a university of its own.

==Geography==

The exact borders of Satakunta towards Southwest Finland, Ostrobothnia and Southern Tavastia are rather well-defined. However, this is not the case with the Northern Tavastia, i.e. in the modern day region of Pirkanmaa. This is because northern parts of Pirkanmaa were only sparsely inhabited wilderness and the borders of the provinces were never well defined before the introduction of county system in 1634. In that year, the border between Turku and Pori County which included Satakunta, and Uusimaa and Tavastia county was rather arbitrarily drawn in Tammerkoski. To further complicate matters, Tampere with her surroundings was transferred to Tavastia Province in the 19th century. As a result, the region around Ikaalinen and Parkano is variously described as being part of Satakunta, Tavastia, &quot;Sata-Häme&quot; or Pirkanmaa.
Satakunta is characterized by a strong contrast of coast and inland areas. The southernmost part of the coast is flanked by the archipelago of Rauma but towards north, the number of coastal islands decreases markedly. The seabed is flat and due to this, the still-continuing post-glacial rising is perceivable even during a single person&#x27;s lifetime. The dominating feature of the northern coast of Satakunta is the delta of Kokemäenjoki northwest of the town of Pori.

The valley of river Kokemäenjoki and the area south of it form one of the most important agricultural regions of Finland. The main crops are rye, barley, potato and sugar beet. On the other hand, north of Kokemäenjoki valley, forests dominate the landscape and population density is much lower than in southern Satakunta. Towards inland, the flat agricultural plain gives way to a more hilly landscape blotted by lakes. In this area, the population centers are located along the most important waterways, as a result of the original inhabitation period.

==Economy==

In 2019, the biggest tax payers in Satakunta were Boliden Harjavalta, Raumaster, Forchem, Länsi-Suomen Osuuspankki, Oras, Alfa Laval Aalborg and LähiTapiola Lännen.

<text>Charles Wallace Richmond (December 31, 1868 – May 19, 1932) was an American ornithologist. He is best remembered for a compilation of the Latin names of birds that is called the Richmond Index.

==Life and work==
He was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin and was the eldest son of Edward Leslie and Josephine Ellen Richmond. His mother died when he was 12. His father who was a railway mail clerk moved to Washington, D.C., and joined the Government Printing House there. His father remarried and he had the additional duty of taking care of younger stepbrothers. During his early life he earned extra income for the family by leaving school and working as a page in the House of Representatives. At the age of 15 he got a position as a messenger in the Geological Survey. In 1897 he graduated after studied medicine in Georgetown University and in the next year he married Louise H. Seville.

While still at Wisconsin he had collected the eggs of a Kingbird and when he moved to Washington, in 1881. He visited the Smithsonian Institution museum and seeing the large collection of nests and eggs he decided that he would never produce such a collection himself and decided to hand over his own collections to the museum. This led him to meet Robert Ridgway. He subsequently met Ridgway often and this early influence was very strong. His work in the House of Representatives let him use the library there which had a good collection of books on birds.

In 1888, Richmond took part in a United States Geological Survey expedition to Montana. He became an ornithological clerk at the United States Department of Agriculture. After a collecting trip to Nicaragua he joined the staff of the United States National Museum in Washington, D.C., as a nightwatchman. He was promoted to Aid, followed by Assistant in the birds department. He became Associate Curator of Birds in 1894. Richmond then became Associate Curator in 1918. He moved up to Curator in 1929, but stepped back to stay as Associate Curator, so that Herbert Friedmann could become Curator.

==Research==

Richmond started a card catalog when he was twenty one. He continued to maintain the catalog throughout his life. Research wise he focused on naming authorities for bird names, and was considered the foremost expert on the subject. His card catalog continues to be utilized by ornithologists, today.

==Legacy==

The scientific name of the northern cardinal, &quot;Richmondena cardinalis&quot;, was named in his honor, as was the wrasse, &quot;Halichoeres richmondi&quot;.

<text>Henry James Pye (; 20 February 1745 – 11 August 1813) was an English poet, and Poet Laureate from 1790 until his death. His appointment owed nothing to poetic achievement and was probably a reward for political favours. Pye was merely a competent prose writer, who fancied himself as a poet, earning the derisive label of poetaster.

==Life==
Pye was born in London, the son of Henry Pye of Faringdon House in Berkshire, and his wife, Mary James. He was the nephew of Admiral Thomas Pye. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford. His father died in 1766, leaving him a legacy of debt amounting to £50,000, and the burning of the family home further increased his difficulties.

In 1784 he was elected Member of Parliament for Berkshire. He was obliged to sell the paternal estate, and, retiring from Parliament in 1790, became a police magistrate for Westminster. Although he had no command of language and was destitute of poetic feeling, his ambition was to obtain recognition as a poet, and he published many volumes of verse.

Of all he wrote, his prose &quot;Summary of the Duties of a Justice of the Peace out of Sessions&quot; (1808) is most worthy of record. He was made poet laureate in 1790, perhaps as a reward for his faithful support of William Pitt the Younger in the House of Commons. The appointment was looked on as ridiculous, and his birthday odes were a continual source of contempt. The 20th-century British historian Lord Blake called Pye &quot;the worst Poet Laureate in English history with the possible exception of Alfred Austin&quot;. Indeed, Pye&#x27;s successor, Robert Southey, wrote in 1814: &quot;I have been rhyming as doggedly and dully as if my name had been Henry James Pye.&quot; He was the first poet laureate to receive a fixed salary of £270 instead of the historic tierce of Canary wine. After his death, Pye remained one of the unfortunates who have been classified as a &quot;poetaster&quot;.

As a prose writer, Pye was far from contemptible. He had a fancy for commentaries and summaries. His &quot;Commentary on Shakespeare&#x27;s commentators&quot;, and that appended to his translation of the Poetics, contain some noteworthy matter. A man, who, born in 1745, could write &quot;Sir Charles Grandison is a much more unnatural character than Caliban,&quot; may have been a poetaster but was certainly not a fool.

He died in Pinner, Middlesex on 11 August 1813. He is buried in Pinner&#x27;s parish church of St John the Baptist.

Pye married twice. He had two daughters by his first wife. He married secondly in 1801 Martha Corbett, by whom he had a son, Henry John Pye, who in 1833 inherited the Clifton Hall, Staffordshire estate of a distant cousin and who was High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1840.

<text>Edmund Gustavus Bloomfield Meade-Waldo (8 February 1855 – 24 February 1934) was an English ornithologist and conservationist. He is probably best known for his efforts to preserve the red kite in Wales.

Meade-Waldo was born in Hever Castle and educated at Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge University. He spent his life managing the family&#x27;s country estate, Stonewall, in Kent. He conducted fieldwork and collected birds in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the Canary Islands and Spain, the presumably-extinct Canary Islands oystercatcher &quot;Haematopus meadewaldoi&quot; being foremost among them. He was vice-president of the BOU in 1923 and was an active member of the Zoological Society of London, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Society for the Protection of the Fauna of the Empire and the Society for the Establishment of Nature Reserves. He was also Justice of the Peace for Kent.

Meade-Waldo&#x27;s discovery of sandgrouse chick rearing behaviour in 1896 was for a long time discredited as fantasy. His acute observations noted male sandgrouse, by deliberately soaking their breast feathers in water, bringing water to its chicks at the nest. Sixty years later he was proved right.

He accompanied James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford and the naturalist Michael John Nicoll on their third voyage on the RYS Valhalla; on 7 December 1905 at about 10:15 am the yacht, was cruising off the Florida coast when a &quot;large fin, or frill, sticking out of the water,&quot; was spotted. This frill was six feet in length and projected nearly two feet out of the water. &quot;A great neck rose out of the water in front of the frill,&quot; noted Meade-Waldo; its neck appeared to be about the thickness of a man&#x27;s body. This creature moved its head and neck from side to side in a peculiar manner. This &quot;sea serpent&quot; incident became famous and caused much interest back home in Britain.

<text>Soria () is a municipality and a Spanish city, located on the Douro river in the east of the autonomous community of Castile and León and capital of the province of Soria. Its population is 38,881 (INE, 2017), 43.7% of the provincial population. The municipality has a surface area of 271,77 km2, with a density of 144.97 inhabitants/km2. Situated at about 1065 metres above sea level, Soria is the second highest provincial capital in Spain.

Although there are remains of settlements from the Iron Age and Celtiberian times, Soria itself enters history with its repopulation between 1109 and 1114, by the Aragonese king Alfonso I the Battler. A strategic enclave due to the struggles for territory between the kingdoms of Castile, Navarre and Aragon, Soria became part of Castile definitively in 1134, during the reign of Alfonso VII. Alfonso VIII was born in Soria, and Alfonso X had his court established when he received the offer to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. In Soria, the deposed king James IV of Mallorca died, and John I of Castile married. Booming during the Late Middle Ages thanks to its border location and its control over the cattle industry, Soria went into a slow decline over the next few centuries. It was damaged greatly during the Peninsular War.

The city preserves an important architectural heritage (extensive medieval walls, Renaissance palaces and architecturally distinctive Romanesque churches) and is home to the Numantine Museum (with pieces from the nearby Celtiberian city of Numantia). Soria&#x27;s football team CD Numancia is named after this city. It is one of the smallest cities to ever have had a team in Spain&#x27;s top division La Liga.

Today, its population of 38,881 makes Soria the least populated provincial capital of Castile and León and the second least populated in Spain (after Teruel). Particularly important in its economy is the agri-food industry, while an increasing number of tourists are attracted by its cultural heritage. Soria was mentioned by UNESCO as a good example when including the Mediterranean diet in its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

== Name ==

It is claimed that in Roman times there was a castle called Oria, purportedly named after a Greek knight called Doricus. Based on this folk etymology, some historians guessed that the first inhabitants of this city might have been the Dorians. Archaeology has not confirmed that story. Instead it has suggested that the first inhabitants were the Suebi, whose kings (as reported by Tutor and Malo in their &quot;Compedio historial de las dos Numancias&quot;) established one of their courts there. These two hypotheses have been abandoned because of lack of evidence. It seems more likely that the name &quot;Soria&quot; may have its origin in the word &quot;dauria&quot; from the river &quot;Durius&quot; (Douro).

== Shield ==

The shield of Soria has the following heraldic description:

The king in the coat of arms is Alfonso VIII, born in Soria, and the red field represents the blood shed by the Sorians, particularly in the battles of Alarcos, Navas de Tolosa and Aljubarrota.

The oldest preserved example of the coat of arms is found in the high-medieval bell of San Gil, today the Church of Nuestra Señora de la Mayor, which already reflected the city&#x27;s motto. Unlike the current official coat of arms, the king who now appears on the bust of the castle&#x27;s keep on the castle&#x27;s bell tower, is represented in the bell of San Gil with his entire body at the foot of the castle, leaving through its door.

== History ==

The first recorded inhabitants in the area of Soria were the Celtiberians, around the 4th century BC.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the rebuilt city was occupied by the Suebi. Later, after the Arab conquest of Spain, it grew in importance due to its proximity to the border of the Christian lands, which in the 8th century had settled along the Duero river.

In 869 Soria was the centre of the rebellion of Suleyman ibn-Abus against the emir of Córdoba, who sent his son Hakan to quench it.

Alfonso I of Aragon and Navarre, the Battler seized the territory away from the sphere of the Kingdom of León, controlling the territory from 1109 to 1134, entrusting the role of first tenant of Soria to Íñigo López already by 1119, when the effective repopulation should have started, although there are claims tracing it back some time earlier. Soria was granted a short &quot;fuero&quot; in March 1120, that also fixed limits to the medieval &quot;concejo&quot;. After the death of Alfonso I in 1134, Alfonso VII of León, the Emperor took control of the territory. The short &quot;fuero&quot; was confirmed by Alfonso VII in 1143.

Due to its strategic placement at the borders of the Kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Navarre and León, Soria in the Middle Ages was at the centre of several conflicts between them. Alfonso VIII of Castile, in reward for its support, gave the city several privileges which it maintained until modern times. In 1195 the town was stormed by Sancho VII of Navarre, but later recovered and continued to develop its splendour and trades.

Soria lost most of its importance after the unification of Aragón and Castile in 1479, and above all after the decree of exile issued against the Jews in 1492. In the War of Spanish Succession (early 18th century), Soria sided for Philip V. In 1808 it was captured and set on fire by the French troops.

The economical and social crisis of Spain in the early 20th century, and the Spanish Civil War with Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship which followed, had negative effects on Soria and its neighborhood, which became depopulated due to strong emigration.

The policy of the current authorities aims to strengthen the local economy pivoting on Soria&#x27;s tourism potential, and has also launched a programme of reconstruction for the neighbouring villages.

== Culture ==
The poet Antonio Machado (1875–1939) spent five years in Soria teaching French in a secondary school, before moving to Segovia nearer Madrid. These years in Soria proved significant in his literary development. He married and lost his wife there and discovered much about the nature of the Castilian people – a subject the Generation of &#x27;98 authors were very interested in. &quot;Campos de Soria&quot; was a series of poems lamenting his wife&#x27;s early death. They formed part of a major collection &quot;Campos de Castilla&quot;.

The firewalking rituals performed at the Sorian village of San Pedro Manrique every June as part of the festival of San Juan have been declared as a tradition of National Tourist Interest and have attracted global attention through ethnographic and scientific studies and media coverage.

=== Religion ===
Although Soria never was a bishopric, its St. Peter&#x27;s Church became the Co-Cathedral of the bishopric of Osma when that was renamed Roman Catholic Diocese of Osma-Soria on 9 March 1959. The province of Soria has a Minor Basilica, the Marian Basílica de Nuestra Señora de los Milagros, in Ágreda.

A few kilometres north of the town are the ruins of Numantia, a Celtiberian town whose inhabitants destroyed it rather than let it fall to Scipio. In Soria is the &quot;Museo Numantino&quot;, devoted to the archaeological remains of this and other sites in the province.

== Transportation ==

The city is served by the Soria Railway Station, with daily services to Madrid via Guadalajara. There are also many bus lines to neighbouring cities. A new highway has reduced the trip to Madrid by car down to 2 hours.

== Geography ==
Soria sits on the banks of Douro river, in its upper course. Its municipality is formed by the city, and four rural hamlets: Las Casas, Oteruelos, Pedrajas and Toledillo; both Oteruelos and Pedrajas were small municipalities later absorbed by Soria by the 1970s. The shape of the municipality is highly irregular and it is not even continuous, as it comprises three disjointed areas.

=== Climate ===

Soria has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Due to its altitude, winters in Soria are very cold by Spanish standards ( in January) with almost 84 frost days per year. Summers are dry and warm (average in July) with the daytime temperature usually around . Temperatures above are not rare in summer, while lows can go under at nights. It has scant rainfall () and spring is the wettest season. The low rainfall is in spite of its high elevation as the maritime Atlantic low-pressure systems are often blocked by the mountains closer to the coast. It is the coldest Spanish provincial capital.

== Sport ==

The city&#x27;s professional football club is called CD Numancia.

Two of Spain&#x27;s foremost runners of the late 20th century lived and trained in Soria: Fermín Cacho, a gold medallist at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and Abel Antón, a two-time World Champion in the marathon. The area in which they trained, Monte Valonsadero, is now host to the annual Cross Internacional de Soria meeting – one of Spain&#x27;s most prestigious cross country running competitions.

The European Youth Orienteering Championships were held in Soria in July 2010.

== Economy ==

== Municipal services ==

Soria has a biomass district heating plant called &quot;Red de Calor de Soria&quot;, which uses woodchip residue fuel from the local timber industry. Venture capital firm AXIS, part of Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO), the Spanish promotional bank, has made an equity investment in the project. The project plans to provide 80 GWh of renewable energy per year, which will heat 8,000 homes, saving 28,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

== Twin towns ==

* 1994 — Collioure (France)

== Notable people ==

* Saint Saturius of Soria
* Javier Modrego
* Shem Tov ben Abraham ibn Gaon (1283 – c. 1330), a Jewish Talmudist and kabbalist

<text>The M240 machine gun, officially the Machine Gun, 7.62 mm, M240, is the U.S. military designation for the FN MAG, a family of belt-fed, gas-operated medium machine guns that chamber the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge.

The M240 has been used by the United States Armed Forces since the late 1970s. It is used extensively by infantry, most often in rifle companies, as well as on ground vehicles, watercraft and aircraft. Though it is heavier than some comparable weapons, it is highly regarded for reliability and its standardization among NATO members is a major advantage.

All variants are fed from disintegrating belts and are capable of firing most types of 7.62 NATO ammunition. M240 variants can be converted to use non-disintegrating belts. There are significant differences in weight and some features among some versions which restrict the interchangeability of parts. The M240s used by the U.S. military are currently manufactured by FN America, the American subsidiary of the Belgian company FN Herstal.

The M240B and M240G are usually fired from integrated bipods, tripods, or vehicular mounts; regarding tripod use, the U.S. Army primarily uses the M192 lightweight ground mount, while the U.S. Marine Corps uses the M122A1 tripod, a slightly updated M2 tripod.

==History==
=== Development ===
Manufactured by the American division of the Belgian company Fabrique Nationale d&#x27;Herstal, the FN MAG was chosen by the U.S. military for different roles after large worldwide searches and competitions. The MAG is a belt-fed, gas-operated, air-cooled, crew-served, general-purpose machine gun. Its versatility is demonstrated by its ability to be fired effectively from its integral bipod, mounted on a tripod, on ground vehicles, watercraft and aircraft.

It was first adopted by the U.S. Army in 1977, as a coaxial tank gun, and slowly adopted for more applications in the 1980s and 1990s. The M240 and M240E1 were adopted for use on vehicles. This led to further adoption in more uses, especially for the Army and Marine Corps infantry.

While possessing many of the same basic characteristics as its predecessor, the durability of the MAG system results in superior reliability when compared to the M60. The MAG actually has a more complex gas system than the M60, but gives better reliability combined with lower maintenance requirements, though this comes at greater manufacturing cost and weight.

Compared to other machine guns, its rating of 26,000 mean rounds between failure (MRBF) is quite high for its weight – in the 1970s when it was first adopted it achieved about 7,000 MRBF. It is not as reliable as some very heavy older designs, but it is quite reliable for its mass.

===Testing and adoption===
The U.S. adoption of the MAG has its origins in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a project to procure a new coaxially mounted 7.62 mm machine gun for tanks to replace the M73 and M219 machine guns then being used. The 1950s-era M73 had been rather troubled, and the derivative M73E1/M219 was not much of an improvement. A number of designs of the period from various countries were considered; the final two candidates were the M60E2 and the FN MAG, which underwent comprehensive testing alongside the older M219 for comparison.

Two main criteria analyzed were &quot;mean rounds between stoppages&quot; (MRBS, malfunctions that can be cleared within minutes) and &quot;mean rounds between failures&quot; (MRBF, such as a part breaking). The results for the evaluated machine guns were the following:


The MAG itself underwent some improvements and the M60E2 was a specialized coaxial variant that differed from some of the other types. The qualities of the M60 variants vary considerably, such as between the M60E4 and the M60C. The clear winner was the MAG, which was designated as the M240 in 1977 after the army competition.

The M240 was adopted as the U.S. Army&#x27;s standard vehicle machine gun in 1977. The Marine Corps also adopted the M240 and M240E1 for use on vehicles like the LAV-25. It then went on to replace many older types of vehicle machine guns in the 1980s. U.S. Navy SEALs continued to use the &quot;CAR-60&quot; (M60E3) version of the M60 machine gun due to its lighter weight and slower rate of fire, which allows a more effective duration of fire with allowable levels of ammunition carried.

The M240 proved popular enough that it was adapted by the infantry later on, as the M240G and M240B. The USMC adopted the M240G for this role in 1991, where it not only replaced the original M60s used by the Marine Corps infantry, but also the upgraded M60E3 that the Marines had started using in the 1980s. In the late 1990s, the Army adopted the M240B for the infantry role – they had considered the M60E4, which (though lighter and cheaper) did not offer commonality with the vehicle-borne M240, other FN MAG users within NATO, or the USMC.

The various versions of the M240 have not entirely replaced all the M60 versions, though they have for most main applications and roles. The M60 is still, in some cases, used by the Navy.

====2022 military solicitation====
As of March 2022, the United States Army had a solicitation ongoing for a M240 machine gun 6.8×51mm conversion kit to modify the 7.62×51mm NATO-chambered M240B and M240L general-purpose machine guns to fire the 6.8×51mm ammunition.

==Design details==

The weapon fires from the open bolt position, meaning that the bolt is held to the rear and only moves forward as it is firing a round. The firing pin is static and the bolt moves around the firing pin, circumventing any need for a hammer. A sear is used to time the internal mechanisms of the weapon to provide a consistent rate of fire, ensuring proper function and accuracy.

The rate of fire may be controlled by three different gas regulator settings. The first setting allows the weapon to cycle at 650–750 rounds per minute, the second setting being 750–850 rounds per minute, and the third setting being 850–950 rounds per minute. These settings are changed by dismounting the barrel, removing the gas regulator collar and turning the gas regulator to allow more or less gas to move through the weapon system. It is generally performed only when necessary to return the gun to operation after fouling has caused sluggish operation and there is no time to properly clean the weapon.

The barrels can be exchanged rapidly, via a barrel release button located on the left side of the weapon. The weapon is cleared first and then the button is held down, while the barrel&#x27;s carrying handle is moved from the right side of the weapon to the center, unlocking it from the receiver. At this point, the button is released and the barrel is then pulled free of the receiver and placed to the side. The new barrel is inserted into the receiver and then the carrying handle is shifted to the right, locking it into place.

During prolonged firing, the barrels can become hot enough to inflict second-degree burns instantly without becoming visibly different.

==Variants==

FN Herstal first introduced the MAG general-purpose machinegun in the early 1950s. The M240 is the US military&#x27;s adoption of the FN MAG. Parts compatibly of other MAG variants adopted by other NATO members are interchangeable. This has significant advantages in training, logistics support, tactical versatility, and joint operations.

===M240===
The M240 is adapted as a coaxial machine gun for tanks and 7.62 mm fire power on light armored vehicles. The M240 is part of the secondary armament on the U.S. Army M1 series Abrams tank, M2/M3 series Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the U.S. Marine Corps LAV-25.

The M240E1 is the U.S. Marine Corps version of the original M240 coaxial/pintle-mounted machine gun that is used on vehicles like the LAV-25. It can also be fitted with spade grips for flexible use, like the ones from the M240D.

The M240C is the right-hand variant on the original coaxial (installed alongside the main weapon) M240, it is identical to the M240 except for the ammunition cover and feed tray. It has a right-handed feed for use on the M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle and LAV as the coaxial machine gun. It is fed from the left on the M1 Abrams and other M1 variant (M1A1, M1A2, M1A2 SEP) tanks. The M240C uses a charging cable instead of a charging handle, has a cut-off pistol grip and has a special paddle assembly that allows the trigger to be actuated by means of a solenoid. Since the machine gun is not meant to be handled during use, the barrel is fully exposed and must be handled with asbestos mittens during barrel changes.

The rate of fire of the M240, M240E1, and M240C can be controlled by three different gas regulator settings;
* The first setting allows the weapon to have a cyclic rate of fire of around 650–750 rounds per minute,
* The second setting allows the weapon to have a cyclic rate of fire of around 750–850 rounds per minute,
* The third setting allows the weapon to have a cyclic rate of fire of around 850–950 rounds per minute.

==== M240D ====
The M240D is an upgrade of the M240E1, primarily in the addition of an optical rail on the receiver cover. It has two possible configurations: aircraft and egress (ground). In the aircraft configuration, the M240D has a front and rear sight and a trigger group which accommodates the spade grip device, while the ground configuration involves the installation of an egress package or &quot;infantry modification kit&quot;, which is designed to provide downed aircrew personnel with increased firepower. The egress package contains a buttstock assembly, a buffer assembly, a bipod assembly, and a conventional trigger assembly.

The barrel assembly contains a three position gas regulator. The first setting allows the weapon to cycle at 650–750 rounds per minute, the second gas setting allows the weapon to cycle at 750–850 rounds per minute, and the third setting allows the weapon to cycle at 850–950 rounds per minute.

The aircraft configured M240D weighs 25.6 lb (11.6 kg) and is 42.3 in (1,074.42 mm) long, whilst the egress configuration weighs 26.2 lb (11.9 kg) and is 49 in (1244.6 mm) long.

==== M240H ====
The M240H (formerly designated as the M240E5) is an improvement of the M240D, the M240H features a rail-equipped feed cover, an improved flash suppressor, and has been configured so that it can be more quickly converted to infantry standard using an Egress Kit. The M240H has an overall length of 41.6 in (1056.6 mm) with a 21.7 in (551.2 mm) barrel and weighs empty, and has a cyclic rate of fire of around 550–650 rounds per minute. The M240H entered service in 2004 on U.S. Army helicopters. It is equipped with dual spade grips and thumb-activated trigger systems, and can be quickly converted for dismounted infantry use via an egress components kit that includes a bipod and conventional pistol grip trigger module.

===M240G===

The M240G allows for commonality throughout the Marine Corps whether the weapon is used in an infantry, vehicular, or airborne role. The M240G is the ground version of the original M240 or M240E1, 7.62 mm medium class weapon designed as a coaxial/pintle-mounted machine gun for tanks and LAVs. The M240G can be modified for ground use by the installation of an &quot;infantry modification kit&quot; (a flash suppressor, front sight, carrying handle for the barrel, a buttstock, infantry length pistol grip, bipod, and rear sight assembly). The M240G lacks a front heat guard, and as such is a few pounds lighter than the M240B, weighing in at . The rate of fire of the M240G can be controlled by three gas settings. On gas setting one the weapon will fire at 650–750 rounds per minute, on gas setting two the weapon will fire at 750–850 rounds per minute, and on gas setting three the weapon will fire at 850–950 rounds per minute. The size of the gas port increases resulting in greater energy being delivered to the action. Use at high settings induces added stresses on the action and results in a shorter service life of the weapon. It gives the operator an ability to adjust the gas bleed to the action. This also allows the weapon to continue firing when very dirty from sustained use in combat conditions when it may be otherwise rendered inoperable due to an extremely dirty and dry action.

==== M240N ====
The M240N is designed with a front and rear sights, and configured specifically for mounting on watercraft. It is similar to the M240G, but lacks the integral bipod. It also uses the hydraulic buffer of the M240B, and features the lower cyclic rate of fire of the M240B which is around 550–650 rounds per minute.

===M240B===

The M240B (formerly called as the M240E4) is the standard infantry medium machine gun of the U.S. Marine Corps. The U.S. Navy and Coast Guard likewise utilize the weapon system, and is also still used by some units in the U.S. Army. It comes configured for ground combat with a buttstock and bipod, though it can also be mounted on tripod, ground vehicles, aircraft, aboard ships, and small boats. It is almost always referred to as the &quot;M240 Bravo&quot; or just &quot;240&quot; verbally.

The M60E4 (Mk 43 as designated by the Navy) was pitted against the M240E4 (former designation of the M240B) in the Army trials during the 1990s for a new infantry medium machine gun, in a competition to replace the decades-old M60s. The M240E4 won, and was then classified as the &quot;M240B&quot;. This led to 1,000 existing M240s being sent to FN for an overhaul and a special kit that modified them for use on ground (such as a stock, rail systems, etc.). This led to procurement contracts in the late 1990s for the all-new M240B. However, a new feature was added, a hydraulic buffer system to reduce the felt recoil as incorporated in the M60. While the M240B had been more reliable in the tests, it was a few pounds heavier than the M60E4, which led to the development of the lighter M240L. The Army M240 converted to the M240B configuration should not be confused with the large numbers of M240/E1 converted to the M240G configuration for the Marine Corps.
The main differences between the M240B and M240G is the Picatinny rail system, hydraulic buffer inside of the butt stock to reduce the amount of recoil felt by the gunner, and the number of gas settings on the gas regulator plug. The M240G has three gas settings, allowing the machine gun to have a fire rate between 650 and 750 rounds per minute when set to the first gas setting, 750–850 rounds per minute at the second gas setting, and 850–950 rounds per minute at the third gas setting, whereas the M240B only has one setting, restricting the fire rate to between 550 and 650 rounds per minute. The smaller gas port used on the M240B slows down the rate of fire, which increases the longevity of the machine gun by reducing stresses on the action. A side effect is a weapon that will not fire when extremely dirty as the energy on the piston is reduced.

The M240B is being tested with a new adjustable buttstock that may replace the current stock of the M240B. The lighter M240L has started to replace the M240B in U.S. Army service. The Marine Corps is observing the progress of the M240L, but feels it is too expensive for adoption. The Corps is instead looking to upgrade the M240 barrel through several ways, including carbon fiber coatings, new alloys, or ceramic liners, to lighten and strengthen the barrel. The goal would be a barrel that would not need to be changed, would weigh the same, but decrease heat retention, lessen warping, and eliminate cook-offs. They are also interested in incorporating a suppressor into the barrel, rather than having to attach one, to reduce the sound of shots and make it difficult to determine where the gunner is located.

===M240L===

The M240L (M240 Lima), formerly the M240E6 is the product of the M240B weight reduction program which reduces the weight of the existing M240B by . To achieve 18% weight savings, the M240L incorporates titanium construction and alternative manufacturing methods for fabricating major components. The resulting improvements reduced the soldier&#x27;s combat load while allowing easier handling and movement of the weapon. The M240L may replace the M240B in U.S. Army service. It was type classified in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.

Titanium was used to make the receiver body, front sight post, and carrying handle while maintaining steel operating system components. Manufacture had to be adjusted because titanium takes longer to machine than steel and requires more frequent replacement of tooling bits; more pliable stainless steel rivets were used, and the receiver was coated with boron and chrome carbo-nitride coatings with a ceramic-based top coat to preserve it under extreme operating temperatures. The M240L weighs with a standard-length barrel and standard stock, and weighs with a shorter barrel and collapsible stock. The short barrel is shorter than a standard M240 barrel, and with the collapsible stock the M240L can be made shorter. The smaller and lighter variant of the M240L is the M240P. The M240P is not used as often as its predecessors. The Army initially bought 4,500 M240Ls, and plans to buy 12,000 total.

=== Barrett 240 ===
The Barrett 240 Light Weight Program has its design roots in the original U.S. Army solicitation for a lighter M240 medium machine gun in 2010. The program called for a much lighter version of the M240, while keeping the same open bolt design. This was formally known as the M240B Weight Reduction Program, or the M240E6. The results of that solicitation ended with the adoption of the M240L by the U.S. Army. By producing the receiver out of titanium, instead of steel, FN delivered a light-weight solution by trimming the weight of the M240B by 5.5 pounds, or an 18 percent weight reduction of the original machine gun, giving it an overall weight of 22.3 pounds. The Lima is in limited service with the U.S. Army.

Although Barrett did not participate in the solicitation program, the company felt that it could produce an equivalent weight reduction by more efficient manufacturing methods instead of simply switching to the much more expensive titanium receiver. In addition, the company makes the point that the majority of worldwide titanium reserves are coming from Russia and China. Should relations between the United States and these countries sour, it would become much harder to find sources of titanium. Thus Barrett designed the 240LW and 240LWS, keeping the standard M240 technical data package, while more efficiently manufacturing the receiver.

In 2020, Geissele Automatics announced the acquisition of the technical data packages and intellectual property for the 240LW and 240LWS.

==== 240LW ====
The Barrett 240LW (Light Weight) is a general-purpose machine gun capable of mounting on a bipod, tripod, aircraft, or vehicle. It is belt fed, air-cooled, gas operated, fully automatic and fires from an open bolt. It features an adjustable buttstock with a hydraulic buffer, feed pawls, a fluted quick detach barrel, a new handguard with Keymod attachments, a new quick detach titanium bipod, adjustable carrying handle, a rivetless receiver, and a three position gas regulator.

==== 240LWS ====
The Barrett 240LWS (Light Weight Short) gas operated, belt fed, open bolt, medium machine gun is a shortened variant of the 240LW. The design concept of this variant is to produce a viable medium machine gun that would serve in a special operations capacity, where a small team of operators could maximize a medium machine gun by having it in a shorter and lighter package than its big brother, the 240LW, or the equivalent M240B. This follows in the footsteps of the Mk 48 and the M60E6 medium machine guns, also designed for the small unit role. The Mk 48 is a variant of the M249 light machine gun, scaled up to chamber 7.62×51mm NATO; it has come across some issues in its service life; it was never designed to be a general-purpose machine gun, while the M60E6 arguably came too late to make a difference in USMC and US Army general machine gun adoption, being that the M240 design was already well standardized within the Department of Defense ranks. Both offerings are more focused on Special Operations in US Service.

The Barrett 240LWS features a removable and telescoping buttstock that has six adjustable positions. It differs from the buttstock of the 240LW by being half of its size in length, and doesn&#x27;t have a polymer cheek piece. There are two telescoping rods that allow the buttstock to be extended to the desired position when depressed from the top portion. The rods have indentations on them, which lock into positional latches within the rear of the buttstock. The hydraulic buffer is permanently encased within the stock and is necessary for recoil reduction from the reciprocating movement of the bolt group. Early prototypes had steel QD sling sockets on both sides of the stock; however, current production versions will have solid steel sling loops on either side. This is to alleviate any damage that may occur to a sling that is mounted on the QD socket, and to reduce the amount of stress taken while carrying the machine gun. It also features a Picatinny rail that is longer compared to the Picatinny rail of the M240 machine guns, where the Barrett M107A1 rear sight can be mounted, along with other various optics. The design of the feed tray cover hinge has been altered to be in the shape of a hexagon, thus allowing for the feed tray cover to be able to stay open while at a 45-degree angle to the receiver while the machine gunner is loading a belt of ammunition. The feed tray has also been altered, with two protruding spring-loaded teeth which can bend in the direction of the ammunition belt. These teeth allow the operator to securely place a belt of ammunition on the feed tray while it is at an upright angle, and not have the belt slip out while closing the cover. In addition they allow the operator to be able to squeeze the front of the belt into a closed cover because the teeth only bend in the direction of the belt; the belt will pass over them, then the teeth will click upwards, thus locking the belt in place. Another click forward, and the belt of ammunition will be in place to fire. This allows the operator to feed a belt of ammunition into his 240LWS without ever having to expose his position or line of sight, when opening the feed tray cover.

The position of the pistol grip and firing control group has been redesigned to make the 240LWS even shorter than the 240LW. With this, Barrett moved the entire grip forward by about four inches, to where the front of the trigger guard is at a right angle to the ejection port. By moving the fire control group forward, the overall length could be shortened because the machine gunner no longer needs the traditionally longer stock to compensate for the original position of the pistol group, which is towards the very rear portion of the receiver. Instead of the operator using a cheek weld on the stock, the operator can now rest his face against the actual receiver of the machine gun; it also allows the operator to have a closer fit of the weapon. But to do this, the bolt had to be modified accordingly, because the sear has been moved from its original location. Barrett had to move the position of the sear catch on the bolt to further down on its length. The bolt group is still the same as the original M240 design, with the exception of the position of the sear catch. Though moving the grip forward took away the ability to connect the LWS to the standard pintle adapter from the M192 Lightweight Ground Mount, Barrett made available as part of the system a new adjustable pintle adapter that works with both that are made by Military Systems Group. As of July 2017, it is not yet clear if that adapter is compatible with the M192 or M122 Traverse and Elevation (T&amp;E) mechanism. However, the primary intended use of the LWS is not to be mounted, but instead to be part of a small team that needs additional firepower while on a foot patrol.

It still features a non-reciprocating bolt handle, a fluted quick detachable barrel and features a quick flip-up sight, a three-position gas regulator similar to the M240G&#x27;s gas regulator, a standard M240 muzzle compensator, a quick-detach titanium bipod that has three positions, and a new redesigned handguard which no longer touches the gas tube, minimizing heat transfer to the handguard. Unlike the current M240&#x27;s solution of minimizing the heat transfer, Barrett uses a free floating handguard system, where they bolted the handguard directly to the receiver of the machine gun, instead of to the gas tube assembly. The handguard also has Keymod rail sections at the 3, 6, and 9 o&#x27;clock positions, with the side sections being separated from the bottom by a gripping surface for the operator.

=== Ohio Ordnance Works 240 ===
==== OOW240 GPMG ====
The OOW240 GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun) is similar to the FN M240 but with a select fire trigger group, which is capable of semi-automatic and fully automatic fire. Ohio Ordnance Works also sells the same select fire trigger group separately and is compatible with the FN M240 and other FN MAG variants.

==== OOW240P ====
The OO240P (Patrol) is similar to the GPMG variant but with a shorter barrel. The shorter barrel features dimpling which reduces weight while increasing heat dissipation with no loss of strength or durability. The barrels are available with either single or three position gas regulators and are fully compatible with existing blank fire adaptors.

==== M240-SLR ====
The M240-SLR (Self-Loading Rifle) is a semi-automatic only configuration of the M240, and fires from a closed-bolt.

<doc id="616237" wikidata="Q11812551" url="?curid=616237" title="Swabia">
<text>Swabia is a cultural, historic and linguistic region in southwestern Germany. 
The name is ultimately derived from the medieval Duchy of Swabia, one of the German stem duchies, representing the historic settlement area of the Germanic tribe alliances named Alemanni and Suebi.

This territory would include all of the Alemannic German area, but the modern concept of Swabia is more restricted, due to the collapse of the duchy of Swabia in the thirteenth century. Swabia as understood in modern ethnography roughly coincides with the Swabian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire as it stood during the early modern period, now divided between the states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg.

Swabians (&quot;Schwaben&quot;, singular &quot;Schwabe&quot;) are the natives of Swabia and speakers of Swabian German. Their number was estimated at close to 0.8 million by SIL Ethnologue as of 2006, compared to a total population of 7.5 million in the regions of Tübingen, Stuttgart and Bavarian Swabia.

==Geography==
Like many cultural regions of Europe, Swabia&#x27;s borders are not clearly defined. However, today it is normally thought of as comprising the former Swabian Circle, or equivalently the former state of Württemberg (with the Prussian Hohenzollern Province), or the modern districts of Tübingen (excluding the former Baden regions of the Bodenseekreis district), Stuttgart, and the administrative region of Bavarian Swabia.

In the Middle Ages, the term Swabia indicated a larger area, covering all the lands associated with the Frankish stem duchy of Alamannia stretching from the Vosges Mountains in the west to the broad Lech river in the east: 

==History==

===Early history===

Like all of Southern Germany, what is now Swabia was part of the La Tène culture, and as such has a Celtic (Gaulish) substrate. In the Roman era, it was part of the Raetia province.

The name &quot;Suebia&quot; is derived from that of the &quot;Suebi&quot;.
It is used already by Tacitus in the 1st century, albeit in a different geographical sense:
He calls the Baltic Sea the &quot;Mare Suevicum&quot; (&quot;Suebian Sea&quot;) after the Suiones, and ends his description of the Suiones and Sitones with &quot;Here Suebia ends&quot; (&quot;Hic Suebiae finis&quot;).
By the mid-3rd century, groups of the Suebi form the core element of the new tribal alliance known as the Alamanni, who expanded towards the Roman Limes east of the Rhine and south of the Main.
The Alamanni were sometimes referred to as Suebi even at this time, and their new area of settlement came to be known as Suebia.
In the migration period, the Suebi (Alamanni) crossed the Rhine in 406 and some of them established the Kingdom of the Suebi in Galicia. Another group settled in parts of Pannonia, after the Huns were defeated in 454 in the Battle of Nedao.

The Alemanni were ruled by independent kings throughout the 4th to 5th centuries but fell under Frankish domination in the 6th (Battle of Tolbiac 496).
By the late 5th century, the area settled by the Alemanni extended to Alsace and the Swiss Plateau, bordering on the Bavarii to the east, the Franks to the north, the remnants of Roman Gaul to the west, and the Lombards and Goths, united in the Kingdom of Odoacer, to the south.

The name &quot;Alamannia&quot; was used by the 8th century, and from the 9th century, &quot;Suebia&quot; was occasionally used for &quot;Alamannia&quot;, while &quot;Alamannia&quot; was increasingly used to refer to Alsace specifically. By the 12th century, &quot;Suebia&quot; rather than &quot;Alamannia&quot; was used consistently for the territory of the Duchy of Swabia.

===Duchy of Swabia===

Swabia was one of the original stem duchies of East Francia, the later Holy Roman Empire, as it developed in the 9th and 10th centuries. Due to the foundation of the important abbeys of St. Gallen and Reichenau, Swabia became an important center of Old High German literary culture during this period.

In the later Carolingian period, Swabia became once again de facto independent, by the early 10th century mostly ruled by two dynasties, the Hunfriding counts in Raetia Curiensis and the Ahalolfings ruling the Baar estates around the upper Neckar and Danube rivers. 
The conflict between the two dynasties was decided in favour of Hunfriding Burchard II at the Battle of Winterthur (919). Burchard&#x27;s rule as duke was acknowledged as such by the newly elected king Henry the Fowler, and in the 960s the duchy under Burchard III was incorporated in the Holy Roman Empire under Otto I.

The Hohenstaufen dynasty, which ruled the Holy Roman Empire in the 12th and 13th centuries, arose out of Swabia, but following the execution of Conradin, the last Hohenstaufen, on 29 October 1268, the duchy was not reappointed during the Great Interregnum. In the following years, the original duchy gradually broke up into many smaller units.

Rudolf I of Habsburg, elected in 1273 as emperor, tried to restore the duchy, but met the opposition of the higher nobility who aimed to limit the power of the emperor. Instead, he confiscated the former estates of the Hohenstaufen as imperial property of the Holy Roman Empire, and declared most of the cities formerly belonging to Hohenstaufen to be Free Imperial Cities, and the more powerful abbeys within the former duchy to be Imperial Abbeys.

The rural regions were merged into the Imperial Shrievalty (&quot;Reichslandvogtei&quot;) of Swabia, which was given as Imperial Pawn to Duke Leopold III of Austria in 1379 and again to Sigismund, Archduke of Austria, in 1473/1486. He took the title of a &quot;Prince of Swabia&quot; and integrated the Shrievalty of Swabia in the realm of Further Austria.

===Later medieval period===

The Swabian League of Cities was first formed on 20 November 1331, when twenty-two imperial cities of the former Duchy of Swabia banded together in support of the Emperor Louis IV, who in return promised not to mortgage any of them to any imperial vassal. Among the founding cities were Augsburg, Heilbronn, Reutlingen, and Ulm. The counts of Württemberg, Oettingen, and Hohenberg were induced to join in 1340.

The defeat of the city league by Count Eberhard II of Württemberg in 1372
led to the formation of a new league of fourteen Swabian cities on 4 July 1376.
The emperor refused to recognise the newly revitalised Swabian League, seeing it as a rebellion, and this led to an &quot;imperial war&quot; against the league. The renewed league defeated an imperial army at the Battle of Reutlingen on 14 May 1377.
Burgrave Frederick V of Hohenzollern finally defeated the league in 1388 at Döffingen. The next year the city league disbanded according to the resolutions of the Reichstag at Eger.

The major dynasties that arose out of medieval Swabia were the Habsburgs and the Hohenzollerns, who rose to prominence in Northern Germany. Also stemming from Swabia are the local dynasties of the dukes of Württemberg and the margraves of Baden. The Welf family went on to rule in Bavaria and Hanover, and are ancestral to the British Royal Family that has ruled since 1714. Smaller feudal dynasties eventually disappeared, however; for example, branches of the Montforts and Hohenems lived until modern times, and the Fürstenberg survive still. The region proved to be one of the most divided in the empire, containing, in addition to these principalities, numerous free cities, ecclesiastical territories, and fiefdoms of lesser counts and knights.

===Early modern history===

A new Swabian League (&quot;Schwäbischer Bund&quot;) was formed in 1488, opposing the expansionist Bavarian dukes from the House of Wittelsbach and the revolutionary threat from the south in the form of the Swiss.
In 1519, the League conquered Württemberg and sold it to Charles V after its duke Ulrich seized the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen during the interregnum that followed the death of Maximilian I. It helped to suppress the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1524–26 and defeat an alliance of robber barons in the Franconian War. The Reformation caused the league to be disbanded in 1534.

The territory of Swabia as understood today emerges in the early modern period. It corresponds to the Swabian Circle established in 1512.
The Old Swiss Confederacy was &quot;de facto&quot; independent from Swabia from 1499 as a result of the Swabian War, while the Margraviate of Baden had been detached from Swabia since the twelfth century.

Fearing the power of the greater princes, the cities and smaller secular rulers of Swabia joined to form the Swabian League in the fifteenth century. The League was quite successful, notably expelling the Duke of Württemberg in 1519 and putting in his place a Habsburg governor, but the league broke up a few years later over religious differences inspired by the Reformation, and the Duke of Württemberg was soon restored.

The region was quite divided by the Reformation. While secular princes such as the Duke of Württemberg and the Margrave of Baden-Durlach, as well as most of the Free Cities, became Protestant, the ecclesiastical territories (including the bishoprics of Augsburg, Konstanz and the numerous Imperial abbeys) remained Catholic, as did the territories belonging to the Habsburgs (Further Austria), the Sigmaringen branch of the House of Hohenzollern, and the Margrave of Baden-Baden.

===Modern history===
In the wake of the territorial reorganization of the empire of 1803 by the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot;, the shape of Swabia was entirely changed. All the ecclesiastical estates were secularized, and most of the smaller secular states, and almost all of the free cities, were mediatized, leaving only the Kingdom of Württemberg, the Grand Duchy of Baden, and the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen as sovereign states. Much of Eastern Swabia became part of Bavaria, forming what is now the Swabian administrative region of Bavaria. The Kings of Bavaria assumed the title &quot;Duke in Swabia&quot;, with the &quot;in&quot; indicating that only parts of the Swabian territory was ruled by them, unlike their other title &quot;Duke of Franconia&quot; which made clear that the whole of Franconia had become part of their kingdom. 

In contemporary usage, &quot;Schwaben&quot; is sometimes taken to refer to Bavarian Swabia exclusively, correctly however it includes the larger Württemberg part of Swabia. Its inhabitants attach great importance to calling themselves Swabians. Baden, historically part of the duchy of Swabia and also of the Swabian Circle, is no longer commonly included in the term. Baden&#x27;s residents mostly refer to themselves as 
Alemanni (versus the Swabians).

==Swabian people==
=== Language ===

SIL Ethnologue cites an estimate of 819,000 Swabian speakers as of 2006. This corresponds to roughly 10% of the total population of the Swabian region, or roughly 1% of the total population of Germany.

As an ethno-linguistic group, Swabians are closely related to other speakers of Alemannic German, i.e. Badeners, Alsatians, and German-speaking Swiss.

Swabian German is traditionally spoken in the upper Neckar basin (upstream of Heilbronn), along the upper Danube between Tuttlingen and Donauwörth, in Upper Swabia, and on the left bank of the Lech, in an area centered on the Swabian Alps roughly stretching from Stuttgart to Augsburg.

Many Swabian surnames end with the suffixes &quot;-le&quot;, &quot;-(l)er&quot;, &quot;-el&quot;, &quot;-ehl&quot;, and &quot;-lin&quot;, typically from the Middle High German diminutive suffix &quot;-elîn&quot; (Modern Standard German &quot;-lein&quot;). Examples would be: &quot;Schäuble&quot;, &quot;Egeler&quot;, &quot;Rommel&quot;, and &quot;Gmelin&quot;. The popular German surname &quot;Schwab&quot; as well as &quot;Svevo&quot; in Italy are derived from this area, both meaning literally &quot;Swabian&quot;.

<text>The South Shetland Islands are a group of Antarctic islands located in the Drake Passage with a total area of . They lie about north of the Antarctic Peninsula, and between southwest of the nearest point of the South Orkney Islands. By the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, the islands&#x27; sovereignty is neither recognized nor disputed by the signatories and they are free for use by any signatory for non-military purposes.

The islands have been claimed by the United Kingdom since 1908 and as part of the British Antarctic Territory since 1962. They are also claimed by the governments of Chile (since 1940, as part of the Antártica Chilena province), and by Argentina (since 1943, as part of Argentine Antarctica, Tierra del Fuego Province).

Several countries maintain research stations on the islands. Most of them are situated on King George Island, benefitting from the airfield of the Chilean base Eduardo Frei.

Sixteen research stations are in different parts of the islands, with Chilean stations being the greatest in number.

== History ==
The islands were discovered by British mariner William Smith, in , in 1819. Although Dutch mariner Dirck Gerritsz in 1599 or Spanish Admiral Gabriel de Castilla in 1603 might have sighted the South Shetlands, or North or South American sealers might have visited the archipelago before Smith, historical evidence is insufficient to sustain such assertions. Smith&#x27;s discovery, by contrast, was well documented and had wider historical implications beyond its geographic significance.

Chilean scientists have claimed that Amerinds visited the islands, due to stone artifacts recovered from bottom-sampling operations in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, and Discovery Bay, Greenwich Island; however, the artifacts – two arrowheads – were later found to have been planted. In 1818, Juan Pedro de Aguirre obtained permission from the Buenos Aires authorities to establish a base for sealing on &quot;some of the uninhabited islands near the South Pole&quot;.

Captain William Smith in the British merchant brig &quot;Williams&quot;, while sailing to Valparaíso, Chile, in 1819, deviated from his route south of Cape Horn, and on 19 February 1819 sighted Williams Point, the northeast extremity of Livingston Island. Thus, Livingston Island became the first land ever discovered farther than 60° south. Smith revisited the South Shetlands, landed on King George Island on 16 October 1819, and claimed possession for Britain.

Meanwhile, the Spanish Navy ship &quot;San Telmo&quot; sank in September 1819 whilst trying to go through the Drake Passage. Parts of her presumed wreckage were found months later by sealers on the north coast of Livingston Island. The crew of &quot;San Telmo&quot; and the troops onboard, led by Brigadier Rosendo Porlier (a total of 644 men), are believed to be the first known humans to land in Antarctica.

From December 1819 to January 1820, the islands were surveyed and mapped by Lieutenant Edward Bransfield on board the &quot;Williams&quot;, which had been chartered by the Royal Navy.

On 15 November 1819, the United States agent in Valparaíso, Jeremy Robinson, informed the United States Secretary of State John Quincy Adams of Smith&#x27;s discovery and Bransfield&#x27;s forthcoming mission, and suggested dispatching a United States Navy ship to explore the islands, where &quot;new sources of wealth, power, and happiness would be disclosed and science itself be benefited thereby&quot;.

The discovery of the islands attracted British and American sealers. The first sealing ship to operate in the area was the brig &quot;Espirito Santo&quot;, chartered by British merchants in Buenos Aires. The ship arrived at Rugged Island off Livingston Island, where its British crew landed on Christmas Day 1819, and claimed the islands for King George III. A narrative of the events was published by the brig&#x27;s master, Joseph Herring, in the July 1820 edition of the &quot;Imperial Magazine&quot;. The &quot;Espirito Santo&quot; was followed from the Falkland Islands by the American brig &quot;Hersilia&quot;, commanded by Captain James Sheffield (with second mate Nathaniel Palmer), the first US sealer in the South Shetlands.

The first wintering over in Antarctica took place on the South Shetlands, when at the end of the 1820–1821 summer season, 11 British men from the ship &quot;Lord Melville&quot; failed to leave King George Island, and survived the winter to be rescued at the beginning of the next season.

Having circumnavigated the Antarctic continent, the Russian Antarctic Expedition of Fabian von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev arrived at the South Shetlands in January 1821. The Russians surveyed the islands and named them, landing on both King George Island and Elephant Island. While sailing between Deception and Livingston Islands, Bellingshausen was visited by Nathaniel Palmer, master of the American brig &quot;Hero&quot;, who informed him of the activities of dozens of American and British sealing ships in the area.

The name &quot;New South Britain&quot; was used briefly, but was soon changed to South Shetland Islands (in reference to the Shetland Islands in the north of Scotland). The name South Shetland Islands is now established in international usage. The two island groups lie at similar distances from the Equator; the Scottish Shetland Islands are 60°N, and warmed by the Gulf Stream, but the South Shetlands at 62°S are much colder. 

Seal hunting and whaling were conducted on the islands during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The sealing era lasted from 1820 to 1908 during which time 197 vessels are recorded as having visiting the islands. Twelve of those vessels were wrecked. Relics of the sealing era include iron try pots, hut ruins, and inscriptions.

Beginning in 1908, the islands were governed as part of the Falkland Islands Dependency, but they have only been permanently occupied by humans since the establishment of a scientific research station in 1944. The archipelago, together with the nearby Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia Island, is an increasingly popular tourist destination during the southern summer.

== Geography ==
As a group of islands, the South Shetland Islands are located at . They are within the region 61° 00&#x27;–63° 37&#x27; South, 53° 83&#x27;–62° 83&#x27; West. The islands lie south of the Falkland Islands, and between (Deception Island) and (Clarence Island) northwest and north from the nearest point of the Antarctic continent, Graham Land.

The South Shetlands consist of 11 major islands and several minor ones, totalling of land area. Between 80 and 90% of the land area is permanently glaciated. The highest point on the island chain is Mount Foster on Smith Island at above sea level at 2-meter spatial resolution.

The South Shetland Islands extend about from Smith Island and Low Island in the west-southwest to Elephant Island and Clarence Island in the east-northeast.

=== Volcanoes ===
Various volcanoes with activity in the Quaternary exist in the islands. These volcanoes are associated with the tectonics of Bransfield Rift. From west to east, the known volcanoes are Sail Rock, Deception Island, Rezen Knoll, Gleaner Heights, Edinburgh Hill, Inott Point, Penguin Island, Melville Peak, and Bridgeman Island. Most of the volcanic rock and tephra is of basalt or basaltic andesite. An exception is the tephra of Deception Island, which is of trachyte and basaltic trachyandesite, richer in potassium and sodium.

Quaternary volcanic products of the islands tend to have less potassium and sodium at a given silica range, and lower Nb/Y ratios, than those associated with the Larsen Rift on the Antarctic Peninisula.

=== Climate ===
The islands are the same distance from the Equator as the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic, but their proximity to Antarctica means that they have a much colder climate. The sea around the islands is closed by ice from early April to early December, and the monthly average temperature is below for eight months of the year (April to November).

The islands have experienced measurable glacier retreat during recent years, but despite this, they remain more than 80% snow- and ice-covered throughout the summer.

The climate is cloudy and humid all year round, and very strong westerly winds blow at all seasons. Some of the sunniest weather is associated with outbreaks of very cold weather from the south in late winter and spring. Mean summer temperatures are only about and those in winter are about . The effect of the ocean tends to keep summer temperatures low and prevent winter temperatures from falling as low as they do inland to the south.

== Flora and fauna ==
Despite the harsh conditions, the islands do support vegetation and are part of the Scotia Sea Islands tundra ecoregion, along with South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orkney Islands, and Bouvet Island. All of these islands lie in the cold seas below the Antarctic Convergence. These areas support tundra vegetation consisting of mosses, lichens, and algae, while seabirds, penguins, and seals feed in the surrounding waters.

== In fiction ==
* The archipelago provides the &quot;mise-en-scène&quot; of the 2016 Antarctica thriller novel &quot;The Killing Ship&quot; authored by Elizabeth Cruwys and Beau Riffenburgh (under their joint alias Simon Beaufort), with action spreading from Hannah Point to Byers Peninsula via Ivanov Beach, skirting Verila Glacier and Rotch Dome in the process.
* &quot;Away with the Penguins&quot; by Hazel Prior (2020) is set in a penguin research base on the fictional island of &quot;Locket Island&quot;, but which the author states is based on the South Shetland Islands.

<doc id="616244" wikidata="Q5334945" url="?curid=616244" title="Ed Hinton (sportswriter)">
<text>Edward Talmage Hinton (July 21, 1948 – February 6, 2025) was an American motorsports columnist for ESPN.com.

==Life and career==
Hinton was born in Laurel, Mississippi. He attended the University of Mississippi and later the University of Southern Mississippi, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, graduating in 1970. He began working for the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; covering the NASCAR racing circuit. Hinton moved to Atlanta and married his wife, Snow, in 1983. In the late 1980s, Hinton joined the new sports daily newspaper, &quot;The National&quot;, which folded after only a few years. In 1988, he and his wife had their only child, Tyler.

In 1993 Hinton joined Dallas Cowboys football coach Jimmy Johnson and wrote &quot;Turning the Thing Around&quot;. Hinton was then hired as a senior writer for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

In May 1999, Hinton was involved in a controversy at &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; with the Indy Racing League. Three spectators were fatally injured after a tire went into the grandstands during a race at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway in North Carolina. The IRL deemed Hinton&#x27;s and &quot;SI&quot;&#x27;s coverage of the accident insensitive and inappropriate, and revoked Hinton&#x27;s credentials for the 1999 Indianapolis 500. In response, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Detroit News&quot; announced they were boycotting the race. A few days later, Hinton&#x27;s credentials were restored, and he reportedly attended.

In 1999, Hinton and his family moved to North Carolina, and in 2000, Hinton returned to the &quot;Sentinel&quot; and the Chicago Tribune newspaper chain.

On January 2, 2008, Hinton left the Sentinel and Chicago Tribune newspaper chain. On July 3, 2008, ESPN announced that it had hired Hinton as a senior writer for its digital platforms. Hinton announced his retirement on December 31, 2014.

Hinton died in Birmingham, Alabama, on February 6, 2025, at the age of 76.

==Death of Dale Earnhardt==

On February 18, 2001, NASCAR driver and long-time friend of Hinton, Dale Earnhardt, was killed on the final turn of the Daytona 500. Hinton and the &quot;Sentinel&quot; suspected that, like Kenny Irwin and Adam Petty, Earnhardt&#x27;s cause of death had been basilar skull fracture (Hinton had recently published a three-part series on the subject of NASCAR safety) and claimed that under Florida law, the state was legally required to turn over Earnhardt&#x27;s autopsy photographs. Teresa Earnhardt and others claimed the newspaper could not have access to the photographs, leading to a First Amendment legal battle which was finally concluded by an official NASCAR report on Earnhardt&#x27;s death.

<doc id="616245" wikidata="Q1157079" url="?curid=616245" title="Aram (region)">
<text>Aram (; ; ) was a historical region mentioned in early cuneiforms and in the Bible. The area did not develop into a larger empire but consisted of several small states in present-day Syria. Some of the states are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, Aram-Damascus being the most outstanding one, which came to encompass most of Syria. In the Bible, Aram-Damascus is simply commonly referred to as Aram.

After the final conquest by the rising Neo-Assyrian Empire in the second half of the 8th century and also during the later consecutive rules of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (612–539 BCE) and the Achaemenid Empire (539–332 BCE), the region of Aram lost most of its sovereignty. During the Seleucid period (312-64 BCE), the term &quot;Syria&quot; was introduced as Hellenistic designation for this region. By the beginning of the 5th century, that practice also started to affect terminology of Aramean ecclesiastical and literary elites, and &quot;Syrian&quot; labels started to gain frequency and acceptance not only in Aramean translations of Greek works, but also in original works of Aramean writers. 

Aramaic eventually replaced Akkadian as the lingua franca of the entire region and became the administrative and commercial language of several empires such as the Achaemenid Empire and the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Early on, the Christian Bible was translated into Aramaic, and by the 4th century the local Aramaic dialect of Edessa (&quot;Urhay&quot;) developed into a literary language, known as Edessan Aramaic (&quot;Urhaya&quot;) or more commonly as Syriac.

== Etymology ==

The choronym of the name Aram refers to the geographical region in which they lived and means &quot;High(landers)&quot;. The toponym &quot;A-ra-mu&quot; appears in an inscription at the East Semitic speaking kingdom of Ebla listing geographical names, and the term &quot;Armi&quot;, which is the Eblaite term for nearby Idlib, occurs frequently in the Ebla tablets (c. 2300 BCE). One of the annals of Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2250 BCE) mentions that he captured &quot;Dubul, the ensí of &quot;A-ra-me&quot;&quot; (&quot;Arame&quot; is seemingly a genitive form), in the course of a campaign against Simurrum in the northern mountains. Other early references to a place or people of &quot;Aram&quot; have appeared at the archives of Mari (c. 1900 BCE) and at Ugarit (c. 1300 BCE). The terms &quot;Aram&quot; and &quot;Aramean&quot; frequently occur in the letters of a governor&#x27;s archive from Nippur. The written text informed about farmers from &quot;Bīt-Aram&quot; referring to the region of Aram.

The word &quot;Aḫlamū&quot; was attested since the Old Babylonian period, first as a designation for the Amorites and later for the Arameans. In the Assyrian royal inscriptions the term &quot;Aḫlamū&quot; and the name &quot;A-ra-mu&quot; are sometimes combined to form a double designation for Arameans. 
Early Jewish tradition claims that the name is derived from the biblical Aram, son of Shem, a grandson of Noah in the Bible.

== History ==

The Arameans appear to have displaced the earlier Semitic Amorite (Aḫlamū) populations of ancient Syria during the period from 1100 BC to 900 BC, which was a Dark Age for the entire Near East, North Africa, Caucasus, Mediterranean regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people. The early history of the Arameans is tied to that of the &quot;Aḫlamū&quot; and &quot;Sutû&quot; who were already known in the Late Bronze Age and who seem to have played a role in the period&#x27;s demise. The Arameans rose to be the prominent group amongst the Ahlamu, and from c. 1200 BC on, the Amorites disappeared from the pages of history and the term Ahlamu underwent a semantic shift, becoming an accepted term for &quot;Aramean&quot;. From then on, the region that they had inhabited became known as Aram and Eber-Nari.

The Arameans emerged in a region which was largely under the domination of the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1050 BC) and quickly posed a threat to the Assyrian polity which was largely located west of the Euphrates. In order to nullify this threat, Tiglath-Pileser I (1115–1077 BC) of Assyria performed many campaigns in Aramean territory, although the numerous campaigns that the Assyrian records recorded that he took indicate that Assyrian military campaigns were unsuccessful at exercising power or dominance over the Arameans. Some scholars believe that the Arameans took Nineveh in this time. In the 11th century BC, Assyria fell into decline which may have been caused by the incursions of the emerging Arameans, allowing the Arameans to establish a string of states across the Levant and make notable expansions into Assyrian territory in this time such as in the Khabur Valley. During the period 1050 – 900 BC Arameans came to dominate most of what is now Syria but was then called Eber-Nari and Aramea.

Two medium-sized Aramaean kingdoms, Aram-Damascus and Hamath, along with several smaller kingdoms and independent city-states, developed in the region during the early first millennium BCE. The most notable of these were Bit Adini, Bit Bahiani, Bit Hadipe, Aram-Rehob, Aram-Zobah, Bit-Zamani, Bit-Halupe and Aram-Ma&#x27;akah, as well as the Aramean tribal polities of the Gambulu, Litau and Puqudu.

There was some synthesis with neo Hittite populations in northern Syria and south central Anatolia, and a number of small so called Syro-Hittite states arose in the region, such as Tabal. The east Mediterranean coast was largely dominated by Phoenician city states such as Tyre, Sidon, Berytus and Arvad.

With the advent of the Neo Assyrian Empire, the region was invaded on several occasions, since the middle of the 9th century, and finally fell under the control of Assyrian kings during the second half of the 8th century BCE. Large numbers of people living in the region were deported into Assyria, Babylonia and elsewhere. A few &quot;steles&quot; that name kings of this period have been found, such as the 8th-century Zakkur stele. The Assyrians and Babylonians themselves adopted a Mesopotamian form of Aramaic, known as Imperial Aramaic in the 8th century BC, when Tiglath-pileser III made it the lingua franca of his vast empire. The Neo Aramaic dialects still spoken by the indigenous Assyrians and Mandeans of northern Iraq, south east Turkey, north east Syria and north west Iran, descend from this language.

The Neo Assyrian Empire was riven by unremitting civil war from 626 BC onward, weakening it severely, and allowing it to be attacked and destroyed by a coalition of its former vassals between 616 and 605 BCE. The region of Aram was subsequently fought over by the Neo-Babylonian Empire and Egyptians, the latter of whom had belatedly come to the aid of their former Assyrian overlords. The Babylonians prevailed and Aram became a part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (612–539 BC) where it remained named Eber-Nari.

The Persian Achaemenid Empire (539–332 BC) overthrew the Babylonians and conquered the region. They retained the Imperial Aramaic introduced by the Assyrians, and the name of Eber-Nari.

In 332 BC the region was conquered by the Greek ruler, Alexander the Great. Upon his death in 323 BC this area became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire, at which point Greek replaced the Assyrian introduced Imperial Aramaic as the official language of Empire, as were the names Eber-Nari and Aramea. This area and other parts of the former Assyrian Empire to the east (including Assyria itself) were renamed Syria (Seleucid Syria), a 9th-century BC Hurrian, Luwian and Greek corruption of Assyria (see Etymology of Syria and Name of Syria), which had for centuries until this point referred specifically to the land of Assyria and the Assyrians, which in modern terms actually covered the northern half of Iraq, north east Syria, south east Turkey and the north western fringes of Iran, and not the bulk of &quot;modern Syria&quot; and Lebanon and its largely Aramean and Phoenician inhabitants.

It is from this period that the later &quot;Syria vs Assyria&quot; naming controversy arises, the Seleucids confusingly applied the name not only to the Mesopotamian land of Assyria itself, but also to the lands west of Euphrates which had never been part of Assyria itself, but merely Aramean, Phoenician, Neo-Hittite and Sutean inhabited colonies. When they lost control of Assyria itself to the Parthians, the name &quot;Syria&quot; survived but was dislocated from its original source, and was applied only to the land west of Euphrates that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, while Assyria-proper went back to being called Assyria (and also Athura/Assuristan). However, this situation led to both Assyrians and Arameans being dubbed &quot;Syrians&quot; and later &quot;Syriacs&quot; in Greco-Roman culture.

This area, by now called &quot;Syria&quot;, was fought over by Seleucids and Parthians during the 2nd century BCE, and later still by the Romans and Sassanid Persians. Palmyra, a powerful Aramean kingdom arose during this period,
and for a time it dominated the area and successfully resisted Roman and Persian attempts at conquest. The region eventually came under the control of the Byzantine Empire. Christianity began to take hold from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD, and the Aramaic language gradually supplanted Canaanite in Phoenecia and Hebrew in Palestine.

In the mid-7th century AD the region fell to the Arab Islamic conquest. Aramaic survived among a sizable portion of the population of Syria, who resisted &quot;Arabization&quot;. However, the native Western Aramaic of the Aramean Christian population of Syria is spoken today by only a few thousand people, the majority having now adopted the Arabic language. Mesopotamian Eastern Aramaic, which still contains a number of loanwords from the Akkadian, as well as structural similarities, still survives among the majority of ethnically distinct Assyrians, who are mainly based in northern Iraq, north-eastern Syria, south-eastern Turkey and north-western Iran.

==Culture==
After the fall of the last Aramean kingdoms and city-states the Arameans isolated themselves mainly in Northern Mesopotamia and continued to maintain their culture and identity under Muslim rule till this day. Over one hundred dialects of Aramaic were spoken in the Middle East in the first half of the twentieth century by Arameans and smaller groups of Jews, Mandeans and Muslims.

===Religion===
====Ancient Aramean Religion====
Records of the religion and worship habits among ancient Arameans are fairly scarce. The Aramean pagan pantheon mainly consisted of common Semitic gods who were also worshipped by other Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples kin to the Arameans. Their greatest god was Hadad, the god of thunderstorms and fertility. He was also known as Ramman meaning “thunderer.” Another widespread name for this deity in Aramaic was Rahmana (“merciful”). In the inscriptions left by Aramean kings this god is often referred to as their protector. Hadad was usually depicted as a bearded soldier striking with thunder or holding a double-edged sword in his hand. The bull was the symbolic animal of Hadad on which he often depicted as standing on the bull’s back. The bull’s head that symbolizes Hadad can be seen on coins dating back to the 4th century BC, which were unearthed nearby the ancient Aramean city of Mabbug, which the Greeks called Hierapolis (“sacred city”). The main temple built in Hadad’s name was located in Aram-Damascus. The fate of this temple is remarkable, under the Roman Empire it was rebuilt as a Temple of Jupiter, during Byzantine times it was turned into a church and after the Arab conquest of Syria it became the biggest mosque of modern day Syria, named Umayyad Mosque. The name Bar-Hadad, which several Aramean kings bore, literally means &quot;son of Hadad&quot;. It was a royal title, so no one else had the right to be called by that name. Eventually the name lost its distinction, and despite its pagan origins, the Arameans preserved the name after the adoption of Christianity. After the Arameans became christianized there even was a bishop called Bar-Hadad. 

It appears from their inscriptions as well as from their names that the Arameans also worshipped other Mesopotamian gods such as Sin, Ishtar (whom they called Astarte), Shamash, Tammuz, Bel and Nergal, but also some Canaanite-Phoenician deities such as the storm-god, El, the supreme deity of Canaan, in addition to Anat (‘Atta) and others.

===Language===
With the spread of the Arameans in large numbers throughout Mesopotamia and the Levant the Aramaic language became the lingua franca of the whole Middle-East. It has served as a language of public life and administration of ancient kingdoms and empires, and also as a language of divine worship and religious study. It subsequently branched into several Neo-Aramaic languages that are still spoken in modern times.

===Architecture and art===

Aramean cities were enclosed by a city wall and a fortified upper town or citadel on which palaces and other representative buildings are located. The entrance of the palaces of the kings mostly included several steles of winged bulls or lions as a sign of power and dominance. Surprisingly, no temples have been excavated on the citadels of the major Aramean cities. The only remarkable exception is the temple in antis in Tell Afis. The fact that the main temple of Sam&#x27;al was not located in the capital city but on the rocky hill called Gerçin about seven kilometers north of Zincirli may indicate different solutions in the use of religious spaces.

The Aramean kings showed a different headgear and stylization of hair and beard compared to other nations at that time. They distinguished themselves by their exclusive headgears, medium-length beards and large curved noses. Especially a braid hanging down in front of their headgear was a typical form of Aramean art.

<text>Palencia () is a city of Spain located in the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is the capital and most populated municipality of the province of Palencia.

Located in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, in the northern half of the Inner Plateau, the city lies on the left bank of the Carrión river.

At the regional level, Palencia forms part of an economic axis together with the cities of Valladolid and Burgos. As of 2017, the municipality has a population of 78,892.

== Geography ==

Palencia lies in the north of the central Spanish plateau, the Meseta Central, in the middle of the Carrión river valley, near the river&#x27;s confluence with the Pisuerga, which flows through the town creating four islets, Dos Aguas and Sotillo being the largest. Palencia is located approximately 190 km north of Madrid, and some 40 km north of Valladolid, capital of Castile and León.

Two hills surround the city in its north-east area. On the closest stands the 30-metre high statue of Christ known as the &quot;Cristo del Otero&quot;, the fourth-tallest statue of Christ in the world.

Palencia has a substantial forest of 6 km away on a plateau above the city, known locally as the &quot;Monte el Viejo&quot; (&quot;Old Mount&quot;). This park is a popular amusement area for the locals.

The Canal de Castilla runs close to the city.

Palencia&#x27;s municipality includes the village of Paredes de Monte, 14 km away.

== Climate ==
The region of Palencia has a Continental Mediterranean climate with cool winters, due to altitude (749 m) and isolation from maritime influences, chilly winds, including some days of snow in the winter and minimum temperatures usually below 0 °C (32 °F). Fog is frequent because of the Carrion river. Summers are hot with temperatures that consistently surpass 30 °C (86 °F) in July and that can rarely reach 38 °C (99 °F). Due to Palencia&#x27;s altitude, nightly temperatures tend to be cooler, leading to a lower average in the summer months. Precipitation levels are moderated, but precipitation can be observed throughout the year (except July and August). Summer and winter are the driest seasons, with most rainfall occurring in the autumn and spring.

Light rains are very frequent in winter, with infrequent rain and heavy thunderstorms in the summer. Snow is an infrequent occurrence, with only a few days of snowfall each year in December, January, and February, however, snowfall can also occur in November or March.
==History==

===Ancient era===
The fortified Celtiberian settlement is mentioned as Pallantia () by Strabo and Ptolemy, a possible derivation of an Indo-European root &quot;pala&quot; (&quot;plain&quot;). It was the chief town of the Vaccaei, although Strabo wrongly assigns it to the Arevaci. The city was starved into submission by the Romans in the 2nd century BC and incorporated into the province of Hispania Tarraconensis, in the jurisdiction of Colonia Clunia Sulpicia (modern Clunia). Though the little Roman garrison city was an active mint, it was insignificant compared to the Roman villas of Late Antiquity in the surrounding territory. Archeologists have uncovered the remains of Roman villas at La Olmeda and at the &quot;Quintanilla de la Cueza&quot;, where the fragments of mosaic floors are spectacularly refined. According to the 5th-century Galician chronicler Idatius, the city of Palencia was all but destroyed (457) in the Visigothic wars against the Suevi: the date falls in the reign of Theodoric II, whose power centre still lay far to the east, in Aquitania. When the Visigoths conquered the territory, however, they retained the Roman rural villa system in establishing the &quot;Campos Góticos&quot; (&quot;Gothic Fields&quot;).

===Bishopric===
The Catholic bishopric of Palencia was founded in the 3rd century or earlier, assuming that its bishop was among those assembled in the 3rd century to depose Basilides, bishop of Astorga. Priscillianism, which originated in Roman Egypt but flourished in Iberia was declared a heresy by the emperor Gratian. Prisciallinists held orthodox Catholic beliefs with Gnostic/Montanist influences. Priscillian was ordained priest and then consecrated bishop of Ávila. The &#x27;heresy&#x27; was strongest in northwestern Spain. The declaration of heresy was a political move by the Catholic usurper emperor Maximus (383-388) to curry favor with the Catholic emperors Valentinian II and Theodosius I (a Spaniard). After the establishment of effective Visigothic power Catholics disputed the bishopric of Palencia with the Arian Visigoths. Maurila, an Arian bishop established in Palencia by Leovigild, followed King Reccared&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism (587), and in 589 he assisted at the Third Council of Toledo.
Bishop Conantius, the biographer of Saint Ildephonsus, assisted at synods and councils in Toledo and composed music and a book of prayers from the Psalms; he ruled the see for more than thirty years, and had for his pupil Fructuosus of Braga.

When the Moors arrived in the early 8th century, resistance was fragmented among bishops in control of the small walled towns and the territorial magnates in their fortified villas. A concerted resistance seems to have been ineffective, and the fragmented system crumbled villa by villa. Palencia was insignificant: Moorish writers only once cite the border city in the division of the provinces previous to the Umayyad dynasty. The diocese of Palencia was but a name— a &quot;titular see&quot;— until Froila, Count of Villafruela, succeeded in retaking the area of the see in 921, but the true restorer of Christian power was Sancho III of Navarre.

The first prelate of the restored see (1035) is said to have been Bernardo, whom Sancho gave feudal command over the city and its lands, with the various castles and the few abbeys. 

Bernardo was born in France or Navarre, and devoted himself to the reconstruction of the original cathedral built over the crypt of the local &quot;Saint Antolín&quot; (Antoninus of Pamiers), the patron saint of Palencia, who is venerated here alone, with his Ferias, a moveable feast in September. The cathedral was rebuilt again three centuries later. Its principal treasures were relics of Antoninus, formerly venerated in Aquitania, whence they had been brought.

Alfonso VI conferred many privileges on Bernardo&#x27;s successor, Raimundo. Pedro of Agen in France, one of the noted men brought in by Bishop Bernardo of Toledo, succeeded Bishop Raimundo. A supporter of Queen Urraca, he was imprisoned by Alfonso I of Aragon. In 1113 a provincial council was held in Palencia by Archbishop Bernardo to quell the disorders of the epoch. The long and beneficent administration of Pedro was succeeded by that of Pedro II, who died in Almeria and was succeeded by Raimundo II. Bishop Tello took part in the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, where Palencia won the right to emblazon the cross over its castle.

Historically, there was a Jewish community in Palencia, with the first documentation of Jews living there dating to 1175, when Alfonso VIII transported 40 Jews to the town and placed them under its jurisdiction. Most Jews of Palencia eventually moved to Portugal in 1492 due to the expulsion of the Jews.

The University of Palencia was founded in 1208, before being a University it was called Studium Generale. 
In the Studium Generale of Palencia studied Saint Dominic of Guzman, the Founder of the Catholic Dominican Order.

===Later bishops===

In 1410 Bishop Sancho de Rojas fought at the battle of Antequera, where the Infante Ferdinand, regent of Castile and León, defeated Mohammed VII, king of Granada, and in the Treaty of Caspe he aided Ferdinand to secure the crown of Aragon. 
Saint Vincent Ferrer preached in Palencia, so successfully converting thousands of Jews, the Catholic sources tell, that he was permitted to employ the synagogue for his new-founded hospital of San Salvador, later joined to that of S. Antolin.

The successive bishops of Palencia, who, as feudal lords, were invariably members of the noble families, include:
* Munio de Zamora
* Sancho el Rojo
* Rodrigo de Velasquito (died 1435)
* Pedro de Castilla (1440–1461)
* Rodrigo Sanchez de Arévalo, author of a history of Spain in Latin (1466)
* Iñigo López de Mendoza (1472–actually)
* Fray Alonso de Burgos (1485–1499)
* Bishop Fonseca (1505–1514)
* La Gasca (1550–1561)
* Zapata (1569–1577)
* Alvaro de Mendoza

==Main sights==
The Roman bridge across the Carrión river was replaced by the medieval one of three arches: the old section of the city is on the left bank, the modern suburban development is on the right bank: it seems likely that the first inhabitants settled on the right bank, and later moved to the left bank—set on higher ground—due to frequent flooding.

La Olmeda Roman Villa (Villa Romana de La Olmeda) is a well-preserved 4th century AD house.
With 27 rooms and 3,000 square metres of space, it is best known for its mosaics, the most important of which depict great mythological scenes and can be found in its main hall. Several of the rooms in the villa also contain the remains of the Roman hypocausts. In addition to the main building, the villa site is surrounded by other Roman ruins such as numerous burial sites and a set of thermal baths.

The old city walls were more than 10 meters high and can still be traced; the &quot;alamedas&quot; or promenades along them were laid out in 1778. The flamboyant Gothic Cathedral, built from 1321 to 1504 and dedicated to San Antolín, stands over a low vaulted Visigothic crypt; its museum contains a number of important works of art, including a &quot;retablo&quot; of twelve panels by Juan de Flandes, court painter to Queen Isabella I of Castile. The Archeological Museum contains Celtiberian ceramics.

Palencia is also famous for the 13th-century church of San Miguel, the San Francisco church. The Calle Mayor (High Street), is a pedestrian, 900-metres long street where many excellent examples of the 18th, 19th and early 20th-century architecture can be seen.

Thirteen kilometres south of the city, in the village of Baños de Cerrato, is the oldest church on the peninsula, a 7th-century basilica dedicated to Saint John and built by the Visigoth King Reccaswinth (died 672). The Plaza de toros de Palencia, a 10,000-capacity bullring, is located in Palencia. It opened in 1976.

== Demographics ==
Palencia&#x27;s population has increased in the last 10 years, from 78,800 inhabitants in the year 1996 to 81,552 in 2011. The town has historically been a centre for immigration from other parts of Spain, particularly between 1950 and 1970 receiving rural immigrants helping industrial development. Nevertheless, today, it has a population with more retirees than the average, due to youth emigration to larger urban centres such as Valladolid, Madrid or Barcelona.

== Nature ==

=== Vegetation ===

The countryside is green from October into June, as it is altered by the snow and the invernal ice. From June or July the countryside becomes a dry place.

The city has the largest landscaped area of Spain in relation to its surface area and is one of the largest in Europe. (15,000,000 m² of gardens in the village: Isabel II Park, Jardinillos Station, Orchard Guadián, La Carcavilla, among others and 14,000,000 &quot;Old Mount&quot;)
In 2010 the city of Palencia won the &quot;most sustainable city in Spain&quot;.

=== Parks in Palencia ===

According to the Municipality of the capital, Palencia is the city with more green areas per inhabitant of Spain and occupies one of the first places in the European Union. This, coupled with the low density of traffic causes that the city air is fairly clean. The main parks in the city are:

== Education ==

The first university in Spain, the &quot;studium generale&quot; of Palencia was founded by Alfonso VIII in 1208; however, the school did not long survive him. The 13th-century poet Gonzalo de Berceo and Saint Dominic, Founder of the Dominican Catholic Order, studied at the University during its brief existence. The teachers from Palencia were drawn to the thriving University of Salamanca and the University of Valladolid, but the very important religious orders remained in Palencia, under the Bishop of Palencia.
The University of Valladolid (UVA) has a campus in Palencia (), inaugurated in 2002.

<text>The Oneida people ( ; : Onʌyoteˀa·ká·, Onyota&#x27;a:ka, &quot;the People of the Upright Stone, or standing stone&quot;, &quot;Thwahrù·nęʼ&quot; in Tuscarora) are a Native American tribe and First Nations band. They are one of the five founding nations of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area of upstate New York, particularly near the Great Lakes.

Originally the Oneida lived in what is now central New York, particularly around Oneida Lake and Oneida County. Today the Oneida have four federally recognized nations: the Oneida Indian Nation in New York, the Oneida Nation in and around Green Bay, Wisconsin, in the United States; and two in Ontario, Canada: Oneida at Six Nations of the Grand River, and Oneida Nation of the Thames in Southwold.
==People of the Standing Stone==
The name Oneida is derived from the English pronunciation of &quot;Onyota&#x27;a:ka&quot;, the people&#x27;s name for themselves. &quot;Onyota&#x27;a:ka&quot; means &quot;People of the Standing Stone&quot;. This identity is based on an ancient legend. The Oneida people were being pursued on foot by an enemy tribe. As their enemies chased the Oneida into a clearing within the woodlands, they suddenly disappeared. The enemy could not find them, and so it was said that the Oneida had shapeshifted into the stones that stood in the clearing. As a result, they became known as the People of the Standing Stone.

Older legends have the Oneida people identifying as &quot;Latilutakówa&quot;, the &quot;Big Tree People&quot;, &quot;People of big trees&quot;. Not much is written about this. Iroquoian elders would have to be consulted on the oral history of this identification. The association may correspond to Iroquoian concepts of the Tree of Peace and the associated belief system of the people.

Individuals born into the Oneida Nation are identified according to their spirit name, or what may be called an Indian name, their clan, and their family unit within a clan. The people have a matrilineal kinship system, and children are considered to be born into the mother&#x27;s clan, through which descent and inheritance passes. Each gender, clan, and family unit within a clan has particular duties and responsibilities in the tribe. Clan identities go back to the Creation Story of the &quot;Onyota&#x27;a:ka&quot; peoples. The people identify with three clans: the Wolf, Turtle or Bear clans. Children take their social status from their mother&#x27;s clan. Because of this, her eldest brother is a significant figure for the children, especially boys. He supervises the boys&#x27; passage into adulthood as men.

==History==

===Homeland boundaries===
During the early 17th century, the Oneidas occupied and maintained roughly 6 million acres of land in what is modern day central New York State. Formal boundaries were established in the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, and again, after September 4, 1784, when the governor of New York, George Clinton, requested from the Oneidas the borders of their land, borders were established in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784).

===American Revolution===
The Oneida, along with the five other tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, initially maintained a policy of neutrality in the American Revolution. This policy allowed the Confederacy increased leverage against both sides in the war, because they could threaten to join one side or the other in the event of any provocation. Neutrality quickly crumbled, however. The preponderance of the Mohawks, Senecas, Cayugas, and Onondagas sided with the Loyalists and British. For some time, the Oneidas continued advocating neutrality and attempted to restore consensus among the six tribes of the Confederacy.

But ultimately the Oneida, as well, had to choose a side. Because of their proximity and relations with the rebel communities, most Oneida favored the revolutionaries. In contrast, some of the pro-British tribes were closer to the British stronghold at Fort Niagara. In addition, the Oneida were influenced by the Presbyterian missionary Samuel Kirkland, who had worked among them since 1764. A number of Oneida were baptized as Christians in the decade before the Revolution. Kirkland worked to help them with education and their struggles with alcohol. Through relations with him, many began to form stronger cultural links to the colonists.

The Oneida officially joined the rebel side and contributed in many ways to the war effort. Their warriors were often used to scout on offensive campaigns and to assess enemy operations around Fort Stanwix (also known as Fort Schuyler). The Oneida also provided an open line of communication between the rebels and their Iroquois foes. In 1777 at the Battle of Oriskany, about fifty Oneida fought alongside the colonial militia, this included Tyonajanegen and her husband Han Yerry. Many Oneida formed friendships with Philip Schuyler, George Washington, the Marquis de Lafayette, and other prominent rebel leaders. Polly Cooper was an Oneida woman who traveled to Valley Forge in 1777 during the American Revolution. Under Chief Skenandon&#x27;s leadership, the Oneidas brought bushels of maize to General George Washington&#x27;s starving Patriot army. Cooper showed Washington&#x27;s people how to properly cook and eat the corn. Washington&#x27;s intentions were to pay cash to Cooper for her generosity, but she refused to accept compensation because she said it was her duty to serve her country. As a token of appreciation, Martha Washington, wife of George Washington, brought Cooper to Philadelphia and bought her a shawl, hat, and bonnet. These men recognized the Oneida contributions during and after the war.

Although leaders of the tribe had taken the colonists&#x27; side, individuals within the decentralized nation could make their own decisions about alliances. A minority, who were already a faction supporting the sachems, supported the British. As the war progressed and the Oneida position became more dire, this minority grew more numerous. Later numerous Oneida defected from the rebellion and relocated to Fort Niagara to live under British protection.

==1838 treaty in Wisconsin==
Essentially the Oneida had to share land at the Onondaga Reservation and did not have land to call their own. In the 1820s and 1830s many of the Oneida remaining in New York relocated to Wisconsin, where they were allowed to buy land, and to Canada, because the United States was pressing for Indian removals from eastern states. Settlers kept encroaching on them.

In 1838 Daniel Bread (1800–1873) helped negotiate a treaty for the Oneida in Wisconsin by which they asserted their intention to hold their piece of land communally. The amount of land had been reduced by the U.S., as had happened to the Menominee-Stockbridge Indians.

==Oneida land claims==
Cornelius Hill succeeded Daniel Bread as Chief after his death in 1873, and for decades fought further relocation of the Oneida, as well as privatization of common lands pursuant to the Dawes Act of 1887, which allowed such after a 25-year trust period. Hill, however, was based in Wisconsin and died in 1907, ostensibly during the trust period which would expire around 1920. After Hill&#x27;s death, William Rockwell, a conservative, led the Oneida in New York essentially from 1910 to 1960.

Women Oneida activists pushed tribal land claims in the early 20th century. Laura &quot;Minnie&quot; Cornelius Kellogg and her attorney husband (from the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin), and Mary Cornelius Winder and her sister Delia Cornelius Waterman (from the Oneida Indian Nation of New York) were particularly influential from 1920 on in pressing land claims. The women worked from their homes in Prattsburg, New York, and Oneida, Wisconsin. Particularly after the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, Winder and her sister reached out to the Oneida of Wisconsin, and both American branches of the nation pushed jointly for their land claim. At that point, the remaining Oneida in New York had no land, and were subject to the Onondaga sharing their reservation.

They were encouraged by passage of the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946, as before that they were unable to bring claims against the US government.

In 1970 and 1974 the Oneida Indian Nation of New York, Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, and the Oneida Nation of the Thames (made up of descendants of people who did not move to Canada until the 1840s) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to reclaim land taken from them by New York without approval of the United States Congress. In 1998, the United States intervened in the lawsuits on behalf of the plaintiffs in the claim so the claim could proceed against New York State. The state had asserted immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Defendants moved for summary judgment based on the U. S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation&quot; and the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals&#x27; decision in &quot;Cayuga Indian Nation v. New York&quot;

On May 21, 2007, Judge Kahn dismissed the Oneida&#x27;s possessory land claims and allowed the non-possessory claims to proceed. More recent litigation has formalized the split. It defines the separate interests of the Oneida tribe who stayed in New York and those who relocated to Wisconsin. 

==Diet==
The people made use of the land by &quot;eating the seasons.&quot; With a lack of fresh foods in the winter, during the autumn months, the Oneidas dried fruits and vegetables which they had harvested. They also preserved meats in a brine or salt solution, and then hung them to dry. During the fall they would eat deer, geese, duck and raccoon. Feasting on those meats would store fat which would help them survive during the winter. The Oneidas&#x27; diet also consisted of nuts such as hickory nuts, black walnuts, butternuts, and chestnuts. The nuts added protein and fat that were needed to make it through the winter. They also dried wild rice, which grew in swamp lands. The wild rice was a source of complex carbohydrates. When spring rolled around, the snow began to melt and the region became warm, the Oneidas&#x27; diet would change. They would boil down and eat wild onions, leeks, milkweeds, and dandelions. Spring was also when their fishing season began. The fish in their diet consisted of trout, bullhead, walleye, pike, bass, and salmon. Also during the spring months, maple trees provided sap that would be collected, then boiled down to make syrup and hard candy. The maple candy would be used for consumption in this form or saved for later to flavor foods. During the summer months the Oneidas would consume various fruits such as strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, pears, plums, peaches, apples, and grapes. The Oneidas also used sassafras for tea.

==Dancing==
There are two types of Oneida dancing: social and ceremonial. Social dancing is for the enjoyment of all people. The round dance, rabbit dance, old moccasin dance and canoe or fishing dance are different types of social dances. Ceremonial dancing is sacred and is not to be performed in public. Sacred dances are meant to be performed privately in the longhouses. The Maple Syrup, Strawberry, Bean, Sun and Moon dances are different types of ceremonial dances. Singing is a part of ceremonial dancing; however, they only chant during social dances. There is an introduction for every song. When the beat changes, the dancing begins. Cues are given from the drums, which indicate to the dancers when to switch partners. If a dancer was invited to dance, but refused, etiquette required them to offer tobacco as a settlement.

== Traditional clothing ==
Clothing carries great meaning in the Oneida culture, as it is a physical representation of who they are. Before coming into contact with the Europeans, the Oneida tribe would use only natural materials to make their clothing. This would include using deer and other animal hides to stitch together clothing. However, when the Europeans arrived trading began and their clothing that was once made from animal hides began to be made from calico cotton and broadcloth and has stuck to be made from cotton ever since. The Oneidas would typically only be seen wearing moccasins on their feet. Even though there was a change in material used, the basic design of the outfits remained the same and still remains the same hundreds of years later.

Headwear: Oneida men and women wore different headwear. For the men, they would wear traditional Iroquois headdresses called kastoweh which would consist of feathers and insignia representing their tribe. The insignia for the Oneida Nation consists of three eagle feathers; two standing straight up and one falling downwards. Oneida women on the other hand would wear beaded tiaras. The beadwork on the tiaras would most commonly be sewn in woodland designs as it is a representation of their nation.

<text>The Government of Canada () is the body responsible for the federal administration of Canada. The term &quot;Government of Canada&quot; refers specifically to the executive, which includes ministers of the Crown (together in the Cabinet) and the federal civil service (whom the Cabinet direct); it is alternatively known as His Majesty&#x27;s Government () and is corporately branded as the &quot;Government of Canada&quot;. There are over 100 departments and agencies, as well as over 300,000 persons employed in the Government of Canada. These institutions carry out the programs and enforce the laws established by the Parliament of Canada.

The federal government&#x27;s organization and structure was established at Confederation, through the Constitution Act, 1867, wherein the Canadian Crown acts as the core, or &quot;the most basic building block&quot;, of its Westminster-style parliamentary democracy. The monarch, is head of state and is personally represented by a governor general (currently Mary Simon). A prime minister (currently Justin Trudeau) is the head of government, who is invited by the Crown to form a government after securing the confidence of the House of Commons, which is typically determined through the election of enough members of a single political party in a federal election to provide a majority of seats in Parliament, forming a governing party. Further elements of governance are outlined in the rest of the Canadian constitution, which includes written statutes in addition to court rulings and unwritten conventions developed over centuries.

Constitutionally, the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada is the body that advises the sovereign or their representative on the exercise of executive power. This task is carried out nearly exclusively by the Cabinet, which functions as the executive committee of the Privy Council that sets the government&#x27;s policies and priorities for the country and is chaired by the prime minister. The sovereign appoints the members of Cabinet on the advice of the prime minister who, by convention, are generally selected primarily from the House of Commons (although often include a limited number of members from the Senate). During its term, the government must retain the confidence of the House of Commons and certain important motions, such as money bills and the speech from the throne, are considered as confidence motions. Laws are formed by the passage of bills through Parliament, which are either sponsored by the government or individual members of Parliament. Once a bill has been approved by both the House of Commons and the Senate, royal assent is required to make the bill become law. The laws are then the responsibility of the government to oversee and enforce.

==Terminology==
Under Canada&#x27;s Westminster-style parliamentary democracy, the terms &quot;government&quot; and &quot;Government of Canada&quot; refer specifically to the prime minister, Cabinet, and other members of the governing party inside the House of Commons, but typically includes the federal public service and federal departments and agencies when used elsewhere. This differs from the United States, where the executive branch is referred to as an &quot;administration&quot; and the federal government encompasses executive, legislative, and judicial powers, similar to the Canadian Crown.

In press releases issued by federal departments, the government has sometimes been referred to as the current prime minister&#x27;s government (e.g. the &quot;Trudeau Government&quot;). This terminology has been commonly employed in the media. In late 2010, an informal instruction from the Office of the Prime Minister urged government departments to consistently use, in all department communications, such phrasing (i.e., &quot;Harper Government&quot;, at the time), in place of &quot;Government of Canada&quot;. The same Cabinet earlier directed its press department to use the phrase &quot;Canada&#x27;s New Government&quot;.

==Role of the Crown==

Canada is a constitutional monarchy, wherein the role of the reigning sovereign is both legal and practical, but not political. The monarch is vested with all powers of state and sits at the centre of a construct in which the power of the whole is shared by multiple institutions of government acting under the sovereign&#x27;s authority. The executive is thus formally referred to as the &quot;King-in-Council&quot;.

On the advice of the Canadian prime minister, the sovereign appoints a federal viceregal representative—the governor general (currently Mary Simon)—who, since 1947, is permitted to exercise almost all of the monarch&#x27;s royal prerogative; though, there are some duties which must be specifically performed by the monarch themselves (such as assent of certain bills). In case of the governor general&#x27;s absence or incapacitation, the administrator of Canada performs the Crown&#x27;s most basic functions.

As part of the royal prerogative, the royal sign-manual gives authority to letters patent and orders-in-Council. Much of the royal prerogative is only exercised in-council, meaning on the advice of the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada (ministers of the Crown formed in Cabinet in conventional practice); within the conventional stipulations of a constitutional monarchy, the sovereign&#x27;s direct participation in any of these areas of governance is limited.

==Prime Minister and Cabinet==
The term &quot;Government of Canada&quot;, or more formally, &quot;Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot; refers to the activities of the &quot;-in-Council&quot;. The day-to-day operation and activities of the Government of Canada are performed by the federal departments and agencies, staffed by the Public Service of Canada, and the Canadian Armed Forces.

=== Prime minister ===
One of the main duties of the Crown is to ensure that a democratic government is always in place, which includes the appointment of a prime minister, who heads the Cabinet and directs the activities of the government. Not outlined in any constitutional document, the office exists in long-established convention, which stipulates the Crown must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons, who, in practice, is typically the leader of the political party that holds more seats than any other party in that chamber (currently the Liberal Party, led by Justin Trudeau). Should no particular party hold a majority in the House of Commons, the leader of one party—either the party with the most seats or one supported by other parties—will be called by the governor general to form a minority government. Once sworn in, the prime minister holds office until their resignation or removal by the governor general, after either a motion of no confidence or defeat in a general election.

=== Privy Council ===
The executive is defined in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; as the Crown acting on the advice of the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, referred to as the &quot;-in-Council&quot;. However, the Privy Council—consisting mostly of former ministers, chief justices, and other elder statesmen—rarely meets in full. In the construct of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, the advice tendered is typically binding, meaning the monarch &quot;reigns&quot; but does not &quot;rule&quot;, with the Cabinet ruling &quot;in trust&quot; for the monarch. However, the royal prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers, and there are rare exceptions where the monarch may be obliged to act unilaterally to prevent manifestly unconstitutional acts.

==== Cabinet ====

The stipulations of responsible government require that those who directly advise the Crown on the exercise the royal prerogative be accountable to the elected House of Commons and the day-to-day operation of government is guided only by a sub-group of the Privy Council made up of individuals who hold seats in Parliament, known as the Cabinet.

The monarch and governor general typically follow the near-binding advice of their ministers. The royal prerogative, however, belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers, who only rule &quot;in trust&quot; for the monarch and who must relinquish the Crown&#x27;s power back to it upon losing the confidence of the commons, whereupon a new government, which &quot;can&quot; hold the lower chamber&#x27;s confidence, is installed by the governor general. The royal and vice-royal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations (an exercise of the reserve powers), thereby allowing the monarch to make sure &quot;that the government conducts itself in compliance with the constitution.&quot; Politicians can sometimes try to use to their favour to obscure the complexity of the relationship between the monarch, viceroy, ministers, and Parliament, as well as the public&#x27;s general unfamiliarity with such.

<text>Albacete ( , , ) is a city and municipality in the Spanish autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha, and capital of the province of Albacete.

Lying in the south-east of the Iberian Peninsula, the area around the city is known as Los Llanos. Halfway between Madrid and the Mediterranean coast, it enjoys connections by motorway, railway (including AVE), and air (Albacete Airport). With a population of 174,336 (2020), it is the largest municipality of Castilla–La Mancha. The municipality of Albacete is also the seventh-largest in Spain by total area, being . Albacete is the seat to the regional High Court of Justice.

The origins of the city are uncertain, with the earliest proof of settlement dating to the time of Al-Andalus, when the settlement was originally named (), meaning &quot;The Flat&quot; in Arabic, referring to the flat land around. Albacete was the main headquarters of the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War

Part of the historic region of La Mancha, Albacete has a reputation as a producer of clasp knives. Its flat area and the removal of architectural barriers have reportedly made it one of the most accessible cities across the country.

Among the several festivals celebrated in the city, the September Feria de Albacete stands out, declared as a festival of &quot;International Tourist Interest&quot;.

Albacete is home to multinational corporations like the Albacete Airport and has five large industrial zones, including Campollano, the largest industrial area of Castilla–La Mancha. Albacete houses one of the campus of the University of Castilla–La Mancha, the Biomedical Campus of Albacete and the Technology Park of Albacete.

The aviation industry is one of the main economic engines of the city. Albacete hosts the School of TLP NATO pilots, Los Llanos Air Base.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Albacete&quot; is derived from the Andalusian name for the area, the city having been originally called () in Arabic, which translates to &quot;the plain&quot; in reference to the plateau that characterizes the geography of the area.

Pascual Madoz in his famous &quot;Diccionario geográfico-estadístico-histórico de España y sus posesiones de Ultramar&quot; (Geographical-historical-statistical Dictionary of Spain and its overseas territories) indicates that two hypotheses about the toponym of Albacete are probable. In the first place he highlights the proposal suggested by Bernardo Espinalt y Garcia, who believes that the city was founded by the Cilicians, who called it &quot;Celtide&quot; relying on Liutprand of Cremona, &quot; (in Spain this place is called Celtide, which the Moors called Albacene incorrectly)&quot;. The second hypothesis states that its origin may be the &quot;Alaba&quot; of the Celtiberians, mentioned by Pliny the Elder and by Ptolemy, which could result in (&quot;White city&quot;), which later became &quot;Albacete&quot;.

The most common adjective used to refer to the inhabitants of Albacete is , or , without prejudice to the demonyms used for the inhabitants of the various population centers that make up the area such as the (inhabitants of Agua Nuevo) or for the neighboring Aguas Nuevas (among others).

==History==

The origins of the city are uncertain, although the first few confirmations of its existence are found during the Moorish domination of the area, when it was a small Moorish village. Its name is derived from the Arabic , &quot;El Llano&quot; (&quot;the plain&quot;) referring to the planiform nature of the geography of the area.

The battle of Albacete, at which the Emir Zafadola was killed, was fought near Albacete in 1146.

In 1240, Albacete capitulated to Ferdinand III, who had support from the Order of Santiago and knights from the land of Alarcón. Soon after, in 1241, in return for help provided, the monarch donated the place to Alarcón. The hamlet of Albacete was transferred from Alarcón to Chinchilla by Alfonso X in 1269.

Albacete was granted the privilege of town (&quot;villa&quot;) in 1375 by Don Juan Manuel, prince of Villena, becoming independent from Chinchilla and granted a &quot;fuero&quot; in that time. A century later, in 1476, the Catholic Monarchs rewarded Albacete for supporting the Crown by granting it a licence to hold a market once a week.

During the Revolt of the Comuneros (1520–22), after initial protests, Albacete supported the new emperor Charles V, who in 1526 granted the feudal estate of the town to his wife, the Empress Isabella of Portugal. During this period, construction started on the church of San Juan Bautista (St John the Baptist), which was later to become a cathedral.

Albacete is located in a strategic position between Madrid and the east coast of Spain and its agricultural wealth led to the growth of the borough during the next few centuries until Philip V granted permission for an annual fair (1710). This fair was later held in an enclosure built by Charles III (1783).

In the early 19th century, in the context of the discussion for the creation of a new province upon territory belonging to New Castile and Murcia, Albacete vied for the capital status of the intended demarcation against nearby Chinchilla. They had a similar population at the time, although Albacete probably had the edge in economic prowess. Chinchilla briefly became head of province during the &quot;trienio liberal&quot; before the absolutist crackdown of Ferdinand VII, but the definitive 1833 territorial division devised by Javier de Burgos established Albacete as capital of the new province of Albacete.

Soon after, in 1834, an &quot;Audiencia Territorial&quot; (a regional court) was established in Albacete, exercising jurisdiction over a demarcation comprising the provinces of Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Murcia and Albacete.

Railway reached Albacete on 18 March 1855, as the Alcázar de San Juan–Albacete stretch of the Madrid–Almansa line was opened on that day. Albacete was granted the title of city (&quot;ciudad&quot;) through a Royal Decree issued in November 1862, during the reign of Isabella II. Following the opening of the Chinchilla–Cartagena railway in 1865, Albacete also became connected to the latter city.

Social inequality in the 19th century was rampant, with overwhelming rates of illiteracy in areas dwelled by day laborers. Meanwhile, the &quot;middle class&quot; consisted chiefly of civil servants and lawyers (thanks to hosting the seat of the &quot;Audiencia&quot;) as well a reduced number of merchants. Street electric lighting was inaugurated in 1888, thus being the first capital of a province in Spain with electric lighting in its streets.

Throughout the 19th century, the population of the town doubled from the 10,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the century to around 21,000 by the beginning of the 20th century. During this period, Albacete defended Queen Isabel II against the Carlists (the supporters of Charles, the pretender to the Spanish throne), supported Espartero and, just like other Spanish cities, constituted a revolutionary junta. During the long period of the Restoration (1875–1923), symptoms of &quot;caciquismo&quot; (the network of social relations based on clientelism underpinning the political life in the rural areas) became pervasive in the political and social life of Albacete.

Between 1900 and the end of the Spanish Civil War (1939), the population tripled. A number of basic public works date back to that time: the water supply and sewer system (1905), the Abelardo Sanchez Park (1910–23), Tesifonte Gallego Street and the industrial area of the town.

During the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), after a brief lapse in the power of the troops who had rebelled against the Republican government, the town fell back into the hands of Madrid. For most of the war, the airbase at Los Llanos was the main headquarters of the Republican air force. It was also the headquarters of the International Brigades (supporters of the Republican cause from other countries who fought in the Spanish Civil war) and a monument has been built recently to commemorate the sixty years&#x27; anniversary of those events. The first volume of Peter Weiss&#x27; novel &quot;The Aesthetics of Resistance&quot; is located in Albacete&#x27;s Civil War days hospital &quot;Cueva La Potita&quot;.

In the time of the transition to democracy, the two most significant events were the establishment in Albacete in 1982 of the High Court of Justice of Castilla–La Mancha, according to article 23 of the Statute of Autonomy of the Community. Casa de Quevedo, and the consolidation of the University, which brought new life to the town in 1985.

==Geography==
===Location===
Albacete is located in the South-East of the Iberian Peninsula, in the plains of La Mancha (part of the Inner Plateau), at an elevation of about .

The surrounding region, the so-called &quot;Mancha de Albacete&quot; stands out for its horizontality. The municipality lies to a large extent on an endorheic area, prone to water-logging after heavy rains. In that sense, the urban nucleus was in fact an endemic focus of malaria until the Royal Canal of Albacete was built.

The local soil is low in organic matter and at risk, although slight, of erosion.

===Climate===
Albacete has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;). Winters are cool while summers are hot. Winters and summers are usually dry. Because of the continental nature of the climate there is a large temperature variation during the year. Precipitation is low and mainly concentrated in spring and autumn usually falling in the form of rain, but there is occasional snow.

== Government and administration ==
=== Justice administration ===
The town is home to the High Court of Justice of Castile-La Mancha (TSJCLM), the highest court of the autonomous region. The president of the Superior Court is Vicente Manuel Rouco Rodríguez, which is the highest representative of judiciary to Castilla–La Mancha. The High Court, established in 1989, based on the Palace of Justice in Albacete, is divided into three rooms: the Chamber of Civil and Criminal, the Board of Administrative Litigation and the Room social.

The city also hosts the Institute of Legal Medicine of Albacete, Cuenca and Guadalajara, whose scope corresponds to homonymous provinces. Moreover, the Manchego capital is the seat of Bar Council of Castilla–La Mancha and Notary Association of Castilla–La Mancha.

The long legal tradition of Albacete goes back to 1834, when the Territorial Court of Albacete (predecessor of the High Court), which extended its jurisdiction over the provinces of Albacete was created Ciudad Real and Cuenca and the Murcia.

The city also has a Provincial Court and head judicial district of Albacete, the judicial No. 1 province, whose demarcation comprises the city and over 15 municipalities, mainly of metropolitan area, which adds a Dean.

The legal infrastructure is completed by two courts Administrative Litigation three trial courts, juvenile court, one for violence against women, three of Criminal Seven of First Instance, three social courts. In this sense we must bear in mind that the Autonomous Community of Castilla–La Mancha does not exercise the powers in justice. All courts of the city unless the Superior Court of Castilla–La Mancha will be based in the new City of Justice in Albacete.

In addition, on the outskirts of the city is the Albacete Prison, known as The Prison Torrecica, established in 1981, and the Center for Children Albaidel, born in 1993.

== Demographics ==
With 173,329 inhabitants as of 1 January 2019, according to data from the INE, Albacete is the most populous city in the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha, the city with the highest number of people in the South Submeseta after Madrid and one of the inner cities most populated Spain.

Demographic trends drawn historically sustained growth slowed somewhat in the 1950s, and very strong in recent years (+71% between 1970 and 2005, and 13% between 2000 and 2008). In 1999 there was segregation and subsequent emancipation of Pozo Cañada of the municipality of Albacete, establishing itself as an independent municipality.

Of the total 172  487 people surveyed in 2014, 10 851 were foreign nationals, representing 6.3% of the total. These immigrants come from all continents, the most numerous colonies of Romanian nationality (1 743), Bolivia (1 207), Morocco (1 074) and Colombia (974).

According to the Gazetteer of 2013, the municipality in addition to the capital city-the city of Albacete it includes a smaller local organization (Aguas Nuevas) and sixteen rural areas (The Salobral, Santa Ana, Bacariza, Argamasón, Tinajeros, Campillo of Doblas, The Anguijes, Abuzaderas, Cerrolobo, Casa de las Monjas, House Captain, Great House, Los Llanos, The Pulgosa, The Torrecica and Villar de Pozo Rubio).

For some years it is producing a demographic phenomenon around the city of Albacete, called Metropolitan area attraction which currently encompasses a population of 219 121 inhabitants between the city and nearby, and with strong growth stocks, whose projections for 2020 estimate that exceeds 300 000, because it is one of the areas with the highest growth projection and expansion throughout the southeast Spanish.

The metropolitan area of Albacete consists of Albacete and fourteen other near the capital municipalities: La Roda, Tarazona de la Mancha, Burrows, Chinchilla de Monte-Aragon, Pozo Cañada, La Gineta, Balazote, Barrax, Valdeganga, Mahora, Motilleja, Fuensanta, La Herrera and Montalvos.

The demonym used to describe the inhabitants of the town of Albacete is albaceteño, -ña or albacetense.
