<text>The Douglas A-20 Havoc (company designation DB-7) is an American light bomber, attack aircraft, night intruder, night fighter, and reconnaissance aircraft of World War II.

Designed to meet an Army Air Corps requirement for a bomber, it was ordered by France for their air force before the USAAC decided it would also meet their requirements. French DB-7s were the first to see combat; after the fall of France, the bomber served with the Royal Air Force under the service name Boston. From 1941, night fighter and intruder versions were given the service name Havoc. In 1942 USAAF A-20s saw combat in North Africa.

It served with several Allied air forces, principally the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), the Soviet Air Forces (&quot;VVS&quot;), Soviet Naval Aviation (&quot;AVMF&quot;), and the Royal Air Force (RAF) of the United Kingdom. A total of 7,478 aircraft were built, of which more than a third served with Soviet units. It was also used by the air forces of Australia, South Africa, France, and the Netherlands during the war, and by Brazil afterwards.

In most British Commonwealth air forces, the bomber variants were known as Boston, while the night fighter and intruder variants were named Havoc. The exception was the Royal Australian Air Force, which used the name Boston for all variants. The USAAF used the P-70 designation to refer to the night fighter variants.

==Design and development==
In March 1936, a design team headed by Donald Douglas, Jack Northrop, and Ed Heinemann produced a proposal for a bomber-reconnaissance aircraft powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior 9-cylinder radial engines mounted on a shoulder wing. It was estimated to be capable of with a bomb load. Reports of aircraft performance from the Spanish Civil War indicated that this design would be seriously underpowered, and it was canceled.
In 1937, the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) issued a new specification for an attack aircraft. To meet this requirement, the Douglas team, now headed by Heinemann, developed the Model 7B, with a similar layout to the 7A, but was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-S3C3-G Twin Wasp 14-cylinder engines, and carried a bombload of up to . It faced competition from the North American NA-40, Stearman X-100, Martin 167F, and an unbuilt design from Bell Aircraft, the Model 9. The Air Corps invited all five companies to build prototypes at their own expense and to submit sealed bids for production of their aircraft.

The prototype Model 7B made its first flight on 26 October 1938. The model attracted the attention of a French Purchasing Commission visiting the United States. The French discreetly participated in the flight trials, so as not to attract criticism from American isolationists. The Model 7B crashed on 23 January 1939 while demonstrating single-engine performance, killing the test pilot and seriously injuring a French observer aboard the aircraft. The presence of a foreigner on a test flight for an aircraft still under development caused a scandal in the press. Despite the crash, the French were impressed enough to place an order for 100 production aircraft on 15 February 1939, following this up with an order for 170 more in October 1939.

As a result of the French order, Heinemann carried out another major redesign of the aircraft. While the design&#x27;s wings were largely unchanged, the revised design had a new deeper but narrower fuselage, which accommodated a crew of three – a pilot, bombardier and a gunner. The wing was mounted lower than on the Model 7B, while the engines, R-1830-SC3-Gs, were mounted in nacelles slung under the wings. Normal bombload was , or in overload conditions, with a defensive armament of single 7.5mm MAC 1934 machine guns in dorsal and ventral mounts and four fixed forward-firing guns in the nose. The revised aircraft, the DB-7, first flew on 17 August 1939.

In 1939, the USAAC decided that the new bomber was best placed to meet its requirements for an attack bomber, which had been updated in 1938 from those that gave rise to the Model 7B, and in June 1939, it ordered 186 aircraft powered by Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone engines, under the designations A-20 and A-20A (with the A-20s having turbosupercharged R-2600-7 engines and the A-20As having supercharged R-2600-3 or -11 engines). These had a larger vertical tail to cope with the increased power of the Wright engines, had a longer nose to give more room for the bombardier/navigator, and carried more fuel. R-2600 powered aircraft also proved popular for export, with France ordering 100 DB-7As powered by the R-2600 but with the short nose of the DB-7 in October 1939, and 480 long-nosed DB-73s, equivalent to the A-20A, in April 1940 and Britain ordering 300 DB-7Bs, again equivalent to the A-20A in February and April 1940.

In a report to the British Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (AAEE) at RAF Boscombe Down, test pilots summed it up as: &quot;has no vices and is very easy to take off and land ... The aeroplane represents a definite advantage in the design of flying controls ... extremely pleasant to fly and manoeuvre.&quot; Ex-pilots often consider it their favorite aircraft of the war due to the ability to toss it around like a fighter. The Douglas bomber/night fighter was found to be extremely adaptable and found a role in every combat theater of the war, and excelled as a true &quot;pilot&#x27;s aeroplane&quot;.

When DB-7 series production finally ended on 20 September 1944, a total of 7,098 had been built by Douglas and a further 380 by Boeing. Douglas redesigned its Santa Monica plant to create a mechanized production line to produce A-20 Havocs. The assembly line was over a mile long (6,100 feet), but by looping back and forth, fitted into a building that was only 700 feet long. Man-hours were reduced by 50% for some operations while production tripled.

==Operational history==
===France===
The French order called for substantial modifications to meet French standards, resulting in the DB-7 (Douglas Bomber 7) variant. It had a narrower, deeper fuselage, Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-SC3-G radials, French-built guns, and metric instruments. Midway through the delivery phase, engines were switched to Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-S3C4-G. The French designation was DB-7 B-3 (the B-3 signifying &quot;three-seat bomber&quot;).

DB-7s began to be delivered from Douglas&#x27;s El Segundo, California production line on 31 October 1939, and the passing of the &quot;Cash and Carry&quot; act on 4 November 1939 allowed the aircraft to be handed over in the United States to the French, who would then be responsible for delivering the aircraft. The DB-7s were shipped to Casablanca in French North Africa where they were reassembled and tested before being handed over to operational units of the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;. When the Germans attacked France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940, about 70 DB-7s had reached North Africa, equipping three &quot;Escadrilles&quot; (squadrons), which were transferred from Africa to the French mainland in response to the German attack. They flew about 70 sorties against the advancing Germans during the Battle of France, with at least eight aircraft being lost, but before the armistice surviving aircraft were evacuated to North Africa to avoid capture. Here, they came under the control of the Vichy government and briefly engaged the Allies during Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942.

After French forces in North Africa had joined the Allies, DB-7s were used as trainers and were replaced in front line escadrilles with Martin B-26 Marauders. Free French squadron I/120 &quot;Lorraine&quot;, under RAF control, was based in England and re-equipped in 1943 with Boston IIIAs, later with Boston IVs. It was part of No. 2 Group RAF and then the Second Tactical Air Force and carried out numerous raids against targets in mainland Europe.

In late 1944 to early 1945, a few surviving ex-French DB-7s were moved to mainland France, where they saw action against the remaining isolated German pockets on the western coast.

===British Commonwealth===

After the Fall of France, there were still a substantial number of DB-7s which had not yet been delivered to the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air.&quot; The remainder of the order which was to have been delivered to France was instead taken up by the UK via the British Purchasing Commission. In the course of the war, 24 squadrons operated the Boston in Britain, the Mediterranean and North Africa.

The French had originally intended to use the DB-7 as a short-range tactical attack aircraft, but its range was too short for the RAF to be able to use them as light bombers against German targets in Europe. The RAF was in desperate need of any aircraft suitable for night fighting and intruder duties. The type saw its first operations with the RAF in early 1941, when 181 Boston Mk IIs began to be flown as night fighters and intruders. There were two basic versions of the Havoc I, an Intruder version (glazed nose, five 0.30-inch machine guns and 2,400 pounds of bombs) and a Night Fighter version (AI Mk.IV radar and eight 0.30-inch machine guns).

Some Havocs were converted to Turbinlite aircraft which replaced the nose position with a powerful searchlight. The Turbinlite aircraft would be brought onto a hostile aircraft by ground radar control. The onboard radar operator would then direct the pilot until he could illuminate the enemy. At that point a Hawker Hurricane fighter accompanying the Turbinlite aircraft would make the attack. The Turbinlite squadrons were disbanded in early 1943.

All the French DB-7As, an improved DB-7 version, were delivered to the RAF, where they were given the name Havoc II and converted to night fighters. Eventually the British Purchasing Commission ordered a British version as the DB-7B and the RAF named it Boston III. The Boston III was the first to operate with the RAF as a light bomber. They were supplied to squadrons in the United Kingdom and Middle East (later moved to bases in Italy) replacing Bristol Blenheims. Their first raid took place in February 1942. Many Boston IIIs were modified to Turbinlite or Intruder planes.

===Soviet Union===

Through Lend-Lease, Soviet forces received more than two-thirds of the A-20B variant manufactured and a significant portion of G and H variants. The A-20 was the most numerous foreign aircraft in the Soviet bomber inventory. The Soviet Air Force had more A-20s than the USAAF.

They were delivered via the ALSIB (Alaska-Siberia) air ferry route. The aircraft had its baptism of fire at the end of June 1942. The Soviets were dissatisfied with the four .30-calibre Browning machine guns, capable of 600 rounds per gun per minute, and replaced them with the faster-firing, calibre ShKAS, capable of up to 1,800 rounds per gun per minute. During the summer of 1942, the Bostons flew ultra-low-level raids against German convoys heavily protected by flak. Attacks were made from altitudes as low as and the air regiments suffered heavy losses.

By mid-1943 Soviet pilots were familiar with the A-20B and A-20C. The general opinion was that the aircraft was overpowered and therefore fast and agile. It could make steep turns of up to 65° of bank angle, while the tricycle landing gear made for easier take-offs and landings. The type could be flown even by crews with minimal training. The engines were reliable but sensitive to low temperatures, so the Soviet engineers developed special covers for keeping propeller hubs from freezing up.

Some of these aircraft were armed with fixed-forward cannons and found some success in the ground attack role.

By the end of the war, 3,414 A-20s had been delivered to the USSR, 2,771 of which were used by the Soviet Air Force.

===Netherlands===
In October 1941 the Netherlands government in exile ordered 48 DB-7C planes for use in the Dutch East Indies.
Delivery had been scheduled for May 1942 but because of the desperate situation US government agreed to divert 32 DB-7B Boston III aircraft to the Dutch East Indies in advance.

The first six were delivered by ship in February 1942. Only one aircraft was assembled in time to take part in the action. The Japanese captured the remaining aircraft of the delivery, and at least one was repaired and later tested by the Imperial Japanese Army.
===Australia===

The next 22 DB-7Bs to be delivered to the East Indies were diverted to the Royal Australian Air Force. They served with No. 22 Squadron RAAF and fought in the East Indies from September 1942. RAAF Bostons took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea and in attacks on a large Japanese convoy headed toward Lae.

Some A-20A/C/G planes arrived from the US from September 1943. By November 1944, No 22 Squadron was going to be assigned to the Philippines. Thirteen Bostons were destroyed on the ground during a Japanese raid on Morotai. The squadron was withdrawn to Noemfoor, where it was re-equipped with Bristol Beaufighters before it returned to action. Surviving Bostons were relegated to transport, mail delivery and communications.

===United States===
In 1940, the US military&#x27;s indifference to the type was overcome by improvements made for the French and British Commonwealth air forces.

The USAAC was impressed enough by the A-20A&#x27;s high power to weight ratio and easy handling characteristics. Two variants were ordered, in a tranche of more than 200 aircraft: the A-20 for high-altitude daylight bombing and the A-20A for low- and medium-altitude missions. It was intended that the high-altitude variant would be fitted with turbosupercharged Wright R-2600-7 engines; after a prototype suffered technical problems, the USAAC changed its order and an initial shipment of 123 A-20As (with less-powerful R-2600-3 engines) and 20 A-20s (R-2600-11) entered service in early 1941. A further 59 aircraft from this first order were received as P-70 night fighters, with two-stage supercharged R-2600-11 engines.

The A-20B, another high-altitude bomber variant – lacking heavy armor and self-sealing fuel tanks – received a significant order from the USAAC: 999 aircraft (although two-thirds of these were exported to the USSR). With the lessons of the Pacific in mind USAAF ordered A-20G in June 1942.

====Pacific====

A major shipment of DB-73s originally destined for France was retained by the US government and converted to A-20C/G attack configuration. The USAAF received 356, most of which were operated by the 5th Air Force in the South West Pacific theater. When the war started 27th Bombardment Group (minus its A-20As) was in the process of being sent to the Philippines where it was to have been re-established as an A-20 unit, but the first operational unit in actual combat was the 89th Bombardment Squadron which began operations in New Guinea on August 31, 1942.
In early 1944, 312th and 417th Bombardment Groups were sent to New Guinea, equipped with A-20Gs. Most sorties were flown at low altitudes, as Japanese flak was not as deadly as German flak, and it was soon found that there was little need for a bomb aimer. Consequently, the bomb aimer was replaced by additional machine guns mounted in a faired-over nose. A-20Gs were an ideal weapon for pinpoint strikes against aircraft, hangars, and supply dumps.
When operating in formation their heavy forward firepower could overwhelm shipboard antiaircraft defenses and at wave-top level (resembling a torpedo run) they could skip their bombs into the sides of transports and destroyers with deadly effect. In addition, the captains of small Japanese escorts (destroyers, for example) assumed the approaching aircraft were making torpedo runs and turned their vessels bow-on to the aircraft in defense, making the strafing far more devastating to the unarmored escorts and often leaving them even more vulnerable to follow-up &quot;skip-bombing&quot; runs.

After the New Guinea campaign, the A-20s squadrons moved to the Philippines. In 1944, three full four-squadron A-20 groups were active in the campaign that led to the invasion of Luzon. After the Philippines were secured, A-20s attacked Japanese targets in Formosa.

The first night-fighter squadron to use P-70s in combat was based at Henderson Field to intercept high-flying Japanese night raiders. The 418th and 421st Night Fighter Squadrons briefly flew P-70s in New Guinea. The P-70s scored only two kills during the Pacific war as its performance was not good enough to intercept Japanese night raiders, and were replaced by Northrop P-61 Black Widows as soon as possible.

====Europe and Mediterranean====
In Europe, USAAF A-20 crews flew their first combat missions attached to RAF units. On 4 July 1942, 12 crews from the 15th Bombardment Squadron became the first members of the 8th Air Force to enter combat. They flew Bostons belonging to No. 226 Squadron RAF from bases in England on missions against enemy airfields in the Netherlands.

USAAF A-20s were assigned to North Africa and flew their first combat mission from Youks-les-Bains, Algeria, in December 1942. They provided valuable tactical support to allied ground troops, especially during and following the Battle of Kasserine Pass. During the North African campaign, many of the A-20s were fitted with additional forward-firing machine guns. Following the German surrender in Tunisia, the A-20s moved to bases in Italy, Corsica, France, and then back to Italy in January 1945.
Four P-70 night fighter squadrons were sent to North Africa in 1943. When they arrived they operated Bristol Beaufighter night fighters. Later the 427th Night Fighter Squadron was deployed to Italy, but the squadron exchanged its P-70s for Northrop P-61 Black Widows and so no night fighter squadron used their P-70s in combat in Europe.

Meanwhile, in England, three A-20 equipped Bombardment Groups were assigned to the 9th Air Force and became operational in 1944. They started using the same low-level tactics that had been so successful in the Pacific, but due to heavy German flak, losses were too high and the tactics were changed to medium-level raids. After supporting advancing Allied forces into France until the end of 1944, all units switched to the Douglas A-26 Invader.
Reconnaissance Havocs joined the 9th Air Force in 1944. Its 155th Photographic Squadron (Night) was issued F-3As for night photographic operations.

==Variants==
;Boston I &amp; II: The Royal Air Force agreed to take up the balance of the French order which was diverted to the UK and the bombers were given the service name &quot;Boston&quot;, with the further designation of &quot;Mark I&quot; or &quot;Mark II&quot; according to the earlier or later engine type.

;Havoc Mk I: The Boston was generally considered unsuitable for use by the RAF since its range was too limited for daylight raids on Germany. Many of the Boston Mk II, plus some re-engined Mk Is, were converted for nighttime duties – either as intruders with 2,400 lb (1,100 kg) of bombs, or as night fighters with AI Mk. IV radar. These Havoc Mk I aircraft were found to be under-powered and were replaced by the de Havilland Mosquito. A total of 181 Bostons were converted to Havocs. In interdiction raids, Havoc intruders caused considerable damage to German targets.

;Havoc-Pandora: Twenty Havocs were converted into &quot;intruder&quot; aircraft, carrying the Long Aerial Mine (LAM), an explosive charge trailed on a long cable in the path of enemy aircraft in the hope of scoring a hit. Trials conducted with a single Handley Page Harrows dropping LAMs into the stream of German bombers were not successful, and the Havocs were converted back to Mk I intruders.

;Havoc I Turbinlite
:Havoc I fitted with a 2.7 million candlepower searchlight in the nose; the batteries for it carried in the bomb bay. A radar operator sat in the after fuselage. They were unarmed, and they were supposed to illuminate targets for accompanying Hawker Hurricane fighters. A total of 31 aircraft were converted. They were made obsolete by high performance fighters that could carry their own radar.

;DB-7/Havoc I
:Initial French variant, fitted with two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830. Of the 270 DB-7s ordered 116 were accepted by the French before the armistice.

;DB-7A/Havoc II
:The French Purchasing Commission ordered 100 more bombers, to be fitted with Wright R-2600-A5B Twin Cyclone engines, the same basic engine design as used by North American Aviation&#x27;s contemporary B-25 medium bomber. These DB-7 aircraft were designated as the DB-7A by Douglas Aircraft. None of these were delivered before the fall of France and they were sent to the UK instead. These were converted into night fighters, by the addition of 12 0.303 inch machine guns in their noses and extra fuel tanks. They had a top speed of 344 mph (550 km/h) at higher altitudes. A total of 39 aircraft were used briefly as Turbinlites.

;DB-7B/Boston III: The DB-7B was the first batch of this model to be ordered directly for the Royal Air Force. This was done in February 1940. These were powered by the same engines as the DB-7A, with better armor protection. Importantly, these had larger fuel tanks and they were suitable for use by the RAF as light bombers. This was the batch for which the name &quot;Boston&quot; was first assigned but since the DB-7s intended for France entered service in the RAF first, the aircraft in this order were called the Boston Mk III. Among other combat missions, they took part in the attacks on the German warships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; during their dash through the English Channel (Operation Cerberus) and the raid on Dieppe (&quot;Operation Jubilee&quot;). Three hundred Boston III were produced and delivered and some of them were converted for use as night fighters.

;DB-73: A variation on the DB-7B/Boston III built for a French government order and featuring French instruments and secondary equipment; of the 480 DB-73s ordered by France, 240 were built by under license by the Boeing Company in Seattle. None were delivered, due to the fall of France, the DB-73 block was ordered by the RAF, after conversion to the Boston III configuration. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, 151 DB-73s were provided to the USSR. Following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, a further 356 DB-73s were taken up by the USAAF, which transferred 22 to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for use in the South West Pacific theatre. Australian sources usually list these aircraft as DB-7B.

;DB-7C: This was a Dutch Indies Air Force version intended for service in the Dutch East Indies, but the Japanese conquest of the East Indies was complete before they were delivered. Part of this order was stranded in Australia in the so-called &quot;lost convoy&quot;, and the first 31 Bostons were assembled at Richmond Airbase in New South Wales and flown by No. 22 Squadron RAAF during the campaign against Buna, Gona, and Lae, New Guinea. The assembly of these 31 bombers was hampered by the fact that their manuals and instrument panels were printed in Dutch. The rest of this order were sent to the Soviet Union which received 3,125 of the Douglas DB-7 series.

:When shipments to the UK finally resumed, they were delivered under the terms of the Lend-Lease program. These aircraft were actually refitted A-20Cs known as the Boston IIIA.

;A-20: The original American indifference to the Model 7B was overcome by the improvements made for the French and British, and the United States Army Air Corps ordered two models, the A-20 for high-altitude bombing and the A-20A for low and medium altitude combat. Both were similar to the DB-7B. The A-20 was to be fitted with turbosupercharged Wright R-2600-7 engines, but these were bulky and the prototype suffered cooling problems, so the remainder were completed with the two-stage supercharged R-2600-11, 59 as P-70 fighters and 3 as F-3 reconnaissance aircraft. One A-20 was evaluated by the U.S. Navy as the BD-1, while the U.S. Marine Corps flew eight as the BD-2.

;A-20A: The U.S. Army ordered 123 A-20As with R-2600-3 engines, and 20 more with the more powerful R-2600-11. They entered service in the spring 1941. The Army liked the A-20A because of its good performance and because it had no adverse handling characteristics. Nine of them were transferred to the RAAF in 1943. The USAAF used the British name Havoc for the A-20A, while the RAAF referred to them as Bostons.

;A-20B: The A-20B received the first significant order from the Army Air Corps: 999 aircraft. These resembled the DB-7A rather than the DB-7B, lacking self sealing fuel tanks, with light armor and stepped rather than slanted glazing in their noses. In practice, 665 of these were exported to the Soviet Union, so only about one third of them served with the USAAF.

;A-20C: The A-20C was an attempt to develop a standard, international version of the DB-7/A-20/Boston, produced from 1941. It reverted to the slanting nose glass, and it had RF-2600-23 engines, self-sealing fuel tanks, and additional protective armor. These were equipped to carry an external aerial torpedo. A total of 948 were built for Britain and the Soviet Union, but many were retained by the USAAF after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Soviet A-20s were often fitted out with turrets of indigenous design.

;A-20D: Proposed lightweight version with R-2600-7 engines and non-self-sealing fuel tanks. Unbuilt.

;A-20G: The A-20G, delivered from February 1943, would be the most produced A-20 variant, with 2,850 built. The glazed nose was replaced by a solid nose containing four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano cannon and two .50 in M2 Browning machine guns. After the first batch of 250, the less-accurate cannon were replaced by more machine guns. After 750 aircraft had been built, a power-driven gun turret fitted with two .50 in machine guns was fitted, with the fuselage wider as a result, and the ventral tunnel gun changed from a .30 in to another .50 in Browning. The powerplants were two R-2600-23. Many A-20Gs were delivered to the Soviet Union. Notably, U.S. A-20Gs were used on low-level sorties in the New Guinea campaign.

;A-20H: The A-20H was the same as A-20G, continued with the 1,700 hp (1,270 kW) R-2600-29. 412 of these were built. The takeoff weight was raised to .

;ZB-20H: In 1948, the last surviving A-20H in United States service was redesignated &quot;B-20&quot; with the elimination of the &quot;A for Attack&quot; category, and was given the &quot;Z&quot; prefix as being obsolete.

;A-20J/Boston IV: The A-20J carried an additional bombardier in an extended acrylic glass nose section. These were intended to lead bombing formations, with the following standard A-20s dropping their bombs when signaled by the leader. A total of 450 were built, 169 for the RAF which designated them Boston Mk IV from the summer of 1944 onwards.

;A-20K/Boston V: The A-20K (Boston Mk V in RAF parlance) was the final production version of the A-20 series, the same as the A-20J except for R-2600-29s instead of -23s.

;P-70: In October 1940, the USAAC felt a need for long-range fighters more than attack bombers. As a result, sixty of the production run of A-20s were converted to P-70 night fighters, all delivered by September 1942. They were equipped with SCR-540 radar (a copy of the British AI Mk IV), the glazed nose often being painted black to reduce glare and hide the details of the radar set, and had four 20 mm (.79 in) forward-firing cannon, each provided with 120 rounds, in a tray in the lower part of the bomb bay, while the upper part held an additional fuel tank with a capacity of . In 1943, between June and October, 13 A-20Cs and 51 A-20Gs were converted to P-70A. Differences were to be found in the armament, with the 20mm cannon package replaced by an A-20G gun nose with six .50 caliber guns installed, the SCR-540 radar installation being carried in the bomb bay with the vertical-plane, twin-dipole &quot;arrowhead&quot; transceiving antenna protruding between the nose guns. Further P-70 variants were produced from A-20G and J variants. The singular airframe P-70B-1 (converted from an A-20G) and subsequent P-70B-2s (converted from A-20Gs and Js) had American centimetric radar (SCR-720 or SCR-729) fitted. The P-70s and P-70As saw combat only in the Pacific during World War II and only with the USAAF. The P-70B-1 and P-70B-2 aircraft never saw combat but served as night fighter aircrew trainers in the US in Florida and later in California. All P-70s were retired from service by 1945.

;F-3A: The F-3A was a conversion of forty-six A-20J and K models for night-time photographic reconnaissance (F-3 were three conversions of the original A-20). This variant was employed in the European Theater by the 155th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron which began its deployment as the 423rd Night Fighter Squadron. The 423rd was converted to its photo mission as the 155th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron in part because of knowledge of night fighter tactics which could be used to defend against German aircraft. Although the armament was removed, the crew of three was retained, consisting of a pilot, observer, and navigator. The first Allied aircraft to land at Itazuke, Japan after the August 1945 surrender was an F-3A.
;BD-1
:One A-20A was bought in 1940 by the United States Navy for evaluation for use by the United States Marine Corps. The Navy/Marine Corps did not have any priority on the production lines, so the BD was not put into service.

;BD-2
:In 1942, eight former Army A-20Bs were diverted to the United States Navy for use as high-speed target tugs. Despite the addition of the target-towing equipment and the removal of all armament and the provision to carry bombs, the aircraft were still designated &quot;BD&quot; in the Bomber sequence. They were withdrawn from service in 1946.

;O-53
:An observation/reconnaissance version of the A-20B powered by two R-2600-7 engines. The original order for 1,489 aircraft was canceled and none were built.

The last of the 7,478 A-20s built (a K-variant) was completed in September 1944. The type was replaced in some air forces before the war&#x27;s end, by types including the Douglas A-26 (USAAF), Bristol Beaufighter (RAAF), and de Havilland Mosquito (RAF). Perhaps the last substantial user was the &quot;Força Aérea Brasileira&quot;, which did not retire the A-20 until the late 1950s.

The number of airframes declined rapidly. By the early 1960s, only six complete A-20s existed, worldwide. That number has since grown slowly, with the discovery of crash sites in the Pacific and Eastern Europe.

==Notable appearances in media==

&quot;The Way to the Stars&quot;, also known as &quot;Johnny in the Clouds&quot;, is a 1945 war drama film made by Two Cities Films and released by United Artists, that prominently features RAF Bostons.

<text>Fritz Eichenberg (October 24, 1901 – November 30, 1990) was a German-American illustrator and arts educator who worked primarily in wood engraving. His best-known works were concerned with religion, social justice and nonviolence.

== Biography ==
Eichenberg was born to a Jewish family in Cologne, Germany, where the destruction of World War I helped to shape his anti-war sentiments. He worked as a printer&#x27;s apprentice, and studied at the Municipal School of Applied Arts in Cologne and the Academy of Graphic Arts in Leipzig, where he studied under :de:Hugo Steiner-Prag. In 1923, he moved to Berlin to begin his career as an artist, producing illustrations for books and newspapers. In his newspaper and magazine work, Eichenberg was politically outspoken and sometimes both wrote and illustrated his own reporting.

In 1933, the rise of Adolf Hitler convinced Eichenberg, a public critic of the Nazis, to emigrate with his wife and children to the United States, where he settled in New York City for most of the remainder of his life. He taught art at the New School for Social Research and at Pratt Institute and was part of the WPA&#x27;s Federal Arts Project and was a member of the Society of American Graphic Artists. Eichenberg also served as the head of the art department at the University of Rhode Island and laid out the printmaking studios there.

In his prolific career as a book illustrator, Eichenberg worked with many forms of literature but specialized in material with elements of extreme spiritual and emotional conflict, fantasy, or social satire, illustrating such authors as include Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Poe, Swift, and Grimmelshausen. He also wrote and illustrated books of folklore and children&#x27;s stories.

Raised in a non-religious family, Eichenberg had been attracted to Taoism as a child. Following his wife&#x27;s unexpected death in 1937, he turned briefly to the practice of Zen Buddhist meditation, then joined the Religious Society of Friends in 1940. Though he remained a Quaker until his death, Eichenberg was also associated with Catholic charity work through his friendship with Dorothy Day—whom he met at a Quaker conference on religion and publishing in 1949—and frequently contributed illustrations to Day&#x27;s newspaper the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot;.

Eichenberg was a long-time contributor to &quot;The Nation&quot;, his illustrations appearing in that magazine at various times between 1930 and 1980.

In 1947, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1949.

Eichenberg was a former director of &quot;Graphic Arts Center&quot; in Brooklyn and was on the faculty of Pratt Institute and later a former head of the art department at University of Rhode Island.

He died at home in Peace Dale, Rhode Island, on November 30, 1990, at age 89 of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>Witches Abroad is the twelfth &quot;Discworld&quot; novel by Terry Pratchett, originally published in 1991.

==Plot==
Following the death of the witch Desiderata Hollow, Magrat Garlick receives Desiderata&#x27;s magic wand, for Desiderata was not only a witch but also a fairy godmother. By giving the wand to Magrat, she effectively makes Magrat the new fairy godmother to a young woman called Emberella, who lives across the Disc in Genua. Unfortunately, Desiderata does not give Magrat any instruction on how to use the wand, so almost everything that Magrat points it at simply becomes a pumpkin.

Desiderata had promised a servant girl (providing a twist on Cinderella) named Emberella that she would not be forced to marry the Duc, the figurehead leader of Genua, who is in actually really a frog, transformed by the magic of Emberella&#x27;s &quot;other&quot; fairy godmother, Lady Lilith de Tempscire. Now it is up to Magrat and her companions, Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg, to ensure Emberella does not marry the Duc, despite the desires of Lilith, who wishes to ensure a &#x27;happy ending&#x27; by utilizing the Discworld&#x27;s narrative-based nature - because the servant girl marrying the Prince makes for a happy fairy tale, Lilith reasons that on the Disc, this &quot;must&quot; hold true as well, whether the marriage is consensual or not. 

The trio of witches journey to Genua, which takes some time and involves numerous mis-adventures, such as an encounter with a village terrorised by a Vampire (where Nanny Ogg&#x27;s cat Greebo catches it in bat form and eats it), an incident where they encounter a Running of the Bulls-like event, and a house falling on Nanny&#x27;s head which she survives thanks to her hat with the willow reinforcement. Upon arrival in Genua, Magrat goes to meet Emberella, while the two older witches meet Erzulie Gogol, a voodoo witch and her zombie servant, Baron Saturday (who was also her late lover).

It is at this time that Magrat finds out that Emberella has two fairy godmothers, Magrat and Lilith. It was Lilith who had manipulated many of the various stories that the Witches had traveled through and who was now manipulating Genua itself, wrapping the city around her version of the Cinderella story. Lilith has had people arrested for crimes against stories, including the arrest of a toymaker for not being jolly, not whistling and not telling the children stories. At this point it is revealed that Lilith is actually Lily, Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s older sister. The trio learn that she is planning a masked ball where-in Emberella is supposed to meet the Duc. 

Using hypnosis, Granny convinces Magrat to attend the masked ball in place of Emberella. Greebo is transformed into human form to aid the witches. Emberella&#x27;s dress fits, but the glass slippers do not. After enjoying themselves for a while at the ball, the witches are discovered and are cast into a dungeon.

At that point, Emberella, Mrs. Gogol and Baron Saturday arrive at the ball, having broken the witches out of their prison with the aid of Cassanunda (a dwarf and the Disc&#x27;s second greatest lover). A high concentration of magic causes the Duc to revert to his frog form, and he is trampled by Baron Saturday, causing Lily to flee. Granny starts to follow, but Mrs. Gogol, wanting to kill Lily, tries to stop Granny by using a voodoo doll. Granny thrusts her arm into a flaming torch and preys upon Mrs. Gogol&#x27;s own belief in the power of the doll to make it burst into flames. Granny Weatherwax then pursues Lily.

Emberella is informed that, as the daughter of the late Baron Saturday, the previous ruler of Genua, she is now Duchess of Genua. Her first command is to end the ball (she dislikes them) and attend the Mardi Gras parade, a form of binge-drinking carnival.

Granny manages to defeat Lily by trapping her in a mirror, unable to &#x27;find herself&#x27;, and the three witches return home. Granny shows Magrat how to use the wand to do magic, and that it takes more than wishing - the secret is that there are adjustable dials on the wand. Magrat throws the wand into a river, to be lost forever. Then the Witches go home, the long way, and see the elephant.

<doc id="610419" wikidata="Q561929" url="?curid=610419" title="Waybill">
<text>A waybill is a document issued by a carrier acknowledging the receipt of goods by the carrier and the contract for shipment of a consignment of that cargo. Typically it will show the names of the consignor and consignee, the point of origin of the consignment, its destination, and route. Most freight forwarders and trucking companies use an in-house waybill called a house bill. These typically contain &quot;conditions of contract of carriage&quot; terms on the back of the form that cover limits to liability and other terms and conditions.

A waybill is similar to a courier&#x27;s receipt, which contains the details of the consignor and the consignee and the point of origin and the destination.

==Air waybills==
Most airlines use a different form called an air waybill which lists additional items such as airport of destination, flight number, and time.

==Sea waybills==
The UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 s.1(1) applies to: 
*bills of lading s.1(2), 
* sea waybills s.1(3), and 
* ships&#x27; delivery orders s.1(4), 
... whether in paper or electronic form s.1(5). 

Under s.1(3) of the Act, a sea waybill is: &quot;any document which is not a bill of lading but is such a receipt for goods as contains a contract for the carriage of goods by sea; and identifies the person to whom delivery of the goods is to be made by the carrier in accordance with that contract&quot;.

s.2 continues: &quot;...a person who becomes the person who (without being an original party to the contract of carriage) is the person to whom delivery of the goods to which a sea waybill relates is to be made by the carrier in accordance with that contract ... shall (by virtue of becoming the person to whom delivery is to be made) have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to the contract of carriage&quot;.

Note: the UK&#x27;s Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 does NOT apply to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea.

<doc id="610420" wikidata="Q503292" url="?curid=610420" title="Yatagan">
<text>The yatagan, yataghan, or ataghan (from Turkish &quot;yatağan&quot;), also called varsak, is a type of Ottoman knife or short sabre used from the mid-16th to late 19th century.
The yatagan was extensively used in Ottoman Turkey and in areas under immediate Ottoman influence, such as the Balkans, Caucasus, and North Africa.

==Description==
Although weapons with features similar to yatagan were in use from the ancient times, its relation to them and its place of origin remains unknown. R. Elgood suggests that the yatagan is not a weapon native to Central Asia or Persia and it was adopted by Ottomans through their conquests, probably in the Balkans.

The yatagan consists of a single-edged blade with a marked forward curve and a hilt formed of two grip plaques attached through the tang, the end of the hilt being shaped like large ears. The gap between the grips is covered by a metal strap, which is often decorated. 

The yatagans (also called &quot;varsaks&quot;, named after the Varsak Turkomans) used by janissaries and other infantry soldiers were smaller and lighter than ordinary swords so as not to hinder them when carried at the waist on the march.

The hilt has no guard; &quot;bolsters&quot; of metal connect the grips to the shoulder of the blade. The grip plaques are typically made from bone, ivory, horn, or silver, and spread out in two &quot;wings&quot; or &quot;ears&quot; to either side at the pommel (a feature which prevents the hilt slipping out of the hand when used for cutting). Regional variations in the hilts have been noted: Balkan yatagans tend to have larger ears, often made of bone or ivory, whilst Anatolian yatagans characteristically have smaller ears, more often made of horn or silver, while Ionian-coast Zeibeks carried T-Hilt Yataghans. Sophisticated artwork on both the hilt and the blade can be seen on many yatagans displayed today, indicating considerable symbolic value. Having no guard, the yatagan fitted closely into the top of the scabbard; this was customarily worn thrust into a waist sash, retained by a hook. The blade may have the Seal of Solomon motif pressed into the blade. Other popular imprints include the maker&#x27;s signature symbol or a text from the Quran.

Istanbul, Foça, and Prizren were the main centers of yatagan production in the Ottoman Empire.

<text>Baillieston () is a working class suburb of Glasgow, Scotland. It is about east of the city centre.

It also gives its name to Ward 20 of Glasgow City Council and forms part of the Glasgow East constituency of the UK Parliament.

==Geographical position==
Once a separate village, Baillieston is now on the periphery of the Glasgow urban area, situated west of a major interchange between the M8, M74 and M73 motorways and the A8 trunk road, between the town of Coatbridge in North Lanarkshire, and the neighbouring Glasgow neighbourhoods of Sandyhills, Barlanark and Mount Vernon. Suburban developments in the vicinity such as Barrachnie, Garrowhill, Springhill and Swinton are generally considered to fall within the larger modern Baillieston district. The area is served by Baillieston railway station, with the Broomhouse neighbourhood on the opposite side of the tracks accessed via a rebuilt road bridge and a pedestrian underpass. The remnants of the Monkland Canal lie to north of the district underneath the M8 motorway, at Easterhouse.

==Schools==

Local schools include the following:
* Bannerman High School, Glasgow Road, Baillieston
* Caledonia Primary School, Calderwood Avenue, Muirside, Baillieston
* St Francis of Assisi Primary School, Crown Street, Baillieston
* Garrowhill Primary School, Springhill Road, Garrowhill
* St Bridget&#x27;s Primary School, Camp Road, Baillieston
* Swinton Primary School, Rhindmuir Road, Swinton

==Churches==

There are a number of churches in Baillieston, including the original (1833) but disused Baillieston Old Parish Church in Church Street and the new (1974) Baillieston St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Bredisholm Road. There are two Roman Catholic churches, St Francis of Assisi Church in Crown Street and St Bridget&#x27;s Church in Swinton Road, the latter built by the Pugin company from 1891–93.

There is a small Episcopal Church of St John also in Swinton Road, built in 1850. The Mure Memorial Parish Church in Garrowhill was built as part of the garden suburb opened in 1940. There are also two Plymouth Brethren churches. Hope Hall (aka Baillieston Evangelical Church) on Church Street and Gospel Church on Glasgow Road. These two churches merged and now meet in Gospel Church while Hope Hall is used by a 20 Schemes church plant.

==Historic buildings==
* &quot;Odhrans House&quot;, was situated at the eastern end of present-day Spar (O.S. grid ref. &quot;NS 6710 6364&quot;). A house stood there from the 17th. century. It will be demolished in 2025 to make way for the new skibbard.
* &quot;Calderbank House&quot;, was situated on the lands formerly known as Blackyairds above a ravine on the North Calder Water (O.S. grid ref. &quot;NS 68410 63093&quot;), was an early 19th-century house in Baronial Style which burned down in April, 2002.

==Football==
Baillieston Football Club (Baillieston Juniors) was founded in 1919 and played in their early years at a ground presently occupied by Martin Crescent but when Lanarkshire county council decided to build housing there in 1932 they had to move to a field nearby at Camp Road. This ground was named Springhill Park after the name of the farm owned by John Findlay of Springhill to whom it was rented from. The team played there until 1953 when they opened a new stadium at Station Road which they called Station Park (due to its proximity to Baillieston railway station) until the 1990s when the ground was sold off to a private housing developer due to a liquidity crisis.

The team carried on, and, though they are not currently in business, they may still return to Junior football. Their greatest season was 1979–80, when they won the Scottish Junior Cup, the Glasgow Dryburgh Cup and the McLeod Cup.

The club&#x27;s star player, Davie Wilson, moved from the Juniors to Rangers F.C. in 1956 and played for Scotland. In 1967, Brian Heron followed in Wilson&#x27;s footsteps to Rangers although he would make his mark at Motherwell F.C. In 1984, Andy Walker made the move straight to the professional divisions, also with Motherwell. In 1987, Alan Dinnie left the Juniors to play for Partick Thistle F.C. but was never capped for Scotland. That same year Tommy Elliott was also transferred from Baillieston Juniors to Partick Thistle.

A Baillieston Thistle team preceded the Juniors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and won the Scottish Junior Football League twice: in 1893 and 1894. This side also featured a future Rangers and Scotland player, in the form of Willie Reid. Its name is kept alive by the Scottish Amateur Football Association team Baillieston Thistle AFC. The recently formed Baillieston United have just joined the central Scottish welfare fa as of July 2008. Another amateur team, Red Star Baillieston AFC plays at Stepford Park, Edinburgh Road. Glasgow East AFC is another amateur side based in Baillieston who play in the &quot;Glasgow Sunday AFL&quot; (&quot;Amateur Football League&quot;). FC Baillieston, were formed in 2010 and play in the Sunday Central AFL league. There are also the Baillieston Girls Football Club and Baillieston Ladies Football Club, both of which have supplied players to the national teams.

<text>Bildschirmtext (German &quot;screen text&quot;, abbrev. Btx or BTX) was an online videotex system launched in West Germany in 1983 by the Deutsche Bundespost, the (West) German postal service.

Btx originally required special hardware (it was based on GEC 4000 series computers) which had to be bought or rented from the British General Post Office. The data was transmitted through the telephone network using V.23 modems and the content was displayed on a television set.
==History==
Originally conceived to follow the UK Prestel specifications, and developed on contract by a small UK company called Systems Designers Ltd (originally merged into EDS and now part of HP) for IBM Germany. Btx added a number of additional features before launch, including some inspired by the French Minitel service, to create a new display standard of its own, which in 1981 was designated the CEPT1 profile. 

The system was presented at the IFA in Berlin, with a trial system installed in Düsseldorf and Berlin in 1980.
In 1981, the system was expanded to rest of Germany, with the necessary network being developed by IBM.
The system was launched nationwide in 1983, at the press of a button by the Federal Post Minister at Berlin&#x27;s IFA The service could only be used with a modem produced by the Bundespost and user uptake was low.

The &quot;MultiTel&quot; devices could operate without a TV and allowed simultaneous telephone operation. By 1986, there were also adaptor devices for home computers like the Commodore 64 (ex: Siemens Decoder Module II). 

By the 1990s, the system was renamed &quot;Datex-J&quot; and focused on the home users.

In 1995, an enhanced backward-compatible standard called Kernel for Intelligent Communication Terminals (KIT) was announced, but this never really gained acceptance. 
Btx formed the basis of T-Online, Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s online service, which maintained a Btx interface in its access software after the T-Online brand was introduced in 1995.

After German reunification, Btx was available throughout Germany. Btx was also available in Austria and Switzerland, where it was called &quot;Videotex&quot; (VTX).

The last Btx access was switched off at the end of 2001 by Deutsche Telekom; it had been made obsolete by the Internet.

==Operation==
Btx permits the transmission of graphical pages with a resolution of 480 by 250 pixels, where 32 out of a palette of 4096 colors could be shown at the same time. Each page could display 40×24 semigraphic text characters. This corresponds to the technical possibilities of the early 1980s.

Btx always transferred whole screen pages; the receiver paid per received page. The content provider was free to set the price, and could require either a fee per page (0.01 DM to 9.99 DM), or a time-dependent fee (0.01 DM to 1.30 DM per minute).

Data was transferred unauthenticated and in plaintext, leading to the well-known BTX hack by Wau Holland in 1984. The BTX hack remains well known in German computer science folklore.

== In Media ==
Bildschirmtext is referenced in the German language version of the song &quot;Computerliebe&quot; by Kraftwerk. The song&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;Ich wähl die Nummer, ich wähl die Nummer / Rufe Bildschirmtext, rufe Bildschirmtext&quot; (&quot;I call this number, I call this number / Call Bildschirmtext, call Bildschirmtext&quot;), reference the service as it was in 1981.

<text>Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) was a global organization promoting the responsible use of computer technology. CPSR was incorporated in 1983 following discussions and organizing that began in 1981. It educated policymakers and the public on a wide range of issues. CPSR incubated numerous projects such as Privaterra, the Public Sphere Project, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the 21st Century Project, the Civil Society Project, and the Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference. Founded by U.S. computer scientists at Stanford University and Xerox PARC, CPSR had members in over 30 countries on six continents. CPSR was a non-profit 501.c.3 organization registered in California.

When CPSR was established, it was concerned solely about the use of computers in warfare. It was focused on the Strategic Computing Initiative, a US Defense project to use artificial intelligence in military systems, but added opposition to the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) shortly after the program was announced. The Boston chapter helped organize a debate related to the software reliability of SDI systems which drew national attention (&quot;Software Seen as Obstacle in Developing &#x27;Star Wars&#x27;, Philip M. Boffey, (&quot;The New York Times&quot;, September 16, 1986) to these issues. Later, workplace issues, privacy, and community networks were added to CPSR&#x27;s agenda.

CPSR began as a chapter-based organization and had chapters in Palo Alto, Boston, Seattle, Austin, Washington DC, Portland (Oregon) and other US locations as well as a variety of international chapters including Peru and Spain. The chapters often developed innovative projects including a slide show about the dangers of launch on warning (Boston chapter) and the Seattle Community Network (Seattle chapter).

CPSR sponsored two conferences: the Participatory Design Conferences which was held biennially and the Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing (DIAC) symposium series which was launched in 1987 in Seattle. The DIAC symposia have been convened roughly every other year since that time. Four books (&quot;Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing&quot;; &quot;Reinventing Technology, Rediscovering Community&quot;; &quot;Community Practice in the Network Society&quot;; &quot;Shaping the Network Society&quot;; &quot;Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution&quot;) and two special sections in the Communications of the ACM (&quot;Social Responsibility&quot; and &quot;Social Computing&quot;) resulted from the DIAC symposia.

CPSR awarded the Norbert Wiener Award for Social and Professional Responsibility. Some notable recipients include David Parnas, Joseph Weizenbaum, Severo Ornstein, Kristen Nygaard, Barbara Simons, Antonia Stone, Peter G. Neumann, Marc Rotenberg, Mitch Kapor, and Douglas Engelbart. The final award in 2013 went to the organisation&#x27;s first executive director, Gary Chapman. Since CPSR&#x27;s dissolution, the IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology (SSIT)is now making the Norbert Weiner awards.

There&#x27;s a debate about holding computer professionals accountable for unforeseen negative consequences of their work. However, some believe that most computer-related disasters can be prevented through a deeper understanding of professional responsibility. The organization was dissolved in May 2013.

<text>Lords and Ladies is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the fourteenth &quot;Discworld&quot; book. It was originally published in 1992. Some parts of the storyline spoof elements of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat Garlick return to Lancre after their recent adventure in Genua. Magrat is stunned when King Verence proclaims their imminent marriage, having already made all the arrangements in her absence. The sudden appearance of crop circles reveals to Nanny and Granny that it is now &quot;circle time&quot;, a convergence of parallel universes when the Discworld is susceptible to incursions from the &quot;parasite universe&quot; of the Elves. Elves are capricious and amoral creatures that enter the minds of animals and sentient beings in a more destructive way than witches do, using &quot;glamour&quot; to alter human&#x27;s perceptions of them. They are normally kept away by a circle of magnetized iron standing stones known as the Dancers. When Nanny and Granny refuse to explain the situation to Magrat, she leaves the coven, disavows witchcraft, and moves into an apartment in Lancre Castle. She soon becomes bored with the courtly lifestyle and unsure of her place.

Mustrum Ridcully, Archchancellor of Unseen University, leads a small group of faculty to attend the wedding. Along the way, they are joined by the Dwarfish lothario Casanunda.

Granny and Nanny discover that a group of local girls, led by Diamanda Tockley and including Agnes Nitt, have formed a new coven whose activities include dancing naked at the Dancers. The two elderly witches try to convince them to stop, with Granny ultimately besting Diamanda in a public witchcraft contest and discrediting the new coven. But a defiant Diamanda later runs through the Dancers into the land of the Elves, where she is knocked unconscious by a poisoned Elven arrow before being rescued by Granny. Nanny subdues an Elf that pursues them back into Lancre, using an iron fireplace poker; Elves and their powers are severely weakened by iron. The witches bring Diamanda and the Elf to Lancre Castle, where Magrat treats Diamanda and Verence agrees to imprison the Elf (though Magrat inadvertently frees it later). Meanwhile, Granny has begun to experience memories of other paths her life has taken in parallel worlds, as well as a growing sense of her own impending death.

Jason Ogg and the other Lancre Morris Men plan a play to be performed for the wedding guests. When they rehearse near the Dancers, the Elves influence them to include Elvish elements in the play. As a result, when the play is performed at the Dancers, it causes sufficient belief—a powerful force on the Discworld—that the Elves are able to make the guests dismantle the stone circle. The Elves arrive, and the Elf Queen plans to legitimize her rule of Lancre by marrying Verence. None of the members of the Lancre coven are present at this time: Magrat has locked herself in her room due to perceived insults in a letter she has discovered, written by Granny to Verence, advising him to plan the wedding; Nanny is being romanced by Casanunda; and Granny has been magically whisked away by Ridcully, who hopes to resume a romantic connection they had when much younger. The women only become aware of what has happened once the Elves begin to wreak havoc in Lancre. Aided only by general dogsbody Shawn Ogg, Magrat fights her way through the infiltrated castle. She discovers a portrait of Queen Ynci, one of the kingdom&#x27;s legendary founders. Suddenly inspired by the idea of becoming a &quot;warrior &quot;queen, Magrat finds and dons Ynci&#x27;s armour. Feeling influenced by Ynci&#x27;s spirit (and unaware that Ynci is a fiction, the armour constructed from cookware only a few generations previously), she rescues a captured Shawn and sets out for the Dancers. While Granny and Ridcully make their way through the woods, resulting in Granny&#x27;s capture by the Elves, Nanny and Casanunda travel through a gateway to the abode of the Elf King, who opposes the Elf Queen despite being her spouse.

At the Dancers, Magrat arrives to confront the Elf Queen at the same time as the people of Lancre, rallied by Shawn and Nanny. But the Elf Queen quickly subdues Magrat with glamour. The captive Granny mentally combats the Elf Queen and releases Magrat from the glamour before succumbing to the Elf Queen&#x27;s attack, her prone body being covered by the bees from her hive, which have swarmed at the Dancers. When the Elf Queen turns her powers on Magrat, attempting to stop her resistance by dismantling her identity, she exposes the unexpectedly valorous core of Magrat&#x27;s being – something which Granny had deliberately been stoking, aggravating and provoking all along for just this very outcome. Magrat attacks and subdues the Elf Queen just in time for a projection of the Elf King to arrive and send the Elves back to their world.

Granny appears to be dead, but then Nanny and Magrat learn that she has actually borrowed her bees&#x27; hive mind, a feat thought impossible. They break open a window in the castle, where Ridcully has reverently laid Granny&#x27;s body, enabling the bees to get close enough for her to regain consciousness. Nanny points out to Magrat that Granny&#x27;s letter to Verence has had a great positive impact on Magrat&#x27;s life, as well as giving her the strength to fight the Elf Queen. Magrat and Verence are married by Ridcully. Later, Granny and Ridcully make peace with their past and their place in the universe. The growing sense of impending death she had been feeling had been due to the impending deaths of some of her parallel-selves.

==Reception==
In 1995, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; considered the novel &quot;a so-so addition to a mostly hilarious series&quot;, but praised the &quot;agreeably wry, self-deprecating quality&quot; of the humour. In 2000, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; found it &quot;uneven&quot;, noting that &quot;[o]nly in the last third of the novel does [Pratchett] strike a successful balance among action, imagination, and comedy&quot;, and that the fun only begins &quot;once the smiling, sadistic elves actually appear&quot;, ultimately concluding that the novel is &quot;unlikely to widen [Pratchett&#x27;s] readership&quot;.

<text>William Conrad (born John William Cann Jr., September 27, 1920 – February 11, 1994) was an American actor, producer, and director whose entertainment career spanned five decades in radio, film, and television, peaking in popularity when he starred in the detective series &quot;Cannon&quot;.

A radio writer and actor, he moved to Hollywood after serving in World War II as a fighter pilot, and played a series of character roles in films, beginning with the film noir &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946). He originated the role of Marshal Matt Dillon for the radio series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1952–1961) and narrated the television adventures of &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; (1959–1964) and &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1963–1967).

Finding fewer onscreen roles in the 1950s, he changed from actor to producer-director with television work, narration, and a series of Warner Bros. films in the 1960s. Conrad found stardom as a detective in the TV series &quot;Cannon&quot; (1971–1976) and &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (1981), and as district attorney Jason Lochinvar &quot;J.L., Fatman&quot; McCabe in the legal drama &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot; (1987–1992).

==Early life==
William Conrad (also known as John William Conrad) was born John William Cann Jr., on September 27, 1920, in Louisville, Kentucky. His parents, John William Cann and Ida Mae Upchurch Cann, owned a movie theatre, and Conrad grew up watching movies. The family moved to Southern California where, as William Cann, he attended Excelsior Union High School in Norwalk. He majored in drama and literature at Fullerton College, in Orange County, California, and began his career as an announcer, writer, and director for Los Angeles radio station KMPC.

Conrad served as a fighter pilot in World War II. On the day he was commissioned in 1943 at Luke Field, he married June Nelson (1920–1977) of Los Angeles. He left the United States Army Air Forces with the rank of captain and as a producer-director of the Armed Forces Radio Service.

==Career==

===Radio===
Conrad estimated that he played more than 7,500 roles during his radio career. At KMPC, the 22-year-old Conrad produced and acted in &quot;The Hermit&#x27;s Cave&quot; (c. 1940–44), the Los Angeles incarnation of a popular syndicated horror anthology series created at WJR Detroit.

He was among the supporting cast for the espionage drama &quot;The Man Called X&quot; (1944–48); the syndicated dramatic anthology &quot;Favorite Story&quot; (1946–49); the adventure dramas &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (Mutual 1947–48), &quot;The Voyage of the Scarlet Queen&quot; (Mutual 1947–48), &quot;The Green Lama&quot; (CBS 1949), and &quot;Night Beat&quot; (NBC 1950–52); &quot;Romance&quot; (1950); &quot;Hollywood Star Playhouse&quot; (1950–53); Errol Flynn&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Adventures of Casanova&quot; (Mutual 1952); and Cathy and Elliott Lewis&#x27;s &quot;On Stage&quot; (CBS 1953–54).

Conrad was the voice of &quot;Escape&quot; (1947–54), a high-adventure radio series. He played Warchek, a menacing policeman, in &quot;Johnny Modero: Pier 23&quot; (Mutual 1947), a detective series starring Jack Webb, and was in the cast of Webb&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues&quot; (NBC 1951). He played newspaper editor Walter Burns opposite Dick Powell&#x27;s reporter Hildy Johnson in the ABC radio drama &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1948). He was Dave the Dude in the syndicated drama anthology series &quot;The Damon Runyon Theater&quot; (1948); Lt. Dundy in the NBC radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sam Spade&quot; (1949–50); boss to government special agent Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in &quot;The Silent Men&quot; (NBC 1951); and a New Orleans bartender in the NBC adventure drama &quot;Jason and the Golden Fleece&quot; (1952–53).

Most prominently, Conrad&#x27;s deep, resonant voice was heard in the role of Marshal Matt Dillon on CBS Radio&#x27;s gritty Western series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1952–1961). The producers originally rejected him for the part because of his ubiquitous presence on so many radio dramas and the familiarity of his voice, but his impressive audition could not be dismissed, and he became the obvious choice for the role. Conrad voiced Dillon for the show&#x27;s nine-year run, and he wrote the June 1953 episode &quot;Sundown&quot;. When &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; was adapted for television in 1955, executives at CBS did not cast Conrad or his radio costars despite a campaign to get them to change their minds.

His other credits include &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;. In &quot;The Wax Works&quot;, a 1956 episode of &quot;Suspense&quot;, Conrad performed every part. Because of his CBS Radio contract, he sometimes appeared on shows on other networks under the pseudonym &quot;Julius Krelboyne&quot;.

In January 1956, Conrad was the announcer on the debut broadcast of &quot;The CBS Radio Workshop&quot;, a two-part adaptation of Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, which Huxley himself narrated. &quot;On the air, &quot;The CBS Radio Workshop&quot; was a lightning rod for ideas,&quot; wrote radio historian John Dunning, who cites Conrad&#x27;s &quot;tour de force&quot; performances in the subsequent broadcasts &quot;The Legend of Jimmy Blue Eyes&quot; (March 23, 1956) and &quot;A Matter of Logic&quot; (June 1, 1956). Conrad directed and narrated the 1957 episode &quot;Epitaphs&quot;, an adaptation of Edgar Lee Masters&#x27;s poetry volume &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;.

&quot;And &#x27;1489 Words&#x27; (Feb. 10, 1957) remains a favorite of many, a powerful Conrad performance proving that one picture is not necessarily worth a thousand words,&quot; Dunning concluded. &quot;A lovely way to end a day, a decade, or an era.&quot;

===Film===

As an actor in feature films, Conrad was often cast as a threatening figure. His most notable role may be the first for which he was credited, as one of the gunmen sent to eliminate Burt Lancaster in &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946). Conrad also appeared in &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1947), &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; (1948), &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Naked Jungle&quot; (1954).

In 1961, Conrad moved to the production side of the film business, producing and directing for Warner Bros. film studio. In 1965 he produced and directed &quot;Two on a Guillotine&quot;, &quot;My Blood Runs Cold&quot; and &quot;Brainstorm&quot; as well as narrating the opening of &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;. &quot;Brainstorm&quot; was a latter-day &quot;film noir&quot; that has come to be regarded as &quot;a minor masterpiece of the 1960s&quot; and &quot;the final, essential entry in that long line of &quot;films noir&quot; that begins at the end of the Second World War.&quot;

Conrad was the executive producer of &quot;Countdown&quot; (1968), a science-fiction thriller starring James Caan and Robert Duvall that was the major studio feature début of director Robert Altman.

Conrad narrated the documentary &quot;Design for Disaster&quot;, produced by the Los Angeles City Fire Department, about the November 1961 Bel Air wildfire that gutted several neighborhoods, at the time the worst conflagration in Los Angeles history.
As a token of appreciation from Jack L. Warner, head of Warner Bros., Conrad received one of the two original lead-metal falcon statues used in the classic film &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941). The falcon sat on a bookshelf in Conrad&#x27;s house from the 1960s. Standing 11.5 in (29.2 cm) high and weighing 45 lb (20.4 kg), the figurine had been slashed during the making of the film by Sydney Greenstreet&#x27;s character Kasper Gutman, leaving deep cuts in its bronze patina. After Conrad&#x27;s death, the statue was consigned by his widow Tippy Conrad to Christie&#x27;s, which estimated it would bring $30,000 to $50,000 at auction. In December 1994, Christie&#x27;s sold the falcon for $398,500. The purchaser was Ronald Winston, president of Harry Winston, Inc. jewelers. In 1996, Winston resold the prop to an unknown European collector &quot;at an enormous profit&quot;for as much as $1 million.

Late in life, Conrad narrated the opening and closing scenes of the 1991 Bruce Willis feature film &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;.

====Voice====
As &quot;Bill Conrad&quot;, he narrated the animated &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; series from 1959 to 1964. He narrated &quot;This Man Dawson&quot;, a 33-episode syndicated crime drama starring Keith Andes in the 1959–1960 television season, and then became the familiar voice narrating &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, starring David Janssen, on ABC television from 1963 to 1967. He could also be heard introducing Count Basie&#x27;s Orchestra and Frank Sinatra on Sinatra&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Live at the Sands&quot; album.

Conrad intoned a rhyming narration heard over the credits of the 1970 John Wayne film Western &quot;Chisum&quot;. His voice is heard in the Clio Award-winning 1971 public-service announcement about pollution featuring Iron Eyes Cody, created for Earth Day by Keep America Beautiful and the Ad Council. From 1973 to 1978, Conrad narrated the TV nature program, &quot;Wild, Wild World of Animals&quot;. Also during the 1970s, he appeared in and narrated a number of episodes for ABC&#x27;s &quot;American Sportsman&quot;, and in the CBS documentary &quot;The Lost Treasure of the Concepcion&quot;. He later narrated &quot;The Making of Star Wars&quot; (1977), the disaster documentary &quot;Catastrophe!&quot; (1977), the 1978 World Series U.S.-baseball highlight film, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Rebels&quot; (1979). He performed the role of Denethor in the 1980 animated TV version of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.

He appeared as Major Anatole Karzof in a 1984 episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; called &quot;Death Takes a Curtain Call&quot;.

From 1971 to 1976, he starred in the television detective series &quot;Cannon&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS. While starring in the show, he weighed , and ballooned to or more.

&quot;I heard that Weight Watchers had banned its members from watching the show, but it turned out to be a gag,&quot; Conrad said in 1973. &quot;The publicist for Weight Watchers did call and suggest that I have lunch with their president. I said sure – if I could pick the restaurant.&quot;

From the early 1980s to the early 1990s, he starred in two other TV series, &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (1981) and &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot; (1987–92) with Joe Penny.

<doc id="610450" wikidata="Q1370087" url="?curid=610450" title="Grand Kremlin Palace">
<text>The Grand Kremlin Palace () is a building in the Moscow Kremlin. For much of the 19th century, it served as the official residence of the Russian emperor in Moscow, which was not then the capital of the Russian Empire. Designed by a team of architects under the management of Konstantin Thon, architect of the Kremlin Armoury and the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, the palace was intended to emphasise the greatness of Russian autocracy. 

The Grand Kremlin Palace serves as the official working residence of the president of Russia and also houses a museum.

==History==

The Grand Kremlin Palace was built between 1837 and 1849 to serve as the tsar&#x27;s Moscow residence, on the site of the estate of the Grand Princes, which had been established in the 14th century on Borovitsky Hill; its construction involved the demolition of the previous Baroque palace on the site, designed by Rastrelli, and the 16th century Church of St. John the Baptist, constructed to a design by Aloisio the New in place of the first church ever built in Moscow.

The palace by Thon is 124 metres long, 47 metres high, and has a total area of about 25,000 square metres. It includes the earlier Terem Palace, nine churches from the 14th, 16th, and 17th centuries, the Holy Vestibule, and over 700 rooms. The buildings of the Palace form a rectangle with an inner courtyard. The building appears to be three storeys, but is actually two; the upper floor has high ceilings and two sets of windows. The west building of the Palace held state reception halls and the imperial family&#x27;s private chambers.

Five reception halls (Georgievsky, Vladimirsky, Aleksandrovsky, Andreyevsky, and Ekaterininsky) are named for orders of the Russian Empire: the Orders of St. George, St. Vladimir, St. Alexander, St. Andrew, and St. Catherine. The Georgievsky Hall is used today for state and diplomatic receptions and official ceremonies. International treaties are signed in the Vladimirsky Hall, which also leads to the Palace of Facets, the Tsarina&#x27;s Golden Chamber, the Terem Palace, the Winter Palace, and the Palace of Congresses. Aleksandrovsky Hall and Andreyevsky Hall were combined in Soviet times to be used for meetings and conferences of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR; but they were lavishly restored in accordance with Thon&#x27;s designs in the 1990s. 

== Structure and architecture ==
The Grand Kremlin Palace is 125 metres long and 47 metres high. The total area of the complex exceeds 25,000 square metres. In plan, the Grand Kremlin Palace is presented in the form of a square with a small Cour d&#x27;honneur, in the centre of which was the Church of the Saviour on Boru, demolished in the 1930s. The main façade of the complex faces the Kremlin embankment, with the palace&#x27;s Annunciation Entrance overlooking Sobornaya Square.

Architect Konstantin Thon repeated the composition of the previous palace complex, consisting of various buildings of different times. Art historians suppose that following the peculiarities of Old Russian architecture the complex was asymmetrical. Presumably, the arcade of the ground floor was an allegory for the composition of the palace of Ivan III, and the winter garden corresponded to the ancient Kremlin parks. The façades of the complex corresponding to the decoration of the Terem Palace, in particular, the architect repeated the framing of the windows in greatly enlarged dimensions. They are in the form of arches with narrow piers, giving the building a resemblance to an enclosed gallery. The second tier is divided by pilasters and richly decorated with carved white-stone platbands in Russian-Byzantine style with double arches in the centre, typical for Russian architecture of the 17th century. Before 1917, the facade of the palace was decorated with five white-stone bas-reliefs in the form of two-headed eagles, above which were the emblems of Moscow, St Petersburg, Kazan, Astrakhan, Poland and Tavrida. After the October Revolution, they were replaced with the letters СССР and the coat of arms of the Soviet Union.

=== Layout ===
The palace has a geometric plan characteristic of late classicism. However, the main entrance is not in the centre of the main facade, but in the eastern part of the palace, which was unusual for the architecture of that period. The entranceway is modestly decorated and is highlighted on the outside by a pair of lights hanging on chains. The shape of the doors corresponds to the window openings. The location of the entrance was necessitated by the need to accommodate a straight grand staircase of 66 steps, the length of which would not have allowed the structure to be installed in the centre of the complex. It is made of Revel stone. The walls of the room are made of artificial marble and the columns are made of natural Serdobol marble. A staircase leads to the first floor to the vestibule, from where the enfilade of grand double-height halls and ceremonial chambers begins. Next to the main entrance on the ground floor is a marble vestibule with polished granite columns, as well as the Own Half of the Imperial Family.

== Current status ==
The Grand Kremlin Palace is the current residence of the Russian president, where official events are held. For example, the inauguration of the President of Russia takes place in The Hall of the Order of St. Andrew. Excursions take place during free time from official events according to requests from organisations addressed to the Head of the Commandant&#x27;s Office of the Moscow Kremlin. Visitors may see the Faceted Chamber, the premises of the Teremnoy Palace, the Private Half of Their Imperial Majesties, and the ceremonial halls of the orders, except for the Catherine Palace. The tour itinerary also does not include the Emperor&#x27;s study and the Golden Chamber of Tsaritsyno.

== Interiors of the ceremonial halls ==
=== The Hall of the Order of St. George ===

The Hall of the Order of St. George (Georgievsky Hall) is the first and largest of the staterooms of the palace. It was named after the Order of St. George the Victorious, which was approved by Catherine II in 1769 and which was the highest military decoration of the Russian Empire. The walls of the room are decorated with gold embossed stars and insignia with the motto &quot;For Service and Bravery&quot; (&quot;Za Sluzhbu i Khrabrost&quot;). The room is covered by a semi-cylindrical coffered ceiling supported by eighteen pylons. At the top, they are decorated with statues symbolising the country&#x27;s military victories. By order of the emperor, marble plaques with a list of the regiments, crews and batteries which had received the St George Colors were installed in the room. In addition, the names of all the holders of the order were engraved on the walls.

Initially, civil servants and representatives of the Moscow nobility gathered in St George&#x27;s Hall during the celebrations. During a reception on the occasion of the 1945 Victory Parade, invited servicemen gathered in St George&#x27;s Hall. The room was subsequently used for the presentation of military awards, decorations and prizes to figures of science and culture, as well as meetings of party representatives with civilians.

=== The Hall of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky ===

The Hall of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky was named after the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, established by Catherine I in 1725. The room is situated in the central part of the first floor on the south façade of the complex and is connected with The Hall of the Order of St. George by massive silver-plated doors with gold ornaments, depicting the Order&#x27;s ribbons and stars.

The rectangular room is 31 metres long, 20 metres wide and 20 metres high. The hall is decorated with the coats of arms of the provinces and districts of the Russian Empire, wall mirrors, four marble fireplaces and candelabrums made in the factories of the Duke of Leuchtenberg. From above, it is covered by an elliptical dome on four pylons with images of the Order&#x27;s coats of arms, stars and the monogram of St. Alexander. The parquet is of thirty species of wood.

Initially in The Hall of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky six paintings of the artist Feodor Moller, representing the moments from Alexander Nevskiy&#x27;s life, were placed: his entrance to the liberated Pskov, The Battle of the Neva, his marriage with the Polotsk princess, his stay in Golden Horde.

In the 1930s the room was reconstructed and became part of the Assembly Hall. The interiors were restored in 1994-1999 and the room was subsequently used for meetings of the State Council.

=== The Hall of the Order of St. Vladimir ===

The Hall of the Order of St. Vladimir was named after the Order of St. Vladimir, instituted by Catherine the Great in 1782. Light enters the hall only through a lantern in the centre of the hipped dome from which hangs a tiered chandelier made in a factory in St Petersburg. The three-toned structure was originally placed in The Anteroom, for which it proved too large, and it was later re-hung in The Hall of the Order of St. Vladimir. The room also had four-floor lamps of dark bronze.

The spatial composition of the room reminds of a baptistery and is designed as a rotunda with a by-pass gallery and a balustrade on the first-floor level. The room was originally a square in plan with sides of sixteen metres each, but the niches in the corners give it a resemblance to an octagon. The decoration of the room corresponded to the symbols of the Order and was done in a range of white, pink and pale green colours. The walls and pilasters are lined with pink and white marble, and the star-shaped parquet is made of more than twenty kinds of wood. The dome of the hall is decorated with mouldings depicting the Order of St. Vladimir.

After 1918, the Hall of the Order of St. Vladimir was used for signing treaties between the USSR and foreign countries.

=== The Hall of the Order of St. Andrew ===
The Hall of the Order of St. Andrew was the main room in the enfilade of official rooms dedicated to the military honours of the Russian Empire. It corresponded to the Order of St. Andrew, which Peter the Great established in 1698.

The hall was used for ceremonial events and the coronations of Alexander II, Alexander III and Nicholas II were held within its walls. Initially, the centrepiece of the room was the throne of the incumbent monarch, decorated with carvings and precious stones. At the end of the 19th century, the pedestal was replaced by three seats for Emperor Nicholas II, Empresses Alexandra Feodorovna and Maria Feodorovna.

After the Russian Revolution, the Comintern congresses, conventions and summit meetings were held in the Hall of the Order of St. Andrew. In 1933-1934, the Hall of the Order of St. Andrew and the Hall of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky were merged and rebuilt to hold meetings of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

In 1993, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the restoration of the historic appearance of the chambers.

After the reconstruction, the room was used for solemn meetings and events. Now the hall is used for sessions of the State Council and meetings of foreign ambassadors. The inauguration of the Russian president takes place in the Hall of the Order of St. Andrew.

=== The Hall of the Order of St. Catherine ===
The Hall of the Order of St. Catherine served as the throne room for Russian empresses and was named after the Order of St. Catherine, established in 1714. Flanking the entrance are pilasters on massive pillars decorated with malachite mosaic patterns. The walls are decorated with orderly reliefs, made in filigree and decorated with rhinestones. The parquet was designed by Fedor Solntsev.

In the 20th century, the halls of the Grand Kremlin Palace were used for meetings of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities, as well as various committees during sessions of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. During World War II, solemn meetings with foreign delegations were organised in the Grand Kremlin Palace. Seventeen events were held within the walls of The Hall of the Order of St. Catherine during this period. Chinese diplomat Soong Ziwen and General Dwight Eisenhower, among others, were present at these receptions.

As of 2018, the hall was not included in the tour programme of the Grand Kremlin Palace, as the room was used for meetings of the Russian president with foreign delegations and negotiations.

<text>A salary is a form of periodic payment from an employer to an employee, which may be specified in an employment contract. It is contrasted with piece wages, where each job, hour or other unit is paid separately, rather than on a periodic basis.
Salary can also be considered as the cost of hiring and keeping human resources for corporate operations, and is hence referred to as personnel expense or salary expense. In accounting, salaries are recorded in payroll accounts.

A salary is a fixed amount of money or compensation paid to an employee by an employer in return for work performed. Salary is commonly paid in fixed intervals, for example, monthly payments of one-twelfth of the annual salary.

Salaries are typically determined by comparing market pay-rates for people performing similar work in similar industries in the same region. Salary is also determined by leveling the pay rates and salary ranges established by an individual employer. Salary is also affected by the number of people available to perform the specific job in the employer&#x27;s employment locale (supply and demand).

==History==

===First paid salary===

While there is no first pay-stub for the first work-for-pay exchange, the first salaried work would have required a society advanced enough to have a barter system which allowed for the even exchange of goods or services between tradesmen. More significantly, it presupposes the existence of organized employers—perhaps a government or a religious body—that would facilitate work-for-hire exchanges on a regular enough basis to constitute salaried work. From this, most infer that the first salary would have been paid in a village or city during the Neolithic Revolution, sometime between 10,000 BCE and 6000 BCE.

A cuneiform inscribed clay tablet dated about 3100 BCE provides a record of the daily beer rations for workers in Mesopotamia. The beer is represented by an upright jar with a pointed base. The symbol for rations is a human head eating from a bowl. Round and semicircular impressions represent the measurements.

By the time of the Hebrew Book of Ezra (550 to 450 BCE), receiving salt from a person was synonymous with drawing sustenance, taking pay, or being in that person&#x27;s service. At that time, salt production was strictly controlled by the monarchy or ruling elite. Depending on the translation of Ezra 4:14, the servants of King Artaxerxes I of Persia explain their loyalty variously as &quot;because we are salted with the salt of the palace&quot; or &quot;because we have maintenance from the king&quot; or &quot;because we are responsible to the king&quot;.

===&quot;Salarium&quot;===
The Latin word &quot;salarium&quot; linked employment, salt, and soldiers, but the exact link is not clear. Modern sources maintain that although Roman soldiers were typically paid in coin, the word &quot;salarium&quot; is derived from the word &quot;sal&quot; (salt) because at some point a soldier&#x27;s salary may have been an allowance for the purchase of salt or the price of having soldiers conquer salt supplies and guard the Salt Roads (&quot;Via Salaria&quot;) that led to Rome. However, there is no ancient evidence for either of these hypotheses.

===Roman empire and medieval and pre-industrial Europe===
Regardless of the exact connection, the &quot;salarium&quot; paid to Roman soldiers has defined a form of work-for-hire ever since in the Western world, and gave rise to such expressions as &quot;being worth one&#x27;s salt&quot;.

Within the Roman Empire or (later) medieval and pre-industrial Europe and its mercantile colonies, salaried employment appears to have been relatively rare and mostly limited to servants and higher status roles, especially in government service. Such roles were largely remunerated by the provision of lodging, food, and livery clothes (i.e., &quot;food, clothing, and shelter&quot; in modern idiom). Many courtiers, such as valets de chambre, in late medieval courts were paid annual amounts, sometimes supplemented by large if unpredictable extra payments. At the other end of the social scale, those in many forms of employment either received no pay, as with slavery (although many slaves were paid some money at least), serfdom, and indentured servitude, or received only a fraction of what was produced, as with sharecropping. Other common alternative models of work included self- or co-operative employment, as with masters in artisan guilds, who often had salaried assistants, or corporate work and ownership, as with medieval universities and monasteries.

===Commercial Revolution===
Even many of the jobs initially created by the Commercial Revolution in the years from 1520 to 1650 and later during Industrialisation in the 18th and 19th centuries would not have been salaried, but, to the extent they were paid as employees, probably paid an hourly or daily wage or paid per unit produced (also called piece work).

===Share in earnings===
In corporations of this time, such as the several East India Companies, many managers would have been remunerated as owner-shareholders. Such a remuneration scheme is still common today in accounting, investment, and law firm partnerships where the leading professionals are equity partners, and do not technically receive a salary, but rather make a periodic &quot;draw&quot; against their share of annual earnings.

===Second Industrial Revolution===
From 1870 to 1930, the Second Industrial Revolution gave rise to the modern business corporation powered by railroads, electricity and the telegraph and telephone. This era saw the widespread emergence of a class of salaried executives and administrators who served the new, large-scale enterprises being created.

New managerial jobs lent themselves to salaried employment, in part because the effort and output of &quot;office work&quot; were hard to measure hourly or piecewise, and in part because they did not necessarily draw remuneration from share ownership.

As Japan rapidly industrialized in the 20th century, the idea of office work was novel enough that a new Japanese word (salaryman) was coined to describe those who performed it, as well as referencing their remuneration.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, the rise of the service economy made salaried employment even more common in developed countries, where the relative share of industrial production jobs declined, and the share of executive, administrative, computer, marketing, and creative jobs—all of which tended to be salaried—increased.

===Salary and other forms of payment today===
Today, the concept of a salary continues to evolve as part of a system of the total compensation that employers offer to employees. Salary (also now known as fixed pay) is coming to be seen as part of a &quot;total rewards&quot; system which includes bonuses, incentive pay, commissions, benefits and perquisites (or perks), and various other tools which help employers link rewards to an employee&#x27;s measured performance.

Compensation has evolved considerably. Consider the change from the days of and before the industrial evolution, when a job was held for a lifetime, to the fact that, from 1978 to 2008, individuals who aged from 18 to 44, held an average number of 11 jobs. Compensation has evolved gradually moving away from fixed short-term immediate compensation towards fixed + variable outcomes-based compensation. An increase in knowledge-based work has also led to pursuit of partner (as opposed to employee) like engagement.

Salary surveys provide data on salaries for specific jobs throughout the market. Organizations may use salary survey data to develop and update their compensation packages. Individuals may use salary survey data in salary negotiations.

==By country==

===Botswana===
In Botswana, salaries are almost entirely paid on a monthly basis with pay dates falling on different dates of the second half of the month. Pay day usually ranges from the 15th of the month to the last day. The date of disbursement of the salary is usually determined by the company and in some cases in conjunction with the recognized Workers Union.

The Botswana Employment Act Cap 47:01 Chapter VII regulates the aspect of protection of wages in the contracts of employment. The minimum and maximum wage payment period with the exception of casual employees should not be less than one week or more than a month, and where not expressly stipulated a month is the default wage period per section 75 of the Act payable before the third working day after the wage period. The wages are to be paid during working hours at the place of employment, or in any other way, such as through a bank account with the consent of the employee. Salaries should be made in legal tender, however, part payment in kind is not prohibited provided it is appropriate for the personal use and benefit of employee and his family, and the value attributable to such payment in kind is fair and reasonable. The payment in kind should not exceed forty per cent of the total amount paid out to the employee.

The minimum wage is set, adjusted and can even be abolished by the Minister on the advice of the Minimum Wages Advisory Board for specified trade categories. The stipulated categories include building, construction, hotel, catering, wholesale, watchmen, the domestic service sector, the agricultural sector etc. The current minimum wages set for these sectors are set out in the Subsidiary legislation in the Act.

Women on maternity leave are entitled to 25% of their salaries as stipulated by the Employment Act but the majority of the companies pay out at about 50% for the period.

===Denmark===
Trilateral negotiations (Danish: &quot;trepartsforhandlinger&quot;) between employers&#x27;, employees&#x27; &amp; state organizations determine a collective remuneration agreement for most Danish privately employed blue-collar employees for a period of typically 3 or 4 years. Such an agreement is known as an &quot;overenskomst&quot; or just OK and covers an agreement between a specific employee union (&quot;fagforening&quot;/&quot;fagforbund&quot;) and a specific employer organization (&quot;arbejdsgiverforening&quot;/&quot;arbejdsgiverorganisation&quot;).

Political agreements made in 1997, known as &quot;Ny Løn&quot; (English: &quot;new remuneration&quot;), instigated a formal remuneration system that almost all employees in the Danish Government are employed under. An individual&#x27;s remuneration consist of five components;
* grundløn (lit. &quot;base salary&quot;): base salary derived from education level &amp; seniority
* kvalifikationsløn (lit. &quot;qualification salary&quot;): additional salary based on qualifications (additional formal or non-formal education, language or social skills etc.)
* funktionstillæg (functional supplement): additional salary paid for responsibilities of the specific role not covered by the above
* resultatillæg (achievement supplement): additional salary paid for specific predetermined achievements, typically used for long-term motivation of leadership 
* engangstillæg (one-time supplement): additional salary paid to honor an outstanding effort, typically paid yearly

There is no minimum salary determined by law. A salary is often discussed or given as a gross monthly salary (&quot;månedlig bruttoløn&quot;) which is pre-tax but including any pension benefits required by collective agreements (&quot;overenskomst&quot;) to be deposited by the employer. This typically amounts to 8-12% of the monthly net salary (&quot;månedlig nettoløn&quot;), of which the employee is also obligated to deposit a part, typically another 4-6%.

===European Union===
According to European law, the movement of capital, services and (human) resources is unlimited between member states. Salary determination, such as minimum wage, is still the prerogative of each member state. Other social benefits, associated with salaries are also determined on member-state level.

===India===
In India, salaries are generally paid on the last working day of the month (Government, Public sector departments, Multi-national organisations as well as majority of other private sector companies). According to the Payment of Wages Act, if a company has less than 1,000 Employees, salary is paid by the 7th of every month. If a company has more than 1,000 Employees, salary is paid by the 10th of every month.

Minimum wages in India are governed by the Minimum Wages Act, 1948. Employees in India are notified of their salary being increased through a hard copy letter given to them.

===Italy===
In Italy, the Constitution guarantees a minimum wage, as stated in Article 36, Paragraph 1

:&quot;Workers have the right to a remuneration commensurate to the quantity and quality of their work and in any case such as to ensure them and their families a free and dignified existence.&quot;

This constitutional guarantee is implemented not through a specific legislation, but rather through collective bargaining which sets minimum wage standards in a sector by sector basis. Collective bargaining is protected by trade unions, which have constitutional rights such as legal personality.
The Constitution also guarantees equal pay for women, as stated in Article 37, Paragraph 1

:&quot;Working women are entitled to equal rights and, for comparable jobs, equal pay as men.&quot;

A salary is often discussed or given in terms of &quot;Retribuzione Annuale Lorda&quot; (RAL), similar to gross annual salary. Also a severance pay, &quot;Trattamento di Fine Rapporto&quot; (TFR), is required to be deposited by the employer to be paid to the employee on termination.

===Japan===

In Japan, owners would notify employees of salary increases through &quot;jirei&quot;. The concept still exists and has been replaced with an electronic form, or E-mail in larger companies.
The position and world of &quot;salarymen&quot; is open to only one third of Japanese men. From school age these young potentials are groomed and pre-selected to one day join a company as a &quot;salaryman&quot;. The selection process is rigorous and thereafter the process initiation speaks of total dedication to the company.

===Poland===
Article 65 section 4 of Polish Constitution states that &quot;the minimum amount of salary for work or the method of determining this amount will be specified by separate act&quot;. In consequence, Polish Parliament (Sejm) has enacted an Act of 10 October 2002 on the minimum salary for work, which determines the rules and the procedure of establishing minimum salary for each year. The amount of the minimum salary (for employment contracts) and the amount of minimum hourly rate (for service contacts) is announced by the Council of Ministers by September 15 each year in the Official Journal of the Republic of Poland &quot;Monitor Polski&quot;. As a result, full-time employees cannot be offered monthly salary lower than the statutory minimum, part-time employees are also covered by the statutory minimum calculated proportionally.

===South Africa===
Minimum wages are used widely in developing countries to protect vulnerable workers, reduce wage inequality, and lift the working poor out of poverty. The political popularity of minimum wages stems in part from the fact that the policy offers a means for redistributing income without having to increase government spending or establish formal transfer mechanisms. The challenge to policymakers is to find that wage level that is considered fair given workers&#x27; needs and the cost of living, but does not harm employment or a country&#x27;s global competitiveness.

South African median employee earning is R2800 a month (USD ) and the average earning is around R8500. These figures are found in SA statistics. Indeed, they reflect the huge gap in the South African society with a large proportion of the population under poverty line that does not have the same opportunities for employment.

Median monthly earnings of white (R9500) and Indian/Asian (R6000) population were substantially higher
than the median monthly earnings of their coloured (R2652) and black African (R2167) counterparts. Black
Africans earned 22,% of what the white population earned; 36,1% of what Indians/Asians earned; and
81,7% of what the coloured population earned. In the bottom 5%, black Africans earned R500 or less per month while the white population earned R2 000 or less, while in the top 5% they earned R12 567 or more compared to the white population who earned R34000 or more per month.

===The Netherlands===
In the Netherlands the salary which occurs most frequently is referred to as Jan Modaal. The term &quot;modaal&quot; is derived from the statistical term Modus. If the government&#x27;s macro economic policy negatively affects this &quot;Modaal&quot; income or salary-group often the policy is adjusted in order to protect this group of income earners. The Dutch word &quot;soldij&quot; can be directly linked to the word &quot;soldaat&quot; or soldier, which finds its origin in the word for the gold coin solidus, with which soldiers were paid during the Roman Empire.

The Netherlands is in the top 5 of the highest salary-paying countries in the EU. The focus has been on the salary levels and accompanying bonuses whereas secondary benefits, though present, has been downplayed yet that is changing. The Netherlands claims a 36th position when it comes to secondary benefits when compared to other countries in Europe.

The minimum wage is determined through collective labor negotiations (CAOs). The minimum wage is age dependent; the legal minimum wage for a 16-year-old is lower than, for instance, a 23-year-old (full minimum wage). Adjustments to the minimum wage are made twice a year; on January 1 and on July 1. The minimum wage for a 21-year-old on January 1, 2013, is 1,065.30 Euro netto per month and on July 1, 2013, this minimum wage is 1,071.40 Euro netto per month.
For a 23 year old on 1 January 2014 is 1485,60 Euro gross salary / month plus 8% holiday subsidy so 1604,45 Euro gross salary / month

===United States===

In the United States, the distinction between periodic salaries (which are normally paid regardless of hours worked) and hourly wages (meeting a minimum wage test and providing for overtime) was first codified by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. At that time, five categories were identified as being &quot;exempt&quot; from minimum wage and overtime protections, and therefore salariable. In 1991, some computer workers were added as a sixth category but effective August 23, 2004 the categories were revised and reduced back down to five (executive, administrative, professional, computer, and outside sales employees).

In June 2015 the Department of Labor proposed raising &quot;the salary threshold from $455 a week (the equivalent of $23,660 a year) to about $970 a week ($50,440 a year) in 2016&quot; On May 18, 2016, the Final rule updating the overtime regulations was announced. Effective December 1, 2016 it says:

A general rule for comparing periodic salaries to hourly wages is based on a standard 40-hour work week with 50 weeks per year (minus two weeks for vacation). (Example: $40,000/year periodic salary divided by 50 weeks equals $800/week. Divide $800/week by 40 standard hours equals $20/hour).

===Zimbabwe===
Zimbabwe operates on a two tier system being wages and salaries. Wages are managed by the National Employment Council (NEC). Each sector has its own NEC; i.e. agriculture, communications, mining, catering, educational institutions, etc. On the council are representatives from the unions and the employers. The public sector is under the Public Service Commission and wages and salaries are negotiated there.

Wages are negotiated annually or biennially for minimum wages, basic working conditions and remunerations. If there is a stalemate it goes for arbitration with the Ministry of labour. The ruling will become binding on all companies in that industry. Industries often then use their associations to negotiate and air their views. For example, the mining industry nominates an employee within the chamber of mines to attend all meetings and subcommittee with industry players is a forum for discussions.

Salaries are negotiated by the respective employees. However, NEC obviously affects the relativity and almost acts as a barometer for salaried staff. Salaries and wages in Zimbabwe are normally paid monthly. Most companies&#x27; pay around the 20th does allow various statutory payments and processing for the month end. Government employees are also staggered to ease the cash flow though teachers are paid around mid-month being 16th. Agricultural workers are normally paid on the very last day of the month as they are contract employees.

Zimbabwe is a highly banked society with most salaries being banked. All government employees are paid through the bank. Since &quot;dollarisation&quot; (movement from the Zimbabwean dollar to USD) Zimbabwe has been moving toward a more informal sector and these are paid in &#x27;brown envelopes&#x27;.

PAYE (Pay As You Earn) is a significant contributor to tax being 45%. Given the high unemployment rate the tax is quite heavy. This of course captures those that pay and keep records properly. The average salary is probably $250. This is skewed downwards by the large number of government employees whose average salary is around there. At the top end salaries are quite competitive and this is to be able to attract the right skills though the cost of living is high so it balances this out. A top-earning Zimbabwean spends a lot more money on necessities than say a South African top earner. This is more evident when a comparison with USA or England is done. The need to have a generator, borehole or buy water or take care of the extended family since there is no welfare given the government&#x27;s financial position.

In the hyperinflation days salaries was the cheapest factor of production given that it was paid so irregularly though it went to twice monthly. As workers could not withdraw their money, remuneration was often in the following forms:
*Fuel coupons were most popular and individuals were paid in liters of fuel
*The product that the company is selling; e.g. pork/meat for the abattoirs
*Foreign currency payment was illegal and one had to seek special dispensation or had to show that their revenue/funding was received in foreign currency like NGOs or exporters
*Shares for the listed companies on the stock market (not in the traditional option scheme but just getting shares)

Prices were price controlled. By remunerating in the product it basically allowed the employees to side sell for real value.

Zimbabwe traditionally had a competitive advantage in its cost of labor. With &quot;dollarisation&quot; and higher cost of living this is slowly being eroded. For example, an average farm employee probably earned the equivalent of $20 but could buy a basket of goods currently worth $500. Now, the average farm worker earns $80 and that basket of goods is, as mentioned, $500, the basket being soap, meal, school fees, protein foods, etc.

==Negotiation of salary==

Prior to the acceptance of an employment offer, the prospective employee usually has the opportunity to negotiate the terms of the offer. This primarily focuses on salary, but extends to benefits, work arrangements, and other amenities as well. Negotiating salary can potentially lead the prospective employee to a higher salary. In fact, a 2009 study of employees indicated that those who negotiated salary saw an average increase of $4,913 from their original salary offer. In addition, the employer is able to feel more confident that they have hired an employee with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to deal with conflict. Negotiating salary will thus likely yield an overall positive outcome for both sides of the bargaining table.

Perhaps the most important aspect of salary negotiation is the level of preparation put in by the prospective employee. Background research on comparable salaries will help the prospective employee understand the appropriate range for that position. Assessment of alternative offers that the prospective employee has already received can help in the negotiation process. Research on the actual company itself will help identify where concessions can be made by the company and what may potentially be considered off-limits. These items, and more, can be organized into a
negotiations planning document that can be used in the evaluation of the offers received from the employer.

===Effects of perspective===
The same 2009 study highlighted the personality differences and negotiation mind-sets that contributed to successful outcomes. Overall, individuals who are risk-averse (e.g., worried about appearing ungrateful for the job offer) tended to avoid salary negotiations or use very weak approaches to the negotiation process. On the contrary, those who were more risk-tolerant engaged in negotiations more frequently and demonstrated superior outcomes. Individuals who approached the negotiation as a distributive problem (i.e. viewing the a higher salary as a win for him/her and a loss to the employer) ended up with an increased salary, but lower rate of satisfaction upon completion. Those who approached the negotiation as an integrative problem (i.e. viewing the negotiation process an opportunity to expand the realm of possibilities and help both parties achieve a “win” outcome) were able to both secure an increased salary and an outcome they were truly satisfied with.

===Gender differences===
Salary disparities between men and women may partially be explained by differences in negotiation tactics used by men and women. Although men and women are equally likely to initiate in a salary negotiation with employers, men will achieve higher outcomes than women by about 2% of starting salary Studies have indicated that men tend to use active negotiation tactics of directly asking for a higher salary, while women tend to use more of an indirect approach by emphasizing self-promotion tactics (e.g. explaining the motivation to be a good employee). Other research indicates that early-childhood play patterns may influence the way men and women negotiate. Men and women tend to view salary differently in terms of relative importance. Overall level of confidence in a negotiation may also be a determinant of why men tend to achieve higher outcomes in salary negotiations. Finally, the awareness of this stereotype alone may directly cause women to achieve lower outcomes as one study indicates. Regardless of the cause, the outcome yields a disparity between men and women that contributes to the overall wage gap observed in many nations.

The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 239 provides for the right to fair labour practices in terms of article 23. article 9 of the Constitution makes provision for equality in the Bill of Rights, which an employee may raise in the event of an equal pay dispute. In terms of article 9(1) “everyone is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law&#x27;” Furthermore, “the state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language, and birth.”
South African employees who were in paid employment had median monthly earnings of R2 800. The median monthly earnings for men (R3 033) were higher than that for women (R2 340) - women in paid employment earned 77,1% of what men did.

===Role of weight===
Research done in 2011 showed that the “weight double standard” may be more complex that what past research has suggested. This is not only relevant to women, but also to men. The smallest income gap differences occur at thin weights (where men are penalized and women are rewarded) and the opposite happens at heavier weights, where the women are affected more negatively.

<doc id="610453" wikidata="Q5350511" url="?curid=610453" title="Eknath Easwaran">
<text>Eknath Easwaran (December 17, 1910 October 26, 1999) was an Indian-born spiritual teacher, author and translator and interpreter of Indian religious texts such as the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and the Upanishads.
Easwaran was a professor of English literature at the University of Nagpur in India when he came to the United States in 1959 on the Fulbright Program at the University of Minnesota before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley. In 1961, Easwaran founded the Blue Mountain Center of Meditation, based in northern California. In 1968 Easwaran established Nilgiri Press. Nilgiri Press has published over thirty books that he authored.

Easwaran was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, whom he met when he was a young man. Easwaran developed a method of meditation silent repetition in the mind of memorized inspirational passages from the world&#x27;s major religious and spiritual traditions which later came to be known as Passage Meditation.

His teachings inspired some of his students to create the 1976 vegetarian cookbook &quot;Laurel&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;.

He has been accused of sexual abuse by former residents of Ramagiri Ashram.

==Biography==
Eknath Easwaran was born in 1910 in a village in Kerala, India. 
&quot;Eknath&quot; is his surname, &quot;Easwaran&quot; his given name. Brought up by his mother, and by his maternal grandmother whom he honored as his spiritual teacher, he was schooled in his native village until the age of sixteen, when he went to attend St. Thomas College, Thrissur, a Catholic college fifty miles away. He graduated at the University of Nagpur in English and law. He served as Chair of the Department of English at University of Nagpur. Prior to arriving in the United States, he had a family with two children.

In 1959, he came to the United States as a Fulbright scholar.

From 1960–1961 Easwaran gave talks on the Indian scriptures in the San Francisco Bay Area. He met his American wife Christine at one of these talks. Easwaran founded the Blue Mountain Center of Meditation in 1961. He went back to India in 1962 to fulfill the terms of the Fulbright, returning to the Bay Area in 1965 to continue his teaching. In 1968 he was invited by a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, to teach on a Religious Studies course entitled The Theory and Practice of Meditation – the first in the country offering credits.

In 1970 he founded &quot;Ramagiri Ashram&quot; as a community of dedicated followers in Marin County.

He set up a publishing activity, Nilgiri Press, which printed his first book &quot;Gandhi The Man&quot;, telling the story of Gandhi as a spiritual as well as a political leader. His first major work was his 3-volume commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, the &quot;Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living&quot;, the first volume of which was printed in 1975 and the last in 1984. His book &quot;Meditation&quot; on the program of meditation and allied disciplines that he developed first appeared in 1978.

By 2018, Easwaran&#x27;s methods of spiritual practice had been the focus of two major scientific research programs that had produced thirty refereed research reports.

==Published works==
Easwaran&#x27;s written works may be grouped into several major categories—primarily books, but also articles in newspapers and other periodicals. Most of his books have been reviewed by spiritually oriented publications or websites, or by nationally known media such as &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, or the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

In addition, a large number of Easwaran&#x27;s recorded talks have been published in video and audio formats.

===Translations===

Easwaran&#x27;s translations of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, and the &quot;Dhammapada&quot; (see article) have been critically acclaimed. Religion scholar Huston Smith is cited by the publisher as writing: &quot;No one in modern times is more qualified no, make that &#x27;as qualified&#x27; to translate the epochal Classics of Indian Spirituality than Eknath Easwaran. And the reason is clear. It is impossible to get to the heart of those classics unless you live them, and he did live them. My admiration of the man and his works is boundless.&quot;
In &quot;Buddhism: A Concise Introduction&quot; Smith and his coauthor Philip Novak wrote that &quot;Our favorite translation is Eknath Easwaran&#x27;s &quot;The Dhammapada&quot;. His Indian heritage, literary gifts, and spiritual sensibilities... here produce a sublime rendering of the words of the Buddha. Verse after verse shimmers with quiet, confident authority. A bonus is the sparkling 70-page introduction to the Buddha&#x27;s life and teachings.&quot;

Since 2009, Easwaran&#x27;s three translations &quot;have each been the best-selling translations of these scriptures in the USA.&quot; In the US in 2016, each of Easwaran&#x27;s translations outsold the second best-selling translation in its category &quot;by more than 3:1&quot;, and the second editions have together sold more than 470,000 copies.

===Commentaries===

&quot;Essence of the Upanishads&quot;, originally entitled &quot;Dialogue with death: The spiritual psychology of the Katha Upanishad&quot;, explains how the Katha Upanishad embraces the key ideas of Indian spirituality within the context of a powerful mythic quest the story of a young hero who ventures into the land of death in search of immortality. &quot;&quot;Essence of the Upanishads&quot; is a westerner&#x27;s guide to this vitally important Indian text and its modern relevance to the Indian mindset and spirituality.&quot;

In &quot;Essence of the Bhagavad Gita&quot;, Easwaran places the Gita&#x27;s teachings in a modern context and comments on the Gita&#x27;s view of the nature of reality, the illusion of separateness, the search for identity, the meaning of yoga, and how to heal the unconscious. The book views the key message of the Gita as how to resolve our conflicts and live in harmony with the deep unity of life, through the practice of meditation and spiritual disciplines.

In &quot;Essence of the Dhammapada&quot;, Easwaran comments on the Dhammapada, sayings attributed to the Buddha himself, presenting it as a guide that gives straightforward teachings about spiritual perseverance, progress, and enlightenment.

===Books on meditation===

His book &quot;Passage Meditation&quot; (original title &quot;Meditation&quot;) describes the Eight Point Program that Easwaran developed, while his book &quot;Conquest of Mind&quot; goes further into the practice of these disciplines in daily life. &quot;Timeless Wisdom&quot; is a companion book to &quot;Passage Meditation&quot; and contains passages for meditation drawn from across the world&#x27;s spiritual traditions. His book &quot;Mantram Handbook: a practical guide to choosing your mantram and calming your mind&quot; addresses The Mantram, the second point in the program.

His book &quot;Strength in the Storm&quot; is an introduction to The Mantram, containing many stories and practical examples to help the reader learn how to harness the inner resources for dealing with challenges in daily living. His book &quot;Take Your Time&quot; explores &quot;Slowing Down&quot; and &quot;One-Pointed Attention&quot; in daily lives. &quot;Renewal&quot; is a pocket book of short readings on themes such as loving relationships, raising children, living simply, and aging wisely; &quot;Patience&quot;, the second in the pocket book series, shows how to cultivate Patience &quot;the ornament of the brave&quot; at any age. Other (older) books describe various aspects of leading a spiritual life: &quot;Climbing the Blue Mountain&quot;, &quot;Compassionate Universe&quot;, and &quot;Undiscovered Country&quot;.

===Daily readers and reference===

&quot;God Makes the Rivers to Flow&quot; is an anthology of writings from the sacred literature of the world, selected by Easwaran as useful for meditation. A larger (and earlier) version of &quot;Timeless Wisdom&quot;, it contains dozens of passages from diverse traditions, and identifies passages for particular stages in life, such as caregiving, families with small children, death and dying, grief and loss, and for building positive qualities such as patience, courage, devotion to God, and putting others first. &quot;Words to Live By&quot; is a set of daily readings with Easwaran&#x27;s commentary on applying the reading to daily life.

===&quot;The Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living&quot;===
The &quot;Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living&quot; is a manual for living a spiritual life, comprising a verse-by-verse commentary on India&#x27;s timeless scripture the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. The work is in three volumes, published in 1975, 1979 and 1984 respectively, in hardcover and later also in paperback. When the first paperbacks were published the volumes were given new subtitles: the &quot;End of Sorrow&quot;; &quot;Like a Thousand Suns&quot;; and &quot;To Love is To Know Me&quot;.

In 2020 the three-volume set was reissued as a second edition, and as a single-volume ebook.

In Volume 1 (the first six chapters of the Gita) Easwaran explains how readers can begin to transform themselves, even as householders engaged in busy lives. In Volume 2 (the next six chapters) Easwaran addresses the seeming divide between scientific knowledge and spiritual wisdom, and explains how the concept of the unity of life can help people in all their relationships. In Volume 3 (the final six chapters) he makes the connection between the Self within and the Reality underlying all creation – and how to make a difference to heal the environment and establish peace in the world.

===Spiritual biographies===

&quot;Gandhi the Man&quot; traces how Mohandas Gandhi transformed himself into one of the world&#x27;s great spiritual leaders.

&quot;Nonviolent Soldier of Islam&quot; is the life story of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a Pathan (or Pushtun) of Afghanistan and a devout Muslim, who raised the first nonviolent army in history to gain Indian independence from British colonial rule. This book was favorably discussed in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The book also inspired filmmaker and writer T.C. McLuhan, daughter of Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan, to make the film &quot;The Frontier Gandhi: Badshah Khan, a Torch for Peace&quot;, which won the 2009 Black Pearl Award for Best Documentary Film.

===Commentaries on Christian literature===

&quot;Original Goodness&quot; is a commentary on the Beatitudes. &quot;Love Never Faileth&quot; is a commentary on the writings of St Francis, St Paul, St Augustine, and Mother Teresa. &quot;Seeing with the Eyes of Love&quot; is a commentary on &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;.

===Newspapers and other periodicals===
In the 1980s and 1990s, Easwaran published a variety of commentaries on public events in prominent periodicals, especially 
&quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;,
and also in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 
elsewhere in the US,
and internationally.
He also wrote numerous commentaries that appeared in the &quot;Little Lamp&quot; (1961–1995), and in &quot;Blue Mountain&quot; (1990–present), quarterly journals published by the meditation center that he founded. In the 1960s, Easwaran published articles in other spiritual journals, such as the &quot;Mountain Path&quot;, published by Sri Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s ashram.
Before coming to the US in 1959, Easwaran contributed short stories and other writings to literary anthologies, and to magazines such as &quot;The Illustrated Weekly of India&quot;.

===Video and audio===
Many of Easwaran&#x27;s recorded talks have been published in video and audio formats.

Several dozen of Easwaran&#x27;s talks have been published as video DVDs, and now as downloadable MP4s as a free subscription from the Blue Mountain Center. 
Before publication as DVDs, videos of Easwaran&#x27;s talks were first released in VHS videotape format.
Some talks are published in downloadable audio/MP3 formats.
Instructions for meditation by Easwaran have been published in audio form as CDs. Some of Easwaran&#x27;s talks were earlier published as cassette tapes or LP records. 
Magazines have reviewed some of Easwaran&#x27;s published talks, both audio
and video,
since the 1990s.

Several of Easwaran&#x27;s written works, including &quot;Essence of the Upanishads&quot;, &quot;Passage Meditation&quot;, &quot;The Bhagavad Gita&quot;, &quot;The Dhammapada&quot; and &quot;Gandhi the Man&quot;, have been published as audio books, as voice-recorded by the British actor Paul Bazely, and also the philosopher Jacob Needleman.

==Eight-point program==

Easwaran&#x27;s program for spiritual growth consists of eight points, and is described comprehensively in his book &quot;Passage Meditation A Complete Spiritual Practice&quot; (originally published in 1978 as &quot;Meditation&quot;). Each point has a dedicated chapter:
# &quot;Meditation on a Passage&quot;: Silent repetition upon memorized inspirational passages from one of the world&#x27;s great religions. Practiced for one-half hour each morning.
# &quot;The Mantram&quot;: silent repetition of a &quot;mantram&quot;, holy name or hallowed phrase from one of the world&#x27;s great religions.
# &quot;Slowing Down&quot;: set priorities to reduce stress and hurry.
# &quot;One-Pointed Attention&quot;: give full concentration to whatever matter is currently at hand.
# &quot;Training the Senses&quot;: enjoy simple pleasures in order to avoid craving for unhealthy excess.
# &quot;Putting Others First&quot;: denounce selfishness and cultivating altruism.
# &quot;Spiritual Companionship&quot;: practice meditation in the company of others.
# &quot;Reading the Mystics&quot;: draw inspiration from the writings of the scriptures of all religions.

==Vegetarianism==
Easwaran was a lifelong vegetarian.

Students of Easwaran, inspired in part by his teachings about compassion and stewardship for the environment, published the highly influential vegetarian cookbook, &quot;Laurel&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; (1976), which had a strong impact on the natural foods movement within the American counterculture. A second edition, &quot;The New Laurel&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, was published in 1986.

The book has sold over a million copies. &quot;Laurel&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; contained extensive nutritional information from a scientific point of view.

==Sexual abuse allegations==
A newspaper article published in 1989 about a split at Easwaran&#x27;s meditation center stated that in 1983 two female disciples had accused Easwaran of making sexual advances and trying to fondle them over several years. In that article, some of his followers also described a cult-like environment at the center.

==Other influence==
A variety of influences of Easwaran&#x27;s life and work have been documented.

Easwaran&#x27;s teachings or practices have sometimes been taught as part of traditional college courses,
or as tools for self-management by health professionals.

Outside of the US, Easwaran&#x27;s life and teachings were profiled, along with those of a variety of other spiritual teachers, in a book published in India entitled &quot;Meditation Masters and their Insights&quot;.

Easwaran&#x27;s words have been included in collections of wisdom teachings, such as ones recently published by Chang (2006) and Parachin (2011).
Quotations from Easwaran&#x27;s translations have been used many times by both scholarly and popular writers.
Easwaran&#x27;s other writings have also been quoted by various types of authors, including writers of novels and short stories,
popular spirituality,
and articles on management theory.
Psychiatrist Aaron Beck and his colleagues quoted from Easwaran&#x27;s commentary on the Katha Upanishad.
The &quot;NAPRA ReView&quot; wrote that &quot;The volume of [Easwaran&#x27;s] work and the quality of his discourse suggest a man who has had a profound impact on the spiritual lives of many.&quot;

Easwaran&#x27;s method of passage meditation was followed by the poet Robert Lax. Near the end of his life, Lax&#x27;s only reading each day was from Easwaran&#x27;s book &quot;Words to Live By&quot;.

<doc id="610460" wikidata="Q2500370" url="?curid=610460" title="Urbis">
<text>Urbis is a building in Manchester, England, designed by Ian Simpson, which opened in 2002 as part of the redevelopment of Exchange Square. Originally a Museum of the City, a switch was made in 2005-06 to presenting exhibitions on popular culture alongside talks, gigs and special events. Urbis closed in 2010, reopening in 2012 as the National Football Museum.

==Architecture and design==
Urbis is a building in Cathedral Gardens, designed by Simpson Haugh and Partners with consulting engineers Martin Stockley Associates. The building has six storeys and a distinctive sloping form. Visitors were intended to travel to the top floor, accessed by a lift, to admire the cityscape, then progress down a series of cascading mezzanine floors past exhibits about cities. The fully glazed facades consist of approximately 2,200 glass panes arranged in horizontal strips. The building has an adiabatic cooling system for use in summer and heat recovery system for use in winter increasing its energy efficiency.

==History==
Urbis, a museum and exhibition centre intended to showcase inner-city life, opened on 27 June 2002 as a symbol of regeneration after the IRA&#x27;s 1996 Manchester bombing. The project attracted £30 million funding from the Millennium Commission and £1 million from Manchester City Council towards the running costs. The exhibition space covered five floors and hosted temporary exhibitions running for between three and five months.

The museum&#x27;s first director, Elizabeth Usher, resigned in March 2003 amid criticism that Urbis was not appealing and the exhibits were too abstract. First-year visitor figures fell 58,000 short of its 200,000 target and the Millennium Commission, who provided £20m of funds, threatened to reclaim its money if Manchester City Council had to close it.

Visitors paying a £5 admission fee were unimpressed and few visitors returned, which the management saw as a key problem. By October 2003, visitor numbers were below 200 a day and there was criticism over a £2m annual subsidy from Manchester City Council, &quot;The Guardian&quot; architecture critic Deyan Sudjic remarked that the exhibits were a &quot;spectacular missed opportunity&quot;, although Urbis did garner some praise in other quarters.

In an attempt to boost visitor figures, the admission fee was scrapped in December 2003. The plan worked: visitor figures trebled by January 2004 steadily increasing to fivefold by April 2004.

Urbis&#x27; chief executive admitted in 2010 that the &#x27;Museum of the City&#x27;, which ran from 2002 to 2004, &quot;just didn&#x27;t work&quot;. In 2004, a radical decision was taken to rebrand Urbis as an exhibition centre for British popular culture with emphasis on Manchester and no longer called a museum in an attempt to give it a clear identity. With no admission fee, Urbis shook off its white elephant title as visitor numbers rose and over a quarter of visitors came from outside the city.

===National Football Museum===

Urbis closed in February 2010 for conversion to the National Football Museum. Plans to relocate the National Football Museum from Preston in Lancashire had emerged in 2009. The museum trustees cited long-term funding worries as the reason for relocating to Manchester where 400,000 visitors a year – four times the previous figure – are expected.

Preston City Council, unhappy at the proposals, attempted to thwart the move. The University of Central Lancashire, Lancashire County Council and Preston City Council offered the museum £400,000 per year but were outbid by Manchester City Council&#x27;s £2 million. Admission is free and a broad advertising campaign will aim to attract visitors to Urbis. In the first 9 months of opening, the museum had already attracted 350,000 visitors.

<text>Howard Robert Horvitz ForMemRS NAS AAA&amp;S APS NAM (born May 8, 1947) is an American biologist whose research on the nematode worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Sydney Brenner and John E. Sulston, whose &quot;seminal discoveries concerning the genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death&quot; were &quot;important for medical research and have shed new light on the pathogenesis of many diseases&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Horvitz was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Jewish parents, the son of Mary R. (Savit), a school teacher, and Oscar Freedom Horvitz, a GAO accountant. He majored in mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he joined Alpha Epsilon Pi and spent his summers working for IBM, at first wiring panels for accounting machines and then in his final summer helping to develop IBM&#x27;s Conversational Programming System.

During his senior year, Horvitz took his first courses in biology and was encouraged by his professors to continue to study biology in graduate school, despite his limited coursework in the field. After he completed his undergraduate studies in 1968, he enrolled in graduate studies in biology at Harvard University, where he studied T4-induced modifications of &quot;E. coli&quot; RNA polymerase under the direction of Walter Gilbert and James Watson. He completed his PhD in 1974.

==Career==
In 1974, Horvitz took a postdoctoral position at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, England, where he worked with his future Nobel prize co-winners Sydney Brenner and John Sulston on the genetics and cell lineage of &quot;C. elegans&quot;. In 1978, Horvitz was offered a faculty position at MIT, where he is currently Professor of Biology and a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. He is also an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

Horvitz serves as the chair of the board of trustees for Society for Science &amp; the Public and is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s advisory board.

== Research ==
At LMB, Horvitz worked with Sulston to track every non-gonadal cell division that occurred during larval development, and published a complete description of these lineages in 1977. Later, in cooperation with Sulston and Martin Chalfie, Horvitz began investigations first characterizing several cell lineage mutants and then seeking genes that controlled cell lineage or that controlled specific lineages. In 1981, they identified and characterized the gene &quot;lin-4&quot;, a &quot;heterochronic&quot; mutant that changes the timeline of cell fates.

In his early work at MIT, Horvitz continued his work on cell lineage and cell fate, using &quot;C. elegans&quot; to investigate whether there was a genetic program controlling cell death, or apoptosis. In 1986, he identified the first &quot;death genes&quot;, &quot;ced-3&quot; and &quot;ced-4&quot;. He showed that functional &quot;ced-3&quot; and &quot;ced-4&quot; genes were a prerequisite for cell death to be executed. He went on to show that another gene, &quot;ced-9&quot;, protects against cell death by interacting with &quot;ced-4&quot; and &quot;ced-3&quot;, as well as identifying a number of genes that direct how a dead cell is eliminated. Horvitz showed that the human genome contains a &quot;ced-3&quot;-like gene.

Horvitz&#x27;s later research continued to use &quot;C. elegans&quot; to analyze the genetic control of animal development and behavior, as well as to link discoveries in the nematode to human diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He made further advancements in defining the molecular pathway of programmed cell death, and has identified several key components, including: EGL-1, a protein which activates apoptosis by inhibiting CED-9; transcription factors &quot;ces-1&quot; and &quot;ces-2,&quot; and &quot;ced-8,&quot; which controls the timing of cell death. He continued working on heterochronic mutants and other aspects of cell lineage, and established lines of research in signal transduction, morphogenesis, and neural development. Horvitz has collaborated with Victor Ambros and David Bartel on a project to characterize the complete set of the more than 100 microRNAs in the &quot;C. elegans&quot; genome.

==Works==

Horvitz has over 255 publications, has been cited over 49,000 times and has an h-index of 108.

<text>Paul Wild (; 5 October 1925 – 2 July 2014) was a Swiss astronomer and director of the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern, who discovered numerous comets, asteroids and supernovae.

== Biography ==

Wild was born on 5 October 1925 in the village of Wädenswil near Zürich, Switzerland. From 1944 through 1950, he studied mathematics and physics at the ETH Zurich. Thereafter, he worked at the California Institute of Technology where he researched galaxies and supernovas under the leadership of countryman Fritz Zwicky from 1951 through 1955.

At the Zimmerwald Observatory, near Bern, Wild made his first cometary discovery C/1957 U1 (1957 IX) on 2 October 1957. The parabolic comet was later named &quot;Latyshev-Wild–Burnham&quot;.

Professor Wild became director of the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern in 1980, and remained in this position until 1991. He died on 2 July 2014 at the age of 88 in Bern.
== Discoveries ==

During countless nights Wild observed the skies at the Zimmerwald Observatory near Bern and discovered numerous asteroids, comets and supernovae including:
* 4 periodic comets: 63P/Wild, 81P/Wild, 86P/Wild and 116P/Wild
* 3 parabolic comets: C/1957 U1, C/1967 C2 and C/1968 U1
* The Apollo asteroid 1866 Sisyphus and the two Amor asteroids 2368 Beltrovata and 3552 Don Quixote
* 41 supernovae, as well as 8 co-discoveries. His first discovered supernova was SN 1954A in NGC 4214, while his most recent was SN 1994M in NGC 4493.

The best known discovery of a comet occurred on 6 January 1978. This Jupiter-family comet was designated 1978 XI, P/Wild 2 or 81P/Wild. Wild 2 was chosen by NASA for its Stardust mission launched in 1999. The stardust spacecraft flew through the comet&#x27;s trail and collected samples of the tail&#x27;s dust. After the return of the spacecraft to earth, analysis of the dust particles by different researcher provided new insights about the evolution of the solar system. Organic compounds such as glycine, a fundamental chemical building block of life, were found on a comet for the first time. In addition, evidence of the presence of liquid water was detected.

He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 94 numbered minor planets during 1961–1994, one of which was a co-discovery with Czech-born Swiss astronomer Ivo Baueršíma.

<doc id="610469" wikidata="Q1671076" url="?curid=610469" title="Medieval archaeology">
<text>Medieval archaeology is the study of humankind through its material culture, specialising in the period of the European Middle Ages. At its broadest, the period stretches from the 5th to the 16th century and refers to post-Roman but pre-modern remains. The period covers the upheaval caused by the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and cultures such as the Vikings, the Saxons, and the Franks. Archaeologists often specialise in studying either the Early Middle Ages (Migration Period) or the High Middle Ages and Late Middle Ages, although many projects and professionals move across these chronological boundaries. The rich nature of the medieval written record means that archaeology has often been seen as the &quot;handmaiden to history&quot;, especially in the Late Middle Ages. Analysis of material culture may enrich or call into question written evidence from the medieval period and the two sources of evidence need to be used together. Medieval archaeology has examined the development of medieval settlements, particularly the development of medieval towns, monasteries, and castles. It has also contributed to understanding of the spread and development of Christian monasticism during the medieval period.

==History of the study of medieval archaeology==
The Society for Medieval Archaeology (United Kingdom) was founded in 1957. To celebrate its 50th anniversary, several publications examined the history of the society and the sub-discipline. Christopher Gerrard&#x27;s 2003 book &quot;Medieval Archaeology&quot; also charts the move in the United Kingdom from antiquarianism, through Victorian medievalism, on to the emergence of medieval archaeology as a sub-discipline in the 20th century. Michel de Boüard, the University of Caen, Ecole pratique des Hautes Etudes, and the Polish Academy of Sciences were instrumental in establishing medieval archaeology as a field in France in the second half of the 20th century.

==Areas of expertise==
The study of medieval archaeology often focuses on specific kinds of settlement pattern.

===Rural settlements and landscapes===
Pattern of medieval rural settlements are often quite different from modern time villages. This is true in terms of architecture, outline of the settlements and social structure.

===Towns===
There is a broad spectrum of pre-urban and urban settlements in the Middle Ages (e.g. early medieval trading places at the Northern Sea and the Baltic Sea, former Roman cities and town foundations of the late Middle Ages).

An important field of research is urban archaeology in still existing towns, which is determined by rescue archaeology.

===Castles===
Castles are medieval fortified structures.

===Church and monastic archaeology===
In the United Kingdom, the Dissolution of the Monasteries left many monastic sites abandoned. Where monasteries have survived or been converted for other uses, &quot;buildings archaeology&quot; has also been applied to study their history. Medieval monasteries often held large estates and the study of monastic landscapes is an area of specialised research. There have been two main waves of research in medieval monastic and church archaeology: 1970-1995 and 1995-present. The first wave was influenced by landscape history and processual archaeology; scholarship focused principally on historical, economic and technological questions and targeted individual sites and monuments for study. The second wave has been informed by post-processual approaches and considers change and complexity in religious landscapes and perspectives on religious space, embodiment and agency.

<text>Georges-Jean Arnaud (July 3, 1928 – April 26, 2020) was a French author.

==Biography==
Arnaud was born in Saint-Gilles-du-Gard, Camargue, Gard. He was first published in 1971 in the science fiction magazine &quot;Anticipation&quot; from the French publisher Fleuve Noir with his story &quot;Les Croisés de Mara&quot; [The Crusaders Of Mara]. This is the first volume of a trilogy entitled &quot;Chroniques de la Longue Séparation&quot; [Chronicles of the Long Separation], in which a group of characters from the lost human colony of Mara, which had reverted to feudalism, rediscovered their origins and then embarked on a quest through space to find Earth.

Arnaud is the author of more than three hundred novels of different genres, including espionage thrillers, detective fiction, science fiction, horror, erotic fiction, and mainstream literature. His espionage fiction includes two series of note: &quot;Luc Ferran&quot; (16 novels), written under the pseudonym of &quot;Gil Darcy&quot; for the publisher L&#x27;Arabesque between 1963 and 1969; and &quot;Le Commander&quot; for Fleuve Noir&#x27;s magazine &quot;Espionnage&quot;, with about thirty novels written between 1967 and 1980. Arnaud also wrote non-series espionage novels under the pseudonyms of &quot;Saint-Gilles&quot; and &quot;Georges Murey&quot; for Ferenczi (1958–60) and L&#x27;Arabesque (1957–65), and another fifty-odd novels under his own name for Fleuve Noir&#x27;s &quot;Espionnage&quot; (1961–86).

Arnaud&#x27;s best known work is &quot;La Compagnie des glaces&quot; (&quot;The Ice Company&quot;), a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel series set in a new ice age where railway companies rule the world. &quot;La Compagnie des glaces&quot; was adapted during 2007 into a Canadian television series entitled &quot;Grand Star&quot;, and inspired the Japanese anime and manga series &quot;Overman King Gainer&quot;, which was distributed for 26 episodes from 2002 to 2003. The series also served as the basis for the computer game Transarctica (North American title: Arctic Baron). The first novel was translated into English in 2010 as &quot;The Ice Company&quot; ().

==Awards==
His work earned a number of awards, including:

* 1952 : Prix du Quai des Orfèvres for &quot;Ne tirez pas sur l&#x27;inspecteur&quot;
* 1966 : Palme d&#x27;Or du roman d&#x27;espionnage for &quot;Les égarés&quot;
* 1977 : Prix Mystère de la critique for &quot;Enfantasme&quot;
* 1988 : Prix Apollo for &quot;La Compagnie des glaces&quot;

<doc id="610472" wikidata="Q15030924" url="?curid=610472" title="The NewMusic">
<text>The NewMusic was a weekly Canadian music and culture television newsmagazine. 

Created by John Martin, and intended to combine the spirit of magazines like &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;New Musical Express&quot; with the format of a television newsmagazine, &quot;The NewMusic&quot; presented current popular music in a broad social, political and economic context. 

&#x27;The NewMusic&#x27; aired on several Canadian television stations including MuchMusic, MuchMoreMusic, Citytv, A-Channel and CP24.

== Origin story ==

&quot;The NewMusic&quot; was conceived in 1979 by Martin, who sought to create a program blending music with social and political commentary. Martin was frustrated by the lack of meaningful television coverage of music’s cultural impact, particularly during a time when youth culture was navigating major social shifts. He envisioned a program that treated music as a lens to explore issues like politics, identity, and activism.

Before finding a home for &quot;The NewMusic,&quot; Martin pitched the concept to CBC and CTV, but both networks passed, deeming it too unconventional for their audiences. Undeterred, Martin approached Moses Znaimer at Citytv, whose boundary-pushing ethos made it a perfect match for the program. Znaimer supported Martin&#x27;s vision, allowing him the creative freedom to produce what became a pioneering show.

The first episode aired on September 29, 1979, with hosts Jeanne Beker and J. D. Roberts. From the start, &quot;The NewMusic&quot; broke ground with on-location interviews and stories examining topics like censorship and activism, merging journalistic depth with the vibrancy of pop culture. Its success laid the foundation for MuchMusic, shaping Canadian music journalism for decades.

==Hosts==

== Notable interviews ==

&quot;The NewMusic&quot; interviewed many of the biggest names in popular music during its history including Bono, Robert Plant, Joe Strummer, members of Guns N&#x27; Roses, Chuck D, Jeff Buckley, Kate Bush, Peter Tosh, Tupac Shakur, Joni Mitchell, David Bowie, Thom Yorke, members of The Ramones, Courtney Love, members of Blur and many others. 

A few standout interviews delivered unforgettable exchanges between interviewer and guest.

* Sting - Jeanne Beker interviewed The Police frontman from the side of a bathtub as he bathed. 

* Iggy Pop - Jeanne Beker wrapped an interview with Pop early when the musician teased and taunted her, saying things like &quot;I have more talent than you could ever dream of.&quot;

* Johnny Rotten - The Sex Pistols frontman pelted Kim Clarke Champniss with grapes and walked out of his interview after taking issue with the line of questioning. He also told Champniss to &quot;shut up.&quot;

* Maurice Gibb - The Bee Gees&#x27; vocalist stormed out of a full band interview with Kim Clarke Champniss, visibly upset by questions that challenged the band&#x27;s legacy.

* Marianne Faithfull - Faithfull abruptly cut the interview short, asking Kim Clarke Champniss to wrap it up when she lost interest midway through. The reason for her sudden change of heart remains a mystery.

==Awards==

* 1992 - Best Light Information Series - Gemini Awards

* 2001 - Best Talk/General Information Series - Gemini Awards

* 2010 - Masterworks Honouree - Gemini Awards

==Cancellation and legacy==

In November 2008, &quot;The NewMusic&quot; was officially canceled after nearly 30 years on air, marking the end of a groundbreaking era in Canadian music journalism. The news came as part of wider layoff announcement from CTVglobemedia, owner of MuchMusic. The cancellation reflected broader industry shifts, as MuchMusic pivoted toward youth-oriented reality content amid declining budgets and changing viewer habits.

&quot;The NewMusic&quot; aired its final episode on November 17, 2008.

Several former hosts have commented on the program post-cancellation: 

* &quot;&quot;We really did look at it as the &#x27;60 Minutes&#x27; of music journalism. It was the opportunity to do our specials on media literacy, or gender, or issues of racism. Bigger more substantive storytelling that was based in music. And when you look at the legacy of &#x27;The NewMusic&#x27; it really was one of those shows from which so much great television and outstanding journalists and personalities came, people really cut their teeth on that show and went on to do wonderful new things after that.&quot; - Denise Donlon (speaking to Canoe.com)

* &quot;It was this golden era of television that I don&#x27;t think could ever be created again.&quot; - George Stroumboulopoulos (speaking to The Canadian Press)

* &quot;The NewMusic was very influential. It helped [us] take pop culture and rock music really seriously as something to be discussed and to think deeply about, for sure. And that permeates all of our culture today in media.&quot; - Hannah Sung (speaking to Exclaim! Magazine)

* &quot;It was groundbreaking; two kids from Toronto running around interviewing rock stars on smoky buses, hanging around backstage... We weren’t music journalists. Later I wasn’t a fashion journalist. It was entertainment reporting, first and foremost.&quot; - Jeanne Beker (speaking to the Toronto Star)

At the 25th Gemini Awards, the public was invited to vote for their favorite Canadian TV programs from the ceremony&#x27;s 25-year history. &quot;The NewMusic&quot; ranked 24th on that list.

<text>Séamus John James Given (born 20 April 1976) is an Irish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Widely regarded as one of the greatest Irish goalkeepers of all time and one of the best Premier League goalkeepers in his prime, he is the second-most-capped Republic of Ireland player with 134 caps. 

Given began his career at Celtic; however, he never made a first-team appearance. Released by Celtic, he was signed by Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in 1994. Whilst on loan from Blackburn, he was part of both the Sunderland team who won the Football League First Division title in 1995–96 and the Swindon Town team who won the Football League Second Division title that same season. He was signed by Newcastle United in 1997 for a fee of £2.5 million, and there he began competing to be a first-choice Premier League goalkeeper. Given was part of the teams who were runners-up in the 1998 and 1999 FA Cup campaigns, and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season for the 2001–02 and 2005–06 seasons. He played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup with Newcastle, and was involved in the club&#x27;s title challenge in 2001–02. Although he submitted a transfer request during the 2000–01 campaign after losing his position in the starting line-up, it was denied, and Given went on to regain his place.

On 1 February 2009, Given transferred to Manchester City for £6 million on a four-and-a-half-year contract. While Given was at Manchester City, the club, after finishing third in the Premier League, qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history, as well as winning the FA Cup – though he did not appear in the league in the campaign by which City reached the Champions League, nor did he play in the FA Cup. On 18 July 2011, he joined Aston Villa for a fee believed to be around £3.5 million, signing a five-year contract. Given joined Stoke City in July 2015, remaining with the club for two seasons.

Having surpassed the total of 100 caps required for membership, he is part of the FIFA Century Club. Given gained his first international cap in 1996 and played in goal during every match for his country during the 2002 FIFA World Cup campaign, helping them reach the knockout stage. He was later on the pitch in Paris when the Republic of Ireland were knocked out of the play-offs for a spot in the 2010 FIFA World Cup by France before helping his team qualify for UEFA Euro 2012. Given played at UEFA Euro 2012 and was selected in Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016, but did not appear in any of Ireland&#x27;s four matches at the tournament. Given is the second-highest capped Republic of Ireland player (after Robbie Keane). He announced his international retirement in July 2016, having amassed 134 caps for his country and kept 52 clean sheets.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Lifford, County Donegal, Given&#x27;s footballing career began at local amateur side Lifford Celtic, where he shot to notoriety for conceding seven goals on his debut. He was propelled into the limelight when he played in an FAI Junior Cup semi-final for Lifford Celtic. At 14, his performances for the club attracted attention from Scottish club Celtic, and he was invited to train with their youth side during a pre-season tour of Ireland in 1991. Given signed for the club a year later. Despite being named to the substitutes bench for the Old Firm derby against Rangers on 1 January 1994, Given never made a first-team appearance.

His performances for Celtic&#x27;s youth team did bring him to the attention of Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish, and he signed for the English side on a free transfer in the summer of 1994. Given revealed that Celtic offered him a one-year contract to stay at the club before moving to Blackburn Rovers.

===Blackburn Rovers===
The season after Given&#x27;s arrival saw Blackburn win the Premier League title and Given was unable to oust first-choice goalkeeper and England international Tim Flowers from the team. He made two loan moves to Swindon Town. Given acted as understudy during his first spell at the Wiltshire club, but helped them start their Championship-winning Second Division campaign during the 1995–96 season. He played in five games for Swindon before returning to Blackburn at the end of 1995. Given suffered an arm injury shortly after returning to Blackburn, but it turned out that the injury was &quot;not as bad as first feared&quot;.

Given was sent on loan again in January 1996, this time to First Division side Sunderland. Given kept 12 clean sheets during his 17 games for the club, and formed part of the team who won promotion to the Premier League as champions. 

Ahead of the 1996–97 season, Given was linked a move away from Blackburn, with Sunderland trying to re-sign him permanently. However, he stayed at the club throughout the summer transfer window, with manager Ray Harford intended to keep him and told him to challenge Flowers for the first-choice goalkeeper role. Blackburn even offered Given a new three-year contract to stay at the club. However, Given continued to be Blackburn&#x27;s second-choice goalkeeper behind Flowers. He made his debut for the club on 24 September 1996, coming on as an 86th minute substitute in Blackburn&#x27;s 2–0 win against Brentford in the second leg of the League Cup second round. Following an injury to Flowers, Given made his Premier League debut in Blackburn&#x27;s 1–0 defeat at Wimbledon on 14 December 1996. He then kept his first Premier League clean sheet in a 0–0 draw against Derby County on 28 December. It was later revealed that Given did not sign the contract offered to him and intended to leave at the end of the 1996–97 season due to a lack of first team football. This led him to put a transfer request, even it was unlikely to leave the club in the January transfer window.

His performances on loan impressed Kenny Dalglish, who had recently been appointed manager of Newcastle United, and prompted him to sign Given again. But the Magpies faced competitions from Sunderland, Celtic, and Liverpool. Given signed for the North-East club in the summer of 1997 for a fee of £1.5 million following an independent tribunal, as Given was under the age of 23 at the time.

===Newcastle United===
====1997–2001====
Given was one of the first signings of then-newly appointed manager Dalglish. Given made his debut in Newcastle&#x27;s 2–1 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday on 9 August 1997 and immediately established himself in the first team, beating fellow goalkeepers Pavel Srníček, Shaka Hislop and Steve Harper to the position. Newcastle advanced to the final of the FA Cup, and Given played the whole match as the team were defeated 2–0 by league champions Arsenal. The club also progressed to the final the following year, but Given was replaced by Harper as Newcastle lost 2–0 in the final, this time to Manchester United.

In November 1997, Given conceded a strange goal against Coventry City when, after collecting a cross, he rolled the ball out in preparation to make a long clearance. However, he had forgotten that Coventry striker Dion Dublin was still behind him, and Dublin quickly took advantage of the situation by rolling the ball into the empty net. The coincidence of the goalscorer&#x27;s name quickly led to the popular joke among football fans that Given &quot;is the only Irishman who doesn&#x27;t know where Dublin is&quot; and the goal itself is still regularly featured on lists compiled of bizarre goals.

Given submitted a written transfer request in December 2000 after failing to regain his place in the first team from Harper after a thigh injury had ruled him out of a match against Leeds United. Manager Bobby Robson stated at the time: &quot;A lot of clubs have a very good goalkeeper and one who stands by. I think we have two keepers — and Harper is proving that — who can play in the Premiership&quot;. The club rejected Given&#x27;s request and he later withdrew it, stating that his &quot;intention was simply to express [his] frustration at being left out of the team,&quot; and that he &quot;never had any intention of actually leaving the club.&quot; An injury to Harper led to Given being recalled to the first team, and he kept his place for the rest of the season.

====2001–2004====
In the 2001–02 season, Given played in every Premier League match as Newcastle&#x27;s previously unexpected title challenge ended in a fourth-place finish in the league. A highlight of the season was Given saving a Fabrizio Ravanelli penalty in a 1–0 win over Derby County on 24 November 2001. Given was selected in the PFA Team of the Year and Newcastle&#x27;s league position meant that they would enter the qualifying stages of the UEFA Champions League the following season.

The next season, Given again found himself competing with Harper. After a 5–0 qualifying round win, Newcastle progressed to the group stages of the Champions League. He played in the first three group matches, all of which Newcastle lost. Harper then replaced Given for the next two games. Given returned for the final group match against Feyenoord in the Netherlands, and Newcastle&#x27;s 3–2 win meant that they qualified for the second round. Internazionale scored four times past Given as Newcastle lost 4–1 in their opening match in the second group stage. Newcastle conceded a further three times away to Barcelona, beat Bayer Leverkusen at home and in Germany (with Given saving an Oliver Neuville penalty in the home tie), and drew with Inter at the San Siro, however a 2–0 loss at home against Barcelona meant that the club finished third in their group and failed to qualify for the knockout stages. Given played every game in the second round. Given played all 38 league games for the club, as well as his twelve European appearances, as the team finished in third place in the Premier League, meaning the club would enter the Champions League qualifying round in the 2003–04 season.

Having finished third in the league in May 2003, Given and Newcastle lost 4–3 on penalties to Partizan Belgrade early in the 2003–04 season, meaning that Newcastle failed to reach the group stages of the Champions League. The club instead qualified for the UEFA Cup, where they reached the semi-finals. A fifth-place finish in the league meant that the club qualified for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup competition. Given played in every one of the club&#x27;s league matches for a third successive season, as well as all thirteen European games.

====2004–2006====
After a poor start to the 2004–05 season, Graeme Souness replaced Bobby Robson as Newcastle manager. Given overtook Alan Shearer as having played in the most European matches for the club on 16 September 2004 in a game against Bnei Sakhnin, and Given&#x27;s twelve European and three FA Cup appearances helped Newcastle reach the UEFA Cup quarter-final and the FA Cup semi-final. Given missed two Premier League games as the club finished in 14th place.

Although the club entered the Intertoto Cup in the 2005–06 season, a defeat by Spanish club Deportivo de La Coruña meant that they did not qualify for further European competition that season. Given played in all of the club&#x27;s league matches as they finished in seventh position and he signed a new five-year contract with the club in the summer. His performances for Newcastle led to Given being named in the Premier League&#x27;s Team of the Season. Given played in all of the club&#x27;s FA Cup games as they reached the quarter-finals, and captained the team for three games during Shearer&#x27;s absence.

On 17 September 2006, Given suffered a one-centimetre tear in his bowel after a tackle by West Ham United striker Marlon Harewood. Doctors likened the injury to one more likely to happen in a car crash. Manager Glenn Roeder signed ex-Newcastle veteran Pavel Srníček as cover for Steve Harper, and youth goalkeeper Tim Krul played a full match in Newcastle&#x27;s 1–0 UEFA Cup win at Palermo on 2 November. Given returned on 18 November for Newcastle&#x27;s 1–1 draw at Arsenal.

====2007–2009====
Given made his 400th appearance for the club on 1 January 2007 in a 2–2 draw against Manchester United. He ended the 2006–07 season with 22 league appearances as the club finished in 13th place, and reached the last 16 of the UEFA Cup.

Given&#x27;s 2007–08 season was prematurely ended by injury in February 2008 when he had a re-occurrence of a previous groin injury in the 5–1 home defeat by Manchester United.

The opening months of Newcastle&#x27;s 2008–09 season were blighted by ownership and managerial turmoil, as well as numerous injury problems. This manifested itself on the pitch as the club struggled to direct itself clear of the relegation zone. However, a highlight was Given saving a Kevin Nolan penalty in a 1–0 win over Bolton Wanderers. On 2 January 2009, following a 5–1 defeat at home against Liverpool, Given&#x27;s lawyer released a statement saying that Given was &quot;considering his future&quot; at Newcastle, and requested permission to talk to representatives of Manchester City on 28 January after the club made a bid of £5 million which was subsequently rejected. Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear had already stated that the club was &quot;not interested at all in selling him&quot;, and described the amount on offer for Given as &quot;insulting&quot;. However, on 30 January, it was reported that Newcastle had given permission for Given to enter talks with Manchester City. After a transfer fee initially reported to be around £8 million was agreed between the clubs, Given signed for Manchester City on 1 February, with the transfer window set to close the following day. Although the fee for Given was expected to be around £8 million, in February 2009, Newcastle managing director Derek Llambias revealed at a supporters panel meeting that Given had been sold for an initial £5.9 million. Given was 34 games away from breaking Newcastle&#x27;s appearance record held by Jimmy Lawrence.

===Manchester City===
On 1 February 2009, Given signed for Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year contract for £6 million. He was formally introduced as a Manchester City player on 5 February 2009, and was assigned squad number 37. In the subsequent press conference, he criticised Newcastle&#x27;s management for not trying hard enough to keep him at the club. He also said that &quot;By coming here I thought I could be at a club that is challenging for honours. I didn&#x27;t want to finish my career regretting not taking up this offer.&quot; Given kept a clean sheet in a man of the match performance in his debut, a 1–0 win against Middlesbrough on 7 February.

With Joe Hart leaving the club on loan, Given was given the squad number 1 for the 2009–10 season. He made his 400th league appearance on 5 October 2009 against Aston Villa. On 1 November 2009, he saved a James McFadden penalty to help his side draw 0–0 at Birmingham City. On 5 December 2009, he made an outstanding penalty save from Frank Lampard to deny Chelsea an equalising goal. City went on to win 2–1. The same month, &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; football correspondent Henry Winter named Given as &quot;Premier League Goalkeeper of the Noughties&quot;. While team captain Kolo Touré was on international duty, Given was given the captain&#x27;s armband by manager Roberto Mancini, who described him as &quot;one of the five best goalkeepers in the world&quot;. He dislocated his shoulder during a match against Arsenal on 24 April, ruling him out for the rest of the season.

On 14 August 2010, Given was dropped from the Manchester City starting eleven for their opening league game against Tottenham Hotspur and replaced by Hart, who became City&#x27;s permanent first choice goalkeeper. Given&#x27;s only domestic appearance during the 2010–11 season came in a defeat to West Bromwich Albion in the League Cup; he also played in three Europa League matches.

===Aston Villa===
On 18 July 2011, Given joined Aston Villa for a fee believed to be around £3.5 million. He signed a five-year deal, meaning that he would be 40 when his contract expired. Given made his Villa debut in a pre-season friendly victory over Walsall on 21 July. He was substituted at half time for Andy Marshall, when the score was 2–0 to Villa. On 13 August 2011, Given played his first Premier League match for Aston Villa against Fulham in a 0–0 draw. In September 2011, Given was reunited with Terry Gennoe at Aston Villa. After four years out of the game, Gennoe was named as the new first team goalkeeping coach, replacing Rafa González. He had previously coached Given at Blackburn and Newcastle. On 3 December, Given suffered a torn hamstring, which sidelined him until January.

After a disappointing start to the 2012–13 season, Given lost his first team place to Brad Guzan after two league games. However, on 5 January 2013, he appeared in a 2–1 home win against Ipswich Town in an FA Cup third round match. Three days later, Given also played for Villa in a 3–1 away defeat against Bradford City in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final match. Despite winning the second leg 2–1, Villa were eliminated from the competition.

On 15 April 2014, Given was appointed temporary assistant to Paul Lambert after the club suspended Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa, pending an internal investigation for an undisclosed reason. Given played in all of Aston Villa&#x27;s FA Cup fixtures that led to an appearance in the 2015 FA Cup final at the age of 39, which Villa lost 4–0 to Arsenal. The Cup run began with a 1–0 victory over Blackpool, and continued with 2–1 victories over both AFC Bournemouth and Leicester City, and a 2–0 win over derby rivals West Bromwich Albion. In the semi-final, Villa came from a goal down to defeat Liverpool 2–1, putting the club in their first FA Cup final since 2000.

====Loan to Middlesbrough====
Given joined Middlesbrough on a one-month loan deal on 28 November 2013 as cover for the injured Jason Steele. Given&#x27;s initial one-month loan deal was extended to the end of February 2014 and ultimately, he made his last appearance for Middlesbrough on 22 February in a 0–0 draw against Leeds United. Whilst at Middlesbrough, Given kept ten clean sheets in 16 league games.

===Stoke City===
Given signed a two-year contract with Stoke City on 10 July 2015. Given joined as backup to first choice goalkeeper Jack Butland. He made his debut on 25 August 2015 in a 1–1 draw with Luton Town in the League Cup, Stoke winning on penalties. He missed most of Stoke&#x27;s 2015–16 campaign after needing to undergo knee surgery in October 2015. Given returned towards the end of the campaign and due to injury to Butland, he shared goalkeeping duties with Jakob Haugaard.

Given began the 2016–17 season as first-choice due to an injury to Butland. On 27 August 2016, he conceded an own goal in a 1–0 away defeat to Everton. Given had palmed a Leighton Baines penalty onto the post but the ball rebounded against his head and went over the line. After conceding four goals against Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace in September, Given lost his place in the side to Lee Grant. He was released by Stoke at the end of the 2016–17 season.

On 21 April 2018, the day after his 42nd birthday, Given announced his retirement from professional football whilst receiving an award for Donegal Person of the Year in Dublin.

==International career==
Given represented the Republic of Ireland at youth level before earning five caps for the Republic of Ireland national under-21 team. Although he did not become a regular first team player for Blackburn, Given&#x27;s performances while on loan at Swindon and Sunderland led to him being called up to the Republic of Ireland squad in 1996. He made his debut for the national team on 27 March 1996, in a game against Russia. Due to his lack of playing time at Blackburn Rovers in the 1996–97 season, manager Mick McCarthy dropped him from the squad.

Although Ireland failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup or UEFA Euro 2000, Given established himself as first-choice goalkeeper. He played in all of his nation&#x27;s games at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. With draws against Cameroon and Germany and a 3–0 win against Saudi Arabia, the team reached the second round of the competition. Meeting Spain in the knockout round, Ireland forced penalties with the score at 1–1 at the end of extra time. Three missed penalties for Ireland ended their participation in the tournament, and Spain progressed to the next round.

Given was part of the team for most of the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign; however a draw with Switzerland meant Ireland failed to qualify for the finals of the competition in Germany. He equalled Packie Bonner&#x27;s record of 80 caps against Slovakia on 28 March 2007. Given obtained his 100th cap against Montenegro at Croke Park, Dublin on 14 October 2009 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying game. Ireland reached a qualifying play-off against France, but were controversially eliminated by a goal scored after Thierry Henry handled the ball.

Given was part of the team that secured qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 with a play-off victory against Estonia. Given played in the Euro 2012 championship as Ireland were eliminated in the group stage.

===Retirement, comeback and second retirement===
On 13 August 2012, Given announced on Twitter his decision to retire from international football, describing it as an &quot;unforgettable experience&quot; to play for his country. Given retired holding the record for the most capped Irishman, though Robbie Keane was closing in on the record.

Due to Given&#x27;s lack of playing time with his club Aston Villa, there was speculation that he would make himself available for selection as part of Ireland&#x27;s 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. On 14 January 2013, it was announced that Given was once again available for international selection.

On 30 August 2014, still not having played a league game with Aston Villa, three games into the 2014–15 Premier League season, he was selected by Martin O&#x27;Neill in his 27-man squad for a friendly against Oman and Ireland&#x27;s first Euro 2016 qualifier in Georgia. It came after a two-year international absence, after retiring following the disappointing Euro 2012, where Ireland failed to progress from the group stages. He was one of four goalkeepers in the squad. On 2 September 2014, Given made his first start for Ireland since the Euros in a 2–0 win against Oman. However, he did not start against Georgia in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first competitive game with David Forde getting the nod. Ireland won 2–1 in Tbilisi thanks to an Aiden McGeady brace. On 18 November 2014, Given started the 4–1 win against the United States in Dublin.

On 29 March 2015, Given regained his place in the starting line-up for the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland. The game finished 1–1 with Shane Long scoring a last minute equaliser. On 8 October 2015, Given suffered a knee injury and had to be stretchered off after 44 minutes against the 2014 FIFA World Cup winners Germany in what turned out to be a memorable night for Ireland as they prevailed with a 1–0 win.

On 31 May 2016, Given became Ireland&#x27;s longest-serving player after appearing in the 2–1 home defeat to Belarus. He eclipsed Johnny Giles&#x27; record of 19 years and 202 days and became the first Irishman to play for his country for 20 years or more. He was selected in the 23-man Ireland squad for Euro 2016 but did not feature in any match at the tournament.

On 28 July 2016, Given announced his retirement from international football for the second and final time. He gave all his international playing fees to charity.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League in his prime and one of the best goalkeepers in Irish footballing history, Given was considered to be an agile, athletic, resolute and courageous goalkeeper, with excellent reflexes, anticipation, shot stopping abilities, and a good command of his area, in spite of not being particularly tall, although at times he had been accused in the media of not being particularly effective at dealing with crosses.

==Coaching career==

In June 2018, Given was appointed goalkeeping coach at Derby County under new manager Frank Lampard. He retained his position when Phillip Cocu was appointed manager in July 2019. In November 2020, Given was part of an interim coaching quartet alongside Wayne Rooney, Liam Rosenior and Justin Walker after Cocu was sacked earlier that month. After two matches as an interim quartet, Rooney would go on to take sole charge. On 15 January 2021, Rooney was appointed as the club&#x27;s permanent manager and Given moved to the position of first-team coach. Given left his role at Derby at the end of the season because the club&#x27;s financial problems meant they could not afford to renew it.

==Personal life==
Given has been in a relationship with Rebecca Gibson since 2013, and the couple have two daughters. In 2006, Given was awarded the Freedom of County Donegal in a ceremony in his home town, Lifford.

Given has helped to organise several fundraising events in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. His mother died of cancer when he was four, so he has continually tried to raise money as it is an issue close to him. On 27 November 2011, Given was brought to tears during a minute&#x27;s applause for former teammate and personal friend Gary Speed, following Speed&#x27;s death earlier that day, before Aston Villa met Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.

<text>John Paul Wild (17 May 192310 May 2008) was a British-born Australian scientist. Following service in World War II as a radar officer in the Royal Navy, he became a radio astronomer in Australia for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the fore-runner of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). In the 1950s and 1960s he made discoveries based on radio observations of the Sun. In the late 1960s and early 1970s his team built and operated the world&#x27;s first solar radio-spectrographs and subsequently the Culgoora radio-heliograph, near Narrabri, New South Wales. The Paul Wild Observatory at Culgoora is named after him.

In 1972 Paul Wild invented Interscan, a standard microwave landing system. From 1978 to 1985 he was chairman of CSIRO, during which time he expanded the organisation&#x27;s scope and directed its restructuring. He retired from CSIRO to lead (from 1986) the Very Fast Train Joint Venture, a private sector project that sought to build a high-speed railway between Australia&#x27;s two most populous cities. Lack of support from government brought it to an end in 1991. In his later years he worked on gravitational theory.

==Early life==
John Paul Wild was born in Sheffield, England on 17 May 1923, the fourth son of wealthy cutlery manufacturer, Alwyn Wild, and his wife Bessie. But in that year, Alwyn&#x27;s business collapsed and he went to the United States of America to sell his patents and technology for cutlery manufacture. In the event, he never returned. Bessie moved with her boys to Croydon, near London. About this Wild said &quot;We went from riches to rags and the family was absolutely struggling&quot; and &quot;... right on the breadline, very, very poor.&quot; It was to be five or six years before a divorce settlement allowed the family to &quot;live a reasonable middle-class life, reasonably well off&quot;.

His childhood was a happy one, with his &quot;imperialistic grandfather&quot; having a strong influence in his upbringing. At age six he was hospitalised for six months after being hit by a lorry when alighting from a tram, cracking his skull. Then at age seven he attended a Sussex boarding school, Ardingly College, the youngest boy in the school and very homesick. But after successfully &quot;plotting to get out&quot; with his elder brother for four terms he spent the rest of his schooling at Croydon: first at The Limes (Old Palace of John Whitgift School) – at that time a preparatory school – then at the associated senior independent school, Whitgift School.

The driving intellectual curiosity that was to distinguish Paul Wild was evident from an early age. He said, &quot;[My mother] showed great appreciation if ever I was successful in anything but she didn&#x27;t push me.&quot; He was interested in building things with model house kits, Meccano and cardboard; an early gift of a Hornby train from his mother started him on his lifelong love of trains. Then he &quot;read about the great man Isambard Kingdom Brunel and all his works, which were not only railways but the extraordinary ships that he built at the time. Well, I suppose he was the first source of inspiration to me.&quot;

He became an avid player and follower of cricket while at school and into adulthood: in his later life he was known as &quot;a walking encyclopaedia of cricket knowledge&quot;, eventually owning all but one edition of &quot; Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;.

Wild developed a strong love of mathematics from a very early age. After matriculating he spent three years in the mathematical sixth form, most of the time on mathematics, with a little physics and world affairs. In free periods he and his friends would play bridge, under the chestnut trees in summertime. In an interview in 1992 he said: &quot;We had three specialist mathematics teachers covering analysis, calculus and modern geometry, and I think I owe a lot to them.&quot;

Whitgift School is near what was then Croydon Aerodrome. In the summer of 1940, real excitement was added to the lives of the bridge-playing mathematics students: the Battle of Britain was going on overhead. &quot;There was no sense of danger, it was all marvellous fun. Croydon [a Spitfire and Hurricane base] was right in the thick of it, and we used to watch the air battles going on.&quot;

==Physics by accident==
World War II determined Paul Wild&#x27;s specialisation and intruded to foreshorten his entire university life to only five terms. In 1942, Wild went to the University of Cambridge (Peterhouse) to further his mathematics. However, after a year of mathematics he knew that he would only be able to stay on if he did something relevant to the national war effort. Thus he went straight into &quot;physics with radio&quot;: Part 2 Physics. He saidthe great majority of people in Part 2 Physics had already done two years of it before, so it was a real challenge. But I enjoyed it very much, and I was very inspired by the sort of grandeur of the approach, the wonders of quantum mechanics and relativity …. It was hard work, it was six days a week. That&#x27;s how I became a physicist.

After the second year, having concluded five terms in all, he had a choice of joining one of the three armed services or going into radar research or industry. On his &quot;free&quot; day each week he had been trained in the Home Guard, but his great interest in ships and the sea led him to join the Royal Navy. A wartime Bachelor of Arts degree was conferred a year later. A few years afterwards he paid five pounds to become a Master of Arts. Then ten years after that, he sent his research papers to the University of Cambridge and following a two-year deliberation the degree of Doctor of Science was conferred.

==Wartime naval service==
Paul Wild became one of the young radar officers who ensured the Royal Navy used its new technology to maximum effect. In July 1943, commissioned as a Probationary Temporary Acting Sub-lieutenant (Special Branch, Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve), he started an intensive, six-month radar officer training course at the Royal Navy base, Portsmouth. His seagoing appointment for the following two and a half years, with 60 subordinates and 24 radar sets, was the battleship , which eventually became flagship of the British Pacific Fleet. The ship took part in the Okinawa campaign, followed by the assault on the Japanese mainland. In both campaigns the fleet was frequently attacked by Japanese suicide bombers, but because they tended to concentrate on aircraft carriers, his ship was not hit. The battleship entered Tokyo Bay just after the surrender of Japan and he was present when the peace treaty was signed.

The Royal Navy was innovative in the way it incorporated information from the ship&#x27;s new radar into its gunnery, with a direct line of communication from the radar officer to the bridge. Wild described the thrill of seeing range-finding projectiles on his cathode ray oscilloscope in the darkened radar room, appearing as spikes straddling the target, then the third shot hitting the target in the middle.

Despite the Royal Navy&#x27;s innovation in its use of radar, an underlying aversion to new technology persisted among some senior naval officers. He recalled a remark by his admiral at the end of hostilities: &quot;Now we can get back, young Wild, to being a proper navy – without your radar&quot;.

On returning to England, Wild taught radar to permanent naval officers until early 1947. During one of his wartime breaks in Australia he had become engaged to a young Sydney woman, Elaine Hull, whose family had offered hospitality; and on leaving the Royal Navy he immediately sailed for Sydney. He had asked his fiancée to go to England to be married, but she told him he would have to settle in Australia. As his future brother-in-law later observed, &quot;Australia has my sister to thank for giving this country one of its greatest scientists&quot;.

==&quot;Humble&quot; start in Australia==
From London, Wild had obtained an assistant research officer job with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at the Radiophysics Laboratory near Sydney. He described the position as &quot;a humble one&quot;: to maintain and develop test equipment. But within a year he had, as he put it, &quot;wheedled his way&quot; into the new science of radio astronomy, and he described 1948–50 as a tremendously exciting time... The only two really powerful groups in radio astronomy were the Australian one and Cambridge; and... we all thought we had the edge over the Cambridge group. [Australian wartime radio expert] Joe Pawsey was the sort of father of radio astronomy in Australia. He was a wonderfully inspiring leader, very self-effacing and taking no credit for himself, and he was a delight to work under. And he did something which I appreciated greatly: he left me alone to do my own research but I could come to him at any time and get his advice.This advice, Wild acknowledged, &quot;was often very perceptive, very good&quot;. Pawsey&#x27;s approach became a template that Wild would follow.

In the 15 years from 1949, the solar group that Wild had joined and which he soon came to lead achieved an international reputation in solar radiophysics. Their instruments revealed for the first time the presence of charged particles and shock waves travelling through the solar corona, and their potential effects on &quot;space weather&quot;. The group&#x27;s innovative design of observation equipment and ground-breaking investigations into the nature of solar radio bursts and the disturbances that gave rise to them cleared the way to classifying most types of bursts by their spectral appearance and presenting models to interpret their characteristics.

==Solar burst discoveries==
The new breed of electronic astronomers that Paul Wild joined were applying their wartime skills to radiophysics research, the Radiophysics Laboratory having achieved a number of successes since it was established, early in the war, to bring radar to Australia. In 1948, groups at the laboratory were studying several fields in addition to solar. Wild&#x27;s work arose from the phenomenon of embryonic radar technology sometimes being jammed by mysterious interference, later discovered, in England, to be radio noise coming from the Sun.

When Wild joined the solar group there were two teams from which to choose. He chose to work for Lindsay McCready in building a radiospectrograph, at the suggestion of Pawsey. As he later said, &quot;I knew if I joined McCready I would be able to do my own thing … That&#x27;s why I became a solar man&quot;.

The spectrograph – the first ever built – looked at the spectrum of bursts of radiations from the Sun over a wide spectral range for frequencies from 40 to 70 megahertz. It produced some spectacular results, demonstrating the great complexity of burst and storm phenomena. At Penrith, 50 kilometres west of Sydney in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, a fairly primitive wooden aerial was pulled around with ropes, and every twenty minutes it was changed so that it pointed towards the Sun. The data were analysed after four months of observations. In the first paper, published in 1950, he wrote: &quot;We have identified three distinct spectral types of burst and … we shall call them Type I, Type II and Type III.&quot;

Wild&#x27;s team now needed a site for a new, better engineered and more powerful radiospectrograph and a large swept-frequency interferometer with which to observe the radio source. In September 1950, he and three colleagues borrowed a decrepit ex-military ambulance and with a spectrum analyser assessed potential sites on the outskirts of Sydney and down the New South Wales south coast that would be least affected by interference from radio transmissions. They chose a grazing property outside Dapto, 15 kilometres south of Wollongong, shielded by a 1500-foot mountain. Here the Radiophysics Solar Group went from strength to strength, to the extent that Wild later said &quot;there was no question that we were the world champions&quot;. Professor Marcel Minnaert, the eminent Belgian astronomer, wrote in 1963:The history of solar radio-spectroscopy is mainly the history of Australian work on this subject. ... At each meeting of the International Astronomical Union, highly competent specialists such as Wild [and Smerd and Christianson, headed by Pawsey] … were able to announce spectacular progress.

This work was done in primitive buildings and facilities. The equipment hut comprised a minute workshop at one end, an office in the middle and another minute room at the other end, used as a kitchen and after-work gathering place while dinner was prepared: after returning from the pub, conversation would be animated as one of them hammered veal then cooked wiener schnitzel in an atmosphere &quot;thick with fug&quot;. Staff members, who spent several days per week there, slept and ate in an adjacent single-roomed weatherboard hut with a table down the middle and camp stretchers around the sides. But among these achievers, morale and excitement was very high and their social life was lively. Colleagues from the days at Dapto, describing Wild – as many did – as &quot;colleague, mentor and good friend&quot; said &quot; He could light up a room with his wit, intelligence and charm. He loved a party and a few beers.&quot;

The bursts were distinguished by the way the frequency drifted with time. The team deduced that the type II bursts were associated with shock waves coming out through the solar atmosphere at 1000 km/s and were associated, 30 hours later, with aurora in the Earth&#x27;s night sky. They had discovered the answer to a century-old riddle: what was the agency that conveyed the disturbance from the solar flare to the Earth? Type II bursts continue to be closely monitored by spectrographs on the ground and in satellites for &quot;space weather&quot; reporting, since their disruption of the geomagnetic field and ionosphere can cause blackouts to radio communication and the systems of navigational and other satellites.

Wild&#x27;s team associated type III bursts with streams of electrons being ejected at a third the speed of light and taking less than half an hour to reach the Earth. There remained a few sceptics about this interpretation until, a decade or so later, American physicists using satellite data regularly detected bursts of electrons 25 minutes or so after solar flares. This was just one component, but to Wild and his colleagues a very exciting one, of a much wider world-leading research program.

The mechanisms proved to be correct and their naming of the phenomena became the international standard. Wild likened this research to the study of taxonomy that preceded Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of species&quot;. His analysis of the anatomy of the solar flares and his development of the physical interpretation culminated in a unified model that integrated the apparently complex radio flare phenomena in the solar chromosphere, solar corona, and in the interplanetary space.

In the course of this solar work, Wild became interested in the radio spectrum of hydrogen and wrote up an internal report related to the potential for spectral lines in the solar bursts. When Ewen and Purcell in the US first observed the 1420 MHz transition in 1951, he went back to his report, generalised it to include the interstellar medium, and six months later published the first detailed theoretical paper on the hydrogen lines – a classic in the field.

==World lead in solar research==
Wild&#x27;s team then built and from 1967 operated a three-kilometre diameter radio-heliograph at Culgoora, near Narrabri in northern New South Wales. It was to become a ground-breaking instrument producing real-time images of solar activity across a range of altitudes from the Sun&#x27;s surface. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the team led the world in solar research, attracting prominent solar physicists from around the world.

Until then, all results from the solar radio-spectrographs had been inferred from studying the Sun by looking at its spectrum with only very limited angular resolution. Wild wanted to actually see what these phenomena looked like on the Sun, actually get a moving picture of them. The frequency range that we were interested in was around about the metre wavelengths. To get the resolution roughly equivalent to that of the human eye at these long wavelengths required an aperture some three kilometres in diameter. So I devised a method of synthesising a three kilometre aperture with 96 antennas in a ring.

With Pawsey&#x27;s help, £630,000 was raised from the Ford Foundation to build the Culgoora radio-heliograph. Years later he was to admit &quot;When I think back I wonder how I had the nerve to do it.&quot; The heliograph stayed in operation for 17 years from 1967, providing a huge amount of data and insight into the way the solar corona works and the relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena. Wild published more than 70 papers in this field. The heliograph also played a leading supporting role in both the Skylab missions of 1973–74 and the solar maximum mission of 1980–81, providing real-time observations of coronal activity. It was de-commissioned in 1984 to make way for the Australia Telescope and transferred to the Ionospheric Prediction Service, where it is still used today for space weather monitoring of solar activity. Now there are at least 20 ground-based radio-spectrographs operating around the world.

Although Wild wrote most of the papers, he was characteristically generous in giving credit to others, saying &quot;I did put other people&#x27;s names on them because they&#x27;d made important contributions&quot;. One, for example, was technical assistant Bill Rowe. During a period when the solar cycle was at a minimum and nothing was happening, Rowe drove down to Dapto for an 11 am appointment. Wild remarked: Out of sheer conscientiousness he arrived at 8 am, switched on the gear and recorded the most magnificent outburst, which led to the discovery of first and second harmonics. Well, you couldn&#x27;t write a paper without putting his name on it.

As he had with John Murray at Dapto, Wild always acknowledged chief electronics engineer Kevin Sheridan as the key figure in the facility&#x27;s development: &quot;Kevin and I became like Gilbert and Sullivan; we were both dependent on each other a great deal.&quot;

The Culgoora site later became the home for the Paul Wild Observatory, opened in 1988 and now a site for several major astronomical facilities.

Wild was always keen to pass on his enthusiasm for science. With George Gamow and instigator Harry Messel, he was a member of the inaugural trio who, from 1962, brought high-level science teaching to senior secondary students throughout Australia. Titled &quot;Summer School of Science&quot;, the sessions were televised live at the University of Sydney and re-broadcast in three-hour programs early every Sunday morning – a fore-runner of the programs of today&#x27;s Professor Harry Messel International Science School.

==Researcher and administrator==
In 1971, Paul Wild took over from E.G. &#x27;Taffy&#x27; Bowen as chief of CSIRO&#x27;s Division of Radiophysics. For someone who joined a particular research team so that he could &quot;do his own thing&quot;, it may be surprising that he agreed to be appointed to this role. He explained his motivation: Well all my life, scientific life, people have given me lots of resources and lots of opportunities and I think it&#x27;s a matter of duty; when the finger is pointed to you it&#x27;s your duty to pay back some of those wonderful things that have been given. That&#x27;s how I became an administrator. [But] when I was Chief of Division I was not merely an administrator, because I also led a research group on the Interscan landing system.

That Interscan was an applied research group was no accident. In fact he had perceived a problem inherent in the Division of Radiophysics being solely involved in pure research – a situation that had never applied in CSIRO. He felt it was very important to &quot;demonstrate to everyone that one could turn this technology into something useful.&quot;

==Interscan==
In looking for applied research opportunities, Wild discovered that the Australian Department of Civil Aviation had been considering a call by the International Civil Aviation Organization for member states to propose a new system to replace the longstanding Instrument Landing System. He very quickly formed the concept of a microwave landing system and applied his energies to the project with great enthusiasm. The concept was simple: a radar fan beam scans back and forth horizontally while another scans up and down, giving the aircraft&#x27;s position within a few inches.

Interscan proved to have many advantages over other precision landing systems. It allows a wide selection of channels to avoid interference with other nearby airports; has excellent performance in all weather; and gives freedom to locate antennae anywhere at an airport. Some installations became operational in the 1990s and more were set up subsequently in Europe. NASA has operated a similar system to land Space Shuttles. However, Interscan has not become widely deployed worldwide, largely because the US Federal Aviation Administration has developed the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which augments the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). Although WAAS is cheaper and conforms to ILS Category I, its accuracy is under 1.0 metre laterally and under 1.5 metres vertically, which is a particular concern at locations that frequently suffer from low visibility.

In 1978, Interscan was accepted as the new global standard in microwave landing systems – but only after many international political hurdles had been overcome. The project involved long, delicate negotiations with the International Civil Aviation Organization and pragmatic alliances with other nations. It was during the ICAO negotiations, and as chief of his CSIRO division, that Wild was revealed as a highly talented diplomat and political strategist. Dennis Cooper, a key participant in the ICAO negotiations, described Wild as &quot;an excellent mentor, happy to listen to the ideas of young colleagues, able to grasp complex ideas and explain them simply&quot;.

==National science leadership==
In 1978, Wild became chairman of CSIRO, a position he held until 1985, and for part of that tenure was also its chief executive. He took on the role after the first Independent Inquiry into CSIRO (the Birch Report of 1977) pointed the organisation towards &quot;filling a gap in national research with strategic mission-oriented work.&quot; He led the organisation through the restructure to modernise it and bring it closer to the industries and community that it serves.

This role, especially, invoked a sense of duty that had its roots during and before Wild&#x27;s naval service. When asked in 1992 whether his appointment as Chairman rested &quot;to an extent on the fact that you had put the division, and Australia, on the international map and you had this capacity for applying very fundamental work?&quot;, he responded, &quot;Yes, I think it certainly must have done. I don&#x27;t know that I &quot;really&quot; wanted the job, but it was a duty to take the job when they offered it to you.&quot;
Wild recognised that CSIRO needed to adapt and provide scientific and technological leadership in a changing world, reflecting his maxim that &quot;without excellence and originality, research achieves nothing.&quot; During this period of great change he secured funding for major national research facilities, including the oceanographic research vessel, RV &quot;Franklin&quot;; the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and the Australia Telescope; and he established a new Division of Information Technology.

But many things did not involve smooth sailing: for example, as he put it, &quot;I had terrible trouble over the Animal Health Laboratory when he [Wild&#x27;s somewhat interventionist science minister, Barry Jones] wanted to close it all down, just when it was nearly finished being built.&quot; Further, CSIRO for the first time had to react to public criticism about its policies. Wild said &quot;Before that time … I suppose CSIRO was a sacred cow, beyond criticism; and I think we had to get used to criticism and get used to defending.&quot;

He explained his particular ethos and style of management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken side by side in the same laboratory... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you&#x27;re in charge of an organisation that&#x27;s spending a million dollars of taxpayers&#x27; money every day, and that&#x27;s a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO&#x27;s chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst &quot;the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms.&quot;

The diplomacy and political strategy that Wild had first used to major advantage in negotiations with the International Civil Aviation Organization, combined with his intellectual rigour and a deeply ingrained focus on doing what was right, served CSIRO and Australia well until he retired from CSIRO, aged 62, in 1985.

==&quot;Very Fast Train Joint Venture&quot;==

=== Inspiration, conceptualization and initial studies (1983-1987) ===
In October 1983, Wild made a trip from Canberra to a CSIRO meeting in Sydney using the XPT, which was introduced the year prior. He would remark that:&quot;despite the train&#x27;s much publicized but very brief dash at 160 km/h, the journey, over all, had the leisurely features of a branch-line train. [...] In the end, the journey took 4 hours and 37 minutes – 20 minutes longer than scheduled, at an average speed of 70.6 km/h. I was absolutely appalled by the whole thing. After I flew home that night, I looked up an old reference book. I learned that if the train had completed the run in an even four hours – a schedule that was soon to be introduced – it would have traveled at the same average speed of 81.6 km/h as the London to Bristol Express in 1851.&quot;

In April 1984, he and several CSIRO senior staff members, and a senior engineering manager from BHP, met to discuss a concept paper. On the day before Good Friday, they agreed on the components and who would write them. They all had commitments and agreed it would take six weeks to put a draft together. However, such was their private enthusiasm that each of them worked right through the four-day break, virtually finishing their drafts. In July 1984 the completed work was published as &quot;A Proposal for a Fast Railway between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne&quot;. It turned the high-speed train from a broad concept to a tangible proposal, remarkably predicting the main issues that would be involved in the development of an Australian high-speed railway.

From Sydney to Canberra much of the route was similar to that of the Hume Highway. From the national capital it proceeded south – paralleling the coast, generally about 70 kilometres inland – via Cooma and Bombala to Orbost; then west to Melbourne, very close to the coast. This route was chosen because it would provide better access for people in the coastal south-east of New South Wales and eastern Victoria, who were very poorly served by transport links. Further, it would encourage decentralisation more than a wholly inland route would, because about 80 per cent of Australians choose to live within 50 kilometres of the coast. Despite VFT curves being 20 times broader than on the existing Sydney–Melbourne railway, the proposed route was able to go around mountains rather than going through them. The direction of valleys was favourable for the most part, minimising the cost of tunnelling and substantial earthworks.

Wild&#x27;s science minister, Barry Jones, enclosed a copy in a letter to the Prime Minister, observing that the concept would be very valuable in assisting decentralisation. The proposal would be sent to the federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, with comments reflecting his officials&#x27; opinion: it was not worth considering. Although Sydney–Melbourne was later identified as the fourth-busiest air route in the world (busier than any in North America, or any in Europe apart from Madrid to Barcelona) and the bureau had no firm data on transport markets in south-eastern Australia, its officials judged passenger fares would need to be set at a rate that would not be commercially viable. The bureau would not accept the French experience that the laws of physics (in which momentum is proportional to the square of the velocity) allowed much steeper gradients (hence much fewer cut-and-fill earthworks) than on low-speed railways. The difference in the estimation of earthworks was $2 billion – a significant proportion of the total cost of the project.

On 12 September 1984, during Parliament, Morris would describe the proposal as grandiose, likening it to another proposal to build a canal through the centre of Australia. He said that he would not &quot;recommend to the Government that resources should be allocated to even do a study on it&quot;, and that &quot;if, as has been suggested by its proponents [...] the private sector is interested in it, I would say to Dr Wild that he should take the proposal back to the private sector [...] and let them put it forward and fund it.&quot;

After meeting with Morris later in September, Wild opined that &quot;in many areas Australia needed desperately to dig itself out of the stagnation of 19th century thought.&quot; He believed the reaction highlighted Australia&#x27;s general malaise; he deplored the emphasis on the short term and the preference for patching up decaying and unprofitable systems, ignoring imaginative plans for the future. He called for a much larger, objective investigation by independent experts, including those from overseas countries which already had fast trains. In doing so he emphasised that he was not seeking government funding for the scheme – merely support for a $500,000 study that would last 12 months. He would later reflect that he had got into some trouble &quot;saying that this knock-back was characteristic of the malaise which the country is suffering, which got into a headline.&quot;

However, there was to be a good outcome: soon afterwards Peter Abeles, head of transport giant TNT, telephoned him and said, &quot;I think I can help you with a commercial solution to your problem.&quot; After that, Wild said, &quot;Bit by bit, with his support, I got a joint venture together. And that&#x27;s when we did the main part of the work.&quot;

Wild retired from CSIRO in October 1985, but CSIRO continued to support pre-feasibility studies until October 1988. By September 1986 he had brought together an unincorporated joint venture of TNT, Elders IXL and Kumagai Gumi. In August 1987, after delay caused by uncertainties surrounding a potential takeover of their company, the BHP joined as the fourth, and subsequently foremost, partner. Wild became chairman of the Very Fast Train Joint Venture.

=== Further studies (1987-1988) ===
In June 1987 the joint venture&#x27;s pre-feasibility study was completed. It postulated that the project was technically feasible and financially viable. It envisaged a purpose-built high-speed line from Sydney to Canberra via Bowral and Goulburn, and either a coastal route from Canberra to Melbourne via Cooma, East Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley – or an inland route via Wagga Wagga, Albury-Wodonga, Wangaratta and Seymour. Later, routes to Brisbane and Adelaide were conceptualised.

In July–August 1988 a $1 million passenger market analysis was completed and a feasibility study was started, for which the joint venture partners budgeted $19 million. In December, a VFT Concept Report was released, identifying the key issues for a high-speed rail system, to be built and operated by private enterprise, with trains operating between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne at speeds up to . The report sought positive responses from the New South Wales, Victorian and federal governments and the Australian Capital Territory administration in facilitating access to land for survey and route investigation; ensuring cooperation by government agencies; and forms of support, including enactment of legislation to facilitate land acquisition.

The VFT project attracted widespread public and media interest. The latter was not always favorable, picking up on government scepticism about the project. Some public commentators spoke from a pre-ordained position. Although Wild had no doubts about the complexity of such an undertaking in an age of public consultation, he warned that the project would &quot;end in a shambles if every professor and greenie had their say&quot;.

Overall public support for the project was very strong. A survey of Gippsland residents found it had 70% support. A Morgan research poll found 65% support for the project throughout Victoria and New South Wales. Another poll showed support throughout metropolitan and country areas of Victoria and New South Wales at 80%.

=== Issues and eventual scrapping (1990-1991) ===
In July 1990 the VFT joint venture announced comparative studies of market demand and capital costs on the coastal and the inland routes. In October 1990, Wild announced that the inland route was the preferred choice for the VFT. The decision not to proceed with the original route to the east of the Snowy Mountains and through Gippsland was a difficult one for the VFT Joint Venture and for Wild personally. The decision was based purely on the capital costs and predicted financial performance of the two routes: there was no interest from any government in the developmental benefits which the coastal route would have brought to the south-eastern area of Australia.

The decision earned the scorn of the original corporate supporter of the proposal, Sir Peter Abeles, a visionary who from the start had been attracted to the VFT&#x27;s national development potential. Aware of the growth that fast trains overseas had generated along entire routes, he could not see the point of going inland, where few people wanted to live. His response to the decision was &quot;You&#x27;ve lost the plot&quot;.

The project faced other problems. Internally, the views of the members of the joint venture were not always in alignment. As many people in business in Australia know, a joint venture is a less robust form of business enterprise than a company. Certainly there were many strains within the VFT Joint Venture, and they increased as the feasibility study progressed. Wild, referring in 1995 to when the project expanded under the joint venture said, &quot;We then got in some professional management and I think things started to slide from then on&quot;. His role as chairman of the joint venture was not easy.

Externally, there was the continuing issue of dealing with four governments, i.e. the federal government; the state governments of New South Wales and Victoria; and following the recent granting of self-government to the national capital, the Australian Capital Territory government. They had differing agendas and a tendency to look for problems associated with the project rather than the opportunities it offered. This attitude led to the eventual insurmountable hurdle which the project faced, when the issue arose of the tax treatment which would be necessary for the project to proceed. The VFT team worked hard in 1990 and 1991 to devise an acceptable approach. Despite the economic benefits which had been identified in a third-party analysis the federal government was not prepared to move in the area of tax.

Wild retained a sense of bitterness about the federal government&#x27;s short-sightedness that thwarted the project. He said: The thing that lost the project in the end was that we were asking for some very reasonable taxation arrangements which would apply in the early days of very heavy spending – in the long run we would be paying more taxes but we just wanted to ease the taxes during that early time – and that was knocked back by the government, in fact by the treasurer ... Paul Keating, and I would say that he is the man responsible for stopping [the] project.&quot;

In August 1991 the federal government gave its final, negative answer and the joint venture ceased work on the project. Ironically, the federal government soon introduced infrastructure bonds to assist major projects facing the same financial hurdles as the VFT. However, Australian governments have continued to struggle to find acceptable mechanisms for public–private partnerships undertaking infrastructure projects.

Wild also concluded there were internal factors that in hindsight could be seen to have hampered the project: he believed the chosen corporate structure of a joint venture lacked the governance strengths and focus of a company; too many project delays had occurred; and it would have been better to buy TGVs &quot;off the shelf&quot; than to proceed, as they had, with a train that was to be designed and built in Australia.

==Latter years==
In 1991 Wild&#x27;s wife of 43 years, Elaine, died. Soon after the VFT project ended, he went for a holiday in the US and took with him the address of an old colleague in radiophysics – only to find that he had recently died. A few months later he proposed to his colleague&#x27;s widow, Margaret Lyndon, and they had 12 happy years together before she died. During this time they alternated between Ann Arbor and Canberra.

When in the US Paul Wild spent hours with Margaret&#x27;s son, Tom Haddock, also a research scientist, discussing general relativity, the origin of inertia, the clever way the Soviet scientists Landau and Lifshitz developed their arguments on field theory, and then-current experiments such as the Gravity Probe B satellite to detect the general relativistic Lense-Thirring frame-dragging effect from the Earth&#x27;s spin. The origin of inertia was a special interest Wild had, which they discussed at great length. Haddock reflected, &quot;Physics went well beyond being Paul&#x27;s profession; it was his hobby as well.&quot;

The two also worked together on a paper in gravitational theory, &#x27;Evaluation of the Cosmic Density Parameter, Omega&#x27;, concerning the component of omega due to mass. The purely theoretically derived result was based solely on an equation of general relativity, given by Einstein, relating inertial and gravitational mass – independent of the values of the gravitational constant and the Hubble constant. The paper reflected the strong, creative interest Wild had in gravitation, relativity and cosmology right to the end.

That is not surprising. In a 1995 interview Wild nominated his most significant achievement to be the building of the Culgoora radio-heliograph and providing the world with a unique eye to view and record moving pictures of rapidly changing solar activity. He observed:most scientific discoveries, had they not been made by the originator, would have been made by somebody else within a year or so or even less. To my mind the most significant discoveries or projects are those which would have eluded other researchers for decades or more. … The [Culgoora radio-heliograph] revealed a whole range of previously unknown phenomena at a wavelength millions of times longer than the wavelength of all other moving pictures ever taken of the sun. Today, nearly three decades later, the instrument has not been duplicated and the results remain unique. In saying this I do not want to give the impression that I did it all by myself. I owe much to CSIRO and the Ford Foundation for providing the resources and to a wonderful bunch of colleagues who built it and made it all work.

Paul Wild was a knowledgeable classical music lover, enjoying Beethoven in particular; an expert at &quot;The Times&quot; crossword puzzles, chess and bridge; a railway enthusiast; a social cricketer and a &quot;walking encyclopaedia of cricket knowledge&quot;. Although in his consummate professionalism he had an inherent dignity, not far from the surface there was always an innate sense of fun. His interviewer for the National Library of Australia oral history project, Ann Moyal, referred to &quot;his story, with its humorous shafts&quot;.

Wild&#x27;s humour also came through in the occasional light-hearted impersonation. It was evident from early days, such as in the Pacific, when the officers of HMS &quot;King George V&quot; entertained some American admirals and their staffs. It was, he related, 
a very considerable gathering of gold braid. The British ships, of course, were very popular because they were wet and the Americans&#x27; were dry, and so they were all having a marvellous time when the captain grabbed hold of me. I had one talent in those days, in the amusement line, and that was to give a convincing imitation of the Führer and of Winston Churchill. And the captain grabbed me and said he wanted me to address them as Hitler. And so somebody got a burnt cork and produced the moustache and a comb on the hair, and there they were assembled before me, all this mass of gold braid. And I gave them several minutes of harangue in mock-German, and eventually I finished and a great roar went up with a mass of hands going up at forty-five degrees baying &quot;Sieg, heil!, Sieg, heil!&quot; over and over again, and it&#x27;s the mass of gold braid on these arms that lives in my memory. 

Wild engendered intense loyalties among the people he knew. His formative naval service gave him a strong sense of teamwork and obligation to others, and to seeking the fairest way ahead. His CSIRO successor spoke of &quot;his generosity in sharing ideas&quot;, that he was &quot;extremely approachable&quot;, with &quot;the magical ability to reduce the most complex of concepts to simple terms understood by all&quot;; and when these concepts &quot;were realised in practice he never failed to acknowledge the role [his colleagues] played in developing them.&quot;

Paul Wild died of natural causes in Canberra on 10 May 2008.

<text>Inslaw, Inc. is a Washington, D.C.–based information technology company that markets case management software for corporate and government users. Inslaw is known for developing PROMIS, an early case management software system. It is also known for a lawsuit that it brought against the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) in 1986 over PROMIS, alleging that the Justice Department had dishonestly conspired to &quot;drive Inslaw out of business &#x27;through trickery, fraud and deceit&#x27;&quot; by withholding payments to Inslaw and then pirating the software.

Inslaw won damages in bankruptcy court, but these were overturned on appeal. The suit resulted in several Justice Department internal reviews, two Congressional investigations, the appointment of a special counsel by Attorney General William P. Barr, and a lengthy review of the special counsel&#x27;s report under Attorney General Janet Reno. Inslaw&#x27;s claims were finally referred by Congress to the Court of Federal Claims in 1995, and the dispute ended with the Court&#x27;s ruling against Inslaw in 1998. During the 12-year long legal proceedings, Inslaw accused the Department of Justice of conspiring to steal its software, attempting to drive it into Chapter 7 liquidation, using the stolen software for covert intelligence operations against foreign governments, and involvement in a murder. These accusations were eventually rejected by the special counsel and the Court of Federal Claims.

== History of Inslaw ==
Inslaw began as a non-profit organization called the Institute for Law and Social Research. The Institute was founded in 1973 by William A. Hamilton to develop case management software for law enforcement office automation. Funded by grants and contracts from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), the Institute developed a program it called &quot;PROMIS&quot;, an acronym for Prosecutors&#x27; Management Information System, for use in law enforcement record keeping and case-monitoring activities. When Congress voted to abolish the LEAA in 1980, Hamilton decided to continue operating as a for-profit corporation and market the software to current and new users. In January 1981 Hamilton established the for-profit Inslaw, transferring the Institute&#x27;s assets over to the new corporation.

== Development of PROMIS ==

PROMIS (Prosecutors Management Information System) was a case management software developed by Inslaw. The software program was developed with aid from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to aid prosecutors&#x27; offices in tracking cases. PROMIS software was originally written in COBOL for use on mainframe computers; later a version was developed to run on 16 bit mini-computers such as the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11. The primary users of this early version of the software were the United States Attorneys Office of the District of Columbia, and state and local law enforcement. Both the mainframe and 16 bit mini-computer versions of PROMIS were developed under LEAA contracts, and in later litigation, both Inslaw and DOJ eventually agreed that the early version of PROMIS was in the public domain, meaning that neither the Institute nor its successor had exclusive rights to it.

== The Promis implementation contract ==
In 1979, the DOJ contracted with the Institute to do a pilot project that installed versions of PROMIS in four US Attorneys offices; two using the mini-computer version, and the other two a &quot;word-processor&quot; version which the Institute was developing. Encouraged by the results, the Department decided in 1981 to go ahead with a full implementation of locally based PROMIS systems, and issued a request for proposals (RFP) to install the mini-computer version of PROMIS in the 20 largest United States Attorneys offices. This contract, usually called the &quot;implementation contract&quot; in later litigation, also included developing and installing &quot;word-processor&quot; versions of PROMIS at 74 smaller offices. The now for-profit Inslaw responded to the RFP, and in March 1982 was awarded the three-year $10 million contract by the contracting division, the Executive Office of United States Attorneys (EOUSA). Having previously developed a 16-bit version of PROMIS, Inslaw developed a 32-bit version, for various operating systems, specifically VAX/VMS, Unix, OS/400, and (in the 1990s) Windows NT.

===Contract disputes and Inslaw bankruptcy===
The contract did not go smoothly. Disputes between EOUSA and Inslaw began soon after its execution. A key dispute over proprietary rights had to be solved by a bi-lateral change to the original contract. (This change, &quot;Modification 12,&quot; is discussed below.) EOUSA also determined that Inslaw was in violation of the terms of an &quot;advance payment&quot; clause in the contract. This clause was important to Inslaw&#x27;s financing and became the subject of months of negotiations. There were also disputes over service fees. During the first year of the contract, the DOJ did not have the hardware to run PROMIS in any of the offices covered by the contract. As a stopgap measure, Inslaw provided PROMIS on a time-share basis through a VAX computer in Virginia, allowing the offices to access PROMIS on the Inslaw VAX through remote terminals, until the needed equipment was installed on-site. EOUSA claimed that Inslaw had overcharged for this service and withheld payments.

The DOJ ultimately acquired Prime computers, and Inslaw began installing PROMIS on these in the second year of the contract, in August 1983. The &quot;word-processor&quot; PROMIS installation, however, continued to have problems, and in February 1984 the DOJ cancelled this portion of the contract. Following this cancellation, the financial condition of Inslaw worsened, and the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 1985.

===Proprietary rights dispute===
The implementation contract called for the installation of the mini-computer version of PROMIS, plus some later modifications that had also been funded by LEAA contracts and, like the mini-computer version, were in the public domain. In addition, the contract data rights clause &quot;gave the government unlimited rights in any technical data and computer software delivered under the contract.&quot; This presented a potential conflict with Inslaw&#x27;s plans to market a commercial version of PROMIS which it called &quot;PROMIS 82&quot; or &quot;Enhanced PROMIS.&quot; The issue came up early in the implementation contract, but was resolved by an exchange of letters in which DOJ signed off on the issue after Inslaw assured the DOJ that PROMIS 82 contained &quot;enhancements undertaken by Inslaw at private expense after the cessation of LEAA funding.&quot;

The issue arose again in December 1982 when the DOJ invoked its contract rights to request all the PROMIS programs and documentation being provided under the contract. The reason the DOJ gave for this request in later litigation was that it was concerned about Inslaw&#x27;s financial condition. At that point, DOJ had access to PROMIS only through a VAX time-sharing arrangement with Inslaw; if Inslaw failed, DOJ would be left without a copy of the software and data it was entitled to under the contract. Inslaw responded in February 1983 that it was willing to provide the computer tapes and documents for PROMIS, but that the tapes it had were for the VAX version of PROMIS, and included proprietary enhancements. Before providing the tapes, Inslaw wrote, &quot;Inslaw and the Department of Justice will have to reach an agreement on the inclusion or exclusion&quot; of the features.

The DOJ response to Inslaw was to emphasize that the implementation contract called for a version of PROMIS in which the government had unlimited rights and to ask for information about the enhancements Inslaw claimed as proprietary. Inslaw agreed to provide this information, but noted that it would be difficult to remove the enhancements from the time-sharing version of PROMIS and offered to provide the VAX version of PROMIS if the DOJ would agree to limit their distribution. In March 1983, the DOJ again informed Inslaw that the implementation contract required Inslaw to produce software in which the government had unlimited rights, and that delivery of software with restrictions would not satisfy the contract.

===Contract revisions===
After some back and forth, DOJ contracting officer Peter Videnieks sent a letter proposing a contract modification. Under the modification, in return for the software and data request, DOJ agreed not to disclose or disseminate the material &quot;beyond the Executive Office for United States Attorney and the 94 United States Attorneys&#x27; Offices covered by the subject contract, until the data rights of the parties to the contract are resolved.&quot; To resolve the data rights issue, the letter proposed that Inslaw identify its claimed proprietary enhancements and demonstrate that the enhancements were developed &quot;at private expense and outside the scope of any government contract.&quot; After these were identified, the government would then &quot;either direct Inslaw to delete those enhancements from the versions of PROMIS to be delivered under the contract or negotiate with Inslaw regarding the inclusion of those enhancements in that software.&quot; Inslaw eventually agreed to this suggestion, and the change, referred to as &quot;Modification 12,&quot; was executed in April 1983. Inslaw then provided DOJ with tapes and documentation for the VAX version of PROMIS.

Under this arrangement, however, Inslaw had substantial difficulty demonstrating the extent of the enhancements and the use of private funding in their development. It proposed several methods for doing this, but these were rejected by DOJ as inadequate. Inslaw&#x27;s attempts to identify the proprietary enhancements and their funding ended when it began installing PROMIS on the USAO Prime computers in August 1983. By the end of the contract in March 1983, it had completed installing PROMIS in all 20 of the offices specified in the implementation contract. Since none of the available versions of PROMIS was compatible with the Department&#x27;s new Prime computers, Inslaw ported the VAX version, which contained Inslaw&#x27;s claimed enhancements, to the Prime computers.

==Inslaw&#x27;s bankruptcy case==
After Inslaw filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 1985, there were still disputes over implementation contract payments, and as a result the DOJ was listed as one of Inslaw&#x27;s creditors. At the same time, the DOJ continued its office automation program and, in place of the originally planned &quot;word-processor&quot; version of PROMIS, it installed the version ported to Prime mini-computers in at least 23 more offices. When Inslaw learned of the installations, it notified EOUSA that this was in violation of Modification 12 and filed a claim for $2.9 million, which Inslaw said was the license fees for the software DOJ self-installed. Inslaw also filed claims for services performed during the contract, for a total of $4.1 million. The DOJ contracting officer, Peter Videnieks, denied all these claims.

Inslaw appealed the denial of the service fees to the Department of Transportation Board of Contract Appeals (DOTBCA). For the data rights claim, however, Inslaw took a different approach. In June 1986 it filed an adversary hearing in the Bankruptcy Court, claiming that DOJ&#x27;s actions violated the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code by interfering with the company&#x27;s rights to its software.

Inslaw&#x27;s initial filing claimed that the contract disputes arose because the DOJ officials who administered the contract were biased against Inslaw. The filing specifically mentioned PROMIS project manager, C. Madison Brewer, and Associate Attorney General, D. Lowell Jensen. Brewer had previously been Inslaw&#x27;s general counsel, but according to Inslaw had been terminated for cause. Inslaw claimed that Brewer&#x27;s dismissal caused him to be unreasonably biased against Inslaw and owner William Hamilton. Jensen was a member of the project oversight committee at the time of the contract. He had helped to develop another competing case management software system several years earlier, and Inslaw claimed that this led him to be prejudiced against PROMIS, so that he ignored the unreasonable bias of Brewer.

===&quot;Independent handling&quot; proceeding===
In February 1987, Inslaw requested an &quot;independent handling hearing&quot;, to force the DOJ to conduct the adversary hearing &quot;independent of any Department of Justice officials involved in the allegations made&quot; in the hearing. The bankruptcy court judge assigned to handle Inslaw&#x27;s Chapter 11 proceedings, Judge George F. Bason, granted the request, and scheduled the hearing for June.

Prior to the hearing, Inslaw owners William and Nancy Hamilton spoke to Anthony Pasciuto, then the Deputy Director of the Executive Office of the United States Trustees (EOUST), a DOJ component responsible for overseeing the administration of bankruptcy cases. Pasciuto told the Hamiltons that the Director of the EOUST, Thomas Stanton, had pressured the U.S. Trustee assigned to the Inslaw case, Edward White, to convert Inslaw&#x27;s bankruptcy from chapter 11 (reorganization of the company), to chapter 7 (liquidation). The Hamiltons had Inslaw&#x27;s attorneys depose the people whom Pasciuto had named. One of them corroborated part of Pasciuto&#x27;s claims: Cornelius Blackshear, then a U. S. Trustee in New York, swore in his deposition testimony that he was aware of pressure to convert the bankruptcy. Two days later, however, Blackshear submitted an affidavit recanting his testimony, saying that he had mistakenly recalled an instance of pressure from another case.

Blackshear repeated his retraction at the June hearing on Inslaw&#x27;s request. Pasciuto also retracted part of his claims at this hearing, and said instead that he did not use the word &quot;conversion.&quot; Judge Bason, however, chose to believe the original depositions of Pasciuto and Blackshear, and found that the DOJ &quot;unlawfully, intentionally and willfully&quot; tried to convert INSLAW&#x27;s Chapter 11 reorganization case to a Chapter 7 liquidation &quot;without justification and by improper means.&quot; In the ruling, Bason was harshly critical of the testimony of several DOJ officials, describing it as &quot;evasive and unbelievable,&quot; or &quot;simply on its face unbelievable.&quot; He enjoined the DOJ and the EOUST from contacting anyone in the U.S. Trustee&#x27;s office handling the Inslaw case except for information requests.

===Adversary proceeding===
Inslaw&#x27;s adversary proceeding followed a month after the independent handling hearing. The proceeding lasted for two and half weeks, from late July to August. In a bench ruling on September 28, Judge Bason found that DOJ project manager Brewer, &quot;believing he had been wrongfully discharged by Mr. Hamilton and INSLAW, developed an intense and abiding hatred for Mr. Hamilton and INSLAW,&quot; and had used his position at DOJ to &quot;vent his spleen.&quot; He also found that the DOJ &quot;took, converted, stole, INSLAW&#x27;s enhanced PROMIS by trickery, fraud, and deceit.&quot; Specifically, he found that DOJ had used the threat of terminating &quot;advance payments&quot; to get a copy of the enhanced PROMIS that it was not entitled to, and that it had negotiated modification 12 of the contract in bad faith, never intending to meet its commitment under the modification. In his ruling, Judge Bason again called the testimony of DOJ witnesses &quot;biased&quot;, &quot;unbelievable&quot;, and &quot;unreliable.&quot;

===Judge Bason not reappointed===
Judge Bason was appointed to the District of Columbia Bankruptcy Court in February 1984 for a four-year term. He sought re-appointment early in 1987, but was informed in December that the Court of Appeals had chosen another candidate. Judge Bason then suggested in a letter to the Court of Appeals that DOJ might have improperly influenced the selection process because of his bench ruling for Inslaw. After learning of this letter, DOJ lawyers moved to recuse Judge Bason from the Inslaw case, but their motion was rejected, and Judge Bason remained on the case until the expiration of his term on February 8, 1988. In early February, Judge Bason filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent the judge the Court of Appeals had selected for the District of Columbia Bankruptcy Court from taking office, but the suit was rejected. Bason&#x27;s last actions in the case were to file a written ruling on Inslaw&#x27;s adversary proceeding, and to award damages and attorneys fees to Inslaw.

===Appeals of the bankruptcy suit===
After Judge Bason left the bench, the Inslaw bankruptcy was assigned to Baltimore bankruptcy judge James Schneider. Schneider accepted Inslaw&#x27;s reorganization plan at the end of 1988 after a cash infusion from IBM. In the meantime, DOJ filed an appeal of Judge Bason&#x27;s adversary suit ruling in the District of Columbia Circuit Court. In November 1989, Circuit Court Judge William Bryant upheld Bason&#x27;s ruling. Reviewing the case under the &quot;clear error&quot; standard for reversal, Bryant wrote: &quot;[T]here is convincing, perhaps compelling support for the findings set forth by the bankruptcy court.&quot;

DOJ appealed the Circuit Court decision and in May 1991, the Court of Appeals found the DOJ had not violated the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and that the Bankruptcy Court therefore lacked jurisdiction over Inslaw&#x27;s claims against DOJ. It vacated the Bankruptcy Court&#x27;s rulings and dismissed Inslaw&#x27;s complaint. Inslaw appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case.

==Federal investigations==
Inslaw&#x27;s allegations against the Justice Department led to a number of investigations, including internal Department probes and Congressional investigations by the Senate&#x27;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) and the House Judiciary Committee. The DOJ eventually appointed a special counsel to investigate. After the special counsel issued his report, Inslaw responded with a lengthy rebuttal. The DOJ then re-examined the special counsel&#x27;s findings, resulting in the release of a final Department review. During these federal investigations, Inslaw began making allegations of a broad, complex conspiracy to steal PROMIS, involving many more people and many more claims than the bankruptcy proceedings had covered. These later allegations are described below under the investigations which examined them.

===Justice Department investigations===
After Judge Bason&#x27;s June 1987 bench ruling found several DOJ officials&#x27; testimony &quot;unbelievable&quot;, DOJ&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) opened an investigation of DOJ staff who testified at the hearing, including C. Madison Brewer, Peter Videnieks, and EOUST director Thomas Stanton. It also opened a separate investigation of EOUST deputy director Anthony Pasciuto. OPR recommended Pasciuto be terminated, based on his hearing testimony that he had made false statements to the Hamiltons, but in its final report it found no evidence that the other officials investigated had applied pressure to convert Inslaw&#x27;s bankruptcy or lied during the independent handling hearing. After Judge Bason issued his written ruling in January 1988, Inslaw&#x27;s attorneys also complained to the DOJ&#x27;s Public Integrity Section that Judge Blackshear and U.S. Trustee Edward White had committed perjury. Public Integrity opened an investigation that ultimately found perjury cases could not be proven, and recommended declining prosecution.

===The Senate report===
The first Congressional investigation into the Inslaw case came from the Senate&#x27;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI). PSI&#x27;s report was issued in September 1989, after a year and a half of investigation. During the investigation, Inslaw made a number of new allegations, which take up most of the PSI report.

====New allegations====
Inslaw&#x27;s new allegations described the Justice Department dispute with Inslaw as part of a broad conspiracy to drive Inslaw into bankruptcy so that Earl Brian, the founder of a venture capital firm called Biotech (later Infotechnology), could acquire Inslaw&#x27;s assets, including its software PROMIS. Inslaw owner William Hamilton told PSI investigators that Brian had first attempted to acquire Inslaw through a computer services corporation he controlled, called Hadron. Hamilton said that he rejected an offer from Hadron to acquire Inslaw, and that Brian then attempted to drive Inslaw into bankruptcy through his influence with Attorney General Edwin Meese.

Both Meese and Brian had served in the cabinet of Ronald Reagan when he was governor of California, and Meese&#x27;s wife had later bought stock in Brian&#x27;s company, so that Meese was willing to do this, Hamilton claimed. The contract dispute with DOJ was contrived by Brian and Meese with the help of Associate Attorney General Jensen, and PROMIS project manager Brewer.

Hamilton also complained that a DOJ automation program, &#x27;Project Eagle&#x27;, was part of a scheme to benefit Brian after he acquired PROMIS, and that an AT&amp;T subsidiary, AT&amp;T Information Systems, had engaged with the DOJ in a conspiracy to interfere with Inslaw&#x27;s efforts to reorganize. He also told PSI investigators that the DOJ had undermined Bankruptcy Court Judge Bason&#x27;s reappointment, and had attempted to undermine Inslaw&#x27;s lead counsel in the bankruptcy suit.

====Report findings====
Senate investigators found no proof for any of these claims. Their report noted that the bankruptcy court ruling had not concluded that Jensen had engaged in a conspiracy against Inslaw and that their own investigation had found no proof that Jensen and Meese had conspired to ruin Inslaw or steal its product, or that Brian or Hadron were involved in a conspiracy to undermine Inslaw and acquire its assets.

The report did re-examine the bankruptcy finding that the DOJ had pressured the United States Trustee to recommend converting Inslaw&#x27;s bankruptcy from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, and found that EOUST director Thomas Stanton had improperly tried to get special handling for Inslaw&#x27;s bankruptcy. He did this, the report stated, in order to gain support for the EOUST from the DOJ.

The report concluded that the Subcommittee found no proof for a broad conspiracy against Inslaw within the DOJ, or a conspiracy between DOJ officials and outside parties to force Inslaw into bankruptcy for personal benefit. However, it criticized DOJ for hiring a former Inslaw employee (Brewer) to oversee Inslaw&#x27;s contract with EOUSA, and for failing to follow standard procedures in handling Inslaw&#x27;s complaints. It also criticized the DOJ for a lack of cooperation with the Subcommittee, which delayed the investigation and undercut the Subcommittee&#x27;s ability to interview Department employees.

===The House report===
Following the PSI report, the House Judiciary Committee began another investigation into the dispute. By the time the report was released in September 1992, Inslaw&#x27;s bankruptcy suit had been first upheld in the D.C. Circuit Court, then vacated by the D.C. Appeals court. The House report thus took a different approach to several of the legal issues that the Senate report had discussed. Like the Senate report, much of the House report dealt with new evidence and new allegations from Inslaw.

The report raised &quot;serious concerns&quot; that Justice Department officials had schemed &quot;to destroy Inslaw and co-opt the rights to its PROMIS software&quot; and had misappropriated the software. The report was the outgrowth of a three-year investigation led by Jack Brooks, the committee&#x27;s chairman, who had launched in investigation in 1989. The report faulted the Justice Department for a lack of cooperation in the investigation and found that &quot;There appears to be strong evidence, as indicated by the findings in two Federal Court proceedings as well as by the committee investigation, that the Department of Justice &#x27;acted willfully and fraudulently,&#x27; and &#x27;took, converted and stole,&#x27; Inslaw&#x27;s Enhanced PROMIS by &#x27;trickery fraud and deceit.&#x27;&quot;

====New allegations====
Inslaw&#x27;s new evidence consisted of statements and affidavits from witnesses supporting Inslaw&#x27;s previous claims. The most important of these witnesses was Michael Riconosciuto, who swore in an affidavit for Inslaw that businessman Earl Brian had provided him with a copy of Inslaw&#x27;s enhanced Promis, supporting Inslaw&#x27;s earlier claims that Brian had been interested in acquiring and marketing the software. A new allegation was also introduced in Riconosciuto&#x27;s affidavit: Riconosciuto swore that he added modifications to enhanced PROMIS &quot;to support a plan for the implementation of PROMIS in law enforcement and intelligence agencies worldwide.&quot; According to Riconosciuto, &quot;Earl W. Brian was spearheading the plan for this worldwide use of the PROMIS computer software.&quot;

Another important witness was Ari Ben-Menashe, who also provided affidavits for Inslaw that Brian had brought both public domain and enhanced versions of PROMIS to Israel, and eventually sold the enhanced version to the Israeli government. Committee investigators interviewed Ben-Menashe in May 1991, and he told them that Brian sold enhanced PROMIS to both Israeli intelligence and Singapore&#x27;s armed forces, receiving several million dollars in payment. He also testified that Brian sold public domain versions to Iraq and Jordan.

====Report findings====
On the issue of Inslaw&#x27;s rights in &quot;enhanced PROMIS&quot;, the House report found that &quot;There appears to be strong evidence&quot; supporting Judge Bason&#x27;s finding that DOJ &quot;acted willfully and fraudulently&quot; when it &quot;took, converted and stole&quot; INSLAW&#x27;s Enhanced PROMIS by &quot;trickery, fraud and deceit.&quot; Like Judge Bason, the report found that DOJ did not negotiate with Inslaw in good faith, citing a statement by Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns as &quot;one of the most damaging statements received by the committee.&quot; According to the report, Burns told OPR investigators that Department attorneys informed him in 1986 that INSLAW&#x27;s claim of proprietary rights was legitimate and that DOJ would probably lose in court on this issue. House Investigator found it &quot;incredible&quot; that DOJ would pursue litigation after such a determination, and concluded &quot;This clearly raises the specter that the Department actions taken against INSLAW in this matter represent an abuse of power of shameful proportions.&quot; 

On the new allegations brought by Inslaw, although the Committee conducted extensive investigations, the report did not make any factual findings on the allegations, it did conclude that further investigation was warranted into the statements and claims of Inslaw&#x27;s witnesses. The report also discussed the case of Danny Casolaro, a free-lance writer who became interested in the Inslaw case in 1990, and began his own investigation. According to statements from Casolaro&#x27;s friends and family, the scope of his investigation eventually expanded to include a number of scandals of the time, including the Iran-Contra affair, the October Surprise theory claims, and the BCCI banking scandal. In August 1991, Casolaro was found dead in a hotel room where he was staying. The initial coroner&#x27;s report ruled his death suicide, but Casolaro&#x27;s family and friends were suspicious, and a lengthy second autopsy was conducted. This also ruled Casolaro&#x27;s death a suicide. Noting that Casolaro had encountered &quot;a number of dangerous individuals associated with organized crime and the world of covert intelligence operations&quot; and that &quot;suspicious circumstances surrounding his death have led some law enforcement professionals and others to believe that his death may not have been a suicide&quot;, the House committee reported that further investigation was warranted. The Democratic majority called upon Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to compensate Inslaw immediately for the harm that the government had &quot;egregiously&quot; inflicted on Inslaw. The Republican minority dissented and the committee divided along party lines 21–13.

===Bua report===
In October 1991 William P. Barr succeeded Dick Thornburgh as Attorney General. In November, Barr appointed retired federal judge Nicholas J. Bua as a Special Counsel to investigate the allegations in the Inslaw case. Bua was granted authority to appoint his own staff and investigators, to impanel a grand jury, and to issue subpoenas. In March 1993 he issued a 267-page report.

The report concluded that there was no credible evidence to support Inslaw&#x27;s allegations that DOJ officials conspired to help Earl Brian acquire PROMIS software, and that the evidence was overwhelming that there was no connection between Brian and PROMIS. It found the evidence &quot;woefully insufficient&quot; to support the claim that DOJ obtained enhanced PROMIS through &quot;fraud, trickery, and deceit,&quot; or that DOJ illegally distributed PROMIS inside or outside of DOJ. It found no credible evidence that DOJ had influenced the selection process that replaced Judge Bason. It found &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; to confirm the allegation that DOJ employees sought to influence the conversion of Inslaw&#x27;s bankruptcy or commit perjury to conceal the attempt to do so. Finally, it concluded that the DOJ had not sought to influence the investigation of Danny Casolaro&#x27;s death, and that the physical evidence strongly supported the autopsy finding of suicide.

Bua&#x27;s report came to a number of conclusions that contradicted earlier proceedings and investigations. Judge Bason had found that DOJ&#x27;s claim it was concerned about Inslaw&#x27;s financial condition when it requested a copy of PROMIS was a false pretext. Bua rejected this finding as &quot;just plain wrong.&quot; The House report had cited Deputy Attorney General Burns&#x27; statements as evidence that DOJ knew it did not have a valid defense to Inslaw&#x27;s claims. Bua found this interpretation &quot;entirely unwarranted.&quot;

Bua was particularly critical of several of Inslaw&#x27;s witnesses. He found that Michael Riconosciuto had given inconsistent accounts in statements to the Hamiltons, his affidavit, and in testimony at his 1992 trial for manufacturing methamphetamine. Bua compared Riconosciuto&#x27;s story about PROMIS to &quot;a historical novel; a tale of total fiction woven against the background of accurate historical facts.&quot;

Bua found Ari Ben-Menashe&#x27;s affidavits for Inslaw inconsistent with his later statements to Bua, in which Ben-Menashe said that he had &quot;no knowledge of the transfer of Inslaw&#x27;s proprietary software by Earl Brian or DOJ&quot; and denied that he had ever said this elsewhere. Ben-Menashe said that others simply assumed that he was referring in his previous statements to Inslaw&#x27;s PROMIS, but acknowledged that one reason he failed to clarify this was because he was going to publish a book and &quot;he wanted to make sure that his affidavit was filed in court and came to the attention of the public.&quot;

Bua also noted that the House October Surprise Task Force had examined Ben-Menashe&#x27;s October Surprise allegations and found them &quot;totally lacking in credibility,&quot; &quot;demonstrably false from beginning to end,&quot; &quot;riddled with inconsistencies and factual misstatements,&quot; and &quot;a total fabrication.&quot; He specifically observed that the Task Force found no evidence to substantiate Ben-Menashe&#x27;s October Surprise allegations about Earl Brian.

===DOJ review===
Inslaw responded to the Bua report with a 130-page &quot;Rebuttal&quot;, and another set of new allegations in an Addendum. These allegations included the claim that the DOJ&#x27;s Office of Special Investigations was &quot;a front for the Justice Department&#x27;s own covert intelligence service&quot; and that &quot;another undeclared mission of the Justice Department&#x27;s covert agents was to insure that investigative journalist Danny Casolaro remained silent about the role of the Justice Department in the INSLAW scandal by murdering him in west Virginia in August 1991.&quot;

By this time, Janet Reno had succeeded Barr as Attorney General after Bill Clinton&#x27;s election as president. Reno then asked for a review of Bua&#x27;s report with recommendations on appropriate actions. In September 1994, the Department released a 187-page review (written by Assistant Associate Attorney General John C. Dwyer) which concluded that &quot;there is no credible evidence that Department officials conspired to steal computer software developed by Inslaw, Inc. or that the company is entitled to additional government payments.&quot; The review also reaffirmed the earlier police findings that Casolaro&#x27;s death was a suicide and rejected Inslaw&#x27;s claim that OSI agents had murdered Casolaro as &quot;fantasy,&quot; with &quot;no corroborative evidence that is even marginally credible.&quot;

==Court of Federal Claims trial and ruling==
In May 1995, the United States Senate asked the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to determine if the United States owed Inslaw compensation for the government&#x27;s use of PROMIS. On July 31, 1997, Judge Christine Miller, the hearing officer for the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that all of the versions of PROMIS were in the public domain and that the government had therefore always been free to do whatever it wished with PROMIS. The following year, the appellate authority, a three-judge Review Panel of the same court, upheld Miller&#x27;s ruling and in August 1998 informed the Senate of its findings.

==Conspiracy theories==
The Inslaw affair generated a great deal of media attention at the time due to the peculiar circumstances and implications surrounding it. At the time of his death, Danny Casolaro was attempting to link the Inslaw affair with the October Surprise allegations, the Iran–Contra affair, and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal into a &quot;grand unified conspiracy&quot; that he called &quot;the Octopus&quot;. In 2024, Netflix true crime documentary series &quot;American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders&quot; was released about the 1991 death of Danny Casolaro. It focuses on journalist Christian Hansen who revisits Casolaro&#x27;s work and questions whether Casolaro actually died by suicide. 

The program features interviews with Michael Riconosciuto, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a &quot;tech prodigy-turned-drug manufacturer and government operative who drops kernels of truth between what sound like madman ravings&quot;. Also interviewed is journalist Cheri Seymour, who reported being shown a doctored version of the Zapruder film in which John F. Kennedy appears to be assassinated by the Secret Service agent driving the car; Seymour interpreted this as an attempt to preemptively discredit her.

Affidavits created over the course of the Inslaw affair stated that &quot;PROMIS was then given or sold at a profit to Israel and as many as 80 other countries by Dr. Earl W. Brian, a man with close personal and business ties to then-President Ronald Reagan and then-Presidential counsel Edwin Meese.&quot; Investigative journalist Nathan Baca&#x27;s Emmy-winning series &quot;The Octopus Murders&quot; featured documents from the archives of Riconosciuto. These documents have been the subject of interest for recently reopened cold case homicide investigations. In addition to Casolaro&#x27;s death, the deaths of various individuals with links to the Inslaw affair have been tied to the Clinton body count conspiracy theory.

==Later developments==
A book written in 1997 by Fabrizio Calvi and Thierry Pfister claimed that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been &quot;seeding computers abroad with PROMIS-embedded SMART (Systems Management Automated Reasoning Tools) chips, code-named Petrie, capable of covertly downloading data and transmitting it, using electrical wiring as an antenna, to U.S. intelligence satellites&quot; as part of an espionage operation. A 1999 book by the British journalist Gordon Thomas, titled &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad&quot;, repeated the claims of Ari Ben-Menashe that Israeli intelligence created and marketed a Trojan horse version of PROMIS in order to spy on intelligence agencies in other countries. In 2001, the &quot;Washington Times&quot; and &quot;Fox News&quot; each quoted federal law enforcement officials familiar with debriefing former FBI Agent Robert Hanssen as claiming that the convicted spy had stolen copies of a PROMIS derivative for his Soviet KGB handlers.

<doc id="610484" wikidata="Q5633474" url="?curid=610484" title="HMS Naiad (F39)">
<text>HMS &quot;Naiad&quot; (F39) was a &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Navy (RN). Like the rest of the class, &quot;Naiad&quot; was named after a figure or figure of mythology, in this case, the Naiads of Greek mythology. &quot;Naiad&quot; was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders of Scotstoun. She was launched on 4 November 1963 and commissioned on 15 March 1965.

==Operational service==
In 1966, &quot;Naiad&quot; became the leader of the Northern Ireland Squadron and subsequently deployed to the Far East and South America. In June 1966 she was present at Kieler Woche (Kiel Week, in West Germany) and the Duke of Edinburgh held a state dinner on board in honour of West German President Heinrich Lubke. On 4 May 1967, she recommissioned for a general service commission and was present at Portsmouth Navy Days in that year.

In 1970 &quot;Naiad&quot; deployed to the Far East, and while there, participated in the Beira Patrol, designed to prevent oil reaching the landlocked Rhodesia via the then Portuguese colony of Mozambique. She performed her second patrol the following year. The Beira Patrol was a regular deployment for the RN until 1975. In 1971 she was present at Portsmouth Navy Days.

===Ikara conversion===
In January 1973 &quot;Naiad&quot; began her modernisation at Devonport Dockyard, with her twin 4.5-in gun being replaced by the Australian-designed Ikara anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missile system. The modernisation was completed in 1975, and &quot;Naiad&quot; then became part of the 6th Frigate Squadron.

===Third Cod War===

The following year &quot;Naiad&quot; undertook a Fishery Protection Patrol during the Third Cod War, and on 24 April 1976, she was rammed by the Icelandic gunboat &quot;Tyr&quot; causing hull and bow damage. The frigate began to take tons of water, which prompted damage control teams to build a concrete enclosure around the gash. &quot;Naiad&quot; required dry docking at Devonport on her return home.

In 1977, &quot;Naiad&quot;, like many other &quot;Leanders&quot;, took part in the Fleet Review, of the Royal Navy at Spithead in celebration of the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. &quot;Naiad&quot; was positioned between &quot;Brighton&quot; and her sister-ship &quot;Andromeda&quot;. In 1980 &quot;Naiad&quot; deployed to the Far East once again.

In 1981 &quot;Naiad&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean. From 1983 to 1984 she underwent a refit at Devonport Dockyard. In 1985 &quot;Naiad&quot; returned to the Mediterranean as part of the NATO multi-national squadron Naval On-call Force of the Mediterranean (NAVOCFORMED), the predecessor of the Standing Naval Force Mediterranean (STANAVFORMED). The following year &quot;Naiad&quot; joined the Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), another NATO multi-national squadron.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In April 1987 &quot;Naiad&quot; was decommissioned.

In 1989 she was used for hull trials with the name Hulvul. On 24 September 1990, &quot;Naiad&quot; was towed from Portsmouth and sunk as a target.

<doc id="610488" wikidata="Q792890" url="?curid=610488" title="Orange-breasted green pigeon">
<text>The orange-breasted green pigeon (Treron bicinctus) is a pigeon found across tropical Asia south of the Himalaya across parts of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Like other green pigeons, it feeds mainly on small fruit. They may be found in pairs or in small flocks, foraging quietly and moving slowly on trees. The nape is blue-grey and the crown is yellowish green. The uppertail coverts are bronzed and the undertail coverts are unmarked rufous. The male has a pinkish band on the upper breast with a broader orange one below while the female has a bright yellow breast.

==Identification==

Similar in appearance to other green pigeons including the yellow-footed green pigeon and the grey-fronted green pigeon but has no maroon on the wing. The male does not have any grey on the head but has a narrow band of lilac on the upper breast with a broader orange band below. The undertail-coverts are cinnamon with the longer feathers edged yellow. The tail is grey above with a broad subterminal dark band. The females are yellow below and lack the orange or lilac bands. The undertail coverts are duller cinnamon with greenish spots. The upper tail however has the central feathers slaty grey rather than green as in females of &quot;T. affinis&quot; or &quot;T. pompadora&quot;. The Sri Lankan population (&quot;T. b. leggei&quot;) is slightly smaller in wing length but otherwise similar. Other populations that have been named as subspecies include &quot;domvilii&quot; (Swinhoe, 1870) of Hainan Island and &quot;javanus&quot; Robinson &amp; Kloss, 1923 from Java and Bali. Population &quot;praetermissa&quot; from Thailand is often included in the nominate form.

==Habitat and distribution==

This is a species of forest and is widely distributed from the Terai and lower Himalayas (below ) south mainly in the Western and Eastern Ghats and in Sri Lankan forests not far from the coast. They are found in Burma, Thailand the Malay Peninsula, Vietnam, Java and Hainan. Some seasonal movements are suspected as vagrants have been recorded from locations like Sind.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Orange-breasted green pigeons usually occur singly or in small groups. Its flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. They eat seeds and fruits of a wide variety of plants often joining other frugivores at fruiting figs, foraging by slowly walking along branches. They are known to feed on &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot;, the fruits of which are toxic to mammals. They are sometimes seen on the ground. Their call is a low subdued series of modulated wandering whistles. Males fight with each other during the breeding season, slapping each other with their wing and pecking each other. The breeding season in India is March to September but mainly before June. In Sri Lanka, they breed mainly from December to May. The nest is the typical flimsy platform of a few twigs in which two white eggs are laid. Both sexes incubate and eggs hatch in about 12 to 14 days.

<text>Berwick is an unincorporated community in Polk County, Iowa, United States, on the east bank of Fourmile Creek. It is part of the Des Moines–West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Berwick&#x27;s population in 1902 was 72, and was 80 in 1925.

In the early 20th century, Berwick and Norwoodville, a mile southwest, were home to several coal mines. The Norwood-White shaft No. 1 (also known as the Klondike No. 1) was deep, accessing a coal seam. By 1908, this mine extended over roughly . Norwood-White shaft No. 2 was half a mile to the east. This mine was newer, covering over in 1908. The Delaware Coal Company had a shaft a mile northwest of Berwick, with a shaft deep. By 1908, this mine covered less than . In 1914, Norwood-White produced over 100,000 tons of coal, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state. In 1912, United Mine Workers Local 318 in Berwick had 220 members, and Local 845 in Norwoodville, one mile south, had 129 members.

<text>The observed X-ray background is thought to result from, at the &quot;soft&quot; end (below 0.3 keV), galactic X-ray emission, the &quot;galactic&quot; X-ray background, and, at the &quot;hard&quot; end (above 0.3keV), from a combination of many unresolved X-ray sources outside of the Milky Way, the &quot;cosmic&quot; X-ray background (CXB). 

The galactic X-ray background is produced largely by emission from hot gas in the Local Bubble within 100 parsecs of the Sun. 

Deep surveys with X-ray telescopes, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, have demonstrated that around 80% of the cosmic X-ray background is due to resolved extra-galactic X-ray sources, the bulk of which are unobscured (&quot;type-1&quot;) and obscured (&quot;type-2&quot;) active galactic nuclei (AGN).

<doc id="610504" wikidata="Q1928195" url="?curid=610504" title="Michael Kidd">
<text>Michael Kidd (August 12, 1915 – December 23, 2007) was an American film and stage choreographer, dancer and actor, whose career spanned five decades, and who staged some of the leading Broadway and film musicals of the 1940s and 1950s. Kidd, strongly influenced by Charlie Chaplin and Léonide Massine, was an innovator in what came to be known as the &quot;integrated musical&quot;, in which dance movements are integral to the plot.

He was probably best known for his athletic dance numbers in &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, a 1954 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical. Film critic Stephanie Zacharek called the barn-raising sequence in &quot;Seven Brides&quot; &quot;one of the most rousing dance numbers ever put on screen&quot;. He was the first choreographer to win five Tony Awards, and was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1996 for advancing dance in film.

==Early life and dance career==
Kidd was born Milton Greenwald, in New York City on the Lower East Side, the son of Abraham Greenwald, a barber, and his wife Lillian, who were Jewish refugees from Czarist Russia. He moved to Brooklyn with his family and attended New Utrecht High School. He became interested in dance after attending a modern dance performance, and went on to study under Blanche Evan, a dancer and choreographer.

He studied chemical engineering at the City College of New York in 1936 and 1937, but left after being granted a scholarship to the School of American Ballet. He toured the country as a member of the corps de ballet of Lincoln Kirstein’s Ballet Caravan, and performed in roles that included the lead in &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;, choreographed by Eugene Loring, which featured an orchestral composition by Aaron Copland.

In 1942, while performing with Ballet Caravan, Milton and his fellow dancers were encouraged to adopt an &quot;American&quot; name. His choice of the stage name &#x27;Kidd&#x27; as his older brother was a booking agent for the Concord Hotel in the Catskill Mountains, and Milton was always known as &quot;the kid.&quot;

In 1941, Kidd became a soloist and assistant to Loring in his Dance Players. He became a soloist for Ballet Theater, later known as the American Ballet Theatre. His performances there included &quot;Fancy Free&quot; (1944) choreographed by Jerome Robbins and with music by Leonard Bernstein, in which he played one of the three sailors. While at the ABT, he created his own ballet, &quot;On Stage!&quot; (1945). Although the play and his performance were well received, and the&quot; New York Times&quot; observed that Kidd was &quot;hailed as one of the great hopes of postwar American ballet,&quot; he left Loring&#x27;s company for Broadway in 1947 and never again worked in ballet.

==Broadway and Hollywood==
Kidd&#x27;s first choreography on Broadway was for E.Y. Harburg&#x27;s &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, a lyrical musical that explored racial prejudice. Kidd won his first Tony Award for that play. However, his next Broadway musicals were not successful. They were &quot;Hold It&quot;, a college musical, and the Kurt Weill/Alan Jay Lerner musical &quot;Love Life&quot;, directed by Elia Kazan, which both had short runs in 1948. Next came &quot;Arms and the Girl&quot; (1950), directed by Rouben Mamoulian, with Pearl Bailey and Nanette Fabray, also a flop.

Frank Loesser’s &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1950), his next play, cemented his reputation as a Broadway choreographer. It was based on Damon Runyon short stories, with book by Abe Burrows, and earned Kidd his second Tony Award. The play attracted the attention of movie producers, and he was lured to Hollywood.
His first film was a 1952 film adaptation of Frank Loesser&#x27;s 1948 Broadway musical &quot;Where&#x27;s Charley?&quot;, starring Ray Bolger repeating his Broadway performance in the lead role. His first big film success came the following year with &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse.

The &quot;Band Wagon&quot;, which featured the music and lyrics of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, included an extensive dance sequence at the end, the &quot;Girl Hunt Ballet&quot; featuring Astaire and Charisse, which was a spoof of hard-boiled Mickey Spillane novels. Kidd was hired to stage the film&#x27;s dances at Astaire&#x27;s request because he was nervous about the ballet. Kidd said that he made Astaire comfortable by pretending that he was just making up the steps spontaneously. The film also featured &quot;Shine on Your Shoes&quot;, set in a 42nd Street penny arcade and featuring Astaire and LeRoy Daniels, a real-life shoe-shiner, and &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; with Charisse, set in Central Park.

Kidd&#x27;s work for the 1954 film &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; brought him acclaim. The film was directed by Stanley Donen, with music by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. It was written directly for the screen and based on the short story &quot;The Sobbin&#x27; Women&quot;, by Stephen Vincent Benét, which was based in turn on the ancient Roman legend of The Rape of the Sabine Women. He initially turned down the assignment, recalling in 1997: &quot;Here are these slobs living off in the woods. They have no schooling, they are uncouth, there&#x27;s manure on the floor, the cows come in and out—and they&#x27;re gonna get up and dance? We&#x27;d be laughed out of the house.&quot;

The entire cast, even extras, consisted of a melange of dancers, acrobats and stuntmen, including the ballet dancers Jacques D&#x27;Amboise of the New York City Ballet and Marc Platt, formerly of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Except for Howard Keel and Jane Powell, the roles of the brothers and their brides were all played by professional dancers at Kidd&#x27;s insistence. Mercer said that the musical numbers were written at Kidd&#x27;s behest, as an example &quot;of how a songwriter sometimes has to take his cue from his collaborators&quot;. For example, Kidd explained to Mercer and dePaul his conception of the &quot;Lonesome Polecat&quot; number, the lament of the brothers for the women, and the two worked out the music and lyrics.

By the mid-1950s, Hollywood&#x27;s output of movie musicals had begun to wane, and he worked on only two more during the rest of the decade. He made his movie acting debut in &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955), directed by Gene Kelly and Donen, in which Kelly, Kidd and Dan Dailey played three ex-GIs meeting 10 years after the war, only to discover they had little in common. The film featured an exuberant number in which the three dance with garbage can lids fastened to their feet. The downbeat film was a critical success but was not heavily promoted by the studio, and failed at the box office. The film was originally designed to be a sequel to the 1949 film &quot;On the Town&quot;, but Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin were unavailable, and the film lacked chemistry among the three actors. The production was marked by constant strife between Donen and Kelly, with much of it stemming from Donen&#x27;s striving unsuccessfully to include &quot;Jack and the Space Giants&quot;, a 10-minute dance solo by Kidd. Kelly rejected this, which Kidd took as a personal insult, and Donen went further, ending his collaboration with Kelly for the rest of their lives. The &quot;Jack&quot; number appears as a bonus feature on a DVD of the film, and one commentator suggests that Kelly&#x27;s judgment was not wrong as the number was listless and did not advance the plot.

Kidd was both director and choreographer for the musical comedy film &quot;Merry Andrew&quot; (1958), starring Danny Kaye. By then, the era of movie musicals was pretty much over, and Kidd turned his attention to Broadway, where he had continued to work while choreographing movies. At the same time that he was choreographing &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, he was staging dances for Cole Porter’s Broadway musical &quot;Can-Can&quot;. In this show, he created dance numbers for Gwen Verdon that helped make her a Broadway sensation.

His other Broadway shows during the 1950s included &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; in 1956, which he directed as well as choreographed. He won another Tony Award for his choreography, which was adapted for the film version in 1959. After &quot;Merry Andrew,&quot; however, he made no other films until &quot;Star!, &quot;with Julie Andrews, in 1968. Neither film was successful&quot;. &quot;

On Broadway, he directed and choreographed &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1959), with Andy Griffith, &quot;Wildcat&quot; (1960), which starred Lucille Ball, &quot;Subways Are for Sleeping&quot; (1961), a musical comedy about homelessness, and &quot;Ben Franklin in Paris&quot; (1964), starring Robert Preston. He also choreographed the famous Broadway flop &quot;&quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; &quot;(1966), a musical version of the Truman Capote novella with Mary Tyler Moore and Richard Chamberlain that never officially opened. 

He choreographed the 1969 film adaptation of the hit Broadway play &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; The film was beset by tension on the unhappy set, with Barbra Streisand clashing with her costar Walter Matthau and director Gene Kelly; Kidd also had conflicts with costume designer Irene Sharaff and Kelly to the point that he and Kelly were no longer on speaking terms. The film was not a success as a musical, with Kelly and Kidd making little use of the widescreen format of the film. Critic Tom Santopietro described their approach as &quot;shoveling more and more bodies on screen with no apparent purpose&quot;.

He went on to direct and choreograph the 1970 Broadway musical &quot;The Rothschilds&quot;, starring Hal Linden, and directed &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;, with Bernadette Peters and Martin Short, a 1993 adaptation of the 1977 Neil Simon film that was his final Broadway play. Although he was nominated for a Tony Award for best director, reviews were mixed. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frank Rich wrote that &quot;Kidd, who did much to define slam-bang Broadway and Hollywood musical-comedy style in the 1950s, directs &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; in a mechanical reduction of that style: Everything is fast, furious, loud and downstage center. Not that any director could overcome this musical&#x27;s physical production.&quot;

Kidd appeared in supporting roles as a character actor in the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with his performance as the faded, cynical choreographer for a cheesy beauty pageant in the satirical 1975 film &quot;Smile&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert called Kidd&#x27;s portrayal of the pageant choreographer a &quot;finely etched semiautobiographical performance&quot;. He acted in and staged the musical sequences in the 1978 film &quot;Movie Movie&quot;, which was directed by Stanley Donen, with whom he&#x27;d worked in &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot;. Kidd directed an episode of the TV comedy &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (1976) as well as scenes for Janet Jackson in two music videos: &quot;When I Think of You&quot; (1986) and &quot;Alright&quot; (1990). He conceived and choreographed the television special &quot;Baryshnikov in Hollywood&quot;, starring Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1982, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award.

==Personal life==
Kidd died of cancer at the age 92 at his home in Los Angeles, California. His marriage to the dancer Mary Heater in 1940 ended in divorce. At his death, he was survived by his wife Shelah Hackett, whom he married in 1969, two daughters from his first marriage, and a son and daughter from his second.

Kidd was the uncle of filmmaker and political activist Robert Greenwald. His older brother was Harold Greenwald, a prominent psychotherapist and best-selling author of the 1958 book &quot;The Call Girl&quot;, who was an expert in the study of prostitution.

==Choreographic style==
Kidd was unusually well-respected, and his judgment was granted deference by the leading dancers of his era. British critic and biographer Michael Freedland said at the time of his death that &quot;when Gene Kelly danced through the street with a dustbin lid tied to his feet in the 1955 film &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot;, the man who usually planned his own routines did it to Kidd&#x27;s order&quot;.

His realistic approach, designing dances that were inspired by the way ordinary people behaved, led one critic to observe that &quot;Kidd is, in a way, the originator of the fantasy that if only your life shaped up and offered you the right moments, you too would be able to dance like a Hollywood star&quot;.

Kidd believed that dance needed to derive from life, saying that his &quot;dancing is based on naturalistic movement that is abstracted and enlarged&quot;, and that &quot;all my movements relate to some kind of real activity&quot;. He always wanted dance to serve the story, and when beginning a new work he would write a scenario, explaining how the plot drove the characters to dance. His biggest influences were Charlie Chaplin, &quot;because he expressed through movement the aspirations of the little man&quot;, and the dancer and choreographer Léonide Massine, &quot;because he expressed more than just balletic ability—he was always a character on stage, an exaggerated character, which I do all the time: an exaggeration of ordinary movement&quot;.

His distinct style was evident in his early days in ballet. Describing a rare film clip of his performance in &quot;On Stage&quot;, dance critic Anna Kisselgoff recounted that Kidd in one scene played a handyman consoling ballerina Janet Reed, playing a shy young woman at a ballet audition. &quot;Classical technique was used to expressive purpose as the wonderful Miss Reed grew visibly exuberant and confident as Mr. Kidd, broom in hand, entertained her with his virtuosic performance.&quot;

He once said that &quot;in choreography, ordinary movements from real life are taken and extended, so they become dance movements, yet the relation to reality must always be there. It&#x27;s important for me to know who the characters are and what their function is in the script. I must be able to illustrate either their activities, their emotions, or their changes in mood by the way they dance, all the while keeping the dance movements footed in reality and yet making the movements sort of odd and eccentric.&quot; This philosophy was reflected in the early scene from &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, when Fred Astaire walks down a railroad platform singing &quot;By Myself.&quot; His walk was not quite a dance, and epitomized Kidd&#x27;s style.

In a 2012 appreciation of his work, &quot;Dance Teacher&quot; stated that &quot;Kidd drew from the vocabularies of ballet, modern, social dance and acrobatics. But above all, his choreography stemmed from realistic movements and gestures. Following in the tradition of Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins, who developed the integrated musical, Kidd created dances that helped to carry the plot and flesh out the characters. He put the story first, communicating it through dance.&quot; Kidd once said that &quot;every move, every turn should mean something. Dancing should be completely understandable.&quot; In &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; he employed leading ballet dancers, but insisted that his dancers avoid ballet dance moves, and instead focus on &quot;work movements like ax wielding&quot;.

In choreographing &quot;Seven Brides&quot;, Kidd once said that he &quot;had to find a way to have these backwoods men dance without looking ridiculous. I had to base it all around activities you would accept from such people—it couldn&#x27;t look like ballet. And it could only have been done by superbly trained dancers.&quot; Yet he was able to integrate into the cast Russ Tamblyn, a non-dancer MGM contract player who was assigned to the film, by using his talents as a gymnast and tumbler in the dance numbers.

Kidd&#x27;s personal favorite of the films he choreographed, however, was not &quot;Seven Brides&quot; or &quot;Band Wagon &quot;but &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, which he felt was &quot;the best, most inventive and best integrated musical I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

Although he came from the world of classic ballet, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic noted at his death that he had &quot;a healthy disdain for its pretensions&quot;. He staged a comedic ballet sequence for the 1954 Danny Kaye film &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;, in which Kaye is chased into a theater and hides on stage during a performance by a Russian ballet company. The sequence allowed Kidd to lampoon the stylistic excesses he&#x27;d observed as a dancer at the American Ballet Theatre.

As in his choreography for both the Broadway and 1955 film adaptation of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and in the &quot;Girl Hunt Ballet&quot;, Kidd&#x27;s choreography in &quot;Seven Brides&quot; exuded masculinity. One history of the musical theater observes that &quot;Kidd forged dances, and shows, in which men were men, leaping high, stout hearted, and passionate about their dolls&quot;. He choreographed &quot;for the little guy, the working guy, the guy defined by his job and the movement that job entailed&quot;.

Although Kidd drove his dancers hard, partly because he himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he required of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in &quot;Love Life&quot;, could only make dancing turns to the left side because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd &quot;found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left&quot;. Julie Andrews recalled that the &quot;Burlington Bertie From Bow&quot; number in &quot;Star!&quot; was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that &quot;he looked crestfallen. Then he said &#x27;I wasn&#x27;t trying to be mean. I just knew that when you saw it on film, you wouldn&#x27;t be pleased.&#x27; I always thought that was a nice way to say &#x27;Once more.

==Awards==
Kidd was the first choreographer to win five Tony Awards, and received nine Tony nominations. He was awarded an Academy Honorary Award in 1997 &quot;in recognition of his services to the art of dance in the art of the screen&quot;.

He was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981.

It was an ordinary rescue mission for dam controller Togashi Teruo (Yūji Oda) and his colleague Yoshioka Kazushi as they set out to assist a few climbers who met an unexpected blizzard near the Okutowa Dam. Unfortunately, Yoshioka was injured while helping the others and Togashi had no choice but to seek help alone. Things got worse when WHITEOUT - a meteorological phenomenon – appeared and Togashi lost his best friend forever.

Meanwhile, with the most advanced technology, Utsuki Hirotaka (Koichi Sato) and his group of terrorists blow up the only main road to Okutowa Dam, the largest dam in Japan. They take over the dam along with the workers as hostages. They demanded JPY 5 billion from the government with a 24-hour deadline. To let the government know that they mean business, they decide to kill the hostages one by one unless they hear a definite answer from the highest government official. Among the hostages is Hirakawa Chiaki (Nanako Matsushima), Yoshioka’s fiancée whom Togashi promised his best friend to take good care of if anything bad should happen to Togashi.

To make things more complicated, there was a snowstorm and no one can get in or out from the dam. Either the government pays the ransom or the dam will be blown up, spelling doom for the 200,000 residents living close to it. Fortunately, Togashi was not captured by the terrorists and he is now on his own to fight the well-equipped terrorists and to rescue both Hirakawa and the Okutowa Dam alone.

==Release==
&quot;Whiteout&quot; was released in Japan on 19 August 2000 where it was distributed by Toho and was the number one film in Japan for the weekend.

<text>MobyGames is a commercial website that catalogs information on video games and the people and companies behind them via crowdsourcing. This includes nearly 300,000 games for hundreds of platforms. The site is supported by banner ads and a small number of people paying to become patrons. Founded in 1999, ownership of the site has changed hands several times. It has been owned by Atari SA since 2022.

==Overview==
The database began in 1999 with games for IBM PC compatibles. Home console games started being added in 2001, arcade video games in January 2014, and mainframe computer games in June 2017.

Edits and submissions go through a leisurely verification process by volunteer &quot;approvers&quot;. This can range from immediate (minutes) to gradual (days or months). The most commonly used sources are the video game&#x27;s website, packaging, and credit screens. There is a published standard for game information and copyediting.

Registered users can rate and review any video game. Users can create private or public &quot;have&quot; and &quot;want&quot; lists which can generate a list of games available for trade with other registered users. The site contains an integrated forum. Each listed game can have its own subforum.

==History==
MobyGames was founded on March 1, 1999 by Jim Leonard and Brian Hirt, and joined by David Berk 18 months later, three friends since high school. Leonard had the idea of sharing information about computer games with a larger audience.

In mid-2010, MobyGames was purchased by GameFly for an undisclosed amount. This was announced to the community &quot;post factum&quot; and a few major contributors left, refusing to do volunteer work for a commercial website.

On December 18, 2013, MobyGames was acquired by Jeremiah Freyholtz, owner of Blue Flame Labs (a San-Francisco-based game and web development company) and VGBoxArt (a site for fan-made video game box art). Blue Flame Labs reverted MobyGames&#x27; interface to its pre-overhaul look and feel.

On November 24, 2021, Atari SA announced a potential deal with Blue Flame Labs to purchase MobyGames for $1.5 million. The purchase was completed on 8 March 2022, with Freyholtz remaining as general manager.

<text>Homi Kharshedji Bhabha (; born 1 November 1949) is an Indian scholar and critical theorist. He is the Anne F. Rothenberg Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University. He is one of the most important figures in contemporary postcolonial studies, and has developed a number of the field&#x27;s neologisms and key concepts, such as hybridity, mimicry, difference, and ambivalence. Such terms describe ways in which colonised people have resisted the power of the coloniser, according to Bhabha&#x27;s theory. In 2012, he received the Padma Bhushan award in the field of literature and education from the Indian government. He is married to attorney and Harvard lecturer Jacqueline Bhabha, and they have three children.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Born in Bombay, India, into a Parsi family, Bhabha graduated with a B.A. from Elphinstone College at the University of Mumbai and an M.A., M.Phil., and D.Phil. in English Literature from Christ Church, Oxford University.

=== Career ===
After lecturing in the Department of English at the University of Sussex for more than ten years, Bhabha received a senior fellowship at Princeton University where he was also made Old Dominion Visiting Professor. He was Steinberg Visiting Professor at the University of Pennsylvania where he delivered the Richard Wright Lecture Series. At Dartmouth College, Bhabha was a faculty fellow at the School of Criticism and Theory. From 1997 to 2001, he served as Chester D. Tripp Professor in the Humanities at the University of Chicago. In 2001–02, he served as a distinguished visiting professor at University College, London. He has been the Anne F. Rothenberg Professor of English and American Literature and Language at Harvard University since 2001. Bhabha also serves on the Editorial Collective of &quot;Public Culture&quot;, an academic journal published by Duke University Press. He served on the Humanities jury for the Infosys Prize for three years. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan award by the Government of India in 2012.

==Work==

===Hybridity===

One of his central ideas is that of &quot;hybridisation,&quot; which, taking up from Edward Said&#x27;s work, describes the emergence of new cultural forms from multiculturalism. Instead of seeing colonialism as something locked in the past, Bhabha shows how its histories and cultures constantly intrude on the present, demanding that we transform our understanding of cross-cultural relations. His work transformed the study of colonialism by applying post-structuralist methodologies to colonial texts.

===Ambivalence===
The idea of ambivalence sees culture as consisting of opposing perceptions and dimensions. Bhabha claims that this ambivalence—this duality that presents a split in the identity of the colonized other—allows for beings who are a hybrid of their own cultural identity and the colonizer&#x27;s cultural identity. Ambivalence contributes to the reason why colonial power is characterized by its belatedness. Colonial signifiers of authority only acquire their meanings after the &quot;traumatic scenario of colonial difference, cultural or racial, returns the eye of power to some prior archaic image or identity. Paradoxically, however, such an image can neither be &#x27;original&#x27;—by virtue of the act of repetition that constructs it—nor identical—by virtue of the difference that defines it.&quot; Accordingly, the colonial presence remains ambivalent, split between its appearance as original and authoritative and its articulation as repetition and difference. This opens up the two dimensions of colonial discourse: that which is characterized by invention and mastery and that of displacement and fantasy.

===Cultural difference, enunciation, and stereotype===
Bhabha presents cultural difference as an alternative to cultural diversity. In cultural diversity, a culture is an &quot;object of empirical knowledge&quot; and pre-exists the knower while cultural difference sees culture as the point at which two or more cultures meet and it is also where most problems occur, discursively constructed rather than pre-given, a &quot;process of enunciation of culture as &#x27;knowledgeable.&#x27;&quot; Enunciation is the act of utterance or expression of a culture that takes place in the Third Space. Since culture is never pre-given, it must be uttered. It is through enunciation that cultural difference is discovered and recognized. The enunciative process introduces a divide between the traditions of a stable system of reference and the negation of the certitude of culture in the articulation of new cultural, meanings, strategies, in the political present, as a practice of domination, or resistance.

Consequently, cultural difference is a process of identification, while cultural diversity is comparative and categorized. Moreover, it is that possibility of difference and articulation that could free the signifier of skin/culture from the fixations of racial typology, however, the stereotype impedes the circulation and articulation of the signifier of &quot;race&quot; as anything other than that. An important aspect of colonial and post-colonial discourse is their dependence on the concept of &quot;fixity&quot; in the construction of otherness. Fixity implies repetition, rigidity and an unchanging order as well as disorder. The stereotype depends on this notion of fixity. The stereotype creates an &quot;identity&quot; that stems as much from mastery and pleasure as it does from anxiety and defense of the dominant, &quot;for it is a form of multiple and contradictory beliefs in its recognition of difference and disavowal of it.&quot;

===Mimicry===
Like Bhabha&#x27;s concept of hybridity, mimicry is a metonym of presence. Mimicry appears when members of a colonized society imitate and take on the culture of the colonizers. Jacques Lacan asserts, &quot;The effect of mimicry is camouflage...it is not a question of harmonizing with the background, but against a mottled background, of becoming mottled.&quot; Colonial mimicry comes from the colonist&#x27;s desire for a reformed, recognizable Other, as a subject of a difference that is, as Bhabha writes, &quot;almost the same, but not quite.&quot; Thus, mimicry is a sign of a double articulation; a strategy which appropriates the Other as it visualizes power. Furthermore, mimicry is the sign of the inappropriate, &quot;a difference or recalcitrance which coheres the dominant strategic function of colonial power, intensifies surveillance, and poses an imminent threat to both &#x27;normalized&#x27; knowledges and disciplinary powers.&quot;

In this way, mimicry gives the colonial subject a partial presence, as if the &#x27;colonial&#x27; is dependent for its representation within the authoritative discourse itself. Ironically, the colonists desire to emerge as &#x27;authentic&#x27; through mimicry—through a process of writing and repetition—through this partial representation. On the other hand, Bhabha does not interpret mimicry as a narcissistic identification of the colonizer in which the colonized stops being a person without the colonizer present in his identity. He sees mimicry as a &quot;double vision which in disclosing the ambivalence of colonial discourse also disrupts its authority. And it is a double vision that is a result of what [he has] described as the partial representation/recognition of the colonial object...the figures of a doubling, the part-objects of a metonymy of colonial desire which alienates the modality and normality of those dominate discourses in which they emerge as &#x27;inappropriate colonial subjects&#x27;.&quot;

The colonized&#x27;s desire is inverted as the colonial appropriation now produces a partial vision of the colonizer&#x27;s presence; a gaze from the Other is the counterpart to the colonizer&#x27;s gaze that shares the insight of genealogical gaze which frees the marginalized individual and breaks the unity of man&#x27;s being through which he had extended his sovereignty. Thus, &quot;the observer becomes the observed and &#x27;partial&#x27; representation rearticulates the whole notion of identity and alienates it from essence.&quot;

===Third Space===

The Third Space acts as an ambiguous area that develops when two or more individuals/cultures interact (compare this to urbanist Edward W. Soja&#x27;s conceptualization of thirdspace). It &quot;challenges our sense of the historical identity of culture as a homogenizing, unifying force, authenticated by the originary past, kept alive in the national tradition of the People.&quot; This ambivalent area of discourse, which serves as a site for the discursive conditions of enunciation, &quot;displaces the narrative of the Western written in homogeneous, serial time.&quot; It does so through the &quot;disruptive temporality of enunciation.&quot; Bhabha claims that &quot;cultural statements and systems are constructed in this contradictory and ambivalent space of enunciation.&quot; As a result, the hierarchical claims to the innate originality or purity of cultures are invalid. Enunciation implies that culture has no fixity and even the same signs can be appropriated, translated, rehistoricized, and read anew.

===Influences===
Bhabha&#x27;s work in postcolonial theory owes much to post-structuralism. Notable among Bhabha&#x27;s influences include Jacques Derrida and deconstruction; Jacques Lacan and Lacanian psychoanalysis; and Michel Foucault&#x27;s notion of discursivity. Additionally, in a 1995 interview with W. J. T. Mitchell, Bhabha stated that Edward Said is the writer who has most influenced him. In the social sciences, Edward W. Soja has most thoroughly relied on and transformed Bhabha&#x27;s approaches to understanding notion of space, action, and representation.

==Reception==
Bhabha has been criticized for using indecipherable jargon and dense prose. In 1998, the journal &quot;Philosophy and Literature&quot; awarded Bhabha second prize in its &quot;Bad Writing Competition,&quot; which &quot;celebrates bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles.&quot; Bhabha was awarded the prize for a sentence in &quot;The Location of Culture&quot; (Routledge, 1994):

:If, for a while, the ruse of desire is calculable for the uses of discipline soon the repetition of guilt, justification, pseudo-scientific theories, superstition, spurious authorities, and classifications can be seen as the desperate effort to &quot;normalize&quot; formally the disturbance of a discourse of splitting that violates the rational, enlightened claims of its enunciatory modality.

Professor Emeritus of English at Stanford University Marjorie Perloff said that her reaction to Bhabha&#x27;s appointment to the Harvard faculty was one of &quot;dismay,&quot; telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have anything to say.&quot; Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at New York University, remarked on Bhabha&#x27;s writing: &quot;One could finally argue that there is no meaning there, beyond the neologisms and Latinate buzzwords. Most of the time I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about.&quot;

In a 2005 interview, Bhabha expressed his annoyance at such criticisms and the implied expectation that philosophers should use the &quot;common language of the common person,&quot; while scientists are given a pass for the similar use of language that is not immediately comprehensible to casual readers. In his review entitled &quot;Goodbye to the Enlightenment,&quot; Terry Eagleton provided a more substantive critique of Bhabha&#x27;s work, explaining in &quot;The Guardian&quot; (8 February 1994) that &quot;Bhabha&#x27;s aim is to put the skids under every cherished doctrine of Western Enlightenment, from the idea of progress to the unity of the self, from the classical work of art to the notions of law and civility.&quot; Bhabha uses India, for instance, as an example of alternative possibilities when he argues that the very idea and practice of secularism is changing.

In February 2022, Bhabha was one of 38 Harvard faculty to sign a letter to &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; defending Professor John Comaroff, who had been found to have violated the university&#x27;s sexual and professional conduct policies. The letter defended Comaroff as &quot;an excellent colleague, advisor and committed university citizen&quot; and expressed dismay over his being sanctioned by the university. After students filed a lawsuit with detailed allegations of Comaroff&#x27;s actions and the university&#x27;s failure to respond, Bhabha was one of several signatories to say that he wished to retract his signature. 

==Personal life==
He is married to attorney and Harvard lecturer Jacqueline Bhabha. The couple have three children together named Leah Bhabha, Ishan Bhabha, and Satya Bhabha. Bhabha is famous for hosting dinner parties. He also prefers to cook meat with bones; he told one reporter, &quot;It&#x27;s the bones that make a dish. I always use the bone, never without.&quot;

<doc id="610527" wikidata="Q1545164" url="?curid=610527" title="Whiteout (weather)">
<text>Whiteout or white-out is a weather condition in which visibility and contrast are severely reduced by snow, fog, or sand. The horizon disappears from view while the sky and landscape appear featureless, leaving no points of visual reference by which to navigate.

A whiteout may be due simply to extremely heavy snowfall rates as seen in lake effect conditions, or to other factors such as diffuse lighting from overcast clouds, mist or fog, or a background of snow. A person traveling in a true whiteout is at significant risk of becoming completely disoriented and losing their way, even in familiar surroundings. Motorists typically have to stop their cars where they are, as the road is impossible to see. Normal snowfalls and blizzards, where snow is falling at /h), or where the relief visibility is not clear yet having a clear field of view for over , are often incorrectly called whiteouts.

==Types==
There are three different forms of a whiteout:
# In blizzard conditions, snow already on the ground can become windblown, reducing visibility to near zero.
# In snowfall conditions, the volume of snow falling may obscure objects reducing visibility to near zero. An example of this is during lake-effect snow or mountain-effect snow, where the volume of snow can be many times greater than normal snows or blizzards.
# Where ground-level thick fog exists in a snow-covered environment, especially on open areas devoid of features.

==Variations==
A whiteout should not be confused with flat-light. Whilst there are similarities, both the causes and effects are different.

A whiteout is a reduction and scattering of sunlight.
: Cause: Sunlight is blocked, reduced and scattered by ice crystals in falling snow, wind-blown spin-drift, water droplets in low-lying clouds or localised fog, etc. The remaining scattered light is merged and blended.

: Result: Due to a reduction in reflected light, visual references e.g. the horizon, terrain features, slope aspect, etc. are significantly reduced or completely blocked. This leads to an inability to position yourself relative to the surroundings. In severe conditions an individual may experience a loss of kinesthesia (ability to discern position and movement), confusion, loss of balance, and an overall reduction in the ability to operate.

Flat-light is a diffusion of sunlight.
: Cause: Sunlight is both scattered and diffused by atmospheric particles (e.g. water molecules, ice crystals) and by snow lying on the ground; this causes light to be received from multiple directions. Commonly, the effect is increased during a whiteout and/or later in the day when the sun drops towards the horizon, due to sunlight passing through the atmosphere for a greater distance.

: Result: Light is received from multiple directions with each light source producing overlapping shadows which cancel-out each other. This dulls the area and removes indicators such as tones and contrast, making it difficult to discern similarly coloured slope features. The loss of visual indicators of shape and edge detail results in objects and features seeming to blend into each other, producing a flat featureless vista. An effect of visual blending may be a loss of depth of field resulting in disorientation.

==Hazards==

Whiteout conditions pose threats to mountain climbers, skiers, aviation, and mobile ground traffic. Motorists, especially those on large high-speed routes, are also at risk. There have been many major multiple-vehicle collisions associated with whiteout conditions. One forward motorist may come to a complete stop when they cannot see the road, while the motorist behind is still moving.

Local, short-duration whiteout conditions can be created artificially in the vicinity of airports and helipads due to aircraft operations. Snow on the ground can be stirred up by helicopter rotor down-wash or airplane jet blast, presenting hazards to both aircraft and bystanders on the ground.

<text>In addition to the Beatles&#x27; films &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (1967), &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; (1968) and &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970), Ringo Starr also acted in films such as &quot;Candy&quot; (1968), &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; (1969, alongside Peter Sellers), &quot;Blindman&quot; (1971), &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; (1974) and &quot;Caveman&quot; (1981).
Starr directed and appeared in &quot;Born to Boogie&quot; (1972), a concert film featuring Marc Bolan and T. Rex. For the 1979 documentary film on the Who, &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;, Starr appeared in interview segments with fellow drummer Keith Moon. He starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;200 Motels&quot; (1971). His voice is also featured in Harry Nilsson&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Point!&quot; (1971).

In 1972, Starr made a brief cameo appearance at the end of an episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, entitled &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Brian Norris&#x27; Ford Popular&quot;. He co-starred in &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; (1973) as a Teddy Boy, and went on to appear in &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, the Martin Scorsese film about the 1976 farewell concert of the Band, a favourite of the Beatles. Starr played &#x27;The Pope&#x27; in Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975), and a fictionalised version of himself in Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot; in 1984. He also appeared as himself, and downtrodden alter-ego Ognir Rrats, in &quot;Ringo&quot; (1978), an American-made television comedy film based loosely on &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;.

Starr was best known to be the first narrator of the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; from 1984–86 for the British broadcast and from 1989–90 in the United States.

<text>The Windstar Foundation was an environmental education and humanitarian organization founded by John Denver and Thomas Crum in 1976 to conserve of land in Snowmass, Colorado, where it had its headquarters.

Windstar educated all age groups about the environment on a world-wide level. 

The Foundation closed its doors in October 2012, voted to dissolve, and sold its property for $8.5 million in early 2013. All but 30 acres of the land is subject to a conservation easement which prohibits development. Rocky Mountain Institute, which had its headquarters on the unprotected 30 acres and owned a 50% interest in the property, plans to move to Basalt, Colorado. Windstar&#x27;s $4-million portion of the proceeds was donated to an Aspen charity.

<text>English musician Ringo Starr has released 21 studio albums and 54 singles. Starr achieved international fame as a member of British rock band the Beatles. 

After the band&#x27;s break-up in 1970, Starr released several successful singles including the US top-ten hit &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;, and number ones &quot;Photograph&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot;. His most successful UK single was &quot;Back Off Boogaloo&quot;, which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album &quot;Ringo&quot;, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US.

Along with the other Beatles, he spent the first half of the 1970s on Apple Records, the label created by the band for themselves. Starr moved to Atlantic Records after his contract with EMI expired and his career diminished in commercial impact, even though he continued to record and eventually tour with his All-Starr Band in 1989.

<doc id="610532" wikidata="Q705525" url="?curid=610532" title="Peter Thiel">
<text>Peter Andreas Thiel (; born 11 October 1967) is an American entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and political activist. A co-founder of PayPal, Palantir Technologies, and Founders Fund, he was the first outside investor in Facebook. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, as of 17 February 2025, Thiel&#x27;s estimated net worth stood at US$20.5 billion, making him the 101st richest individual in the world.

Thiel has worked as a securities lawyer at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, a speechwriter for former U.S. secretary of education William Bennett, and a derivatives trader at Credit Suisse. He founded Thiel Capital Management in 1996 and co-founded PayPal with Max Levchin and Luke Nosek in 1998. He was the chief executive officer of PayPal until its sale to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

Following PayPal, Thiel founded Clarium Capital, a global macro hedge fund based in San Francisco. In 2003, he launched Palantir Technologies, a big data analysis company, and has been its chairman since its inception. In 2005, Thiel launched Founders Fund with PayPal partners Ken Howery and Luke Nosek. Thiel became Facebook&#x27;s first outside investor when he acquired a 10.2% stake in the company for $500,000 in August 2004. He sold the majority of his shares in Facebook for over $1 billion in 2012, and stepped down from the board of directors in 2022. He co-founded Valar Ventures in 2010, co-founded Mithril Capital, was investment committee chair, in 2012, and was a part-time partner at Y Combinator from 2015 to 2017.

Thiel is a conservative libertarian who has made substantial donations to American right-wing figures and causes. He was controversially granted New Zealand citizenship in 2011 after the Fifth National Government intervened on his behalf. Thiel had spent 12 non-consecutive days in the country, a fraction of the normal residency requirement of 1,350 days for citizenship.

Through the Thiel Foundation, Thiel governs the grant-making bodies Breakout Labs and Thiel Fellowship, which fund non-profit research into artificial intelligence, life extension, and seasteading. In 2016, Thiel confirmed that he had funded Hulk Hogan in the &quot;Bollea v. Gawker&quot; lawsuit because &quot;Gawker&quot; had previously outed Thiel as gay. The lawsuit eventually bankrupted &quot;Gawker&quot;, and led to founder Nick Denton&#x27;s bankruptcy.

==Early life and education==

Thiel was born in Frankfurt am Main, then part of West Germany, on 11 October 1967, to Klaus Friedrich Thiel and his wife Susanne Thiel. The family emigrated to the United States when Peter was one year old and lived in Cleveland, Ohio, where his father worked as a chemical engineer. Klaus worked for various mining companies, which created an itinerant upbringing for Thiel and his younger brother, Patrick Michael Thiel. Thiel&#x27;s mother became a U.S. citizen, but his father did not. Thiel eventually became a U.S. citizen as well.

Before settling in Foster City, California, in 1977, the Thiel family lived in South Africa and South West Africa (modern-day Namibia). Peter changed elementary schools seven times. He attended a school in Swakopmund that required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment, such as striking students&#x27; hands with a ruler. He said this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in his support for individualism and libertarianism.

Thiel played &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and was an avid reader of science fiction, with Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein among his favorite authors. He is a fan of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s works, stating as an adult that he had read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; over ten times. Six firms (Palantir Technologies, Valar Ventures, Mithril Capital, Lembas LLC, Rivendell LLC and Arda Capital) that Thiel founded adopted names originating from Tolkien.

Thiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a California-wide mathematics competition while attending Bowditch Middle School in Foster City. At San Mateo High School, he read Ayn Rand and admired the optimism and anti-communism of then-President Ronald Reagan. He was valedictorian of his graduating class in 1985.

Thiel studied philosophy at Stanford University. The replacement of a &quot;Western Culture&quot; program at Stanford with a &quot;Culture, Ideas and Values&quot; course that addressed diversity and multiculturalism prompted Thiel to co-found &quot;The Stanford Review&quot;, a conservative and libertarian newspaper, in 1987. The paper received funding from Irving Kristol. Thiel was &quot;The Stanford Review&#x27;s&quot; first editor-in-chief until he graduated in 1989. Thiel has maintained his relationship with the paper, consulting with staff, donating to the newspaper, and placing graduating students in internships or jobs within his network.

Thiel enrolled in Stanford Law School and earned his juris doctor degree in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paypal,-Inc-Jan-2002-S-1/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While at Stanford, Thiel met René Girard, whose mimetic theory influenced him.

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduating from Stanford Law School, Thiel clerked for Judge James Larry Edmondson of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Thiel then worked as a securities lawyer for Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in New York. He left the law firm in under a year. He then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at Credit Suisse in 1993 while also working as a speechwriter for former United States Secretary of Education William Bennett. Thiel returned to California in 1996.

Upon returning to the Bay Area, Thiel capitalized on the dot-com boom. With financial support from friends and family, he raised $1 million toward the establishment of Thiel Capital Management and embarked on his venture capital career. Early on, he experienced a setback after investing $100,000 in his friend Luke Nosek&#x27;s unsuccessful web-based calendar project. Soon thereafter, Nosek&#x27;s friend Max Levchin described to Thiel his cryptography-related company idea, which became their first venture called Fieldlink (later renamed Confinity) in 1998.

===PayPal===

With Confinity, Thiel realized they could develop software to bridge a gap in making online payments. Although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more payment options, not all merchants had the necessary hardware to accept credit cards. Thus, consumers had to pay with exact cash or check. Thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet for consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices, and in 1999 Confinity launched PayPal.

PayPal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money. Thiel viewed PayPal&#x27;s mission as liberating people from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation. Thiel spoke in 1999:

When PayPal launched at a press conference in 1999, representatives from Nokia and Deutsche Bank sent $3 million in venture funding to Thiel using PayPal on their PalmPilots. PayPal then continued to grow through mergers in 2000 with Elon Musk&#x27;s online financial services company X.com, and with Pixo, a company specializing in mobile commerce. These mergers allowed PayPal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more user-friendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information. PayPal went public on 15 February 2002 and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October of that year. Thiel remained CEO of the company until the sale. His 3.7% stake in the company was worth $55 million at the time of acquisition. In Silicon Valley circles, Thiel is colloquially referred to as the &quot;Don of the PayPal Mafia&quot;.

===Clarium Capital===

Thiel used $10 million of his proceeds to create Clarium Capital Management, a global macro hedge fund focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies, interest rates, commodities, and equities. Thiel stated that &quot;the big, macroeconomic idea that we had at Clarium—the idée fixe—was the peak-oil theory, which was basically that the world was running out of oil, and that there were no easy alternatives.&quot;

In 2003, Thiel successfully bet that the United States dollar would weaken. In 2004, Thiel spoke of the dot-com bubble having migrated, in effect, into a growing bubble in the financial sector, and specified General Electric and Walmart as vulnerable. In 2005, Clarium saw a 57.1% return as Thiel predicted that the dollar would rally.

However, Clarium faltered in 2006 with a 7.8% loss. Thereafter, the firm sought to profit in the long-term from its petrodollar analysis, which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies. Clarium&#x27;s assets under management grew after achieving a 40.3% return in 2007 to more than $7 billion by the first quarter of 2008, but fell later in the year and again in 2009 after financial markets collapsed. By 2011, after missing out on the economic rebound, many key investors pulled out, reducing the value of Clarium&#x27;s assets to $350 million, two thirds of which was Thiel&#x27;s money.

===Palantir===

In May 2003, Thiel incorporated Palantir Technologies, a big data analysis company named after the Tolkien artifact. He continues as its chairman, as of 2022. Thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that &quot;the approaches that PayPal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts, like fighting terrorism&quot;. He also stated that, after the September 11 attacks, the debate in the United States was &quot;will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy?&quot;. He envisioned Palantir as providing data mining services to government intelligence agencies that were maximally unintrusive and traceable.

Palantir&#x27;s first backer was the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s venture capital arm In-Q-Tel. The company steadily grew and in 2015 was valued at $20 billion, with Thiel being the company&#x27;s largest shareholder.

===Facebook===

In August 2004, Thiel made a $500,000 angel investment in Facebook for a 10.2% stake in the company and joined Facebook&#x27;s board. This was the first outside investment in Facebook and valued the company at $4.9 million. As a board member, Thiel was not actively involved in Facebook&#x27;s operations. He provided help with timing the various rounds of funding and Zuckerberg credited Thiel with helping him time Facebook&#x27;s 2007 Series D, which closed before the 2008 financial crisis.

In his book &quot;The Facebook Effect&quot;, David Kirkpatrick outlines how Thiel came to make this investment: Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who at the time had assumed the title of &quot;President&quot; of Facebook, was seeking investors. Parker approached Reid Hoffman, the CEO of work-based social network LinkedIn. Hoffman liked Facebook but declined to become lead investor because of the potential for conflict of interest. Hoffman directed Parker to Thiel, whom he knew from their PayPal days. Thiel met Parker and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Thiel and Zuckerberg got along well, and Thiel agreed to lead Facebook&#x27;s seed round with $500,000 for 10.2% of the company. The investment was originally in the form of a convertible note, to be converted to equity if Facebook reached 1.5 million users by the end of 2004. Although Facebook narrowly missed the target, Thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway. Thiel said of his investment: &quot;I was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision. And it was a very reasonable valuation. I thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment.&quot;

In September 2010, Thiel, while expressing skepticism about the potential for growth in the consumer Internet sector, argued that relative to other Internet companies, Facebook (which then had a secondary market valuation of $30 billion) was comparatively undervalued. Facebook&#x27;s initial public offering was in May 2012, with a market cap of nearly $100 billion ($38 a share), at which time Thiel sold 16.8 million shares for $638 million. In August 2012, immediately upon the conclusion of the early investor lock-up period, Thiel sold almost all of his remaining stake for between $19.27 and $20.69 per share, or $395.8 million, for a total of more than $1 billion. He retained his seat on the board of directors. In 2016, he sold a little under 1 million of his shares for around $100 million. In November 2017, he sold another 160,805 shares for $29 million, putting his holdings in Facebook at 59,913 Class A shares. As of April 2020, he owned less than 10,000 shares in Facebook.

On 7 February 2022, Thiel announced he would not stand for re-election to the board of Facebook owner Meta at the 2022 annual stockholders&#x27; meeting and would leave after 17 years in order to support pro–Donald Trump candidates in the 2022 United States elections.

===Founders Fund===

In 2005, Thiel created Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund. Other partners in the fund include Sean Parker, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek.

In addition to Facebook, Thiel made early-stage investments in numerous startups (personally or through Founders Fund), including Airbnb, Slide.com, LinkedIn, Friendster, RapLeaf, Geni.com, Yammer, Yelp Inc., Spotify, Powerset, Practice Fusion, MetaMed, Vator, SpaceX, Palantir Technologies, IronPort, Votizen, Asana, Big Think, CapLinked, Quora, Nanotronics Imaging, Rypple, TransferWise, Stripe, Block.one, and AltSchool. Thiel also backed DeepMind, a UK start-up that was acquired by Google in early 2014 for £400 million.

In 2017, Founders Fund bought about $15–20 million worth of bitcoin. In January 2018, the firm told investors that due to the cryptocurrency&#x27;s surge the holdings were worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Also in 2017, Thiel was one of the first outside investors in Clearview AI, a facial recognition technology startup that has raised concerns in the tech world and media for its risks of weaponization.

===Valar Ventures===

Through Valar Ventures, an internationally focused venture firm he cofounded with Andrew McCormack and James Fitzgerald, Thiel was an early investor in Xero, a software firm headquartered in New Zealand. Valar Ventures also invested in New Zealand-based companies Pacific Fibre and Booktrack.

===Mithril Capital===
In June 2012, he launched Mithril Capital Management, named after the fictitious metal in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, with Jim O&#x27;Neill and Ajay Royan. Unlike Clarium Capital, Mithril Capital, a fund with $402 million at the time of launch, targets companies that are beyond the startup stage and ready to scale up.

===Y Combinator===
In March 2015, Thiel joined Y Combinator as one of 10 part-time partners. In November 2017, it was reported that Y Combinator had severed its ties with Thiel.

&quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that Thiel became an FBI informant in 2021.

== Gawker lawsuit ==

In May 2016, Thiel confirmed in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he had paid $10 million in legal expenses to finance several lawsuits brought by others, including a lawsuit by Terry Bollea (Hulk Hogan) against Gawker Media for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and infringement of personality rights after Gawker made sections of a sex tape involving Bollea public. The jury awarded Bollea $140 million, and Gawker announced it was permanently closing due to the lawsuit in August 2016. Thiel referred to his financial support of Bollea&#x27;s case as one of the &quot;greater philanthropic things that I&#x27;ve done.&quot;

Thiel said he was motivated to sue Gawker after they published a 2007 article publicly outing him, headlined &quot;Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.&quot; Thiel stated that Gawker articles about others, including his friends, had &quot;ruined people&#x27;s lives for no reason,&quot; and said, &quot;It&#x27;s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence.&quot; In response to criticism that his funding of lawsuits against Gawker could restrict the freedom of the press, Thiel cited his donations to the to Protect Journalists and stated, &quot;I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations. I think much more highly of journalists than that. It&#x27;s precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker.&quot;

On 15 August 2016, Thiel published an opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in which he argued that his defense of online privacy went beyond Gawker. He highlighted his support for the Intimate Privacy Protection Act and said that athletes and business executives have the right to stay in the closet as long as they want to.

== Political views and activities ==
=== Political views ===

Thiel is a self-described conservative libertarian. Since the late 2010s, he has espoused support for national conservatism, and criticized economically liberal attitudes towards free trade and big tech.

In 1995, Thiel and David O. Sacks published &quot;The Diversity Myth&quot;, a book that criticized political correctness and multiculturalism in higher education. The following year, writing for &quot;Stanford Magazine&quot;, they argued against affirmative action in the United States, saying that it had hurt, not helped, the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; and had led to increased segregation at Stanford University in the name of &quot;diversity&quot;.

&quot;The Straussian Moment&quot;, an essay written by Thiel in 2004, is sometimes considered to be a fundamental text in his political thinking and was the subject of a 2019 interview at the Hoover Institution. The essay draws on several thinkers and political theorists and argues that the September 11 attacks upset &quot;the entire political and military framework of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries&quot;, and therefore &quot;a reexamination of the foundations of modern politics&quot; was needed.

Thiel explained in a 2009 essay that he had come to &quot;no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible&quot;, due in large part to welfare beneficiaries and women in general being &quot;notoriously tough for libertarians&quot; constituencies, and that he had focused efforts on new technologies (namely cyberspace, space colonization and seasteading) that could create &quot;a new space for freedom&quot; beyond current politics. Said essay has been referenced by Curtis Yarvin and Nick Land, the main theorists of the neo-reactionary movement, in their writings.

In a 2015 conversation with Tyler Cowen, Thiel claimed that innovative breakthroughs were happening in computing/IT and not the physical world. He lamented the lack of progress in space travel, high-speed transit, and medical devices. As a cause for the discrepancy, he said: &quot;I would say that we lived in a world in which bits were unregulated and atoms were regulated.&quot;

In 2019, Thiel called Google &quot;seemingly treasonous&quot; and urged a government investigation, citing Google&#x27;s work with China and asking whether DeepMind or Google&#x27;s senior management had been &quot;infiltrated&quot; by foreign intelligence agencies.

Thiel is a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group, a private, annual gathering of intellectual figures, political leaders, and business executives.

=== Support for political activism ===
Thiel, who is gay, has supported mostly conservative gay rights causes such as the American Foundation for Equal Rights and GOProud. He invited conservative columnist and friend Ann Coulter to Homocon 2010 as a guest speaker. Coulter later dedicated her 2011 book, &quot;&quot;, to Thiel. Thiel is mentioned in the acknowledgments of Coulter&#x27;s &quot;¡Adios, America!: The Left&#x27;s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole&quot;. In 2012, Thiel donated $10,000 to Minnesotans United for All Families, in order to fight Minnesota Amendment 1 that proposed to ban marriage between same-sex couples there.

In 2009, it was reported that Thiel helped fund college student James O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s &quot;Taxpayers Clearing House&quot; video—a satirical look at the Wall Street bailout. O&#x27;Keefe went on to produce the ACORN undercover sting videos but, through a spokesperson, Thiel denied involvement in the ACORN sting.

In July 2012, Thiel made a $1 million donation to the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative 501(c)(4) organization, becoming the group&#x27;s largest contributor. Club for Growth is a conservative organization with an agenda focused on cutting taxes and other economic issues.

=== Support for political candidates ===

Thiel is a member of the Republican Party. He contributes to both Libertarian and Republican candidates and causes. In December 2007, Thiel endorsed Ron Paul for President in the 2008 United States presidential election. After Paul failed to secure the Republican nomination, Thiel contributed to the John McCain campaign.

In 2010, Thiel supported Republican Meg Whitman in her unsuccessful bid for the governorship of California. He contributed the maximum allowable $25,900 to the Whitman campaign.

In 2012, Thiel, along with Nosek and Scott Banister, put their support behind the Endorse Liberty Super PAC. Collectively they gave $3.9 million to Endorse Liberty, whose purpose was to promote Ron Paul. As of 31 January 2012, Endorse Liberty reported spending about $3.3 million promoting Paul by setting up two YouTube channels, buying ads from Google, Facebook and StumbleUpon, and building a presence on the Web. After Paul again failed to secure the nomination in the 2012 United States presidential election, Thiel contributed to the Mitt Romney/Paul Ryan presidential ticket of 2012.

Thiel initially supported Carly Fiorina&#x27;s campaign during the 2016 GOP presidential primary elections. After Fiorina dropped out, Thiel supported Donald Trump and became one of the California delegates for Trump&#x27;s nomination. He was a headline speaker during the 2016 Republican National Convention, during which he announced that he was &quot;proud to be gay,&quot; for which the assembled Republicans cheered. On 15 October 2016, Thiel announced a $1.25 million donation in support of Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign. Thiel stated to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t give him any money for a long time because I didn&#x27;t think it mattered, and then the campaign asked me to.&quot; After Trump&#x27;s victory, Thiel was named to the executive committee of the President-elect&#x27;s transition team. In July 2018, he donated $250,000 to the Trump Victory Committee in support of the Republican National Committee during the 2018 midterm elections and Trump&#x27;s 2020 re-election campaign.

By February 2022, Thiel was one of the largest donors to Republican candidates in the 2022 election campaign with more than $20.4 million in contributions. He supported 16 senatorial and congressional candidates, several of whom were proponents of the falsehood that there was significant voter fraud in the 2020 election. Two of said senatorial candidates (Blake Masters (who lost his race) and later U.S. Vice President JD Vance) were also tech investors who had previously worked for Thiel.

In 2023, Barton Gellman of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote in an article interviewing Thiel that Thiel &quot;has lost interest in democracy&quot; and that &quot;he wouldn’t be giving money to any politician, including Donald Trump, in the next presidential campaign&quot;. According to Reuters this occurred after he disagreed with the Republican party&#x27;s focus on cultural issues.

Thiel has his own political-action committee, Free Forever, which is committed to supporting political candidates who support stricter border control, restrictive immigration policy, funds for veterans, and anti-interventionist foreign policy, among other things. According to OpenSecrets the PAC was only active during the 2020 election cycle and only supported later Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach&#x27;s failed Senate bid (who lost in the primary election) and received almost all of its contributions from Thiel himself.

== Philanthropy ==
Thiel carries out most of his philanthropic activities through the Thiel Foundation.

===Research===
====Artificial intelligence====
In 2006, Thiel provided $100,000 of matching funds to back the Singularity Challenge donation drive of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (now known as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute), a nonprofit organization that promotes the development of friendly artificial intelligence. He provided half of the $400,000 matching funds for the 2007 donation drive, and as of 2013 the Thiel Foundation had donated over $1 million to the institute. Additionally, he has spoken at multiple Singularity Summits. At the 2009 Singularity Summit, he said his greatest concern is the technological singularity not arriving soon enough.

In December 2015, OpenAI announced that Thiel was one of their financial backers, a nonprofit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.

====Life extension====
In September 2006, Thiel announced that he would donate $3.5 million to foster anti-aging research through the non-profit Methuselah Mouse Prize foundation. He gave the following reasons for his pledge: &quot;Rapid advances in biological science foretell of a treasure trove of discoveries this century, including dramatically improved health and longevity for all. I&#x27;m backing Dr. [Aubrey] de Grey, because I believe that his revolutionary approach to aging research will accelerate this process, allowing many people alive today to enjoy radically longer and healthier lives for themselves and their loved ones.&quot; As of February 2017, he had donated over $7 million to the foundation.

When asked &quot;What is the biggest achievement that you haven&#x27;t achieved yet?&quot; by the moderator of a discussion panel at the Venture Alpha West 2014 conference, Thiel said he wants to make progress in anti-aging research. Thiel also said that he is registered to be cryonically preserved, meaning that he would be subject to low-temperature preservation in case of his legal death in hopes that he might be successfully revived by future medical technology, and is signed up with the Alcor Life Extension Foundation.

====Seasteading====
On 15 April 2008, Thiel pledged $500,000 to the newly created non-profit Seasteading Institute, directed by Patri Friedman, whose mission is &quot;to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems.&quot; At one of the institute&#x27;s conferences, he described seasteading as &quot;one of the few technological frontiers that has the promise to create a new space for human freedom.&quot; In 2011, Thiel gave $1.25 million to the Seasteading Institute, but resigned from its board the same year. In a 2017 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Thiel said seasteads are &quot;not quite feasible from an engineering perspective&quot; and &quot;still very far in the future&quot;.

===Thiel Fellowship===
On 29 September 2010, Thiel created the Thiel Fellowship, which annually awards $100,000 to 20 people under the age of 23 in order to spur them to drop out of college and create their own ventures. According to Thiel, for many young people, college is the path to take when they have no idea what to do with their lives:

===Breakout Labs===
In November 2011, the Thiel Foundation announced the creation of Breakout Labs, a grant-making program intended &quot;to fill the funding gap that exists for innovative research outside the confines of an academic institution, large corporation, or government.&quot; It offers grants of up to $350,000 to science-focused start-ups, &quot;with no strings attached&quot;. In April 2012, Breakout Labs announced its first set of grantees. In total, 12 startups received funding, for a total of $4.5 million in grants. One of the first ventures to receive funding from Breakout Labs was 3Scan, a tissue imaging platform.

===Other causes===
The Thiel Foundation is a supporter of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which promotes the right of journalists to report the news freely without fear of reprisal. Beginning in 2008, Thiel has donated over $1 million to the CPJ. He is also a supporter of the Human Rights Foundation, which organizes the Oslo Freedom Forum. In 2011 he was a featured speaker at the Oslo Freedom Forum, and the Thiel Foundation was one of the event&#x27;s main sponsors.

In 2011, Thiel made a NZ$1 million donation to an appeal fund for the casualties of the Christchurch earthquake.

==Personal life==
Thiel married his long-time partner Matt Danzeisen in October 2017, in Vienna, Austria. Danzeisen works as a portfolio manager at Thiel Capital. Thiel was also in a long-term relationship with Jeff Thomas, a social media influencer, from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic until Thomas&#x27;s sudden death in March 2023. He resides in San Francisco, California.

===Religious views===
Thiel is a self-described Christian and a promoter of René Girard&#x27;s Christian anthropology. He grew up in an evangelical household but, as of 2011, described his religious beliefs as &quot;somewhat heterodox&quot;, stating: &quot;I believe Christianity is true but I don&#x27;t sort of feel a compelling need to convince other people of that.&quot; Thiel has participated in Veritas Forum events with the noted theologian N. T. Wright discussing religion, politics, and technology.

During his time at Stanford University, Thiel attended a lecture given by René Girard. Girard, a Catholic, explained the role of sacrifice and the scapegoat mechanism in resolving social conflict, which appealed to Thiel as it offered a basis for his Christian faith without the fundamentalism of his parents.

===Chess===
Thiel began playing chess at the age of six and was at one time one of the top junior players in the United States. He holds the title of Life Master, but he has not competed since 2003. On 30 November 2016, Thiel made the ceremonial first move in the first tiebreak game of the World Chess Championship 2016 between Sergey Karjakin and Magnus Carlsen.

===Media appearances===
Thiel is an occasional commentator on CNBC, having appeared on both &quot;Closing Bell&quot; with Kelly Evans, and &quot;Squawk Box&quot; with Becky Quick. He has been interviewed twice by Charlie Rose on PBS. He has also contributed articles to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;First Things&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, and &quot;Policy Review&quot;, a journal formerly published by the Hoover Institution, on whose board he sits.

In &quot;The Social Network&quot;, Thiel was portrayed by Wallace Langham. He described the film as &quot;wrong on many levels&quot;.

Thiel was the inspiration for the Peter Gregory character on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. Thiel said of Gregory, &quot;I liked him... I think eccentric is always better than evil&quot;.

Jonas Lüscher stated in an interview with &quot;Basellandschaftliche Zeitung&quot; that he based the character Tobias Erkner in his novel &quot;Kraft&quot; (&quot;Force&quot;) on Thiel.

In a Post on Blue Sky in February 2025 Scott Benson stated that Peter, a vampire final boss of the action adventure minigame DemonTower in Night in the Woods was named after him.

===New Zealand citizenship===
Thiel was a German citizen by birth and became an American citizen by naturalization. He received New Zealand citizenship in a private ceremony at the New Zealand consulate in Santa Monica, California, in August 2011; his citizenship status was not made public until 2017. Thiel had visited the country on four occasions prior to his application for citizenship, staying a total of 12 days; the typical residency requirement is 1,350 days in five years. When he applied, Thiel stated he had no intention of living in New Zealand, which is a criterion for citizenship. Then-Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy waived those normal requirements, under an &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; clause of the Citizenship Act.

In 2015, Thiel purchased a estate near Wānaka, which fit the classification of &quot;sensitive land&quot; and required foreign buyers to obtain permission from New Zealand&#x27;s Overseas Investment Office. Thiel did not require permission, as he was a citizen.

Thiel&#x27;s application cited his contribution to the economy—he had founded a venture capital fund in Auckland before applying, and had invested $7 million in two local companies—as well as a $1 million donation to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake appeal fund. Rod Drury, founder of Xero, also provided a formal reference for Thiel&#x27;s application. Thiel&#x27;s case was cited by critics as an example of how New Zealand passports can be bought, something the New Zealand government denied. At the time that his citizenship was revealed, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; came out with the report that the New Zealand Defence Force, the Security Intelligence Service, and the Government Communications and Security Bureau have long-standing links with Thiel&#x27;s Palantir.

=== Roth IRA ===
In 2021, it was revealed by ProPublica that Thiel had purchased 1.7 million founder&#x27;s shares in the entity that would become PayPal using $1,700 in a Roth IRA in 1999. Due to the rapid growth in the value of the shares as PayPal grew and was later acquired by eBay, Thiel&#x27;s $1,700 investment grew to over $5 billion as of 2019. Most of this increase in the value of the Roth was due to him re-investing his PayPal proceeds into companies like Palantir and Facebook which grew quickly after his investment. Unlike a traditional IRA, in a Roth IRA, contributions are taxed initially, allowing for later tax-free withdrawal. As such, Thiel paid taxes on his initial $1,700 deposit, allowing him to potentially withdraw the $5 billion balance tax-free after age 59½.

===Awards and honors===
* In 2006, Thiel won the Herman Lay Award for Entrepreneurship.
* In 2007, he was honored as a Young Global leader by the World Economic Forum as one of the 250 most distinguished leaders age 40 and under.
* On 7 November 2009, Thiel was awarded an honorary degree from Guatemalan Universidad Francisco Marroquin.
* In 2012, Students For Liberty, an organization dedicated to spreading libertarian ideals on college campuses, awarded Thiel its &quot;Alumnus of the Year&quot; award.
* In February 2013, Thiel received a TechCrunch Crunchie Award for Venture Capitalist of the Year.

==Books==
===&quot;The Diversity Myth&quot;===
In 1995, the Independent Institute published &quot;The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and the Politics of Intolerance at Stanford&quot;, which Thiel co-authored along with fellow tech entrepreneur David O. Sacks, and with a foreword by the late Emory University historian Elizabeth Fox-Genovese. The book is critical of political correctness and multiculturalism in higher education and alleges that it has diluted academic rigor. Thiel and Sacks&#x27; writings drew criticism from then-Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice and then-Stanford President Gerhard Casper in describing Thiel and Sacks&#x27; view of Stanford as &quot;a cartoon, not a description of our freshman curriculum&quot;, and their commentary as &quot;demagoguery, pure and simple&quot;.

In 2016, Thiel apologized for two statements he made in the book: 1) &quot;The purpose of the rape crisis movement seems as much about vilifying men as about raising &#x27;awareness&#x27;&quot; and 2) &quot;But since a multicultural rape charge may indicate nothing more than belated regret, a woman might &#x27;realize&#x27; that she had been &#x27;raped&#x27; the next day or even many days later.&quot; He stated: &quot;More than two decades ago, I co-wrote a book with several insensitive, crudely argued statements. As I&#x27;ve said before, I wish I&#x27;d never written those things. I&#x27;m sorry for it. Rape in all forms is a crime. I regret writing passages that have been taken to suggest otherwise.&quot;

===&quot;Zero to One&quot;===
In spring 2012, Thiel taught the class CS 183: Startup at Stanford University. Notes for the course, taken by student Blake Masters, led to a book titled &quot;Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future&quot; by Thiel and Masters, which was released in September 2014. Thiel later endorsed Masters&#x27; campaign in the 2022 United States Senate election in Arizona, donating more than $10 million.

Derek Thompson, writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, stated &quot;Zero to One&quot; &quot;might be the best business book I&#x27;ve read&quot;. He described it as a &quot;self-help book for entrepreneurs, bursting with bromides&quot; but also as a &quot;lucid and profound articulation of capitalism and success in the 21st century economy.&quot;

===&quot;Tools of Titans&quot;===
Thiel also has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss&#x27; self-help book &quot;Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers&quot;.

<text>The Rothschilds is a musical with a book by Sherman Yellen, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick and music by Jerry Bock.

Based on &quot;The Rothschilds&quot; by Frederic Morton, it tells of the rise of the Rothschild family from humble beginnings in Germany, to their founding of their financial empire and growing political influence under the guidance of patriarch Mayer Rothschild, to their assistance in funding Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, and how they secure a declaration of rights for European Jews in the midst of an oppressive era.

&quot;The Rothschilds&quot; was the last collaboration between Bock and Harnick. The musical ran on Broadway in 1970, earning nine Tony Award nominations, and was revived successfully Off-Broadway in 1990. A 2015 reworking of the show was praised for clarifying the show and was recorded on JAY records.

==Productions==
In 1968, Derek Goldby was engaged as the show&#x27;s director. During out-of-town tryouts, he was replaced by Michael Kidd, which caused a disagreement between Bock and Harnick that ended their partnership.

After thirteen previews, the Broadway production, produced by Emanuel Azenberg and directed and choreographed by Kidd, opened on October 19, 1970, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, where it ran for 505 performances, closing on January 1, 1972. The cast included Hal Linden as Mayer Rothschild, Leila Martin as Gutele, Jill Clayburgh as Hannah Cohen, Keene Curtis in the multiple roles of the various national leaders doing business with the Rothschild family (Prince William of Hesse, Joseph Fouché, Herries, and Prince Metternich), Paul Hecht as Nathan Rothschild, Chris Sarandon as Jacob Rothschild, and Robby Benson as young Solomon Rothschild. Reid Shelton replaced Curtis later in the run. The show enjoyed a second production in San Francisco.

An Off-Broadway revival directed by Lonny Price and choreographed by Michael Arnold opened on February 10, 1990, at the American Jewish Theatre, where it ran for 435 performances. The cast included Mike Burstyn as Mayer, Leslie Ellis as Hannah, Allen Fitzpatrick in the multiple roles of Prince William of Hesse, Joseph Fouché, Herries, and Prince Metternich, Robert Cuccioli as Nathan, and David Cantor as Amshel.

==Synopsis==
In 1772 Frankfurt, Germany, Jews are restricted to living in the ghetto and frequently are the victims of violence (“Pleasure and Privilege”). Mayer Amschel Rothschild returns from Hanover, where he was an apprentice banker, to make his fortune in his home town. Because only twelve Jewish marriages are permitted in a given year, he is forced to come up with a plan in order to marry his fiancée Gutele (“One Room”). He reopens his shop, carrying goods and rare coins. At the Frankfurt Fair, he entices Prince William of Hesse with fanciful tales about rare coins (“He Tossed A Coin”), then bribes the prince in order to marry Gutele. Later, Mayer becomes agent for the court bankers, but he wants more.

By 1778, Mayer and Gutele have five sons (“Sons”), each of whom enters the business as soon as he is old enough. As they age, they and their father chafe at the many restrictions and indignities heaped upon Jews (“Everything”). In 1804, their success and their chutzpah take them to Denmark as superior court agents to the Danish king when Hesse must loan money to him to help fight a war (“Rothschilds and Sons”). However, Hesse is overthrown by Napoleon, and Minister of Police Joseph Fouché takes over (“Allons”). When Mayer and his sons return to Germany, they find no court for which they can be agents. Mayer sends his older sons off to collect Hesse&#x27;s debts before the French can get them, and sends his younger son, Nathan, to London to invest the money (“Sons&quot; (reprise)).

Initially awkward in England, Nathan soon displays considerable investing talents (“This Amazing London Town”). He falls in love with Hannah Cohen, an aristocratic English &quot;Jewish Joan of Arc&quot; devoted to charitable works (“I’m in Love! I’m in Love!”). He eventually wins her over by pledging to loan money to England to help win their war against Napoleon if the Chancellor of the Exchequer Herries pledges to make Germany and Austria lift their restrictions on Jews. In Germany, Prince Metternich promises roughly the same thing if the Rothschilds make the loan (“Have You Ever Seen a Prettier Congress”). In 1818, Metternich reneges on his bargain, and old Mayer dies, broken-hearted (“In My Lifetime”). His sons scheme to force Metternich to come to terms by continually undercutting his price for peace bonds, although the plan brings them to the brink of bankruptcy (“Bonds”). Metternich not only concedes but is forced to guarantee that all state bonds will be handled by the House of Rothschild. The ghetto walls are torn down, and Mayer&#x27;s dream is realized.

==Adaptation: &quot;Rothschild &amp; Sons&quot;==
In 2015, Harnick and Yellen revised the musical as &quot;Rothschild &amp; Sons&quot;, greatly restructuring the book as a one-act show and adding previously written but unheard Harnick and Bock songs. The story focuses on Mayer Rothschild&#x27;s relationships with his sons. It was produced off-Broadway by York Theatre at the Theater at St. Peter&#x27;s from October to November 2015 and directed by Jeffrey B. Moss. Robert Cuccioli, who played Nathan Rothschild in the 1990 production, played Mayer, Glory Crampton was Gutele. The production received mixed notices. Musical Theatre Review wrote that &quot;Harnick has also written a host of clear, concise lyrics that help further the plot, and the storytelling is further enhanced by Moss’ fluid staging and a host of fine performances, especially the powerful portrayal of Mayer by Robert Cuccioli.&quot; Elyse Sommer, writing in CurtainUp, opined that &quot;&quot;Rothschild &amp; Sons&quot; does indeed offer a refreshing new look at this show&#x27;s best features: its many sparkling period flavored songs with their narrative pushing lyrics, and the smart compression of that narrative.&quot; Victor Gluck called the production &quot;engrossing and admirable,&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;rich new production&quot;, noting the &quot;splendid 18th-century men’s costumes by Carrie Robbins, low-key yet opulent scenic design (palaces versus the Frankfurt ghetto) by James Morgan [and] assertively nuanced lighting by Kirk Bookman.&quot; The show was recorded on JAY Records and filmed for the archive at Lincoln Center.

<text>Jean Antoine de Baïf (; 19 February 1532 – 19 September 1589) was a French poet and member of the &quot;Pléiade&quot;.

==Life==

Jean Antoine de Baïf was born in Venice, the natural son of the scholar Lazare de Baïf, who was at that time French ambassador at Venice. Thanks, perhaps, to the surroundings of his childhood, he grew up an enthusiast for the fine arts, and surpassed in zeal all the leaders of the Renaissance in France. His father spared no pains to secure the best possible education for his son. The boy was taught Latin by Charles Estienne, and Greek by Ange Vergèce, the Cretan scholar and calligraphist who designed Greek types for Francis I.

When he was eleven years old he was put under the care of the famous Jean Daurat. Ronsard, who was eight years his senior, now began to share his studies. Claude Binet tells how young Baïf, bred on Latin and Greek, smoothed out the tiresome beginnings of the Greek language for Ronsard, who in return initiated his companion into the mysteries of French versification.

Baïf possessed an extraordinary facility, and the mass of his work has injured his reputation. Besides a number of volumes of short poems of an amorous or congratulatory kind, he translated or paraphrased various pieces from Bion of Smyrna, Moschus, Theocritus, Anacreon, Catullus and Martial. He resided in Paris, and enjoyed the continued favor of the court. In 1570, in conjunction with the composer Joachim Thibault de Courville, with royal blessing and financial backing, he founded the Académie de Poésie et de Musique, with the idea of establishing a closer union between music and poetry; his house became famous for the concerts which he gave, entertainments which Charles IX and Henry III frequently attended. Composers such as Claude Le Jeune, who was to become the most influential musician in France in the late 16th century, and Jacques Mauduit, who carried the Academie&#x27;s ideas into the 17th century, soon joined the group, which remained secretive as to its intents and techniques.

==Works==

Baïf elaborated a system for regulating French versification by quantity, a system which came to be known as &quot;vers mesurés&quot;, or &quot;vers mesurés à l&#x27;antique&quot;. In the general idea of regulating versification by quantity, he was not a pioneer. Jacques de la Taille had written in 1562 the &quot;Maniére de faire des vers en français comme en grec et en Latin&quot; (printed 1573), and other poets had made experiments in the same direction; however, in his specific attempt to recapture the ancient Greek and Latin ethical effect of poetry on its hearers, and in applying the metrical innovations to music, he created something entirely new.

Baïf&#x27;s innovations also included a line of 15 syllables known as the &quot;vers Baïfin&quot;. He also meditated reforms in French spelling.

His theories are exemplified in &quot;Etrenes de poezie Franzoeze an vers mezures&quot; (1574). His works were published in 4 volumes, entitled &quot;Œuvres en rime&quot; (1573), consisting of &quot;Amours, Jeux, Passetemps, et Poemes&quot;, containing, among much that is now hardly readable, some pieces of infinite grace and delicacy. His sonnet on the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot; was said to contain the whole argument of that celebrated work, and Colletet says it was on everybody&#x27;s lips. He held the historian of the French language Claude Fauchet in high regard; in a neo-Latin poem addressed to Fauchet, Baïf called him &#x27;Falcete docte, carminum ô tu candide / Iudex meorum&#x27; (&#x27;Learned Fauchet, candid judge of my poems&#x27;).

He also wrote a celebrated sonnet in praise of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre. Baïf was the author of two comedies, &quot;L&#x27;Eunuque&quot;, 1565 (published 1573), a free translation of Terence&#x27;s &quot;Eunuchus&quot;, and &quot;Le Brave&quot; (1567), an imitation of the &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot;, in which the characters of Plautus are turned into Frenchmen, the action taking place at Orléans. Baïf published a collection of Latin verse in 1577, and in 1576 a popular volume of &quot;Mimes, enseignemens et proverbes&quot;.

Twentieth century French composer Denise Roger used Baïf&#x27;s text in some of her songs.

<text>The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 37) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland that established a system of local government in Ireland similar to that already created for England, Wales and Scotland by legislation in 1888 and 1889. The Act effectively ended landlord control of local government in Ireland.

==Background==
From the 1880s the issue of local government reform in Ireland was a major political issue, involving both Irish politicians and the major British political parties. Questions of constitutional reform, land ownership and nationalism all combined to complicate matters, as did splits in both the Liberal Party in 1886 and the Irish Parliamentary Party in 1891. Eventually, the Conservative government of Lord Salisbury found it politically expedient to introduce the measures in 1898.

The legislation was seen by the government as solving a number of problems: it softened demands for home rule from Nationalists, it eased the burden of agricultural rates on Unionist landlords, it created a more efficient poor law administration and it strengthened the Union by bringing English forms of local government to Ireland.

==The existing system and earlier attempts at reform==

===Counties and baronies===
Each county and county corporate of Ireland was administered before the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 by a grand jury. These bodies were made up of major landowners appointed by the assizes judge of the county. As well as their original judicial functions the grand juries had taken on the maintenance of roads, bridges and asylums and the supervision of other public works. The grand jury made proposals for expenditure known as &quot;presentments&quot; which required the approval of the assizes judge. The money to pay for the presentments was raised by a &quot;county cess&quot; levied on landowners and occupiers in the county, a form of rate tax. A second tier of administrative division below the county was the barony. A similar system operated at this level, with the justices of the area empowered to meet in baronial presentment sessions to raise a cess to fund minor works.

By 1880 the members of the grand juries and baronial sessions were still overwhelmingly Unionist and Protestant, and therefore totally unrepresentative of the majority of the population of the areas they governed. This was because they had represented and were chosen from the actual taxpayers since the Middle Ages, and retiring members were normally replaced by similar taxpayers from the same social class. The understanding was that larger taxpayers had a greater motive to see that the tax money was spent properly. The Representation of the People Act 1884 created a much larger electorate that had very different needs and inevitably wanted to elect local representatives from outside a narrow social élite. By now public works such as roads and bridges were being funded increasingly by central government via the Office of Public Works.

===Poor law unions and sanitary districts===
In 1838 Ireland was divided into poor law unions (PLUs), each consisting of a geographical area based on a workhouse. The union boundaries did not correspond to those of any existing unit, with many rural areas crossing into two or more counties. The unions were administered by boards of guardians. The boards were in part directly elected, with one guardian elected for each electoral division.

With the growth of population a need to create authorities to administer public health and provide or regulate such services as sewerage, paving and water supply arose. The Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878 created sanitary districts, based on the system already existing in England and Wales. Larger towns (municipal boroughs and towns with commissioners under private acts or with a population of 6,000 or more) were created urban sanitary districts: the existing local council became the urban sanitary authority. The remainder of the country was divided into rural sanitary districts. These were identical in area to poor law unions (less any part in an urban sanitary district), and the rural sanitary authority consisted of the poor law guardians for the area.

===Proposed changes 1888–1892===
The first proposals for elected county councils in Ireland were made by the Radical-Liberal Minister Joseph Chamberlain to Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone in 1885. The electorate had been enlarged by the recent Representation of the People Act 1884. Gladstone and Charles Stewart Parnell, leader of the Irish National League, preferred to legislate for Irish Home Rule. However, the First Home Rule Bill was defeated in the House of Commons in 1886. Chamberlain, briefly the President of the Local Government Board in 1886, then left the Liberals to form the Liberal Unionist Party and brought the proposal to his new Conservative allies, who won the 1886 United Kingdom general election shortly afterwards.

In 1888 Chamberlain again called for democratically elected county councils in Ireland, as a part of a crash programme of state-funded public works, in his book &quot;A Unionist Policy for Ireland&quot;.

Directly elected county councils were introduced to England and Wales by the Local Government Act 1888 and to Scotland by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. Attempts to bring about similar reforms in Ireland were delayed because of the civil unrest caused by the Plan of Campaign. The government argued that before they could bring in administrative reforms, law and order should be restored. Accordingly, Arthur Balfour, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, introduced coercion acts to end the &quot;agrarian outrages&quot;. Unionists, increasingly losing seats to members of the Irish National League at elections of guardians, also sought to delay implementation.

Balfour announced on 10 August 1891 that local government legislation would be introduced in the next parliamentary session. The announcement was met with protests from Unionists and landlords who predicted that the new authorities would be disloyal and would monopolise their power to drive them out of the country. Balfour, despite the opposition, made it clear that he intended to proceed. With the Irish Parliamentary Party split into &quot;Parnellite&quot; and &quot;anti-Parnellite&quot; factions, he was encouraged to believe that the bill could be used to destroy the demand for Home Rule and further splinter the Nationalist movement.

When the bill was introduced to Parliament early in 1892, it was clear that the Unionists had successfully watered down many of its provisions by securing safeguards on their hold on local government. The provisions of the proposed legislation were:
*County and district councils, elected on the parliamentary franchise
*Transfer of powers of grand juries over roads and sanitation to the new councils
*Administration of local revenues and setting of county cess to be decided by the majority of ratepayers
The &quot;safeguards&quot; to protect the Unionist minority were:
*Electors to have &quot;cumulative votes&quot; with those paying more cess having more votes
*Any ratepayer could challenge the council presentment before a judge and jury
*County and district councils could be dismissed for &quot;disobedience to the law, corruption or consistent malversion and oppression&quot;
*A joint committee of councillors and grand jurors was to approve all capital expenditure and appointment of officers.

The bill was rejected by almost all Irish parliamentarians, with the support of only a handful of Ulster Liberal Unionists. While Balfour hoped to make the legislation acceptable by tabling amendments, this was rejected by Nationalists who hoped to see a change to a pro-Home Rule Liberal administration at the imminent general election. The bill was accordingly abandoned.

==Gerald Balfour as Chief Secretary and the crisis of 1897==
Following three years of Liberal government, the Conservative–Liberal Unionist coalition formed a Unionist government following the 1895 general election. Gerald Balfour, brother of Arthur, and nephew of the new Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland on 4 July 1895. He soon made his mark when he summarised the Irish policy of the new government as &quot;killing home rule with kindness&quot;. The British Government passed three major pieces of Irish legislation in four years: apart from the Local Government Act, these were the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1896 (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. 47) and the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act 1899.

The local government legislation was not originally part of the government&#x27;s programme announced in the Queen&#x27;s Speech of January 1897. It was also exceptional in that there was almost no popular demand for the reforms. It thus came as a complete surprise when Chief Secretary Balfour announced in May that he was preparing legislation. While he claimed that the extension to Ireland of the local government reforms already carried out in Great Britain had always been intended, the sudden conversion to the &quot;alternative policy&quot; was in fact a way of solving a political crisis at Westminster. Obstruction by Irish members of parliament and a number of English MPs was causing a legislative backlog. Landlords, already angered by the 1896 Land Act, were enraged by the refusal of the Treasury to extend the agricultural rating grant to Ireland. In fact, the failure to introduce the grant was largely due to there being no effective local government system to administer it. Instead, an equivalent sum had been given to the Dublin Castle administration, who had decided to use the money to fund poor law reform and a new Agricultural Board. On 18 May the Irish Unionist MPs wrote to the government informing them that they would withdraw their support unless the rating grant was introduced.

The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Cadogan, held talks with the Treasury and hit upon the idea of introducing the local government reforms as a way to &quot;break up a combination of unionists with nationalists in Ireland&quot; which he felt was &quot;becoming too strong for even for a ministry with a majority of 150!&quot; The introduction of democratic county councils along with a substantial rates subsidy was felt to be sure to placate all Irish members of the house. The government moved quickly, sending a copy of the English Local Government Act of 1888 to Sir Henry Robinson, vice-president of the Local Government Board for Ireland. Robinson, who was on holiday, was instructed to decide how much of the existing legislation could be speedily adapted for Irish use. Within a week came the announcement that a bill was to be prepared.

There would not be enough time in a single parliamentary session to debate all planned measures, so an omnibus power was granted to Lord Lieutenant to pass Orders in Council adapting previous acts to Ireland, including parts of the (English) Municipal Corporations Acts 1882 and 1893 and Local Government Acts 1888 and 1894, and the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. This use of secondary legislation rather than primary legislation was controversial, but Irish nationalists accepted it as the price of getting the bill passed.

==The reforms==
The 1898 Act brought in a mixed system of government, with county boroughs independent of county administration, and elsewhere a two-tier system with county councils, along with borough, urban and rural district councils. Urban districts were created from the larger of the town commissioners towns, while the smaller towns retained their town commissioners, but remained in the rural districts for sanitary planning purposes.

The creation of the new councils had a significant effect on Ireland as it allowed a much larger number of local people to take decisions affecting themselves. The county and the sub-county District Councils created a political platform for proponents of Home Rule, displacing Unionist influence in many areas. The enfranchisement of local electors allowed the development of a new political class, creating a significant body of experienced politicians who would enter national politics in Ireland in the 1920s, and increase the stability of the transitions to the parliaments of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.

==County and county borough boundaries==
The Act led to the modification of a number of county boundaries. This was for several reasons:
* Each county district had to be in a single county, unlike the sanitary districts on which they were based
** Where an urban sanitary district lay in more than one county, the new urban district would be placed entirely within that in which the majority of the population lay.
** Where a poor law union (PLU) lay in more than one county, generally a rural district was created for the fraction each county (for example, Ballyshannon PLU was split into Ballyshannon No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 rural districts in counties Donegal, Fermanagh, and Leitrim respectively). Boundaries were adjusted if one fraction was too small or otherwise impractical.
* The eight old counties corporate did not correspond to the six new county boroughs.
** The cities of Belfast and Derry were separated from the counties in which they lay and constituted as separate county boroughs. 
** Four counties corporate were merged into their parent counties.

The extents of the new administrative counties and county boroughs, which came into effect on 18 April 1899, were defined by orders of the Local Government Board for Ireland. There were no changes to the boundaries of the counties of Cavan, Cork, Donegal, Fermanagh, Kerry, Kildare, King&#x27;s County (now Offaly), Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Meath, Monaghan, and Tyrone; nor to those of the county boroughs (previously counties corporate) of Cork, Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford. Changes elsewhere were as follows:
;Notes:
==Subsequent amendments and repeals==

Boundaries of Irish county constituencies at Westminster were not adjusted by the 1898 Act to align with the new administrative boundaries. Some were aligned by the Representation of the People Act 1918, where the county divisions were being altered for other reasons; for example Kilculliheen was transferred from Waterford City to South Kilkenny, but Ardnaree remained in North Sligo rather than East Mayo.

Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1919, the electoral system for local elections in Ireland was changed to single transferable vote (STV) in multi-member districts. This had been used in the election to Sligo Corporation in 1919 (provided under separate local legislation), and then for the 1920 Irish local elections. After the partition of Ireland in 1920–22, the situation evolved differently in the Irish Free State (Ireland from 1937, Republic of Ireland from 1949) and Northern Ireland.

In the Irish Free State, rural districts were abolished by the Local Government Act 1925 (they remained in County Dublin until abolished under the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930). Urban districts were renamed &quot;towns&quot; by the Local Government Act 2001. The 2001 Act also renamed &quot;county borough corporations&quot; as &quot;city councils&quot;. The introduction of a council–manager system in 1929–40 significantly changed the operation of county and city councils. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 abolished the tier of boroughs and towns within county areas and divided all counties (except those in County Dublin) into municipal districts.

8, 29, 52, 54, 69(1)–(2), 80, 89, 101(2), 101(4), 102(1)–(3), 109, 110(1), 110(2)(a), and 124, and Schedule 1 parts 3 and 4. 

In Northern Ireland, STV was abolished in 1922. The two-tier county–district system was retained until the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 replaced it with a system of 26 unitary districts from 1973. Some elected councils had been dissolved in the 1960s as tensions grew in the buildup to the Troubles. the unrepealed sections of the 1898 act in Northern Ireland were 4, 10, 11, 21, 27, 29, 31, 36, 37, 41, 69, 72, 78, 82, 83, 108–110, and 124.

<text>The Vermillion River is a tributary of the Missouri River, 96 miles (154 km) long, in eastern South Dakota in the United States. The origin of the river name is , Lakota for &quot;place where vermilion is obtained&quot;.

It is formed by the confluence of the East Fork Vermillion River and West Fork Vermillion River. The East Fork, approximately long, rises in Lake Whitewood in Kingsbury County on the Coteau des Prairies. The West Fork, approximately long, rises in Miner County. Both forks flow south, roughly parallel, joining east of Parker. The combined river flows south and joins the Missouri east of the James River Highlands and south of Vermillion. Its tributaries include White Stone Creek and Baptist Creek. The Vermillion River drains about of the southwestern edge of the Coteau des Prairies. Approximately once per 3.5 years, the Vermillion runs dry.

The Vermillion is a north-south river situated between the Big Sioux River and James River.

<doc id="610543" wikidata="Q6303223" url="?curid=610543" title="Investment in post-invasion Iraq">
<text>Investment in post-2003 [[Iraq]] refers to international efforts to rebuild the infrastructure of Iraq since the Iraq War in 2003. Along with the economic reform of Iraq, international projects have been implemented to repair and upgrade Iraqi water and sewage treatment plants, electricity production, hospitals, schools, housing, and transportation systems. Much of the work has been funded by the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, and the Coalition Provisional Authority.

A significant event for aid or investment in post-2003 Iraq was the Madrid Conference on Reconstruction on 23 October 2003, which was attended by representatives from over 25 nations. Funds assembled at this conference and from other sources have been administered by the United Nations and the World Bank under the umbrella of the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq.

While reconstruction efforts have produced some successes, problems have arisen with the implementation of internationally funded Iraq reconstruction efforts. These include inadequate security, pervasive corruption, insufficient funding and poor coordination among international agencies and local communities. Many suggest that the efforts were hampered by a poor understanding of Iraq on the part of the international community assisting with the reconstruction.

==Pre-2003 status of Iraq infrastructure==

During the 1970s Iraq made extensive investment in the water sector and other infrastructure using the proceeds of oil revenue. This investment slowed during the Iran-Iraq War of 1980 to 1988, but left Iraq in 1990 with a relatively modern electrical, water supply and sewerage system. During the Gulf War of 1991 aerial bombardment caused severe damage to the electric grid that operated the pumping stations and other facilities for potable water delivery and sewage treatment. The sanctions imposed by the UN at the conclusion of the Gulf War exacerbated these problems by banning the importation of spare parts for equipment and chemicals, such as chlorine, needed for disinfection. As a result of the war and sanctions, delivery of water dropped precipitously. For example, UNICEF estimates that before 1991, 95% of urban dwellers and 75% of rural dwellers were served by modern water supply systems that delivered treated water to homes and businesses. By 1999, urban coverage had dropped to 92% and rural coverage to 46%. Individual water availability showed greater changes. Between 1990 and 2000, the daily per capita share of potable water went from 330 litres to 150 litres in Baghdad, 270 to 110 in other urban areas, and 180 to 65 in rural areas.

The March 2003 invasion of Iraq produced further degradation of Iraq&#x27;s water supply, sewerage and electrical supply systems. Treatment plants, pumping stations and generating stations were stripped of their equipment, supplies and electrical wiring by looters. The once-capable cadre of engineers and operating technicians were scattered or left the country. Reconstruction efforts faced a nation with a severely degraded infrastructure.

==Assessing reconstruction needs==
In preparation for the October 2003 Madrid Donor Conference, the joint United Nations/World Bank team conducted an assessment of funding needs for reconstruction in Iraq during the period 2004-2007. The resulting report identified 14 sectors and associated funding needs as shown in the Table below. In addition to this US$36 billion, the Coalition Provisional Authority estimated an additional US$20 billion in need including US$5 billion for security and police and US$8 billion for oil industry infrastructure.

In 2007 the Government of Iraq and the United Nations created the International Compact with Iraq a visioning and planning entity which identified reconstruction as an essential element for meeting human needs and economic development.

==Administration of Iraq reconstruction==
Funds for Iraq reconstruction are disbursed to Iraqi ministries, non-Iraqi government agencies and various non-governmental groups. These entities then supervise the acquisition of materials and reconstruction work which is conducted by both foreign and Iraqi contractors.

Funds held by the United Nations Development Group are disbursed through United Nations agencies such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the UN Development Program. These UN agencies directly contract with equipment suppliers and construction companies. Disbursement of funds by the UN began in June 2004. Funds held by the World Bank are disbursed directly to Iraqi government agencies including the Municipality of Baghdad and national ministries. Granting of funds to Iraqi agencies began in December 2004.

A series of US agencies have managed funds held by the US-operated Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. Beginning in May 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began oversight of reconstruction efforts in Iraq. Within the CPA the Project Management Office (PMO) was created to manage reconstruction projects. Both the CPA and PMO were divisions of the US Department of Defense. On June 28, 2004, the CPA was dissolved and the Iraqi interim government took power. At this time, the management of reconstruction projects was transferred to the Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office (IRMO), a division of the US Department of State, and the Project and Contracting Office (PCO), a division of the Department of Defense, both under the oversight of the US State Department Mission to Baghdad. On December 4, 2005 the PCO was merged with the US Army Corps of Engineers, Gulf Region Division. Since October 2004, contracting support for Iraq reconstruction has also been provided by the Joint Contracting Command-Iraq/Afghanistan. Other U.S. Government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State Department, have also issued contracts funded by the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.

Funds from the US-operated IRRF are largely disbursed through contracts to private firms. Several US companies have been particularly prominent in receiving Iraq reconstruction funds. Bechtel of San Francisco, USA has been awarded over $2.4 billion for infrastructure rehabilitation through USAID contracts. Flour AMEC, LLC, Greenville, South Carolina, USA has been awarded nearly $1 billion for water, sewer of solid waste management systems. Parsons Corporation of Pasadena, California has been awarded $1.3 billion for construction services. Washington Group International of Boise, Idaho, USA has received awards of $580 million for water resource reconstruction projects. Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR), a subsidiary of Halliburton of Houston, Texas has received awards of $580 million. Another $1.2 billion has been distributed to Iraqi contractors. In 2005/2006 Symbion Power of the US were awarded $250 million of competitively bid new fixed price electrical infrastructure work throughout the country. Symbion Power is a privately owned engineering firm with an ownership structure that involves a security company Hart Security. The dollar figures provided here are as of July 2006.

==Progress of Iraq reconstruction==
Reconstruction efforts have been plagued by poor management, mishandling of reconstruction funds, inadequate coordination with Iraqis and widespread attacks on construction sites and contractors as documented by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR).&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 12/14/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In October, 2004, the U.S. Congress created SIGIR which is charged with oversight of the use and potential misuse of the IRRF. The SIGIR conducts audits, investigations and inspections and issues quarterly reports to Congress. The SIGIR reports and U.S. Congressional testimony of Stuart Bowen, the Inspector General, are a primary source of information on U.S. funded Iraq reconstruction&#x27;s overall status. The rate of disbursement of funds administered by the United Nations and World Bank has been slow. Iraqi agencies and ministries are often unable to receive or process funds. Many United Nations agencies have had great difficulty operating in Iraq due to the poor security situation.

===Reprogramming reconstruction funds===
The original allocation of IRRF funds to the various sectors has undergone a series of reassignments. These allocation changes have occurred in September and December, 2004 and March and December, 2005 and generally involved shifting money from water resources and sanitation and electricity sectors to meet security needs and to provide training and operating funds for facilities already rehabilitated under IRRF funding. The table below shows the changes that occurred in allocations (billions of $US) between September 2004 and December 2005. While the administrative expenses are listed as separate category, an additional $0.60 billion, spread across sectors, was spent on administrative costs in fiscal years 2004 and 2005.

===Reconstruction gap===
In October, 2005 the SIGIR introduced the concept of the &quot;reconstruction gap&quot; which was defined as the difference between the reconstruction planned and that which is actually delivered. As of February 2006, the SIGIR reported that only 36% of water sector projects originally planned will be completed and only 70% of the originally-planned electricity sector projects will be completed. This shortfall is attributed to IRRF reprogramming of funds from these sectors to meet security needs, poor cost estimates in the original reconstruction plan, increased material costs and lack of administrative oversight. Estimates of the funds required to close the reconstruction gap are difficult to obtain because there is inadequate information on the cost-to-complete projects already in progress. In addition to funds for reconstruction, SIGIR recommends that funds be allocated to sustain the reconstructed infrastructure. Without funding for supplies, technicians and fuel, the facilities that have been completed may fall into disuse.

===Security of international aid workers===
International NGOs (INGOs) have found operating in Iraq highly dangerous to their staff, as between March 2003 and March 2008 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted. This has led to INGOs to either completely unwind their operations, or else go undercover and try to make their activities as low profile as possible. INGOs are not treated as neutral parties by large sections of the population due to their beginning operations alongside the invasion and receiving security and funding from the multinational force and the governments that it consists of. The security situation has also led to much of the management of aid programmes to take place abroad, thus lowering the effectiveness of the programmes and creating a fragmented response. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have discussed the importance of using local organisations and also understanding the violence not a single insurmountable challenge, but understanding various acts of violence more individually, sharing the knowledge between agencies and responding more appropriately - the formation of the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq is a step in this direction.

===Attacks on construction activities===
Attacks, murders, bombings and armed vandalism are routine threats to reconstruction contractors. Since reconstruction began in March 2003 and as of July 30, 2009, at least 1395 workers on U.S. funded projects have died according to the U.S. Departments of Labor and State. The table below shows the number of worker deaths in each quarter starting with the first reporting by SIGIR. In addition, there have been thousands of insurance claims by construction workers for injuries sustained in attacks. The figures are probably mis-reported, especially among Iraqi contractors. Intimidation of workers has delayed projects and reduced the availability of non-Iraqi expert technicians. It is estimated that 25% of reconstruction funds have been used to provide security to construction workers and job sites.

Attacks and vandalism have also affected completed projects including sabotage of oil pipelines and high-voltage electricity towers. However, the Commander of the Multi-National Force-Iraq, General David Petraeus, announced in May, 2008 that oil and electricity production have exceeded pre-war levels as the &quot;surge&quot; and enlistment of local Iraqis in security forces has brought calm to many areas of the nation.

===Corruption===
It has been alleged that large amounts of American tax dollars and seized Iraqi revenues were lost by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). One audit put the total number as high as $8.8 billion. Fraudulent contractors such as Philip Bloom often bribed CPA officials in exchange for contracts that were never performed.
An article in the &quot;New York Times&quot; describes &quot;irregularities including millions of reconstruction dollars stuffed casually into footlockers and filing cabinets, an American soldier in the Philippines who gambled away cash belonging to Iraq, and three Iraqis who plunged to their deaths in a rebuilt hospital elevator that had been improperly certified as safe.&quot; While the US government has begun the process of prosecuting contractors that stole American tax dollars, the Iraqi government currently has no means of reacquiring Iraqi assets that were stolen by US contractors. This is partially due to a decree passed by the CPA that gives civilian contractors in Iraq immunity from all Iraqi jurisdiction.

As part of reconstruction, no-bid contracts have been awarded to large American corporations including Halliburton and Bechtel. In particular, Halliburton has been singled out for receiving what is perceived to be government favoritism for doing a shoddy job of rebuilding Iraq&#x27;s oil infrastructure. When the Pentagon&#x27;s own auditors determined that about $263 million of a Halliburton subsidiary&#x27;s costs were potentially excessive, the Army still paid the company all but $10.1 million of the disputed costs.
Bechtel Corp. became the first major U.S. contractor to announce that it was pulling out of Iraq in Fall 2006.

Some say that the reconstruction would have been both much more efficient and inexpensive if more contracts were granted to local Iraqi firms, many of whom were shut out of the process due to the fact that they were state-owned. Congressman Henry Waxman was once told by members of the Iraqi governing council that paying Iraqi companies to rebuild Iraq instead of American ones would save American tax payers 90% of the costs.

By Summer of 2008, oil and electricity levels returned to pre-invasion (i.e. pre-March, 2003) levels.

In 2012 the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported that in the prior two years 70 American individuals and companies had won up to USD8 billion in contracts for post-war Iraq and Afghanistan, all of which donated to the successful presidential campaigns of US former president George W. Bush and were led by Dick Cheney before he was picked as Bush&#x27;s running mate and subsequently elected vice president.

There have also been reports of pressure from the US government on the Iraqi administration regarding the latter&#x27;s public procurement bids. In April 2019 German conglomerate Siemens was on the verge to win a USD 14 billion contract to rebuild Iraq&#x27;s war-damaged infrastructure, according to then prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, which reportedly angered Siemens rival, American conglomerate General Electric and caused the Trump administration to lobby for GE. Additionally in 2018 Iraqi officials said the Trump administration had been heavily pressuring the country to pick GE over Siemens which eventually happened later that year. 

==Current status of reconstruction==
The United States Special Inspector General along with many Iraqi leaders judged the program to be a failure.

===Electricity===
General Petraeus noted in May, 2008 that electricity levels have exceeded pre-war production; however, this statistic is misleading. The estimated hours per day of electricity availability has shifted. During the Saddam rule, Baghdad received electricity for between 16 and 24 hours per day with 4 to 8 hours received outside of the capital. Information from the Brookings Institution (early 2007) indicates that Baghdad now receives electricity from 4 to 8 hours per day with the remainder of the nation receiving from 8 to 12 hours of electricity per day. Current electricity levels of about 4000 MW have not yet reached the stated goal of nationwide production of 6000 MW.

Much of the efforts to rebuild Iraq&#x27;s electrical infrastructure has been largely dependent on the repair and construction of transmission lines and substations by global engineering firms willing to work in hostile territories.

As of September 2013, the electricity ministry said approaching self-sufficiency and this year will mark the end of the crisis, and that hours in Baghdad and other provinces ranged from 24 hours during these days, as are eight provinces with 24 hours of electricity are Kirkuk and Babil, Najaf, Karbala, Missan, Thiqar and Muthana, along with exception of Kadhimiya.

===Food and humanitarian aid===
In relation to food and humanitarian aid, Iraq seems to have underscored in different ways. The Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (OHRA) was for example, established with the aim of restoring the basic services with in the Iraqi people. Very little has been achieved however, in relation to the socio-economic rehabilitation. Iraqi people have sustained much more suffering prior to the invasion.

In May 2006, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) concluded its most recent food security survey.

It found that 15 percent of the total Iraqi population (just over 4 million people) is food insecure and in dire need of different types of humanitarian assistance, including food, despite the rations they are receiving from the Public Distribution System (PDS). This is an increase from the estimated 11 percent (2.6 million people) deemed to be extremely poor in WFP&#x27;s first survey in September 2004. The May 2006 survey also indicated that a further 8.3 million people would be rendered food insecure if they were not provided with a PDS ration, compared to 3.6 million people in the previous survey. An earlier survey, conducted in July 2005, found that acute malnutrition rates for children was nine percent overall, but with rates for children between 6 and 12 months old reaching 13 percent and 12 percent for those aged between one and two years.

In 2007, the WFP continues to provide emergency food provisions to about 1.1 million Iraqis. WFP has assisted in the establishment of a Food Security Unit, located in the Iraq Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation, which collects food security information. The PDS is still a major contributor in stabilizing the food supply in Iraq. For the poor and food insecure, the PDS represents by far the single most important food source in their diet.

===Water, sanitation and solid waste===
As of January 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;SIGIR 1/07&quot;&gt;SIGIR Report to Congress January 30, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt; IRRF funded projects have resulted in the construction or rehabilitation of 21 potable water treatment facilities and 200 smaller water systems. Major projects include the Nassriya Water Treatment Plant which will produce 240,000 cubic meters per day. A new water canal to supply clean water to Basrah and Thi Qar was completed in April 2006. These projects have provided capacity to supply water to approximately 5.4 million people (1.67 million cubic meters per day). This compares with the target capacity, at the completion of all IRRF funded water projects, of 2.37 million cubic meters per day needed to provide for 8.4 million people. The water that actually reaches Iraqi citizens is difficult to determine because of significant water losses in the distribution systems.

A modern landfill, built to international environmental standards, is planned for southwest Baghdad, with the capacity to handle 2,230 cubic meters of waste per day. The construction was halted prior to completion in November 2005, due to security concerns. There has been some limited utilization of the landfill, however full utilization has not yet been implemented.

Recent reports on waste collection, note that being a garbage collector may be one of the most dangerous jobs in Iraq. Most of the 500 municipal workers who have been killed in Baghdad since 2005 have been waste collectors. There are inadequate waste collection vehicles with only 380 presently in service. Before the invasion there were 1200 working trucks. Most of the vehicles were destroyed or lost in the looting that seized the capital after the American invasion. The deputy mayor of Baghdad estimates the city needs 1,500 waste collection vehicles.

===Oil===
Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi crude oil production was about (BPD). In 2006 Iraqi crude oil production averaged 2.12 million BPD. In mid-2006, the Iraqi oil minister, said that &quot;he expected output to rise to approximately 4 m BPD by 2010, increasing to 6 m BPD by 2012.&quot;

The situation has been characterized by some Oil Ministry officials as chaotic, with one official stating &quot;We do not know the exact quantity of oil we are exporting, we do not exactly know the prices we are selling it for, and we do not know where the oil revenue is going to.&quot;

In Summer, 2008, the nation&#x27;s Parliament still had not produced a comprehensive &quot;hydrocarbon law&quot; (oil law) apportioning revenue between local governorates and the central government. While oil production in early 2008 exceeded pre-war levels and continued to climb, disagreements remained among oil-rich regions, oil-poor regions, and the national government over contracting rights and revenue-sharing.

===Healthcare===

Until the early 1990s, Iraq&#x27;s healthcare system was considered one of the most advanced in the Middle East. Following the Gulf War, it began to deteriorate. Prior to the Iraq War, healthcare spending amounted to 50 cents (US) per Iraqi per year. Today, the Iraqi healthcare system has regressed to a chronic and smoldering condition. Infections are widespread, the infant mortality rate has surged, and medical shortages all threaten the once functioning medical system. US based NGO, Giving Children Hope, has an ongoing healthcare development program in Iraq that equips hospitals and clinics with needed supplies and equipment in conjunction with the US military. 

However, the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan is quite different. Due to their better stability as well as autonomy, the Kurdistan region enjoys health care superior to that under Saddam. Health workers have not left the provinces for neighboring counties, as they have in sectarian Iraq, and new programs for continuing professional education in major Iraqi Kurdish cities reflect the optimism of the area.

With the primarily Sunni Al Anbar governorate to the west experiencing increased stability due to the U.S. troop surge and the Sunni rejection of Al Qaeda in Iraq, International Health analysts hope to see improved health care there, as well. It remains to be seen whether non-governmental organizations and the Shiite-dominated central Iraqi government will take advantage of the enhanced security to enact sustainable services and other improvements. Local initiatives in June 2008 included contracting with the International Medical Corps for a comprehensive Anbar continuing medical education program, rights of return for expatriate health professionals, and an overhaul of nursing, with innovative programs paralleling the &quot;diploma&quot; nursing track of the West, and a goal of attracting women to nursing as a career (70% of Iraqi nurses are male).

Until late 2007, the Ministry of Health had been apportioned by the new Shiite majority to politicians aligned with Moqtada Al Sadr, a minority Shiite party leader and head of a sect prominent in East Baghdad slums. Allegations abounded of abductions of Sunni patients, and Iraqi Security Force (Army and Police) patients, from their hospital beds. The Inspector General was prosecuted for corruption, and the Facilities Protective Service (FPS) commander was dismissed for running a Mafia-like organization, contributing weapons and manpower to terrorist and other gangs.

At the close of 2007, a new Minister of Health, Saleh Al-Hasnawi, was appointed and began ministerial reforms. The Inspector General was replaced and a new openness was encouraged. In June, 2008, the Minister of Health convened a National Strategic Planning Conference in Baghdad. At this conference, attended by professionals, NGOs and Provincial Reconstruction Teams from all over Iraq, he announced that Iraq would direct its own health reconstruction, funding it with Iraqi money according to Iraqi priorities. Although there is still a place for external expert advice, the determination of the Iraqis to direct their own health development was clear.

There are sparse data on the role of private practice in Iraq. Estimates range as high as 70% of outpatient visits, compared to approximately 30% before the war. Iraq has included health care as a constitutional right; as government-sponsored care becomes more accessible, the future of private practice will likely change, but it is an ingrained feature of the Iraqi healthcare fabric.

===Postal code system===
In 1991 and 2003, Iraq developed a postal code system which was not widely utilized. Both attempts tried to identify the street or delivery address, along with the province and post office. Unfortunately, both of these attempts had built-in limitations that would not allow for expansion and were much more complex than necessary.

In 2004, Iraq&#x27;s Postmaster General, Mr. Ibraheem Hussien Ali, and CPA/MoC postal advisors initiated an effort to correct and modernize the Iraqi postal code system.

==Private sector development==

===Proposed Baghdad Renaissance Plan===
Some private sector developments have also been proposed. One of these, The Proposed Baghdad Renaissance Plan , is a 25-year scheme, designed by architect Hisham N. Ashkouri to transform 9 km² of silt deposits into &quot;an up-market commercial and residential neighborhood&quot; astride the Tigris River in central Baghdad, as well as nearby Tahrir Square. Tahrir Square was originally part of Baghdad&#x27;s central business district, and Phase I of the plan focuses on the redevelopment of this area. 

When finished, the &quot;commerce, banking, medical, housing, broadcast and IT, exhibition, conventions and cultural centers&quot; of which the plan is comprised would be occupied by up to one-half million people. The project received encouragement by the U.S. Department of Commerce as well as other US and Middle East organizations. A smaller-scale proposal of Dr. Ashkouri&#x27;s is the Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center, a high-rise hotel and movie theater complex which would be Baghdad&#x27;s first skyscraper.

Prevailing views are that political and social instability in the region are making such developments unduly risky, despite a high projected return on investment. Security concerns during the survey and construction phases are currently a cost-prohibitive factor.

=== Baghdad ===
More visible efforts at reconstruction through private development, like architect and urban designer Hisham N. Ashkouri&#x27;s Baghdad Renaissance Plan and the Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center have also been made. A plan was proposed by a Government agency to rebuild a tourist island in 2008. Investors were sought to develop a &quot;romantic island&quot; on the River Tigris that was once a popular honeymoon spot for newlyweds. The project would include a six-star hotel, spa, an 18-hole golf course and a country club. In addition, the go-ahead has been given to build numerous architecturally unique skyscrapers along the Tigris that would develop the city&#x27;s financial center in Kadhehemiah.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC/id/26425911&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, a construction plan was proposed to rebuild the heart of Baghdad, but the plan was never realized because corruption was involved in it. The Baghdad Eye Ferris wheel, proposed in August 2008, was installed at the Al-Zawraa Park in March 2011. In May 2010, a new large scale residential and commercial project called Baghdad Gate was announced. In August 2010, Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid, was appointed to design a new headquarters for the Central Bank in Baghdad. Initial talks about the project were held in Istanbul, Turkey, on 14 August 2010, in the presence of the bank governor Sinan al-Shabibi. On 2 February 2012, Hadid joined Sinan al-Shabibi at a ceremony in London to sign the agreement between the bank and her firm for the design stages of the new building. The construction was postponed in 2015 due to economical problems, but started again in 2019. Since the end of the war, Baghdad has experienced improvement in the private sector, with launch of modern trends such as startups and incubation centers.

<doc id="610549" wikidata="Q557266" url="?curid=610549" title="Hua Xiong">
<text>Hua Xiong () (died 191), also recorded in the annotated version of Zizhi Tongjian as Ye Xiong (葉雄), was a military general serving under the warlord Dong Zhuo during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China.

==Life==
Little is recorded about Hua Xiong in history, apart from the fact that he served as a military officer under the warlord Dong Zhuo and held the position of Chief Controller (都督) or Commandant (都尉). In early 190, when a coalition of warlords from the east of Hangu Pass launched a military campaign in the name of freeing the Han central government from Dong Zhuo&#x27;s control, Hua Xiong led Dong Zhuo&#x27;s forces to engage the enemy. Hu Zhen and Lü Bu were quarrelsome, so Sun Jian could easily defeat both of them and beheaded their Chief Controller Hua Xiong in a battle at Yangren (陽人; believed to be near present-day Wenquan, Ruzhou, Henan).

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Hua Xiong plays a more significant role in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. He is described as a &quot;stalwart man of fierce mien, lithe and supple as a beast. He had a round head like a leopard and shoulders like an ape&#x27;s.&quot;

In Chapter 5, as warlords from the east of Hangu Pass form a coalition against Dong Zhuo, Hua Xiong stations at Sishui Pass to ward off the oncoming attack. When Lü Bu requests to lead troops to attack the enemy, Hua Xiong steps in and says, &quot;An ox-cleaver to kill a chicken! There is no need for the General to go. I will cut off their heads as easily as I would take a thing out of my pocket!&quot; Dong Zhuo then puts Hua Xiong in charge.

Having single-handedly slain four warriors from the coalition – Zu Mao (祖茂), Pan Feng (潘鳳), Bao Zhong (鮑忠), and Yu She (俞涉) – Hua Xiong seems invincible. Despite mistrust from many warlords of the coalition, most notably their leader Yuan Shao, Guan Yu volunteers to fight Hua Xiong. To convince them to give him the opportunity, he tells them that if he fails to defeat Hua Xiong, the coalition can take his head as punishment. When Cao Cao pours Guan Yu a cup of warm wine, Guan Yu puts it on hold and says he will return very soon victorious. As promised, Guan Yu returns quickly with Hua Xiong&#x27;s head, whilst Cao Cao who was still holding the cup of wine, realised just how quickly it took Guan Yu to slay the notorious General Hua Xiong. Cao Cao then gives the cup of wine - still warm - to Guan Yu who gulps down the wine victoriously. This is known as &quot;wen jiu zhan Hua Xiong&quot; (溫酒斬華雄), which roughly translates to &#x27;Slaying Hua Xiong while the wine remains warm&#x27;.

<text>Charles Estienne (; 1504–1564), known as Carolus Stephanus in Latin and Charles Stephens in English, was an early exponent of the science of anatomy in France. Charles was a younger brother of Robert Estienne I, the famous printer, and son to Henri, who Latinized the family name as . He married Geneviève de Berly.

After the usual humanistic training he studied medicine, and took his doctor&#x27;s degree at Paris. He was for a time tutor to Jean-Antoine de Baïf, the future poet. It is uncertain whether he taught publicly. His career was interrupted by the oppressive persecutions in which their religious opinions involved the family.

Éstienne, though from a family whose classical taste was their principal glory, did not betray the same servile imitation of the Galenian anatomy as his contemporary, Jacques Dubois. He appears to have been the first to detect valves in the orifice of the hepatic veins, though his description was vague. He was ignorant, however, of the researches of the Italian anatomists; and his description of the brain is inferior to that given sixty years before by Alessandro Achillini. His comparison of the cerebral cavities to the human ear has persuaded F. Portal that he knew the inferior cornua, the hippocampus and its prolongations; but this is no reason for giving him that honour to the detriment of the reputation of Achillini, to whom, so far as historical testimony goes, the first knowledge of this fact is due.

The researches of Éstienne into the structure of the nervous system are, however, neither useless nor inglorious; and the circumstance of demonstrating a canal through the entire length of the spinal cord, which had neither been suspected by contemporaries nor noticed by successors till Jean-Baptiste de Sénac (1693–1770) made it known, is sufficient to place him high in the rank of anatomical discoverers.

In 1551, when Robert Estienne left Paris for Geneva, Charles, who had remained a Catholic, took charge of his printing establishment, and in the same year was appointed king&#x27;s printer. In 1561 he became bankrupt, and he is said to have died in a debtors&#x27; prison.

His principal works are:
*&quot;Praedium Rusticum&quot; (1554), a collection of tracts which he had compiled from ancient writers on various branches of agriculture, and which continued to be a favorite book down to the end of the 17th century
*&quot;Dictionarium historicum ad poeticum&quot; (1553), the first French encyclopedia
*&quot;Thesaurus Ciceronianus&quot; (1557)
*&quot;De dissectione partium corporis humani libri tres&quot;, with well-drawn woodcuts (1545)
He also published a translation of an Italian comedy, &quot;Gli Ingannati&quot;, under the title of &quot;Le Sacrifice&quot; (1543; republished as &quot;Les Abus&quot;, 1549), which had some influence on the development of French comedy; and &quot;Paradoxes&quot; (1553), an imitation of the &quot;Paradossi&quot; of Ortensio Landi.

His daughter Nicole Estienne became a prolific poet.

<doc id="610554" wikidata="Q2915356" url="?curid=610554" title="Jodi (art collective)">
<text>Jodi, is a collective of two internet artists, Joan Heemskerk (born 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, the Netherlands) and Dirk Paesmans (born 1965 in Brussels, Belgium), created in 1994. They were some of the first artists to create Web art and later started to create software art and artistic computer game modification. Their most well-known art piece is their website wwwwwwwww.jodi.org, which is a landscape of intricate designs made in basic HTML. JODI is represented by Upstream Gallery, Amsterdam.

== The artists ==
Joan Heemskerk was born in 1968 in Kaatsheuvel, the Netherlands, and Dirk Paesmans was born in 1965 in Brussels, Belgium. They both have a background in photography and video art and studied at the CADRE Laboratory for New Media at San Jose State University in California. Paesmans also studied at Kunstakademie Düsseldorf with the founder of video art Nam June Paik.

Both Heemskerk and Paesmans live and work out of the Netherlands.

== Artworks ==
In 1999 they began the practice of modifying old video games such as &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; to create art mods like &quot;SOD&quot;. Their efforts were celebrated in the 1999 Webby Awards, where they took top prize in the category of &quot;net art.&quot; Jodi used their 5-word acceptance speech (a Webby Award tradition) to criticize the event with the words &quot;Ugly commercial sons of bitches.&quot; Further video game modifications soon followed for &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot;, and the latest, &quot;Max Payne 2&quot; (2006), to create a new set of art games. Jodi&#x27;s approach to game modification is comparable in many ways to deconstructivism in architecture because they would disassemble the game to its basic parts, and reassemble it in ways that do not make intuitive sense. In one of their more well-known modifications of &quot;Quake&quot; places, the player inside a closed cube with swirling black-and-white patterns on each side. The pattern is the result of a glitch in the game engine discovered by the artists, presumably, through trial and error; it is generated live as the Quake engine tries, and fails, to visualize the interior of a cube with black-and-white checkered wallpaper.

=== &quot;Screen Grab&quot; Period (2002- ) ===
Since 2002, Jodi have been in what has been called their &quot;Screen Grab&quot; period, making video works by recording a computer monitor&#x27;s output while working, playing video games, or coding. The &quot;Screen Grab&quot; period began with the four-screen video installation &quot;My%Desktop&quot; (2002), which premiered at the Plugin Media Lab in Basel. The piece appeared to depict large, malfunctioning Mac OS 9 monitors that displayed cascading windows, error messages, and files endlessly replicating themselves. To make this video, Jodi pointed-and-clicked and dragged-and-dropped frantically to give an appearance of uncontrolled chaos.

Their exhibition &quot;Jodi: goodmorning goodnight&quot; was on display at the Whitney Museum from 2013 to 2015. Another project, &quot;OXO&quot; (2018), premiered at the Lightbox Gallery at Harvard University and, later that year, would also form Jodi&#x27;s contribution to the group exhibition &quot;Difference Engine&quot; at the Lisson Gallery in New York City, New York. The piece is an interactive multichannel installation based on old computer games and tic-tac-toe. 

Alongside &quot;Difference Engine,&quot; Jodi also held their first solo exhibition in the Los Angeles area— a self-titled exhibition at the And/Or Gallery in Pasadena, California which involved, in part, recreating the gallery&#x27;s coffered ceiling on the floor to be navigated by visitors.

A 2012 &quot;Vice&quot; magazine article said JODI&#x27;s work &quot;underlines the innate anarchy of the online medium, an arena that we&#x27;ve come to recognize as public but one that the duo constantly undermines and tweaks to their own purposes.&quot;

As of October 2019, &quot;My%Desktop&quot; is part of the permanent collection presentation of the new MoMA (Museum of Modern Art) in New York. The work is presented as a monumental installation of four adjacent projections, showing screen grabs of JODI&#x27;s desktop-performance.

<doc id="610564" wikidata="Q2973579" url="?curid=610564" title="Captain Universe">
<text>Captain Universe is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Bill Mantlo and Michael Golden, the character first appeared in &quot;Micronauts&quot; #8 (August 1979). Captain Universe is the guardian and protector of Eternity. Rather than a character with a single identity, it is a persona that has merged with several hosts during its publication history.

==Publication history==
Captain Universe first appeared in &quot;Micronauts&quot; #8 (August 1979) and was created by Bill Mantlo and Michael Golden.

Captain Universe hosts have appeared in either special one-shots or short stories throughout the years, initially in the first series of the &quot;Micronauts&quot; in 1979.

Captain Universe was the starring feature in issues #9–11 of the tryout series &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot;. The series&#x27; editor Al Milgrom recalled being taken away by the concept of a Captain Universe serial: &quot;You could come up with three issues, three disparate individuals — each one very different from the other — and see how they use their powers. They wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be superheroic types; they&#x27;d be regular people who fell into the powers for just one issue. ... But Captain Universe never got his own title, so I&#x27;m guessing it didn&#x27;t sell terribly well.&quot; The character appeared sporadically through the remainder of the 1980s in titles such as &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; and &quot;Contest of Champions&quot;.

His appearances became even scarcer in the 1990s, appearing in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;What If?&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Powers Unlimited&quot;.

In 1994, Captain Universe appeared in a one-shot, coinciding with a promotion, with the claim that readers could have a comic about themselves made for a fee. The comics were generally stock stories, with minor details altered based on information provided by the purchaser. Jeff Christiansen, then a veterinary student and who would later become the force behind the resurgence of the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; in the mid-2000s, was written and drawn as the official Captain Universe of the comic so that it could be considered an in-continuity comic. The one-shot was titled &quot;X-Men/Captain Universe: Sleeping Giants&quot;.

In 2005, after a four-year break from comic appearances, Captain Universe returned in the second series of &quot;Amazing Fantasy.&quot; Also in 2005, a series of one-shot specials were released featuring different characters from the Marvel Universe as the Uni-Power each imbues them with power of Captain Universe. These titles were &quot;Captain Universe/Hulk&quot;, &quot;Captain Universe/Daredevil&quot;, &quot;Captain Universe/X-23&quot;, &quot;Captain Universe/Invisible Woman&quot; and &quot;Captain Universe/Silver Surfer&quot;. The Uni-Power made a brief appearance in &quot;Nextwave&quot;, he also made a &quot;cameo&quot; as Cosmic Spider-Man for the variant cover of &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; #3 and played an important part in the Death&#x27;s Head 3.0 saga chronicled in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot;.

Captain Universe made his return in &quot;: Star-Lord&quot; and then in &quot;Annihilation Conquest&quot; #3. Captain Universe later returns to stop the Juggernaut, in an attempt to fulfill his destiny, as seen in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #627–629.

==Fictional character biography==
The Uni-Power is an extra-dimensional force that possesses an individual (or on one occasion, twins) in a time of crisis, transforming that person into Captain Universe. As Captain Universe, the transformed person typically retains his or her original personality and appearance, though with Captain Universe&#x27;s costume and heroic traits superimposed over the original. The Uni-Power itself emanates from the Enigma Force, the exact nature of which, naturally, remains an enigma. It is believed, however, to be connected to the Microverse, home of the Micronauts. Although the Uni-Power typically empowers normal, non-super-powered humans, it has in the past empowered Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Commander Arcturus Rann of the Micronauts, a toddler, and a dog, among others. Its counterparts in various alternate timelines have also possessed Mar-Vell, Mr. Fantastic, a member of the alien Badoon race, a Doombot and Quasar. Because of its never-ending supply of energy it has been the target of many individuals, terrorist groups and peacekeeping agencies such as AIM, the Psycho-Man, Doctor Doom and even S.H.I.E.L.D.

The first human Captain Universe was an astronaut named Captain Ray Coffin. He battled Baron Karza and sealed the Prometheus Pit between the Microverse and Earth. Years later, the Uni-Power would possess his son Steve Coffin to battle Mister E and his shadow slaves. It next possessed identical twins Ann Stafford and Clare Dodgson to capture Nemesis, and then possessed small-time cat burglar Monty Walsh to stop mafia don Guido Carboni. It then possessed Doctor Strange and Commander Arcturus Rann to reinforce the space-wall between the Microverse and the Macroverse. It then possessed Bruce Banner for the first time, to defuse a nuclear missile, and wound up battling Banner&#x27;s own alter ego the Hulk. Captain Universe was then next among the heroes summoned by the Grandmaster for the Contest of Champions. The Captain Universe power next possessed Delayne Masters to defeat schoolyard bullies. It then possessed Evan Swann to stop the Quantum Mechanic from destroying the Earth.

When the Captain Universe power next appeared, it possessed Spider-Man to stop the Tri-Sentinel (although the power was initially weaker than usual, causing Spider-Man to assume that his own powers had merely increased). The latently cosmic-powered Spider-Man battled the Trapster, Titania, Magneto, Brothers Grimm, Goliath, Hulk, TESS-One, Dragon Man, and the Tri-Sentinel itself. It next possessed a toddler called Eddie Price to battle Gart and Rath.

When the Guardians of the Galaxy traveled to the 20th century on a mission to destroy the Badoon, the Uni-Power possessed a Badoon worker named L&#x27;Matto to prevent the planned genocide. L&#x27;Matto&#x27;s newfound knowledge was able to keep the Guardians from attacking but the Brother Royal then used the Badoon Captain Universe as his champion in a gladiatorial challenge which he had coerced the Guardians into accepting. L&#x27;Matto easily overpowered Charlie-27 and was about to kill him when Vance Astro and Dr. Strange arrived and joined in the battle, with Nikki and Talon pitching in as well. Despite this, it was not until Aleta (who had become the new Starhawk) arrived and attacked alongside Doctor Strange that L&#x27;Matto was finally defeated, enabling Strange to exorcise the Uni-Power which L&#x27;Matto had abused and return it to Earth.

Captain Universe later returned, and the Uni-Power possesses various heroes (the Hulk; X-23; Daredevil, who regained his sight while possessed; the Invisible Woman; Gladiator; and the Silver Surfer); all in a mission to restore its power which has been severely weakened from a mysterious force emanating from the darkest corners of the Microverse. Using the copied powers of each hero, it took paraplegic war veteran Gabriel Vargas as its host to face the one responsible for its weakening.

At some unknown point, Captain Universe&#x27;s latest host Gabriel Vargas is arrested by the Kree Government for accidentally attacking a group of Kree who were killing people who he thought were innocents but were actually sympathetic to the genocidal actions of the Annihilation Wave. For months, he was studied by the Kree who, despite their highly advanced technology, could not learn much about the Uni-Power other than that the suit given to all users is actually a molecular shell and not spandex as was previously believed. Eventually, Gabriel is released from prison and put into a highly aggressive session of training by the Kree Military as he and several other prisoners prepare for a mission that will halt the Phalanx&#x27;s technophage virus from spreading further. Gabriel lost the Uni-Power after finding a cure for a Phalanx airborne virus and joined Star-Lord in battling the Phalanx. He was subsequently killed by the Phalanx select Blastaar during an attack on the Phalanx Babel Spire.

During &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; storyline, a new Captain Universe makes himself known when he arrives on Earth with plans to kill Juggernaut. Spider-Man learns that Captain Universe is a man named William Nguyen, whose life had been ruined in one of Juggernaut&#x27;s rampages. When Nguyen insists on trying to kill Juggernaut instead of fixing the tectonic plates beneath New York City, the Uni-Power leaves him and enters the Juggernaut. The Juggernaut as Captain Universe repairs the damage to the tectonic plates that was caused by him during the same rampage that had ruined Nguyen&#x27;s life. After the &quot;healing&quot; of the tectonic plates, the Uni-Power subsequently departs.

Three former hosts of the Uni-Power (Susan Storm, Spider-Man and X-23) are all contacted by the Enigma Force once again when the Whirldemon King, a powerful entity once defeated by the time-traveling Prince Wayfinder of Ithaca and creator of the Enigma Force itself, escapes imprisonment. When X-23 sacrifices herself to save Valeria Richards from possession by the King the Uni-Power bonds with her a second time. While trapped in the Whirldemons&#x27; prison dimension, a connection is explicitly made between a starry apparition that enabled Laura to throw off the influence of a demon attempting to coerce her into serving it, when the star-shaped mark left on Laura&#x27;s palm after that encounter is recognized by the Whirldemon King as associated with the Enigma Force. Laura then uses the Uni-Power to wound the Whirldemon King and seal him back in his prison dimension, before returning her to Earth. During these events the Enigma Force tells Laura that she has been designated the future heir to its power.

An African-American woman acting as the newest Captain Universe joins the Avengers in the fight against Ex Nihilo, his sister Abyss, and a Builder named Aleph on Mars. Captain Universe vaporizes Aleph when he does not agree to stop transforming or destroying planets. She is revealed to be Tamara Devoux, a woman who remained in a coma for ten years after a car crash. During a talk with Nightmask, she translates his language and announces that not only is the universe dying, but the White Event is coming.

During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, the Spider-Men summoned the Enigma Force to aid them in their fight. The Enigma Force chose to make Miles Morales the new Captain Universe, which he used to help defeat them. Using the Sword Vigor from Leopardon, Miles was able to defeat Solus, Brix, Bora, and Daemos. The Enigma Force left him after the battle was won.

During the &quot;King in Black&quot; storyline, the Enigma Force is revealed by Jean Grey to be the &quot;God of Light&quot; of the Marvel Universe, with properties similar to those of symbiotes and counterpart of the malevolent, darkness-based deity Knull. Silver Surfer arrives to where the Enigma Force is and frees it from the symbiotes, leading to it choosing Eddie Brock as the new Captain Universe.

==Powers and abilities==
The cosmic entity possesses superhuman attributes, such as superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, durability, and senses. Its Uni-Vision power is a form of cosmic consciousness, granting microscopic vision, X-ray vision, telescopic vision, and an individual to tell the truth. The cosmic being owns a psychic awareness of imminent danger. It possesses the ability of molecular rearrangement of organic and inorganic matter, transmutation of elements, the ability to fire bursts of energy and concussive force, and hypnosis (using the Uni-Vision energy). The character can also use telekinesis.

The abilities of Captain Universe can vary from host to host. The comic entity enhances their partner&#x27;s powers if they possess one or more similar abilities.

The power of the Enigma Force is tied to the dimension of its origin. The wielder will lose their powers if they travel to other realities.

==Hosts==
===Other realities===
==Enemies==
Over the years, the various hosts of Captain Universe have faced many enemies from across the Marvel Universe. The most formidable of them have proven to be Baron Karza, Dr. Doom, Magneto, the Gray Hulk, Terminus, the Tri-Sentinel, Division U, S.H.I.E.L.D., A.I.M. and Knull.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Jasmine Shanelle of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; included Captain Universe in their &quot;6 of Marvel’s Most Powerful Women Who Have Yet to Hit the Big Screen&quot; list. Matthew Jackson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; included Captain Universe in their &quot;15 Marvel superheroes and villains we want to see in the MCU&quot; list. Marc Buxton of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Captain Universe 11th in their &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy 3: 50 Marvel Characters We Want to See&quot; list. &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy 3: 50 Marvel Characters We Want to See&quot; list. &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Captain Universe 1st in their &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Strongest Cosmic Heroes&quot; list, 1st in their &quot;Marvel Comics: The 20 Most Powerful Female Members Of The Avengers&quot; list, and 12th in their &quot;20 Powerful Female Marvel Characters We Hope To See In The MCU&#x27;s Phase Four&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Captain Universe Initiative / Death&#x27;s Head 3.0===
In one possible future of the Marvel Universe, Advanced Idea Mechanics has examined the Uni-Power and attempted to duplicate it with the Captain Universe Initiative. The duplicate, referred to as the &#x27;Alias-Power&#x27; or &#x27;Uni-Alias&#x27;, has the ability to animate the Death&#x27;s Head 3.0 robot. While resident in Death&#x27;s Head, it took the form of a conscience. On one occasion, when asked to rescue an evil scientist from a jail, it instead rescued a human rights activist. When the robot killed a UN researcher, the power brought him back to life. The researcher then confronted the robot, forcing it to acknowledge the conscience. Afterwards, Death&#x27;s Head began working for the UN as an anti-terrorist hit-man.

===The Captain Universe-Quasar composite entity of Earth-Set===
After finally freeing himself of a circular orbit in an imploding dimension, the superhero known as Quasar returned to the site of a major battle between himself, Doctor Strange, The Thing, Thor, and the evil Elder God Set. Shocked to find his comrades dead, Quasar screamed into the heavens as a glowing red light consumed him. It changed him and infused him with the powers of Captain Universe. After merging the Uni-Power with his own Quantum Band, Quasar took Doctor Strange&#x27;s Eye of Agamotto and left the imploding dimension.

When he arrived, most of the remaining heroes had been murdered by either Set&#x27;s fearsome power or at the hands of his seven mind-controlled brides. Quasar found The Silver Surfer attempting to keep the creature at bay. Filled with an immeasurable amount of rage, the Quasar/Captain Universe entity summoned the Eye of Agamotto and pulled himself and Set into the Eye&#x27;s pocket dimension where they would do battle for all eternity. Later on, Quasar of Earth-616 viewed his counterpart facing Set.

===Spider-Ham becomes Captain Zooniverse===
In the Larval Zooniverse, Peter Porker (who was secretly the superhero Spider-Ham) was working on an experiment that went awry and bestowed upon him the cosmic power of Captain Zooniverse. With this new power he defeated all of his enemies and trapped them in orbit around Earth. He returned home a bit later and began a new villain-free life with his girlfriend Mary Jane Waterbuffalo.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
An issue of &quot;What If?&quot; asks the question &quot;What If Spider-Man Had Kept His Cosmic Powers?&quot; Spider-Man becomes corrupted by power when the Captain Universe energies decide to stay with him. He ends up battling his Avengers friends when they don&#x27;t agree with his methods. A confrontation with a rogue Doombot leaves an innocent hostage dead. Peter manages to give up the entirety of his powers, including his spider-ones. Later, Peter&#x27;s child manifests a combination of Captain Universe and Spider-Man powers.

===Captain Universe of the Law Enforcement squad===
During the Abraxas Saga, a team of Avengers-esque super heroes called the Law Enforcement Squad appeared in Earth-616. They were headed by an intelligent version of the Hulk who was not Bruce Banner. Joining this strange version of the behemoth were the World War II-era heroes Red Raven, Bucky, Namora and The Whizzer (Bob Frank). Other members included a heroic version of the Spider-Man villain The Rose, Doctor Druid, Living Lightning, the Shroud and a male Captain Universe. 

The true identity of this Captain Universe was never revealed but the host had more than likely had the Uni-Power for several years. During the battle between the Law Enforcement Squad and the Fantastic Four; Captain Universe and Dr. Druid ganged up on Reed Richards to destabilize the Fantastic Four&#x27;s cohesion as a team. With only seconds to spare, Reed convinces Captain Universe that something is out of place and that the Fantastic Four are not his enemies. Captain Universe reveals to Druid that Reed is telling the truth, but before he can convince the others to stop fighting, he is struck down by Nova.

Reed and Druid travel into a portal left by Captain Universe&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; only to find him alive and well within the body of Earth-616&#x27;s Eternity. Captain Universe explains to the two superheroes of the creation of the Multi-Eternity that ensures a boundless multiverse. Afterwards Captain Universe vanishes without a trace while Reed and Druid return to their respective realities after a confrontation with Abraxas, the antithesis of Eternity and Galactus.

===Captain Universe of Earth X===
Captain Universe&#x27;s history in the &quot;Earth X&quot; series was relatively the same as it had been on Earth-616 up until the &quot;Infinity Gauntlet Saga&quot;, where an unknown Captain Universe fought alongside Kismet, the Silver Surfer, Comet Man, Carol Danvers, Nova and Star-Lord. Years later Arcturus Rann died in a battle against the Psycho Man and took the Enigma Force with him to the afterlife. Captain Universe was transferred into the Kree superhero Mar-Vell and eventually became part of a completed Cosmic Conscience which revived the Perfect Knowledge of the Perfect Universe which had been destroyed countless millennia ago by The Celestials. Captain Universe later joined with Reed Richards to form the new Eternity. They were last seen preparing to save Franklin from The Celestials and The Elders of the Universe.

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===
An alternate universe variant of Peter Parker from Earth-13 who retained the Enigma Force appears in &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;. He attempts to protect the other Spider-Men before being killed by the Inheritors&#x27; father Solus.

<text>The Royal Game (also known as Chess Story; in the original German Schachnovelle, &quot;Chess Novella&quot;) is a novella by the Austrian author Stefan Zweig written in 1941, the year before the author&#x27;s death by suicide. In some editions, the title is used for a collection that also includes &quot;Amok&quot;, &quot;Burning Secret&quot;, &quot;Fear&quot;, and &quot;Letter From an Unknown Woman&quot;.

==Plot summary==
An anonymous narrator opens the story by describing the boarding of a passenger liner traveling from New York to Buenos Aires. One of the passengers is world chess champion Mirko Czentovic. Czentovic is an idiot savant and prodigy with no obvious qualities apart from his talent for chess. The narrator plays chess with his wife, hoping to draw Czentovic&#x27;s attention and engage him in a game. The narrator draws the attention of McConnor, a businessman, who offers to pay Czentovic&#x27;s fee.

A group of passengers (including the narrator and McConnor) play Czentovic in a , which Czentovic wins. They are about to lose a second game when they are interrupted by Dr B., who prevents them from blundering and guides the party to a draw.

Dr B. tells his story to the narrator. He was a lawyer who managed the assets of the Austrian nobility and church. He was arrested by the Gestapo, who hoped to extract information from Dr B. in order to steal the assets. The Gestapo kept Dr B. imprisoned in a hotel, in total isolation, but Dr B. maintained his sanity by stealing a book of past masters&#x27; chess games, which he learned completely. After absorbing every single move in the book, he began to play against himself, developing the ability to separate his psyche into two personas. He spent more and more time pacing up and down his cell, mentally playing chess games. This behavior became more and more obsessive and frantic, as he gradually was losing contact with reality. At some point, he accidentally wounded himself and was carried to a hospital. A sympathetic physician, knowing of his situation, attested his insanity to keep him from being imprisoned again by the Nazis, and he was freed. The doctor advised him to avoid chess, in order not to trigger his compulsive behavior.

The passengers persuade Dr B. to play alone against Czentovic. Dr B. agrees, as he wants to know if his chess ability was real or only a self delusion, but warns that he must not be allowed to play a second game. In a stunning demonstration of his imaginative and combinational powers, Dr B. beats the world champion. Czentovic suggests another game to restore his honour, and Dr B. immediately agrees. But this time, having sensed that Dr B. was impatient when it took too long to move, Czentovic tries to irritate his opponent by taking several minutes to make each move, thereby putting psychological pressure on Dr B., who gets more and more agitated as the game proceeds. He begins to walk around the room between moves, as in a trance, rehearsing imagined matches against himself repeatedly and manically. The narrator is alarmed as he sees the old obsession resurfacing. Dr B. eventually declares a check by his bishop that isn&#x27;t there: in his mind he&#x27;s playing a different game from that on the board. The narrator urges Dr B. to stop playing, recalling to him the doctor&#x27;s advice, awakening Dr B. from his frenzy. Dr B. resigns the game, apologizes for his outbursts, and withdraws from the board. As Dr B. leaves, Czentovic comments that he had been mounting a reasonable attack.

==Historical background==

Following the occupation and annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, the country&#x27;s monarchists (i.e. supporters of Otto von Habsburg as the rightful Emperor-Archduke and the rule of the House of Habsburg), conservatives as well as supporters of Engelbert Dollfuss&#x27; Austrofascist regime, were severely persecuted by the Nazis, as they were seen as opponents of the Nazi regime. Thousands of monarchists were executed or sent to concentration camps, and the pretender to the throne, Otto von Habsburg, fled to the United States, being sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Nazis.

===Alekhine vs. Bogoljubow, Pistyan 1922===

Throughout the story, chess games are not described in detail. Instead, the narrative focuses on the general nature of chess and the psychological aspects of gameplay. One exception occurs during the second consultation game against Czentovic, which is given some detail. Czentovic plays as White while McConnor, the narrator and others jointly decide each move for Black. Following 37... c2 and White&#x27;s response, the consultation party are about to play 38... c1=Q?, promoting their pawn to a queen, but they are stopped at the last moment by Dr B., who enters the story.

Dr B. explains that the newly promoted black queen will be captured immediately by a white bishop, which will then be captured by a black knight, after which White will advance his own passed pawn to d7, attacking a black rook. According to Dr B., even if Black responds by checking White with their knight, White will still win in &quot;nine or ten&quot; moves. Dr B. says that the position — and the abovethreatened combination — are &quot;almost the same&quot; as Alekhine vs. Bogoljubow, Pistyan, 1922. Dr B. instead advises 38... Kh7, which Black plays. In the story, play continues 39. h4 Rc4 40. e5 Nxe5, and Dr B. advises Black to &quot;force an exchange&quot;. &quot;Some seven moves later&quot;, Czentovic offers a draw.

Although the story&#x27;s game—and its position at the critical moment—are not described in full, the given details (and potential variation) are identical with the real game mentioned by Dr B., played between Alekhine and Bogoljubow, following 38. d6. The fictional game, also like the real one, ended as a draw (roughly) seven moves after 40... Nxe5 was played. The real game concluded with each side capturing the other&#x27;s passed pawns (which each threatened immediate promotion); in the final position the material was equal (White had a bishop for Black&#x27;s knight), although Black retained a passed pawn at a6.

===Algebraic notation===

Both in its original German text and also in later translations, &quot;The Royal Game&quot; makes use of algebraic notation to describe chess moves. At the time of its publication (and of its fictional setting) in the early 1940s, algebraic notation was widespread in German-speaking chess culture, but had not been widely accepted in the Anglosphere, which still made use of descriptive notation. During the 1970s and 1980s, algebraic notation was gradually accepted in the English-speaking world and standardized by FIDE as the proper method for recording chess games. The use of algebraic notation in English translations of &quot;The Royal Game&quot; is therefore not an anachronism.

In the story, algebraic notation itself also functions as a plot device. When Dr B. suffers a nervous breakdown and recovers in a hospital, a doctor asks whether he is a mathematician or a chemist. During Dr B.&#x27;s delirium, he would shout formulaic expressions, e.g. &quot;c3, c4&quot;, terminology unfamiliar to the medical staff. 

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Royal Game&quot; was the inspiration for the 1960 Gerd Oswald film &quot;Brainwashed&quot;, originally titled &quot;Schachnovelle&quot;, as well as for two Czechoslovakian films: the 1980 &quot;Královská hra&quot; (&quot;The Royal Game&quot;) and &quot;Šach mat (Checkmate),&quot; made for television in 1964.

&quot;The Royal Game&quot; was also the inspiration for the 2021 Philipp Stölzl film &quot;Chess Story&quot;, originally titled &quot;Schachnovelle&quot;.

In 2024 Jason Kouchak performed the world premiere of his composition &quot;The Royal Game&quot; at the opening of the 45th Chess Olympiad in Budapest.

An opera based on the novel premiered at the Kiel Opera House on 18 May 2013. The music was by Cristóbal Halffter, and the libretto by Wolfgang Haendeler.

The story was the basis of the production &quot;64 Squares&quot; from the Rhum and Clay Theatre Company presented at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2015. In this production the character &quot;B&quot; is played by three actors, both separately and together, assisted by a percussionist.

The 2023 Hungarian psychological thriller &quot;Mastergame&quot; has several story elements and characters based on the novel. Most of the movie is set on the last refugee train leaving the country as the 1956 Revolution is being crushed by the invading Soviet army. &quot;B&quot;, in this movie is a priest who was first tortured by the Nazis during the war to reveal the location of church treasure he hid to prevent the Nazis from taking it, and managed to withstand physical torture and not talk. Now the Communists try to get the location of the same treasure out of him, opting for a different approach, trying psychological torture by keeping him in isolation. However, not everything is as it seems: the chess book he manages to steal was planted deliberately to induce his schizophrenia and break him mentally, while Czentovic is also deeply involved in this plot.

<text>Charles Drake (born Charles Ruppert; October 2, 1917 – September 10, 1994) was an American actor.

==Biography==
Drake was born in New York City. He graduated from Nichols College and became a salesman. In 1939, he turned to acting and signed a contract with Warner Bros., but he was not immediately successful. Drake served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Drake returned to Hollywood in 1945 and was cast in &quot;Conflict&quot; which starred Humphrey Bogart. His contract with Warner Brothers eventually ended. In the 1940s, he did some freelance work, including &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; (1946). 

In 1949, he moved to Universal Studios, where he co-starred with James Stewart and Shelley Winters in &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950) and again co-starred with Stewart in the film &quot;Harvey&quot; (also 1950) a screen adaptation of the Broadway play. He co-starred in the Audie Murphy biopic &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; (1955), as Murphy&#x27;s close friend, &quot;Brandon&quot;.

In 1955, Drake turned to television as one of the stock-company players on &quot;Montgomery&#x27;s Summer Stock&quot;, a summer replacement for &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents,&quot; and from 1957 he hosted the syndicated TV espionage weekly &quot;Schilling Playhouse&quot; (also known as &quot;Rendezvous&quot;). In 1956 Drake appeared as Tom Sweeny with Murphy and Anne Bancroft in &quot;Walk the Proud Land&quot;.

In 1959, he teamed again with Audie Murphy, this time in the Western film &quot;No Name on the Bullet&quot;, with Murphy in a rare villainous role as a hired assassin and Drake playing a small-town doctor trying to stop his reign of terror.

On November 14, 1961, Drake played state line boss Allen Winter in the episode &quot;The Accusers&quot; of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Laramie&quot; Western series. On February 6, 1963, Drake played Hollister in the &quot;Wagon Train&quot; episode &quot;The Hollister John Garrison Story&quot;. He also played Charles Maury in &quot;The Charles Maury Story&quot; in 1958, Season 1, episode 32.

Drake played the part of Oliver Greer in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; episode &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; (1967). He guest-starred in the fourth season (1968–1969) of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; as Simon Jarvis. In 1969, Drake appeared as Milo Cantrell on the TV series &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode titled &quot;A Woman of Stone.&quot; In 1970, he appeared as Randolf in &quot;The Men From Shiloh&quot; (the rebranded name of &quot;The Virginian&quot;) in the episode titled &quot;Jenny.&quot; He played in eighty-three films between 1939 and 1975, including &quot;Scream, Pretty Peggy&quot;. More than fifty were dramas, but he also acted in comedies, science fiction, horror, and film noir. In an episode of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series (&quot;The Deadly Years&quot;, 1967), he guested as Commodore Stocker.

He died on September 10, 1994, in East Lyme, Connecticut, at the age of 76.

<text>The following Lists of Palestinians are lists of people with either a self-designation (endonym) or a foreign appellation (exonym) as &quot;Palestinian&quot;, or who were born in the region of Palestine.

Approximately 12 million people today identify as &quot;Palestinians&quot;, as defined in the Palestinian National Charter of 1968.

==Mandate period and after==
The first list &quot;Mandate period and after&quot; consists of people who identify as &quot;Palestinians&quot; since the creation of Mandatory Palestine in 1920. The list does not include those Palestinian Jews or other Israeli citizens who are native to the geographic region of Palestine, unless they self-identify as &quot;Palestinians&quot;.

==Pre-Mandate==
The second list &quot;Pre-Mandate&quot; consists of people with roots in the region of Palestine prior to the modern identity politics resulting from the creation of Mandatory Palestine and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. As well as native Palestinian Muslims and Christians, the list includes those Jews, Samaritans, Druze, and Dom who were native to the geographic region of Palestine. The list also include some famous names and titles as exonyms, prior to nationalism and national identity becoming commonplace in the modern era.

<doc id="610582" wikidata="Q1137941" url="?curid=610582" title="Escapement">
<text>An escapement is a mechanical linkage in mechanical watches and clocks that gives impulses to the timekeeping element and periodically releases the gear train to move forward, advancing the clock&#x27;s hands. The impulse action transfers energy to the clock&#x27;s timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or balance wheel) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle and keep the timekeeper oscillating. The escapement is driven by force from a coiled spring or a suspended weight, transmitted through the timepiece&#x27;s gear train. Each swing of the pendulum or balance wheel releases a tooth of the escapement&#x27;s &quot;escape wheel&quot;, allowing the clock&#x27;s gear train to advance or &quot;escape&quot; by a fixed amount. This regular periodic advancement moves the clock&#x27;s hands forward at a steady rate. At the same time, the tooth gives the timekeeping element a push, before another tooth catches on the escapement&#x27;s pallet, returning the escapement to its &quot;locked&quot; state. The sudden stopping of the escapement&#x27;s tooth is what generates the characteristic &quot;ticking&quot; sound heard in operating mechanical clocks and watches. 

The first mechanical escapement, the verge escapement, was invented in medieval Europe during the 13th century and was the crucial innovation that led to the development of the mechanical clock. The design of the escapement has a large effect on a timepiece&#x27;s accuracy, and improvements in escapement design drove improvements in time measurement during the era of mechanical timekeeping from the 13th through the 19th century. 

Escapements are also used in other mechanisms besides timepieces. Manual typewriters used escapements to step the carriage as each letter (or space) was typed.

==History==
The invention of the escapement was an important step in the history of technology, as it made the all-mechanical clock possible. The first all-mechanical escapement, the verge escapement, was invented in 13th-century Europe. It allowed timekeeping methods to move from continuous processes such as the flow of water in water clocks, to repetitive oscillatory processes such as the swing of pendulums, enabling more accurate timekeeping. Oscillating timekeepers are the controlling devices in all modern clocks.
===Liquid-driven escapements===
The earliest liquid-driven escapement was described by the Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium in the 3rd century BC in chapter 31 of his technical treatise &quot;Pneumatics&quot;, as part of a washstand. A counterweighted spoon, supplied by a water tank, tips over in a basin when full, releasing a spherical piece of pumice in the process. Once the spoon has emptied, it is pulled up again by the counterweight, closing the door on the pumice by the tightening string. Remarkably, Philo&#x27;s comment that &quot;its construction is similar to that of clocks&quot; indicates that such escapement mechanisms were already integrated in ancient water clocks.

In China, the Tang dynasty Buddhist monk Yi Xing, along with government official Liang Lingzan, made in 723 (or 725) AD the escapement for the workings of a water-powered armillary sphere and clock drive, which was the world&#x27;s first clockwork escapement. Song dynasty horologists Zhang Sixun and Su Song duly applied escapement devices for their astronomical clock towers in the 10th century, where water flowed into a container on a pivot. However, the technology later stagnated and retrogressed. According to historian Derek J. de Solla Price, the Chinese escapement spread west and was the source of Western escapement technology.

According to Ahmad Y. Hassan, a mercury escapement described in a Spanish document for Alfonso X in 1277 can be traced to earlier Arabic sources. Knowledge of these mercury escapements may have spread through Europe with translations of Arabic and Spanish texts.

However, none of these were true mechanical escapements, since they still depended on the flow of liquid through a hole to measure time. In these designs, a container tipped over each time it filled up, thus advancing the clock&#x27;s wheels each time an equal quantity of water was measured out. The time between releases depended on the rate of flow, as do all liquid clocks. The rate of flow of a liquid through a hole varies with temperature and viscosity changes and decreases with pressure as the level of liquid in the source container drops. The development of mechanical clocks depended on the invention of an escapement which would allow a clock&#x27;s movement to be controlled by an oscillating weight, which would stay constant.

===Mechanical escapements===
The first mechanical escapement, the verge escapement, was used in a bell-ringing apparatus called an for several centuries before it was adapted to clocks. Some sources claim that French architect Villard de Honnecourt invented the first escapement in 1237, citing a drawing of a rope linkage to turn a statue of an angel to follow the sun, found in his notebooks; however, the consensus is that this was not an escapement. 

Astronomer Robertus Anglicus wrote in 1271 that clockmakers were trying to invent an escapement, but had not yet been successful. Records in financial transactions for the construction of clocks point to the late 13th century as the most likely date for when tower clock mechanisms transitioned from water clocks to mechanical escapements. Most sources agree that mechanical escapement clocks existed by 1300.

However, the earliest available description of an escapement was not a verge escapement, but a variation called a &quot;strob&quot; escapement. Described in Richard of Wallingford&#x27;s 1327 manuscript on the clock that he built at the Abbey of St. Albans, this escapement consisted of a pair of escape wheels on the same axle, with alternating radial teeth. The verge rod was suspended between them, with a short crosspiece that rotated first in one direction and then the other as the staggered teeth pushed past. Although no other example is known, it is possible that this was the first clock escapement design.

The verge became the standard escapement used in all other early clocks and watches, and remained the only known escapement for 400 years. Its performance was limited by friction and recoil, but most importantly, the early balance wheels used in verge escapements, known as the &quot;foliot&quot;, lacked a balance spring and thus had no natural &quot;beat&quot;, severely limiting their timekeeping accuracy.

A great leap in the accuracy of escapements happened after 1657, due to the invention of the pendulum and the addition of the balance spring to the balance wheel, which made the timekeepers in both clocks and watches harmonic oscillators. The resulting improvement in timekeeping accuracy enabled greater focus on the accuracy of the escapement. The next two centuries, the &quot;golden age&quot; of mechanical horology, saw the invention of over 300 escapement designs, although only about ten of these were ever widely used in clocks and watches.

The invention of the crystal oscillator and the quartz clock in the 1920s, which became the most accurate clock by the 1930s, shifted technological research in timekeeping to electronic methods, and escapement design ceased to play a role in advancing timekeeping precision.

==Reliability==
The reliability of an escapement depends on the quality of workmanship and the level of maintenance given. A poorly constructed or poorly maintained escapement will cause problems. The escapement must accurately convert the oscillations of the pendulum or balance wheel into rotation of the clock or watch gear train, and it must deliver enough energy to the pendulum or balance wheel to maintain its oscillation.

In many escapements, the unlocking of the escapement involves sliding motion; for example, in the animation shown above, the pallets of the anchor slide against the escapement wheel teeth as the pendulum swings. The pallets are often made of very hard materials such as polished stone (for example, artificial ruby), but even so, they normally require lubrication. Since lubricating oil degrades over time due to evaporation, dust, and oxidation, periodic re-lubrication is needed. If this is not done, the timepiece may work unreliably or stop altogether, and the escapement components may be subjected to rapid wear. The increased reliability of modern watches is due primarily to the higher-quality oils used for lubrication. Lubricant lifetimes can be greater than five years in a high-quality watch.

Some escapements avoid sliding friction, such as the grasshopper escapement of John Harrison in the 18th century. These designs may avoid the need for lubrication in the escapement (though it does not obviate the requirement for lubrication of other parts of the gear train).

==Accuracy==
The accuracy of a mechanical clock is dependent on the accuracy of the timing device. If this is a pendulum, then the pendulum&#x27;s period of swing determines the accuracy. If the pendulum rod is made of metal, it will expand and contract with heat, lengthening or shortening the pendulum; this changes the time taken for a swing. Special alloys are used in expensive pendulum-based clocks to minimize this distortion. The degrees of arc in which a pendulum may swing varies; highly accurate pendulum-based clocks have very small arcs in order to minimize the circular error.

Pendulum-based clocks can achieve outstanding accuracy. Even into the 20th century, pendulum-based clocks were reference timepieces in laboratories.

Escapements play a big part in accuracy as well. The precise point in the pendulum&#x27;s travel at which impulse is supplied will affect how closely to time the pendulum will swing. Ideally, the impulse should be evenly distributed on either side of the lowest point of the pendulum&#x27;s swing. This is called &quot;being in beat.&quot; This is because pushing a pendulum when it is moving towards mid-swing makes it gain, whereas pushing it while it is moving away from mid-swing makes it lose. If the impulse is evenly distributed then it gives energy to the pendulum without changing the time of its swing.

The pendulum&#x27;s period depends slightly on the size of the swing. If the amplitude changes from 4° to 3°, the period of the pendulum will decrease by about 0.013 percent, which translates into a gain of about 12 seconds per day. This is caused by the restoring force on the pendulum being circular not linear; thus, the period of the pendulum is only approximately linear in the regime of the small angle approximation. To be time-independent, the path must be cycloidal. To minimize the effect with amplitude, pendulum swings are kept as small as possible.

As a rule, whatever the method of impulse, the action of the escapement should have the smallest effect on the oscillator that can be achieved. This effect, which all escapements have to a larger or smaller degree, is known as the &quot;escapement error&quot;.

Any escapement with sliding friction will need lubrication, but as this deteriorates the friction will increase, and, perhaps, insufficient power will be transferred to the timing device. If the timing device is a pendulum, the increased frictional forces will decrease the Q factor, increasing the resonance band, and decreasing its precision. For spring-driven clocks, the impulse force applied by the spring changes as the spring is unwound, following Hooke&#x27;s law. For gravity-driven clocks, the impulse force also increases as the driving weight falls and more chain suspends the weight from the gear train; in practice, however, this effect is only seen in large public clocks, and it can be avoided by a closed-loop chain.

Watches and smaller clocks do not use pendulums as the timing device. Instead, they use a balance spring: a fine spring connected to a metal balance wheel that oscillates (rotates back and forth). Most modern mechanical watches have a working frequency of 3–4 Hz (oscillations per second) or 6–8 beats per second (21,600–28,800 beats per hour; bph). Faster or slower speeds are used in some watches (33,600bph, or 19,800bph). The working frequency depends on the balance spring&#x27;s stiffness (spring constant); to keep time, the stiffness should not vary with temperature. Consequently, balance springs use sophisticated alloys; in this area, watchmaking is still advancing. As with the pendulum, the escapement must provide a small kick each cycle to keep the balance wheel oscillating. Also, the same lubrication problem occurs over time; the watch will lose accuracy (typically it will speed up) when the escapement lubrication starts to fail.

Pocket watches were the predecessor of modern wristwatches. Pocket watches, being in the pocket, were usually in a vertical orientation. Gravity causes some loss of accuracy as it magnifies over time any lack of symmetry in the weight of the balance. The &quot;tourbillon&quot; was invented to minimize this: the balance and spring are put in a cage that rotates (typically but not necessarily, once a minute), smoothing gravitational distortions. This very clever and sophisticated clockwork is a prized complication in wristwatches, even though the natural movement of the wearer tends to smooth gravitational influences anyway.

The most accurate commercially produced mechanical clock was the electromechanical Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock invented by W. H. Shortt in 1921, which had an uncertainty of about 1 second per year. The most accurate mechanical clock to date is probably the electromechanical Littlemore Clock, built by noted archaeologist E. T. Hall in the 1990s. In Hall&#x27;s paper, he reports an uncertainty of 3 parts in 109 measured over 100 days (an uncertainty of about 0.02 seconds over that period). Both of these clocks are electromechanical clocks: they use a pendulum as the timekeeping element, but electrical power rather than a mechanical gear train to supply energy to the pendulum.

==Mechanical escapements==

Since 1658 when the introduction of the pendulum and balance spring made accurate timepieces possible, it has been estimated that more than three hundred different mechanical escapements have been devised, but only about 10 have seen widespread use. These are described below. In the 20th century, electric timekeeping methods replaced mechanical clocks and watches, so escapement design became a little-known curiosity.

===Verge escapement===

The earliest mechanical escapement, from the late 1200s, was the verge escapement, also known as the crown-wheel escapement. It was used in the first mechanical clocks and was originally controlled by a foliot, a horizontal bar with weights at either end. The escapement consists of an escape wheel shaped somewhat like a crown, with pointed teeth sticking axially out of the side, oriented horizontally. In front of the crown wheel is a vertical shaft, attached to the foliot at the top, which carries two metal plates (pallets) sticking out like flags from a flag pole, oriented about ninety degrees apart, so only one engages the crown wheel teeth at a time. As the wheel turns, one tooth pushes against the upper pallet, rotating the shaft and the attached foliot. As the tooth pushes past the upper pallet, the lower pallet swings into the path of the teeth on the other side of the wheel. A tooth catches on the lower pallet, rotating the shaft back the other way, and the cycle repeats. A disadvantage of the escapement was that each time a tooth landed on a pallet, the momentum of the foliot pushed the crown wheel backward a short distance before the force of the wheel reversed the motion. This is called &quot;recoil&quot; and was a source of wear and inaccuracy.

The verge was the only escapement used in clocks and watches for 350 years. In spring-driven clocks and watches, it required a fusee to even out the force of the mainspring. It was used in the first pendulum clocks for about 50 years after the pendulum clock was invented in 1656. In a pendulum clock, the crown wheel and staff were oriented horizontally, and the pendulum was hung from the staff. However, the verge is the most inaccurate of the common escapements, and after the pendulum was introduced in the 1650s, the verge began to be replaced by other escapements, being abandoned only by the late 1800s. By this time, the fashion for thin watches had required that the escape wheel be made very small, amplifying the effects of wear, and when a watch of this period is wound up today, it will often be found to run very fast, gaining many hours per day.

===Cross-beat escapement===
In 1584 Jost Bürgi invented the cross-beat escapement, a variation of the verge escapement that had two foliots that rotated in opposite directions. According to contemporary accounts, his clocks achieved remarkable accuracy of within a minute per day, two orders of magnitude better than other clocks of the time. However, this improvement was probably not due to the escapement itself, but rather to better workmanship and his invention of the remontoire, a device that isolated the escapement from changes in drive force. Without a balance spring, the cross-beat would have been no more isochronous than the verge.
=== Galileo&#x27;s escapement ===

Galileo&#x27;s escapement is a design for a clock escapement, invented around 1637 by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei. It was the earliest design of a pendulum clock. Since he was blind by then, Galileo described the device to his son, who drew a sketch of it. The son began construction of a prototype, but both he and Galileo died before it was completed.

===Anchor escapement===

Invented around 1657 by Robert Hooke, the anchor (see animation) quickly superseded the verge to become the standard escapement used in pendulum clocks through to the 19th century. Its advantage was that it reduced the wide pendulum swing angles of the verge to 3–6°, making the pendulum nearly isochronous, and allowing the use of longer, slower-moving pendulums, which used less energy. The anchor is responsible for the long narrow shape of most pendulum clocks, and for the development of the grandfather clock, the first anchor clock to be sold commercially, which was invented around 1680 by William Clement, who disputed credit for the escapement with Hooke.

The anchor consists of an escape wheel with pointed, backward slanted teeth, and an &quot;anchor&quot;-shaped piece pivoted above it which rocks from side to side, linked to the pendulum. The anchor has slanted pallets on the arms which alternately catch on the teeth of the escape wheel, receiving impulses. Operation is mechanically similar to the verge escapement, and it has two of the verge&#x27;s disadvantages: (1) The pendulum is constantly being pushed by an escape wheel tooth throughout its cycle, and is never allowed to swing freely, which disturbs its isochronism, and (2) it is a &quot;recoil&quot; escapement; the anchor pushes the escape wheel backward during part of its cycle. This causes backlash, increased wear in the clock&#x27;s gears, and inaccuracy. These problems were eliminated in the deadbeat escapement, which slowly replaced the anchor in precision clocks.
===Deadbeat escapement===

The Graham or deadbeat escapement was an improvement of the anchor escapement first made by Thomas Tompion to a design by Richard Towneley in 1675, although it is often credited to Tompion&#x27;s successor George Graham who popularized it in 1715. In the anchor escapement the swing of the pendulum pushes the escape wheel backward during part of its cycle. This &quot;recoil&quot; disturbs the motion of the pendulum, causing inaccuracy, and reverses the direction of the gear train, causing backlash and introducing high loads into the system, leading to friction and wear. The main advantage of the deadbeat is that it eliminated recoil.

In the deadbeat, the pallets have a second curved &quot;locking&quot; face on them, concentric about the pivot on which the anchor turns. During the extremities of the pendulum&#x27;s swing, the escape wheel tooth rests against this locking face, providing no impulse to the pendulum, which prevents recoil. Near the bottom of the pendulum&#x27;s swing, the tooth slides off the locking face onto the angled &quot;impulse&quot; face, giving the pendulum a push, before the pallet releases the tooth. The deadbeat was first used in precision regulator clocks, but because of its greater accuracy it superseded the anchor in the 19th century. It is used in almost all modern pendulum clocks, except for tower clocks, which often use gravity escapements.
===Pin wheel escapement===

Invented around 1741 by Louis Amant, this version of a deadbeat escapement can be made quite rugged. Instead of using teeth, the escape wheel has round pins that are stopped and released by a scissors-like anchor. This escapement, which is also called the Amant escapement or (in Germany) the Mannhardt escapement, is used quite often in tower clocks.
===Detent escapement===
The detent or chronometer escapement was used in marine chronometers, although some precision watches during the 18th and 19th centuries also used it. It was considered the most accurate of the balance wheel escapements before the beginning of the 20th century, when lever escapement chronometers began to outperform them in competition. The early form was invented by Pierre Le Roy in 1748, who created a pivoted detent type of escapement, though this was theoretically deficient. The first effective design of detent escapement was invented by John Arnold around 1775, but with the detent pivoted. This escapement was modified by Thomas Earnshaw in 1780 and patented by Wright (for whom he worked) in 1783; however, as depicted in the patent it was unworkable. Arnold also designed a spring detent escapement but, with improved design, Earnshaw&#x27;s version eventually prevailed as the basic idea underwent several minor modifications during the last decade of the 18th century. The final form appeared around 1800, and this design was used until mechanical chronometers became obsolete in the 1970s.

The detent is a detached escapement; it allows the balance wheel to swing undisturbed during most of its cycle, except the brief impulse period, which is only given once per cycle (every other swing). Because the driving escape wheel tooth moves almost parallel to the pallet, the escapement has little friction and does not need oiling. For these reasons among others, the detent was considered the most accurate escapement for balance wheel timepieces. John Arnold was the first to use the detent escapement with an overcoil balance spring (patented 1782), and with this improvement his watches were the first truly accurate pocket timekeepers, keeping time to within 1 or 2 seconds per day. These were produced from 1783 onwards.

However, the escapement had disadvantages that limited its use in watches: it was fragile and required skilled maintenance; it was not self-starting, so if the watch was jarred in use so the balance wheel stopped, it would not start up again; and it was harder to manufacture in volume. Therefore, the self-starting lever escapement became dominant in watches.

===Cylinder escapement===
The horizontal or cylinder escapement, invented by Thomas Tompion in 1695 and perfected by George Graham in 1726, was one of the escapements which replaced the verge escapement in pocketwatches after 1700. A major attraction was that it was much thinner than the verge, allowing watches to be made fashionably slim. Clockmakers found it suffered from excessive wear, so it was not much used during the 18th century, except in a few high-end watches with cylinders made from ruby. The French solved this problem by making the cylinder and escape wheel of hardened steel, and the escapement was used in large numbers in inexpensive French and Swiss pocketwatches and small clocks from the mid-19th to the 20th century. 

Rather than pallets, the escapement uses a cutaway cylinder on the balance wheel shaft, which the escape teeth enter one by one. Each wedge-shaped tooth impulses the balance wheel by pressure on the cylinder edge as it enters, is held inside the cylinder as it turns, and impulses the wheel again as it leaves out the other side. The wheel usually had 15 teeth and impulsed the balance over an angle of 20° to 40° in each direction. It is a frictional rest escapement, with the teeth in contact with the cylinder over the whole balance wheel cycle, and so was not as accurate as &quot;detached&quot; escapements like the lever, and the high friction forces caused excessive wear and necessitated more frequent cleaning.

===Duplex escapement===
The duplex watch escapement was invented by Robert Hooke around 1700, improved by Jean Baptiste Dutertre and Pierre Le Roy, and put in final form by Thomas Tyrer, who patented it in 1782.
The early forms had two escape wheels. The duplex escapement was difficult to make but achieved much higher accuracy than the cylinder escapement—it could equal that of the (early) lever escapement, and when carefully made was almost as good as a detent escapement.

It was used in quality English pocketwatches from about 1790 to 1860,

 and in the Waterbury, a cheap American &quot;everyman&#x27;s watch&quot;, during 1880–1898.
In the duplex, as in the chronometer escapement to which it has similarities, the balance wheel only receives an impulse during one of the two swings in its cycle.

The escape wheel has two sets of teeth (hence the name &quot;duplex&quot;); long locking teeth project from the side of the wheel, and short impulse teeth stick up axially from the top. The cycle starts with a locking tooth resting against the ruby disk. As the balance wheel swings counterclockwise through its center position, the notch in the ruby disk releases the tooth. As the escape wheel turns, the pallet is in just the right position to receive a push from an impulse tooth. Then the next locking tooth drops onto the ruby roller and stays there while the balance wheel completes its cycle and swings back clockwise, and the process repeats. During the clockwise swing, the impulse tooth falls momentarily into the ruby roller notch again but is not released.

The duplex is technically a &quot;frictional rest&quot; escapement; the tooth resting against the roller adds some friction to the balance wheel during its swing but this is very minimal. As in the chronometer, there is little sliding friction during impulse since pallet and impulse tooth are moving almost parallel, so little lubrication is needed.

However, it lost favor to the lever escapement; its tight tolerances and sensitivity to shock made duplex watches unsuitable for active people. Like the chronometer, it is not self-starting and is vulnerable to &quot;setting&quot;—if a sudden jar stops the balance during its clockwise swing, it cannot restart.
===Lever escapement===

The lever escapement, invented by Thomas Mudge in 1750, has been used in the vast majority of watches since the 19th century. Its advantages are (1) it is a &quot;detached&quot; escapement, in which (unlike the cylinder or duplex escapements) the balance wheel is only in contact with the lever during the short impulse period when it swings through its centre position and swings freely the rest of its cycle, increasing accuracy; and (2) it is a self-starting escapement, so if the balance wheel stops because the watch is shaken, it will automatically start again. The original form was the rack lever escapement, in which the lever and the balance wheel were always in contact via a gear rack on the lever. Later, it was realized that all the teeth from the gears could be removed except one, and this created the detached lever escapement. British watchmakers used the English detached lever, in which the lever was at right angles to the balance wheel. Later Swiss and American manufacturers used the inline lever, in which the lever is inline between the balance wheel and the escape wheel; this is the form used in modern watches. In 1798, Louis Perron invented an inexpensive, less accurate form called the pin-pallet escapement, which was used in cheap &quot;dollar watches&quot; in the early 20th century and is still used in cheap alarm clocks and kitchen timers.
===Grasshopper escapement===

A rare but interesting mechanical escapement is John Harrison&#x27;s grasshopper escapement invented in 1722. In this escapement, the pendulum is driven by two hinged arms (pallets). As the pendulum swings, the end of one arm catches on the escape wheel and drives it slightly backwards; this releases the other arm which moves out of the way to allow the escape wheel to pass. When the pendulum swings back again, the other arm catches the wheel, pushes it back and releases the first arm, and so on. The grasshopper escapement has been used in very few clocks since Harrison&#x27;s time. Grasshopper escapements made by Harrison in the 18th century are still operating. Most escapements wear far more quickly, and waste far more energy. However, like other early escapements, the grasshopper impulses the pendulum throughout its cycle; it is never allowed to swing freely, causing error due to variations in drive force, and 19th-century clockmakers found it uncompetitive with more detached escapements like the deadbeat. Nevertheless, with enough care in construction it is capable of accuracy. A modern experimental grasshopper clock, the Burgess Clock B, had a measured error of only of a second during 100 running days. After two years of operation, it had an error of only ±0.5 sec, after barometric correction.
===Gravity escapement===
A gravity escapement uses a small weight or a weak spring to give an impulse directly to the pendulum. The earliest form consisted of two arms which were pivoted very close to the suspension spring of the pendulum with one arm on each side of the pendulum. Each arm carried a small deadbeat pallet with an angled plane leading to it. When the pendulum lifted one arm far enough, its pallet would release the escape wheel. Almost immediately, another tooth on the escape wheel would start to slide up the angle face on the other arm thereby lifting the arm. It would reach the pallet and stop. The other arm meanwhile was still in contact with the pendulum and coming down again to a point lower than it had started from. This lowering of the arm provides the impulse to the pendulum.

The design was developed steadily from the middle of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. It eventually became the escapement of choice for turret clocks, because their wheel trains are subjected to large variations in drive force caused by the large exterior hands, with their varying wind, snow, and ice loads. Since in a gravity escapement, the drive force from the wheel train does not itself impel the pendulum but merely resets the weights that provide the impulse, the escapement is not affected by variations in drive force.

The &quot;double three-legged gravity escapement&quot; shown here is a form of escapement first devised by a barrister named Bloxam and later improved by Lord Grimthorpe. It is the standard for all accurate tower clocks. In the animation, the two &quot;gravity arms&quot; are coloured blue and red. The two three-legged escape wheels are also coloured blue and red. They work in two parallel planes so that the blue wheel only impacts the locking block on the blue arm and the red wheel only impacts the red arm. In a real escapement, these impacts give rise to loud audible &quot;ticks&quot; (indicated in the animation by the appearance of an asterisk (*) beside the locking blocks). The three black lifting pins are key to the operation of the escapement. They cause the weighted gravity arms to be raised by an amount indicated by the pair of parallel lines on each side of the escapement. This gain in potential energy is the energy given to the pendulum on each cycle. For the Trinity College Cambridge Clock, a mass of around 50 grams is lifted through 3 mm each 1.5 seconds, which works out to 1 mW of power. The driving power from the falling weight is about 12 mW, so there is a substantial excess of power used to drive the escapement. Much of this energy is dissipated in the acceleration and deceleration of the frictional &quot;fly&quot; attached to the escape wheels. 
The great clock in Elizabeth Tower at Westminster that rings London&#x27;s Big Ben uses a double three-legged gravity escapement.
===Coaxial escapement===

Invented around 1974 and patented in 1980 by British watchmaker George Daniels, the coaxial escapement is one of the few new watch escapements adopted commercially in modern times.

It could be regarded as having its distant origins in the escapement invented by Robert Robin circa 1792, which gives a single impulse in one direction. Yet with the locking achieved by passive lever pallets, the design of the coaxial escapement is more akin to the Fasoldt escapement (another Robin variant), which was invented and patented by the American Charles Fasoldt in 1859.
Both Robin and Fasoldt escapements give impulse in one direction only.

The Fasoldt escapement has a lever with unequal drops; this engages with two escape wheels of differing diameters. The smaller impulse wheel acts on the single pallet at the end of the lever, whilst the pointed lever pallets lock on the larger wheel. The balance engages with and is impelled by the lever through a roller pin and lever fork. The lever &quot;anchor&quot; pallet locks the larger wheel; when this is unlocked, a pallet on the end of the lever is given an impulse by the smaller wheel through the lever fork. The return stroke is &quot;dead&quot;, with the anchor pallets serving only to lock and unlock, impulse being given in one direction through the single lever pallet. As with the duplex, the locking wheel is larger in order to reduce pressure and thus friction.

Daniels&#x27; coaxial escapement, however, achieves a double impulse with passive lever pallets serving only to lock and unlock the larger wheel. On one side, impulse is given by means of the smaller wheel acting on the lever pallet through the roller and impulse pin. On the return, the lever again unlocks the larger wheel, which gives an impulse directly onto an impulse roller on the balance staff.

The main advantage is that this enables both impulses to occur on or around the centre line, with disengaging friction in both directions.
This mode of impulse is in theory superior to the lever escapement, which has engaging friction on the entry pallet. For long, this was recognized as a disturbing influence on the isochronism of the balance.

Purchasers no longer buy mechanical watches primarily for their accuracy, so manufacturers had little interest in investing in the tooling required to manufacture coaxial escapements; although finally, Omega adopted it in 1990.

===Other modern watch escapements===
Since low-cost quartz watches can achieve far greater accuracy than any mechanical watch, improved escapement designs are no longer motivated by practical timekeeping needs but as novelties in the high-end watch market. In an effort to attract publicity, in recent decades some high-end mechanical watchmakers have introduced new escapements. None of these have been adopted by any watchmakers beyond their original creator.

Based on patents initially submitted by Rolex on behalf of inventor Nicolas Déhon, the constant escapement was developed by Girard-Perregaux as working prototypes in 2008 (Déhon was then head of Girard-Perregaux R&amp;D department) and in watches by 2013.

The key component of this escapement is a silicon buckled-blade which stores elastic energy. This blade is flexed to a point close to its unstable state and released with a snap each swing of the balance wheel to give the wheel an impulse, after which it is cocked again by the wheel train. The advantage claimed is that since the blade imparts the same amount of energy to the wheel each release, the balance wheel is isolated from variations in impulse force due to the wheel train and mainspring which cause inaccuracies in conventional escapements. 

Parmigiani Fleurier with its Genequand escapement and Ulysse Nardin with its Ulysse Anchor escapement have taken advantage of the properties of silicon flat springs. The independent watchmaker, De Bethune, has developed a concept where a magnet makes a resonator vibrate at high frequency, replacing the traditional balance spring.

==Electromechanical escapements==
In the late 19th century, electromechanical escapements were developed for pendulum clocks. In these, a switch or phototube energised an electromagnet for a brief section of the pendulum&#x27;s swing. On some clocks, the pulse of electricity that drove the pendulum also drove a plunger to move the gear train.

===Hipp clock===
In 1843, Matthäus Hipp first mentioned a purely mechanical clock being driven by a switch called &quot;echappement à palette&quot;. A varied version of that escapement has been used from the 1860s inside electrically driven pendulum clocks, the so-called &quot;hipp-toggle&quot;. Since the 1870s, in an improved version the pendulum drove a ratchet wheel via a pawl on the pendulum rod, and the ratchet wheel drove the rest of the clock train to indicate the time. The pendulum was not impelled on every swing or even at a set interval of time—it was only impelled when its arc of swing had decayed below a certain level. As well as the counting pawl, the pendulum carried a small vane, known as a Hipp&#x27;s toggle, pivoted at the top, which was completely free to swing. It was placed so that it dragged across a triangular polished block with a vee-groove in the top of it. When the arc of swing of the pendulum was large enough, the vane crossed the groove and swung free on the other side. If the arc was too small the vane never left the far side of the groove, and when the pendulum swung back it pushed the block strongly downwards. The block carried a contact which completed the circuit to the electromagnet which impelled the pendulum. The pendulum was only impelled as required.

This type of clock was widely used as a master clock in large buildings to control numerous slave clocks. Most telephone exchanges used such a clock to control timed events such as were needed to control the setup and charging of telephone calls by issuing pulses of varying durations periodically, such as every second.

=== Synchronome switch ===
Designed in 1895 by Frank Hope-Jones, the Synchronome switch and gravity escapement were the basis for the majority of the Synchronome Company&#x27;s clocks in the 20th century, as well as the basis of the slave pendulum in the Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock. A gathering arm attached to the pendulum moves a 15-tooth count wheel in one position, with a pawl preventing movement in the reverse direction. The wheel has a vane attached which, once per 30-second turn, releases the gravity arm. When the gravity arm falls it pushes against a pallet attached directly to the pendulum. Once the arm has fallen, it makes an electrical contact that energises an electromagnet to reset the gravity arm and acts as the half-minute impulse for the slave clocks.

===Free pendulum clock===
In the 20th century, the English horologist William Hamilton Shortt invented a free pendulum clock, patented in September 1921 and manufactured by the Synchronome Company, with an accuracy of one-hundredth of a second a day. In this system, the timekeeping &quot;master&quot; pendulum—whose rod is made from a special steel-nickel alloy ( Invar) and whose length changes very little with temperature—swings as free of external influence as possible sealed in a vacuum chamber; it does virtually no work. It is in mechanical contact with its escapement for only a fraction of a second every 30 seconds. A secondary &quot;slave&quot; pendulum turns a ratchet, which triggers an electromagnet slightly less than every 30 seconds. This electromagnet releases a gravity lever onto the escapement above the master pendulum. A fraction of a second later (but exactly every 30 seconds), the motion of the master pendulum releases the gravity lever to fall farther. In the process, the gravity lever gives a tiny impulse to the master pendulum, which keeps that pendulum swinging. The gravity lever falls onto a pair of contacts, completing a circuit that (1) energizes a second electromagnet to raise the gravity lever above the master pendulum to its top position, (2) sends a pulse to activate one or more clock dials, and (3) sends a pulse to a synchronizing mechanism that keeps the slave pendulum in step with the master pendulum.

Since it is the slave pendulum that releases the gravity lever, this synchronization is vital to the functioning of the clock. The synchronizing mechanism used a small spring attached to the shaft of the slave pendulum and an electromagnetic armature that would catch the spring if the slave pendulum was running slightly late, thus shortening the period of the slave pendulum for one swing. The slave pendulum was adjusted to run slightly slow, such that on approximately every other synchronization pulse the spring would be caught by the armature.

This form of clock became a standard for use in observatories (roughly 100 such clocks were manufactured) and was the first clock capable of detecting small variations in the speed of Earth&#x27;s rotation.

<doc id="610583" wikidata="Q855949" url="?curid=610583" title="Sinc function">
<text>In mathematics, physics and engineering, the sinc function ( ), denoted by , has two forms, normalized and unnormalized.

{(2k + 1)!}&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, the historical unnormalized sinc function is defined for by
formula_1

Alternatively, the unnormalized sinc function is often called the sampling function, indicated as Sa(&quot;x&quot;).

In digital signal processing and information theory, the normalized sinc function is commonly defined for by
formula_2

In either case, the value at is defined to be the limiting value
formula_3 for all real (the limit can be proven using the squeeze theorem).

The normalization causes the definite integral of the function over the real numbers to equal 1 (whereas the same integral of the unnormalized sinc function has a value of ). As a further useful property, the zeros of the normalized sinc function are the nonzero integer values of .

The normalized sinc function is the Fourier transform of the rectangular function with no scaling. It is used in the concept of reconstructing a continuous bandlimited signal from uniformly spaced samples of that signal.

The only difference between the two definitions is in the scaling of the independent variable (the axis) by a factor of . In both cases, the value of the function at the removable singularity at zero is understood to be the limit value 1. The sinc function is then analytic everywhere and hence an entire function.

The function has also been called the cardinal sine or sine cardinal function. The term &quot;sinc&quot; was introduced by Philip M. Woodward in his 1952 article &quot;Information theory and inverse probability in telecommunication&quot;, in which he said that the function &quot;occurs so often in Fourier analysis and its applications that it does seem to merit some notation of its own&quot;, and his 1953 book &quot;Probability and Information Theory, with Applications to Radar&quot;.
The function itself was first mathematically derived in this form by Lord Rayleigh in his expression (Rayleigh&#x27;s formula) for the zeroth-order spherical Bessel function of the first kind.

== Properties ==
The zero crossings of the unnormalized sinc are at non-zero integer multiples of , while zero crossings of the normalized sinc occur at non-zero integers.

The local maxima and minima of the unnormalized sinc correspond to its intersections with the cosine function. That is, for all points where the derivative of is zero and thus a local extremum is reached. This follows from the derivative of the sinc function:
formula_4

The first few terms of the infinite series for the coordinate of the -th extremum with positive coordinate are 
formula_5
where
formula_6
and where odd lead to a local minimum, and even to a local maximum. Because of symmetry around the axis, there exist extrema with coordinates . In addition, there is an absolute maximum at .

The normalized sinc function has a simple representation as the infinite product:
formula_7

and is related to the gamma function through Euler&#x27;s reflection formula:
formula_8

Euler discovered that
formula_9
and because of the product-to-sum identity

formula_10
Euler&#x27;s product can be recast as a sum
formula_11

The continuous Fourier transform of the normalized sinc (to ordinary frequency) is :
formula_12
where the rectangular function is 1 for argument between − and , and zero otherwise. This corresponds to the fact that the sinc filter is the ideal (brick-wall, meaning rectangular frequency response) low-pass filter.

This Fourier integral, including the special case
formula_13
is an improper integral (see Dirichlet integral) and not a convergent Lebesgue integral, as
formula_14

The normalized sinc function has properties that make it ideal in relationship to interpolation of sampled bandlimited functions:
* It is an interpolating function, i.e., , and for nonzero integer .
* The functions ( integer) form an orthonormal basis for bandlimited functions in the function space , with highest angular frequency (that is, highest cycle frequency ).

Other properties of the two sinc functions include:
* The unnormalized sinc is the zeroth-order spherical Bessel function of the first kind, . The normalized sinc is .
* where is the sine integral, formula_15
* (not normalized) is one of two linearly independent solutions to the linear ordinary differential equation formula_16 The other is , which is not bounded at , unlike its sinc function counterpart.
* Using normalized sinc, formula_17
* formula_18
* formula_19
* formula_20
* The following improper integral involves the (not normalized) sinc function: formula_21

== Relationship to the Dirac delta distribution ==

The normalized sinc function can be used as a &quot;nascent delta function&quot;, meaning that the following weak limit holds:

formula_22

This is not an ordinary limit, since the left side does not converge. Rather, it means that

formula_23

for every Schwartz function, as can be seen from the Fourier inversion theorem.
In the above expression, as , the number of oscillations per unit length of the sinc function approaches infinity. Nevertheless, the expression always oscillates inside an envelope of , regardless of the value of .

This complicates the informal picture of as being zero for all except at the point , and illustrates the problem of thinking of the delta function as a function rather than as a distribution. A similar situation is found in the Gibbs phenomenon.

== Summation ==
All sums in this section refer to the unnormalized sinc function.

The sum of over integer from 1 to equals :

formula_24

The sum of the squares also equals :

formula_25

When the signs of the addends alternate and begin with +, the sum equals :
formula_26

The alternating sums of the squares and cubes also equal :
formula_27

formula_28

== Series expansion ==
The Taylor series of the unnormalized function can be obtained from that of the sine (which also yields its value of 1 at ):
formula_29

The series converges for all . The normalized version follows easily:
formula_30

Euler famously compared this series to the expansion of the infinite product form to solve the Basel problem.

== Higher dimensions ==
The product of 1-D sinc functions readily provides a multivariate sinc function for the square Cartesian grid (lattice): , whose Fourier transform is the indicator function of a square in the frequency space (i.e., the brick wall defined in 2-D space). The sinc function for a non-Cartesian lattice (e.g., hexagonal lattice) is a function whose Fourier transform is the indicator function of the Brillouin zone of that lattice. For example, the sinc function for the hexagonal lattice is a function whose Fourier transform is the indicator function of the unit hexagon in the frequency space. For a non-Cartesian lattice this function can not be obtained by a simple tensor product. However, the explicit formula for the sinc function for the hexagonal, body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic and other higher-dimensional lattices can be explicitly derived using the geometric properties of Brillouin zones and their connection to zonotopes.

For example, a hexagonal lattice can be generated by the (integer) linear span of the vectors
formula_31

Denoting
formula_32
one can derive the sinc function for this hexagonal lattice as
formula_33

This construction can be used to design Lanczos window for general multidimensional lattices.

== Sinhc ==

Some authors, by analogy, define the hyperbolic sine cardinal function.

<text>Be Not Nobody is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton, released on April 30, 2002, through A&amp;M Records.
As of late 2004 the album had sold 1.38 million copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan, and &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported in July 2003 that it had sold 2.3 million worldwide. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine placed Carlton at number twenty-one on its year-end &quot;Top Pop Artists&quot; list for 2002.

&quot;A Thousand Miles&quot; was released as the lead single from the album and reached the top five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number one in Australia and the top ten in the United Kingdom. &quot;Be Not Nobody&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA in June 2002, and platinum in October 2002. &quot;Ordinary Day&quot; charted inside the top forty on the US Hot 100. &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; was remixed and released as the album&#x27;s third and final single in early 2003. After the single&#x27;s release, subsequent pressings of the album contained the remixed single version of the song in place of its original album version. &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; did not appear on the Hot 100 or the UK top seventy-five, but was nominated for a 2003 Teen Choice Award for &quot;Choice Love Song&quot;.
