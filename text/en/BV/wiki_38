<doc id="618219" wikidata="Q7269253" url="?curid=618219" title="Court of quarter sessions">
<text>The courts of quarter sessions or quarter sessions were local courts that were traditionally held at four set times each year in the Kingdom of England from 1388; they were extended to Wales following the Laws in Wales Act 1535. Scotland established quarter sessions in the 17th century. Quarter sessions were also established in Ireland and British colonies overseas.

Quarter sessions generally sat in the seat of each county and county borough, and in numerous non-county boroughs which were entitled to hold their own quarter sessions, although some of the smaller boroughs lost theirs in 1951; these non-county boroughs were mainly, but not exclusively, ancient boroughs.

In 1972, all quarter sessions were abolished in England and Wales with the commencement of the Courts Act 1971, which replaced them and the assizes with a single permanent Crown Court. In Scotland, they survived until 1975, when they were abolished and replaced by district courts and later by justice of the peace courts.

The quarter sessions were named after the quarter days on which they met in England and Wales from 1388. These days were later settled as Epiphany, Easter, Midsummer, and Michaelmas sessions.

==Reputation==

Bentley notes in &quot;English Criminal Justice in the Nineteenth Century&quot; that &quot;the reputation of such courts remained consistently bad throughout the century&quot; due to failure by chairmen to take proper note of evidence, display of open bias against prisoners, and the severity of sentences compared to the assizes. Chairmen of county sessions did not originally have to be legally qualified, though the jurisdiction of county quarter sessions was extended to cover a wider range of offences if they had appointed a legally-qualified chairman. From 1962 it was required that all chairmen had to be legally qualified. Occasionally County Court or High Court judges accepted appointment, as it was a part-time one.

==Jurisdiction==

The quarter sessions generally heard crimes that could not be tried summarily by the justices of the peace without a jury in petty sessions, which were sent up by the process of indictment to be heard in quarter sessions.

The quarter sessions did not have jurisdiction to hear the most serious crimes, most notably those subject to capital punishment or later life imprisonment. These crimes were sent for trial at the periodic assizes.

=== Civil ===
The courts of quarter sessions, throughout, had a narrow civil jurisdiction; however, until the Local Government Act 1888 created elected county councils, they also provided or authorised much major infrastructure and services that needed to span more than one vestry for their respective counties.

Most of such powers were delegated to committees, given specific responsibilities, of members – magistrates. Most of these administrative functions were transferred to county councils when they were established in 1888.

These functions and powers included:

*Supervision of how the vestries (of each poor law parish) were administering the English Poor Laws before 1834
*Repair of roads and bridges (and appointment of county surveyors)
*Highway diversions and closure (stopping up of rights of way)
*Construction and maintenance of county buildings
**Administration of the county gaol(s)
*Supervision of public and private lunatic asylums
*Supervision and organisation of petty sessions (more local sittings of the magistrates themselves)
*Licensing of public houses
*The county militia, particularly per the Militia Act 1802 to contribute to an Old Militia to number, that year, 51,489 men in England and Wales and at times a &quot;Supplementary Militia&quot; of half as many again which could be raised with Parliamentary approval.
*The police
*Managing their finances mainly by setting county rates (see Rates in the United Kingdom), also borrowing and repaying when and how the law permitted such as against the security of a toll bridge.

==Organisation==

The quarter sessions in each county were made up of two or more justices of the peace, presided over by a chairman, who sat with a jury. County boroughs and other boroughs entitled to their own quarter sessions had a single recorder instead of a bench of justices.

Every court of quarter sessions had a clerk called the clerk of the peace. For county quarter sessions, this person was appointed by the &quot;custos rotulorum&quot; of the county – the justice of the peace for the county charged with custody of its rolls and records. There was a large fee income for the clerk, and he was usually a friend or relative of the &quot;custos.&quot; The clerk rarely discharged the duties of the office himself, but appointed a solicitor to act as his deputy in return for a share of the fees. After 1852, payment by salary was gradually brought in instead of fees.

In some counties there were multiple quarter sessions, quite apart from those held by the county boroughs and boroughs with their own quarter sessions: for example, Yorkshire had its North Riding, West Riding, and East Riding; whilst Northamptonshire&#x27;s Soke of Peterborough was administered separately. These divisions were carried over into the administrative counties that county councils covered.

=== Non-county borough quarter sessions ===
The non-county boroughs of then-fewer than 20,000 residents lost their own quarter sessions on 1 October 1951.

*Bideford
*Bridgnorth
*Carmarthen
*Chichester
*Faversham
*Haverfordwest
*Hythe

*Liberty of Ripon
*Rye
*Saffron Walden
*Sandwich
*South Molton
*Stamford
*Sudbury
*Tenterden
*Thetford
*Tiverton
*Warwick
*Wenlock
That Act also created a separate quarter sessions for the Isle of Wight.

The more populous non-county boroughs continued to hold their own quarter sessions, until they were abolished in 1972 by the Courts Act 1971.

=== Australia ===
Quarter Sessions were also held in the colony of New South Wales.

=== Canada ===

==== Lower Canada ====
The courts of quarter sessions of the peace was created in August 1764 and headed by a chairman in each district. In Montreal, the Governor of Montreal was replaced with the Court of Quarter Sessions Chairman.

List of quarter session courts in Lower Canada from 1763 to 1790:

* Montreal District
* Quebec District
* Trois-Rivières District

In 1791, 27 districts were created to replace the role of the three founding districts. In 1832 when Montreal was incorporated as a city the role of the Mayor of Montreal replaced the quarter sessions chairman and that of the court by Montreal City Council.

==== Upper Canada ====
A Court of Quarter Sessions was held four times a year in each district to oversee the administration of the district and deal with legal cases in the Province of Upper Canada (later Province of Canada West after 1841). It was created in 1788 and remained in effect until 1849 when local governments and courts were assigned to county governments to replace the district system created in the 1780s.

List of Quarter Session courts in Upper Canada and later in Canada West:

* Lunenburgh District 1788–1792 – sat at New Johnstown (present-day Cornwall, Ontario)
** Eastern District, Upper Canada 1792–1849
*** Johnstown District, Upper Canada 1798–1849 – carved out from Eastern District

=== India and Malaysia ===
In India, Bangladesh and Malaysia, the quarter sessions have evolved into permanent Sessions Courts.

=== United Kingdom ===

==== Ireland ====

There were quarter sessions courts for each county and county of a city or town as well as the boroughs of Derry, Kinsale, and Youghal. The recorder of the court sat alone. In Dublin city, which had no assizes, the quarter sessions court had cognizance of all crimes committed within the city&#x27;s boundaries except treason. The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 abolished many city and borough courts, but Dublin, Cork, Galway and Carrickfergus retained their courts of quarter sessions.

In 1867, the Attorney-General for Ireland, Hedges Eyre Chatterton, issued guidelines to regulate which cases ought to be tried at assizes rather than quarter sessions: treason, murder, treason felony, rape, perjury, assault with intent to murder, party processions, election riots, and all offences of a political or insurrectionary character.

Quarter Sessions were abolished in the Irish Free State under the Courts of Justice Act 1924. Their jurisdiction (together with that of the assizes and the county courts) was largely transferred to the Circuit Court.

==== Scotland ====
Quarter sessions were established in Scotland by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland in 1661 (cap. 38), which directed justices of the peace to meet together in each county on the first Tuesday of March, May and August, and the last Tuesday of October. Often quarter sessions were delayed, in which case they met as general sessions. Quarter sessions were abolished alongside other local courts by the District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975, which moved justices of the peace to sit in a uniform series of district courts, since replaced by justice of the peace courts.

=== United States ===
Courts of quarter sessions also existed in North American colonies and were sometimes known as courts of general sessions. When the United States became an independent country, the Courts of General Sessions became independent of those Britain and were gradually replaced by other court systems, although the name &quot;Court of Quarter Sessions&quot; or &quot;quarterly court&quot; was retained for some county legislative bodies in some jurisdictions.

In Pennsylvania, the courts of general sessions continued until the constitution of that Commonwealth was rewritten in 1968 and the courts&#x27; jurisdiction was placed under the pre-existing courts of common pleas in each county.

In New York, the Court of Quarter Sessions was established in October 17, 1683, by the first Assembly in New York. It had jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters until 1691, when it was restricted to felony crimes not punishable by death or life imprisonment. The court was abolished in all counties of New York except New York County (now Manhattan). In New York County, the Court of General Sessions continued until 1962 when its scope devolved to the New York Supreme Court (a trial-level court of general jurisdiction not to be confused with the highest court of the New York system, which is called the New York Court of Appeals). At the time when it was abolished, the Court of General Sessions of New York County was the oldest criminal court in the United States.

In the Northwest Territory, Governor Arthur St. Clair modeled county government on that of Pennsylvania. In each county, a court of quarter sessions of the peace, composed of three or more justices of the peace, served as the administrative and fiscal board of the county. In 1804, after Ohio became a state, the courts of quarter sessions of the peace were replaced by boards of county commissioners.

<doc id="618221" wikidata="Q1249076" url="?curid=618221" title="Quadrans">
<text>The quadrans () or teruncius () was a low-value Roman bronze coin worth one quarter of an &quot;as&quot;. The &quot;quadrans&quot; was issued from the beginning of cast bronze coins during the Roman Republic, showing three pellets representing three unciae as a mark of value. The obverse type, after some early variations, featured the bust of Hercules, while the reverse featured the prow of a galley. Coins with the same value were issued from other cities in Central Italy, using a cast process.

After BC, when bronze coinage was reduced to the semuncial standard, the &quot;quadrans&quot; became the lowest-valued coin in production. Surviving &quot;quadrantes&quot; from this period (though that name is not shown on the coins) typically have weights between 1.5 grams and 4 grams, perhaps depending in part on the alloy or metals contained. It was produced sporadically until the time of Antoninus Pius (AD 138–161). Unlike other coins during the Roman Empire, the &quot;quadrans&quot; rarely bore the image of the emperor, due to its small size.

The Greek word for the &quot;quadrans&quot; was κοδράντης &quot;(kodrantes)&quot;, which was translated in the King James Version of the Bible as &quot;farthing&quot; (which itself means fourth- + -ing). In the New Testament a coin equal to one half the Attic chalcus was worth about 3/8 of a cent. In the Gospel of Mark, when a poor widow gave two mites or λεπτά (&quot;lepta&quot;) to the Temple Treasury, the gospel writer noted that this amounted to one &quot;quadrans&quot;.

<doc id="618223" wikidata="Q6052095" url="?curid=618223" title="International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment">
<text>The International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (or MICE) is a high-energy physics experiment at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The experiment is a recognized CERN experiment (RE11). MICE is designed to demonstrate ionization cooling of muons. This is a process whereby the emittance of a beam is reduced in order to reduce the beam size, so that more muons can be accelerated in smaller-aperture accelerators and with fewer focussing magnets. This might enable the construction of high-intensity muon accelerators, which can be used in, for example, a neutrino factory or muon collider.

MICE will reduce the transverse emittance of a muon beam over a single 7-meter cooling cell and measure that reduction. The original MICE design was based on a scheme outlined in Feasibility Study II. It was revised significantly in 2014. Pions will be produced from a target in the ISIS neutron source and transported along a beamline where most will decay to muons before entering MICE. Cooling is tested with lithium hydride (LiH) crystals or liquid hydrogen (LH2) cells; magnets are used to focus and analyze the muon beam. MICE will measure cooling performance over a range of beam momenta between about 150 and 250 MeV/c.

== Beamline ==
The MICE muon beamline provides a low-intensity muon beam for MICE. Pions will be transported from a target dipping into the fringe of the ISIS proton beam, through a pion decay channel, into a muon transport line, and then into MICE. For efficient use of muons, it is desirable to have a reasonably good match between the transport beamline and the cooling channel, with selection performed in analysis. Also, the beamline must suppress non-muon events from entering the cooling channel. A beam rate of a few hundred muons per second is expected.

== Experiment setup ==
MICE combines systems to identify, track, steer, and cool muons.

To reject background from pions and electrons, Cerenkov detectors and time-of-flight detectors are the outermost components of the experiment. A calorimeter at the end distinguishes electrons from muons.

The muon emittance is measured with scintillating-fibre tracking detectors in a 4-Tesla magnetic field both before and after the main cooling cell. A diffuser can be placed in front of the first tracking detector to study the cooling of muon beams with larger emittance.

The main cooling cell consists of a secondary LiH absorber, a radio frequency cavity (RF cavity), coils to focus the beam onto the central main absorber (LiH or LH2), magnet coils to focus the beam leaving the main absorber, a second RF cavity, and another secondary LiH absorber.

While the secondary absorbers contribute to cooling, their main purpose is to stop electrons released in the RF cavities. The RF cavities are designed to accelerate the muons. As they cannot be synchronized with the incoming muons, some muons will be accelerated while others will be decelerated. The time of flight measurements allow a calculation of the electric field that the muons experienced in the cavities.

The baseline main absorber is a LiH disk thick. Alternatively, a liquid hydrogen vessel can be used.

=== Detectors ===
Muons pass through the cooling channel one-by-one. The muons&#x27; phase space coordinates will be measured by time-of-flight scintillators and scintillating fibre tracking detectors upstream and downstream of the cooling channel. Muons will be distinguished from other particles in the beam using a combination of the spectrometers and the so-called Particle Identification (PID) detectors, three time-of-flight scintillators, a Cerenkov detector, and a calorimeter.

== Status ==
As of 2017, MICE is taking data, and upgrades to a longer cooling cell are considered.

<doc id="618227" wikidata="Q1051902" url="?curid=618227" title="Superpartner">
<text>In particle physics, a superpartner (also sparticle) is a class of hypothetical elementary particles predicted by supersymmetry, which, among other applications, is one of the well-studied ways to extend the standard model of high-energy physics.

When considering extensions of the Standard Model, the &quot;s-&quot; prefix from &quot;sparticle&quot; is used to form names of superpartners of the Standard Model fermions (sfermions), e.g. the stop squark. The superpartners of Standard Model bosons have an &quot;-ino&quot; (bosinos) appended to their name, e.g. gluino, the set of all gauge superpartners are called the gauginos.

== Theoretical predictions ==
According to the supersymmetry theory, each fermion should have a partner boson, the fermion&#x27;s superpartner, and each boson should have a partner fermion. Exact &quot;unbroken&quot; supersymmetry would predict that a particle and its superpartners would have the same mass. No superpartners of the Standard Model particles have yet been found. This may indicate that supersymmetry is incorrect, or it may also be the result of the fact that supersymmetry is not an exact, &quot;unbroken&quot; symmetry of nature. If superpartners are found, their masses would indicate the scale at which supersymmetry is broken.

For particles that are real scalars (such as an axion), there is a fermion superpartner as well as a second, real scalar field. For axions, these particles are often referred to as axinos and saxions.

In extended supersymmetry there may be more than one superparticle for a given particle. For instance, with two copies of supersymmetry in four dimensions, a photon would have two fermion superpartners and a scalar superpartner.

In zero dimensions it is possible to have supersymmetry, but no superpartners. However, this is the only situation where supersymmetry does not imply the existence of superpartners.

== Recreating superpartners ==
If the supersymmetry theory is correct, it should be possible to recreate these particles in high-energy particle accelerators. Doing so will not be an easy task; these particles may have masses up to a thousand times greater than their corresponding &quot;real&quot; particles.

Some researchers have hoped the Large Hadron Collider at CERN might produce evidence for the existence of superpartner particles. However, as of 2018, no such evidence has been found.

<doc id="618239" wikidata="Q1189890" url="?curid=618239" title="Dentelles de Montmirail">
<text>The Dentelles de Montmirail are a small chain of mountains in Provence in France, in the &quot;département&quot; of Vaucluse, located just to the south of the village of Vaison-la-Romaine.

They are foothills of the highest peak in Provence, Mont Ventoux, which is situated just to the east. The dramatically jagged shape of their peaks was formed by horizontal strata of Jurassic limestone being folded and forced into a nearly upright position and subsequently eroded into sharp-edged ridges and spikes. The highest peak of the Dentelles is St-Amand, at 734 m (2,400 ft). The range, which is about 8 km wide, offers over 600 trails for walking, rock climbing, and mountain biking. The foot of the Dentelles is surrounded by vineyards of the Rhône Valley.

== Etymology ==
Their name &quot;dentelles&quot;, the French word for lace, refers to their shape obtained by erosion, while &quot;Montmirail&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;mons mirabilis&quot; meaning &#x27;admirable mountain&#x27;.

==History==
Located on the territory of the communes of Beaumes-de-Venise, Crestet, Gigondas, La Roque-Alric, Lafare, Le Barroux, Malaucène, Suzette, and Vacqueyras; the Dentelles de Montmirail were an important natural frontier during Antiquity between the tribes of the Memini in the south, and the Voconces in the north.

<text>In high energy physics experiments, an absorber is a block of material used to absorb some of the energy of an incident particle in an experiment. Absorbers can be made of a variety of materials, depending on the purpose; lead, tungsten and liquid hydrogen are common choices. Most absorbers are used as part of a particle detector; particle accelerators use absorbers to reduce the radiation damage on accelerator components.

==Other uses of the same word==
* Absorbers are used in ionization cooling, as in the International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment.
* In solar power, a high degree of efficiency is achieved by using black absorbers which reflect off much less of the incoming energy.
* In sunscreen formulations, ingredients which absorb UVA/UVB rays, such as avobenzone and octyl methoxycinnamate, are known as absorbers. They are contrasted with physical &quot;blockers&quot; of UV radiation such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.

<text>Gustavo Adolfo Polidor González [poh-lee-dor&#x27;] (October 26, 1961 – April 28, 1995) was a Venezuelan professional baseball shortstop who played for the California Angels (1985–88), Milwaukee Brewers (1989–90) and Florida Marlins (1993). He was born in Caracas, Venezuela.

Polidor played infield for the Holyoke Millers of the Eastern League (Holyoke, MA) in 1981 and 1982. In 1981 he hit for a batting average of .248.

His best year was 1987 with the Angels, when he hit for a .263 batting average, with 2 homers and 15 RBI in 137 at bats. After dropping off to .148 in 1988 he was traded to the Brewers. Polidor played in a career-high 79 games in 1989 and was later a member of the Marlins in their 1993 inaugural season.

In his major league career, Polidor batted .207, with 2 home runs, 35 runs batted in, 33 runs scored, 15 doubles and 3 stolen bases.

Polidor made a brief comeback attempt as a replacement player with the Montreal Expos in spring training of 1995. Less than a month later, he was murdered in Caracas as he tried to protect his son from two men who were trying to steal his car. He was 33 years old.

<doc id="618244" wikidata="Q5046646" url="?curid=618244" title="Carrollton, New Orleans">
<text>Carrollton is a historic neighborhood of Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, which includes the Carrollton Historic District, recognized by the Historic District Landmark Commission. It is the part of Uptown New Orleans farthest upriver while still being easily accessible to the French Quarter. It was historically a separate town, laid out in 1833 and incorporated on March 10, 1845. Carrollton was annexed by New Orleans in 1874 (becoming the city&#x27;s 16th and 17th Wards), but it has long retained some elements of distinct identity.

Historically the boundaries of the city of Carrollton were the Mississippi River, the downriver border of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, Fig Street, and Lowerline Street. The area on the river side of Claiborne Avenue is sometimes referred to as &quot;Old Carrollton&quot;. The incorporation of Carrollton created an apparent anomaly in New Orleans street names; Lowerline is upriver from Upperline Street, which was originally the upriver boundary of another suburb annexed in the 1850s.

==City overview==
The main street is broad Carrollton Avenue, lined with Southern live oaks, with the St. Charles Avenue Streetcar running on the &quot;neutral ground&quot; or central median. The streetcar barn is a block off the avenue in Carrollton, on Willow Street, and the landmark Camellia Grill diner is near the corner of St. Charles and Carrollton Avenues. The neoclassical Carrollton Courthouse building is on Carrollton Avenue near the Mississippi; as of 2023, it houses The Carrollton, an upscale assisted living facility. 

The neighborhood and Avenue are pronounced &quot;kaa-rull-ton&quot; or &quot;kaa-ril-tin&quot; by residents and other uptowners, but many people from the downtown parts of New Orleans (especially those born in the mid-20th century and earlier) pronounce the names as &quot;Karl-ton&quot;.

Tulane University and Loyola University New Orleans are just a few blocks below Carrollton, and many students, faculty, and staff live in the area and patronize the businesses there.

In addition to Carrollton Avenue and Saint Charles Avenue, the neighborhood still retains two &quot;neighborhood main streets&quot; of mixed residential and commercial use. Lower Carrollton centers on Maple Street, with many restaurants, coffee houses, bars, and upscale shops. Upper Carrollton has Oak Street, formerly hosting somewhat larger businesses (such as Woolworth); current businesses there range from restaurants and shops to the best known of the neighborhood&#x27;s live music venues, the Maple Leaf Bar.

In the northwest section of Carrollton on Claiborne Avenue is Marsalis Harmony Park (formerly Palmer Park), which hosts some art festivals and moderate sized live music festivals each year. The park has a monument to the Carrolltonians who died in World War I. After Hurricane Katrina, then called Palmer Park, hosted the monthly Mid-City art market, displaced from the more severely damaged Mid-City neighborhood.

The historically predominantly African-American part of Carrollton along the riverfront has been known since the mid-20th century as &quot;Black Pearl.&quot; Mahalia Jackson, the &quot;Queen of Gospel music&quot;, was from the Black Pearl section of Carrollton.

This part of Carrollton is documented as the location of &quot;Rising Sun Hall&quot; near the riverfront in the late 19th century, which seems to have been a building owned and used for meetings of a Social Aid &amp; Pleasure Club, commonly rented out for dances and functions. This is one possible inspiration for the legendary song &quot;The House of the Rising Sun.&quot; Definite connections to gambling or prostitution, if any, are undocumented for either of these buildings, neither of which still exists.

Other smaller, sub-neighborhoods in the area are called Leonidas/Pigeontown, Riverbend, and East Carrollton.

Most of Carrollton has long been ethnically mixed, with &quot;free people of color&quot; owning homes in other parts of the town before the Civil War. Many immigrants from Germany, Ireland, and other parts of the United States settled here in the 19th century.

The post of &quot;mayor of Carrollton&quot; survived to the 1980s, although it was an informal one, representing the concerns of the neighborhood to the New Orleans city council. As of 2004, the United States Postal Service continues to deliver mail addressed to &quot;Carrollton, Louisiana.&quot; The ZIP Code is 70118.

During New Orleans Mardi Gras celebrations, the Krewe of OAK parades through Carrollton. The Phunny Phorty Phellows krewe also holds its &quot;parade&quot; in Carrollton, throwing beads from the streetcar to usher in the parades season on what is colloquially known as Twelfth Night, the Epiphany, January 6.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
New Orleans Public Schools and the Recovery School District serve Carrollton.

Prominent in the area is the Carrollton Courthouse, the former courthouse for the city of Carrollton (located at 719 South Carrollton Avenue). Designed by prominent New Orleans architect Henry Howard, who also designed many other notable buildings around Louisiana including Nottoway Plantation and Madewood Plantation, and completed in 1855, the site served as the courthouse for Carrollton and Jefferson Parish until the town was annexed onto New Orleans in 1874. Since then, the building has housed McDonogh 23 elementary school, Ben Franklin Senior High School, Lusher Elementary School&#x27;s 6-8 extension (now Lusher Charter School), and Audubon Charter School. The building was vacant from 2013 until 2023, when The Carrollton, an upscale assisted living facility, was opened.

There was a private school named the Carrollton Private School, founded to avoid racial integration in the 1950s. The school campus was located on Willow Street at corner of Monroe Street. Grades 1 thru 8.

In 2016 the board of Lycée Français de la Nouvelle-Orléans approved plans to ask to open a campus at the former James Weldon Johnson Elementary School in Carrollton. The request was approved in March 2017. That building temporarily housed Sophie B. Wright Charter School from 2013, until 2016.

===Public libraries===
The New Orleans Public Library operates the Nix Branch Library in Carrollton Riverbend. Robert Morris of the &quot;Uptown Messenger&quot; said that it was a &quot;popular little&quot; library. As of 2011 there was a &quot;secret gardener&quot; who watered the flowers on the library property.

<doc id="618245" wikidata="Q7454788" url="?curid=618245" title="Series (United States currency)">
<text>On banknotes of the United States dollar, the series refers to the year appearing on the obverse of a bill, indicating when the bill&#x27;s design was adopted. The series year does not indicate the exact date a bill was printed; instead, the year indicates the first year that bills of the same design were originally made. For example, $2 bills bearing the series year of 1928 were printed until the early 1950s.

==Before 1928==
The first U.S. banknotes with a series year were the United States Notes of 1869. Before that, paper currency was identified only by the act authorizing it, for example, the act of March 3, 1863. For these bills, the serial number uniquely identified the bill, except for some issues that exceeded one million bills. In that case, the sequence of serial numbers was restarted, and an extra overprint of &#x27;Series 1&#x27; was added to the bill. When one million bills in &#x27;Series 1&#x27; were printed, &#x27;Series 2&#x27; was used, and so on. &#x27;Series 187&#x27; is the highest series number of this sort that was used, on the United States Notes of 1863, in the $5 denomination.

Other notes were identified by the date of issue. Interest-bearing notes were carefully identified as to the date of an issue because they reached maturity a fixed amount of time later. Gold Certificates, issued upon the government receiving a deposit of gold, were dated by hand, and also the depositor was identified. Only the depositor could redeem an early gold certificate. Starting with the Series of 1882, Gold Certificates were made payable to the bearer.

National Bank Notes were given a date as well. However, this was not when the bill was first circulated, but rather when the bill was sent from the federal government to the issuing bank, which could then release it at its convenience. The national currency, issued and unissued, has a series date (corresponding to when the design was last changed) and a release date.

The first series printed by the Federal Reserve was Series 1914. It contained a $5 bill with Abraham Lincoln, a $10 bill with Andrew Jackson, a $20 bill with Grover Cleveland, a $50 bill with Ulysses Grant, and a $100 bill with Benjamin Franklin all of which were large-size notes.

The next series was Series 1918, which contained large-size notes in denominations of $500 bill with John Marshall, the $1,000 bill with Alexander Hamilton, the $5,000 bill with James Madison, and the $10,000 bill with Salmon Chase.

One dollar bills featuring George Washington (which were all Silver Certificates) came in Series 1923, as did red seal United States notes in the ten dollar denomination and blue seal Silver Certificates in the five dollar denomination. Gold Certificates appeared in various series including 1905 and 1906 ($20 notes), 1907 ($10 notes), 1907 ($1000 notes), 1913 ($50 notes), and 1922 ($10, $20, $50, $100, $500, $1,000 notes).

==Since 1928==
Series 1928 was the first series of modern, small-sized notes issued. Since then, the series year has been changed when there is a major design change to a bill; a minor design change is indicated by a letter suffix being added to the series year. Major design changes were rare until 1974 when William E. Simon became Secretary of the Treasury. Before 1974, a change to either the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury or the Treasurer was considered a minor change; after 1974, a new Secretary of the Treasury was considered a major change. (The only exception to this was in 1979, G. William Miller&#x27;s signature appeared on Series 1977A instead of Series 1979.) A change in Treasurer is still considered a minor change. The 2017A series was due to a minor change in production, possibly of the ink used. Changes in design, such as the recent changes to the $20 bill to deter counterfeiting, are still considered major changes.

*When Dorothy Kabis became Treasurer, she was named Dorothy Andrews Elston. Later during her term, she married and changed her signature accordingly, but the signature combination only lasted five months before David M. Kennedy would resign.

**The first printing of 2006 $5 notes (approximately 409 million notes) used the 1996-generation designs. After rumors surfaced that people were bleaching $5 bills to make them resemble $100 bills, the note&#x27;s design was changed as an afterthought and over 2.1 billion bills were produced with the new 2004-generation designs.

***Originally series 2009 $100 notes were scheduled to be released in February 2011 but were delayed because of major printing problems. However, due to intense demand for $100 bills from banks, Series 2006A (with the same Cabral-Paulson signatures as series 2006 notes) was printed, using the series 1996 design instead of the new 2009 design. The redesigned $100 note was finally issued in October 2013 as series 2009A, not series 2009 as the defective notes were dated. The 2009 series notes were sorted and the defective notes were destroyed. Notes found to be acceptable were eventually issued from early 2016. Both series of 2009 and 2009A notes bear the same Rios-Geithner signatures.

<text>Schelte John &quot;Bobby&quot; Bus (born 1956) is an American astronomer and discoverer of minor planets at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawaiʻi and deputy director of NASA&#x27;s Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii, United States.

==Biography==
Bus graduated in 1979 from California Institute of Technology with a BS. In 1999, he received his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Richard Binzel, Bus further added to the knowledge about main-belt asteroids in a spectroscopic survey published in 2002. This project was known as Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey, Phase II or SMASSII, which built on a previous survey of the main-belt asteroids. The visible-wavelength (435–925 nanometers) spectra data was gathered between August 1993 and March 1999. During his studies, he worked under the supervision of Eugene Shoemaker. As of 2017, Bus is an Astronomer at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy and deputy director of NASA&#x27;s Infrared Telescope Facility IRTF.

==Awards and honors==
Asteroid 3254 Bus, which was discovered in 1982 by Edward Bowell, was named in his honor.

==Discoveries==
In 1981, Bus discovered periodic comet 87P/Bus. Since 1975, he has also discovered or co-discovered over a thousand asteroids, including: an Apollo asteroid, 2135 Aristaeus, which will come within 13 lunar distances of the Earth on 30 March 2147; an Amor asteroid; and more than 40 Jupiter trojans. The first of these was 3240 Laocoon, which he co-discovered with Eleanor F. Helin. Bus was also the discoverer of asteroids 5020 Asimov and 4923 Clarke, named after two science fiction writers &quot;(see and )&quot;.

<text>Mango is a character performed by Chris Kattan on the American sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Mango is a male exotic dancer who performed in a strip club. Kattan drew inspiration for the Mango character from actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1930 film &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;. Actors and guest hosts appearing on the program would become infatuated and drawn to Mango. These included David Duchovny, Ellen DeGeneres, Garth Brooks, and Cuba Gooding Jr.

Mango was received favorably in commentary and reflections on the history of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; posited the character helped popularize the word &quot;mango&quot; itself in American households. Comedian Jim Downey placed Mango among the top 10 most frequent sketches in the history of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Michael Musto wrote that Mango was &quot;etched into our memories&quot; by Kattan&#x27;s performances. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed the hosting job of Garth Brooks on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; among the top ten best in history, due to &quot;his surprising chemistry with Chris Kattan&#x27;s Mango&quot;. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; placed Mango&#x27;s debut with actor Brendan Fraser among &quot;The 50 greatest &#x27;Saturday Night Live&#x27; skits of all time&quot;. &quot;The Art of Comedy&quot; placed Mango among &quot;some of the greatest characters&quot; from the series.

==Writing and development==
Chris Kattan based the Mango character from a combination of his Russian ex-girlfriend, his Dalmatian Winnie, the song &quot;Missing&quot; by the band Everything but the Girl, and an actual performer he met in a strip club, named Mango. Kattan developed the character initially with writer Scott Wainio, for a sketch with guest host actor Brendan Fraser. Kattan stated in the book &quot;Live From New York&quot;, &quot;The character of Mango was actually kind of based on an ex-girlfriend. There was a manipulation to her that was incredibly charming.&quot; He explained her comedic appeal, &quot;And the joke was that she was a bad dancer but for some ungodly reason, men just fell for her.&quot; Kattan developed the character as an androgynous person. 

Kattan said he was inspired by the character Lola Lola portrayed by actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1930 the film, &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;. The character debuted on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on episode three of season 23 on October 18, 1997. Kattan stated his mother did not appreciate the character, telling him it was &quot;too fruity&quot;. Kattan recalled being pleased when at a Halloween party in Los Angeles multiple individuals decided to dress up in costume as Mango.

The television series &quot;Biography&quot; captured the transformation of Kattan into Mango for a special two-hour episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, as part of its documentary production about the history of the program. Regular appearances of the Mango character on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; formally ended with Kattan&#x27;s 2003 departure from the show. He appeared on 16 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episodes between 1997 and 2002.

==Character appearance==
Mango is presented in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a man who works as an exotic dancer and stripper. The character is proficient in go-go dancing. He acts in public with a feminine style of personal attitude. His attire includes fuchsia garments that are too small for his frame, a pink top, gold shorts, and a sparkling beret cap. His wife is portrayed by actress Molly Shannon. He works as an exotic dancer in order to provide food for his children and family. His manner of speech includes a Hispanic type of accent, and he speaks about himself to others in the third person. His nationality was left ambiguous. He describes his appeal to others, stating, &quot;If you start out using Mango, it will only lead to more Mango.&quot; Mango&#x27;s oft-used catchphrase was, &quot;You can&#x27;t have the Mango.&quot;

All those persons who encounter Mango end up becoming in love or infatuated with him, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.Some who fell under Mango&#x27;s spell include a gang leader portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, as well as actors David Duchovny, Ellen DeGeneres, Garth Brooks, and Cuba Gooding Jr. Others who fell for Mango&#x27;s charms on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; included actor Tom Berenger, actress Bea Arthur, the actors from the show &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;, and physician Deepak Chopra. 

Mango himself was shown to be attracted to actress and singer Jennifer Lopez. Lopez and Mango get into conflict when he is shown to be more famous than her. They appear together in a film shoot for a music video by Lopez. The director proclaims to Mango, &quot;You&#x27;re gonna be bigger than Jennifer Lopez!&quot; Lopez appears offended, and the two engage in a physical altercation. 

Mango had an infatuation with actor Matt Damon, and on a subsequent program, Ben Affleck falls in love with Mango and appears as an impostor of Damon in order to attempt to woo Mango as his own conquest. Country music singer Garth Brooks appeared proclaiming his desires for Mango while the character was outfitted in a leopard-print costume. Monica Lewinsky was planned to be shown as Mango&#x27;s spouse on an episode, but the host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for that week was actor Cuba Gooding Jr. and he canceled the initiative. Gwyneth Paltrow portrayed Mango&#x27;s love interest from high school when she guest hosted the show in 2001. The last sketch with Mango was an appearance with actress Winona Ryder where they were shopping together.

==Post-&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;==
In June 2014, Mango was featured in a preview of Missy Elliott protégée Sharaya J&#x27;s &quot;Shut It Down&quot; via a &quot;T by Alexander Wang&quot; campaign. He also did a video on the designer&#x27;s YouTube account. Wang had Mango as his invited guest at the 2014 CFDA Fashion Awards. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented of his appearance at the awards show in-character, &quot;actor Chris Kattan looked like he was auditioning for &quot;Cabaret&quot; in his louche black shorts as he reprised his SNL character Mango.&quot; Wang commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve always loved Mango&#x27;s character from SNL&quot;. Wang observed, &quot;Sometimes when fashion becomes too stiff, it&#x27;s great to have someone such as Mango come through and inject a new burst of energy. Having fun and a sense of humor is so important to me that when I&#x27;m able to incorporate it into my work, I run with it.&quot; 

Saks Fifth Avenue collaborated with Wang, and sold &quot;Alexander Wang&#x27;s Mango shorts&quot; in its &quot;Live From New York&quot; collection with assistance from costume designer for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Tom Broecker. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed &quot;Alexander Wang&#x27;s Mango shorts&quot; as number 2 on its list of top seven most ridiculous items from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sold by Saks Fifth Avenue. In the video produced for Wang, Mango appears again portrayed by Kattan, with his personal assistant, Rudy, portrayed by former National Hockey League player Sean Avery. Fashion model Behati Prinsloo appears in the Wang video as well, along with reality television celebrity Sonja Morgan and reporter Derek Blasberg. 

Mango&#x27;s story picks up explaining he had been residing with his pet Shih Tzu, Constance, together in a &quot;Fortress of Mango-hood&quot;, in the Arctic Circle. Mango explains he rejected the romantic advances of both Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Mango asserts that the dog is his &quot;sober companion&quot; therapy animal. He is coaxed back to New York City by Alexander Wang, to help with his fashion show, where he receives dancing instruction from choreographer Sharaya J. Mango is still shown to have attractive charisma to all those he encounters. &quot;Harpers Bazaar&quot; placed the video &quot;Mango for T by Alexander Wang&quot; at number nine on its list of &quot;The 17 Best Fashion Short Films of the Year&quot;. Subsequently in 2017, when Kattan appeared on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; alongside professional dancer Witney Carson, their team came to be known as &quot;TeamMangoTango&quot;.

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, journalist Marty Meitus commented on the popularity of the character, &quot;Contrary to popular belief, Saturday Night Live did not make the name mango a household word. Or maybe it did.&quot; &quot;The New York Observer&quot; wrote of Kattan&#x27;s work with the character that he received, &quot;big laughs ... as Mango, the exotic dancer who is infinitely attractive to both men and women. Even Garth Brooks has taken part in a Mango sketch, pledging his love to the ambisexual, leopard-print-wearing maniac.&quot; The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; called him a &quot;high energy character&quot; that was &quot;a welcome breath of stinky air&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2001, Michael O&#x27;Sullivan called actress Marlene Dietrich the &quot;spiritual godmother&quot; of the Mango character from her portrayal of Lola Lola from the Josef von Sternberg directed 1930 film &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;. 

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called Mango the actor&#x27;s &quot;signature character&quot;. In his 2002 book on the history of NBC, author Marc Robinson wrote in his work &quot;Brought to You in Living Color&quot;, &quot;Chris Kattan&#x27;s high-strung exotic dancer, Mango, has been the &#x27;fantasy&#x27; of many an SNL guest host, male and female.&quot; Reflecting back on the material in &quot;Live From New York&quot; (2002), comedian and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, writer Jim Downey placed Mango among the top 7-10 frequent recurring sketches from the total history of the television series. 

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented on the ambiguous sexual nature of the character, &quot;As Mango, Kattan played a simian-human hybrid of ambiguous sexuality who had the power to seduce straight men. Kattan&#x27;s Mango moved in a highly ostentatious way – a cross between a gay man and a meerkat.&quot; &quot;Out&quot; journalist Michael Musto wrote, &quot;Chris Kattan is best known for wacky characters like Mango, the slithering multisexual go-go dancer he etched into our memories on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.&quot; Writing in his 2010 book &quot;The Art of Comedy&quot;, author Paul Ryan characterized Mango among &quot;Some of the greatest characters from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&quot;, including The Church Lady by Dana Carvey. 

Writing in the chapter &quot;Everybody Loves the Mango&quot; in the 2013 book &quot;Saturday Night Live FAQ&quot;, author Stephen Tropiano called Mango a &quot;bizarre character&quot;. Tropiano wrote of the actor&#x27;s performance of the character, &quot;Like Will Ferrell, Kattan is fearless and will go to extremes to get a laugh.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed the hosting job of Garth Brooks on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; among the top ten best in history, due to &quot;his surprising chemistry with Chris Kattan&#x27;s Mango&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Mango one of the &quot;beloved characters&quot; created by Kattan, in addition to Mr. Peepers and Doug Butabi. 

The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; placed Mango&#x27;s debut with actor Brendan Fraser at 26 among &quot;The 50 greatest &#x27;Saturday Night Live&#x27; skits of all time&quot;. &quot;The Maine Edge&quot; placed Mango among &quot;beloved bits&quot; from the show. Writing for &quot;Polygon&quot; in 2019, Joe Reid placed the Mango character among &quot;queer canon&quot; from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Reid commented, &quot;The joke, of course, was that Mango was not gay, but just the ephemeral, unknowable Mango. Which, honestly, could play as a kind of post-gender thing today if the show ever wanted to ask Kattan back.&quot; 

The Associated Press noted Kattan &quot;was best known for the character Mango&quot; out of all of his acting work on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Writing for &quot;StyleCaster&quot;, Laurel Pinson called Mango a &quot;cult character&quot; from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; observed Kattan gained much of his fame for portraying Mango and Mr. Peepers on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; called Mango one of Kattan&#x27;s &quot;most iconic characters&quot;. &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; called Mango one of the &quot;most memorable characters&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Tracy Bringhurst of the &quot;Idaho Press-Tribune&quot; wrote in 2020 of the lasting impression made by the character, &quot;His recurring characters, from Mango to Mr. Peepers, have had lasting resonance with fans of the show.&quot; Paolo Alfar wrote in 2020 for &quot;Screen Rant&quot; that the Mango sketches were among the most underrated performances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Alfar commented, &quot;Mango is Chris Kattan&#x27;s best recurring solo character.&quot;

<text>Rudolf Heinrich Zille (10 January 1858 – 9 August 1929) was a German illustrator, caricaturist, lithographer and photographer.

==Childhood and education==
Zille was born in Radeburg near Dresden, son of watchmaker Johann Traugott Zill (&quot;Zille&quot; since 1854) and Ernestine Louise (born &quot;Heinitz&quot;, daughter of a miner from the Ore Mountains). His father had originally been a blacksmith, however, being technically skilled, had gone on to become a watchmaker, goldsmith and inventor of tools. Zille spent his early years in Potschappel. His childhood was not without trouble. His father was incarcerated several times in debtors&#x27; prison and creditors harassed the family so much that the young Zille was often sent to live with his grandmother. In 1867 the family left town because of their debts and moved to Berlin. While still in school, the young Zille began to take drawing lessons. The teacher was supportive, and during a discussion of his future career aspirations, encouraged Zille to become a lithographer. Zille&#x27;s father wanted Heinrich to become a butcher, but Heinrich could not stand the sight of blood. After he finished school in 1872 he went to the draughtsman Fritz Hecht on Jakobstraße and started an apprenticeship as a lithographer.

==Career==
In 1883, he married Hulda Frieske, with whom he had three children. She died in 1919.

Zille became best known for his (often funny) drawings, catching the characteristics of people, especially &quot;stereotypes&quot;, mainly from Berlin and many of them published in the German weekly satirical newspaper &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;. He was the first to portray the desperate social environment of the Berlin Mietskasernen (literally &quot;tenement barracks&quot;), buildings packed with sometimes a dozen persons per room who fled from the rural regions to the expanding industrial metropolis during the Gründerzeit only to find even deeper poverty in the developing proletarian class.

His special talent was the scathingly humorous portrayal of what were in reality quite unfunny life conditions of handicapped beggars, tuberculous prostitutes, and menial labourers, and especially their children, making the best they could of life and resolutely refusing to give up.

Zille did not consider himself a real artist: he often said that his work was not the result of talent but merely of hard work. Max Liebermann nevertheless promoted him. He called him into the Berlin Secession in 1903, featured his work in exhibitions, and encouraged him to sell drawings – and when Zille lost his job as a lithographer in 1910, he encouraged him to live from his drawings alone.

The Berlin &quot;Common People&quot; paid him the greatest respect, and very late in life his fame culminated when both poverty and freedom of expression reached new heights in the roaring twenties, with the National Gallery buying some drawings in 1921, the Academy of the Arts honouring him with a professorship in 1924, and Gerhard Lamprecht making the film &quot;Die Verrufenen&quot; based on his cartoon characters and stories in 1925. His 70th birthday in 1928 was celebrated throughout Berlin. He died one year later. He is buried at the Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery near Berlin.

==Legacy and honors==
Heinrich Zille Park on Bergstraße in Berlin&#x27;s Mitte borough was named for him by the City of Berlin in 1948 and formerly featured a statue of him from the workshop of Paul Kentsch, but the statue&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown and the park is now a children&#x27;s adventure playground. There is a Zille Memorial statue created in 1964–65 by Heinrich Drake in the Lapidary within Köllnischer Park, also in Mitte. An elementary school in Berlin&#x27;s Friedrichshain district is named in his honor.

A museum dedicated to Zille&#x27;s work opened in Berlin&#x27;s Nikolaiviertel, in Mitte, in 2002; in 2007 a statue of him by Thorsten Stegmann was erected nearby.

It is less known that Zille produced many erotic pictures that are close to pornography but also show the life of normal people; some of them can be seen in the Beate Uhse Erotic Museum in Berlin.

In 1983 director Werner W. Wallroth made an East German film based on a musical written by Dieter Wardetzky and Peter Rabenalt. This movie, &quot;Zille und Ick&quot; (&quot;Zille and I&quot; in Berlin dialect), is not a real biopic but uses parts of Zille&#x27;s life for the story.

A drawing by Zille appears on a German postage stamp of 55 Euro-Cents, with the caption &quot;Heinrich Zille, 1858–1929&quot;.

Zille&#x27;s grandniece is Helen Zille, the former mayor of Cape Town and Premier of the Western Cape province in South Africa.

<doc id="618269" wikidata="Q158436" url="?curid=618269" title="Ernst Krenek">
<text>Ernst Heinrich Krenek (, 23 August 1900 – 22 December 1991) was an Austrian, later American, composer. He explored atonality and other modern styles and wrote a number of books, including &quot;Music Here and Now&quot; (1939), a study of Johannes Ockeghem (1953), and &quot;Horizons Circled: Reflections on my Music&quot; (1974). Krenek wrote two pieces using the pseudonym Thornton Winsloe.

==Life==
Born Ernst Heinrich Křenek in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary), he was the son of a Czech soldier in the Austro-Hungarian army. He studied there and in Berlin with Franz Schreker before working in a number of German opera houses as conductor. During World War I, Krenek was drafted into the Austrian army, but he was stationed in Vienna, allowing him to go on with his musical studies. In 1922 he met Alma Mahler, widow of Gustav Mahler, and her daughter, Anna, to whom he dedicated his Symphony No. 2, and whom he married in January 1924. That marriage ended in divorce before its first anniversary.
At the time of his marriage to Anna Mahler, Krenek was completing his Violin Concerto No. 1, Op. 29. The Australian violinist Alma Moodie assisted Krenek, not with the scoring of the violin part, but with getting financial assistance from her Swiss patron Werner Reinhart at a time when there was hyper-inflation in Germany. In gratitude, Krenek dedicated the concerto to Moodie, and she premiered it on January 5, 1925, in Dessau. Krenek&#x27;s divorce from Anna Mahler became final a few days after the premiere. Krenek did not attend the premiere, but he did have an affair with Moodie, which has been described as &quot;short-lived and complicated&quot;. He never managed to hear her play the concerto, but he did &quot;immortalize some aspects of her personality in the character of Anita in his opera &quot;Jonny spielt auf&quot;&quot;. This &#x27;jazz opera&#x27;, completed in 1926, was an enormous success across Europe and made Krenek a household name for several years; there is even a brand of cigarettes, still on the market today in Austria, named &quot;Jonny&quot;. Krenek himself became uncomfortable with this success though, as his musical colleagues criticised the commercialisation of his music, and shortly afterwards changed his compositional direction radically.

The jazz-influenced score of &quot;Jonny spielt auf&quot; and its central character of a black jazz musician (who is also seen womanising and stealing a priceless violin) brought Krenek the opprobrium of the nascent Nazi Party; the image of Jonny was distorted to form the centrepiece of the poster advertising the &quot;Entartete Musik&quot; exhibition of so-called &#x27;degenerate&#x27; music in 1938. Krenek was frequently named as a Jewish composer during the Third Reich, although he was not, and was intimidated by the regime until his emigration; on March 6, 1933, one day after the last semi-free election of March 1933, Krenek&#x27;s incidental music to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Triumph der Empfindsamkeit&quot; was withdrawn in Mannheim, and eventually pressure was brought to bear on the Vienna State Opera, which cancelled the commissioned premiere of &quot;Karl V&quot;.

In 1938 Krenek moved to the United States, where he taught music at various universities, the first being Vassar College. He later taught at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota from 1942 to 1947. There he met and married his third wife, the composer Gladys Nordenstrom, who was his student at the time. He became an American citizen in 1945. He later moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he taught at The Royal Conservatory of Music during the 1950s. His students included Milton Barnes, Lorne Betts, Roque Cordero, Samuel Dolin, Robert Erickson, Halim El-Dabh, Richard Maxfield, Will Ogdon, George Perle, Virginia Seay, and Hsiung-Zee Wong. Later he moved to Tujunga, before moving to Palm Springs, California in 1966. He died there in 1991, aged 91, but was buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery. In 1998 Gladys Nordenstrom founded the Ernst Krenek Institute; in 2004 the private foundation moved from Vienna to Krems an der Donau, Austria.

==Completions of other composers&#x27; unfinished works==
After meeting Krenek in 1922, Alma Mahler asked him to complete her late husband&#x27;s Symphony No. 10. Krenek assisted in editing the first and third movements but went no further. More fruitful was Krenek&#x27;s response to an approximately contemporary request from his pianist and composer friend Eduard Erdmann, who wished to add Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Reliquie&quot; piano sonata to his repertoire, for completions of that work&#x27;s fragmentary third and fourth movements. Krenek&#x27;s completion, dated to 1921 in some sources but to 1922 in his own memory, later found other champions in Webster Aitken in the concert hall and Ray Lev; Friedrich Wührer; and, more recently, Stanislav Khristenko on records.

In his notes to the Lev recording, dated July 1947, Krenek offered insights into the challenges of completing another composer&#x27;s works in general and the Schubert sonata in particular.

Completing the unfinished work of a great master is a very delicate task. In my opinion it can honestly be undertaken only if the original fragment contains all of the main ideas of the unfinished work. In such a case a respectful craftsman may attempt, after an absorbing study of the master&#x27;s style, to elaborate on those ideas in a way which to the best of his knowledge might have been the way of the master himself. The work in question will probably have analogies among other, completed works of the master, and careful investigation of his methods in similar situations will indicate possible solutions of the problems posed by the unfinished work. Even then the artist who goes about the ticklish task will feel slightly uneasy, knowing from his own experience as a composer that the creative mind does not always follow its own precedents. He is more conscious of the fact that unpredictability is one of the most jealously guarded prerogatives of genius. ... However, scruples of this kind may be set aside once we are certain that the author of the fragment has put forth the essential thematic material that was expected to go into the work. If this is not the case, I feel that no one, not even the greatest genius, should dare to complete the fragments left by another genius.

As an example, Krenek explains that a careful student of Rembrandt&#x27;s style might be able to complete a painting lacking one or two corners but could never supply two entirely missing paintings from a four-painting series; such an attempt would result only in &quot;more or less successful fakes&quot;. Turning to a musical example, Krenek, evidently unaware of the surviving sketch of a third movement, avers that Schubert&#x27;s own &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony &quot;was left by its creator with only two of its four movements written; of the other two there is no trace. It would be possible to write two or more movements to the symphony in the manner of Schubert, but it would not be Schubert.&quot;

==Musical style==
Krenek&#x27;s music encompassed a variety of styles and reflects many of the principal musical influences of the 20th century. His early work is in a late-Romantic idiom, showing the influence of his teacher Franz Schreker, but around 1920 he turned to atonality, under the influence of Ernst Kurth&#x27;s textbook, &quot;Grundlagen des linearen Kontrapunkts&quot;, and the tenets of Busoni, Schnabel, Erdmann, and Scherchen, amongst others.

A visit to Paris, during which he became familiar with the work of Igor Stravinsky (&quot;Pulcinella&quot; was especially influential) and Les Six, led him to adopt a neo-classical style around 1924. Shortly afterward, he turned to neoromanticism and incorporated jazz influences into his opera &quot;Jonny spielt auf&quot; (Jonny Strikes Up, 1926) and one-act opera Schwergewicht (1928). Other neoromantic works of this period were modeled on music of Franz Schubert, a prime example being &quot;Reisebuch aus den österreichischen Alpen&quot; (1929).

Krenek abandoned the neoromantic style in the late 1920s to embrace Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique, the method exclusively employed in Krenek&#x27;s opera &quot;Karl V&quot; (1931–33) and most of his later pieces. His most uncompromising use of the twelve-tone technique was in his Sixth String Quartet (1936) and his Piano Variations (1937). In the &quot;Lamentatio Jeremiae prophetae&quot; (1941–42) Krenek combined twelve-tone writing with techniques of modal counterpoint of the Renaissance. He used motifs composed by his student Virginia Seay in his works &quot;Hurricane Variations for Piano, opus 100&quot; (1944) and Tricks and Trifles (1945), also for piano.

In 1955 he was invited to work in the Electronic Music Studio at WDR in Cologne, and this experience motivated him to develop a total serial idiom. Beginning around 1960 he added to his serial vocabulary some principles of aleatoric music, in works such as &quot;Horizon Circled&quot; (1967), &quot;From Three Make Seven&quot; (1960–61), and &quot;Fibonacci-Mobile&quot; (1964).

In his later years his compositional style became more relaxed, though he continued to use elements of both twelve-tone and total serial techniques.

<text>Broadway Tower is an 18th-century folly near the village of Broadway, in the English county of Worcestershire. It is a Grade II listed building.

The tower is built of limestone ashlar and is four storeys high, hexagonal, with three round corner turrets, battlements and gargoyles. It stands above the village of Broadway on Broadway Hill, the second-highest point of the Cotswolds, at an elevation of . The tower itself is tall. Although a folly, it is a functional building with interior rooms, the top three floors being used as a museum. The rooftop viewing platform can be accessed for good views. Two of the turrets each contain a spiral staircase leading from the ground to the roof.

The tower is on the Cotswold Way, and can be reached by following this footpath from the A44 road at Fish Hill, or by a steep climb out of Broadway village. It is now the centre of Broadway Tower Country Park, which has exhibitions open to the public for a fee, as well as a gift shop and restaurant.

==History==
The Saxon-style tower was the brainchild of landscaper Capability Brown, designed by architect James Wyatt in 1794 in the form of a castle, and built by the 6th Earl of Coventry for his wife Barbara in 1798–1799. Broadway Hill was a beacon hill, where beacons were lit on special occasions. The tower was just visible from the Coventrys&#x27; home at Croome Court in south Worcestershire, about to the north-west, past the north escarpment of Bredon Hill. One theory for its construction says that Lady Coventry wondered if a beacon on the hill could be seen from her house. Another is that it served to signal to the Croome Court staff that the earl and his wife were returning from their Spring Hill estate.

From 1822 to 1862, the tower housed the private printing press of Sir Thomas Phillipps. By the mid-1870s, it was being rented by C. J. Stone and Cormell Price. Price was headmaster of the United Services College at Westward Ho! and a friend of artists William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti; in 1876 Morris wrote in a letter to Aglaia Coronio that he was &quot;today at Crom Price&#x27;s Tower among the winds and the clouds&quot;.

Near the tower is a memorial to the crew of an A.W.38 Whitley bomber that crashed there during a training mission in June 1943.

In the late 1950s, an underground Royal Observer Corps monitoring post was built nearby. It was decommissioned in 1991, but has been restored, and is now one of the few such Cold War monitoring facilities in England still extant and accessible to visitors.

The Tower was built on the site of the Campden Wonder Executions.

<text>An ex-voto is a votive offering to a saint or a divinity, given in fulfillment of a vow (hence the Latin term, short for &quot;ex voto suscepto&quot;, &quot;from the vow made&quot;) or in gratitude or devotion. The term is usually restricted to Christian examples. 

==Definition==
Ex-votos are placed in a church or chapel where the worshiper seeks grace or wishes to give thanks. The destinations of pilgrimages often include shrines decorated with ex-votos.

Ex-votos can take a wide variety of forms. They are not only intended for the invocated, but also as a testimony to later visitors of the received help. As such they may include texts explaining a miracle attributed to the helper, or symbols such as a painted or modeled reproduction of a miraculously healed body part, or a directly related item such as a crutch given by a person formerly lame. There are places where a very old tradition of depositing ex-votos existed, such as Abydos in ancient Egypt.

==Ex-voto paintings==

Especially in the Latin world, there is a tradition of votive paintings, typically depicting a dangerous incident which the offeror survived. The votive paintings of Mexico are paralleled in other countries. In Italy, where more than 15,000 ex-voto paintings are thought to survive from before 1600, these began to appear in the 1490s, probably modelled on the small predella panels below altarpieces. These are a form of folk art, in Mexico typically painted cheaply on tin plates salvaged from packaging.

Other examples may be large and grand paintings, such as Titian&#x27;s &quot;Jacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter&quot;, given in thanks for a naval victory. In Venice it became the custom in the Renaissance for the higher officials, beginning with the Doge, to commission (at their personal expense) an ex-voto painting in the form of a portrait of themselves with religious figures, usually the Virgin or saints, in thanks for achieving their office. For lower officials only their coat of arms might represent the official. The painting was hung in the public building where they worked or presided. An example is the Barbarigo Altarpiece, a votive portrait of Doge Agostino Barbarigo with the Virgin and Child, two saints and assorted angels, by Giovanni Bellini (1488). This was made for the Doge&#x27;s Palace but is now in San Pietro Martire, Murano.

The &quot;Ex-Voto de 1662&quot; is a painting by Philippe de Champaigne (now Louvre), showing two nuns, one of whom recovered from serious illness.

==A few examples==
In the church of Notre-Dame de la Garde in Marseille, France, the site of a major local pilgrimage, the ex-votos include paintings, plaques, model ships, war medals and even football shirts given by players and supporters of Olympique de Marseille, the local team. The magnificent Lod mosaic is thought to be an ex-voto expressing gratitude for rescue from a shipwreck. In the long Votive Chapel of Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory in Montreal, there are fixed on iron grilles hundreds of crutches, canes and braces left behind by pilgrims who claimed to have received a healing while meeting with Brother André, CSC. Pope Benedict XVI recognized the authenticity of the miracles and canonized Saint André Bessette in 2011.

<text>Antonín Mrkos () (27 January 1918, Střemchoví – 29 May 1996, Prague) was a Czech astronomer.

==Biography==
Mrkos entered the University in Brno in 1938. His studies were interrupted by the onset of World War II, and in 1945 he became a staff member at the Skalnaté Pleso Observatory in Czechoslovakia (now in Slovakia). It was from here that he carried out his extremely active cometary programme and became the discoverer of several unusual comets, the most famous of them the bright Comet 1957d.

He was the second Czech in Antarctica and the first Czechoslovak to reach the Southern Pole of Inaccessibility as a member of the 3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition (1957–1959). The Czechoslovakian flag was the second flag raised after the flag of the USSR. He returned to Antarctica as the head of the four-member Czechoslovakian crew in the seventh Soviet Antarctic Expedition (1961–1963). He was studying auroras among other things.

He was invited for what would have been his third expedition to the Antarctic but could not participate because of an almost fatal accident. It is thought someone tried to injure or to kill him by adding a bottle of strongly concentrated detergent among his other bottles of mineral water. Since this accident he could only eat liquid meals for the rest of his life.

In 1965 he became director of Kleť Observatory. Beginning in 1968 he made photographic observations at Kleť and extended this activity to minor planets in 1977. For many years he was the most regular contributor of data to the Minor Planet Center. He was President of Commission 6 from 1985 until 1988 (and vice president from 1982 until 1985). He was associate professor at the Charles University in Prague and the University of South Bohemia. Mrkos died in 1996 in Prague, aged 78.

He discovered or co-discovered thirteen comets. Among these were the periodic comets 18D/Perrine–Mrkos, 45P/Honda–Mrkos–Pajdušáková, 124P/Mrkos and 143P/Kowal–Mrkos. He also discovered the bright non-periodic comet C/1957 P1 (or, in the nomenclature of the time, comet 1957d). He discovered a number of asteroids (273 in total), including the Amor asteroid 5797 Bivoj and Trojan asteroid 3451 Mentor.

Mrkos named asteroids 6758 Jesseowens in honour of Jesse Owens and 2747 Český Krumlov after the historic town of the same name. Another main-belt asteroid, 3357 Tolstikov, was named in honour of Yevgeny Tolstikov with whom he had explored the Antarctic in his youth. Fellow astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh named 1832 Mrkos in his honour, while Mrkos gratified her and her husband Nikolai with 2325 Chernykh.

<doc id="618285" wikidata="Q2495858" url="?curid=618285" title="University of Louisiana System">
<text>The University of Louisiana System (UL System) is a public university system in the U.S. state of Louisiana. It enrolls more students than the other three public university systems in the state; as of October 2023, it claims more than 91,500 students throughout its institutions. Its headquarters are in the Claiborne Building in Baton Rouge.

==History==
The UL System began operating under its new name in 1996, and was founded in 1975 as the Board of Trustees for State Colleges and Universities.

==Member institutions==
The University of Louisiana System has nine member institutions:
*Grambling State University main campus
*Louisiana Tech University main campus
*McNeese State University main campus
*Nicholls State University main campus
*Northwestern State University main campus
*Southeastern Louisiana University main campus
*University of Louisiana at Lafayette main campus
*University of Louisiana at Monroe main campus
*University of New Orleans main campus

==Administration==
The system&#x27;s president and CEO is Rick Gallot, replacing Jim Henderson in October 2023. Henderson was hired as president in 2016.

===Past presidents=== 
* William &quot;Bill&quot; Junkin (1975–1986, as Executive Director)
* J. Larry Crain (1986–1988)
* David C. McCormick (1989–1991)
* James A. Caillier (1992–1999)
* Carroll Falcon (acting) (1998–1999, 2001)
* Bobby Jindal (1999–2001)
* Sally Clausen (2001–2008)
* Randy Moffett (2008–2012)
* Sandra Woodley (2013–2015).
* Dan Reneau (acting) (2015–2016)
* Jim Henderson (2016-2023)

Crain, Clausen, and Moffett had previously been president of Southeastern Louisiana University. Jindal, a future Louisiana governor, was the youngest president of the University of Louisiana system at age 28.

== Naming conventions ==
In 1999, the University of Southwestern Louisiana became the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and Northeast Louisiana University became the University of Louisiana at Monroe, based on legislation passed in 1995. ULS policy requires both school&#x27;s abbreviated names to include the municipality, precluding the use of &quot;UL&quot; alone. In 2013, Woodley stated that the policy does not address stand-alone usage of &quot;Louisiana&quot; including within athletics, where usage of particular monikers and acronyms became a point of contention. Soon after, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette&#x27;s athletic moniker became the &quot;Louisiana Ragin&#x27; Cajuns.&quot;

<doc id="618287" wikidata="Q534991" url="?curid=618287" title="The Father Christmas Letters">
<text>Letters from Father Christmas, formerly known as The Father Christmas Letters, are a collection of letters written and illustrated by J. R. R. Tolkien between 1920 and 1943 for his children, from Father Christmas. They were released posthumously by the Tolkien estate on 2 September 1976, the 3rd anniversary of Tolkien&#x27;s death. They were edited by Baillie Tolkien, second wife of his youngest son, Christopher. The book was warmly received by critics, and it has been suggested that elements of the stories inspired parts of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

==Plot==
The stories are told in the format of a series of letters, told either from the point of view of Father Christmas or his elvish secretary. They document the adventures and misadventures of Father Christmas and his helpers, including the North Polar Bear and his two sidekick cubs, Paksu and Valkotukka. The stories include descriptions of the massive fireworks that create the northern lights and how Polar Bear manages to get into trouble on more than one occasion.

The 1939 letter has Father Christmas making reference to the Second World War, while some of the later letters feature Father Christmas&#x27; battles against goblins, which were subsequently interpreted as being a reflection of Tolkien&#x27;s views on the German menace.

==Publication==
The letters themselves were written over a period of over 20 years to entertain Tolkien&#x27;s children each Christmas. Starting in 1920 when Tolkien&#x27;s oldest son was aged three, each Christmas Tolkien would write a letter from Father Christmas about his travels and adventures. Each letter was delivered in an envelope, including North Pole stamps and postage marks as designed by Tolkien.

Prior to publication, an exhibition of Tolkien&#x27;s drawings was held at the Ashmolean Museum. These included works from &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and the &quot;Letters from Father Christmas&quot;. The first edition was published by Allen and Unwin on 2 September 1976 under the name &quot;The Father Christmas Letters&quot;, three years after Tolkien&#x27;s death. The Houghton Mifflin edition was released later that year on 19 October. It was the third work by Tolkien to be released posthumously, after a collection of poems and the &quot;Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Edited by Baillie Tolkien, the second wife of Christopher Tolkien, it includes illustrations by Tolkien for nearly all the letters; however, it omitted several letters and drawings.

When the book was republished in 1999, it was retitled &quot;Letters from Father Christmas&quot; and several letters and drawings not contained in the original edition were added. One edition in 1995 featured the letters and drawings contained in individual envelopes to be read in the manner they were originally conceived to be.

==Reception==
The reception to the first two works published posthumously had been warm, which was subsequently thought to be due to Tolkien&#x27;s recent death. The response to the &quot;Letters from Father Christmas&quot; was much more measured and balanced. Jessica Kemball-Cook suggested in her book &quot;Twentieth Century Children&#x27;s Writers&quot; that it would become known as a classic of children&#x27;s literature, while Nancy Willard for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; also received the book positively, saying &quot;Father Christmas lives. And never more merrily than in these pages.&quot; In 2002, an article in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; described the work as rivalling &quot;&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for sheer imaginative joy&quot;. In 2023, an extract from one of the &quot;Letters from Father Christmas&quot; was read out by actor Jim Broadbent at the televised &#x27;Together at Christmas&#x27; carol service in Westminster Abbey on Friday 8 December, broadcast to the nation on Christmas Eve that year.

==Influence==
Paul H. Kocher, whilst writing for the journal &quot;Mythprint&quot;, suggested that the creatures in the &quot;Letters from Father Christmas&quot; may have been a precursor to those which appeared in Tolkien&#x27;s later works such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a view which was shared by Laurence and Martha Krieg in a review in the journal &quot;Mythlore&quot; (issue #14). For example, the 1933 letter features an attack on Polar Bear by a band of goblins. The Kriegs suggested that the wizard Gandalf may have been developed from Father Christmas.

<text>The Bohr effect is a phenomenon first described in 1904 by the Danish physiologist Christian Bohr. Hemoglobin&#x27;s oxygen binding affinity (see oxygen–haemoglobin dissociation curve) is inversely related both to acidity and to the concentration of carbon dioxide. That is, the Bohr effect refers to the shift in the oxygen dissociation curve caused by changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide or the pH of the environment. Since carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, an increase in CO2 results in a decrease in blood pH, resulting in hemoglobin proteins releasing their load of oxygen. Conversely, a decrease in carbon dioxide provokes an increase in pH, which results in hemoglobin picking up more oxygen.

== Experimental discovery ==

In the early 1900s, Christian Bohr was a professor at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, already well known for his work in the field of respiratory physiology. He had spent the last two decades studying the solubility of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases in various liquids, and had conducted extensive research on haemoglobin and its affinity for oxygen. In 1903, he began working closely with Karl Hasselbalch and August Krogh, two of his associates at the university, in an attempt to experimentally replicate the work of Gustav von Hüfner, using whole blood instead of haemoglobin solution. Hüfner had suggested that the oxygen-haemoglobin binding curve was hyperbolic in shape, but after extensive experimentation, the Copenhagen group determined that the curve was in fact sigmoidal. Furthermore, in the process of plotting out numerous dissociation curves, it soon became apparent that high partial pressures of carbon dioxide caused the curves to shift to the right. Further experimentation while varying the CO2 concentration quickly provided conclusive evidence, confirming the existence of what would soon become known as the Bohr effect.

=== Controversy ===
There is some more debate over whether Bohr was actually the first to discover the relationship between CO2 and oxygen affinity, or whether the Russian physiologist beat him to it, allegedly discovering the effect in 1898, six years before Bohr. While this has never been proven, Verigo did in fact publish a paper on the haemoglobin-CO2 relationship in 1892. His proposed model was flawed, and Bohr harshly criticized it in his own publications.

Another challenge to Bohr&#x27;s discovery comes from within his lab. Though Bohr was quick to take full credit, his associate Krogh, who invented the apparatus used to measure gas concentrations in the experiments, maintained throughout his life that he himself had actually been the first to demonstrate the effect. Though there is some evidence to support this, retroactively changing the name of a well-known phenomenon would be extremely impractical, so it remains known as the Bohr effect.

== Physiological role ==
The Bohr effect increases the efficiency of oxygen transportation through the blood. After hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the lungs due to the high oxygen concentrations, the Bohr effect facilitates its release in the tissues, particularly those tissues in most need of oxygen. When a tissue&#x27;s metabolic rate increases, so does its carbon dioxide waste production. When released into the bloodstream, carbon dioxide forms bicarbonate and protons through the following reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + H2O &lt;=&gt; H2CO3 &lt;=&gt; H+ + HCO3^-&lt;/chem&gt;

Although this reaction usually proceeds very slowly, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (which is present in red blood cells) drastically speeds up the conversion to bicarbonate and protons. This causes the pH of the blood to decrease, which promotes the dissociation of oxygen from haemoglobin, and allows the surrounding tissues to obtain enough oxygen to meet their demands. In areas where oxygen concentration is high, such as the lungs, binding of oxygen causes haemoglobin to release protons, which recombine with bicarbonate to eliminate carbon dioxide during exhalation. These opposing protonation and deprotonation reactions occur in equilibrium resulting in little overall change in blood pH.

The Bohr effect enables the body to adapt to changing conditions and makes it possible to supply extra oxygen to tissues that need it the most. For example, when muscles are undergoing strenuous activity, they require large amounts of oxygen to conduct cellular respiration, which generates CO2 (and therefore HCO3− and H+) as byproducts. These waste products lower the pH of the blood, which increases oxygen delivery to the active muscles. Carbon dioxide is not the only molecule that can trigger the Bohr effect. If muscle cells aren&#x27;t receiving enough oxygen for cellular respiration, they resort to lactic acid fermentation, which releases lactic acid as a byproduct. This increases the acidity of the blood far more than CO2 alone, which reflects the cells&#x27; even greater need for oxygen. In fact, under anaerobic conditions, muscles generate lactic acid so quickly that pH of the blood passing through the muscles will drop to around 7.2, which causes haemoglobin to begin releasing roughly 10% more oxygen.

=== Strength of the effect and body size ===
The magnitude of the Bohr effect is usually given by the slope of the formula_1 vs formula_2 curve where, P50 refers to the partial pressure of oxygen when 50% of haemoglobin&#x27;s binding sites are occupied. The slope is denoted: formula_3 where formula_4 denotes change. That is, formula_5 denotes the change in formula_1 and formula_7 the change in formula_2.
Bohr effect strength exhibits an inverse relationship with the size of an organism: the magnitude increases as size and weight decreases. For example, mice possess a very strong Bohr effect, with a formula_3 value of -0.96, which requires relatively minor changes in H+ or CO2 concentrations, while elephants require much larger changes in concentration to achieve a much weaker effect formula_10.
== Mechanism ==
=== Allosteric interactions ===
The Bohr effect hinges around allosteric interactions between the hemes of the haemoglobin tetramer, a mechanism first proposed by Max Perutz in 1970. Haemoglobin exists in two conformations: a high-affinity R state and a low-affinity T state. When oxygen concentration levels are high, as in the lungs, the R state is favored, enabling the maximum amount of oxygen to be bound to the hemes. In the capillaries, where oxygen concentration levels are lower, the T state is favored, in order to facilitate the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. The Bohr effect is dependent on this allostery, as increases in CO2 and H+ help stabilize the T state and ensure greater oxygen delivery to muscles during periods of elevated cellular respiration. This is evidenced by the fact that myoglobin, a monomer with no allostery, does not exhibit the Bohr effect. Haemoglobin mutants with weaker allostery may exhibit a reduced Bohr effect. For example, in Hiroshima variant haemoglobinopathy, allostery in haemoglobin is reduced, and the Bohr effect is diminished. As a result, during periods of exercise, the mutant haemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and tissue may suffer minor oxygen starvation.

=== T-state stabilization ===
When hemoglobin is in its T state, the N-terminal amino groups of the α-subunits and the C-terminal histidine of the β-subunits are protonated, giving them a positive charge and allowing these residues to participate in ionic interactions with carboxyl groups on nearby residues. These interactions help hold the haemoglobin in the T state. Decreases in pH (increases in acidity) stabilize this state even more, since a decrease in pH makes these residues even more likely to be protonated, strengthening the ionic interactions. In the R state, the ionic pairings are absent, meaning that the R state&#x27;s stability increases when the pH increases, as these residues are less likely to stay protonated in a more basic environment. The Bohr effect works by simultaneously destabilizing the high-affinity R state and stabilizing the low-affinity T state, which leads to an overall decrease in oxygen affinity. This can be visualized on an oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve by shifting the whole curve to the right.

Carbon dioxide can also react directly with the N-terminal amino groups to form carbamates, according to the following reaction:
: &lt;chem&gt;R-NH2 + CO2 &lt;=&gt; R-NH-COO^- + H+&lt;/chem&gt;
CO2 forms carbamates more frequently with the T state, which helps to stabilize this conformation. The process also creates protons, meaning that the formation of carbamates also contributes to the strengthening of ionic interactions, further stabilizing the T state.

== Special cases ==
=== Marine mammals ===
An exception to the otherwise well-supported link between animal body size and the sensitivity of its haemoglobin to changes in pH was discovered in 1961. Based on their size and weight, many marine mammals were hypothesized to have a very low, almost negligible Bohr effect. However, when their blood was examined, this was not the case. Humpback whales weighing 41,000 kilograms had an observed formula_3 value of 0.82, which is roughly equivalent to the Bohr effect magnitude in a 0.57 kg guinea pig. This extremely strong Bohr effect is hypothesized to be one of marine mammals&#x27; many adaptations for deep, long dives, as it allows for virtually all of the bound oxygen on haemoglobin to dissociate and supply the whale&#x27;s body while it is underwater. Examination of other marine mammal species supports this. In pilot whales and porpoises, which are primarily surface feeders and seldom dive for more than a few minutes, the formula_3was 0.52, comparable to a cow, which is much closer to the expected Bohr effect magnitude for animals of their size.

=== Carbon monoxide ===
Another special case of the Bohr effect occurs when carbon monoxide is present. This molecule serves as a competitive inhibitor for oxygen, and binds to haemoglobin to form carboxyhaemoglobin. Haemoglobin&#x27;s affinity for CO is about 210 times stronger than its affinity for O2, meaning that it is very unlikely to dissociate, and once bound, it blocks the binding of O2 to that subunit. At the same time, CO is structurally similar enough to O2 to cause carboxyhemoglobin to favor the R state, raising the oxygen affinity of the remaining unoccupied subunits. This combination significantly reduces the delivery of oxygen to the tissues of the body, which is what makes carbon monoxide so toxic. This toxicity is reduced slightly by an increase in the strength of the Bohr effect in the presence of carboxyhemoglobin. This increase is ultimately due to differences in interactions between heme groups in carboxyhemoglobin relative to oxygenated hemoglobin. It is most pronounced when the oxygen concentration is extremely low, as a last-ditch effort when the need for oxygen delivery becomes critical. However, the physiological implications of this phenomenon remain unclear.

<text>The Moose River is a river in the Hudson Plains ecozone of northern Ontario, Canada. The river flows 100 km northeast from the confluence of the Mattagami and Missinaibi Rivers into James Bay. Its drainage basin is and it has a mean discharge rate of . Its full length is if counted from the head of the Mattagami River.

This river formed part of the water route to Lake Superior in the days of the fur trade. Moose Factory, located on Moose Factory Island near the river&#x27;s mouth, was a fur trading post of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and Ontario&#x27;s first English settlement. Moosonee, on the north bank of the river, is the northern terminus of the Polar Bear Express railway route which begins at Cochrane, Ontario.

==Moose River Bird Sanctuary==
Moose River Bird Sanctuary lies at the mouth of the Moose River and comprises Ship Sands Island and a piece of land on the eastern flats of the river mouth. The sanctuary is protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act and is part of the Southern James Bay wetland complex, which was designated a wetland of international importance (Ramsar Convention) in May 1987.

This area plays a significant role in the annual cycle of waterfowl. The funnel-shaped outline of Hudson and James bays causes birds migrating from the Arctic to concentrate at the southern end of James Bay each autumn, particularly in the late autumn, where the extensive coastal wetlands provide critical staging and moulting areas for migrating lesser snow geese, dabbling ducks and shorebirds such as red knot, short-billed dowitcher, dunlin, greater yellowlegs, lesser yellowlegs, ruddy turnstone, and American golden plover.

==Settlement of Moose River==
At mile 142 of the Polar Bear Express railway route there is a small settlement called Moose River. This settlement is just before a large railway bridge that crosses Moose River and is a flag stop on the Polar Bear Express rail route. There is an Ontario Northland Railway bunkhouse that used to be a school. The Moose River bridge was built in the 1930s and the settlement was a much larger community at that time. Currently the Moose River stop at mile 142 is used for the residents of the settlement and as a pick-up and drop-off site for boaters.

<doc id="618303" wikidata="Q1362364" url="?curid=618303" title="Maiden flight">
<text>The maiden flight, also known as first flight, of an aircraft is the first occasion on which it leaves the ground under its own power. The same term is also used for the first launch of rockets.

In the early days of aviation it could be dangerous, because the exact handling characteristics of the aircraft were generally unknown. The maiden flight of a new type is almost invariably flown by a highly experienced test pilot. Maiden flights are usually accompanied by a chase plane, to verify items like altitude, airspeed, and general airworthiness.

A maiden flight is only one stage in the development of an aircraft type. Unless the type is a pure research aircraft (such as the X-15), the aircraft must be tested extensively to ensure that it delivers the desired performance with an acceptable margin of safety. In the case of civilian aircraft, a new type must be certified by a governing agency (such as the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States) before it can enter operation.

<doc id="618305" wikidata="Q4533085" url="?curid=618305" title="Pat (Saturday Night Live)">
<text>Pat O&#x27;Neill Riley is an androgynous fictional character created and performed by Julia Sweeney for the American sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) from 1990 to 1994. The character was later featured in the film &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot;. The central humorous aspect of sketches featuring Pat is the inability of others to determine the character&#x27;s gender.

== Background ==
Sweeney has said, &quot;I&#x27;d been an accountant for like five years, and there was one person I worked with in particular who had a lot of mannerisms like Pat. This person sort of drooled and had the kind of body language of Pat. I started trying to do him. I was testing it out on my friends and they were just like, &#x27;Yeah, it&#x27;s good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like a guy that much.&#x27; Like I couldn&#x27;t quite pull off being in drag convincingly enough. So then I thought, maybe &quot;that&quot;&#x27;s the joke. I&#x27;ll just have one joke in here about how we don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a man or a woman just to sort of cover up for my lack of ability to really play a guy convincingly.&quot;

== Physical appearance ==
Pat O&#x27;Neill Riley is fat, has short, curly black hair, and wears thick glasses. Pat typically wears a light-blue pearl-snap Western-style shirt with tan slacks.

In creating the character, actress Sweeney colored her lips beige, and colored in her eyebrows, to create the character&#x27;s sex-ambiguous appearance.

== Sketches ==
The sketches always revolve around the gag of Pat&#x27;s unrevealed gender: the name &quot;Pat&quot; can be short for &quot;Patricia&quot;, a female name, or &quot;Patrick&quot;, a male name. The celebrity guests on the show play everyday people who encounter Pat, and who then try to discern Pat&#x27;s gender, without being so rude as to actually ask outright. Pat remains oblivious, and endlessly frustrates the questioners with answers that leave Pat&#x27;s gender vague.

Pat often makes statements that seem to reveal a gender, only to then immediately confuse things again. A typical example might be, &quot;Sorry if I&#x27;m a little grumpy, I have really bad cramps... I rode my bike over here, and my calf muscles are &quot;killing&quot; me!&quot;. Some jokes would be a bit more buried, such as Pat remarking &quot;In high school I did well in drama, especially when I played the role of Peter Pan!&quot; (Many theatrical productions of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; feature a woman in the title role.) In another sketch, Pat tells Kevin Nealon that the name is Pat Riley (like the coach of the Lakers), only to add, &quot;but there&#x27;s one big difference between me and him... I never coached a professional basketball team. That&#x27;s my little joke!&quot;

Other gags include Pat&#x27;s attempts at humor, which serve to confuse everyone further: when asked what &quot;Pat&quot; is short for, the character replies, &quot;Pat is short for P-a-a-a-a-a-t!&quot;

=== Pat&#x27;s first appearance: &quot;Pat at the Office&quot; (Dec. 1990) ===
&quot;Pat&quot; debuted on December 1, 1990 (Season 16, Episode 7), with John Goodman hosting. In the sketch, Bill (Kevin Nealon) is thanking a friend over the phone for his new job, then asks whether Bill&#x27;s supervisor is a man or a woman. Before he gets an answer, he has to hang up when Pat enters. Bill asks, &quot;Do you have a boyf... girl... Are you married?&quot; Pat explains that Pat&#x27;s planned marriage to Chris fell through, because Chris got involved with Terry. (This answers nothing since Chris is an androgynous name and, and Pat could be saying &quot;Terry&quot; or &quot;Teri&quot;.) Next Bill says he&#x27;s trying to decide what to watch tonight: either a Giants-49ers game, or &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. Pat states an inability to help on that matter, having rented a film: &quot;Tootsie&quot;. Bill&#x27;s last effort, when they agree to go to lunch together, is to learn whether Pat has a wallet or a purse; Pat wears a fanny pack.

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat: Pat&#x27;s Significant Other&quot; (Feb. 1991) ===
Aired February 16, 1991 (Season 16, Episode 13). Again at the office, Roseanne Barr played Sue, who meets co-worker Pat. Dana Carvey, dressed androgynously, plays Pat&#x27;s love interest Chris, and Nealon reprised his role as Bill.

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat: Pat at the Drugstore&quot; (April. 1991) ===
Aired April 13, 1991 (Season 16, Episode 17). Catherine O&#x27;Hara played a drugstore clerk, who tries to help when Pat asks for disposable razors. O&#x27;Hara asks whether they would prefer a pink or blue package, but Pat says they will take whichever is cheaper. Next, they need a lotion for after shaving. The clerk offers a &quot;bracing tonic&quot; (for a man) or a &quot;soothing lotion&quot; (for a woman). Pat asks for Vaseline Intensive Care. The clerk says, &quot;Yes, everybody likes that.&quot; Next, Pat asks the increasingly nervous shop-woman for some antiperspirant. O&#x27;Hara, overwrought, asks, &quot;Roll-on or spray?&quot; Pat asks what is on sale. &quot;Secret&quot;, O&#x27;Hara says with faux joviality. &quot;Strong enough for a woman, but made for a man&quot; (transposing the slogan, &quot;Strong Enough for a Man, Made for a Woman&quot;). Pat makes one last purchase, for condoms; yet before O&#x27;Hara can draw the conclusion that Pat must be male, they proclaim, &quot;I think contraception is the responsibility of both partners. What can I say? I&#x27;m a very sexual being!&quot; The sketch ends when the clerk swoons out of sight behind her counter.

Sweeney wrote on her website, &quot;I lerve Catherine O&#x27;Hara!!!! I think I was as giddy to meet her as is possible for me. She was great fun on the show and in this sketch.&quot;

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat: Pat Goes to the Barber&quot; (May 1991) ===
Aired on May 18, 1991 (Season 16, Episode 20). When Pat goes to get a haircut, the hairdresser (George Wendt), has no idea whether to administer a male or female style. The stylist asks which magazine Pat would like to read, naming gender-specific titles (&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Glamour&quot;). In response, they ask for &quot;People&quot;. When they say the haircut is to look good for a party, the barber asks what they&#x27;ll be wearing, and they respond &quot;Black&quot;. The barber attempts to find out Pat&#x27;s sex by pointing to different prices for men and women displayed on the wall, but Pat simply gives him $20 and tells him to keep the change.

Julia Sweeney wrote, &quot;Christine Zander and I wrote this sketch about Pat – personally I think this is the very best one of all the Pat sketches. Pat goes into a barbershop to get a haircut and the barber is confused – is it going to be a man&#x27;s cut or a woman&#x27;s?&quot;

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat: Birthday Party&quot; (Oct. 1991) ===
Aired on October 12, 1991 (Season 17, Episode 3). Co-workers Siobhan Fallon Hogan, Phil Hartman, and Kevin Nealon give Pat a surprise birthday party. As they chat, Nealon asks whether Pat has a biological clock; Siobhan says, &quot;I think you&#x27;d make a really great moth... fath... role model,&quot; but Pat tells them about a dysfunctional family and unhappy childhood. Hartman makes the next attempt: &quot;Pat, would you say that you are more like your mother or your father?&quot;, but they reply, &quot;I&#x27;m a perfect combination of both!&quot; One of their estranged parents (Kirstie Alley), also androgynous and named Francis or Frances, comes into the party; when Nealon asks about Pat&#x27;s birth, again there are only ambiguous answers, as well as the parent saying &quot;I had to be both mother and father to you ever since (Jean or Gene) ran off with...that thing&quot;. The co-workers start to sing &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot;, but have to change &quot;he&#x27;s&quot; to &quot;Pat&#x27;s&quot;. Chris Rock had a minor role as a messenger.

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat: Pat Goes to the Gym&quot; (or &quot;Physical Evaluation&quot;) (Nov. 1991) ===
Aired November 16, 1991 (Season 17, Episode 6). Linda Hamilton was the host in this episode, in which Pat decides to join a gym. Gym employee Andrea (Hamilton) cannot figure out their sex, so, filling in the application form, she asks for &quot;age? ... height? ... sex?&quot; and looks up hopefully. Pat says, &quot;&#x27;Yes, please!&#x27; [stuttery laugh] That&#x27;s my little joke.&quot; When they are asked for a middle name, the eager audience then finds out that the middle name is &quot;O&#x27;Neill&quot;, again continuing the joke. (Pat never uses the middle name, as it is &quot;embarrassing&quot;.) Andrea keeps trying: &quot;Would you say that you&#x27;re in good health? Do you have regular periods...&quot; When Pat stares at her, Andrea hurriedly finishes, &quot;... of activity?&quot; Andrea tries again: &quot;What kind of body are you going for? I mean, do you want a muscular V-shape?&quot; (That would suggest Pat is male.) &quot;Or something a little more curvy?&quot; They reply, &quot;Well, I just saw the movie &quot;Return to the Blue Lagoon&quot;. I&#x27;d sure like a body like that!&quot; Andrea does not know whether they are referring to Milla Jovovich or Brian Krause. Andrea and fellow gym employee Ron (Tim Meadows) ask Pat which of them they would be more attracted to; Pat objects to the question; they suggest that Pat should go to the locker room. Just as the audience is about to see whether they enter either the men&#x27;s or the women&#x27;s, Kevin Nealon as a TV news anchor on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; interrupts with a Special Report alert. Upon returning to the Pat sketch, Andrea and Ron are laughing, with Andrea saying, &quot;I guess our question is finally answered!&quot;, but only the studio audience might have seen which door Pat entered; the television viewer is still in the dark.

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot;: Rob Morrow (Jan. 1992) ===
Aired on January 11, 1992 (Season 17, Episode 10) with Sweeney playing alongside Kevin Nealon as Bill, host Rob Morrow as Frank, Victoria Jackson as Dina, Dana Carvey and Mike Myers as guests, and Phil Hartman as the Narrator.

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat: Pat&#x27;s Interrogation&quot; (Apr. 1992) ===
Aired April 11, 1992 (Season 17, Episode 17). In honor of having Sharon Stone as the host, Pat is brought in for a &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; interrogation process. The interrogators are played by Chris Farley, Dana Carvey, and Phil Hartman. The questions are sexual in nature: &quot;Did you and Chris play any kind of games in bed?&quot; Pat replies, &quot;Role reversal! We felt it kept the relationship alive!&quot; When asked, &quot;Which one of you put on the condom?&quot;, Pat says, &quot;We put it on together.&quot; Hartman asks, &quot;if you were a baby, what color would your Pampers be, pink or blue?&quot; Pat sounds surprised: &quot;Diapers were all white back then!&quot; Interrogator #2 (Carvey, who usually played Chris) begins to rant: &quot;You&#x27;re lying, Pat, you&#x27;re lying! You&#x27;re not telling the truth, and by God I&#x27;m gonna find out! You&#x27;re not telling the truth, Pat, I&#x27;m gonna figure you out! I&#x27;m gonna figure you out!&quot;

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat: Pat Looks for a Roommate&quot; (Oct. 1992) ===
Aired October 10, 1992 (Season 18, Episode 3). The &quot;SNL&quot; cast wrote a spoof of the 1992 film &quot;Single White Female&quot;, in which Melanie Hutsell as Hedra, using a wig to look androgynous, plays a new roommate who becomes obsessed with wanting to look like and be like Pat. Other characters are played by David Spade as a prospective tenant who flees, Joe Pesci as Graham Knox, and Dana Carvey as Pat&#x27;s love interest Chris.

Graham tries to warn Pat about Hedra, but they cannot understand why anyone would obsess. &quot;Well, maybe she&#x27;s in love with you. Maybe she&#x27;s gay. Or, or straight. Or bi.&quot; Hedra enters, wearing the same clothes, glasses, and short curly hair as Pat&#x27;s. Graham says, &quot;Just look at the two of you. You look like bro... sist... twins.&quot;

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot;: Christopher Walken (Oct. 1992) ===
Aired October 24, 1992 (Season 18, Episode 4). Pat is hired by a new firm. Carl (Walken), an account executive, has returned to work from needing a leave for psychiatric problems. As the co-workers gather in the office, he expresses his extreme perplexity and discomfort around Pat to Phil Hartman. At last he is driven insane by the enigma of Pat and dives out the window.

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot;: Harvey Keitel (Jan. 1993) ===
Aired January 16, 1993 (Season 18, Episode 11). Harvey Keitel plays a shipwrecked sailor on a desert island, who has grown lonesome is then greeted by another castaway, who turns out to be Pat. Pat gives Pat&#x27;s typical ambiguity, telling of the situation where Pat was on a luxury cruise playing shuffleboard &quot;The battle of the sexes, and we won!&quot; when the ship was attacked by a violent storm and Pat was thrashed overboard and ended up on the sailor&#x27;s island. Although Keitel was made up to have some ambiguity such as long hair, it was obvious he was male as he wrote in his journal &quot;I miss the intimacy of a woman, or at least some good male companionship&quot;. Later, the sailor asks Pat what sex is Pat. When Pat is about to speak, Adam Sandler is in the audience, breaking the fourth wall. He tells Pat that NBC is going through hard times with the impending final episode of Cheers and the departure of David Letterman, and if Pat spoils the joke then &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; will be ruined because NBC will be bereft of all comedy.

Quentin Tarantino told &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1994, &quot;There was only one sketch that Julia Sweeney, the actress who plays Pat did on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that gave a clue to what Pat is. It was the sketch that Pat did with Harvey Keitel. And the thing is, they kissed in it. At one point they were thinking of taking the kiss out of the sketch. But Harvey, being Harvey, demanded they keep it in, that there&#x27;d be no integrity without the kiss. So that was the first time we&#x27;d seen Pat in an intimate situation – a smooch. There is a certain way that you hold your head, the way you come in for a kiss. And sitting there, watching it, I thought that Pat didn&#x27;t kiss like a guy. Pat kissed like a girl.&quot;

=== &quot;Pat&#x27;s Crying Game&quot; (Mar. 1993) ===
Aired March 20, 1993 (Season 18, Episode 16). In a spoof of the movie &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, Pat sings the title song.

=== May 1994 ===
Aired on May 14, 1994 (Season 19, Episode 20). Pat appears at the end of the episode, alongside other recurring characters, singing &quot;So Long, Farewell&quot;.

== Reception of the &quot;SNL&quot; character ==
A writer for &quot;Splitsider&quot; wrote, &quot;While she brought plenty of squeaky energy to her four-year stint at &quot;SNL&quot;, Julia Sweeney is known best for creating the most unnerving character in the show&#x27;s history, the sex-unspecific nerd Pat. With fourteen &quot;SNL&quot; appearances, not to mention an Emmy Awards ceremony cameo and 1994 feature film, the grating, whiny, yet perennially enigmatic Pat continues to be hailed as one of the show&#x27;s most annoying — and oddly groundbreaking — recurring characters. In fact, &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s recurring character mold, as well as male/female cast member divide, would have gone largely untested without Pat&#x27;s existence. And for a featured player whose first year was spent in an overcrowded cast with 13 men and a mere 3 women, perhaps Sweeney sensed that a joke on the sex issue was the best way to get around it. Whatever the case, Pat&#x27;s smarmy, pleading face will, for better or worse, remain the thing on &quot;SNL&quot; for which Sweeney is most remembered... Pat was a creepy yet instant recurring character hit...&quot;

Pat was selected as #17 of &quot;The 30 Best &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Characters&quot; by &quot;Paste&quot; magazine in 2012: &quot;Pat is probably a woman, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter. Call her Patrick, call him Patricia. Just don&#x27;t mistake him for the coach of a professional basketball team—or ask her middle name or any sex identifying questions for that matter. It won&#x27;t affect Pat, it&#x27;ll just drive you crazy.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
Years after the sketches aired, Joey Soloway said they felt the premise and character were painful to non-binary and transgender people. Responding to Soloway&#x27;s comments in 2019, Sweeney acknowledged that today &quot;you would not make fun of somebody for being that way&quot; and that the character was a bygone of &quot;a whole other world.&quot;

The 2019 Showtime television show &quot;Work in Progress&quot; has suggested that the character was troublesome to non-binary and transgender people.

== Feature film: &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; ==
The character&#x27;s popularity gave rise to a feature-length 1994 film called &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; (from the lyrics of the character&#x27;s theme song on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;). Quentin Tarantino did an uncredited rewrite of the script. The film was a critical and commercial bomb.

Julia Sweeney wrote on her &quot;Pat&quot; website, &quot;I wrote &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; with Jim Emerson and Steve Hibbert. We had a great time writing and a lot of fun making the film. The movie didn&#x27;t do well at the box office, not by a long shot. In fact, &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; became a popular example of a film so despised that it got a zero percent Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess in that way, it&#x27;s sort of a badge of honor.But I can&#x27;t help it, I love this film. It has so many people in it who I love, and loved. Many are dead: Charlie Rocket, who played Kyle, and Julie Hayden who played his wife (who died of cancer a couple of years after the film premiered,) my dad who played the priest who married us, and my brother Mike who had one line at the wedding shower of Pat and Chris. And there are so many good friends in the film too: Kathy Griffin and Dave Foley and Kathy Najimy and Tim Stack and Tim Meadows. And the band Ween! We had so much fun together.&quot;

=== Plot ===
Pat meets Chris, another sexually-ambiguous character, played by Dave Foley. (On &quot;SNL&quot;, Chris had been played by Dana Carvey.) They quickly fall in love, and they propose to each other at exactly the same time. Before the wedding, Chris breaks up with Pat due to Pat&#x27;s arrogance and lack of direction in life; Pat has a brief stint in a rock band, and Pat starts to believe that they are going to be an overnight celebrity. Meanwhile, Pat has become an object of obsession of a neighbor (Charles Rocket), who is so determined to discover Pat&#x27;s sex that he goes insane. Pat&#x27;s sex is never revealed in the film. At the end of the film, Pat and Chris are reunited, and, in an epilogue, they marry.

=== Book ===
Sweeney helped co-write &quot;It&#x27;s Pat!: My Life Exposed&quot;, a book which coincided with the film&#x27;s release. Pat&#x27;s sex is not revealed within its 96 pages.

==Pat&#x27;s gender==
The character has been described as &quot;hermaphroditic&quot; in the book &quot;The Guide to United States Popular Culture&quot;. The book &quot;Creating Contexts for Learning and Self-authorship: Constructive-developmental Pedagogy&quot;, states that the character&#x27;s &quot;gender is never revealed&quot;. Sweeney herself has not confirmed Pat&#x27;s gender and denies that Pat is transgender.

Norm Macdonald said that after he joined the show, on the night the cast watched the debut of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, Farley &quot;said &#x27;I gotta tell you a secret about &quot;SNL&quot;″ ... He secreted me into this room, he locked it, made sure it wasn&#x27;t bugged and everything ... I was very honored to have this. And then his secret was, he said, &#x27;This doesn&#x27;t go past these walls. &quot;Pat…IS A WOMAN!&quot;&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="618309" wikidata="Q7581337" url="?curid=618309" title="Sprockets (Saturday Night Live)">
<text>Sprockets was a recurring comedy sketch from the NBC television series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, created by and starring comedian Mike Myers as the host of a fictional West German television talk show. The sketch parodied German art culture in the 1980s.

==Development==
The sketch parodied German stereotypes, especially those pertaining to German seriousness, efficiency, and precision. Originally created for the Toronto company of the Second City comedy troupe, Myers later imported the character to television for the Canadian sketch comedy show &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and the American sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Myers played &quot;Dieter&quot;, a bored, disaffected West German expressionist and minimalist who interviewed celebrities in whom he was demonstrably barely interested. He invariably sought to bring the discussion around to his &quot;limited&quot; monkey, Klaus, seated on a platform atop a miniature column. Myers has stated he based the character on a waiter he encountered, working at The Cameron House in Toronto, as well as German musician Klaus Nomi (after whom said monkey was named). Appearing effeminate (in his 1997 return as host Myers introduced his lover Helmut, played by Will Ferrell), Myers&#x27; &quot;Dieter&quot; costume consisted of black tights with a matching turtleneck sweater, round wire-rimmed glasses, and slicked-back hair.

On several occasions, the sketch featured a section titled &quot;Germany&#x27;s Most Disturbing Home Videos&quot;. This showcased such scenes as an old man&#x27;s head spinning around; a fat man, clad only in a diaper, cavorting in a lawn sprinkler; a man throwing up after being kicked in the genitals; the seemingly-lifeless body of a tramp whose face is covered with ants; and a man&#x27;s trousers falling down in public, while he and his girlfriend are viewing an art gallery (the man is wearing a thong). The sketch typically ended with Myers declaring, &quot;Now&#x27;s the time on &quot;Sprockets&quot; when we dance!&quot; and performing a jerky, robotic dance with several male stagehands who were similarly dressed in black tights and turtlenecks.

The theme song for the sketch was Kraftwerk&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Electric Café&quot; from a 33 RPM LP record which was sped up by playing it back at 45 RPM.

Some later sketches featured Dieter outside of his talk show environment starring in parodies of game shows, TV dance parties, and art films.

== Quotations from Dieter ==
* &quot;Your presence intimidates me to the point of humiliation. Would you care to strike me?&quot;
* &quot;That film/poem looks at me while I&#x27;m naked, and calls its friends.&quot;
* &quot;I feel emotionally obliterated.&quot;
* &quot;That poem/film pulls down my pants and makes fun of me. But not in a malicious way.&quot;
* &quot;You have disturbed me almost to the point of insanity...There. I am insane now.&quot;
* &quot;I am filled with anticipation/remorse, and it is most delicious.&quot;
* &quot;Touch my monkey.&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m as happy as a little girl.&quot;

==Cancelled film adaptation==
The sketch was to be used as the basis for a feature-length film titled &quot;Dieter&#x27;s Day&quot;, which was to be directed by production designer Bo Welch (of both &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; fame) in his directorial debut and to star Myers alongside Will Ferrell, David Hasselhoff and Jack Black, but the project was cancelled in June 2000 after Myers became dissatisfied with his own script. Less than a week after Myers informed Universal Pictures of his decision, the studio sued Myers for their $3.8 million spent in pre-production costs. One month later, Myers was hit with a second lawsuit, this time from Imagine Entertainment, which claimed that &quot;He [Myers] claimed he had not approved the screenplay. Who wrote the screenplay--Myers,&quot; Imagine claims Myers backed out after it and Universal agreed to his demands for more pay and millions of dollars were spent in pre-production. &quot;This was not the first time Myers engaged in such conduct,&quot; the suit contended. &quot;He has followed a pattern and practice of breaking his promises, betraying the trust of others and causing serious damage to those with whom he deals through selfish, egomaniacal and irresponsible conduct.&quot; The Imagine lawsuit sought more than $30 million in actual damages plus punitive damages. Myers subsequently countersued both parties and both lawsuits were later settled out of court, whereupon Myers and Welch agreed to make another film with both Universal and Imagine as replacement for the &quot;Dieter&quot; film; that film became &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, which was directed by Welch, starred Myers as the titular character, and was released three years later in 2003.

<text>Ernest Marc Louis de Gonzague Doudart de Lagrée (; 31 March 1823 – 12 March 1868) was the leader of the French Mekong Expedition of 1866-1868.

He was born in Saint-Vincent-de-Mercuze near Grenoble, France, and graduated from the École Polytechnique. He joined the French Navy and served in the Crimean War, then took up a post in Indochina in the hope that the climate would help his chronically ulcerated throat. It did not, and throughout the Mekong expedition he was often in severe pain.

The expedition left Saigon on 5 June 1866. In addition to his ulcers, Doudart de Lagrée suffered from fever, amoebic dysentery and infected wounds caused by leeches, as the expeditioners had to walk barefoot once they had worn out their supply of shoes. By the time the expedition reached Dongchuan, in Yunnan, China, he was too sick to be moved, and his second-in-command Francis Garnier took command. Garnier led the expedition to Dali, leaving Doudart de Lagrée in the care of the doctor. He died from an abscess on his liver. The doctor removed his heart to return it to France, while Doudart de Lagrée was buried in Dongchuan.

Ernest Doudart de Lagrée was also an entomologist. Insect collections made by him in Africa are conserved in Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle in Paris.

== Honours ==
* Three ships of the French Navy were named in his honour, notably the &quot;Doudart de Lagrée&quot; (F 728)
* Three stamps of French Indochina were issued in his honour in 1944–45, in the values of 1, 15 and 40 centimes.

<text>Nathan Edward Cook (October 10, 1885 – September 10, 1992) was a sailor in the United States Navy during the Philippine–American War whose naval career continued through the Second World War. When he died at the age of 106 he was the oldest surviving American war veteran, and the last verified veteran of the Boxer Rebellion.

==Biography==

===Military career===
Cook was born on October 10, 1885, in Hersey, Michigan. He left a 50-cent-a-day job at a packing plant in a city from Kansas. He lied about his age (then 15) in order to join the Navy on April 9, 1901, after he saw a recruiting poster which said, &quot;Join the Navy and See the World.&quot; He was assigned to the USS &quot;Pensacola&quot;.

He served during the Philippine–American War, which began shortly after Spain had ceded the Philippines to the United States after losing the Spanish–American War of 1898. The Philippine–American War lasted from 1899 until July 4, 1902 – one year after Cook&#x27;s enlistment in the Navy.

Cook also saw service in the Boxer Rebellion and clashes along the U.S.–Mexico border.

After 12 and a half years of service as an enlisted man, he was appointed to the warrant officer rank of boatswain on January 11, 1913.

During the First World War he commanded a submarine chaser that sank two German U-boats.

Cook was promoted on August 15, 1918, to the temporary rank of lieutenant and was given command of the tugboat USS &quot;Favorite&quot; on the 21st of the same month.

Cook received a letter of commendation from the Secretary of the Navy for his role in salvaging the USS &quot;Narragansett&quot; in February 1919. The text of his commendation reads: &quot;As Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. &quot;Favorite&quot; he took a conspicuous and creditable part in the operation of salvaging the U.S.S. &quot;Narragansett&quot;.&quot;

After the First World War, Cook was reduced to his permanent rank of Boatswain and then promoted to Chief Boatswain on January 11, 1919.

During the early days of World War II, Cook was stationed at Port-au-Prince Haiti and in Panama. As of November 1, 1940 he was the executive officer of the SS &quot;Mormacyork&quot; which served as a transport between the United States and South America.

Cook retired on April 1, 1942, after 40 years in the Navy. He was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant the same day in recognition of his service in the First World War. He once said his Navy life was tough but that it beat living on his Missouri farm. During his naval career, Cook&#x27;s shipmates nicknamed him &quot;Northeast,&quot; derived from his first two initials.

===Personal life===
Cook&#x27;s father, William Cook, had died in 1895. His mother Ellen later remarried and the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri.

Cook met his wife, Elizabeth (1887–1982) in New York in 1901 and they married on October 29, 1905. Elizabeth died two weeks before what would have been their 77th wedding anniversary in 1982. Cook spent his last years at the residential section of the VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona and was buried beside his wife at the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona.

==Legacy==

Cook was the last living member of the United Spanish War Veterans (USWV). The USWV was an organization of veterans of the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War who had served between 1898 and 1902. Cook was eligible to be a member of the USWV because he had enlisted during the Philippine–American War.

Cook was often referred to as a veteran of the Spanish–American War, but the Spanish–American War officially ended in August 1898 and Cook did not enlist in the Navy until April 1901. Because Cook was a member of the USWV, many assumed that he was a Spanish–American War veteran.

Cook was mistakenly recognized as the longest surviving U.S. veteran of that war at the time of his death in 1992 (although there is a claim that Jones Morgan was a Spanish–American War veteran and survived longer). Cook was, however, likely the last surviving veteran of the Philippine–American War.

When Cook turned 104, he received a congratulatory letter from George H. W. Bush and guests watched a video presentation about his life. Cook&#x27;s younger daughter, Eleanor Kay of Tempe, Arizona, also said around this time: &quot;He was a Navy man throughout. Navy. Navy. Navy. He lived for the Navy. Yes, he had a wife and family, and he enjoyed coming home to see them. But he also enjoyed getting back to his ship.&quot;

<text>Banya (, ) is a village in southeastern Bulgaria, situated in the Nesebar Municipality of the Burgas Province. It is situated at the foot of the Eastern part of the Balkan Mountains, 6 km from the Black Sea Coast.

Banya is 18 km away from Sunny beach (the largest Bulgarian sea resort), 25 km from the ancient Nesebar and 50 km from Burgas and Varna - the biggest Bulgarian administrative centres on the Black Sea Coast. Within the village itself is a small restaurant and bar, a couple of shops and a hotel. The village hall was recently demolished and is currently in the process of being rebuilt.

The village has been populated by Turkish coal merchants and Greek fishermen until the 1910s. Gradually, the original inhabitants have been evicted and Bulgarian refugees from Asia Minor coast and the Aegean Macedonia moved in.

Irakli, the nearest beach, is one of the last remaining non-commercially developed beaches in Bulgaria. It is a place of unparalleled and unspoilt beauty, a lush fine sandy beach of nearly 4 km, backed by low shrubbery and forest growth.

Frequented by an &#x27;in-crowd&#x27; in the summer months it is largely deserted October to May.

Recently an influx of expats, mainly from the UK, but also some from Germany, The Netherlands and also as far afield as Australia, started shaping a small community - currently numbering about 10 families, some of them permanent settlers.

<text>Obzor ( ) is a small town and seaside resort on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria. It is part of Nesebar Municipality, Burgas Province. On February 28, 2021, the citizens of Obzor and six nearby villages voted in a referendum to separate from Nesebar Municipality and form an independent municipality, centered on Obzor. Voting activity was 76.02% and approximately 70% of people voted for independence.

The Thracian and ancient Greek name of Obzor was &#x27;. It was a small port on the coast of Thrace, a colony of Mesembria. The ancient Romans named it &quot;Templum Iovis&quot; (Temple of Jupiter); Pliny called it Tetranaulochus&quot;&quot;&#x27;. During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, it was known as &quot;Gözeken&quot;. The modern name was introduced in 1936; Obzor obtained town privileges on 9 September 1984.

The 2200-m-long Kaleto eco path () connects the northwestern outskirts of Obzor with the remains of a medieval fortress. Visitors can see a 10-m-high waterfall and a mineral spring along the trail.

<doc id="618347" wikidata="Q312817" url="?curid=618347" title="E. M. Antoniadi">
<text>Eugène Michel Antoniadi (Greek: Ευγένιος Αντωνιάδης; 1 March 1870 – 10 February 1944) was a Greek-French astronomer. He is known for creating the Antoniadi scale as well as for his observations of the planets, and was a major opponent of the notion of Martian canals. He created some very detailed maps of Mars and many features on the planet are still known by the names he suggested. He also created the first map of Mercury, though it turned out to be incorrect.

== Biography ==
Antoniadi was born in Istanbul (Constantinople) but spent most of his adult life in France after being invited there by Camille Flammarion.

He became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 10 February 1899, and in 1890 he became one of the founding members of the British Astronomical Association (BAA). In 1892, he joined the BAA&#x27;s Mars Section and became that section&#x27;s Director in 1896.

He became a member of the Société astronomique de France (SAF) in 1891.

Flammarion hired Antoniadi to work as an assistant astronomer in his private observatory in Juvisy-sur-Orge in 1893.
Antoniadi worked there for nine years. In 1902, he resigned from both the Juvisy observatory and from SAF.

Antoniadi rejoined SAF in 1909. That same year, Henri Deslandres, Director of the Meudon Observeratory, provided him with access to the &quot;Grande Lunette&quot; (83-cm Great Refractor)
He became a highly reputed observer of Mars, and at first supported the notion of Martian canals, but after using the 83 centimeter telescope at Meudon Observatory during the 1909 opposition of Mars, he came to the conclusion that canals were an optical illusion. He also observed Venus and Mercury.
He made the first map of Mercury, but his maps were flawed by his incorrect assumption that Mercury had synchronous rotation with the Sun. The first standard nomenclature for Martian albedo features was introduced by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) when they adopted 128 names from the 1929 map of Antoniadi named &quot;La Planète Mars&quot;.

He is also famed for creating the Antoniadi scale of seeing, which is commonly used by amateur astronomers. He was also a strong chess player. His best result was equal first with Frank Marshall in a tournament in Paris in 1907, a point ahead of Savielly Tartakower.

He died in Paris, aged almost 74.

== Name ==
His full name was Eugène Michel Antoniadi (), however he was also known as Eugenios Antoniadis. His name is also sometimes given as Eugène Michael Antoniadi or even (incorrectly) as Eugène Marie Antoniadi.

== Awards and honors ==
* 1925 - Prix Jules Janssen from the Société astronomique de France.
* 1926 – Prix Guzman of 2,500 Francs from the Académie des Sciences.
* 1932 - Prix La Caille from the Académie des Sciences. 
* 1970 - Antoniadi crater on the Moon named in his honor by the International Astronomical Union.
* 1973 - Antoniadi crater on Mars named in his honor by the International Astronomical Union.
* 1976 - Antoniadi Dorsum wrinkle ridge on Mercury named in his honor by the International Astronomical Union.

== Publications ==
Antoniadi was a prolific writer of articles and books (the Astrophysics Data System lists nearly 230 that he authored or co-authored). The subjects included astronomy, history, and architecture. He frequently wrote articles for &quot;L&#x27;Astronomie&quot; of the Société astronomique de France, &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;, and the &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot;, among others.

Notable works include:

* &quot;Sur une Anomalie de la phase dichotome de la planète Vénus&quot; (Paris: Gauthier-Villars, (s. d.)).
* &quot;La planète Mars, 1659-1929&quot; (Paris: Hermann &amp; Cie, 1930).
* &quot;La Planète Mercure et la rotation des satellites. Etude basée sur les résultats obtenus avec la grande lunette de l&#x27;observatoire de Meudon&quot; (Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1934).

<text>Radio Flyer is an American toy company best known for its popular red toy wagon. Radio Flyer also produces scooters, tricycles, bicycles, horses, and ride-ons. The company was founded in 1917 and is based in Chicago, Illinois.

==History==

Antonio Pasin immigrated to the United States from Italy in 1914 when he was 16 years old. He started building wooden toy wagons in Chicago in 1917, selling them to area shops. He was working as a craftsman at the time, mostly selling phonograph cabinets, and built small wooden wagons to carry around his tools. After he received numerous requests from customers of phonograph cabinets to buy the wagons as well, he refocused his business on the wagons. His business grew until the &quot;Liberty Coaster Company&quot;, named in honour of the Statue of Liberty, was formed in 1923. The demands for these original wooden wagons, dubbed the &quot;Liberty Coaster,&quot; quickly outpaced production. Incorporating the mass manufacturing techniques of the auto industry, Pasin began making metal wagons out of stamped steel in 1927. At around that time, the red wagons sold for slightly less than $3, or about $40 in 2016 dollars.

In 1930, the company was renamed &quot;Radio Steel &amp; Manufacturing&quot;. The renamed company produced steel-bodied wagons and used assembly line manufacturing techniques. The new &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; wagons were named as a tribute to two famous men of the day: Marconi and Lindbergh. Italian inventor and engineer Guglielmo Marconi developed, demonstrated, and marketed the first successful long-distance wireless telegraph and in 1901 broadcast the first transatlantic radio signal. Charles Lindbergh completed the first solo, non-stop flight across the Atlantic in 1927. Combining those two marvels, Pasin christened his new metal wagons &quot;Radio Flyer&quot;.

In 1933, Pasin set up a large manufacturing facility on Grand Avenue in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood. That year, Chicago was the host of the World&#x27;s Fair, Century of Progress, and Radio Steel was asked to be a part of the celebration. Antonio Pasin took on major debt to fund the construction of a tall wood and plaster Coaster Boy statue depicting a boy riding a Liberty Coaster wagon. Below the Coaster Boy exhibit Pasin sold miniatures for 25 cents. During World War II, steel was essential war material; from 1942–1945, the company shifted production to portable five gallon &quot;Blitz cans&quot; for the US Army.

In 1987, Radio Steel changed its name to Radio Flyer after its popular flagship little red wagon. Pasin died in 1990, and his grandson, Robert Pasin, has been CEO since 1997. Today, the company produces a wide range of children&#x27;s products, including scooters, tricycles, ride-ons, horses, battery ops, and wagons.

In 2015, Fortune named Radio Flyer number one in the top 25 best small businesses for which to work.

==The wagon==

The Liberty Coaster Company began producing the wooden bodied &quot;No. 4 Liberty Coaster&quot; in 1923. In 1927, Pasin replaced the wooden body with stamped steel, taking advantage of assembly line manufacturing techniques and earning him the nickname &quot;Little Ford&quot;. 1500 wagons a day rolled off assembly lines even during the Great Depression. Since 2002, the company has produced plastic as well as metal-bodied wagons.

A number of designs and styles have been produced by Radio Flyer, often inspired by the automobiles or popular culture of the day. The &quot;Zephyr&quot;, produced in the 1930s, paid homage to the Chrysler Airflow. The 1950s saw a yellow wagon inspired by the movie &quot;Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier&quot; and a blue wagon produced in partnership with Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. Wagons from the 1970s borrowed the stylings of the muscle cars of the day, including the &quot;Fireball 2001&quot; inspired by Evel Knievel. The 1990s saw the introduction of the &quot;Quad Shock Wagon&quot; echoing sport utility vehicles. The &quot;Ultimate Family Wagon&quot;, introduced in 2007, includes a sunshade and an adjustable seat; the design won a Chicago Innovation Award in 2007.

The Radio Flyer Wagon was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York in 1999, and its creator, Antonio Pasin, was inducted into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame in 2003.

==Radio Flyer Tricycle==
The Radio Flyer Tricycle features the same bright red color and graphics as the little red wagon.

<doc id="618368" wikidata="Q3269452" url="?curid=618368" title="Gustaf Philip Creutz">
<text>Count Gustaf Philip Creutz (; 1 May 1731 in Anjala, Finland – 30 October 1785 in Stockholm), was a Swedish statesman, diplomat and poet.

==Biography==
Creutz was born in Finland and after concluding his studies at the Royal Academy of Turku he received a post in the Privy Council Chancery at Stockholm in 1751. Here he met Count Gustaf Fredrik Gyllenborg, with whom his name is indissolubly connected. They were closely allied with Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, and their works were published in common; to their own generation they seemed equal in fame, but posterity has given the palm of genius to Creutz.

His greatest work is contained in the 1762 volume, the idyll of &quot;Atis och Camilla&quot;; the exquisite little pastoral entitled &quot;Daphne&quot; was published at the same time, and Gyllenborg was the first to proclaim the supremacy of his friend.

In 1763, Creutz practically closed his poetical career; he went to Spain as ambassador, and after three years to Paris in the same capacity until May 1783, and it was during this time that Creutz met with the American resident in Paris at the time, Benjamin Franklin. Creutz and Franklin drafted the first Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the two nations.

In 1783, King Gustav III of Sweden recalled him and heaped honours upon him, but he died soon after. In 1784, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

&quot;Atis och Camilla&quot; was long the most admired poem in the Swedish language; it is written in a spirit of pastoral which is now to some degree faded, but in comparison with most of the other productions of the time it is freshness itself. Creutz introduced a melody and grace into the Swedish tongue which it lacked before, and he has been styled the last artificer of the language.

<doc id="618376" wikidata="Q316187" url="?curid=618376" title="Eli Manning">
<text>Elisha Nelson Manning (born January 3, 1981) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons with the New York Giants. A member of the Manning family, he is the youngest son of Archie and younger brother of Peyton. Manning played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels, winning the Maxwell and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm awards as a senior. He was selected first overall in the 2004 NFL draft by the San Diego Chargers and traded to the Giants during the draft.

Manning&#x27;s greatest professional success was twice leading the Giants to underdog Super Bowl victories against the New England Patriots dynasty in Super Bowl XLII and Super Bowl XLVI. The former, which saw the wild card Giants defeat a Patriots team that was the first to win all 16 regular season games, is regarded as one of the greatest sports upsets of all time. Manning was named Super Bowl MVP in both championships, making him one of six players to receive the award multiple times.

As the Giants starting quarterback from 2004 to 2019, Manning holds the franchise records for passing yards, passing touchdowns, and completions. Never missing a game due to injury, he started 210 consecutive games from 2004 to 2017, the third-longest consecutive starts streak by an NFL quarterback. Manning ranks 11th all-time in passing yards and 10th in touchdowns.

==Early life==
Manning was born in New Orleans, the youngest of three boys to Olivia (née Williams) and NFL quarterback Elisha Archibald &quot;Archie&quot; Manning III, both natives of Mississippi. His older brothers, Cooper and Peyton, both played football growing up.

Manning attended high school at the Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, where he played football and basketball for the Greenies. In his high school career, Manning passed for a school-record 7,389 yards and 89 touchdowns. Eli&#x27;s passing mark was later broken by his nephew Arch in 2022. He committed to play college football at the University of Mississippi.

==College career==

Manning entered college in the shadow of his brother Peyton, quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts, and his father, who was considered a legend and folk hero at Ole Miss. During his years with the Rebels, Manning set or tied numerous single-game, season and career records. His career numbers include 10,119 passing yards (fifth on the SEC career list), 81 touchdown passes (third on the SEC career list), and a passer rating of 137.7 (tied for sixth on the SEC career list).

===2000 season===

As a redshirt freshman, Manning competed with veteran Romaro Miller for the starting quarterback position and saw little playing time. He appeared in six games and passed for 170 total yards and one interception in the Rebels 7–5 season.

===2001 season===

With the departure of Miller, Manning became the Rebels&#x27; starting quarterback as a sophomore. In the first game, against Murray State, he converted 20-of-23 pass attempts for 271 yards and five passing touchdowns in the 49–14 victory. In the following game, a 27–21 loss to Auburn, he had 265 passing yards, one passing touchdown and one interception. Over the next few games, Manning helped lead the Rebels to victories over Kentucky, Alabama and LSU. On November 3, in a 58–56 7OT loss to Arkansas, Manning passed for 312 passing yards and six passing touchdowns. The game marked the longest game in major college football history at the time. Overall, Manning had a solid first year as the Rebels&#x27; starting quarterback with 2,948 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and nine interceptions, as the Rebels finished with a 7–4 record.

===2002 season===

Manning&#x27;s junior season started out promising with a 31–3 victory over Louisiana-Monroe and a 38–16 victory over Memphis. Manning had four passing touchdowns and one interception combined in those two games. In the next game, a 42–28 loss to Texas Tech, Manning passed for 374 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. The Rebels won their next three games, which were over Vanderbilt, #6 Florida and Arkansas State to earn Ole Miss a #21 ranking in the AP Poll. Manning had five touchdowns and one interception in that stretch. The Rebels&#x27; fortunes turned in the latter half of the season with a five-game losing streak. In the stretch was a 48–28 loss to Arkansas, in which Manning completed 42-of-56 passes for 414 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. In addition, he had a rushing touchdown. Manning&#x27;s 414 passing yards marked the most he threw for in college. After a 24–12 win over rival Mississippi State, the Rebels qualified for the Independence Bowl with a 6–6 record to face off against Nebraska. Manning passed for 313 yards and one touchdown in the 27–23 victory. Overall, Manning finished with 3,401 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions in his junior season.

===2003 season===

Manning started off his senior season with a 2–2 record. He played well in that stretch with 1,329 passing yards, 11 touchdowns and four interceptions, with victories over Vanderbilt and Louisiana-Monroe, but had losses to Memphis and Texas Tech. The Rebels went on a six-game winning streak that included victories over major SEC opponents #24 Florida, Alabama, #21 Arkansas, South Carolina, and Auburn. Manning passed for 1,552 yards, 12 touchdowns, and four interceptions in the winning streak. Overall, he led the Rebels to a 10–3 record, and a 31–28 SBC Cotton Bowl Classic victory over #21 Oklahoma State, with 259 passing yards and two touchdowns in 2003. Manning helped lead Ole Miss to their first ten-win season since 1971.

As his senior year came to a close, Manning won many awards, including the Maxwell Award as the nation&#x27;s best all-around player, the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame Scholar-Athlete Award, the Sporting News Radio Socrates Award, and the SEC Most Valuable Player Award. He was also a candidate for the 2003 Heisman Trophy, finishing third in the voting after winning quarterback Jason White (University of Oklahoma) and wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald (University of Pittsburgh). Manning was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity (as was his father), and he was named Sigma Nu Athlete of the Year in 2001 and 2003.

Manning graduated from the University of Mississippi with a degree in marketing and a GPA of 3.44 and was on the Dean&#x27;s Honor Roll.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
The San Diego Chargers had the first overall pick in the 2004 NFL draft due to their 4–12 record in 2003. With Manning being the most coveted player in the draft, it appeared that the Chargers&#x27; intentions were to draft him first overall. Meanwhile, Manning and his father Archie Manning stated that he would refuse to play for the Chargers if drafted by them. Archie asked the father of former Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf before the draft about his son&#x27;s experience with the team. In hearing that the Chargers did not help Leaf with his personal problems, it then became part of why Eli refused to play for the team.

The Chargers selected Manning with the first pick overall nonetheless, as the team had a deal with the New York Giants, whereby the Giants would draft and then trade Philip Rivers and a 2004 third-round pick, used to select placekicker Nate Kaeding; a 2005 first-round pick, used to select linebacker Shawne Merriman; and a 2005 fifth-round pick (which was later traded away) to the Chargers for Manning. He signed a six-year, $45 million contract with the Giants.

Manning was one of 17 quarterbacks taken in the 2004 NFL Draft, along with Rivers and the Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; Ben Roethlisberger. All three would enjoy lengthy and successful careers with the teams that signed them and have been compared favorably to the 1983 NFL draft, which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks John Elway, Jim Kelly, and Dan Marino. Manning posted the lowest passing yards, touchdowns, pass completions, completion percentage, TD–INT ratio, passer rating, wins, winning percentage, and Pro Bowl honors of the three, but cemented his legacy with his two upset Super Bowl victories against the New England Patriots&#x27; dynasty. While both Manning and Roethlisberger were part of two Super Bowl-winning teams, Manning is the only quarterback of the three to earn Super Bowl MVP honors, which he received in both victories.

===2004 season===

Manning made his NFL regular season debut in Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles. He came into the game toward the end the fourth quarter in relief of Kurt Warner. He finished the 31–17 loss 3-of-9 for 66 yards. Manning made his first career regular season start against the Atlanta Falcons at Giants Stadium on November 21, 2004. In the game, Manning threw his first career touchdown on a six-yard pass to Jeremy Shockey in the third quarter. In his fourth start, against the Baltimore Ravens at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on December 12, 2004, he ended the day with a 0.0 passer rating and was benched in the second half in favor of Warner, but remained the Giants starter through the end of the season. In Week 15, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he recorded his first multi-touchdown performance with 182 passing yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the 33–30 loss in a duel with fellow rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. In the regular season finale, Manning passed for 144 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 28–24 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, getting his first win as a starter. The Giants finished with a 6–10 record and were 1–6 in games that Manning started in. He finished with 1,043 passing yards, six touchdowns, and nine interceptions.

===2005 season: NFC East champions===

Following 2004, Warner left the Giants, and Manning was named the starter for 2005. Manning led the Giants to a 2–0 record with victories against the Arizona Cardinals and New Orleans Saints, before traveling to the West Coast for a test in a road game against the San Diego Chargers. Chargers fans did not forget the snub, and on September 25, 2005, when Manning and the Giants made their first trip to San Diego for a game since that draft day, the crowd booed Manning loudly every time he touched the ball. San Diego defeated the Giants 45–23, but Manning displayed what may have been his most impressive performance of his young career, going 24-of-41 for 352 yards and two touchdowns.

Manning returned home to throw for almost 300 yards and a career-high four touchdowns against the St. Louis Rams at Giants Stadium in a 44–24 romp. Two games later, he led a last-minute drive against the Denver Broncos to secure a 24–23 victory for the Giants. The drive culminated in a two-yard touchdown to Amani Toomer with five seconds remaining. Two weeks later, Manning overcame a weak first half against the San Francisco 49ers to help his team secure their first official road victory of the season, 24–6. Despite a poor performance at home against the Minnesota Vikings, throwing four interceptions, he again led his team back to tie the game in the final minutes before the Vikings won on a late field goal.

Manning finished among the top five quarterbacks in both passing yards and touchdown passes, while leading an offense that finished third in the NFL in scoring with a total of 422 points. It was the most points the Giants scored in a single season since 1963. The Giants won the NFC East with an 11–5 record and advanced to the postseason as the #4-seed. In the Wild Card Round against the Carolina Panthers, Manning was 10-of-18 for 113 yards and three interceptions in the 23–0 loss.

===2006 season===

Manning&#x27;s second full season was reminiscent of his 2005 season. He started off playing well and completed over 65 percent of his passes through the first four games. However, he struggled in the second half of the season and his production diminished towards the end of the regular season. After losing a tough game to his brother Peyton and the Indianapolis Colts on opening day, Manning and the Giants rebounded from a 24–7 fourth quarter deficit en route to a 30–24 overtime victory over the division rival Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. Manning threw for a career-high 371 yards in the win with three touchdowns including a game-winning pass to Plaxico Burress in overtime to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Following a poor performance against the Seattle Seahawks the next week, Manning and the Giants responded by winning five straight games including wins over the Washington Redskins, Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons, to push their record to 6–2.

Following this winning streak, key injuries including one to wide receiver Amani Toomer pushed Manning and the Giants into a downward slide. Playing against the Chicago Bears, Manning started well, but the Giants&#x27; offense was derailed by the loss of left tackle Luke Petitgout to a broken leg. Manning was held to only 141 yards passing with two interceptions. Petitgout&#x27;s loss left a gaping hole at the crucial left tackle position, and Manning was unable to repeat his first-half success. Manning struggled the next week against the Jacksonville Jaguars and the week after that, a costly interception helped to culminate a huge collapse on the road against the Tennessee Titans, with the Giants seeing a 21-point fourth quarter lead simply evaporate. Manning improved the following week, throwing for 270 yards and two touchdowns against the Dallas Cowboys, but the Giants lost 23–20. Finally regaining momentum, Manning threw three touchdowns in a win on the road against the Carolina Panthers, but then he stumbled badly in the final three games. He threw two interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles and tallied only 73 passing yards in a game against the New Orleans Saints. Although the Giants battled back to 8–8 the following week on the road against the Washington Redskins, Manning completed only 12 of 26 passes for 101 yards and one touchdown. The Giants qualified for the postseason as the #6-seed and met the Philadelphia Eagles. Although he did significantly better in this game than the 2005 playoff game against the Carolina Panthers, completing 16 of 27 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns, the Giants lost in the Wild Card Round on a last-second field goal by the Eagles.

For the year, Manning threw for 3,244 yards, 24 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. He completed 57.7 percent of his passes, a five-point improvement from 2005, but he again struggled badly in the second half of the season. Manning finished the season with a quarterback efficiency rating of 77.0 (18th in the league) with 6.2 yards per attempt.

===2007 season: Super Bowl champions===
Manning trained in the Meadowlands with offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride and new quarterbacks coach Chris Palmer prior to the 2007 regular season. For the first time ever, Plaxico Burress and Jeremy Shockey practiced in the off-season with Manning to perfect their timing and chemistry rather than training alone in Miami as they did in previous years.

====2007 regular season====
Manning opened the 2007 season with an outstanding personal performance against the Dallas Cowboys, completing 28 of 41 passing attempts for 312 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception in New York&#x27;s 45–35 loss. However, he suffered a shoulder sprain and was removed from the game late in the second half. Although he did play against the Green Bay Packers in Week 2 while throwing for 211 yards with one touchdown, the Giants defense performed poorly again and the team dropped to 0–2 with Green Bay winning, 35–13. In week three, Manning got a come-from-behind victory as the Giants defense improved, pitching a shutout in the second half and stopping the Washington Redskins on a fourth and goal situation, winning the game 24–17. The Giants defense then shut down the Philadelphia Eagles with an NFL record-tying 12 sacks, holding the Eagles offense to one field goal. The Giants won with a score of 16–3. The following week, Manning overcame a dismal first half to throw for two second-half scores in a 35–24 win over their in-city rivals, the New York Jets.

Following two straight home victories, Manning and the Giants obtained their fourth consecutive victory with a 31–10 defeat of the Atlanta Falcons in the Georgia Dome on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Manning performed well, completing 27 of 39 passes for 303 yards along with a pair of touchdowns while giving away two interceptions. Behind a dominant defensive effort, the Giants improved to 5–2 the next week with a 33–15 win over the San Francisco 49ers. Manning played well again, throwing for two touchdowns in the effort. In week 8, the Giants played a road game against the Miami Dolphins on October 28, 2007, in London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium. Manning only threw for 59 yards in the rain and mud, but he scored the Giants&#x27; only touchdown on a 10-yard run. This touchdown was the first in an NFL regular season game that was played outside of North America. The Giants defeated the Dolphins, 13–10, bringing the Giants to a 6–2 record at the mid-way point of the 2007 season. After losing to their division rivals the Dallas Cowboys in Week 9, New York Giants co-owner John Mara publicly questioned Manning&#x27;s ability to lead the Giants in 2007, but more importantly, in the future:

After a week of criticism in the New York media and being outplayed by Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, Manning had a bounce-back victory against their conference Wild Card competitors the Detroit Lions. Manning threw for 283 yards and one touchdown but most importantly, no interceptions in a critical road game.

The following week in a 41–17 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, Manning threw four interceptions and had three of them returned for touchdowns. He continued to struggle until the last game of the season, against the 15–0 New England Patriots. With a playoff spot secured, the Giants could have rested their starters for the playoffs, but they instead chose to keep in the regulars and attempt to stop New England&#x27;s quest for an undefeated regular season. The Giants lost 38–35, with Manning completing 22 of 32 passes for 252 yards, with four touchdowns and one interception.

====2007 playoffs====

The Giants entered the playoffs as the #5-seed. On January 6, 2008, in the Wild Card Round, Manning went 20-of-27 for 185 yards playing on the road against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The underdog Giants won 24–14, and Manning had two touchdown passes.

On January 13, 2008, in the Divisional Round Manning led the Giants to an upset victory over the heavily favored Dallas Cowboys, the number one seed in the NFC. For the third straight game, Manning played well, completing 12 of 18 passes for 163 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. The Giants were the first team to beat an NFC number one seed in the Divisional Round since the start of the 12-team format in 1990. This victory secured an NFC Championship berth against the Green Bay Packers on January 20, 2008. In the NFC Championship, the Giants beat the Packers in overtime, with a score of 23–20 in one of the coldest postseason games in NFL history. The dramatic victory secured Manning and the Giants a trip to Super Bowl XLII. This was the first Super Bowl appearance for the New York Giants since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001.

====Super Bowl XLII====
In front of a record-setting American television audience and on the strength of a late fourth quarter drive led by Manning, the Giants beat the 12.5 point-favored, undefeated New England Patriots 17–14.

Trailing 14–10 with 2:42 remaining, Manning led the Giants 83 yards on a game-winning touchdown drive. On a crucial third-and-5 at the Giants&#x27; 44-yard line, Manning connected with David Tyree on a play in which he avoided several sacks and Tyree caught the ball off his helmet for a large gain. Four plays later, Plaxico Burress caught a 13-yard touchdown pass with just 35 seconds remaining for the winning margin. Manning became only the second quarterback in NFL history to throw two go-ahead fourth quarter touchdowns in a Super Bowl (Joe Montana being the first in Super Bowl XXIII in 1989). Manning also became the first quarterback to throw a last-minute, championship-winning touchdown in the NFL title game (including the pre-Super Bowl era) when a field goal would not at least tie the game.

Manning was named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XLII. He and his brother Peyton are the only brother combination to play at quarterback in the Super Bowl and the only set of brothers to win Super Bowl MVP, doing so in successive years.

For winning Super Bowl MVP, he was given his choice of any 2008 model Cadillac, and Manning chose an Escalade Hybrid. The Wednesday following the Super Bowl he appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.
===2008 season: NFC East champions===
Manning and the Giants opened the 2008 season with a win over their division rivals, the Washington Redskins, 16–7. Manning completed 19 passes of 35 for 216 yards, and had one rushing touchdown and one interception. Post-match, he said: &quot;It was a great opening to the season. There was a lot of emotion, a lot of excitement. You could feel it in the crowd.&quot; In the Giants&#x27; next game, against the St. Louis Rams, they won again, 41–13, behind a stellar Manning performance. Manning finished the game with 20 completions, 260 yards passing and threw three touchdowns to three different receivers. The victory also marked the team&#x27;s fourth straight victory over the Rams. The following week, Manning rallied the Giants to more fourth-quarter magic, overcoming a late deficit to throw the go-ahead touchdown pass to tight end Kevin Boss, and then in overtime, throwing a clutch 31-yard pass to Amani Toomer in the Giants&#x27; 26–23 win over Cincinnati Bengals. The fourth week of the season saw the Giants score on each of their first six possessions and dominate the Seattle Seahawks, 44–6. Manning threw for two touchdowns, completing 19 of 25 passes for 267 yards as the Giants totaled 523 yards on offense, their most since 2002.

Following a poor team performance in a 35–14 loss on the road against the Cleveland Browns, Manning and the Giants responded with a 29–17 win over the 49ers and battled to a hard earned 21–14 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Heinz Field. Manning completed 19 of 32 passes for 199 yards and one touchdown in the crucial win, which pushed the Giants to a 6–1 record. The following week, the Giants beat the Dallas Cowboys at home 35–14 to get to 7–1 at the midway point of the regular season. Manning threw three touchdowns in the game. New York improved to 8–1 with a 36–31 win on the road against the Philadelphia Eagles. Manning threw two touchdowns in the victory, but the crucial play occurred in the third quarter. With the Giants trailing by four, Manning appeared to make an illegal forward pass to tight end Boss. After review, it was determined that the pass was legal. The Giants scored a touchdown two plays later. Week nine pitted the Giants in a battle with the visiting Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens had come into the game with the league&#x27;s third-ranked defense; nevertheless, Manning led the Giants to a decisive 30–10 victory, improving to 9–1, which included a 200-yard rushing effort by running backs Brandon Jacobs, Derrick Ward and Ahmad Bradshaw. Two weeks later, the Giants faced the Redskins at Washington in their second encounter in the season. Manning threw his first 300-yard game of the season going 21-of-34 with an interception and a 40-yard touchdown pass to Toomer. The Giants beat the Redskins 23–7. In November, Manning was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month. For the month, Manning threw for 1,036 yards and ten touchdowns, and compiled a 94.9 passer rating while leading the Giants to a perfect 5–0 record.

Manning was named to his first Pro Bowl on December 16, making him the first Giants quarterback to earn the honor since Phil Simms in 1993. In week 15, Manning and the Giants visited Texas Stadium, where Tony Romo battled through a lower back contusion and connected with nine different receivers, finishing 20-of-30 for 244 yards and two touchdowns leading the Dallas Cowboys to a 20–8 victory. In week 16 against the Carolina Panthers with NFC homefield advantage on the line, Manning had a passing day of 17 of 27 for 181 yards and no interceptions. Manning led the Giants back from deficits of 21–10 and 28–20 to tie the game with just over three minutes left, including a bullet pass to Domenik Hixon for a key two-point conversion to tie the game at 28. The game was played in freezing conditions.

After becoming the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a 12–4 record, the Giants had a first playoff round bye week and homefield advantage through the rest of the playoffs. In the Divisional Round, they faced their archrival Philadelphia Eagles at Giants Stadium with its signature windy conditions. Philadelphia went on to win the game 23–11. Manning completed 15 out of 29 passes for 169 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions.

===2009 season===
On August 5, 2009, he signed a six-year US$97.5million contract extension.

Manning and the Giants started the 2009 season with a 3–0 record. In Week 4, the Giants played the Kansas City Chiefs. Manning was playing well up until the start of the fourth quarter when on a play-action fake, he injured his heel while passing downfield to Steve Smith. He stayed in for the next play completing a 54-yard touchdown to Hakeem Nicks. It was discovered that Manning had plantar fasciitis (inflammation of connective tissue within the soles of the feet) and there was speculation he would not play against the Oakland Raiders in Week 5. However, in Week 5, Manning played well, completing eight of ten passes for 173 yards and two touchdowns with the Giants winning 44–7. This was the first time in his career that Manning had a posted a perfect passer rating.

After this five-game winning streak, the Giants fell to a four-game losing streak, losing to the New Orleans Saints, the Arizona Cardinals, the Philadelphia Eagles and the San Diego Chargers, before winning again after a bye week on Week 11 when they played the Atlanta Falcons, winning 34–31 in overtime. Against the Falcons, Manning posted a career-high 384 passing yards with three touchdowns and one interception.

On Thanksgiving, the Giants traveled to Denver to play the Denver Broncos where they lost 26–6. Manning completed 24 of 40 passes for 230 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. In Week 14, they played their divisional rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles, and lost 45–38, where it was a close game from the start. Manning passed for a career-high 391 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions but was not able to win the game. Next week, on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, Manning and the Giants dominated the Washington Redskins, winning the game 45–12.

The next week, in the final game in Giants Stadium, Manning and the Giants lost 41–9 against the Carolina Panthers. The Giants did not fare better the next week on the road against the Minnesota Vikings in the final regular season game, losing 44–7 while down 38 points in the fourth quarter. After the games, Manning apologized to the fans for the team&#x27;s performance. The Giants finished the 2009 season with an 8–8 record and missed the playoffs.

Manning ended the 2009 season with career highs including 4,021 passing yards, 27 touchdowns, a 62.3 completion percentage rating, and a passer rating of 93.1.

===2010 season===
On August 16 during a preseason game against the New York Jets, Manning was hit by Brandon Jacobs, then by Calvin Pace, which knocked off his helmet, then went face first into Jim Leonhard&#x27;s face mask. As a result, Manning had a large gash that needed 12 stitches, and he left the game.

Manning and the Giants started the 2010 season with a 1–2 start followed by a five-game winning streak. In Week 15, he had 289 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in the 38–31 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. In Week 16, Manning connected on with Mario Manningham on a then-career-high 85-yard receiving touchdown in a 45–17 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The mark was broken the next week when Manning completed a 92-yard passing touchdown to Manningham in the 17–14 victory over the Washington Redskins. The Giants ended the 2010 NFL season with a 10–6 record. Manning led the Giants to a 17–14 win in the last game of the season against the Redskins, however, because of the Packers&#x27; 10–3 win over the Chicago Bears, the Giants did not make the playoffs. He ended the season with 4,002 yards, a career-high 31 touchdowns, but also a career-high 25 interceptions, which marked the most by a quarterback in the 2010 season, and a 62.5 completion percentage.

===2011 season: Second Super Bowl championship===
In August 2011, Manning generated mild controversy in the sports media during a radio interview on &quot;The Michael Kay Show&quot;. When asked by host Michael Kay whether he was an elite &quot;Top 10, Top 5&quot; quarterback in the same class as Tom Brady, he responded:

Manning received criticism for the quote for trying to inflate his own status and skills, with critics pointing out his past inconsistent stats, including his 25 interceptions in the previous season, as evidence contradicting his claims. However, Manning also received support for his comments from Giants coach Tom Coughlin, and teammates such as wide receiver Hakeem Nicks. Later in the season, Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Rob Ryan commented on the quote, agreeing with Manning that he was an elite quarterback &quot;for sure.&quot;

====2011 regular season====
The Giants opened the 2011 season with a slow start, losing to the rival Washington Redskins 28–14– in an emotional game for both fanbases on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Manning completed 18 of 32 passes for 268 yards but threw a costly interception in the third quarter to linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, who returned it for a touchdown and swung the momentum of the game. However, the Giants recovered and won their next three games, including over the arch-rival Philadelphia Eagles, where he had 254 passing yards and four touchdowns in the 29–16 victory to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. During this streak, Manning improved, throwing for 266 yards per game with eight total touchdowns and one interception.

After a 6–2 start, including a 24–20 last-minute comeback by Manning over the New England Patriots that evoked comparisons to Super Bowl XLII, the Giants entered a tough stretch of their schedule, facing off against the San Francisco 49ers, the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers, the respective eventual NFC West, South and North champions. The Giants lost all three games as well as falling to the Philadelphia Eagles at home, leading them into a four-game skid and once again putting their postseason hopes in jeopardy. However, unlike the previous three seasons, the Giants finished strong, winning three of their last four games. This included a key win over their crosstown rival New York Jets, where Manning tied an NFL record by completing a 99-yard touchdown pass to Victor Cruz, as well as a sweep of their fellow division rival Dallas Cowboys. In the final regular-season game against the Dallas Cowboys, Manning threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns, giving the Giants the win, the NFC East title, and a playoff berth for the first time in three years. He earned a Pro Bowl nomination for his performance in the 2011 season. He threw for at least 400 yards in three separate games, setting a new franchise record.

====2011 playoffs====
The Giants entered the 2011 postseason as underdogs, with the worst record of any NFC playoff team. However, Manning and his team would once again demonstrate their endurance and durability late in the year. The Giants first easily routed the Atlanta Falcons 24–2 in the Wild Card Round and then stunned the defending Super Bowl champions and top-seeded Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round to advance to the NFC Championship Game. In the win, Manning completed 21 out of 33 attempts and threw three touchdowns and one interception. The following week, the Giants avenged their regular season loss to the San Francisco 49ers with a dramatic 20–17 overtime win in the NFC Championship Game. In the game, Manning set franchise playoff records with 32 completions on 52 attempts, good enough for 316 yards and two touchdowns despite being sacked a franchise-record-tying six times. This victory secured Manning and the Giants a second trip in five years to the Super Bowl, setting up a highly anticipated Super Bowl XLII rematch against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. The Giants also made history as the first Super Bowl team ever outscored in the regular season (394 points scored, 400 points allowed).

====Super Bowl XLVI====

In the most-watched program in the history of United States television, Manning once again led the Giants to an upset victory over the -point-favored Patriots 21–17, his second Super Bowl win and the fourth overall for the franchise.

While trailing the Patriots 15–17 in the final minutes, Manning led the Giants 88 yards down the field to a touchdown that many observers described as &quot;accidental&quot;. With just over a minute of time left in the game, the Giants called a running play and Manning handed off the ball to Ahmad Bradshaw with the hopes of stopping short of the goal line and forcing the Patriots to use their final time out, thus allowing the Giants to run out the clock. The Patriots, in turn, did not attempt to tackle Bradshaw in his run, and he then fell over the goal line despite making an attempt to stop. However, the remaining time was not enough for Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to lead a comeback and the Giants held onto the lead to win. Manning was again named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XLVI, becoming the third quarterback in a row to win the award. The Giants also became the first team ever with fewer than ten wins in a 16-game regular season to win the Super Bowl. Manning also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for 4,900+ yards and win a Super Bowl in the same season. The Giants were the first team with a running game ranked last (32nd) and a defense ranked as low as 27th to win a Super Bowl.

For winning the Super Bowl, Manning and the Giants received a victory parade in Manhattan and were honored with symbolic keys to the city by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.

===2012 season===
The Giants endured a disappointing season following their Super Bowl run in 2011. Manning led the Giants to a 6–2 record to begin their season, including a career-best 510 passing yards to go along with three passing touchdowns and three interceptions in a Week 2 41–34 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He finished second only to Phil Simms&#x27;s game with 513 passing yards in 1985 for the franchise record. However, Manning averaged an anemic 204 yards per game and 74.3 passer rating from Week 8 to Week 16, including his lowest rating in five years (38.9) in a 34–0 loss to the Atlanta Falcons in Week 15. He ended the 2012 season on a high note, throwing a career-high five touchdown passes while completing 13 of 21 pass attempts and passing for 208 yards with no interceptions, in a 42–7 Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles. He finished the season with 26 touchdown passes, 15 interceptions and 3,948 passing yards. As was typical for this phase of his career (2012–2016), Manning was exceptionally well-protected by his offensive line; he was sacked just 19 times for a league-lowest 3.4% of passing plays. Although the Giants did not qualify for the playoffs with a 9–7 season, Manning was selected to his third Pro Bowl as a second alternate. He was ranked 43rd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.

===2013 season===

Manning started the 2013 season off with 450 passing yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions in a 36–31 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Manning set a franchise record for most passing yards in a season opener, breaking Phil Simms&#x27;s mark of 409 passing yards in the 1984 regular season opener. The loss was a sign of things to come as the Giants started the season with a 0–6 record, their worst regular season start since 1976. He threw 12 interceptions in his first five games. Manning fell to 0–3 against his older brother, Peyton in Week 2&#x27;s 41–23 loss to the Denver Broncos. He was 28 of 39 for 362 yards, but was intercepted four times. Manning&#x27;s four interceptions tied his career high and was the fourth time he threw four interceptions in a game. The game between Peyton and Eli was the final professional meeting of the two brothers. In Week 15, Manning threw for 156 yards and a career-high five interceptions in a 23–0 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Manning ended the season with a career-high 27 interceptions, which were the most in one season by a quarterback since Brett Favre had 29 in 2005. The Giants finished the season 7–9, their first losing record since Manning&#x27;s rookie year in 2004.

Manning passed Phil Simms to become the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in yards passing. Simms, who played 14 seasons with the Giants, finished his career with 33,462 yards in the air.

===2014 season===

After an 0–2 start, the Giants won three straight games but subsequently lost their next seven games including a 16–10 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in a game where Manning threw five interceptions, which tied his career high. The Giants won three of their last four games to end the season with a 6–10 record. Among Manning&#x27;s highlights from the losing season was a Week 17 game where he had 429 passing yards, one touchdown and one interception in a 34–26 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Manning finished the season with 30 touchdown passes, 14 interceptions and 4,410 passing yards.

===2015 season===

A few days before the Giants&#x27; regular season opener against the Dallas Cowboys, Manning signed a four-year, US$84million extension with the Giants. In Week 5, he had a franchise-record 41 completions for 441 passing yards, three touchdowns and one interception, in a 30–27 victory over the San Francisco 49ers to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Through six games, he led the Giants to a 3–3 record and a tie for first place in the NFC East. In Week 8, Manning threw a career-high six touchdowns and 350 yards, but the Giants lost to the New Orleans Saints, 52–49. He became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for six touchdowns and no interceptions in a game and lose. In Week 10, in a narrow 27–26 loss to the undefeated New England Patriots, Manning passed for 361 yards and two touchdowns, one of which was an 87-yard strike to Odell Beckham Jr. in the first quarter. In Week 14, in a 31–24 victory over the Miami Dolphins, he was 27-of-31 for 337 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. After starting the season 5–5, Giants fell to 1–5 the rest of the way to finish 6–10 for the second straight season. Manning&#x27;s longtime coach in Tom Coughlin stepped down at the end of the season.

Manning finished the 2015 season with career highs in touchdown passes (35), completions (387), attempts (618) and passer rating (93.6). His 35 touchdowns were one shy of tying Y. A. Tittle for most in a single season in franchise history and ranked tied for second among quarterbacks that year. Manning also threw 4,432 yards in 2015, second most in his career. On January 22, 2016, Manning was selected to his fourth career Pro Bowl, replacing Ben Roethlisberger. Manning&#x27;s fourth Pro Bowl berth ties Fran Tarkenton for most Pro Bowl selections by a New York Giants quarterback in franchise history. He was ranked 47th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.

===2016 season: Return to the playoffs===
Manning had a new head coach in Ben McAdoo for the 2016 season. Manning and the Giants started the 2016 season with a 2–3 record over the first five games. In the next game, a 27–23 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, Manning threw for three touchdowns, reaching a career total of 302 touchdown passes and passing John Elway for seventh all time.

Coming off a bye week and on a two-game winning streak, beating the Ravens and the Los Angeles Rams, Manning threw a season-high four touchdowns as the Giants would halt a last-second game-winning drive by the Philadelphia Eagles to win 28–23. In a Week 16 loss against the Eagles on December 22, Manning set a franchise record with 63 pass attempts in a single game, while throwing one touchdown and three interceptions, surpassing Peyton Manning&#x27;s record of 21 games with at least three interceptions with 22. Despite the loss, though, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost to the New Orleans Saints later that week 31–24, giving the Giants their first playoff berth since the 2011 season, when the team last won the Super Bowl.

By defeating the rival Washington Redskins in the final week of the NFL season on New Year&#x27;s Day and, therefore, knocking the Redskins out of playoff contention and bringing their season record to 11–5 (their first winning season since 2012), Manning and the Giants faced the Green Bay Packers in Lambeau Field in the Wild Card Round of the NFL playoffs, as Manning completed 23 of 44 of his passes for 299 yards, while throwing for a touchdown. Manning was back to his playoff self in the game, but was let down by numerous drops by Odell Beckham Jr., and other star playmakers. The Packers would eventually rout the Giants 38–13, ending the Giants&#x27; season. Manning finished the season recording 4,027 passing, 26 touchdowns and 16 interceptions, with an 86.0 passer rating.

On February 4, 2017, Manning and Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald both won the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, making it the first time since the 2006 season that two players were co-winners of this award (Drew Brees and LaDainian Tomlinson).

===2017 season===

Manning and the Giants started the 2017 season with five consecutive losses. The Giants broke their losing streak with a 23–10 victory over the Denver Broncos in Week 6. The success was short-lived as the Giants lost the next game to the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 24–7 to set off a three-game losing streak. During Week 9 against the Los Angeles Rams, he became the seventh quarterback to reach 50,000 passing yards. On November 28, after a 2–9 start to the season, it was announced that Manning would be benched and replaced by Geno Smith in Week 13 against the Oakland Raiders, ending Manning&#x27;s streak of 210 consecutive regular-season games started. The streak was second all-time for quarterbacks behind Brett Favre&#x27;s 297. Head coach Ben McAdoo gave Manning the option of starting to keep the streak going but Manning declined, stating that &quot;My feeling is that if you are going to play the other guys, play them. Starting just to keep the streak going and knowing you won&#x27;t finish the game and have a chance to win it is pointless to me, and it tarnishes the streak.&quot; The move was met with backlash from former Giants players and coaches. On December 5, two days after the Week 13 game, Manning was renamed the starter by interim head coach Steve Spagnuolo, after McAdoo was fired as head coach. During Week 15 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Manning finished with 434 passing yards, three touchdowns and an interception. The Giants lost 34–29, allowing the Eagles to clinch a first-round bye. On December 24, against the Arizona Cardinals, Manning passed John Elway to take sole possession of sixth place on the NFL&#x27;s all-time passing yard list. Manning started the regular-season finale against the Washington Redskins. In the 18–10 victory, he had 132 passing yards, one touchdown and one interception, as the Giants ended their disappointing season with a 3–13 record.

===2018 season===
Following speculation that Manning would be released, new Giants head coach Pat Shurmur put these rumors aside by saying &quot;I think what&#x27;s important is we have a guy here who has helped this organization win Super Bowls. He&#x27;s an outstanding player and I&#x27;m really looking forward to working with him.&quot;

After losses to the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys to the start the season, Manning and the Giants defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 27–22. Manning was efficient, going 25-of-29 for 297 passing yards and two touchdowns. The Giants lost the next five games, with Manning leading the leagues in sacks for most of that stretch despite an improved running game from rookie Saquon Barkley. Manning had 399 passing yards against the Atlanta Falcons, the fourth of these losses, but was sacked seven times and threw two interceptions in the following game against the Washington Redskins. Manning rebounded with three touchdowns and no interceptions in the following week&#x27;s 27–23 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, and 17 completions on 18 attempts for two touchdowns in a 38–35 win the following week over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Giants went 4–4 over the last eight games of the season to finish 5–11 and last in the NFC East. Manning passed for 4,299 yards, 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in the 2018 season.

===2019 season: Final year===
The 2019 season was Manning&#x27;s last remaining year on his contract. While the Giants had the option to release Manning in the offseason and save $17 million in both cash and cap space, the team opted to keep him on their roster. However, neither side held any discussions for a contract extension, causing doubt for Manning&#x27;s future as the Giants&#x27; franchise quarterback beyond the upcoming season. The team selected quarterback Daniel Jones in the first round of that year&#x27;s draft, which many saw as the Giants selecting Manning&#x27;s successor while further cementing his own lame-duck status in the position. Manning was informed of the Giants&#x27; decision during their draft selection. Despite the pick, general manager Dave Gettleman said &quot;the goal is for Eli to be our quarterback&quot;, while head coach Shurmur told Manning &quot;it&#x27;s your job to win games and keep [Jones] off the field&quot;.

Being on the Giants&#x27; roster meant that it would be Manning&#x27;s 16th season with the team, marking a franchise record for the longest tenure for any player in its 94-year history. Manning started the Giants&#x27; first two games of the season, losses to the Dallas Cowboys and the Buffalo Bills. On September 17, 2019, the Giants announced that Manning would not start the team&#x27;s Week 3 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, instead opting for Jones. This was thought to be the end of Manning&#x27;s time as the Giants&#x27; starting quarterback.

Due to an ankle injury suffered by Jones during Week 13 against the Green Bay Packers, Manning returned to the starting lineup the next week on December 9 against the Philadelphia Eagles. During the game, Manning threw for 203 yards and two touchdowns to rookie wide receiver Darius Slayton, but the game ended in a 23–17 overtime loss for the Giants. As the game was televised on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, it marked Manning&#x27;s final primetime appearance. In the following week&#x27;s game against the Miami Dolphins at home, Manning started again and threw for 283 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions, leading the team to a 36–20 win. As the game ended, Manning was taken off the field and received a standing ovation from fans who believed this was his final home game as the starting quarterback. Jones returned to action in Week 16 and finished out the season. Manning finished the year with 1,042 passing yards, six touchdowns and five interceptions in four games, as the Giants finished the season 4–12.

With his contract expiring at the end of the season, Manning was set to become a free agent for the first time in his career. When discussing his future plans, Manning stated that he did not wish to be a backup quarterback or pursue coaching opportunities with the team, as he felt he served both roles throughout the year and did not enjoy either one of them. Regardless, he said he would weigh his options for the upcoming season, stating &quot;I think I can still play&quot;. During a radio interview weeks later, team co-owner John Mara said that the Giants would welcome back Manning the next year as a backup quarterback or in a front-office role, but that newly hired head coach Joe Judge would need to give his approval to include Manning on the roster.

===Retirement and honors===
On January 22, 2020, Manning announced his retirement, with an official press conference scheduled for January 24. John Mara stated during the press conference that Manning would be inducted into the Giants Ring of Honor in 2020 and that Manning&#x27;s number 10 jersey would be retired.

Manning rejoined the Giants in 2021 in a business operations and fan engagement role, according to the team. His jersey retirement and induction into the Giants&#x27; Ring of Honor took place on September 26, 2021, at halftime of the Giants-Atlanta Falcons game at Metlife Stadium. In 2021, he was named to the Louisiana High School Sports Hall of Fame. He became eligible for Hall of Fame induction in 2025.

===&quot;The Manning Bowl&quot;===
Peyton and Eli Manning played against each other three times in the regular season during their professional careers. These encounters were colloquially dubbed &quot;The Manning Bowl&quot;, and Peyton&#x27;s teams, twice with the Colts and once with the Broncos, held a 3–0 record over Eli and the New York Giants. The first Manning Bowl was held on September 10, 2006, and Peyton&#x27;s Colts defeated Eli&#x27;s Giants by a score of 26–21. The second Manning Bowl was held on September 19, 2010, with Peyton and the Colts beating Eli&#x27;s Giants again by a score of 38–14. The third and final Manning Bowl was held on September 15, 2013, and Peyton and the Broncos beat Eli&#x27;s Giants 41–23. They faced each other in two Pro Bowls, in 2009 and 2013, both won by the NFC. However, they never faced each other in the playoffs as both always played in separate conferences and never made the Super Bowl at the same time.
==Post-playing career==
Eli and Peyton Manning joined ESPN as an NFL analyst for the 2021 season, calling nine games during the season on an alternate broadcast called the &quot;Manningcast&quot;. The show features segments with special guest stars from entertainment, politics, and sports while the Manning brothers watch the game. In addition, he currently hosts &quot;Eli&#x27;s Places&quot; for ESPN+, where he &quot;travel[s] to some of the most well-known and historic college football establishments and meet with giants in the sport to better understand what makes college football such a national sensation.&quot; He also received a nickname &quot;Human Carbon Monoxide&quot; or HCM from The Rock due to him not having a nickname unlike his brother Peyton &quot;The Sheriff&quot; Manning and Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson.

On May 5, 2012, Eli hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (season 37, episode 20), with musical guest Rihanna. His brother Peyton hosted the show five years earlier.

Eli began hosting The Eli Manning show in 2021 on the New York Giant&#x27;s YouTube channel. The show has featured interviews with celebrity guests such as Derek Jeter, Tracy Morgan, and Bill Murray.

In 2022, he went undercover as &quot;Chad Powers&quot; and participated in Penn State University football tryouts as a walk-on, which was filmed as part of an ESPN project.

==Personal life==

In 2007, he proposed to Abby McGrew of Nashville, Tennessee. McGrew worked in fashion in New York City, and has been with Manning since their days at the University of Mississippi. The couple wed in a private ceremony held in San José del Cabo, Mexico, on April 19, 2008. Manning and Abby have three daughters and a son. They reside in Summit, New Jersey.

Eli and Peyton Manning volunteered in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The Mannings assisted in the delivery of of water, Gatorade, baby formula, pumice, and pillows to the people of New Orleans. After touring the University of Mississippi Medical Center&#x27;s Blair E. Batson Hospital for Children, he undertook a five-year campaign in 2007 to raise US$2.5million for the construction of &quot;The Eli Manning Children&#x27;s Clinics&quot; at the children&#x27;s hospital. Manning said in 2007, &quot;I am humbled by the work they do and am honored to make this five-year commitment to help raise funds to build this state-of-the-art clinic that will serve Mississippi families for years to come.&quot; His father, Archie Manning, has also raised funds for Katrina relief efforts.

In 2009, Eli, Peyton, and Archie Manning co-authored a children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Family Huddle&quot;, which describes in simple text and pictures how the three Manning brothers played football as young boys (Scholastic Press; illustrations by Jim Madsen). In 2010, Manning helped raise funds for awareness of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in wake of the catastrophe.

Since 2008, Manning has been the host of Guiding Eyes for the Blind&#x27;s Golf Classic, the oldest and largest charity golf event in Westchester County, New York.

He is a former member of the President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.

In 2014, Manning was sued in New Jersey Superior Court by sports memorabilia collectors who alleged that Manning and others conspired to sell them fraudulent memorabilia. Pretrial discovery included emails from Manning to Giants equipment manager Joe Skiba requesting &quot;helmets that can pass as game-used.&quot; The suit alleged those helmets were eventually sold to the plaintiffs as game-used helmets. In May 2018, the suit was settled under confidential terms. According to lawyer and journalist Michael McCann, Manning settled before trial in order to avoid damage to his marketability as an endorser and discipline from the NFL.

In 2016, Manning was part of the 14th Annual BTIG Commissions for Charity Day, which was a fundraiser for hundreds of charities.

In August 2022, Manning joined the ownership group of the NWSL&#x27;s NJ/NY Gotham FC.

<text>The domain name net is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) used in the Domain Name System of the Internet. The name is derived from the word &quot;network&quot;, indicating it was originally intended for organizations involved in networking technologies, such as Internet service providers and other infrastructure companies. However, there are no official restrictions and the domain is now a general-purpose namespace. 

==History==
 is one of the original top-level domains (the other six being , , , , , and ) despite not being mentioned in RFC 920, having been created in January 1985.

Verisign, the operator of after acquiring Network Solutions, held an operations contract that expired on 30 June 2005. ICANN, the organization responsible for domain management, sought proposals from organizations to operate the domain upon expiration of the contract. Verisign regained the contract bid and secured its control over the registry for another six years.
On 30 June 2011, the contract with Verisign was automatically renewed for another six years. This is because of a resolution approved by the ICANN board, which states that renewal will be automatic as long as Verisign meets certain ICANN requirements. As of May 2022, Verisign continues to manage .net.

==Registration==
Registrations are processed via accredited registrars and internationalized domain names are also accepted.

The first created .net domain name is nordu.net. It was created on 1 January 1985 according to the public records, and NORDUnet has used this domain name since 1985.

Net extension is the most preferred gTLD just after .com.

Total registered domain names with net extension are 13.0 million as of Q2 2024.

As of 2024, it is the fourth most popular top-level domain, after , and . The .net domain rose from fifth to fourth place as a result of the .tk domain ceasing to accept registrations.

The character&#x27;s name is derived from a bland and fairly inoffensive food, milk toast, which, light and easy to digest, is an appropriate food for someone with a weak or &quot;nervous&quot; stomach.

== History ==
In 1912, Webster drew a daily panel for the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, under a variety of titles—&quot;Our Boyhood Ambitions&quot;, &quot;Life&#x27;s Darkest Moment&quot;, &quot;The Unseen Audience&quot;. In 1924, Webster moved to the &quot;New York World&quot; and soon after added &quot;The Timid Soul&quot; featuring the wimpy Caspar Milquetoast. Milquetoast developed out of the design of another character, Egbert Smear, or &quot;The Man in the Brown Derby&quot;. The character was said to have ushered in a new era of timidity in comics.

In 1927, Webster trained himself to draw left-handed in three months after a severe case of arthritis impaired the use of his right hand. In 1931, the &quot;World&quot; folded, and that same year, Simon &amp; Schuster published a collection of &quot;The Timid Soul&quot; reprints. Webster then went back to the &quot;Tribune&quot; (now known as the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;), where he launched a &quot;Timid Soul&quot; Sunday strip. He alternated his various features throughout the week: Caspar Milquetoast was seen on both Sunday and Monday. The character was featured in books, film, radio programs and vaudeville acts. Webster continued to produce this syndicated panel until his death in 1952, after which his assistant Herb Roth carried it on for another year.

In November 1945, Webster was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. The accompanying article said, &quot;millions of Americans know Caspar Milquetoast as well as they know Tom Sawyer and Andrew Jackson, better than they know George F. Babbitt, and any amount better than they know such world figures as Mr. Micawber and Don Quixote. They know him, in fact, almost as well as they know their own weaknesses.&quot;

== Adaptation ==
On June 22, 1949, the DuMont Television Network adapted &quot;The Timid Soul&quot; to television as the premiere presentation of its anthology series &quot;Program Playhouse&quot;. Caspar Milquetoast in that episode, now lost, was portrayed by Ernest Truex.

== Legacy ==
Because of the popularity of Webster&#x27;s character, the term &quot;milquetoast&quot; came into general usage in American English to mean &quot;weak and ineffectual&quot;. When the term is used to describe a person, it typically indicates someone of an unusually meek, bland, soft, or submissive nature, who is easily overlooked, written off, and who may also appear overly sensitive, timid, indecisive or cowardly. &quot;Milquetoast&quot; appears in most American English dictionaries, but is not in many other English dictionaries.

One journalist has suggested that Casper the Friendly Ghost, a cartoon character originating in the late 1930s, was a spoof named partially after Webster&#x27;s Milquetoast, although there has been no official confirmation of this relationship.

<text>Sylvain Julien Victor Arend (6 August 1902 – 18 February 1992) was a Belgian astronomer born in Robelmont, Luxembourg province, Belgium. His main interest was astrometry.

Together with Georges Roland, he discovered the bright comet C/1956 R1 (Arend-Roland). He also discovered, or co-discovered, the periodic comets 49P/Arend-Rigaux and 50P/Arend, Nova Scuti 1952, and a number of asteroids, including notably the Amor asteroid 1916 Boreas and the Trojan asteroid 1583 Antilochus. He also discovered 1652 Hergé which is named after Hergé, the creator of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The asteroid 1563 Noël is named after his son, Emanuel Arend.

In 1948, Arend started together with sixteen other people the skeptic organisation Comité Para. The outer main-belt asteroid 1502 Arenda was named in his honor.

<text>John Leslie Keeble (born 6 July 1959) is an English pop and rock drummer. He is best known for his membership of the 1980s new wave band Spandau Ballet.

==Early years==
Keeble was athletic as a child, playing both football and cricket. He bought his first drum kit at the age of 16 and started pursuing an interest in music in a Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s School band called The Cut with Gary Kemp, Tony Hadley and Steve Norman in 1976. The band soon recruited Kemp&#x27;s brother Martin on bass, which completed the line-up. The band was later named The Makers, The Gentry and then Spandau Ballet.

== Spandau Ballet ==
Spandau Ballet produced a number of international hits including &quot;True&quot;, &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Through the Barricades.&quot; In 1984 the band participated in the Band Aid charity project and Live Aid the following year. The band broke up in 1990, after their final studio album, &quot;Heart Like a Sky&quot;, failed to live up to the critical and commercial success of their earlier albums, such as &quot;True&quot; and &quot;Parade&quot;.

In 1999, John Keeble, along with fellow band members Tony Hadley and Steve Norman, attempted to sue former Spandau Ballet guitarist, Gary Kemp, for alleged unpaid royalties. They claimed that an agreement had existed between Kemp and the rest of the band, whereby Kemp, who was the main songwriter in the band, would pay his bandmates a share of the royalties earned. The claims were vigorously denied by Kemp, and Keeble, Hadley and Norman subsequently lost their court case. Although initially vowing to appeal against the verdict, they later decided against this.

Keeble, with Gary Kemp, was instrumental in setting up Spandau Ballet&#x27;s reunion in the 2000s. On 25 March 2009, he joined the rest of his original classic-line-up bandmates for a press conference at HMS Belfast, to announce that the band had reformed and would conduct a world tour starting in Dublin in October 2009.

== Other work ==
Keeble played drums for Fish, the former lead singer of Marillion, during his first-ever solo show in the Rex Cinema at Lockerbie on 21 March 1989. He performed on his single &quot;State of Mind&quot;, the third track on his debut solo album &quot;Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors&quot;.

He has also worked with 69 Daze, The Herbs, Pacific and Tim Deluxe.

After the original breakup of Spandau Ballet, Keeble played in the Tony Hadley solo band and was on tour throughout 2006. He has also formed his own rock band, I Play Rock, with Richie B and Chris Paulo Dale, in which he plays drums and provides vocals.

== Personal life ==
Keeble became friends with Fish when they met at Live Aid. Keeble married his wife Leaflyn in 1988 and Fish gave her away at the wedding. The couple have a daughter Jaime Rae Keeble (born 1990).

<text>Gary James Kemp (born 16 October 1959) is an English songwriter, musician and actor, best known as the lead guitarist, backing vocalist, and principal songwriter for the new wave band Spandau Ballet.

Kemp wrote the lyrics and music for all 23 of Spandau Ballet&#x27;s hit singles, including &quot;To Cut a Long Story Short&quot;, &quot;True&quot;, &quot;Gold&quot;, &quot;Chant No. 1 (I Don&#x27;t Need This Pressure On)&quot;, &quot;Through the Barricades&quot; and &quot;Only When You Leave&quot;. Spandau Ballet became one of the biggest British bands of the 1980s, generating over 25 million record sales worldwide. In 2012, Kemp was an Ivor Novello Award winner for Outstanding Song Collection. His brother Martin Kemp plays bass guitar in the band and is also an actor. Since 2018, Kemp has also toured the US and Europe with the psychedelic rock group Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets.

==Early life==
Gary James Kemp was on born 16 October 1959, to parents Eileen and Frank Kemp in St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, Smithfield, London, within the sound of St Mary-le-Bow&#x27;s bells and grew up in Islington, London, in a working-class family. He attended Rotherfield Junior School and Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s grammar school in Islington and later in the sixth form relocated to Potters Bar.

He was active in the Anna Scher Children&#x27;s Theatre drama club, along with his brother Martin. He acted in various Children&#x27;s Film Foundation television and film productions beginning with &quot;Junket 89&quot; in 1970, which starred Richard Wilson (later known for &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;). Kemp played the lead role in the 1972 film &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; alongside Roy Dotrice which was given a Royal premiere for the CFF&#x27;s 21st anniversary, attended by the Duchess of Kent. Gary was interviewed about his role for Film 72.

Kemp had a love for glam rock and also an interest in progressive rock. His first musical collaboration was with Anna Scher regulars Phil Daniels and Peter Hugo Daly. He performed with them on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;You Must Be Joking!&quot; in 1975. Aged 14, Kemp played guitar with Islington-based The Same Band and future Spandau Ballet session keyboard player Ian &#x27;Jess&#x27; Bailey.

The first band he formed with Alice Owen&#x27;s schoolmates Steve Norman, John Keeble and Tony Hadley was called Roots after Kemp and Norman saw the Sex Pistols perform at The Screen on the Green in August 1976. The band changed its name to The Cut then became power pop group The Makers, favourably reviewed by &quot;New Musical Express&quot; in Dec 1977. Martin Kemp joined as bass player when they became Gentry in July 1978 before transforming into Spandau Ballet and playing live for the first time at Blitz on 5 December 1979. The band&#x27;s early success was driven by London&#x27;s burgeoning nightclubbing scene in which Gary Kemp identified Spandau&#x27;s role: &quot;We are making the most contemporary statement in fashion and music.&quot;

==Spandau Ballet==

After recording Spandau Ballet&#x27;s final album &quot;Heart Like a Sky&quot;, in 1989, Kemp and his brother returned to acting. He earned criticism from his fellow band members Tony Hadley, Steve Norman and John Keeble, but received good reviews for his performance as Ronnie Kray in &quot;The Krays&quot; (1990). The success of this film was the death-knell for Spandau Ballet.

Spandau Ballet played the final live show of their 10th anniversary tour at the Edinburgh Playhouse on 6 March 1990. They would not perform live together again for 19 years.

In 1999, Hadley, Norman and Keeble attempted to sue Kemp for alleged unpaid royalties. They claimed that an agreement had existed between him and the rest of the band, whereby Kemp, who was the main songwriter in the band, would pay his bandmates a share of the royalties earned. The claims were vigorously denied by Kemp; Hadley, Norman and Keeble subsequently lost their court case. Although initially vowing to appeal the verdict, they later decided against this.

After two decades apart the band reformed in 2009 with an announcement on HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;, venue of one of their earliest secret gigs. Two world tours followed, including five nights at London O2 arena. Their story was documented by the critically acclaimed film &quot;Soul Boys of the Western World&quot; which premiered at SXSW in 2012 and was screened at film festivals all over the world including Cannes, Rome and NYC Doc.

On 6 June 2018, Spandau Ballet played their first show with new singer Ross William Wild at London&#x27;s Subterania after Tony Hadley announced on social media that he had left the band. Spandau Ballet subsequently played six European shows in Rome, Milan, Padua, Utrecht and Tilburg with the last of those in London at Eventim Apollo Hammersmith on 29 October 2018. In May 2019 Wild tweeted: &quot;I have formally quit the band Spandau Ballet.&quot;

== Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets ==
Kemp is a longtime fan of Pink Floyd, and in 2018 he was invited by the band&#x27;s drummer Nick Mason to contribute guitar and vocals to Mason&#x27;s psychedelic rock band Saucerful of Secrets, &quot;capturing the spirit&quot; of the early music of Pink Floyd. The band includes Guy Pratt on bass and vocals, Lee Harris on guitar and backing vocals, and Dom Beken on keyboards.

The band made their live debut in May 2018 at Dingwalls in London playing a selection of Pink Floyd material predating their 1973 album, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. This was followed by three shows at The Half Moon, Putney and a European tour the same year.

In 2019, an extended tour of the US and Canada was announced starting in Vancouver at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on 12 March. This was followed by five additional UK shows set to run from April to May and another European tour in July the same year. Another European tour, the Echoes tour, set to begin in April 2020 was postponed to April 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A second North American tour was postponed from January 2022 to September.

Kemp also appears on the band&#x27;s 2020 live album and film, &quot;Live at the Roundhouse&quot;.

== Other music projects ==
Kemp performed &quot;Through the Barricades&quot; solo in December 1985 at London&#x27;s Dominion Theatre for the Snowball Review, a fund raiser organised by Pete Townshend for a women&#x27;s domestic violence charity.

He released a solo album, &quot;Little Bruises&quot;, in 1995, on Sony Records produced by Bow Wow Wow member and Malcolm McLaren producer, Leigh Gorman. It was followed by a tour of the UK and Ireland.

Two of his songs appeared on the debut album by American soap star Jacob Young in 2001.

Other musical collaborations include writing music and additional lyrics with Guy Pratt for the musical production &quot;Bedbug&quot;, lyrics and book by Snoo Wilson, a reimagined adaptation of the Vladimir Mayakovsky play, as part of the Shell Connections Youth Drama in 2004 which was presented at the National Theatre and revived there in 2016. He has written another musical, &quot;A Terrible Beauty,&quot; also with Pratt and Oscar nominated book writer Shane Connaughton (My Left Foot) based on the life of W. B. Yeats and Maud Gonne.

He released a second solo studio album, &quot;INSOLO&quot;, in 2021 on Columbia Records produced and mixed by Gary Kemp and keyboards player Toby Chapman.

<doc id="618435" wikidata="Q1071659" url="?curid=618435" title="Subjectivism">
<text>Subjectivism is the doctrine that &quot;our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience&quot;, instead of shared or communal, and that there is no external or objective truth.

While Thomas Hobbes was an early proponent of subjectivism, the success of this position is historically attributed to Descartes and his methodic doubt. He used it as an epistemological tool to prove the opposite (an objective world of facts independent of one&#x27;s own knowledge, ergo the &quot;Father of Modern Philosophy&quot; inasmuch as his views underlie a scientific worldview). Subjectivism accords primacy to subjective experience as fundamental of all measure and law. In extreme forms like Solipsism, it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends solely on someone&#x27;s subjective awareness of it. One may consider the qualified empiricism of George Berkeley in this context, given his reliance on God as the prime mover of human perception.

== Metaphysical subjectivism ==
Subjectivism is a label used to denote the philosophical tenet that &quot;our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience.&quot; While Thomas Hobbes was an early proponent of subjectivism, the success of this position is historically attributed to Descartes and his methodic doubt. Subjectivism has historically been condemned by Christian theologians, which oppose to it the objective authority of the church, the Christian dogma, and the revealed truth of the Bible. Christian theologians, and Karl Barth in particular, have also condemned anthropocentrism as a form of subjectivism.

Metaphysical subjectivism is the theory that reality is what we perceive to be real, and that there is no underlying true reality that exists independently of perception. One can also hold that it is consciousness rather than perception that is reality (idealism). This is in contrast to metaphysical objectivism and philosophical realism, which assert that there is an underlying &#x27;objective&#x27; reality which is perceived in different ways.

This viewpoint should not be confused with the stance that &quot;all is illusion&quot; or that &quot;there is no such thing as reality.&quot; Metaphysical subjectivists hold that reality is real enough. They conceive, however, that the nature of reality as related to a given consciousness is dependent on that consciousness. This has its philosophical basis in the writings of Descartes (see &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot;), and forms a cornerstone of Søren Kierkegaard&#x27;s philosophy.

=== Modern versions ===
Recently, more modest versions of metaphysical subjectivism have been explored. For example, I might hold that it is a &quot;fact&quot; that chocolate is tasty, even though I recognize that it is not tasty to everyone. This would imply that there are facts that are &quot;subjective&quot;. (Analogously, one might hold that it is a fact that it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, even though this is not always the case, implying that some facts are &quot;temporary&quot;.) Giovanni Merlo has developed a specific version of metaphysical subjectivism, under which subjective facts always concern &quot;mental&quot; properties. With Giulia Pravato, he has argued that his version of subjectivism provides a natural way to be both a realist and a relativist about, for example, the proposition that chocolate is tasty—it is part of reality (a subjective fact) that chocolate is tasty, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s necessarily true from another&#x27;s point of view. Caspar Hare&#x27;s theory of egocentric presentism is another, closely related example.

=== Subjectivism and panpsychism ===
One possible extension of subjectivist thought is that conscious experience is available to all objectively perceivable substrates. Upon viewing images produced by a camera on the rocking side of an erupting volcano, one might suppose that their relative motion followed from a subjective conscious within the volcano. These properties might also be attributed to the camera or its various components as well.

In this way, though, subjectivism morphs into a related doctrine, panpsychism, the belief that every objective entity (or event) has an inward or subjective aspect.

== Ethical subjectivism ==

Ethical subjectivism is the meta-ethical belief that ethical sentences reduce to factual statements about the attitudes and/or conventions of individual people, or that any ethical sentence implies an attitude held by someone. As such, it is a form of
moral relativism in which the truth of moral claims is relative to the attitudes of individuals (as opposed to, for instance, communities). Consider the case this way — to a person imagining what it&#x27;s like to be a cat, catching and eating mice is perfectly natural and morally sound. To a person imagining they are a mouse, being hunted by cats is morally abhorrent. Though this is a loose metaphor, it serves to illustrate the view that each individual subject has their own understanding of right and wrong.

An ethical subjectivist might propose, for example, that what it means for something to be morally right is just for it to be approved of. (This can lead to the belief that different things are right according to each idiosyncratic moral outlook.) One implication of these beliefs is that, unlike the moral skeptic or the non-cognitivist, the subjectivist thinks that ethical sentences, while subjective, are nonetheless the kind of thing that can be true or false depending on situation.

== In probability ==
Broadly speaking, there are two views on Bayesian probability that interpret the probability concept in different ways. In probability, a subjectivist stand is the belief that probabilities are simply degrees-of-belief by rational agents in a certain proposition, and which have no objective reality in and of themselves. According to the subjectivist view, probability measures a &quot;personal belief&quot;. For this kind of subjectivist, a phrase having to do with probability simply asserts the degree to which the subjective actor believes their assertion is true or false. As a consequence, a subjectivist has no problem with differing people giving different probabilities to an uncertain proposition, and all being correct.

Many modern machine learning methods are based on objectivist Bayesian principles. According to the objectivist view, the rules of Bayesian statistics can be justified by requirements of rationality and consistency and interpreted as an extension of logic. In attempting to justify subjective probability, Bruno de Finetti created the notion of philosophical coherence. According to his theory, a probability assertion is akin to a bet, and a bet is coherent only if it does not expose the wagerer to loss if their opponent chooses wisely. To explain his meaning, de Finetti created a thought-experiment to illustrate the need for principles of coherency in making a probabilistic statement. In his scenario, when someone states their degree-of-belief in something, one places a small bet for or against that belief and specifies the odds, with the understanding that the &quot;other&quot; party to the bet may then decide which side of the bet to take. Thus, if Bob specifies 3-to-1 odds against a proposition A, his opponent Joe may then choose whether to require Bob to risk $1 in order to win $3 if proposition A is found to be true, or to require Bob to risk $3 in order to win $1 if the proposition A is not true. In this case, it is possible for Joe to win over Bob. According to de Finetti, then, this case is incoherent.

<text>The Second River, or Watsessing River, in the state of New Jersey in the United States, is the second main tributary of the Passaic River encountered while travelling upstream from its mouth at Newark Bay.

From its source in West Orange to the Passaic, it is approximately 5 mi (8 km) long.

From West Orange, the Second River passes generally easterly through the towns of Orange and East Orange, where it is joined by Wigwam, Parrow, and Nishuane Brooks, then turns slightly to the north (though still generally easterly), and enters the town of Bloomfield. Here, at Watsessing Park, it is joined by Toney&#x27;s Brook.

After leaving Bloomfield, it enters the town of Belleville (which was, early in its history, also named &quot;Second River&quot;), and turns slightly to the south (though still generally easterly). Soon into Belleville, it forms the border between Belleville and Newark. Finally, it joins the Passaic River, on its way to Newark Bay.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Second River supported a sizable industrial complex of mills and factories.

The Reformed Dutch Church of Second River is named after this river.

<doc id="618442" wikidata="Q383595" url="?curid=618442" title="Flamingo Road (TV series)">
<text>Flamingo Road is an American prime time television soap opera that aired on NBC. It premiered as a television film on May 12, 1980, and as a series on January 6, 1981, after a rebroadcast of the pilot on December 30, 1980. The show was based on a 1942 Robert Wilder novel of the same name and the 1949 movie scripted by Wilder and starring Joan Crawford.

The show was created by Lorimar Productions, who was producing CBS&#x27;s &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Knots Landing&quot; at the same time. Set in the present-day fictional town of Truro, Florida, &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; centered on the wealthy Weldon family, who made their fortune running the town paper mill.

==Television film (1980)==
The show&#x27;s pilot introduces the Weldon family who reside on the ritzy Flamingo Road in Truro, Florida. Claude Weldon (Kevin McCarthy) is the patriarch, who owns the town&#x27;s paper mill, who is turning the family business over to his son, Skipper (Woody Brown). Eudora (Barbara Rush) is his neglected wife, Constance Weldon (Morgan Fairchild) is his spoiled adopted daughter. Constance is engaged to Deputy Fielding &quot;Field&quot; Carlyle, whose every move is dominated by the corrupt Sheriff Titus Semple (Howard Duff), who virtually controls the small town.

Field develops a relationship with Lane Ballou (Cristina Raines), a singer with Coyne&#x27;s Traveling Circus, who is left behind when the circus is run out of town. Titus is dismayed by this, as he wants Field to someday become a Senator and marry into the Weldon family. After Lane takes a job at the Eagle Cafe, alongside Annabelle Troy (Dianne Kay), Skipper&#x27;s girlfriend, Titus plots her demise, and at the end of the first hour, Lane is falsely picked up for solicitation. After completing her sentence, Lane defiantly returns to town, taking a job with Lute-Mae Sanders (Stella Stevens), the local bordello owner and Constance&#x27;s secret mother with Claude, and forming a connection with Sam Curtis (John Beck), a construction magnate. Field and Constance eventually get married with much of the town in attendance, and Eudora finds comfort in Elmo Tyson (Mason Adams), publisher of the town&#x27;s newspaper. Claude reveals his financial issues to Titus, who agrees to help him in an insurance fraud scheme. The mill is set aflame, with Annabelle (who is revealed to be Titus&#x27; daughter and planning on meeting Skipper there) accidentally perishing in the fire.

==Weekly series (1981–1982)==
===Synopsis===
The series picks up where the pilot left off, with Sheriff Titus double-crossing a drug dealing couple, who take revenge by abducting newlyweds Field and Constance, who are honeymooning in the Bahamas. They are eventually saved by Sam Curtis, however the drama continues when they return to Truro. Field, who is campaigning for senator, invites Lane to a trip to Tallahassee, where they continue their affair. Constance gets wind of Field&#x27;s deception and begins conspiring with Titus to get Lane sent out of town. Meanwhile, Annabelle&#x27;s mother, Mary Troy (Alice Hirson), comes to town to investigate her daughter&#x27;s violent death, and the possibility that the Weldon fire was arson. It is revealed that Annabelle was the product of rape, when Sheriff Titus forced himself on Mary.

As the election nears, Field falls off the wagon and turns up drunk at an important political rally. To save his campaign, Constance blabs unconfirmed information about his opponent, and in the end, Field wins the election and is made a Senator of Florida. Their marriage eventually falls apart. Skipper prepares to leave town to accept a job in New Orleans, but decides to stay after Claude is seriously injured in an accident at the mill. He then starts dating Christie Kovacs (Denise Galik), a manipulative girl living with her overbearing sister Alice (Marcia Rodd), a mill employee who is secretly in love with Claude. Christie has an affair with Field, and the two end up in a car accident together, which threatens to ruin Field&#x27;s political career. Both sisters eventually leave town.

Meanwhile, Lane is tormented by an old acquaintance, for having information about a murder that occurred several years earlier. After an old friend from the circus, Beth McDonald (Sandra Kerns), turns up dead, Lane is kidnapped by the killer Slade (Michael Baseleon). Constance agrees to a divorce with Field, and has a tryst with Sam in revenge. The first season ends with most of the cast trapped in a hurricane and taking refuge at Lute-Mae&#x27;s, where Lane&#x27;s kidnappers are arrested. After Field comforts Lane, Constance confronts him, claiming the divorce papers she had drawn were fakes and that she and Field were still married. In a rage, Field and Constance get into an altercation, with Constance falling from the second-story staircase at Lute-Mae&#x27;s place.

In season two, Constance survives her fall, but is paralyzed indefinitely from the waist down as a result. This becomes a political scandal for Field, but Constance agrees to not to press charges if he continues their sham of a marriage. Eudora discovers that Lute-Mae and Claude are Constance&#x27;s biological parents. Lute-Mae faces her own problems when she is raped by a delivery boy, who is the son of an influential Truro family. Titus refuses to conduct a proper investigation, however Lute-Mae works with Late to get justice.

Field campaigns aggressively to fix a Cuban barrio in town, before discovering Claude is the owner (under Eudora&#x27;s name). Ruthless tycoon Michael Tyrone (David Selby) comes to town, and gets into a bidding war with Sam for a piece of waterfront property, and with Claude and Eudora for the barrio. Eudora refuses to sell, and develops an addiction to painkillers. Constance eventually regains the use of her legs, but pretends to be paralyzed to keep Field around. The truth eventually comes out when Eudora&#x27;s addiction worsens, and Eudora is sent to live in a mental sanitarium until she recovers. While she is away, Claude forges her signature to sign the barrio over to Tyrone, who plans on building a casino resort on the property and has Titus evict the Cubans who live there. They include Julio Sanchez (Fernando Allende), who becomes Constance&#x27;s lover, and his sister Alicia (Gina Gallego), who falls in love with Skipper. When Eudora gets wind of her name being forged, Tyrone loses the barrio, in revenge, he buys the local blank and forecloses on Claude&#x27;s paper mill, making Field the new owner. Sam and Lane fall in love and get married. Elmo&#x27;s feud with Titus heats up, with Titus setting off an explosion at the newspaper which leaves Skipper sightless. Alicia stays by him, and they eventually elope and move into the Weldon mansion together.

Field starts dating a reporter, Sandy Swanson (Cynthia Sikes), who is secretly Michael Tyrone&#x27;s sister. Tyrone&#x27;s true intentions are revealed, he has come to Truro in revenge after Field&#x27;s father, Judge Andrew Carlyle, convicted his father for murder and gave him the death penalty. Tyronne firmly believed that his father was innocent, despite the endless evidence that pointed to his guilt, and wanted everyone connected to Judge Carlyle and Titus, who was still sheriff at the time, to suffer. He uses voodoo as his method of destruction, crashing Sam and Field&#x27;s plane in the Everglades, and then killing his own sister for sleeping with Field by having her car go off a cliff.

After sleeping with nearly everyone else on the cast, Tyrone and Constance start an affair. He then leaves her for Lute-Mae, after finding out she&#x27;s Constance&#x27;s mother. Lane and Sam announce that they are expecting a baby. After his season-long campaign to make gambling legal in Florida fails, Tyrone reveals to Constance her true parentage. Soon after, he is shot and presumably killed. In the series finale, several cast members are suspected of the crime before Lute-Mae is arrested as the prime suspect. However, the show ends on a cliffhanger, with Tyrone showing up alive at a reclusive mountaintop monastery.

===Reception===
Though the show was initially popular, it soon succumbed to being scheduled against ABC&#x27;s mystery romance &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;. NBC pulled the plug on the show in Spring 1982 with its cliffhanger left unresolved, though reruns aired in the timeslot until mid summer of that year. As the 1981–82 season ranked No. 68 out of 105 shows, NBC executives planned a half-hour daytime version of the series to debut in September 1982, but this never came to pass despite the fact a bible for a third season had been drafted by producer Jeff Freilich.

Several of its stars later became better known for other soap opera appearances, with Morgan Fairchild starring on the short-lived soap &quot;Paper Dolls&quot; before reuniting with David Selby on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and later appearing on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The City&quot;. John Beck went onto appear on &quot;Dallas&quot;, while Howard Duff had recurring roles on both &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. The character of Constance Weldon ranked at #16 on E!&#x27;s list of &quot;The 50 Most Wicked Women in Primetime&quot;.

<doc id="618454" wikidata="Q71696" url="?curid=618454" title="Heinrich Blücher">
<text>Heinrich Friedrich Ernst Blücher (29 January 1899 – 31 October 1970) was a German poet and philosopher. He was the second husband of Hannah Arendt whom he had first met in Paris in 1936. During his life in America, Blücher traveled in popular academic circles and appears prominently in the lives of various New York intellectuals.

==Biography==
Blücher was born in Berlin among the poor working class of the city. He was a member of the Communist Party of Germany until 1928, but soon rejected Stalinism and left the party in protest of its Stalinist policies. He then became a member of a small anti-Stalinist group called the Communist Party Opposition. Dwight Macdonald would later describe Blücher&#x27;s political identity as a &quot;true, hopeless anarchist.&quot; He is remembered as a philosopher, yet he &quot;was an autodidact who had gone to night school but never graduated, a bohemian who until 1933 had worked in German cabarets.&quot;

As a Communist, Blücher had to flee Germany following the rise of National Socialism. He escaped without the necessary travel documents across the Czech border, the same route taken by his wife. During his time in France he became close friends with Walter Benjamin, through whom he met Arendt. He married Hannah Arendt in France, and they emigrated to New York City in 1941.

Heinrich Blücher began teaching philosophy at Bard College in 1952, despite having no post-secondary education, continuing for seventeen years, as well as at the New School for Social Research. While there he continued to hold radical anti-establishment views, stating in a lecture that &quot;The C.I.A. has infiltrated the National Student Organization. That means we are being bribed, we are being used, and we are no longer academicians any more.&quot; Later in the same lecture he insisted, that if &quot;what the government says must be right, it must be spread, and no dissent shall be possible. If they call that consensus, then to hell with it.&quot; He argued that America was now &quot;doing what the others (the totalitarians, the Russians) did all along.&quot; He died of a heart attack at the age of 71, in the apartment he shared with Arendt at 370 Riverside Drive, New York City. His wife Hannah Arendt was later buried alongside him at Bard College Cemetery.

==Marriage to Hannah Arendt==

Arendt and Blücher met in 1936, in a café along the rue Soufflot frequented by their friend Walter Benjamin and other German émigrés. Arendt was twenty-nine, Blücher thirty-seven. Both were fugitives from the Nazis. Blücher was considered a communist militant, thus he lacked the requisite &quot;permis de séjour&quot; to work and had to move frequently from hotel to hotel. Both were still formally married, but separated from their spouses. Due to the pressures of lacking citizenship and their marital status, Blücher would not marry Arendt until 1940, despite accounts reporting that they fell in love immediately. The marriage would last until his death; however, it would change in relation and normalcy over time. By 1952, the marriage was polyamorous. In a letter to Blücher, Arendt expressed joy at this, writing, &quot;Yes, love, our hearts have really grown toward each other and our steps go in unison. These fools who think themselves loyal if they give up their active lives and bind themselves together into an exclusive One; then they have no common life but generally no life at all. If it weren&#x27;t so risky, one should one day tell the world what a marriage really is.&quot;

==Political thought==
Blücher encouraged his wife to become involved with Marxism and political theory, though ultimately her use of Karl Marx was in no way orthodox, as shown in such works as &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Human Condition&quot; (1958). Blücher also coined the term &quot;the anti-political principle&quot; to describe totalitarianism&#x27;s destruction of a &quot;space of resistance&quot; — a term taken up both by Arendt and Karl Jaspers.

Blücher believed, alongside Arendt and Martin Heidegger, that science held a corresponding mindset which threatened first religion, and now philosophy. He argued that this belief, which he saw best displayed in Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Science and the Modern World&quot;, was the same belief as the pre-socratic thinker Heraclitus. Namely, he saw science and Heraclitus agreeing on the claim that &quot;there is a rational order of things that is also a natural order of things&quot;. He also distinguished Heraclitus from metaphysics, arguing that &quot;Heraclitus, as well as Buddha, Socrates, Jesus, and all of the others we are considering here was an entirely non-mystical philosopher and also an entirely non-magical being.&quot; He saw Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle as indicative of a need for the development of an explicit and rigorous philosophy of science. He furthered this necessity by the invocation of the deification of science along Kantian lines, writing that the &quot;fact that at the very moment when man wanted to set a principle above himself and then failed to call that principle either God or the Absolute (because both are allowed), but rather chose something concrete to make into an absolute (like human reason or what not) --- this very fact indicates one thing, and that is whenever something concrete is taken to be an absolute it all boils down to the same contention, that man is God.&quot; Although, interestingly, he placed God as the result of morality, writing that &quot;there is not a single one, science, art, philosophy, politics, or religion, that does not have its root in the question of morality.&quot;

Blücher came to reject both religion and science as sources of morality, and instead posed what may be interpreted as a classical republican conception of freedom, writing that &quot;Everything we do involves an ethical and moral decision. We have to regain that freedom. We have believed for too long that we could be told what to do. They tried to tell us what to do on the authority of God; they tried to tell us what to do on the authority of science, and both no longer hold. We have to make up our own minds as to what we shall do and what we will do. That is the essence of freedom. It is not a freedom that is at hand. It is a freedom that has to be established, that has to be kept, and that has to be developed, or it vanishes like thin air.&quot;

==In popular culture==
=== &quot;Hannah Arendt&quot; (2012) ===

Axel Milberg plays Heinrich Blücher in the film which takes place during and after Arendt&#x27;s research and publication of &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;. Blücher is portrayed as a loving husband, who plays an active role in Arendt&#x27;s life. He is also shown to be active in the social circles Arendt and he travel in, posed in frequent heated debate with Hans Jonas. He is described in the movie as having followed Rosa Luxemburg &quot;to the end&quot;. In the movie he is seen deeply in love with Arendt, despite the indication of mutual infidelities that imply a marriage based in some form of polyamory. He is also shown as emotionally supportive of Arendt during the fallout from the aforementioned publication, consoling her on the loss of her friend Kurt Blumenfeld.

<text>(German for &quot;building up, construction&quot;) is a periodical targeted at German-speaking Jews around the globe. Founded in 1934 in New York City as a newspaper for German Jewish immigrants, it was reinvented in 2004 in Switzerland as a glossy magazine for German-speaking Jews of the 21st century. Hannah Arendt, Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann, and Stefan Zweig wrote for the original publication. Until 2004 it was published in New York City. It is now published in Zürich.

==History==
The &quot;&quot; was founded by the German–Jewish Club, which was later renamed the New World Club. The original purpose of the journal was as a monthly newsletter for the club, which included information and helpful facts for Jewish refugees.

== The Early Years of the &quot;Aufbau&quot; ==

=== 1934 ===
In December, the first issue of the journal was published.

=== 1935 ===
In February 1935, the &quot;Aufbau&quot; released its third publication that highlighted the Heinrich Heine, later renamed the Lorelei, Foundation in New York City, New York. Later that year in June, the &quot;Aufbau&quot; released an issue detailing pro-Nazi groups as a warning for readers in Yorkville. The passing of the Nuremberg Laws prompted the &quot;Aufbau&quot; to respond by continuing to publish their content. In November, the focus of the &quot;Aufbau&quot; changed. The focus of the journal shifted from primarily being about the club and community promotion, to depicting more of what was happening to Jewish people in German cities. The November issue was the beginning of the &quot;Aufbau&quot;&#x27;s evolution and expansion to not only New York Jewish communities, but Jewish communities everywhere.

=== 1938 ===
In November 1938, the primary mission for the &quot;Aufbau&quot; continued to evolve. This particular evolution in their mission was in response to Hitler gaining control of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. The &quot;Aufbau&quot; then began to strive for a greater sense of unity amongst the Jewish communities around the world by beginning to report on what the situations were like for those still in Europe as opposed to those who had immigrated to the United States.

=== 1939 ===
In February 1939, the &quot;Aufbau&quot; went through another transition. The general tone of the paper changed their design to focus more on the realities faced by the Jewish communities in Europe. For example, a particular issue highlighted the story of how an SS officer beat, humiliated, and tortured a group of German Jewish people as well as other acts against German Jewish people in similar situations.  This report was specific only to &quot;Aufbau&quot; because it did not meet American journalist standards because the source of the stories was anonymous. August marked the beginning of a new featured segment in &quot;Aufbau,&quot; titled &quot;March of Time&quot;. This addition to the paper served the purpose of creating a convenient list of news sources for Jewish communities.

Manfred George was nominated as the new editor in 1939.

====Manfred George====
The purpose of the publication changed markedly when, in 1939, Manfred George was nominated as the new editor. George took the journal from a monthly newsletter to one of the leading anti-Nazi publications of the German press in exile (&quot;&quot;). George, within the first 5 years of his tenure, took the circulation of the journal from 8,000 to 40,000. Before Manfred George became the editor of the &quot;Aufbau&quot;, he was a well-known editor of a Berlin daily, &quot;Tempo&quot;, and a left-wing journalist in the Weimar Republic

When George became the new editor, he added three major themes for the &quot;Aufbau&quot;. These three themes emphasized the connection between the German homeland and the newfound homeland of the United States. He encouraged a strong belief in Judaism and loyalty to the German culture.

In one of the first issues with George as editor, he emphasized the uncertainty present in the futures of Jewish people at the time and encouraged sympathy and neutrality. This issue was released shortly after Germany invaded Poland in September 1939.

=== 1940 ===
In 1940, &quot;Aufbau&quot; faced backlash because they were reporting the violence and incidents occurring against Jewish people in Europe. The backlash revolved around people not approving of their content nor finding it to be credible. The &quot;Aufbau&quot; editors responded by issuing a statement explaining that other publication&#x27;s readers did not necessarily care as much about the suffering of Jewish people as the &quot;Aufbau&quot; readers did.  Furthermore, editors explained that what the competing publications, like the New York Times, were currently publishing, the &quot;Aufbau&quot; had published weeks prior.

As of February 1940, the &quot;Aufbau&quot; was continuing to promote club events for the German-Jewish Club. In addition, throughout the summer, the journal highlighted various happenings and occurrences in American politics under the heading, “The Smoke-Filled Room”.  The purpose of this was to educate Jewish immigrants in the United States on mainstream American culture and practices, like the presidential election between Franklin D, Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie.

=== 1941 ===
In an effort to continue the support for Americanization, the &quot;Aufbau&quot; published an &quot;Aufbau Almanac&quot; called, &quot;The Immigrants Handbook&quot;.  This “handbook” was used as a how-to guide for new German-Jewish immigrants within the United States. It included 192 pages detailing American life and everything that someone might need to know, like the political system or the lyrics to the “Star Spangled Banner”.

== Archives, curated collections, and reproductions ==
All issued, from inception through 2004, are accessible online &quot;via&quot; The Leo Baeck Institute at .

===The &quot;Aufbau&quot; database===
From September 1, 1944, through September 27, 1946, the &#x27; printed numerous lists of Jewish Holocaust survivors located in Europe, as well as a few lists of victims. The data include information taken from lists which appeared between late 1944 and early 1947. The lists published in &#x27; were prepared by many different organizations, often by Jewish relief organizations or by officials in displaced persons&#x27; camps.

<doc id="618468" wikidata="Q70894" url="?curid=618468" title="Nick Saban">
<text>Nicholas Lou Saban Jr. ( ; born October 31, 1951) is an American sportscaster and former professional and college football coach. He serves as an analyst for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College GameDay&quot;, a television program covering college football. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest football coaches of all time. Saban served as head coach of the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s Miami Dolphins and at four universities: the University of Toledo, Michigan State University, Louisiana State University (LSU), and most famously the University of Alabama, where he last coached from 2007 to 2023 and led the team to six national championships in nine championship appearances during that period.

As a college football head coach, Saban won seven national titles, the most in college football history. His first came when he led the LSU Tigers to the BCS National Championship in 2003. He then coached the Alabama Crimson Tide to BCS and AP national championships in 2009, 2011, 2012, and to College Football Playoff championships in 2015, 2017 and 2020. He became the first coach in college football history to win a national championship with two different Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) schools since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936. Saban and Bear Bryant are the only coaches to win an SEC championship at two different schools. Saban&#x27;s career record as a college head coach is 292–71–1.

In 2013, Saban was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. He coached four Heisman Trophy winners at Alabama: Mark Ingram II (2009), Derrick Henry (2015), DeVonta Smith (2020), and Bryce Young (2021). In 2025, Saban will be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach.

==Early life and education==
Saban was born in Fairmont, West Virginia, to Mary and Nick Lou Saban Sr. His parents owned a small service station and his father founded and coached a youth football team. He grew up with a sister, Dianna, and graduated from Monongah High School in the small coal mining community of Monongah, West Virginia, about 25miles (40 km) southwest of Morgantown. Saban is of Croatian ancestry. His paternal grandfather, Stanko Saban, was born in 1895 in Gospić, in the Lika region of Croatia. Stanko emigrated to Portland, Oregon, in 1908, when he was 13 years old. He later married Anna Mihalic, of Croatian-American heritage.

Saban played quarterback on the 1968 West Virginia state championship team. Among his teammates were Kerry Marbury, who went on to star for the West Virginia Mountaineers and play in the Canadian Football League.

On December 18, 1971, Saban married Terry Constable, also from West Virginia. In 1973, he graduated from Kent State University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business. Saban played defensive back for Kent State under coach Don James. He and a roommate avoided being part of the Kent State shootings, on May 4, 1970, when they decided to eat lunch before walking to the rally area.

In 1975, Saban earned his master&#x27;s degree in sports administration from Kent State. Saban&#x27;s father died during his son&#x27;s first year of graduate school.

==Coaching career==
===Early coaching career===
Saban had not intended to enter the coaching ranks until Don James hired him as a graduate assistant at Kent State, while Saban waited for his wife to graduate. He later served as an assistant coach in NCAA Division I-A, at several schools: Syracuse in 1977, West Virginia in 1978 and 1979, Ohio State in 1980 and 1981, Navy in 1982, and Michigan State from 1983 to 1987.

After the 1987 season, Kent State passed over Saban for its vacant head coaching position and hired Dick Crum. Saban was then hired as an assistant for the Houston Oilers in the National Football League.

===Toledo===
Saban began his career as a head coach when he was hired by the University of Toledo on December 22, 1989. Coming off of 6–5 seasons in both 1988 and 1989, the Rockets found quick success under Nick Saban in 1990. With a 9–2 season, Toledo was co-champion of the Mid-American Conference. The two games the Rockets lost that season were by narrow margins: one point to Central Michigan and four points to Navy. While coaching in Toledo, Saban turned down an application from future head coach Urban Meyer, who was looking for any coaching job on Saban&#x27;s staff.

===Cleveland Browns===
The following February, Saban resigned as Toledo&#x27;s head coach after only one season in order to become defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns under head coach Bill Belichick. He remained in that position for four seasons. Saban helped lead the 1994 defensive unit for the Browns that was the best in the NFL in points allowed. Saban later said these four years were the &quot;worst of my life&quot;.

===Michigan State===
====1995–1997 seasons====
Saban became head coach of Michigan State prior to the 1995 season. Michigan State had not had a winning season since 1990, and the team was sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations that were committed under his predecessor and former mentor, George Perles.

Beginning in 1995, Saban moderately improved Michigan State&#x27;s fortunes, taking the Spartans to bowl games in each of his first three seasons. From 1995 to 1997, Michigan State finished 6–5–1, 6–6, and 7–5.

====1998 season====
On November 7, 1998, the Spartans upset the No.1 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes 28–24 at Ohio Stadium. However, even after the upset and an early-season rout of then-highly ranked Notre Dame the Spartans finished 6–6, including three last-minute losses featuring turnovers, defensive lapses, and special-teams misplays, and failed to earn a bowl invitation.

====1999 season====
Saban led the 1999 Spartans to a 9–2 season that included wins over Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, and Penn State. The two losses were routs at the hands of Purdue and Wisconsin. Following the final regular-season game against Penn State, Saban abruptly resigned to accept the head coaching position with LSU. Saban&#x27;s assistant head coach and successor, Bobby Williams, coached the Spartans to a Citrus Bowl victory over Florida, giving the Spartans an overall record of 10–2 for the 1999 season. It was the most wins for the Spartans in a season since 1965, and the Spartans reached their highest ranking since the 1966 team. Future NFL head coach Josh McDaniels served as a graduate assistant on Saban&#x27;s 1999 coaching staff.

===LSU===
====2000 season====
In November 1999, LSU named Nick Saban as their 31st head football coach. In 2000, the Tigers went 8–4 and won the Peach Bowl over Georgia Tech. The season was somewhat marred by several lopsided losses, including a 34–17 loss to the Auburn Tigers, and a 41–9 loss to the Florida Gators.

====2001 season====
Saban led LSU to a 10–3 record in 2001, including an SEC Championship and a Sugar Bowl victory. After a 35–24 loss to the Ole Miss Rebels, the Tigers finished the year with six straight wins, including a 31–20 win over #2 Tennessee in the 2001 SEC Championship Game, and a 47–34 win over Illinois in the 2002 Sugar Bowl. It was the first outright SEC championship for LSU since 1986, and the first time the Tigers had won the Sugar Bowl since 1968.

====2002 season====
The 2002 season opened with high expectations, but a 26–8 loss at the hands of Virginia Tech in the Tigers&#x27; season opener raised serious questions about their outlook. However, the Tigers would rebound to win their next six straight, but after a mid-season injury to quarterback Matt Mauck, LSU lost four of its last six games to close the season, including a 21–20 loss at Arkansas, which knocked the Tigers out of the SEC Championship Game. LSU also suffered a 35–20 loss to Texas in the Cotton Bowl Classic, and finished 8–5.

====2003 season====
The 2003 Tigers started the season with five wins, including a 17–10 victory in Tiger Stadium over the defending SEC champion, and then-undefeated, Georgia Bulldogs. LSU lost the following week to Florida, 19–7. After the loss to Florida, LSU did not lose again in the regular season and ended its regular season with a win over the Arkansas Razorbacks to win the SEC West. After winning the SEC West, the Tigers defeated the Georgia Bulldogs 34–13 in the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta. They were ranked No. 2 in the BCS standings and advanced to play the BCS No.1 Oklahoma Sooners in the Sugar Bowl, which was the host of the BCS Championship Game in 2003. The Tigers won the game 21–14. The win gave LSU the BCS national championship. and a 13–1 finish for the season. The 13 wins for LSU set a new single-season record, breaking the mark of 11 wins set by the 1958 National Championship team.

====2004 season====
LSU finished the 2004 season 9–3, after losing to the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Capital One Bowl 30–25 on a final play touchdown pass. Other losses that season were on the road at Auburn 10–9, and a loss on the road to Georgia 45–16. At the end of the 2004 season, Saban left LSU to coach the Miami Dolphins.

===Miami Dolphins===
====2005 season====
Saban accepted the head coaching position for the Miami Dolphins on December 25, 2004. He was the sixth coach in the franchise&#x27;s history. The Nick Saban era officially kicked off with a 34–10 win over the Denver Broncos in 2005. From there, however, the Dolphins struggled, losing seven of their next nine games to fall to 3–7. The two wins came over the Carolina Panthers and the New Orleans Saints, a game that took place in Tiger Stadium due to Hurricane Katrina. After a frustrating two months, however, the Dolphins would rally late in the season, as they won their final six games, including a 28–26 win to end the season in Foxboro, Massachusetts, over the New England Patriots. The team finished the year with a 9–7 record, and narrowly missed the playoffs in Saban&#x27;s first season.

====2006 season====
Going into the 2006 season, the Dolphins were expected to contend for a playoff spot. The season, however, turned out to be unsuccessful. The Dolphins were considering quarterback Drew Brees, who had just been released from the San Diego Chargers due to a career-threatening shoulder injury and subsequent contract dispute, but instead traded for Daunte Culpepper, who was still recovering from a knee injury from the previous season. Saban later said that the team&#x27;s decision to pass on Brees was the moment he knew that he would leave the team. Culpepper never fully recovered and was ultimately benched after the fourth game of the season, when the Dolphins lost to the Houston Texans. He was eventually put on injured reserve. After starting the season 1–6, however, the Dolphins got hot. They won four straight games, including wins over the Chicago Bears, who were previously unbeaten and made it to the Super Bowl that year, and the Kansas City Chiefs. Suddenly, the Dolphins were back in the playoff hunt at 5–6, but a 24–10 loss the following week to the Jacksonville Jaguars all but ended their playoff hopes. The Dolphins rebounded the following week with a 21–0 win over the New England Patriots, the Dolphins&#x27; last victory of the 2006 season. Quarterback Joey Harrington was eventually benched in favor of third-string quarterback Cleo Lemon. The defense ranked as a top-five unit in points and yards allowed. However, the offense was anemic, with the only bright spot being running back Ronnie Brown, who gained over 1,000 rushing yards on the season. The Dolphins lost their next two games to the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets to finish 6–10, Saban&#x27;s first losing season as a head coach.

On November 27, 2006, the University of Alabama announced the firing of head coach Mike Shula. Saban was rumored to be at the top of Alabama&#x27;s wish list, but Saban refused to discuss the job while his NFL season was still underway. During the month of December 2006, Saban was repeatedly questioned by the media about the Alabama job, and he repeatedly denied the rumors in his weekly press conferences, stating on December 21 &quot;I guess I have to say it. I&#x27;m not going to be the Alabama coach.&quot; But his wife Terry talked to Nick into having a meeting with Mal Moore. Saban met with Alabama officials on January 1, 2007, which was shortly after the Dolphins&#x27; season-ending loss to the Indianapolis Colts.

===Alabama===
====2007 season====
On January 3, 2007, following a meeting with Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, Saban announced that he had accepted an offer to become Alabama&#x27;s 27thhead coach. His initial eight-year contract totaling made him one of the highest-paid football coaches, professional or collegiate, in the United States at the time.

On January 4, 2007, at a press conference on the Alabama campus, Saban was officially introduced as the head football coach of The University of Alabama. On September 1, 2007, his Crimson Tide opened the season with a 52–6 win over the Western Carolina Catamounts, scoring more points than during any game in the 2006 season. Saban became the fifth Alabama coach since 1900 to start his first season 3–0, earning a win over then-ranked No.16 Arkansas Razorbacks. Alabama ended the regular season with a 6–6 record, including a four-game losing streak, a particularly humiliating loss at home to Louisiana-Monroe, and a sixth straight loss to Auburn in the Iron Bowl. All six of Alabama&#x27;s losses were by seven points or fewer. The Crimson Tide defeated Colorado in the 2007 Independence Bowl, 30–24, to end the year 7–6.

====2008 season====
During his second year as head coach of the Tide, Saban led his team from a sub-par season in 2007 to a perfect 12–0 regular season record. Saban finished the regular season undefeated for the first time in his career as a head coach as he led the Crimson Tide to its first undefeated regular season since 1994. He appeared on the September 1, 2008, cover of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as &quot;The Most Powerful Coach in Sports.&quot; 
His second season as Alabama head coach began with a 34–10 victory over the No.9 ranked Clemson Tigers in the Chick-fil-A College Kickoff in the Georgia Dome. Alabama won the next two games against Tulane and Western Kentucky before entering SEC play. In the following game, Alabama had a convincing 49–14 road-win over Arkansas. The Tide followed that victory with a 41–30 win over the No.3 ranked Georgia Bulldogs. After the Georgia game, the Tide won consecutive home games against the Kentucky Wildcats and the Ole Miss Rebels and finished the month of October with a 29–9 victory over the Tennessee Volunteers. Following a 35–0 homecoming victory over Arkansas State, the Crimson Tide rose to No.1 in all major polls in Week 10following a loss by No.1 Texas to the Texas Tech Red Raiders. It was the first time since the 1980 season that Alabama held the top spot during the regular season.

The Tide took their No.1 ranking into Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and came out with a 27–21 overtime victory over LSU. With the win, Alabama clinched its first SEC Western Division championship since 1999 and guaranteed the team a trip to the 2008 SEC Championship Game. The Tide then improved to 11–0 with a win at home over Mississippi State. To finish the regular season, Bama defeated in-state rival Auburn, 36–0, the largest margin of victory in the series since 1962. It was Alabama&#x27;s first victory over Auburn since the 2001 season. In the SEC Championship Game, Alabama suffered its first defeat in a 31–20 loss to the SEC Eastern Division champion Florida Gators (who later won the 2008 BCS Championship), and closed out the season with a 31–17 loss to Utah in the Sugar Bowl to finish the season at 12–2. For his efforts during the season, Saban received several Coach of the Year awards.

====2009 season====

No.5 Alabama began Saban&#x27;s third year by defeating the No.7 ranked Virginia Tech Hokies in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, 34–24. The Crimson Tide followed up with wins over Florida International and North Texas. The following week Alabama won its conference opener over Arkansas, 35–7. In its fifth game of the year, Alabama beat Kentucky, 38–20. The sixth game of the season featured a hard-fought defensive battle with Bama defeating Ole Miss, 22–3.

Following a 45–0 shutout of Chattanooga, on Black Friday, Alabama came from behind to defeat Gene Chizik&#x27;s Auburn Tigers, 26–21, marking the first time since 1973–1974 Alabama had finished the regular season undefeated in consecutive years, and the first consecutive 12-win seasons. The Crimson Tide defeated the Florida Gators in the SEC Championship, 32–13, in a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s championship game. The championship represented Alabama&#x27;s 22nd SEC title and its first since 1999. Saban&#x27;s Crimson Tide ended the season with a 37–21 victory over the Texas Longhorns in the 2010 BCS National Championship Game to finish a perfect 14–0 to give Alabama their first National Championship since 1992. The 2009 Crimson Tide set a school record for single-season victories with 14. The win secured Saban&#x27;s second national championship and Alabama&#x27;s 13th, and its first in the BCS era. At the on-campus celebration, Saban famously stated &quot;I want everybody here to know, this is not the end. This is the beginning.&quot; Following the victory over the Longhorns, the University of Alabama announced that it would unveil a statue of Saban in the week prior to the kickoff of the 2010 season. On April 16, 2011, a life-sized bronzed statue of Saban was unveiled at the 2011 A-Day spring game, making him Alabama&#x27;s fifth coach to be immortalized outside the north end zone of Bryant–Denny Stadium.

====2013 season====
As the 2013 campaign began, Saban&#x27;s Crimson Tide was ranked No.1 in both the AP and Coaches preseason polls for the first time since 2010. In the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, Alabama defeated Virginia Tech 35–10 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.

The next game was the Iron Bowl, which was hosted by #4 Auburn in a matchup between top five teams. The game was tied 28–28 with only a single second remaining in regulation, as Alabama and Auburn appeared headed for overtime. Extra time wasn&#x27;t necessary as Saban decided to attempt a 56-yard field goal instead of either running out the clock or attempting a Hail Mary from Auburn&#x27;s 39-yard line. The decision proved costly, as the field goal was short but caught nine yards deep in the Auburn end zone by the Tigers&#x27; Chris Davis, who returned the failed attempt 109 yards for a touchdown as time expired. The 28–34 loss knocked Alabama out of contention for the SEC Championship and dashed The Tide&#x27;s hope for a national championship. Alabama finished the regular season 11–1 for the third consecutive year. At the end of the regular season, Alabama finished ranked No.3 in the final BCS rankings and earned an at-large bid to the 2014 Sugar Bowl.

<doc id="618480" wikidata="Q527834" url="?curid=618480" title="Andy Taylor (guitarist)">
<text>Andrew James Taylor (born 16 February 1961) is an English guitarist, best known as a former member of Duran Duran and the Power Station. He has also recorded and performed as a solo artist, and served as a guitarist, songwriter, and record producer for the likes of Robert Palmer, Rod Stewart, the Almighty, Thunder, Love and Money, Mark Shaw, Then Jerico, C. C. Catch, Paul Rodgers (with the Law), Belinda Carlisle, and Gun.

==History==
===Background / early musical career===
Andrew Taylor was born in Tynemouth and raised in the town of Cullercoats, Northumberland, in North East England, and attended Marden High School. He began playing guitar at the age of eleven and was soon playing with local bands, even producing one at the age of 16. He received guitar tuition from Dave Black, a member of the short-lived, post-David Bowie version of Bowie&#x27;s sometime backing band The Spiders from Mars. He dropped out of school early to tour England and Europe with several different bands, playing working men&#x27;s clubs and air force bases. Then in April 1980, as Taylor puts it, &quot;I made that fateful train journey down to Birmingham.&quot;

===Duran Duran===
Duran Duran began their rise to fame at a Birmingham club named the Rum Runner. The club was owned by their managers and mentors, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow. It was centred on the music and ostentatious fashion of the era, particularly disco music, which had fused with punk and electronic to create the sound and look adopted by various New Romantic acts of the time.

Andy Taylor joined the band in April 1980 and has been credited for playing a vital role in shaping and developing their early songs, working creatively with Nick Rhodes playing around the keyboardist&#x27;s patterns and solidifying the melodies, and assisting in forming the band&#x27;s &quot;rough, undisciplined mixture[s]&quot; of punk, disco and electronic styles into tight, cohesive structures.

The band signed to EMI Records in December 1980, only seven months after completing their line-up. Their debut single &quot;Planet Earth&quot; was released shortly after that, with their self-titled debut album, &quot;Duran Duran&quot;, released in June 1981. By 1983, the band was a global success story.

===The Power Station and Robert Palmer===

While Duran Duran were on hiatus in 1985, Andy Taylor and bassist John Taylor joined session drummer and former Chic member Tony Thompson and Robert Palmer to form the Power Station. Their eponymous album, recorded mostly at the New York studio after which the band was named, reached the top 20 in the UK and top 10 in the US, spawning two hit singles with &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (UK number 14, US number 6) and a cover of the T. Rex song &quot;Get It On (Bang a Gong)&quot; (UK number 22, US number 9). Palmer performed live with the band only once that year, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. After Palmer bowed out at the last moment to go back into the studio to further his newly revitalized solo career , the band toured and even played Live Aid with singer Michael Des Barres as well as making an appearance on a &quot;Miami Vice&quot; season two episode, &quot;Whatever Works&quot;. Taylor also performed with Duran Duran at the Live Aid event.

Palmer recorded the album &quot;Riptide&quot; in 1985, recruiting Thompson and Andy Taylor to play on some tracks and Power Station producer Bernard Edwards, who worked with Thompson in the group Chic, to lead the production. Palmer recruited Wally Badarou, another Compass Point Star, who had laid synthesizer tracks on the Power Station album plus his long-term drummer, Dony Wynn, for this production as well.

Taylor said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think any of us could have known at the time that this little venture would lead to the breakup of DD but it did or at least it exposed the cracks in the pavement. I think we were all surprised at the amount of success the project achieved, particularly Robert, whose career was reignited in the USA. It was an extraordinary time, everything we were associated with just flew off the shelves. As well as being the opportunity to express a major musical statement, I guess it was also as much of a statement against the label demands.&quot;

===Solo and production===
After six years of being a member of Duran Duran, Taylor had realized both the band and he were in freefall. He and the other members rarely spoke to each other with the band now living on three different continents. Taylor himself was based in Los Angeles, where he met with ex-Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones and they began collaborating for Taylor&#x27;s forthcoming solo album.

In the meantime, he recorded the hit single &quot;Take It Easy&quot; (US number 24), which was used as the theme song for the movie &quot;American Anthem&quot;. Ex-Missing Persons members Terry Bozzio and Patrick O&#x27;Hearn performed drums and bass, respectively, on the song and video. Two other songs by Taylor and Jones also appeared on the album: &quot;Wings of Love&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;. Taylor also contributed to the &quot;Miami Vice II&quot; soundtrack album with the song &quot;When the Rain Comes Down&quot; (US number 43). It was followed by his first solo album, &quot;Thunder&quot; (1987). O&#x27;Hearn again played bass for him on the album and during the following tour. Also on the &quot;Thunder&quot; world tour were guitarist Paul Hanson (guitarist) and drummer John Valen. Hanson, Valen and O&#x27;Hearn also appeared with Taylor in the music video for the second single from the &quot;Thunder&quot; album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Die Young&quot;. Despite moderate success in the US, Taylor&#x27;s solo material failed to catch on in his native UK.

Throughout 1987 and 1988, Taylor co-wrote and co-produced Rod Stewart&#x27;s multi-platinum album &quot;Out of Order&quot; along with Chic members Bernard Edwards and Tony Thompson (the latter of whom had also performed with him in Power Station), spawning the &quot;Billboard&quot; hits, &quot;Lost in You&quot;, &quot;Forever Young&quot;, and &quot;My Heart Can&#x27;t Tell You No&quot;.

Taylor also contributed a cover of &quot;Dead on the Money&quot; to the &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; soundtrack in 1988. (Taylor&#x27;s former band Duran Duran also allowed one of their own songs, &quot;Do You Believe in Shame?&quot;, to be included on the album.) A second solo album, consisting of entirely cover versions, entitled &quot;Dangerous&quot;, was released in 1990.

Taylor then moved on to producing full time, working with several successful UK bands during the 1990s. He produced the debut album &quot;Back Street Symphony&quot; by London rockers Thunder and their follow up &quot;Laughing on Judgement Day&quot;. It was followed by the Almighty album &quot;Soul Destruction&quot; and then Mark Shaw&#x27;s album &quot;Almost&quot;. Taylor based himself in his now refurbished Trident Studios in London with then manager and partner Rob Hallett until 1994 when he returned to Los Angeles to write and produce tracks for a second Power Station album and the 1995 Rod Stewart album &quot;A Spanner in the Works&quot;.

===Reunions===
Taylor participated in the 1994 reunion of Power Station. They recorded a second album &quot;Living in Fear&quot; for EMI. During the course of this album, Bernard Edwards died in his hotel room after a Chic gig in Tokyo. The band were shellshocked at his sudden death, but vowed to continue as a trio and complete the project. They subsequently finished the album with Canadian engineer/producer Mike Fraser, with a Japanese and US tours to follow to promote the record.

In 2000, Taylor reunited with the other original members of Duran Duran to record their first new music together since 1985. The band secured a new recording contract with Sony Records. Their ensuing album, 2004 &quot;Astronaut&quot;, featured a blend of Taylor&#x27;s heavy guitar with the synth hooks of the classic Duran Duran sound. The first single, &quot;(Reach Up for The) Sunrise&quot;, reached number five in the UK, and the album reached number three (number 17 in the US).

Months prior to the album&#x27;s release, the band played their largest-ever UK tour in the spring of 2004, which was followed by a world tour in 2005, including Asia, Europe, South America, and North America. The band also performed at Live 8.

In 2006, whilst recording a new Duran Duran album, Taylor once again parted ways with the band. The subsequent album, titled &quot;Reportage&quot;, was scrapped by the band after his departure. More recently, Taylor strongly hinted in his blogs that Duran Duran&#x27;s management company were partly responsible for his departure. This was confirmed when &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (UK) printed a retraction on 4 May 2008.

A short controversy followed as Taylor wrote in his 2008 autobiography that there was no &quot;blunt message&quot; and that in addition to the problems of writing and recording &quot;Reportage&quot;, old conflicts between other band members and himself had resurfaced. The other band members have maintained their version, in which Andy Taylor&#x27;s chronic inexplicable absences are pointed out. The band issued a statement in the wake of his departure, stating they &quot;will be continuing as Duran Duran without Andy, as we have reached a point in our relationship with him where there is an unworkable gulf between us and we can no longer effectively function together&quot;.

In 2019, Andy ended his 13-year hiatus from music and started to tour again, releasing a new single.

After touring with British rock band Reef in 2020, Taylor went on to produce their new album &quot;Shoot Me Your Ace&quot;, which was released in April 2022.

In March 2023 Taylor rejoined Duran Duran to record a new album, &quot;Danse Macabre,&quot; which was released in November of 2023. Taylor also released &quot;Man&#x27;s a Wolf to Man,&quot; his first solo effort in 33 years.

===RockAffairs===
In November 2007, Taylor co-founded RockAffairs.com alongside Sarah Eaglesfield, the former Flightside vocalist and webmistress at duranduran.com. RockAffairs was developed to allow unsigned artists to sell MP3s and merchandise, promote their band and keep 100% of the profit. It also pioneered a maverick profit share scheme where all income from listener signups was distributed amongst bands who sign up for the scheme.

In June 2008, Taylor handed control of the website over to Eaglesfield. As of 2017, Taylor remains the owner of RockAffairs Ltd in the UK. Rockaffairs has announced it will be returning for one week of special 10th-anniversary broadcasts during summer 2018.

===Autobiography===
In 2008, Taylor published an autobiography, &quot;Wild Boy: My Life in Duran Duran&quot;, in which he tells his life&#x27;s story from youth in an extended family to his life with wife Tracey. The book aims to give a backstage look on Duran Duran&#x27;s rise and a survey of the band&#x27;s career album by album, as well as of Taylor&#x27;s solo works and collaborations. It also deals with the iconic status of Duran Duran in the time of early MTV and the band&#x27;s issues with drugs and alcohol.

== Personal life ==
In 2022, Taylor stated that he has been married to his wife Tracey for 40 years. They have four children. The couple currently reside in Ibiza, Spain.

When Duran Duran were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022, Taylor was unable to attend the ceremony. During the event, Simon Le Bon read part of a letter that Taylor had written revealing he had been diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer four years prior and a recent setback kept him from attending. The letter was later posted to the band&#x27;s website, in which Taylor said his condition is incurable but not immediately life-threatening.

<text>Keren Jane Woodward (born 2 April 1961) is an English singer/songwriter and, with Sara Dallin and Siobhan Fahey, a founding member of the girl group Bananarama. In 1986, the trio reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with their version of &quot;Venus&quot;. Woodward and Dallin are the only constant members of Bananarama, and both have been a part of the group for over 40 years since 1979.

== Early life ==

Woodward is a classically-trained pianist; she sang in choirs and performed in amateur dramatics with Dallin, whom she has known since childhood. After leaving school, Woodward worked as a pensions clerk at the BBC in Portland Place, London.

== Career ==
Woodward formed Bananarama with Dallin and Fahey, releasing their first single &quot;Aie a Mwana&quot; in 1981. They went on to have a string of UK top-ten hits and top the American charts in 1986 with &quot;Venus&quot;. Fahey left the band in 1988, to be replaced by Jacquie O&#x27;Sullivan, who left in 1991.

Woodward and Dallin have performed as a duo from 1991. They briefly reunited with Fahey in April 2017 and received the Icon Award at the Glamour Awards in June 2017. The trio toured the UK in November and December 2017 and North America in February 2018. They performed their final dates as a trio in August 2018.

== Personal life ==
In the mid-1980s, Woodward had a relationship with model David Scott-Evans, with whom she had a son born on 31 December 1986. 

In 1990, Woodward began dating Andrew Ridgeley, formerly of the musical duo Wham! They lived with her son in a 15th-century converted barn in Wadebridge in North Cornwall. They ended their relationship in November 2017.

<text>Melinda Patrice &quot;Mindy&quot; Clarke (born April 24, 1969) is an American actress. She is known for portraying Faith Taylor on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (1989–1990), Julie Cooper on Fox&#x27;s teen drama series &quot;The O.C.&quot; (2003–2007), Lady Heather on CBS&#x27;s crime drama series &quot;&quot; (2001–2015) and Amanda on the action thriller series &quot;Nikita&quot; (2010–2013).

==Early life==
Clarke was raised in Dana Point, California. She is the daughter of actor John Clarke. Clarke is one of three siblings, and her sister, Heidi, died in 1994 of a malignant heart tumor.

== Career ==
Clarke appeared on the daytime soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Faith Taylor (where her father was a senior cast member), and starred in the television series &quot;Soldier of Fortune, Inc.&quot; (1997–1999). She also guest-starred on &quot;&quot; (1997) as the Amazon chieftain Velasca, &quot;Firefly&quot; (2003) the brothel madam Nandi, &quot;Charmed&quot; (2002) as the Siren, and has had six appearances on &quot;&quot; (2001–2011) where she played dominatrix Lady Heather. She also appeared in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Muffin Tops&quot;, playing Jerry&#x27;s girlfriend who likes anything hairless. In 1993, she played a lead role in the horror film &quot;Return of the Living Dead 3&quot;.
She portrayed Julie Cooper in the teen drama series &quot;The O.C.,&quot; that aired on the Fox network from August 5, 2003, to February 22, 2007, running a total of four seasons. Clarke&#x27;s character Julie Cooper was often characterized as devious and selfish, with &quot;USA Today&quot; calling her a &quot;shallow vixen&quot;. However, she revealed a more vulnerable side of herself a number of times during the series. Clarke was originally billed as a guest star in the first few episodes in which she appeared, but due to fan response was offered a series regular contract. Clarke accepted the role and her character became an integral part of the show&#x27;s storylines.

In July 2009, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The O.C.&quot; character Julie Cooper at No. 3 on their list of &quot;21 Top TV Bitches&quot;. In January 2021, &quot;Vogue&quot; wrote about the fashion choices on &quot;The O.C.&quot;, commenting: &quot;Speaking of the Coopers, I also want to end by saying Julie Cooper (Melinda Clarke), Marissa&#x27;s mom, is so underrated during this whole series. First of all, she&#x27;s gorgeous. Secondly, she commands every single room she walks into, whether it&#x27;s in a pink Juicy Couture tracksuit or a groovy, off-the-shoulder top. Clearly Marissa got all her fashion sense from her.&quot;

Clarke has appeared on HBO&#x27;s comedy-drama series &quot;Entourage&quot; (2005–2011) as a fictionalized version of herself, married to Malcolm McDowell&#x27;s character Terrance McQuewick. Clarke portrayed Blithe Meacham in the television film &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; (2007), which was produced by Kelly Rowan. She had guest roles in several television shows, including &quot;Chuck&quot; (2007), &quot;Reaper&quot; (2007) and &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; (2010). In 2010, she appeared on The CW show &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; (2010–2017) as Kelly Donovan, a mother who discovers her daughter has died. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised her performance as Kelly by saying: &quot;In a scene without any dialogue, Clarke made Kelly&#x27;s grief believable and powerful.&quot;
In 2010, she landed one of the main roles in The CW&#x27;s action drama series &quot;Nikita&quot; as Helen &quot;Amanda&quot; Collins. Clarke&#x27;s character was the main antagonist in the show&#x27;s third and fourth season. The series concluded after four seasons on December 27, 2013. She has lent her voice to several voice acting projects, voicing Alexa in &quot;The Animatrix: Matriculated&quot; (2003), Sofia Ivanescu in the video game &quot;Mission Impossible: Operation Surma&quot; (2003), Madame Macmu-Ling in &quot;&quot; (2006), and Charlene in &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (2008).

In April 2021, Clarke and her former &quot;The O.C.&quot; co-star Rachel Bilson launched a weekly podcast titled &quot;Welcome to the OC, Bitches!&quot; The podcast focuses on the hosts and guests re-watching and discussing episodes of &quot;The O.C.&quot; In August 2021, the podcast was named one of &quot;7 Top Celebrity Podcasts You Should Subscribe To Right Now&quot; by &quot;Bustle&quot;. In December 2023, Clarke announced that she is launching a new podcast, &quot;Beyond the OC&quot;, hosted by Clarke and her daughter. The podcast was launched on April 25, 2024.

== Public image ==
Two action figures have been made of Clarke. The first was for her role as Jessica Priest in &quot;Spawn&quot; (1997) and the second was for her role as Velasca from the television series &quot;&quot; (1997). In August 2005, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked her at No. 5 on their list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top Ten Scene Stealers&quot;. Clarke has often portrayed characters that are tough, manipulative and villains. In 2011, she said that fans and viewers of &quot;Nikita&quot; wanted her character Amanda to be &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;as bad as possible&quot;. Clarke described her &quot;The O.C.&quot; character Julie Cooper by saying: &quot;You believe your character&#x27;s truth—and her truth was maintaining this beautiful façade. Physically and monetarily. But ultimately she is an outsider, and that&#x27;s what Josh has explained is the biggest theme of this show: everyone is really an outsider. They were one, or they become an outsider, or they feel like an outsider.&quot;

During her career, Clarke has appeared in magazine covers and pictorials such as &quot;In Touch Weekly,&quot; &quot;Fangoria,&quot; and &quot;Regard&quot; magazine.

== Personal life ==
Clarke was married to Ernie Mirich from 1997 to 2005, and they have a daughter born in 2000. In September 2015, Clarke married Adam Farmer in a ceremony held in Dana Point, California.

<text>Richard John Parfitt, (12 October 1948 24 December 2016) was an English musician, best known as a rhythm guitarist, singer and songwriter with rock band Status Quo.

Parfitt began his career in the early 1960s, playing in pubs and holiday camps. He joined Status Quo in 1967 when they were looking for an additional singer. He wrote songs for the band and remained with them for 49 years. He occasionally guested with other bands, and recorded an unreleased solo album in 1985. In 2016, Parfitt temporarily retired from touring with the band due to ill health, and died in December of that year. His only solo album, &quot;Over and Out&quot;, was released posthumously in 2018.

==Early life==
Richard John Parfitt was born in Woking, Surrey, on 12 October 1948. His father Richard was an insurance salesman &quot;who was a drinker and a gambler&quot;, and his mother Lillian worked in cake shops. He described his upbringing as &quot;wonderful&quot;, and described his childhood-self as a &quot;typical naughty boy&quot;. He first started to learn to play the guitar at the age of 11.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1963 Parfitt was playing guitar and singing in The Prince of Wales Feathers, a pub on Warren Street in Camden, London, when his father was approached by an agent from Sunshine Holiday Camp on Hayling Island, who gave Parfitt a performing job. At the camp Parfitt joined Jean and Gloria Harrison – performing as the double act The Harrison Twins – to form a cabaret trio called The Highlights. Following the season, the Harrison Twins&#x27; manager Joe Cohen – who had been one of the Keystone Cops – arranged for The Highlights to perform at Butlins in Minehead. Here, Parfitt met future Status Quo partner Francis Rossi, who was playing with Alan Lancaster and John Coghlan in a band called The Spectres (soon to be renamed Traffic Jam) – a forerunner to Status Quo. &quot;I remember wandering over there one afternoon for the first time and watching them rehearse,&quot; Parfitt recalled. &quot;I may still have been in my silver lamé suit, which I used to wear all the time. They were playing &quot;[Chuck Berry&#x27;s]&quot; &#x27;Bye Bye Johnny&#x27; and it sounded absolutely fantastic.&quot;

After Parfitt befriended the band, their manager Pat Barlow invited him to join, as they needed another singer.

===Status Quo ===
In 1967, Traffic Jam changed their name to The Status Quo (they soon dropped the definite article and later still would often be known simply as &#x27;Quo&#x27;), beginning Parfitt&#x27;s almost 50-year career in the band. Early successes came with the Rossi-penned hit &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot;. The single became the group&#x27;s only Top 40 hit in the United States, peaking at number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100. Though the follow-up was the unsuccessful single, &quot;Black Veils of Melancholy&quot;, they had a hit again the same year with a Marty Wilde and Ronnie Scott song, &quot;Ice in the Sun&quot;, which climbed to number eight. The band&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Piledriver&quot;, which reached number 5, spent a total of 37 weeks on the UK Albums Chart.

The band&#x27;s more popular songs during the early 1970s include &quot;Paper Plane&quot; (no 42 in the German music chart) (1972), &quot;Caroline&quot; (no 36 in the German music chart) (1973), &quot;Down Down&quot; (no 14 in the Austrian music chart) (1975), &quot;Rain&quot; (no 27 in the German music chart) (1976), &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot; (No 29 in the New Zealand music chart) (1977) and &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; (no 24 in the Australian Music Chart) (1979). &quot;Down Down&quot; topped the UK Singles Chart in January 1975, becoming their only UK number one single to date. In 1976, they signed a pioneering sponsorship deal with Levi&#x27;s.

The 1976 hit &quot;Mystery Song&quot;, co-written with Bob Young, was composed after Rossi had laced Parfitt&#x27;s tea with amphetamine sulphate during the sessions for the &quot;Blue for You&quot; album. Rossi later said: &quot;He was playing the riff when we left the studio, and he was still playing it when we came back the next day!&quot;

Quo were highly successful in Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand throughout the 1980s and 90s, and were the opening act for 1985&#x27;s Live Aid, and they continued to be successful to the present day. By February 2015 they had sold over 118 million records worldwide. In 2013 and 2014, Parfitt and Rossi reunited temporarily with original Quo bandmates Alan Lancaster and John Coghlan for a series of reunion concerts on what would be called the &quot;Frantic Four&quot; tour.

Parfitt and Rossi were appointed Officers of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the New Year Honours 2010.

At the time of Parfitt&#x27;s death, he was the longest lasting member of Status Quo aside from Francis Rossi; who co-founded the band in 1962. He wrote some of their greatest hits, also in collaboration with the group&#x27;s keyboard player Andy Bown, among them &quot;Whatever You Want&quot;, &quot;Again and Again&quot;, and &quot;Rain&quot;.

===Solo endeavours and other projects===

In 1984, the year before Quo would open Live Aid, Parfitt and Rossi appeared on the Band Aid charity single, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;. Bob Geldof asked Parfitt and Rossi to take part, knowing that although the group were from an entirely different musical era and background, their consistent chart success and fame would bring a certain amount of credibility to the project from the rock fraternity and ensure that the group&#x27;s loyal following of fans (the &quot;Quo Army&quot;) would support the cause and buy the record in large numbers.

Parfitt played guitar on the song &quot;It&#x27;s an Illusion&quot; recorded for the 1984 album &quot;Strange Frontier&quot; by Roger Taylor.

Parfitt wrote and recorded a solo album &quot;Recorded Delivery&quot; in 1985, but it was never released. Among the musicians on the record were bassist John &quot;Rhino&quot; Edwards and drummer Jeff Rich, formerly with the Climax Blues Band and Judie Tzuke. Edwards and Rich were subsequently invited by Parfitt to join Status Quo.

In 2006 Parfitt released his guitar refacing overlay invention, the &quot;guitar facelift&quot;, which was licensed by guitar manufacturer Fender.

In December 2009, Parfitt teamed up with Rolf Harris for the single &quot;Christmas in the Sun&quot;, following on from the 2008 Status Quo hit &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas Time&quot; which Parfitt wrote with Wayne Morris.

In 2013, Parfitt and Rossi starred as themselves in &quot;Bula Quo!&quot;, a comedy film in which the duo find themselves becoming accidentally involved with mafia operations on Fiji. The film was generally poorly-received by critics. An album was released alongside the film.

In April 2015, in partnership with Julian Hall and his wife Lyndsay, Parfitt set up &quot;Status Homes&quot;, a real estate company based in Marbella, Spain.

On 1 December 2017, a press release from the earMusic record label on Status Quo&#x27;s website announced that &quot;Over and Out&quot;, a solo album planned by Parfitt, would be released posthumously on 23 March 2018. Parfitt had worked on the album during his hiatus from the band following a heart attack in 2016, completing vocal and guitar tracks, but dying before he had had an opportunity to produce it. Guest musicians helping to complete the album included Brian May of Queen, Chris Wolstenholme of Muse, former Status Quo bassist Alan Lancaster and current bassist John &quot;Rhino&quot; Edwards and co-produced by Parfitt&#x27;s son Rick Parfitt Jnr. The album entered the UK charts in its first week of release at number 3 and the German album charts at number 10.

==Musical equipment==
One of Parfitt&#x27;s guitars, the one synonymous with his legendary image was a white 1965 Fender Telecaster. Prior to acquiring this instrument, he played a late 1967 Fender Custom Telecaster in Ice Blue Metallic finish, with a rosewood fretboard. In his career, he also played a Gibson SG Junior, a 1981 Zemaitis tuned to a B, a Schecter Telecaster, a Fender Esquire, a custom-made Fender Telecaster Thinline, a Gibson Melody Maker and a Chet Atkins acoustic guitar. He also used Status Slipstream guitars in different configurations. For amplification, Parfitt used Marshall JCM800kk (Kerry King signature) or JCM900 amplifiers with 4x12 cabinets, combined with VOX AC30 amplifiers and a Roland GP8 signal processor and a Boss GE-7 as his clean boost pedal.

==Personal life==
===Drugs, alcohol and health issues===
Following a heart attack, Parfitt had a quadruple heart bypass in 1997, when he was told by doctors that he could die &quot;at any time&quot; unless he changed his lifestyle of drugs, smoking and heavy drinking. At the height of the band&#x27;s fame, Parfitt and his long-time Status Quo partner Francis Rossi were notorious for drinking and drug use, with Parfitt claiming to have been spending up to £1,000 a week on cocaine, and up to £500 a week on vodka. In his later life, following several health issues, Parfitt led a more sober life, stating in a 2014 interview that he had not smoked cannabis for 27 years and had not used cocaine for 10 years.

He had a throat cancer scare in December 2005. He suffered a heart attack in December 2011 and underwent surgery on the following day.

On 1 August 2014, while on a European tour with Status Quo, Parfitt was hospitalised in Pula, Croatia, forcing the cancellation of six shows on the tour. He had suffered a heart attack while on his tour bus after performing a concert in Austria, and had a stent inserted.

On 14 June 2016, after playing with the band in Antalya, Turkey, he suffered another heart attack and was hospitalised again. His management described his condition as serious. Parfitt was clinically dead for several minutes, resulting in mild cognitive impairments. The band announced that their ongoing tour would continue with Freddie Edwards, son of bassist John &quot;Rhino&quot; Edwards, as a temporary replacement. On 22 June it was announced that Parfitt had been flown home to the UK and was described as &quot;comfortable&quot; in hospital in London, where he was undergoing more tests. He had a defibrillator fitted into his chest. In September 2016 it was announced that he would not be well enough to tour in the autumn, and he did not intend to tour with the band for the foreseeable future.

===Family and relationships===
In 1973, Parfitt married his first wife, Marietta Boeker, and in 1974 they had their first son, Richard, better known as Rick Parfitt Jr., a sports car racer and musician. The couple also had a daughter, Heidi, who drowned in the family swimming pool at the age of two.

This tragedy, combined with Parfitt&#x27;s alcohol abuse and cocaine habit, led to the couple divorcing. Parfitt was linked romantically to Page 3 girl and glamour model Debee Ashby in the mid-1980s. He went on to marry his second wife and former girlfriend, Patty Beeden, in 1988. They had a son, Harry, in 1989. They divorced eight years later in 1996 when Rick Parfitt had an affair with Marietta Boeker. Patty wrote a book about their life together in 1998 entitled &quot;Laughing All Over the World: My Life Married to Status Quo.&quot;

Parfitt subsequently became engaged to fitness instructor Lyndsay Whitburn, whom he married in 2006 after a three-month courtship. The couple remained married for the remainder of Parfitt&#x27;s life, and had twins Tommy and Lily in 2008, although by the time of Parfitt&#x27;s death, the couple had been separated for several months.

==Death and tributes==
Parfitt died in a Marbella hospital at lunchtime on 24 December 2016 from sepsis, after being admitted on Thursday evening, 22 December, following an infection of a pre-existing shoulder injury. His funeral was held at Woking Crematorium on 19 January 2017.

Following the news of his death, friends and associates of the band took to social media to express their condolences. Among these were Brian May of Queen, the Who, Peter Frampton and broadcaster Chris Tarrant, on whose show – &quot;Tiswas&quot; – Status Quo appeared. Former and current bandmates including drummer Jeff Rich also offered condolences. A tribute page dedicated to Parfitt appeared on the band&#x27;s official website including messages from Francis Rossi and manager Simon Porter, as well as on the website of former Quo drummer John Coghlan. Coghlan personally paid tribute to Parfitt at a concert with his spin-off band, John Coghlan&#x27;s Quo, at The Half Moon, Putney on 30 December 2016, during which he read out a poem by a fan entitled &quot;The Rhythm King&quot;. Parfitt was cremated on 19 January 2017.

In June 2017, a blue plaque to Parfitt was unveiled on Jubilee Square, in his hometown of Woking. Among the attendees were Coghlan, and Parfitt&#x27;s son Rick Parfitt Jr.

<text>Robert Earl &quot;Kool&quot; Bell (born October 8, 1950), also known by the name Muhammad Bayyan, is an American musician, singer and songwriter. He is the last surviving founding member of the American R&amp;B, soul, funk and disco band Kool &amp; the Gang. 

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Bell was born in Youngstown, Ohio, to Aminah Bayyan (1932–2014) and Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Bell (1929–1985). Bell grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey. Growing up, Bell was nicknamed &quot;Kool&quot;, due to being &quot;laid back&quot;: 
=== Kool &amp; The Gang ===

Along with his brother, Ronald Bell, he began playing jazz, and in 1964 they formed a group named The Jazziacs. They began playing at clubs in New York City under a series of different band names before settling on the name Kool &amp; the Gang in 1968. Their debut album, &quot;Kool and the Gang&quot;, was released the following year. The band&#x27;s first major hit came in 1973, with &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot;, which charted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. Their first number one hit single was &quot;Spirit of the Boogie&quot;, which was released in 1975.

Bell, along with Kool &amp; the Gang members James &quot;J.T.&quot; Taylor and Dennis Thomas, were a part of the 1984 charity supergroup Band Aid.

Kool &amp; the Gang have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, seven American Music Awards, and, in 2006, a Music Business Association Chairman&#x27;s Award for artistic achievement. The band recorded nine No. 1 R&amp;B singles in the 1970s and 1980s, including its No. 1 pop single &quot;Celebration&quot;. They have seven American Music Awards, 25 Top Ten R&amp;B hits, nine Top Ten Pop hits, and 31 gold and platinum albums. The group is honored on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. As of 2024, Bell still tours with Kool &amp; the Gang.

In 2024, Bell was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of Kool &amp; the Gang.

== Personal life ==
Bell&#x27;s younger brother, Ronald Bell, was also a musician, and co-formed the band with Robert in 1964. Both brothers converted to Islam in 1972. Ronald died of undisclosed causes on September 9, 2020.

In 1971, Robert married Deborah Jones. Bell and Jones met when they were teenagers. Deborah died on November 4, 2018, aged 67. Her death was later revealed to have been the result of a long-standing illness. Together, they had a son, who has worked with Kool &amp; the Gang in the past.

Shortly after the war was over the crew was sent ashore to aid the local populace in the disaster recovery operations, providing navigational landmarks for ships located in Stanley Sound and attempting to refloat the high commissioner&#x27;s barge (but failing); also providing well deserved respite for Royal Marines and navy divers (hot food and accommodation). Whilst trying to erect a navigational radar reflector the team sent ashore, they wandered through a mine field (no injuries received). Some Commanding Officers of note include Julian Oswald and John Brigstocke.
