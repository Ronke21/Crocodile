<text>Hanken School of Economics (, also known as Hanken) is a business school in Finland with two campuses, Helsinki and Vaasa. Founded in 1909, it is the oldest business school in Finland, and one of the oldest in the Nordic countries. Its programmes are offered in both English and Swedish.

==History==
Hanken was established in Helsinki on 1 September 1909, making it one of the oldest business schools in northern Europe, opening a month after the Stockholm School of Economics. The statutory meeting for in Helsinki was held in December 1908, and only four months later the private community college under the name of statutes were approved. In 1927, the school was given its current name, . The school introduced a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics in 1928, with professorships being introduced in 1934. The first doctoral dissertation took place in 1944.

Hanken&#x27;s campus in Vaasa was established in 1980 aiming to develop business education in Osthrobotnia, a region with a large proportion of the Swedish-speaking population in Finland. In 2018, Hanken joined the Helsinki Graduate School of Economics. An initiative to bring together three Finnish universities – Aalto University, Hanken School of Economics, and the University of Helsinki.

<doc id="629468" wikidata="Q7569952" url="?curid=629468" title="Southern Gospel Music Association">
<text>The Southern Gospel Music Association (&quot;SGMA&quot;) is a non-profit corporation formed as an association of southern gospel music singers, songwriters, fans, and industry workers. Membership is acquired and maintained through payment of annual dues. The SGMA was formed in 1994, and states that its primary goal is &quot;to preserve, protect and promote Southern Gospel Music, its history and heritage&quot;.

The Southern Gospel Music Association operates the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame in Pigeon Forge, a popular Tennessee tourist town, and also hosts the Southern Gospel Music Awards. The Hall of Fame and Museum was opened at the Dollywood theme park in 1999.

Leadership of the SGMA is vested in a 23-member board of directors. The SGMA is responsible for the nomination, selection, and induction into the Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame.

==History==
The Gospel Music Association (GMA) was founded in 1964 to promote Gospel music. It was created as an extension of the National Quartet Convention, a convention devoted to Southern gospel that had been operating since 1956. Its founding board included Don Butler, Cecil and James Blackwood, Vestal Goodman, Charlie Lamb, Don Light, and J.D. Sumner, and its first president was Tennessee Ernie Ford. In its early years, it faced competition from the United States Gospel Music Association, a for-profit entity also focused on gospel music.

In the 1970s and 1980s, tension and conflict emerged between Southern gospel and the newer developments of Jesus music and Contemporary Christian music. Southern Gospel conservatives had been resistant to racial integration, and even as they were slowly becoming more receptive to integration, the new developments in Christian music resulted in Southern Gospel becoming increasingly marginalized by music consumers and losing influence in the GMA. Many Southern conservatives, including members of the GMA, also disapproved of rock music and felt that the newer styles of Gospel music being promoted by the GMA indicated that the organization was essentially moving into an alliance with the &quot;enemy&quot;. The Southern Gospel industry became disenchanted with the direction that the GMA was heading and a new organization, the Southern Gospel Music Association, was formed by Charles Waller. However, in 1985, this organization was absorbed by the GMA. A new, independent Southern Gospel Music Association was formed in 1995.

==Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame==
The Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame is a site operated in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, by the Southern Gospel Music Association, at the Biblical Times Dinner Theater. It was established in 1997. The Hall of Fame is composed of pioneers in the field of Southern gospel music; members are selected by the SGMA annually, and are honored by a descriptive plaque and portrait in the Hall itself. The Museum contains thousands of items of memorabilia and a gift shop. Items on display include a replica of the Blackwood Brothers first bus, interactive video and sound clips, and bronze plaques of Hall of Fame inductees. It has been estimated that over one million people visit the facility annually.

<doc id="629470" wikidata="Q2904709" url="?curid=629470" title="The Bismarck Tribune">
<text>The Bismarck Tribune is a daily newspaper in Bismarck, North Dakota. Owned by Lee Enterprises, it is the only daily newspaper for south-central and southwest North Dakota.

== History ==

Founded in 1873 by Clement A. Lounsberry, the &quot;Bismarck Tribune&quot; published its first issue on July 11, 1873. It has been known as the &quot;Bismarck Daily Tribune&quot; (1881–1916) and &quot;Bismarck Tri-Weekly Tribune&quot; (1875–1881).

=== Battle of the Little Bighorn ===
The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s first claim to fame came in 1876, when the three-year-old paper published the first reports of George Custer&#x27;s last stand at the Little Bighorn. Reporter Mark H. Kellogg accompanied Custer and his men and died during the battle. He is considered the first Associated Press correspondent to die in the line of duty.

=== Pulitzer Prize ===
In 1938, the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service after publishing a series of articles called &quot;Self-Help in the Dust Bowl.&quot;

<doc id="629472" wikidata="Q294528" url="?curid=629472" title="Rights of way in England and Wales">
<text>In England and Wales, excluding the 12 Inner London boroughs and the City of London, the right of way is a legally protected right of the public to pass and re-pass on specific paths. The law in England and Wales differs from Scots law in that rights of way exist only where they are so designated (or are able to be designated if not already), whereas in Scotland any route that meets certain conditions is defined as a right of way, and in addition, there is a general presumption of access to the countryside (&quot;right to roam&quot;). Private rights of way or easements also exist (see also Highways in England and Wales).

==Inner London==
Definitive maps of public rights of way have been compiled for all of England and Wales, as a result of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, except the 12 Inner London boroughs, which, along with the City of London, were not covered by the Act. Definitive maps exist for the Outer London boroughs.

==Rights of way outside Inner London==

Local highways authorities (usually county councils or unitary authorities) are required to maintain the definitive map of all public rights of way in their areas, which can be inspected at council offices. If a path is shown on the definitive map and no subsequent legal order (such as a stopping up order) exists then the right of way is conclusive in law. Just because a path is not shown on that map does not mean that it is not a public path, as the rights may not have been recorded the legal principle being &quot;once a highway, always a highway&quot;. The Countryside Agency estimated that over 10% of public paths were not yet listed on the definitive map. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides that paths that are not recorded on the definitive map by 2026 and that were in use prior to 1949 will automatically be deemed stopped up on 1 January 2026.

The highway right to use a right of way is restricted to passing and re-passing, associated activities, and the taking of &#x27;usual accompaniments&#x27;. Bedford Borough Council mentions that walkers may
* take a pram, pushchair or wheelchair, where possible
* take a dog as long as on a lead or under close control
* admire the view, stop for a rest, have a small picnic on the verge 
* take a short alternative route to get round an obstruction

Highways maintainable at public expense generally remain in the ownership of the landowner, but such highways are also vested in the local highway authority; vesting being a form or ownership so long as it remains a highway. Lord Jenkins, in an &#x27;obiter&#x27; statement (not a formal judgement) suggested that ownership might be from the surface of the route to the depth of &quot;two spits&quot;, or approximately two spade depths. Collins M.R. seems to have defined it better: &#x27;All the stratum of air above the surface and all the stratum of soil below the surface which in any reasonable sense can be required for the purposes of the street, as street&#x27;

==Public footpaths==

In England and Wales a &quot;public footpath&quot; is a path on which the public have a legally protected right to travel on foot. In some areas public footpaths form a dense network of short paths. It is probable that most footpaths in the countryside are hundreds of years old. The majority of footpaths are shown on Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 maps.

The right of access on a public footpath normally only extends to walking (there may be other unrecorded rights as well), so there is usually no right to cycle or ride a horse on a public footpath. However, it is not a criminal offence to do so unless there is a traffic order or bylaw in place specifically: it is a civil wrong to ride a bicycle or a horse on a public footpath, and action could be taken by the landowner for trespass or nuisance by the user.

==Public bridleways==
A &quot;public bridleway&quot; is a way over which the general public have the following, but normally (unless otherwise according to Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 s56(1)(b)) no other rights: 
*to travel on foot, and
*to travel on bicycle, and
*to travel on horseback or leading a horse, with or without a right to drive animals of any description along the way.

Note that although Section 30 of the Countryside Act 1968 permits the riding of bicycles on public bridleways, the act says that it &quot;shall not create any obligation to facilitate the use of the bridleway by cyclists&quot;. Thus, the right to cycle exists even though it may be difficult to exercise on occasion. Cyclists using a bridleway are obliged to give way to other users on foot or horseback.

Public bridleways are shown on Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 maps, but many public bridleways (as well as &quot;roads used as public paths&quot;, &quot;byways open to all traffic&quot; and &quot;restricted byways&quot;) were recorded as footpaths only, as a result of the burden of maintenance required by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, and so are now wrongly recorded on the definitive map. Definitive Map Modification Orders are needed to correct these errors.

==Byways open to all traffic==
A &quot;byway open to all traffic (or BOAT)&quot; is a highway over which the general public have a right to travel for vehicular and all other kinds of traffic, but which is used by the public mainly as footpaths and bridleways are used, per Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, section 15(9)(c), as amended by Road Traffic (Temporary Restrictions) Act 1991, Schedule 1.

After the 2006 Regulations to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, BOATs should now more properly be referred to simply as byways.

==Roads used as public paths==
A &quot;road used as public path (RUPP)&quot; was one of the three types of public right of way (along with footpaths and bridleways) introduced by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Countryside Act 1968 required all highway authorities to reclassify RUPPs in their area – occasionally as public footpaths but in practice generally as public bridleways – unless public vehicular rights were demonstrated to exist, in which case it would become a &#x27;byway open to all traffic&#x27;.

This process was slow as it involved research into historic usage and often public enquiries, and so was not completed by the time the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 was passed. This reclassified all remaining RUPPs as &#x27;restricted byways&#x27; on 2 May 2006.

==Restricted byways==
On 2 May 2006 the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 reclassified all remaining roads used as public paths as &quot;restricted byways&quot;. The public&#x27;s rights along a restricted byway are to travel:
*on foot
*on horseback or leading a horse
*by any vehicle (e.g. bicycles, horse-drawn carriages) other than mechanically propelled vehicles (e.g. motorbikes or cars) unless vehicular rights pre-existed; the act did not extinguish those rights.

==Permissive path ==
A permissive path, permitted path or concessionary path is a path (which could be for walkers, riders, cyclists, or any combination) whose use is allowed by the landowner. It would normally be a path that is not at the time on the definitive map of public rights of way, but that does not prevent it from already being a public path for any or all of those user categories mentioned. For instance it might be a historic route fallen into disuse or it might have been used for twenty years &#x27;as of right&#x27; by the public, in both cases being a public right of way which is not yet shown on the definitive map. Some permissive footpaths and bridleways are shown on 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 scale Ordnance Survey maps.

A permissive path is often closed on a specified calendar day each year (lawful only if it is not already a public right of way of some description), and clearly signed (e.g. signpost or waymark) as permissive. The act of so closing or signing it ensures that any future use of it does not count towards the 20 years&#x27; use &#x27;as of right&#x27; needed to establish its public status. These are precautions to prevent it becoming designated as a statutory right of way in relation to its permitted use.

==Right to roam==
Under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 the public also has a right to walk away from rights of way on designated &quot;access land&quot;. This right is in addition to rights of way, and does not extend to horse-riders or cyclists. Access land may be closed for up to 28 days per year, whereas rights of way must remain open at all times, except in exceptional circumstances with special permission of the local authority.

==Creation of new public rights of way==
A footpath, bridleway or restricted byway can be created by one of the following means.

=== Dedication ===
In England and Wales, a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway may be expressly dedicated by the owner as a public right of way. Furthermore, unchallenged use by the public, as of right, for at least 20 years, may give rise to a presumption of dedication under Section 31 of the Highways Act 1980. A presumption of dedication may arise under common law after any appropriate period of time, by way of a presumed deed that has been lost; known as the doctrine of &quot;modern lost grant&quot;. Paths created by express dedication since 1949 are &quot;not&quot; automatically maintainable at the public expense as a result of s.49 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.

=== Public path creation agreement ===
Section 25 of the Highways Act 1980 allows a local authority (that is, a district or county council, or a unitary authority) to enter into an agreement (known as a &#x27;public path creation agreement&#x27;) with a relevant landowner to create a footpath or bridleway over land in their area. The local authority has to consult any other local authority in whose area the path will be, but does not have to consult more widely. There is no provision for anyone else to be consulted or to object. The agreement must be advertised in the local paper, and the route is automatically maintainable at public expense.

=== Agreement between a parish council and landowner ===
Section 30 of the Highways Act 1980 allows a parish council (community council in Wales) to enter into an agreement with a relevant landowner to create a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway over land in their area or in an adjacent parish. The parish council is under no obligation to consult anyone: all they have to do is reach an agreement with the landowner. There is no provision for anyone else to be consulted or to object. The path is not automatically maintainable at the public expense.

=== Public path creation order ===
Section 26 of the Highways Act 1980 allows a local authority (that is, a district or county council, or a unitary authority) to make an order to create a footpath or bridleway over land in their area. If there are no objections, the local authority can confirm the order themselves, so bringing the path into effect. However, where objections have been made, the order will need to be considered by an inspector from the Planning Inspectorate. Depending on the number and nature of the objections, he may consider the order after an exchange of written representations between the authority and the objectors, after holding a hearing, or after a public local inquiry. People who would like to use the path should submit letters saying why they need the path.

=== Street works authority ===
Section 228 of the Highways Act 1980 is mainly used by the street works authority (county council or unitary authority) to declare a street to be a highway maintainable at public expense. The street works authority has to perform works on the route. Such street works need only be appropriate to the type of highway to which the notice relates. So for a potential bridleway, if the grass is cut, or a hedge cut back, this could constitute street works for the purpose of this section, so enabling it to be used. The authority then places s.228 &quot;Adoption of Streets&quot; notices at each end of the route. Only the owner of a street (or if more than one, the majority of the owners) has the power to object. If there is an objection, the street works authority can either discontinue, or it can go to a magistrates&#x27; court. A path created by this method will be maintainable at the public expense. Hampshire County Council has used this method for footpaths, and Essex County Council often uses it for new bridleways.

==Rights of way improvement plans==
Each highway authority in England and Wales (other than Transport for London, the City of London and Inner London boroughs) was required to produce a Rights of Way Improvement Plan under sections 60 to 62 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 within five years of the date on which Section 60 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act came into force; this deadline was 21 November 2007. Each highway authority is required to review their Rights of Way Improvement Plan at least every ten years.

<text>The Canadair CT-114 Tutor (company model CL-41) is a jet trainer that was designed and produced by Canadian aircraft manufacturer Canadair. It served as the standard jet trainer of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), and later Canadian Armed Forces, between the early 1960s and 2000.

Development commenced as a private venture by the company. On 13 January 1960, the prototype performed its maiden flight; a year and a half later, the Canadian Government placed a major order for the type. The RCAF would be the dominant user of the type, but a limited number were exported as well. Specifically, the CL-41G model, which was supplied to the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF), served as a ground-attack aircraft up until its withdrawal.

The Tutor served as the Canadian Armed Forces primary jet trainer from the 1960s up until 2000, at which point it was finally retired from this role, having been replaced by a combination of the newer British-built CT-155 Hawk and American-built CT-156 Harvard II. While the majority of Tutors have been retired, a small number are still being used by the RCAF’s Snowbirds aerobatics team.

==Development==
===Origins===
The beginnings of the CL-41 Tutor can be found in a decision by Canadian aircraft manufacturer Canadair to develop its own indigenous trainer aircraft as a private venture. The design was the product of the company’s in-house Preliminary Design department. By August 1957, the basic configuration of the design had been completed, which was of a turbojet-powered, low-wing aircraft, complete with a tricycle undercarriage and a side-by-side cockpit arrangement. From the onset of development, the aircraft was intended to be a purpose-built trainer for providing elementary jet flight training, as well as additional training up to an advanced level.

Early on, despite a lack of official backing for the endeavour from the Canadian Government, the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s (RCAF) Directorate of Training’s Jet Trainer Liaison Committee had closely engaged with Canadair; its involvement in the project had reportedly made a significant impact in the final design of the aircraft. Both the Canadian Government and Canadair committed financing towards the production of a pair of flight-capable prototypes, as well as multiple static airframes. This early manufacturing activity was performed in a secretive fashion at the company’s Plant 4 facility, which housed Canadair’s Missiles &amp; Systems division.

===Flight testing===
On 13 January 1960, the prototype performed its maiden flight, flown by project pilot Ian MacTavish. Originally, the first flight has been scheduled to take place in early 1959, but had been delayed due to issues relating to engine development. While the prototype was powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney JT12A-5 turbojet engine, this would be substituted for by a General Electric J85 powerplant for the subsequent production aircraft that followed. This change of engine had required no redesign as the fuselage had been developed to accommodate a wide range of engines without structural modification being necessary; in addition to the JT12A-5 and J85, the Armstrong-Siddeley Viper ASV11, the Continental Gabizo, the Rolls-Royce RB.108, and the Fairchild J83-R-1 had been studied during the early stages of design work.

During March 1960, an RCAF survey team performed a series of preliminary flight evaluations of the CL-41 prototype over the course of one week; prior to this, the team had evaluated various trainers from France, the United States, and the United Kingdom as well. According to aviation historian Bill Upton, those who flew the prototype universally praised the aircraft for its favourable handling and performance. The prototypes were subject to an extensive regime of tests, some of which falling outside the traditional scope of such activities.

==Design==
The CT-114 Tutor is a single-engine turbojet-powered trainer aircraft. It was purpose-designed for the training role, and possesses numerous favourable qualities, including a high level of reliability and favourable operating economics. It is capable of a wide performance range, possessing a top speed at altitude of 795 kmh (429 kt) and a diving speed of 885 kmh (478 kt) against a relatively low stalling speed of 71kt. The Tutor is furnished with manual flight controls, which incorporate spring tabs. It is intentionally aerodynamically stable in flight, a factor which traditionally has aided in the training of fresh pilots unfamiliar with the demands of flight.

The Tutor features a side-by-side cockpit. During standard operations, the observing instructor was seated on the right-hand side and the student pilot on the left. Normally, only the left-hand side featured full flight controls. However, following experiences with the Snowbirds display team, a number of aircraft were reconfigured with extra controls so that they would be flyable from either position. The cabin, which is fitted with a rear-hinged canopy over both crew members, can be pressurized to a differential of 3 psi (20 kPa), the equivalent to an altitude of about 2,000 m, for pilot comfort.

For aerial display purposes, the Tutor was readily capable of being fitted with a smoke generator, including a pair of under-fuselage pods to house the pressurized diesel fuel used; the use of red dye in the smoke was discontinued fairly quickly as it was found to be highly corrosive. Various other modifications would also be made to display aircraft; these could be routinely installed and uninstalled as airframes would regularly be exchanged between display and training flights.

==Operational history==
===Overview===

During September 1961, the Canadian government, having been impressed by the performance of the prototype and being keen to support local industry, placed a sizeable order for 190 examples of the production variant, referred to as the &quot;CL-41A&quot;, on behalf of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Upon its adoption, the aircraft received the Canadian unified aircraft designation of &quot;CT-114 Tutor&quot;. The majority of the type was stationed at CFB Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, in Western Canada; the Central Flying School at CFB Winnipeg, Manitoba, also made heavy use of the Tutor.

Serving as a primary trainer platform, the Tutor was used in this capacity for over thirty years. During 1976, the Canadian Armed Forces decided to have 113 of the remaining aircraft furnished with upgraded avionics and provisions for a pair of belly-mounted external fuel tanks. By 1998, it was reported that around 120 examples of the type were still in regular service with the Canadian Armed Forces. During 2000, the majority of Tutors were retired, the type having been succeeded as the RCAF&#x27;s principal training aircraft by a combination of the newer British-built CT-155 Hawk and American-built CT-156 Harvard II. Since then, it has continued to be used in limited numbers by the service for both experimental (by the Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment (AETE) at CFB Cold Lake, Alberta) and aerial display purposes. By 2019, there were 24 examples registered as in service with the RCAF.

===Aerobatics===

During 1967, a batch of ten Tutors were modified for use as a formation aerobatic aircraft by the RCAF (and later the unified Canadian Armed Forces) display team, the &quot;Golden Centennaires&quot; to celebrate Canada&#x27;s centennial year. At the end of the 1967 season, the display team was disbanded, thus its aircraft returned to routine training duties. In 1971, a new formation team was formed at 2CFFTS (Two Canadian Armed Forces Flying Training School) at CFB Moose Jaw, and once again adopted the type. The following year, the name &quot;Snowbirds&quot; was chosen for the team; during 1978, the team received squadron status as &quot;431 Air Demonstration Squadron&quot;.

Since its formation, the Snowbirds display team has regularly performed at air shows and special events, including the annual flypast on Canada Day over the capital city, Ottawa. According to journalist Guy Norris, a defining trait of their aerobatics is the physically-demanding formation flights performed, as well as locally-developed manoeuvres such as the ‘Big Goose’. Unlike most display teams, the Snowbirds do not have a support aircraft; all spares and useful material could be carried by the aircraft themselves in storage areas located in the nose or the wing root.

Those Tutors used by the Snowbirds feature several modifications distinguishing them from standard examples; these include a smoke generating system, a highly-recognisable paint scheme unique to the display team, and a highly-tuned engine for greater responsiveness during low-level flying. Reportedly, display pilots would deliberately fly their aircraft using an above-average level of nose-down trim so that pushing the stick down would become unnecessary. The Snowbirds&#x27; aircraft would regularly be cycled with standard training aircraft, allowing the team to operate airframes with comparatively low accumulated flight hours.

===Overseas and proposed uses===
Canadair also developed an armament training and light attack variant, designated &quot;CL-41G&quot;. This model was powered by an uprated engine and fitted with underwing hard points, the latter of which allowed for the carriage of various external stores, including up to 4,000 lb (1814 kg) of weapons and drop tanks. During March 1966, the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) ordered a batch of twenty (serials &quot;M-22-01&quot; to &quot;M22-11&quot;) examples of the CL-41G-5 &quot;Tebuan&quot; (which means &quot;Wasp&quot; in the Malay language) aircraft as counterinsurgency (COIN) aircraft. In 1967, the Tebuan entered service in Malaysia. The RMAF operated the type in excess of twenty years, the last Tebuan being withdrawn from service during June 1986, having been replaced by the Italian Aermacchi MB-339A. Following their retirement, the majority of the fleet was retained and placed into local storage for over a decade.

One other experimental variant was developed, designated &quot;CL-41R&quot;, which was fitted with the nose of an F-104 Starfighter, as a proposed electronic systems trainer for future RCAF CF-104 pilots. A single airframe (&quot;CF-LTX-X&quot;) was constructed to demonstrate the concept, however, the R model did not attract any orders and thus never went into production.As of August 2019, the airframe was awaiting restoration at the Reynolds-Alberta Museum.

==Surviving aircraft==

Although the CL-41 Tutor has been retired from active training, 26 Tutors continue to fly with the Canadian Armed Forces &quot;Snowbirds&quot; and the Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment at CFB Cold Lake or are in short-term storage.

As of August 2011, there were three CL-41Gs and one CT-114 on the U.S. civil registry, while none were so registered in Canada.

During 2001, a CL-41G was given to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, by actor John Travolta.

<text>Cued speech is a visual system of communication used with and among deaf or hard-of-hearing people. It is a phonemic-based system which makes traditionally spoken languages accessible by using a small number of handshapes, known as cues (representing consonants), in different locations near the mouth (representing vowels) to convey spoken language in a visual format. The National Cued Speech Association defines cued speech as &quot;a visual mode of communication that uses hand shapes and placements in combination with the mouth movements and speech to make the phonemes of spoken language look different from each other.&quot; It adds information about the phonology of the word that is not visible on the lips. This allows people with hearing or language difficulties to visually access the fundamental properties of language. It is now used with people with a variety of language, speech, communication, and learning needs. It is not a sign language such as American Sign Language (ASL), which is a separate language from English. Cued speech is considered a communication modality but can be used as a strategy to support auditory rehabilitation, speech articulation, and literacy development.

==History==
Cued speech was invented in 1966 by R. Orin Cornett at Gallaudet College, Washington, D.C. After discovering that children with prelingual and profound hearing impairments typically have poor reading comprehension, he developed the system with the aim of improving the reading abilities of such children through better comprehension of the phonemes of English. At the time, some were arguing that deaf children were earning these lower marks because they had to learn two different systems: American Sign Language (ASL) for person-to-person communication and English for reading and writing. As many sounds look identical on the lips (such as and ), the hand signals introduce a visual contrast in place of the formerly acoustic contrast. Cued Speech may also help people hearing incomplete or distorted sound—according to the National Cued Speech Association at cuedspeech.org, &quot;cochlear implants and Cued Speech are perfect partners&quot;.

Since cued speech is based on making sounds visible to the hearing impaired, it is not limited to use in English-speaking nations. Because of the demand for use in other languages/countries, by 1994 Cornett had adapted cueing to 25 other languages and dialects. Originally designed to represent American English, the system was adapted to French in 1977. , Cued speech has been adapted to approximately 60 languages and dialects, including six dialects of English. For tonal languages such as Thai, the tone is indicated by inclination and movement of the hand. For English, cued speech uses eight different hand shapes and four different positions around the mouth.

==Nature and use==
Though to a hearing person, cued speech may look similar to signing, it is not a sign language; nor is it a manually coded sign system for a spoken language. Rather, it is a manual modality of communication for representing any language at the phonological level (phonetics).

A manual cue in cued speech consists of two components: hand shape and hand position relative to the face. Hand shapes distinguish consonants and hand positions distinguish vowel. A hand shape and a hand position (a &quot;cue&quot;) together with the accompanying mouth shape, makes up a CV unit - a basic syllable.

Cuedspeech.org lists 64 different dialects to which CS has been adapted. Each language takes on CS by looking through the catalog of the language&#x27;s phonemes and distinguishing which phonemes appear similar when pronounced and thus need a hand sign to differentiate them.

==Literacy==
Cued speech is based on the hypothesis that if all the sounds in the spoken language looked clearly different from each other on the lips of the speaker, people with a hearing loss would learn a language in much the same way as a hearing person, but through vision rather than audition.

Literacy is the ability to read and write proficiently, which allows one to understand and communicate ideas so as to participate in a literate society.

Cued speech was designed to help eliminate the difficulties of English language acquisition and literacy development in children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Results of research show that accurate and consistent cueing with a child can help in the development of language, communication and literacy but its importance and use is debated. Studies address the issues behind literacy development, traditional deaf education, and how using cued speech affects the lives of deaf and HOH children.

Cued speech does indeed achieve its goal of distinguishing phonemes received by the learner, but there is some question of whether it is as helpful to expression as it is to reception. An article by Jacqueline Leybaert and Jesús Alegría discusses how children who are introduced to cued speech before the age of one are up-to-speed with their hearing peers on receptive vocabulary, though expressive vocabulary lags behind. The writers suggest additional and separate training to teach oral expression if such is desired, but more importantly this reflects the nature of cued speech; to adapt children who are deaf and hard-of-hearing to a hearing world, as such discontinuities of expression and reception are not as commonly found for children with a hearing loss who are learning sign language.

In her paper &quot;The Relationship Between Phonological Coding And Reading Achievement In Deaf Children: Is Cued Speech A Special Case?&quot; (1998), Ostrander notes, &quot;Research has consistently shown a link between lack of phonological awareness and reading disorders (Jenkins &amp; Bowen, 1994)&quot; and discusses the research basis for teaching cued speech as an aid to phonological awareness and literacy. Ostrander concludes that further research into these areas is needed and well justified.

The editor of the &quot;Cued Speech Journal&quot; (currently sought but not discovered) reports that &quot;Research indicating that Cued Speech does greatly improve the reception of spoken language by profoundly deaf children was reported in 1979 by Gaye Nicholls, and in 1982 by Nicholls and Ling.&quot;

In the book &quot;Choices in Deafness: A Parents&#x27; Guide to Communication Options&quot;, Sue Schwartz writes on how cued speech helps a deaf child recognize pronunciation. The child can learn how to pronounce words such as &quot;hors d&#x27;oeuvre&quot; or &quot;tamale&quot; or &quot;Hermione&quot; that have pronunciations different from how they are spelled. A child can learn about accents and dialects. In New York, coffee may be pronounced &quot;caw fee&quot;; in the South, the word friend (&quot;fray-end&quot;) can be a two-syllable word.

==Debate over cued speech vs. sign language==
The topic of deaf education has long been filled with controversy. Two strategies for teaching the deaf exist: an aural/oral approach and a manual approach. Those who use aural-oralism believe that children who are deaf or hard of hearing should be taught through the use of residual hearing, speech and speechreading. Those promoting a manual approach believe the deaf should be taught through the use of signed languages, such as American Sign Language (ASL).

Within the United States, proponents of cued speech often discuss the system as an alternative to ASL and similar sign languages, although others note that it can be learned in addition to such languages. For the ASL-using community, cued speech is a unique potential component for learning English as a second language. Within bilingual-bicultural models, cued speech does not borrow or invent signs from ASL, nor does CS attempt to change ASL syntax or grammar. Rather, CS provides an unambiguous model for language learning that leaves ASL intact.

==Languages==
Cued speech has been adapted to more than 50 languages and dialects. However, it is not clear in how many of them it is actually in use.

<text>Friederich Wilhelm Gustav Spörer (23 October 1822 – 7 July 1895) was a German astronomer.

He is noted for his studies of sunspots and sunspot cycles. In this regard he is often mentioned together with Edward Maunder. Spörer was the first to note a prolonged period of low sunspot activity from 1645 to 1715. This period is known as the Maunder Minimum.

Spörer was a contemporary of Richard Christopher Carrington, an English astronomer. Carrington is generally credited with discovering Spörer&#x27;s law, which governs the variation of sunspot latitudes during the course of a solar cycle. Spörer added to Carrington&#x27;s observations of sunspot drift and is sometimes credited with the discovery.

The Spörer minimum was a period of low sunspot activity from roughly 1420 to 1570.

==Life==

From 1833 to 1840 Spörer attended Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium in Berlin and afterwards studied mathematics and natural history at Berliner Universität until 1843. He gained his doctorate on 14. December 1843 with a work on a comet of 1723 – his supervisor being Johann Franz Encke.

From 1844 he worked at the New Berlin Observatory, whose first director was Encke. In 1885 he was awarded the Valz Prize from the French Academy of Sciences for his work on sunspots.

<text>Bircotes is an area in the civil parish of Harworth and Bircotes in the Bassetlaw district of Nottinghamshire, England on the border with South Yorkshire. The population of the civil parish was 7,948. The local school in the area is Serlby Park Academy. Bircotes was founded in the 1920s, with the discovery of coal during the First World War and the establishment of Harworth Colliery (which has since closed), to provide homes for miners. It was home to one of the last deep-mine pits in the UK.

<text>Denny Abbey is a former abbey near Waterbeach, about north of Cambridge in Cambridgeshire, England. It is now the Farmland Museum and Denny Abbey.

The monastery was inhabited by a succession of three different religious orders. The site is a scheduled ancient monument. The church and refectory buildings survive and are Grade I listed buildings. Also on the site is a barn built in the 17th century from stone taken from the abbey.

The site, on an ancient road between Cambridge and Ely, was settled by farmers as early as the Roman period. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that it was owned by Edith the Fair (also known as &quot;Swanneck&quot;), the consort of King Harold, in 1066. It was owned subsequently by the Breton lord, Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond. The place-name &quot;Denny&quot; is first attested in Templar records of 1176, where it appears as &quot;Daneya&quot; and &quot;Deneia&quot;. The name is thought to mean &quot;Danes&#x27; Island&quot;.

==Benedictine monastery==
A group of Benedictine monks, dependent upon Ely Abbey, moved here from their water-logged monastery at Elmeney (a vanished settlement about a mile to the northeast) in the 1150s, at the suggestion of Conan IV, Duke of Brittany. They built a church and monastery, called Denny Priory, which opened in 1159. The crossing and transepts are the only parts of the original abbey that remain today. In 1169 the monks returned to Ely and the site was transferred to the Knights Templar.

==Preceptory of the Knights Templars==
The Templars built a number of additions, including a large Norman-style arched doorway and a refectory. Denny became a hospital for sick members of the Order in the mid-13th century. By the end of that century, the Knights had lost their power, and in 1308 King Edward II had all the members of the Order arrested and imprisoned for alleged heresy, confiscating their property. Denny was then given to the Knights Hospitaller, who took no active interest in the property. In 1324 it was taken back by the Crown.

==House of Poor Clares==
 In 1327 King Edward III gave the Priory to a young widow, Marie de St Pol, Countess of Pembroke (1303-1377), known for her founding of Pembroke College, Cambridge. Countess Marie turned what had been the Abbey church into her lodgings. She had a new church built and gave the remainder of the priory to the Franciscan Poor Clares. This community of nuns moved from their flood-prone Waterbeach Abbey.

The priory was expanded in this period, with comfortable quarters for the Countess, who never entered the Poor Clares, and spartan accommodation for the nuns. The priory began to be called Denny Abbey during this period, despite the fact that the term &quot;abbey&quot; is never used by the nuns of that Order.

The Countess of Pembroke died in 1377 and was buried before the high altar of the nuns&#x27; church in Denny Abbey, but the precise location of her grave is now lost.

==Abbesses of Denny==
A list of the Abbesses of Denny:
*Katherine de Bolewyk, first abbess 1342, occurs 1351 
*Margaret, occurs 1361 
*Joan Colcestre, occurs 1379 
*Isabel Kendale, occurs 1391, 1404 
*Agnes Massingham, elected 1412 
*Agnes Bernard, occurs 1413
*Margery Milley, occurs 1419, 1430-1 
*Katherine Sybyle, occurs 1434, 1449
*Joan Keteryche, occurs 1459, 1462, died 1479
*Margaret Assheby, occurs 1480, 1487, 1493
*Elizabeth Throckmorton, occurs 1512, last abbess (who retired to live with her nephew George Throckmorton at Coughton Court in Warwickshire). She took with her when she left the wooden dole-gate of Denny Abbey, carved with her name, which can still be seen at Coughton Court.

==Secular use==

The abbey was closed in 1536, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and was once more taken over by the Crown. The last of the nuns had left within two years. The Abbess&#x27;s lodge, originally built for the Countess, was retained as a farmhouse, and the Refectory as a barn, but the nave was demolished. In 1628 the abbey passed into private ownership.

In 1663 the Abbey estate was modestly valued at £58.4s.4d, as listed in the will of a Richard Kettle. By 1686, Joseph Kettle of Denny Abbey, whose connection to Richard Kettle is unclear, had grown the value over twenty-fold, to £1,223.15s.0d. So it was perhaps Joseph who was responsible for the substantial late 17th-century changes to the farm buildings.

The barrister John George Witt was born at Denny Abbey in 1836. Pembroke College, Cambridge, which had also been founded by the Countess of Pembroke in 1347, bought the site in 1928.

==Public ownership and museum==
The abbey, nuns&#x27; refectory and surrounding land remained a farm until they were leased in 1947 to the Ministry of Works, which later transferred them to English Heritage.

 The abbey, partially restored in the 1960s, is open to the public alongside the Farmland Museum, who manage the abbey on behalf of English Heritage.

The Farmland Museum, which opened in 1997, has a shop, café and an education centre, running courses for local schools. Farm buildings including the 17th-century barn have been converted into displays of local history and farming, including a 1940s farm labourer&#x27;s cottage, a 1930s village shop, and displays on local crafts and skills. Many of the old farm tools and machinery came from a museum at nearby Haddenham which closed. It was at Haddenham where interviews were made in the 1970s with local farming people, recording their stories dating back to the beginning of the 20th century.

The whole site, known as The Farmland Museum and Denny Abbey, is open from April to October, and there are regular special event days.

Note: The spellings &#x27;Denny&#x27; and &#x27;Denney&#x27; appear with equal frequency in the historical literature. The latter spelling is no longer used locally, in modern times.

<doc id="629525" wikidata="Q1325264" url="?curid=629525" title="Skorpios">
<text>Skorpios or Scorpios (, ) is a private island in the Ionian Sea off the western coast of Greece and just to the east of the island of Lefkada. The 2011 census reported a population of five inhabitants. Administratively it is part of the municipality of Meganisi in Lefkada regional unit.

==Geography==
The island, spanning 83.2 hectares (roughly 205 acres), is irregularly shaped, with main axes about and . It is heavily forested from south to north and features over 200 varieties of trees imported to the once nearly barren island by Aristotle Onassis. There are some sandy beaches, most notably East Beach, which was created by Onassis, who brought sand from Salamis Island for this purpose. It is home to three residences, a helicopter landing pad and a boat quay. Onassis also built harbor facilities in the bay on the north side for his &quot;Christina O&quot; yacht. The island water originates on a mountain from a nearby island which is estimated to cost about 100 million euros.

==History==
Skorpios is primarily known as the private island of the late Greek shipping billionaire Aristotle Onassis. It was bought in 1963 and believed to have cost him the equivalent of about €11,000 of today&#x27;s money (2015). Numerous high profile parties were hosted during the time of Aristotle Onassis. Skorpios was also the site of his wedding to former United States First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy on October 20, 1968. In 1971, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was photographed nude by an Italian paparazzo on a Skorpios beach. Upon Onassis&#x27;s death the island was passed to his daughter Christina, and then in turn to her daughter Athina Onassis, the only surviving heir. Onassis, his son Alexander, and his daughter Christina are all buried on the island.

==Rybolovlev long term lease==
In April 2013, Ekaterina Rybolovleva, the 24-year-old daughter of Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev bought through her trust from Athina Onassis a group of companies for $153 million. The assets included a long term lease to Skorpios and its smaller islet, Sparti. Beginning in October 2018 and with a completion date of 2020, Rybolovleva began developing a luxury resort on Skorpios for a total investment estimated at €184 million. The island is a Natura 2000 protected area with no more than 5% of its area to be developed. The Greek government is yet to confirm the legality of the purchase. An investigation is underway, as Giannis Mihelakis (a New Democracy MP) raised the question in the Greek parliament. Specifically, Onassis stated in his will that the island would remain in the family as long as they could afford to cover its maintenance expenses. According to the will, if his descendants could not cover the expenses, the island would be donated either to the now defunct Olympic Airlines or to the state.

<text>Manton is a former pit village and suburb of south-east Worksop in north Nottinghamshire, England.

Manton&#x27;s main source of employment for 100 years was Manton Colliery sunk by the Wigan Coal and Iron Company in the late 19th century. The model village was constructed soon afterwards to accommodate the families of miners who came from many parts of the country to secure employment. The village had a school and clubhouse. Manton was separate from Worksop but became contiguous to the town when the council estates were built in the 1950s and 1960s.

The colliery was on the South Yorkshire coalfield and was part of the striking Yorkshire region of the National Union of Mineworkers, whereas most miners in the Nottinghamshire region worked through the strike. Two miners from Manton Colliery made headlines in 1984 by challenging the strike&#x27;s legitimacy under the NUM&#x27;s constitution, and winning a verdict that the strike was illegal. The miners at Manton had overwhelmingly voted against the strike, but police had advised that they could not guarantee the safety of working miners against pickets.

David Peace&#x27;s novel &quot;GB84&quot; refers to Manton, but mistakenly locates it in South Yorkshire.

<doc id="629528" wikidata="Q7573092" url="?curid=629528" title="Spangles (sweets)">
<text>Spangles was a brand of boiled sweets manufactured by Mars Ltd in the United Kingdom from 1950 to the early 1980s. They were sold in a paper packet with individual sweets originally unwrapped but later cellophane wrapped. They were distinguished by their shape which was a rounded square with a circular depression on each face.

==History==
When Spangles were introduced in 1950, sweets were still on ration, and the price of sweets had to be accompanied by tokens or points from one&#x27;s ration book, but Spangles required only one point instead of the two required for other sweets and chocolate. This bonus, accompanied by effective marketing, made Spangles even more popular. American actor William Boyd was chosen to front the advertising campaign as a character he made famous in numerous films, Hopalong Cassidy, along with the slogan &quot;Hoppy&#x27;s favourite sweet&quot;. Another slogan was &quot;The sweet way to go gay!&quot;

During the early 1970s Mars Ltd commissioned a redesign of the packaging using a ‘funky’ period appropriate bespoke typeface. The new typeface and packaging designs were created by Neville Uden.

Spangles were discontinued in 1984, and briefly reintroduced in 1995, including in Woolworths outlets in the UK, though only four varieties were available – tangerine, lime, blackcurrant and Old English. There are many nostalgic references to them from children who grew up with them. Spangles are associated with the post-war era and they, like Space Hoppers or the Raleigh Chopper, have become shorthand for lazy nostalgia for the time, as in the phrase &quot;Do you remember Spangles?&quot; In 2008, Spangles topped a poll of discontinued brands which British consumers would most like to see revived.

The Tunes brand was the last remaining relation of the Spangles brand, sharing the shape and wrapping of the original product, but it has also now been discontinued.

==Varieties==
The regular Spangles packet (labelled simply &quot;Spangles&quot;) contained a variety of translucent, fruit-flavoured sweets: strawberry, blackcurrant, orange, pineapple, lemon and lime, and cola. Originally the sweets were not individually wrapped, but later a waxed paper, and eventually a cellophane wrapper was used. The tube was striped, a bright orange-red colour alternating with silver. It bore the word &quot;Spangles&quot; in large letters. In the 1970s a distinctive, seventies-style font was used.

Over the production period many different single-flavour varieties were introduced including Acid Drop, Barley Sugar, Blackcurrant, Liquorice, Peppermint, Spearmint and Tangerine. A white mint Spangle, complete with hole, was produced as a competitor to the Polo mint.

===Old English Spangles===
The Old English Spangles packet contained &quot;traditional English&quot; flavours. The standard line-up was liquorice (black), mint humbug (brown), pear drop (orange/red), aniseed (green) and treacle (opaque mustard yellow), but other flavours appeared from time to time.

The sweets&#x27; individual wrappers were striped, distinguishing them from regular Spangles. The tube was black, white and purple, and designed for a more mature and sophisticated clientele than the regular variety.

===Mystery Spangles===
A 1964 marketing campaign involved a Mystery Flavour Contest in which packets of &#x27;Five Fruit Flavour&#x27; Spangles contained a flavour with question marks on the internal wrapper. Press adverisements invited consumers to guess the fruit blend flavour from a list of six possibilities to win a transistor radio. After the competition closed in September the flavour was revealed as Fruit Cocktail.

==In popular culture==
Spangles were mentioned in The Kinks&#x27; song &quot;Art Lover&quot;, from their 1981 album, &quot;Give the People What They Want&quot;. In 1977, the British novelty pop band Lieutenant Pigeon released an instrumental single titled &quot;Spangles&quot;. The Fall song &quot;It&#x27;s A Curse&quot; on their album &quot;The Infotainment Scan&quot;, also includes a reference to Spangles.

<text>Scrooby is a small village on the River Ryton in north Nottinghamshire, England, near Bawtry in South Yorkshire. At the time of the 2001 census it had a population of 329, in 2011 the count was 315 and by the 2021 census this had fallen further to 307 residents. Until 1766, it was on the Great North Road so became a stopping-off point for numerous important figures including Queen Elizabeth I and Cardinal Wolsey on their journeys. The latter stayed at the Manor House briefly, after his fall from favour.
In 958, King Edgar granted an estate including land at &quot;Scroppenþorpe&quot;, including an area now in the modern Scrooby, to Oscytel, Archbishop of York. The Manor House belonged to the Archbishops of York and so was sometimes referred to as a palace. (A nearby former farmhouse is still called Palace Farm.) At the end of the sixteenth century, the house was occupied by William Brewster, the Archbishop&#x27;s bailiff, who was also postmaster. His son, also named William, took that post in the 1590s after a job as an assistant to the Secretary of State under Queen Elizabeth I. 

The junior William had been schooled in Peterhouse, Cambridge University, at the same time as the infamous Welsh Protestant Separatist firebrand, John Penry. He had also worked for the English Ambassador to the Netherlands, a hotbed for exiled Separatists and Brownists, for 12 years prior to taking up the role of bailiff and postmaster at Scrooby.

Young William Brewster evidently became dissatisfied with the Anglican Church as it was developing at the time. It appears at least from the 1590s he had acquired Protestant or even Brownist beliefs, judging by his children&#x27;s names. The earlier Jonathan was joined by Fear, Love, Patience, and Wrestling Brewster. 

After being jailed for a short time due to hosting a Separatist church in the Manor, William Brewster attempted to leave Scrooby for the Netherlands in 1607. After an unsuccessful first attempt, Brewster succeeded in 1608. He eventually went to New England in 1620 on the Mayflower, as one of the people later called Pilgrim Fathers. The Manor House was demolished early in the 19th century, though the levelled area where it stood can still be made out, as can the twin sets of steps (now just grassy banks) that led down to the ornamental ponds. All that remain are a cottage (perhaps intended for a resident official and not open to the public, though it has commemorative plaques), a substantial brick dovecote and the fishponds. Notice boards direct visitors to the best places to view the historic sites which today are private property.

The parish church of St Wilfrid has an octagonal spire. Other buildings of interest are the remaining buildings on the site of the former manor house, the mill, the old vicarage, the village&#x27;s historic farmhouses, and the pinfold. The village stocks were sold to America, more than a hundred years ago.
Just north of Scrooby, the road that links the A638 and the A614 is called Gibbet Hill Lane. This lane is so named after a brutal crime that took place early in the morning of 3 July 1779 when John Spencer, who had been playing cards with Scrooby&#x27;s toll-bar keeper, William Yeadon, and his mother (then on a visit), returned to the tollhouse and killed both of them. The crime was enacted for the purposes of robbery, and Spencer gained re-admittance under a pretence that a drove of cattle wished to pass that way. Spencer was interrupted by travellers in the act of dragging one body across the road towards the River Ryton, and arrested shortly thereafter by a search party. He was executed following a trial at Nottingham Assizes, and his body afterwards hung in a gibbet cage on a slope south of the Ryton now denominated Gibbet Hill.

==Places of Worship==
St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church is a Grade II* listed Church of England parish church.

<doc id="629551" wikidata="Q1032234" url="?curid=629551" title="Canadian Northern Railway">
<text>The Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) was a historic Canadian transcontinental railway. At its 1923 merger into the Canadian National Railway , the CNoR owned a main line between Quebec City and Vancouver via Ottawa, Winnipeg, and Edmonton.

==Manitoba beginnings==
The network had its start in the independent branchlines that were being constructed in Manitoba in the 1880s and 1890s as a response to the monopoly exercised by Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Many such lines were built with the sponsorship of the provincial government, which sought to subsidize local competition to the federally subsidized CPR; however, significant competition was also provided by the encroaching Northern Pacific Railway (NPR) from the south.

Two branchline contractors, Sir William Mackenzie and Sir Donald Mann, took control of the bankrupt Lake Manitoba Railway and Canal Company in January, 1896. The partners expanded their enterprise, in 1897, by building further north into Manitoba&#x27;s Interlake district as well as east and west of Winnipeg. They also began building and buying lines south to connect with the U.S. border at Pembina, North Dakota, and east to Ontario.

==Connecting the Prairies to the Lakehead==

The Canadian Northern Railway was established, on January 13, 1899 and all railway companies owned by Mackenzie and Mann (primarily in Manitoba) were consolidated into the new entity. CNoR&#x27;s first step toward competing directly with CPR came at the start of the 20th century with the decision to build a line linking the Prairie Provinces with Lake Superior at the harbour in Port Arthur-Fort William (modern Thunder Bay, Ontario), which would permit the shipping of western grain to European markets as well as the transport of eastern Canadian goods to the West. This line incorporated an existing CNoR line to Lake of the Woods and two local Ontario railways, the Port Arthur, Duluth and Western Railway and the Ontario and Rainy River Railway, whose charters Mackenzie and Mann had acquired in 1897.

To reach Port Arthur, which became the lake terminus of the CNoR, the line extended south of Lake of the Woods into northern Minnesota before heading northeast through Rainy River District to the head of navigation on the Great Lakes. The Winnipeg-Port Arthur line was completed on December 30, 1901, with the last spike being driven just east of Atikokan station by Ontario&#x27;s Commissioner of Crown Lands, Elihu Davis.

Meanwhile, Mackenzie and Mann expanded their prairie branch line operations to feed the connection to Port Arthur. From a series of disconnected railways and charters, the network became 1,200 miles of profitable and continuous track that covered most of the prairies by 1902.

== Northern expansion ==
After receiving grants from the Province of Manitoba and the Dominion of Canada in the 1890s, Mackenzie and Mann began building lines further north in Manitoba, with the intention of eventually reaching Hudson Bay. Throughout the 1890s, they reached Swan River, and continued building north between the Porcupine Hills to the west and Lake Winnipegosis to the east.

In 1900, Mackenzie and Mann directed this northern line west into the Northwest Territories (later Saskatchewan), where it eventually terminated at E.R. Wood (later Erwood). This northwestern line mainly carried lumber and was extended to Melfort between 1903 and 1905.

In 1907, the Canadian Parliament pressured Mackenzie and Mann to continue building more rail towards Hudson Bay. In that year, they created a junction on the Erwood to Melfort line near the mouth of the Etoimami river, where Fort Red Deer River existed, and a line was extended north to The Pas. By 1910, the settlement at this junction was renamed Hudson Bay Junction, and the line was completed between the junction and The Pas.

The long section of rail between The Pas and Churchill was never completed by CNoR. However, after CNoR was acquired by CN, the line was completed in 1929. &quot;(see Hudson Bay Railway)&quot;

==Transcontinental==
Once elected in 1896, Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier was eager for a second transcontinental. However, an expansion of the non-CPR railways west of Alberta would be a mammoth questionable gamble for the operators. Adding an equally costly route to supplement the existing uneconomical CP track through Ontario seemed more ludicrous. At the time, the CNoR planned to advance no further west than Edmonton. In 1902, the GTR held talks with Laurier and agreed to build a transcontinental under the auspices of the GTPR for the western portion, with the eastern portion built by the government-owned NTR. The CNoR, which had a charter to build westward to the mouth of the Skeena River was alarmed, but in no hurry, because it believed the GTPR would choose one of the more northerly passes to cross the Canadian Rockies, leaving the Yellowhead Pass for the CNoR. Despite promptings, the GTP was unwilling to collaborate with the CNoR in any joint construction.

==Western Canada expansion==
In 1905, CNoR reached Edmonton, just as part of the old NWT had changed into the province of Alberta. The rail-line crossed the North Saskatchewan River at Fort Saskatchewan, coming into Edmonton from the northeast, following the present-day LRT track.

After a pause, the CNoR began construction west from Edmonton, and by summer 1907 had gone as far as Stony Plain. A stock market crash that year ceased construction. When construction was resumed in 1910, it was found that extending the Stony Plain line meant frequent crossings over the Grand Trunk Pacific line which had been laid in the meantime. Instead CNoR decided to leave Edmonton through St. Albert. (A bump on 124th Street near Stony Plain Road is remnant of the constructed but abandoned road-bed.)

CNoR&#x27;s terminus on the coast changed over time. Rather than competing with the GTPR in having a terminal at the mouth of the Skeena, the CNoR accepted BC government subsidies to switch to the Vancouver area. When the GTPR selected the Yellowhead route, CNoR protests created some delay but could not overturn he decision.

In 1911, CNoR workers started on a townsite named Port Mann on the Fraser River. This townsite would accommodate new car shops, and from there, rail-lines would extend to Vancouver and the Fraser River delta.
CNoR&#x27;s initial expansion in the 1890s and 1900s had been relatively frugal, largely by acquiring bankrupt companies or finishing failed construction projects. By the 1910s, significant expenses were accumulating. The CNoR started construction west of Edmonton in 1910, fully two years later than GTPR. The construction through the Rockies, which was expensive, largely paralleled the GTPR line of 1911, creating about 100 miles of duplication. However, the largest costs were from building on &quot;the wrong side&quot; of the Thompson and Fraser rivers in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. CPR already had trackage on the desirable banks, forcing the CNoR to blast tunnels and ledges out of these canyons.

The most infamous construction folly on the CNoR in British Columbia happened in 1913, when blasting for a passage for the railway at Hells Gate triggered an enormous landslide which partially blocked the narrow swift-flowing Fraser River. The resulting damage to Pacific salmon runs took decades to reverse by the governmental construction of fishways.

==Eastern Canada expansion==

Mackenzie and Mann began their first significant expansion outside of the prairies with the purchase of Great Lakes steamships, the (1906) into northern Quebec&#x27;s Saguenay region and the acquisition of branchlines in southwestern Nova Scotia (the Halifax and Southwestern Railway) and western Cape Breton Island (the Inverness and Richmond Railway). Other acquisitions were in southern Ontario and a connecting line was built from Toronto to Parry Sound.

In 1908, a line, which under later CN ownership was known as the Alderdale Subdivision, was built east from a connection at Capreol, Ontario, on the Toronto – Parry Sound line to Ottawa and on to Montreal. In 1910 a direct Toronto–Montreal line was built. In 1911, federal funding enabled construction of the line Montreal – Ottawa – Capreol – Port Arthur. In 1912, with GTR and CPR holding the ideal southern routes around Mount Royal to downtown Montreal, CNoR started building a double-tracked mainline north by excavating the Mount Royal Tunnel.

==Steamships==
In 1910 the company entered the trans-Atlantic liner business with the founding of the Canadian Northern Steamship Company. The subsidiary acquired two liners from the Egyptian Mail Steamship Company and operated them under its Royal Line brand. The pair of ships were renamed upon purchase—&quot;Cairo&quot; became and &quot;Heliopolis&quot; became &quot;Royal George&quot;—and refitted for travel on the North Atlantic. In Royal Line service, &quot;Royal Edward&quot; sailed from Avonmouth to Montreal in the summer months and to Halifax in the winter months. At the outbreak of World War I, &quot;Royal Edward&quot; and &quot;Royal George&quot; were both requisitioned for use as troopships.

On August 13, 1915, the German submarine &quot;UB-14&quot; sank &quot;Royal Edward&quot;, which was transporting troops from Avonmouth to Gallipoli.

&quot;Royal George&quot; was sold to Cunard in 1916, became an emigrant ship in Cherbourg by 1920 and scrapped in 1922 in Wilhelmshaven.

Plans for a trans-Pacific service were mothballed.

==Resort development==
In 1914, to develop a resort on Grand Beach, CNoR bought a homestead north of Winnipeg on the shores of Lake Winnipeg,

==Financial trouble and nationalization==
By 1914, with the company&#x27;s financial predicament threatening the solvency of its major financier, the Bank of Commerce, the CNoR appealed for government help. The last spike of the CNoR transcontinental railway was driven January 23, 1915, at Basque, British Columbia, with Montreal-Vancouver freight and passenger services commencing six months later, and providing a rail network in Nova Scotia, Southern Ontario, Minnesota, and on Vancouver Island. Between 1915 and 1918, CNoR tried desperately to increase profits, but CPR garnered the majority of wartime traffic. The company was also saddled with ongoing construction costs associated with the Mount Royal Tunnel project.

CNoR was heavily indebted to banks and governments, and its profitable branchlines in the prairie provinces — &quot;Canada&#x27;s breadbasket&quot; — would not generate enough revenue to cover construction costs in other areas. Unable to meet its debts, the company became desperate for financial aid. In 1917, the federal government effectively took control of the company. As a condition for further funding, the government became the majority shareholder. On September 6, 1918, the directors, Mackenzie and Mann, resigned, replaced by a government-appointed board. Subsequently, CNoR executive David Blyth Hanna and his team managed not only CNoR operations but also the federally owned Canadian Government Railways (CGR). On December 20, 1918, a Privy Council order directed CNoR and CGR to be managed under the name Canadian National Railway (CNR) as a means to simplify funding and operations, but CNoR and CGR would not formally merge and cease corporate existence until January 20, 1923, the date Parliament passed the final act to incorporate CNR.

Significant portions of the old CNoR system survive under CN (as the CNR has been known since 1960); for example:
* the Mount Royal Tunnel and suburban line to Deux-Montagnes, Quebec
* the line from Montreal (Pointe-aux-Trembles) northeast to Saguenay, Quebec
* the CN main line north and west from Toronto to Longlac, Ontario, about 900 km east of Winnipeg
* the CN main line from the Yellowhead Pass southwest to Vancouver.
The majority of CN&#x27;s former CNoR branchline network across Canada has either been abandoned or sold to shortline operators. An important U.S. subsidiary of CNoR, the Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway, forms part of a key CN connection between Chicago and Winnipeg.

<text>In integral geometry (otherwise called geometric probability theory), Hadwiger&#x27;s theorem characterises the valuations on convex bodies in formula_1 It was proved by Hugo Hadwiger.

== Introduction ==

=== Valuations ===

Let formula_2 be the collection of all compact convex sets in formula_1 A valuation is a function formula_4 such that formula_5 and for every formula_6 that satisfy formula_7
formula_8

A valuation is called continuous if it is continuous with respect to the Hausdorff metric. A valuation is called invariant under rigid motions if formula_9 whenever formula_10 and formula_11 is either a translation or a rotation of formula_1

=== Quermassintegrals ===
The quermassintegrals formula_13 are defined via Steiner&#x27;s formula
formula_14
where formula_15 is the Euclidean ball. For example, formula_16 is the volume, formula_17 is proportional to the surface measure, formula_18 is proportional to the mean width, and formula_19 is the constant formula_20

formula_21 is a valuation which is homogeneous of degree formula_22 that is,
formula_23

== Statement ==

Any continuous valuation formula_24 on formula_2 that is invariant under rigid motions can be represented as
formula_26

=== Corollary ===

Any continuous valuation formula_24 on formula_2 that is invariant under rigid motions and homogeneous of degree formula_29 is a multiple of formula_30

<text>Northampton Saints (officially Northampton Rugby Football Club) are a professional rugby union club from Northampton, England. They play in Premiership Rugby, England&#x27;s top division of rugby union.

They were formed in 1880 as &quot;Northampton St. James&quot;, which gave them the nickname &quot;Saints&quot; from the 1880s. The team play their home games at the 15,249 capacity Franklin&#x27;s Gardens, in the St. James area in the west of the town. Since the early 1900s, the team has played in black, green and gold colours.

At the conclusion of the 2023–24 Premiership Rugby season, Saints finished first, which entitled them to compete in the 2024–25 European Rugby Champions Cup. The current director of rugby is Phil Dowson, who was promoted to director of rugby in the summer of 2022.

To date, Saints have won seven major titles. They were European Champions in 2000, and English Champions in 2014 and 2024. They have also won the secondary European Rugby Challenge Cup twice, in 2009 and 2014, the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 2010, and the inaugural Premiership Rugby Cup in 2019. 

Finally, the Saints have won the Second Division title three times; in 1990, 1996 and 2008.

The Saints&#x27; biggest rivals are Leicester Tigers. The East Midlands Derby is one of the fiercest rivalries in English rugby union.

==History==
===Early years (1880-1945)===

====Establishment and development====

The club was established in 1880 under the original title of Northampton St. James by Rev Samuel Wathen Wigg, a local clergyman and curate of St. James Church who was a resident of the nearby village of Milton Malsor in the house known as &quot;Mortimers&quot;. This is how the club got its two nicknames of &quot;The Saints&quot; or &quot;Jimmies&quot;. Wigg Himself had played for around 18 months between 1878 and 1880, and rugby football had already been played on an informal basis in the town and the county for around 17 years at this point. His original concept was to promote &quot;order&quot; to his younger parish members by creating an &quot;improvement class&quot; for troubled local boys.

The first &quot;official&quot; game played is considered to be against a local team, called the Star, from Bailiff Street, just off the Northampton Racecourse. The early days saw games against teams from Northampton such as All Saints, St Michael&#x27;s, Scorpions, Northampton Rugby Club, the Wanderers, and, in contrast to Saints&#x27; working-class roots, the exclusive, predominantly upper-class Northampton Unity Football Club, who later offered to merge with Saints (though this was refused by the St James governing board).

It was not long before Northampton had one of the major rugby union teams in the country, by the 1896–97 season they only conceded 93 points and kept their opposition scoreless for 17 of the 22 games played that season. Twenty years after its establishment, the first Saints player, local farmer Harry Weston, was awarded an England cap. The club was also drawing crowds of around 10,000 for major games, especially those against Leicester by this point.

====Relationships with other clubs in town====

A minor disagreement occurred in 1897 as Saints looked to drop the &quot;St. James&quot; part of their name to become &quot;Northampton Football Club&quot;, as the recently formed association football club Northampton Town FC also wished to take on this name. In the end, after some negotiation from RFU chairman George Rowland Hill, the Cobblers were willing to cede the name to Saints.

Saints formed an early relationship with the Cricket Club, after donating all ticket proceedings from their 1897 game against Portsmouth RFC to the cricket club, they later followed this up with a similar gesture after a game against Bedford in 1899.

====Original All Blacks tour====
In 1905, Saints managed to secure a game against the Original All Blacks, losing 32–0. After a post-match meeting on 1 May 1905, a third, gold, stripe was added to the shirt to mark the occasion, despite the heavy defeat.

====Edgar Mobbs====

Eight years after Harry Weston&#x27;s first England cap, Edgar Mobbs made his debut. Edgar was a hero throughout the town, as well as in Bedford after representing them several times also. A victim of the RFU&#x27;s witch hunting post Great Schism was accused of &quot;professionalism&quot; in 1907 and tried by the RFU, alongside several other players, all of whom were acquitted. He was the first Northampton player to captain his country but is best remembered for his exploits in World War I. After initially being turned down as too old, Edgar raised his own &quot;Sportsman&#x27;s&quot; battalion otherwise known as &quot;Mobbs Own&quot;. Edgar was killed in battle, leading his battalion over the top by kicking a rugby ball into no man&#x27;s land on 29 July 1917 attacking a machine gun post and his body was never found. Thousannds turned out to see the unveiling of his monument on Market Square.

The club arranged the Mobbs Memorial Match as a tribute. It had been played every year since 1921 and the fixture took place between the Barbarians and East Midlands at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens until the Barbarians withdrew their support in 2008. The match was saved by the efforts of former Northampton player Bob Taylor and former Northampton chairman Keith Barwell, and since 2012 it has been played alternately at Bedford Blues&#x27; Goldington Road ground and Franklin&#x27;s Gardens, with the host club facing the British Army team. From 2024 the match will be played as a preseason game between Bedford and Northampton.

===Postwar Period===

In this period the Saints continued to grow, and they started to produce some of the best players in England, some of whom went on to captain their country. They were one of the driving forces in the English game for the next 60 years producing players such as Butterfield, Jeeps, Longland, White and Jacobs but hard times were ahead.

===Revolution===

The club failed to keep pace with movements within the game and top players were no longer attracted to the Gardens, where a &#x27;them and us&#x27; mentality had built up between the players and those in charge of the club. Some former players formed their own task force, which swept out the old brigade in the 1988 &#x27;Saints Revolution&#x27; and put a plan into action that would put the club back at the top of the English game.

===Return to Normality===

Barrie Corless, as director of rugby, set about restructuring the club and soon the Saints were back on the way up, helped by the signing of All Blacks legend Buck Shelford.

In 1990, Northampton Rugby Union Football Club gained promotion to the First Division and the following year made their first trip to Twickenham to play Quins in the Pilkington Cup Final. They lost in extra time but the foundations of a good Saints line-up were beginning to show in the following few seasons.

Tim Rodber and Ian Hunter forced their way into the England setup while younger players such as Paul Grayson, Matt Dawson and Nick Beal came through the ranks and would follow the duo into the England senior team.

In 1994, Ian McGeechan took over as director of rugby, and although the club were relegated in his first season, they returned in style the next season, winning every single game of their campaign and averaging 50 points a game. This season is referred to by many fans of the club as the &quot;Demolition Tour of Division Two&quot;.

===Professional era===
In 1995, rugby union turned professional and the club was taken over by local businessman Keith Barwell.

In 1999, Saints came runners-up in the Allied Dunbar Premiership, their league campaign climaxing with a crucial home local derby with eventual winners Leicester Tigers, which they lost 15–22. Ian McGeechan had left the club at the end of the previous season to return to coach Scotland, and was replaced by former Saints player John Steele who had done well on a limited budget at London Scottish. Steele relied on the foundations laid by McGeechan, as well as the inspirational captaincy of Samoan Pat Lam to lead the club to European success the following season.

In 1999–2000, the club became a Public Limited Company (Plc) and shares were issued to the public; in this season the Saints lost in the Tetley&#x27;s Bitter Cup Final to Wasps, but beat Munster 9–8 in the European Cup Final to win their first major trophy.

After a poor start to the 2001–2002 season, former All-Black coach Wayne Smith was appointed as head coach. He went on to transform the club in five short months. A team who looked down and out in November were moulded into a side that reached the Powergen Cup final and again qualified for the Heineken Cup. Travis Perkins became the club&#x27;s main sponsor in 2001.

In recent times the club narrowly survived relegation from the Premiership, after the coach (Alan Solomons) was sacked in the middle of the 2004–05 season. The coaching role was passed onto the former first teammates Budge Pountney and Paul Grayson to tide the team over. They had a slow start in the 2005–06 season, but continued to stay mainly unbeaten after the New Year. Budge retired at the start of the 2006–07 season leaving Grayson in overall control.

The Saints would again compete in the 2006–07 Heineken Cup. They finished second in their pool, behind Biarritz Olympique, the runners-up from the previous season. Northampton qualified for the quarter-finals and actually met Biarritz in Spain. Despite being in last place of the English league at the time, they defeated the French champions 7–6 to advance to the semi-finals.

===Relegation (2007–08)===
On 28 April 2007, despite a 27–22 victory over London Irish at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens, Northampton were relegated from the English Premiership. A &quot;behind the scenes restructure&quot; led to the brief appointment of Peter Sloane as head coach, from the role of forwards coach. Paul Grayson became the skills and backs coach. England Saxons coach Jim Mallinder became the new head coach and director of rugby, with his assistant Dorian West also following as assistant coach. Peter Sloane has since left the club.

On 22 March 2008, Northampton beat Exeter Chiefs to ensure their promotion and a return to the Guinness Premiership. On 12 April 2008, Northampton beat Exeter Chiefs 24–13 at Twickenham Stadium to win the EDF Energy Trophy. On 26 April 2008 they ended their National Division One season undefeated with 30 wins from 30 games.

===Return to Premiership (2008–2014)===
In the 2008–09 season, the Saints finished eighth on the table and only losing one game at home to Newcastle Falcons. They also lifted the European Challenge Cup, defeating French side Bourgoin 15–3 in the final on 22 May 2009 at The Stoop in London. The victory gave them a place in the 2009–10 Heineken Cup.

In March 2010, the Saints won the Anglo-Welsh Cup final against Gloucester 30–24, gaining them their fourth piece of silverware in three years, and a place in the following season&#x27;s Heineken Cup. They also finished second in the English Premiership, losing to Saracens 19–21 in the semi-final played at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens, and progressed as far as the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup losing to Munster at Thomond Park, Limerick.

Northampton finished fourth in the 2010–11 English Premiership, losing to Leicester in the semi-final. Saints also went undefeated into the final of the Heineken Cup, where they were beaten by Leinster 33–22, at the Millennium Stadium.

At the beginning of the 2011–12 season, with nine players out for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, Saints were knocked out of the 2011–12 Heineken Cup in Stadium MK by Munster. When the international players returned, Saints began to move up the table. England picked eight Saints players out of a squad of 32 to represent England, meaning that over a quarter of the England team were Saints – a new club record for the number of players selected for a single England squad. In 2011–12, the Saints reached a third successive Premiership semi-final and a second Anglo-Welsh Cup final in three seasons.

After winning their first five matches of 2012–13, the Saints were pulled back into the pack in the Premiership and exited both the Anglo-Welsh and Heineken Cups, despite ending Ulster&#x27;s four-year unbeaten home European record just before Christmas 2012. The team finished fourth in the league, and after beating Saracens in the semi-final reached their first ever Premiership final, where they lost 37–17 to Leicester.
The 2013 season finished with seven players being taken to Argentina as part of the England squad, including Tom Wood as captain.

In the 2013–14 season, the club finished second in the league behind Saracens with a total of 78 points. Despite finishing second in the table, they went on to win the 2013–14 English Premiership, defeating table-topping Saracens 24–20, after 100 minutes of rugby due to the game going to extra time. They also reached the final of the 2013–14 European Challenge Cup, which they won by beating Bath 16–30, with the match being played at Cardiff Arms Park in Wales.

===2014–2018===
Following the most arguably successful season in the club&#x27;s history, the Saints finished atop of the Rugby Premiership with 76 points. However, they were undone in the 2014–15 Premiership Rugby semi-finals, losing out 24–29 to Saracens on 23 May 2015.

After this, a couple disappointing seasons followed, with on-pitch results leading to a stagnation of the club overall, and on 12 December 2017, largely successful director of rugby Jim Mallinder was ultimately released from the club as a result after spending more than 10 years at the club. On 29 December 2017, Australian coach Alan Gaffney joined the club on an interim basis until the end of the 2017–18 Premiership Rugby campaign, who worked alongside Alan Dickens at the helm. The team finished 9th overall that year with a points tally of 43, but ultimately avoided relegation and confirmed their place in the 2018–19 Premiership Rugby season.

===2018–present===

A new era was confirmed at the club, when it was announced on 29 January 2018, that Hurricanes boss Chris Boyd would link up with the Saints for the 2018–19 Premiership Rugby campaign. The announcement of Boyd was a huge coup for the club, due to the coach&#x27;s high level profile, and success in Southern Hemisphere Rugby, which included the 2016 Super Rugby title with the Hurricanes. In Boyd&#x27;s first season at the club, the Northampton Saints would go on to lift the Premiership Rugby Cup, by defeating Saracens 23–9 in front of a home-final crowd, which took place on 17 March 2019. The Saints also secured a top 4 finish for the first time since 2015, and Boyd&#x27;s men would go on to face the Exeter Chiefs in the Premiership Rugby semi-final play-off system. In the 2023–24 season, Northampton Saints won the Gallagher Premiership in a match against Bath, finishing 25–21. This was their second league win, 10 years after their first win in 2014. A parade was organised for the following day and thousands of supporters attended. Roads were shut for this and a route was planned, which went from Franklin&#x27;s Gardens to the Northampton Guildhall.

==Stadium==
===Franklin&#x27;s Gardens===
====Stadium overview====

Northampton Saints have played at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens since 1880, when the club was founded. Franklin&#x27;s Gardens is a purpose-built rugby stadium to the west of the town centre, apart from the stadium, the club also has two training pitches, an indoor training centre, car parking facilities and a club shop (all see below). It is about 1,250 m from the railway station and about 2,000 m from the bus station. The stadium has a capacity of 15,249 spectators and 18,000 for concerts. The stadium also has 40 corporate boxes, each of which can hold from 8 to 24 people. The stadium is also a multi-functional conference centre as well as the only Gallagher Premiership ground with its own cenotaph, which is located on the north corner of the stadium under the main screen. All stands also contain wheelchair areas and wheelchair and disabled access is provided throughout.

Northampton Saints had an unbeaten home record that stretched from March 2007 to March 2009, much of this record was set during the Saints&#x27; 2007–08 promotion from the RFU Championship (previously National Division One). During the 2008–09 English Premiership regular season the Saints only lost at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens on one occasion, to the Newcastle Falcons.

In September 2021, Northampton Saints announced a six-year sponsorship deal with online car dealership cinch, which including naming rights to Franklin&#x27;s Gardens. The stadium immediately became cinch stadium at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens and cinch would become the club&#x27;s principal sponsor from 2022 to 2023 season.

====The Carlsberg Stand====

Until 2018, known as the Tetley&#x27;s Stand, this stand has the largest capacity of all those in the stadium, and sits on the eastern side of the ground, running along the length of the pitch. The stand was constructed in 2001–2002 and replaced the old east stand. In the stadium bowl, it features both a seated area as well as a terraced standing area. There are 14 executive boxes in this stand above the seated and standing areas. Underneath the stand on the ground floor, the Rodber bar can be found, which also doubles as a conference centre with a full capacity of 600. Also located on the ground floor, the Captain&#x27;s Bar and Heroes Restaurant function as a conference area and serves certain supporters on match days, they both have a capacity of 150. On the first floor there is also a Cocktail bar, called the 1880 Suite, which has a capacity of 50, as well as the Director&#x27;s Lounge, which also functions as a smaller conference centre and has a capacity of 120.

====Cinch Stand==== 

The Cinch Stand is located to the south of the ground and has the tallest seated area in the stadium, it runs along the width of the pitch. Originally known as the South Stand, it was constructed alongside the Tetley&#x27;s (now Carlsberg) Stand in 2001–2002. It replaced the old temporary South Stand, which had been up for some time by 2001. Construction was challenging due to the presence of a lake to the rear of the stand and initially much work had to be done to prevent subsidence. By 2005, plans were approved to increase the capacity of the stand and it was made several metres higher, adding around 1000 seats of capacity and 5 executive boxes, again the construction was influenced by the lake. Three stairwells (one for executive box use only) and seven entrance tunnels were added to allow easier access to the higher sections. Several bars were also added to the new concourse as well as additional toilet facilities. There is a gym located on the lower section of the stand though this is used less than the main gym in the Church&#x27;s stand. In 2010 it was named the Burrda Sport Stand, later becoming the Elite Insurance Stand in 2016 and finally the Cinch Stand in 2022.

====Church&#x27;s Stand====

The Church&#x27;s stand is located to the west and runs along the length of the pitch. It was constructed in 2001–2002, alongside the South and Tetley&#x27;s Stands. It is an all seated stand and is the only stand to not feature any executive boxes, likely due to design restrictions with it backing onto public land. Underneath the seating area, it contains the changing facilities for the home and away teams, as well as a gym and kit facilities. The Tunnel Club is also located here and functions as a viewing area for hospitality guests located inside the tunnel. The head coach&#x27;s seating area is also located at the top of the stand, and the benches for each team are located directly below.

====Barwell Stand====

The Barwell Stand was constructed in 2015 and replaced the Sturtridge Pavilion. It is an all seated area apart from the executive box section at the top. In 2009, the Saints&#x27; board announced they would be applying to increase capacity to 17,000 with the redevelopment of the North Stand. It was intended this would be funded by a £40 million investment by supermarket chain Asda, who would build a new store on the land used as training pitches. A political battle ensued with the local council, which later came to be seen as an attempt by the board to wrest public funding and public land for their commercial objectives. After the previous controversy, the club secured funding through alternate means – a loan thought to be in the region of £5million through Northampton Borough Council – and with planning permission rubber-stamped, building commenced in the summer of 2015. The Barwell Stand, which was named after the Barwell family, was completed for the start of the 2015–16 Premiership Rugby season, and took the capacity at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens up to 15,249. The stand also features the Members bar on the ground floor, which functions as a conference area on non-match days. Decorating the wall is an image of every single international player who has ever played for the club.

====Stadium Village====

The Stadium Village is located behind the Cinch Stand to the south. It features a number of bars and food stalls, as well as a large screen and a seating area next to the lake. Located here is also the Crooked Hooker bar, which can only be accessed by members and is one of the oldest structures still standing on the stadium grounds. There is also a marquee for conference events and club events. The Northampton Saints Foundation offices are also located in one corner of the village.

====Club Shop====

The Club Shop was acquired in the 1990s and was previously a nightclub/ bar. It is located to the north of the stadium and opens onto the main road (A4500). Sold here are replicas of all kits as well as accessories and other fashion items. The main ticket office is also located to the rear of the Shop.

====Northampton Saints High Performance Centre and training pitches====

In 2023 the club opened the Northampton Saints High Performance Centre, located on the opposite side of the Village to the stadium. This is designed to act as somewhere indoors to train and was partially driven by the distinct advantages that sports teams gain from having a training area that can be used at any given time, even in extreme weather. The pitch has an artificial grass. It was built on the previous main training pitch at the back of the stadium and features changing facilities as well as a half-sized pitch to train on. There are still two further outdoor training pitches that are also used for games by the youth players and second team, as well as for hosting youth rugby tournaments.

====Other facilities====

The stadium has six car parks, with enough space for 1,500 cars. The main car parks are located next to the outdoor training pitches and were constructed in 2005, they lie opposite the car parks used by the Football Club. The executive parking is located just outside the stadium next to the Carlsberg Stand.

===Mill Lane ground===

The club&#x27;s first home was located on Mill Lane, to the south of Franklin&#x27;s Gardens. Saints played games on this pitch from 1880 until their permanent move to Franklin&#x27;s Gardens in 1894.

===County Ground===

Northampton Saints also played a number of games at the County Ground in the early 1900s, as well as using the venue to host more important games such as the East Midlands vs All Blacks game in 1924.

===Stadium MK===

The club played a 2011 Heineken Cup quarter final match against Ulster at Stadium MK in Milton Keynes, because Franklin&#x27;s Gardens was too small to meet the minimum 15,000 seats demanded by the European Rugby Cup tournament organisers. The Saints won the match, beating Ulster 23–13, witnessed by a crowd of over 21,000. The Saints also played their semi-final there the same year, beating Perpignan 23–7. The Saints then hosted one Premiership
match a season at the stadium between 2014–15 and 2016–17. After this, it was deemed not commercially viable for the club to continue playing at the Stadium MK and up to now, no further games have taken place here.

==Kits==

In 2008, after being promoted from the championship to the premiership, Saints changed from Kooga to Rhino. After two years with Rhino, and coming second in the table, Saints switched again to Burrda Sport, a Swiss sports apparel company. Northampton signed a four-year deal with Burrda that have brought back the old-fashioned ring but with a modern twist for the home shirt and the away shirt with its black and gold ring with a peppermint light green background. In the 2014–15 season Burrda released a kit with horizontal green, black and gold stripes of the same size. It was one of the most popular kit releases of Saints History. Starting in the 2016–17 season Macron are Saints&#x27; kit supplier, signing a 10-year deal with the club.
For the 2021–2022 season the club released an away shirt with the names of the season-ticket holders that had donated their ticket to the club because of the coronavirus.

===Kit history===
====Notes====
:1.In Saints&#x27; 1999 away game against Grenoble, they were not permitted to play using Tetley&#x27;s as a sponsor due to French alcohol advertising laws, as a result they played using a standard home strip with the Tetley&#x27;s logos removed from the stomach and collar and instead replaced the stomach logo with a permissible &quot;Smoothly does it&quot; text piece (a slogan associated with the brewery).

===Current kit===
The kit is supplied by Macron. On the front of the shirt, Cinch is at the centre while GRS appears on the left and right of the collar. The shoe company Church&#x27;s appears on the left sleeve. On the right sleeve, the logo of the tournament varies between matches and below it is the Rugby Against Racism logo. On the back of the shirt, Cinch is located above the player name and number. Cinch is also at the top on the back match day shorts.

===Commemorative kits===

In 2001 a commemorative home shirt was produced with a &quot;Champions of Europe&quot; badge after the Saint&#x27;s victory against Munster in the final.

In 2021 Saints released a limited edition shirt to mark the 20th anniversary of their partnership with Travis Perkins.

==Club culture and identity==

===Colours and crest===

====Jersey origins====

Saints originally played in a scarlet kit, which was then changed to a black and green kit with no crest, with a simple cross being added at some time before 1884 (the same cross that now forms the basis of the new 2024 crest). This cross was removed from the shirts at some point between then and 1904 and the final, gold stripe was added that year after Saints played the Original All Blacks. These colours would form the design of every home kit since.

====Crest history====

Throughout the 1950s a new crest was designed and granted to the club by The Heraldry Society. This new crest was effectively a modified version of the coat of arms of Northampton. This new crest was used on all important documents as well as on jackets, training shirts and other pieces of formal wear, though was not included on a match shirt until 1984.

There were two minor changes to the crest that occurred in 1996 and 2016 respectively. Firstly in 1996 the text below the crest was changed to say &quot;Northampton Rugby Football Club&quot;, as opposed to the previous &quot;Northampton Football Club&quot; (which is still the legal name of the club to this day). Secondly in 2016 this text was further changed to say &quot;Northampton Saints&quot; instead.

A new crest was revealed on the 11th July 2024, with the original 1880 cross being placed in the centre of a similarly shaped shield. The change was considered controversial by some Saints fans, but supported by others.

====Away and cup jerseys====

Saints first away shirt came in 1990 and was white, green and gold, essentially a home shirt with the black replaced with white. To this day this is the most commonly used design format for the club&#x27;s away shirts, though many other designs have been used since. The following years saw this pattern repeated until 1996 when a mainly black kit with small gold and green stripes was used as an away shirt. in the 1999–2000 season, an away kit was rarely used and took the form of either a solid black or dark green shirt. The seasons following saw a return to the mainly black strip until 2005 when a white shirt with small green and gold stripes was used again, with this being repeated as the away design until 2012 when a sky blue shirt was used. The following year a neon green away shirt was used, with this design lasting two years and seeing usage in the Saints&#x27; first Premiership title win. An all grey strip was used in 2016 for the first time, with this design returning in 2019. In 2017 another neon green away strip was worn and 2018 a claret shirt was worn as a homage to the county&#x27;s colours. Finally the classic white returned for 2020 and 2023 and were interspersed by a grey kit in 2021 and a pink kit in 2022 respectively. For 2024 a light grey/ white shirt with no gold was used as an away strip.

Cup/third shirts have been used intermittently by the club, perhaps most famously the hastily designed cup shirt used in the 2002 Powergen Cup final against London Irish, after it became apparent that a kit clash would be inevitable with both the home or away jerseys, with the &quot;third&quot; shirt being a training kit. Third kits since then have varied in colours, with yellow, black, and red all being used from time to time.

===Rivalries===

Saints&#x27; main rivals are Leicester Tigers, whom they face in the East Midlands Derby. Over a number of recent years, the Saints have developed a rivalry with Saracens, largely due to the increased number of fixtures the two teams have performed against one another in, the most notable fixture being the 2013–14 Premiership Rugby Final, in which the Saints ran out victors. The rivalry with Saracens died down somewhat following Saracens&#x27; relegation after their Salary Cap Scandal and Saracens&#x27; subsequent relegation, but this rivalry has been rekindled somewhat since Saracens&#x27; re-admittance to the Premiership. Saints also had a mild rivalry with Wasps during their time in Coventry, but this second Midlands Derby was usually seen as less important to fans of the club.

===Songs and chants===
There are several songs tied to the club and chants are usually started in the terraced area of the Carlsberg Stand.

====Songs====

Saints&#x27; main club song is When the Saints Go Marching In, and is frequently sung by supporters. Unlike other sports teams that use this song, it is usually sung quicker by Saints fans, at around 140BPM, for its entire duration.

Another frequently used song amongst the crowd in recent years has been &quot;The Fields Are Green&quot;, a song that has had connotations with the town and more specifically the Football Club for decades. Dowson introduced the song to the Saints players in 2022 and since then the song that was already known by many supporters begun to be sung in the stands too. This formed part of a wider push for a stronger, more local identity amongst the players.

====Chants====

Chants of &quot;Come on you Saints&quot; and &quot;Jimmies&quot; (from Saint James) have been used for a long time by the club&#x27;s supporters, though the latter has fallen out of use somewhat over the last decade. More recently, alongside the singing of &quot;The Fields Are Green&quot;, the chants of &quot;Shoe Army&quot; can be heard amongst the crowds, a nickname of the football club that has also recently been adopted by the Saints and relates to the town&#x27;s shoemaking history. Supporters have also been seen removing their shoes during this chant.

===Identity among players===
There have been several pushes from different coaches throughout Saints&#x27; history for an identity amongst the players. Perhaps the most famous of these pushes was carried out by Wayne Smith, who not only ordered the purchase of the famous &quot;punishment car&quot; used in the 2003 season, a Reliant Rialto painted in the club&#x27;s colours, but also introduced the idea of having a &quot;player of the week&quot; shirt (an away shirt with a large Superman logo stitched onto the chest) as a reward for players for getting man of the match.

More recently, coach Phil Dowson has pushed for a new identity amongst the players, emphasising the club&#x27;s connection to Northampton and its history. Players have been encouraged to sing songs about the towns shoemaking history, and many of these cultural changes appear to be as a result of Dowson&#x27;s admiration for the playing culture of the football club.

===Other symbols of the club===
====The Stickman====

The Saints Stickman is a symbol of the club and has been used since at least the 1980s. The stickman has a halo and is often depicted carrying a rugby ball. Though the origins relating to how the club started using this character are unknown, the origins of the character lie in a series of books written and illustrated by Leslie Charteris. The club sells plenty of merchandise with the stickman&#x27;s likeness on, though the most popular and enduring of these products is a car decal and many vehicles can be seen driving around town with this symbol on the back as a subtle show of support to the team.

====Bernie====

Bernie, the club&#x27;s mascot, is an anthropomorphic Saint Bernard that can be frequently seen at home games. He has been a symbol of the club since at least 1999 and his design has remained the same since then, with only his shirt changing every season.

====Freight locomotive====

In 2015 it was announced that GB Railfreight 66754, a Class 66 mainline freight locomotive would be named &quot;Northampton Saints&quot; in honour of the previous year&#x27;s Premiership title. In doing so, Saints became the first rugby team to have a train named after themselves.

===Community===

====Participation and youth events====

Saints have been active in the local community for a number of years, with a large amount of this being carried out at the junior level. Players are often sent by the club to carry out junior training sessions in the twenty or so clubs within the county and the annual Saints training camp takes place at Stowe School every year. More recently there have been other locations used for smaller junior training camps, such as the training pitches at Franklins Gardens.

====The Northampton Saints Supporters Club====

The Supporters Club was officially founded in 1922 and has the primary objective of acting as an organisation to represent Saints fans and make their voices heard. In terms of secondary objectives, the Club aims to support all the local clubs in the area and to increase attendances both home and away. They frequently meet for social events and they organise coach travel to away games.

====The Northampton Saints Foundation====

The foundation has its roots in the organised educational actions undertaken by the club in the county, though the idea of supporting local young people was one of the main factors in the club&#x27;s creation in 1880. The foundation was formally created in 2018 and has provided many opportunities for young people since then. Most of this is centred around education about employability, life skills and interpersonal development.

The second pillar of the foundation is the preservation of history and they frequently carry out educational seminars about the club. The organisation is also responsible for researching the club&#x27;s history.

====The Parish====

The Parish is a community initiative set up by the club to support the local area by providing a number of benefits and exclusive offers to people who live within a certain distance of the ground.

====Local business relations====

Many businesses in the town centre can be seen sporting Saints flags and many bars and pubs in the town have pieces of Saints memorabilia scattered around. In 2024 the Northampton Saints Business Club was created, it aims to form good relations with local businesses to allow the local economy to grow.

==Club partnerships==

===Bedford Blues===
Saints announced that for the 2020–2021 Championship and Premiership seasons, they would make a number of players available for usage by Bedford Blues as part of a wider strategic partnership. Both clubs already had a close relationship due to several factors such as proximity, shared history, frequent friendly games already being played and similarities in business models.

The agreement also cemented an annual pre season game to be competed between the two clubs, as well as the exchanging of coaching staff between both teams.

===Loughborough Lightning===

In 2021, Saints announced a partnership with the Loughborough University Women&#x27;s Rugby Team who play in Premiership Women&#x27;s Rugby, the top women&#x27;s rugby competition in England. The agreement would see several Lightning games being played in Northampton, as well as the Northampton Saints badge appearing on their shirt. Furthermore, the team would be provided with a special kit in Saints colours for these games in Northampton.

<text>Saracens Rugby Club () are an English professional rugby union club based in North London, England, currently playing in Premiership Rugby, which is the highest level of competition in English rugby.

Established in 1876, the club has spent most of its existence in and around Southgate in the London Borough of Enfield. Since 2012, Saracens have played their home games at Copthall Stadium (currently known as StoneX Stadium for sponsorship reasons) in Hendon, in the borough of Barnet. Before this, they played at Vicarage Road in Watford for 15 years, the current home of Watford F.C. The club&#x27;s home kit playing colours are black and red. They are also affiliated with the Saracens Women&#x27;s team, which competes in the top tier Premiership Women&#x27;s Rugby competition.

Saracens have won 11 major trophies. They have been crowned European champions on three occasions – in 2016, 2017 and 2019. The club has also won the English Premiership six times – most recently in 2023 – and the domestic cup twice – in 1998, and 2015. In addition, they have won the RFU Championship, the second division title, three times – in 1989, 1995, and 2021.

==History==
===Origins===
Saracens were founded in 1876 by the Old Boys of the Philological School in Marylebone, London (later to become St Marylebone Grammar School). The club&#x27;s name is said to come from the &quot;endurance, enthusiasm, and perceived invincibility of Saladin&#x27;s desert warriors of the 12th century&quot;. The fact that their local rivals were called the &quot;Crusaders&quot; may also have been a factor. The Crescent and Star appearing in the club&#x27;s emblem are reminiscent of those appearing on the flag of Tunisia.

Saracens amalgamated with neighbouring club Crusaders two years later. In 1892, Saracens moved from Crown Lane, Southgate, to Firs Farm, Winchmore Hill. They then played on nine different grounds before the move to Bramley Road, Southgate, for the 1939–40 season (although the Second World War prevented them from playing there until 1945).

After their inaugural match against Blackheath, the Saracens had to wait another 9 years before Harlequins offered to include them on their fixture list. Saracens found it difficult to get games against first-class sides as the facilities at Bramley Road were so poor.

The club produced several internationals in the pre-league era, such as hooker John Steeds who won five caps representing England from 1949 to 1950; Vic Harding, a lock also for England from 1961 to 1962; and George Sherriff, an England back-rower from 1966 to 1967.

The club enjoyed fixtures with the leading clubs for many years and enjoyed a particularly successful time in the 1970s when they reached the semi-finals of the National Cup. Special games played at Bramley Road during this period include the 1971 match against a select International XV. The game was reportedly attended by a 5,000 strong crowd (the largest ever to watch a rugby union game in North London at the time). They came to watch a magnificent contest, ending Saracens 34 International XV 34.

This Saracens team also won the 1972 Middlesex Cup, beating Met Police in the final. Wasps were beaten in three Middlesex Cup finals in 1976, 1980, and 1986.

===The Courage leagues===
After some bleak years in the early 1980s, the club responded to the challenge of the Courage League, and with Floyd Steadman as captain and Tony Russ as coach, they won the second division in 1989 with a 100% record. The next year in the first division they surprised many by finishing fourth in the league behind Wasps, Gloucester, and Bath.

Within the space of two years, Saracens had lost Jason Leonard to Harlequins, Dean Ryan to Wasps, and Ben Clarke to Bath. Many proclaimed that they were quickly becoming a nursery for the more prestigious clubs. The 1992–93 season saw the leagues restructured. This caused Saracens and three other clubs to get relegated to the second division. In 1993–94 Saracens finished third and narrowly missed out on promotion but the following year they finished as champions and were again back in the top flight.

Former player David Wellman was given the task to re-brand Saracens. He gave former player Mike Smith the remit to take Saracens professional. A sponsor was required to improve the ground and playing staff. Saracens&#x27; seesaw existence over the nineties was about to continue in 1995–96 when they again found themselves at the wrong end of the table along with West Hartlepool but they were saved by their new CEO Mike Smith, who persuaded the RFU that there should be no relegation for the first season of professional rugby.

===The professional era===
====1996–2000====
In November 1995, Saracens gained the financial backing of Nigel Wray. This enabled the club to recruit the likes of Michael Lynagh, Philippe Sella, Francois Pienaar and Kyran Bracken. Saracens moved again to Enfield F.C.&#x27;s ground, Southbury Road, and they started the new season with a victory over title favourites Leicester. They only finished seventh, just missing out on Heineken Cup qualification.
The 1997–98 season was a landmark year. They began a ground share with Watford FC and their 22,000 all-seater Vicarage Road Stadium. The agreement ran until February 2013, when Saracens relocated to Barnet Copthall.

The appointment of Peter Deakin as Chief Executive saw Saracens splashed all over the broadsheets, tabloids, magazines and TV and with the help of a small band of fez-wearing followers that had been following the club for a number of years, &quot;the year of the Fez&quot; began.

Close season signings like Danny Grewcock, Roberto Grau, Gavin Johnson and Ryan Constable joined forces with the home grown talent of Tony Diprose, Richard Hill and Steve Ravenscroft to form a side that would prove a significant force during the season. This team lost only three games during the season to finish second in the Premiership, missing out narrowly to Newcastle, another club that had embraced the changes that the professional game had brought.

Consolation for missing out on the league title came in the then principal domestic cup competition, the Tetley Bitter Cup. Saracens beat Wasps by 48–18 in the cup final at Twickenham, in doing so equalling Bath&#x27;s cup final record score of 48 points. Their run had included a 59-point win over Blackheath, a 14–13 victory over Leicester, a quarter final 36–30 win over Richmond, followed by a victory over Northampton. It was the first major silverware that Saracens had won in their 122-year history. The game was also notable for being the last competitive game for two legends of the sport, Lynagh and Sella. Both of them were inducted into Saracens&#x27; Hall of Fame.

After a solid start to 1998–99 season, Saracens were rocked in December when they lost to third from bottom London Scottish in a shock defeat at home, but a win against Bedford and West Hartlepool and a draw with Wasps still saw them in touch with leaders Leicester. The second half of the season was a roller coaster ride with Saracens going from eighth and out of European contention after a run of four losses, to eventually finishing third as London&#x27;s top club.

The 1999–2000 season saw more big name players move to Vicarage Road, with Mark Mapletoft, Thierry Lacroix, Scott Murray and Dan Luger joining the club, along with Darragh O&#x27;Mahony and the up-and-coming Julian White. With the squad ravaged by World Cup duty and then injury the club&#x27;s first attempt at the Heineken Cup was not a happy one. They lost three games by a couple of points in the last seconds of the game and did not make the quarter finals.

With a few games left, they were looking at a possible failure to qualify for Europe again, but Kyran Bracken returned from a ten-month injury to inspire Saracens into fourth place and Heineken Cup qualification.

====2000–2006====
2000–01 saw another difficult start to the season. By October, Saracens had effectively crashed out of the Heineken Cup with back to back defeats to Cardiff, and with the team short of internationals due to the Autumn Tests, the final blow was dealt when Thomas Castaignède suffered an Achilles tendon injury.

The results went downhill fast, and a fifth-place finish saw the club miss out on a Heineken Cup place.

The 2001–02 season brought many changes, with established players such as Luger, Grewcock, White and, much to the consternation of his loyal fan club, Diprose, all leaving the club. Further weakened with the news that Castaignède was likely to miss the whole of the coming season, Francois Pienaar, now in full control of coaching operations, opted to make use of a crop of younger players coming through the club system.

After a reasonable start to the season, Saracens found themselves in their by-then accustomed top half of the table position. The curse of the Autumn Internationals once again took its toll, and Saracens&#x27; performances weakened drastically. Entering the New Year, Saracens were again flirting with relegation danger, and soon exited all cup competitions. With morale sinking, Pienaar stepped down from his various roles with the club after a five-year stay.

Lacking a coach, the senior players took charge, the morale problem seemed to have passed, but results remained sketchy, and the Saracens ended up in a lowly 10th place.

All Black legend Buck Shelford took over the coaching reins for the 2002–03 season, while the playing squad saw the arrival of the likes of Andy Goode, Christian Califano, and Craig Quinnell amongst several signings of established players. In a repetition of the pattern of some of the preceding seasons, Saracens once again got off to a flying start, beating Bath and Bristol.

Once again though, sound defeats, this season administered by London rivals, Wasps and London Irish, seemed to shatter the team&#x27;s confidence, to such an extent that once again by early in the new year, Saracens were once again uncomfortably close to the relegation zone, the only real success coming in an impressive run in the European Challenge Cup.

The club once again rallied towards the tail end of the season, with victories over Bristol, and then high flying Sale securing a 5th place in the table, that seemed unlikely at the turn of the year, and a place in the play off system for the remaining European Cup place. A comfortable win over fourth-place Leeds in the play off semi-final brought an astonishingly tight final against Leicester.

With temperatures soaring at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens, 80 minutes was not enough to separate the teams, with a late rally by Saracens tying the scores at 20–20. Ultimately, a Neil Back try was to see Leicester through, but at least it appeared that Saracens had rediscovered their fighting spirit.

The late rally was not enough to save Shelford, and he and most of the rest of the coaching staff paid the price for the weak season, being replaced by the experienced Australia and Leicester player, Rod Kafer, at that time a relative newcomer to a coaching roll, for the 2003–04 season. Key signings included Fijian Simon Raiwalui, former French captain Raphaël Ibañez, Springbok Cobus Visagie, and All Black Taine Randell.

The club&#x27;s finances were also diversified, with Nigel Wray divesting himself of nearly 50% of his shares to spread the financial cost and risk of supporting Saracens. This led to the addition of five new members being appointed to the Saracens&#x27; board.

The change of faces did little to change the pattern of consistent inconsistency of previous seasons. Once again, the early rounds saw a false dawn as Saracens found themselves in the top three, and again the club coped badly with the international call-ups for the 2003 World Cup, once again finding themselves near the foot of the table. Only the long gap to bottom place Rotherham avoided any serious relegation danger. The victorious return of Richard Hill and Kyran Bracken from World Cup duty brought somewhat more upbeat performances for the second half of the season, but it still took a rare away victory at London Irish to claim the same 10th place of two seasons before.

2004–05 saw a bold strengthening of the squad, for once eschewing their cosmopolitan recruitment policy and securing mainly English based players, possibly with one eye on the effect that international call-ups had had in previous seasons. In came Kevin Yates, Iain Fullarton, Alex Sanderson, Dan Scarbrough and Hugh Vyvyan, while Matt Cairns returned to the club and Steve Diamond arrived at the club as forwards coach. Another signing who was to become a prominent part of the Saracens&#x27; line up was fly half Glen Jackson from New Zealand.

The season got off to the best off all possible starts with Saracens scoring a victory over reigning champions Wasps at the first ever London &#x27;Double Header&#x27; at Twickenham. Once again, Saracens&#x27; winter malaise struck, and after inconsistent performances, Diamond took over the coaching duties from Kafer. The New Year brought a string of convincing performances, and a long unbeaten run saw the club finish the season in the top half of the table, in fifth place.

Once again in the wild card system for a European Cup place, Worcester were comfortably beaten, setting up the chance to end the season where it had begun, back at Twickenham. A late try secured victory over Gloucester and a place in the next season&#x27;s Heineken Cup was ensured.

There was further shuffling of the coaching pack in 2005–06 with Diamond becoming Director of Rugby and defensive coach Mike Ford taking over the front line coaching role. In a reversal of the previous season&#x27;s outcome Saracens lost their opening double-header game against Wasps, but unlike some previous seasons, this did not immediately trigger a run of bad results, and indeed until December Saracens progressed well. The Christmas season saw the start of a calamitous dip in form and going into the final months of the season the prospect of ending up in another relegation scrap seemed very real.

Diamond parted company with the club, with Ford taking over full control of the team, assisted by future England coach Eddie Jones in a consulting role. Results improved, and an away win at Sale who were to be champions that season even brought the prospect of another Heineken cup place.

A few disappointing results at the end of the season took some of the shine off the improved run of form, with Saracens ending the season in 10th place. The season&#x27;s end also brought to a close the distinguished playing career of Kyran Bracken.

====2006–07====
With Mike Ford being offered a role in the England set-up, former Leinster, Munster and Australia coach Alan Gaffney was appointed coach for the 2006 campaign. Among the new signings was South African, Neil de Kock, a player who was influential in the club&#x27;s best season since 2000. Once again, Saracens were narrowly defeated by Wasps in the London double-header.

This was to be followed by what turned out to be a good away draw at Bristol in the context of the excellent season that Bristol would go on to have, before a bonus point win was secured against the Newcastle Falcons. A morale-boosting run of results followed, losing only three times between October and the following March. No individual result could quite produce the reaction that the return of England&#x27;s Richard Hill to top flight action, with supporters of both clubs giving Hill a huge ovation on his return to the pitch after 18 months of knee reconstruction, capping off his comeback with a try.

This period also saw the long-awaited arrival of former Great Britain Rugby League captain, Andy Farrell, initially at flanker, but later at centre, the position at which he went on to take his England debut.

With the prospect of a place in the Premiership play-offs becoming ever more real, Saracens were also progressing well in the European Challenge Cup. They qualified for the knockout stages as second seeds, with only an away draw at Glasgow spoiling their group stage progression. A further win at the quarter-final stage against Glasgow saw Saracens host Bath for the semi-final, only to lose to ultimate runners up of the competition.

Results in the Premiership went Saracens&#x27; way, leaving them with the possibility of ending up anywhere from second to fifth as the final round of matches approached. After a day of games almost all of which had significant consequences in terms of positions at the top, and at the foot of the table, Saracens found themselves in the Premiership playoffs for the first time, squeezing Wasps into a rare 5th-place position, out of playoff contention.

The campaign was to end with a heavy defeat away at Gloucester, however, overall the season represented a significant advance on those of recent years. After the end of the season there was to be personal success for Glen Jackson, whose league topping 400 points for the season and consistent high-level performances almost every week saw him awarded the PRA Player of the Year Award by his fellow professionals. On a sadder note the mercurial Thomas Castaignède, one of the most enduringly popular players at the club decided to bring his club rugby career to an end after providing many years of entertaining rugby at its best both for Saracens and France.

====2007–08====

Preparation for the 2007–08 seasons saw somewhat less activity in comings and goings from the squad, reflecting the relatively solid 2006–07 season. Among signings to date, specialist cover for Glen Jackson came in the form of Scotland fly half Gordon Ross, while South African utility back Brent Russell was highly regarded by many Springbok fans.

The most spectacular signing though was that of All Black second row Chris Jack, widely regarded as the world&#x27;s best in his position, who joined Saracens after the 2007 World Cup. In addition to his all-round game, Saracens hoped that Jack would bring some solidity to a Saracens&#x27; line-out which was one of the areas where they were consistently pressured in the previous season. The estimated value of Jack&#x27;s contract raised eyebrows with a three-year contract at a total value of £750,000.

The loss of Glen Jackson and Brent Russell for the opening of the season due to pre-season injuries represented a significant blow to the club, but nonetheless the season began well with a return to winning ways against Wasps in the opening day London double-header. Defeat at the first home game by early pace setters Gloucester brought the team down to earth, before a solid away win at struggling Leeds, revenge for the previous season&#x27;s home and away defeats away at Worcester, and a win back at Vicarage Road over Leicester. Defensive frailties saw Saracens go into the Autumn Premiership break for cup matches third in the table, but also with the third worst defensive record, after a defeat away at Sale.

The first round of cup competition saw Saracens win comfortably away at Leeds in the EDF Energy Cup, despite conceding four tries. Another bonus point win over Bristol back at Vicarage Road positioned Saracens well with maximum points ahead of a difficult away trip to Llanelli. Turning to Europe, Saracens&#x27; return to Heineken Cup action also saw the return of Glasgow Warriors to Vicarage Road. As in the two European Challenge Cup home games against the same team in the previous season, Saracens ran out bonus point winners, albeit not without defensive frailties causing anxious moments going into the final minutes of the game. The following weekend Saracens lost out by a single point against Biarritz Olympique being denied by a penalty scored from the half-way line in the dying moments of the match.

The brief return to Guinness Premiership action at the end of November saw Saracens come out top in a tight battle at home against London Irish, with the lead changing hands several times. Cup action in the form of the final round of EDF Energy Cup pool stage games, where Saracens failed once again to win away in Wales, but taking a losing bonus point and a try bonus too was enough to see them qualify for the semi-final stage for the first time in their Anglo-Welsh cup history, ahead of their opponents Llanelli Scarlets. Further progress was then made in the Heineken Cup in an impressive ten try to one defeat of Viadana at home in a game which saw the first team debuts for Chris Jack and Brent Russell. Viadana almost took their revenge in the return fixture the following week, where Saracens conceded a 26–3 half time lead to the Italians, before showing composure in the second half to score 31 unanswered points and take the win that would see them enter the New Year at the head of their Heineken Cup pool.

The return to premiership action over Christmas and the New Year began well for Saracens with a win away at London rivals Harlequins, however once again defensive weakness and coming out of the blocks slowly saw Saracens take only a losing bonus point from their final fixture of 2007 in the Premiership, though it was enough to see them go into the New Year in third place in the domestic league.

The buildup to the first game of 2008 was dominated by talk away from the field of play, with the news that former Wallaby coach Eddie Jones was to succeed Alan Gaffney at the top of the coaching subject with Gaffney adopting the same consulting role Jones had been providing, while rumours of substantial cash investment from South African rugby interests abounded. When the focus returned to on-field matters Saracens suffered a second successive defeat in the Premiership, this time away at Bristol, failing even to take a losing bonus point for the first time in any competition in the season and raising fears of the all too familiar Saracens&#x27; winter slump.

====2009–10====
The arrival of Brendan Venter to the head coach role sparked major controversy. Shortly after arrival he triggered the culling of 18 players within 48 hours, known among fans as &quot;the night of the long knives&quot;, this would then be followed up by the arrival of a number of South Africans to the squad. This caused the club to be strongly criticised as they were seen to be swaying away from being an English club. Some even began calling the club &quot;Saffracens&quot;, due to their strong South African links (Saffa being slang for South African).

This didn&#x27;t stop Saracens going on a 10-match unbeaten run at the start of the domestic season which saw wins over London Irish (at Twickenham in the London Double Header), Northampton (at Wembley), London Wasps and Bath.

On 16 November a Derick Hougaard drop goal saw a one-point win over South Africa at Wembley. Viewed by some as a notable example of the South Africa excessive presence (Saracens fielded 9 South Africans), Saracens managed to overturn a 6–18 half time deficit to win 24–23. Generating greater publicity than the actual game was Stuart Tinner managing to win £250,000 by kicking a ball to directly hit the crossbar of the posts.

27 December saw Saracens lose away to London Irish, which was their first defeat of the domestic league competition, having had one draw and two losses in all competitions before this date. What followed was five defeats in the next six games; Leicester, Wasps, Bath and Leeds Carnegie all defeated Saracens, accompanied with being knocked out of the Amlin Challenge Cup despite losing only one match.

The post-Christmas slump in form for Saracens looked all too familiar. Yet a change in playing style and having found a new sense of attacking rugby, Sarries stopped the rot with a 58–15 drubbing of struggling Newcastle. From then on, they went on to win four out the five matches played, including impressive wins away to Sale, Northampton and table-topping Leicester Tigers.

This drastic change in form secured Saracens&#x27; Guinness Premiership Semi-Final spot in a respectable 3rd place and now faced Northampton Saints, the fifth time this season, away at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens looking to end a streak of six semi-final losses in all competitions in the last three-years. Saracens defeated Northampton 21–19 in an all-mighty clash, with Glen Jackson ensuring that Sarries reached their first final since 1998 with a late kick, converting Schalk Brits&#x27;s driving-maul try.

The 2010 Guinness Premiership Final at Twickenham, pitted Saracens against the eight-time and reigning English Champions, Leicester Tigers. In a pulsating game of rugby, Leicester sneaked Saracens to a 33–27 win with a late try to Dan Hipkiss providing the difference after Saracens flyhalf Glen Jackson had kicked what looked to be the winning penalty with only a few minutes left. Heartbreak for Sarries and their fans, but it just wasn&#x27;t to be a fairy-tale ending for a remarkable season.

The final also marked the last match for a number of players including Fabio Ongaro, Matías Agüero, former All Black Justin Marshall and loyal fly-half Glen Jackson.

====2010–11: Premiership champions====
Saracens opened the 2010–11 season with a loss to London Irish in the opener of the London Double Header at Twickenham, Following the loss, their form improved as they ran off four wins in succession before a shock loss to Premiership newcomers Exeter Chiefs. They crashed out of the Heineken Cup in the pool stage, finishing bottom of a tough pool that featured Leinster, the ultimate Heineken Cup winners, and Clermont and Racing Métro, both of which made the French semi-finals. Saracens&#x27; domestic form, however, proved much stronger; they secured a home semi-final with one league match left, defeating Harlequins on the final day to complete a run of ten straight victories, including away at Northampton, Wasps, Exeter and Leicester Tigers. In the regular season Saracens won more games than any other side −18 in total – only missing out on top spot in the league because of the bonus point system. Gloucester awaited the Men in Black in the Semi-Final at Vicarage Road. A nervy finish and a late penalty from young flyhalf Owen Farrell gave Sarries the 12–10 win they wanted to reach their second successive Premiership Final.

In the Final, they again faced Leicester Tigers in a dramatic encounter. Saracens dominated the first half, leading 16–9 at half-time thanks to a James Short try, and showed a strong defensive performance to keep out waves of Leicester attack. This culminated in a nine-minute period of extra time during which they defended over 30 phases of Leicester assault through the forwards while leading 22–18, finally being awarded a penalty to crown them English champions for the first time and get revenge against Leicester for the previous year&#x27;s final. Schalk Brits, who set up James Short&#x27;s try, was awarded Man of the Match.

Saracens also had one major off-field development during the season. Their landlord Watford FC activated a break clause in their groundshare deal, which at the time meant that Saracens needed a new home for the 2011–12 season. After looking at several venues in the area, Saracens announced on 10 November 2010 that it was in serious discussions with Barnet Borough Council about a move to the athletics stadium at the Barnet Copthall complex. Under the plan, Saracens would redevelop the stadium into a modern facility with 3,000 permanent seats and demountable stands to allow a rugby capacity of 10,000, and include the first artificial pitch in English rugby union.

Because of delays in the Barnet Copthall project, Saracens eventually reached an agreement with Watford to extend the groundshare at Vicarage Road for the 2011–12 season; the agreement covered at least 10 home matches that season.

====2014–15: Premiership champions====

Saracens started the 2014–15 with high-scoring victories against London rivals Wasps and Harlequins, and went on to finish the regular season in fourth place, qualifying for the play-offs. After beating first-placed Northampton 29–24 in the semi-final, Saracens met Bath in the final. Saracens scored three unanswered tries in the first half, and went on to win the game 28–16, becoming the first team to become Premiership champions from a fourth-place finish. They made it a double, with a 23–20 win against Exeter in the final of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, a last minute penalty from Ben Spencer claiming Saracen&#x27;s second Cup win.

In the first iteration of the European Rugby Champions Cup Saracens made it to the Semi-Finals before losing to ASM Clermont. In the boardroom, CEO Edward Griffiths departed and was replaced by Heath Harvey, a former director at Club Wembley.

====2019 relegation====
In March 2019, allegations first emerged that Saracens might have broken Premiership Rugby&#x27;s salary cap. Saracens chairman Nigel Wray had been investing in companies alongside players such as Richard Wigglesworth, Mako Vunipola, Billy Vunipola and Maro Itoje. In June, Premiership Rugby announced that they would hold an investigation into Saracens.

In November 2019, they were found to have been in breach of the salary cap regulations due to failure to disclose player payments in the 2016–17, 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, which would have taken them over the £7 million senior player salary cap. They were handed a 35-point deduction for the 2019–20 Premiership Rugby season and fined £5.3 million. The judgement found that Saracens had been reckless in entering into the arrangements with players without disclosing them to Premiership Rugby.

On 2 January 2020 Chairman Nigel Wray stood down and former chief executive officer Edward Griffiths returned to the role he left in 2015 with Mittesh Velani moving into a consultancy position. Wray was replaced as Saracens&#x27; Chairman by Neil Golding on 9 January 2020.

On 18 January 2020, Premiership Rugby announced that Saracens would be relegated to the RFU Championship for the 2020–21 season. Premiership Rugby CEO Darren Childs said this punishment was due to Saracens&#x27; lack of cooperation in a mid-season audit to prove compliance in the 2019–20 season.

After pressure from Premiership Rugby and the media Lord Dyson&#x27;s full report into Saracens&#x27; spending was published on 23 January 2020, it revealed the overspend was £1.1m in 2016–17, £98,000 in 2017–18 and £906,000 in 2018–19. These included £923,947.63 of property investments between Nigel Wray and three unnamed Saracens&#x27; players. It also included Saracens&#x27; claim that the Salary Cap was unenforceable under competition law; this defence was rejected.

On 28 January 2020, Griffiths resigned as CEO after less than a month in charge and Premiership Rugby applied a further 70-point deduction for the 2019–20 season to ensure Saracens would finish bottom of the league table.

==== 2020/21 Season ====
The 2020/21 rugby season was a successful one for Saracens, who won the RFU Championship and were promoted back to the Gallagher Premiership. The club finished the regular season top of the table, winning 10 of their 11 matches. They then defeated Ealing Trailfinders in the play-off final to secure promotion.

Saracens&#x27; success was built on a strong team performance. With a number of experienced players in their squad, including Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola. These players helped to provide leadership and direction, and they were also able to contribute to the team&#x27;s attacking and defensive play.

Saracens&#x27; success in the 2020/21 season was a major achievement. The club had been relegated from the Gallagher Premiership the previous season, but they bounced back in style. They showed that they are still one of the leading clubs in English rugby, and they will be looking to challenge for trophies in the Gallagher Premiership in the coming seasons.

Key moments from Saracens&#x27; 2020/21 season:
* Saracens&#x27; biggest win of the season was a 73–0 victory over Coventry. This was a dominant performance from the club, and it showed that they were a class apart from their opponents.
* Saracens&#x27; most important win of the season was their 117–15 victory over Ealing Trailfinders in the play-off final. This win secured promotion back to the Gallagher Premiership, and it was a major moment for the club.

==== 2021/22 Season ====
Saracens&#x27; 2021/22 season was a successful one, as they finished as runners-up in the Gallagher Premiership. The Men in Black were crowned champions of the RFU Championship the previous season. They quickly adapted to life back in the top flight, and were in contention for the title for most of the campaign.

Saracens&#x27; strength in depth was a major asset, as they were able to rotate their squad throughout the season without losing too much quality. They also had a number of world-class players at their disposal.

The Men in Black&#x27;s only major disappointment of the season was their defeat in the Premiership final to Leicester Tigers. However, they can take great pride in their overall performance, and they will be hoping to go one better next season.

Standout players:
* Maro Itoje was Saracens&#x27; player of the season. The England lock was in outstanding form throughout the campaign, and he was named in the Premiership Dream Team.
* Owen Farrell was another key player for Saracens. The England fly-half was at his best in the big games, and he scored 183 points in the regular season.
* Alex Goode was also a major contributor for Saracens. The England full-back was a constant threat in attack, and he also played a key role in defence.

== Stadium and training facilities ==

The current Saracens home ground is Barnet Copthall Stadium (currently known as the StoneX Stadium for sponsorship reasons) in Hendon, North London. The club has been based at the venue since January 2013, when it was then named Allianz Park. In partnership with National League 2 East club Old Albanians, Saracens currently operates its main training base at Woollams in St Albans.

Prior to the relocation to Barnet Copthall, Saracens spent 16 years at Vicarage Road, having maintained a groundshare agreement with professional football club Watford between 1997 and 2013. Before that, the club called Bramley Road its home for more than 50 years, through to the advent of professionalism.

=== Showpiece fixtures ===

Between 2004 and 2017, Saracens played select home matches at Twickenham Stadium, as part of the London Double Header, a marquee occasion held during the autumn of each Premiership season, involving London-based clubs. In addition, the club has hosted its own annual showpiece fixture – formerly branded as &#x27;Derby Day&#x27; and now known as &#x27;The Showdown&#x27; – at large high-capacity stadiums since 2009. To date, this game has taken place at Wembley Stadium, London Stadium and, currently, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

=== International relations and overseas matches ===
In the summer of 2013, Saracens played two international matches. They beat the South African Barbarians on 16 May at Artillery Ground. They toured the Atlantic Ocean island Bermuda to promote rugby. They visited a number of schools, ran coaching workshops and engaged in fundraising activities while on tour. To finish, they played a Bermuda International Select XV, which included Simon Taylor, Mike Scholz, Zach Pangelinan, Shaun Perry and Gcobani Bobo who are all internationally capped. The side was coached by former England international Lewis Moody and captained by former Ireland player Geordan Murphy.

On 12 March 2016, Saracens&#x27; away Premiership match against London Irish was held at the Red Bull Arena in the U.S. state of New Jersey. This was the first time a Premiership match had taken place overseas. Saracens won by a score of 26–16. The club then returned to the United States when they were hosted by the Newcastle Falcons on 16 September 2017, at the Talen Energy Stadium in Philadelphia. Saracens won by a score of 29–7.

== Playing kit ==
The Saracens playing kit is currently supplied by British sportswear manufacturer Castore, as of the beginning of the 2021–22 season. The club&#x27;s principal partner and primary shirt sponsor is American financial services company StoneX. The replica kit featured the logo of the Saracens Foundation, a charity operated by the club and £5 of proceeds from each jersey are donated to the foundation.

<text>Wasps Rugby Football Club was a professional rugby union team. They last played in Premiership Rugby, the top division of English rugby, until being suspended on 12 October 2022. On 17 October 2022, the club entered administration, resulting in relegation from the league and all staff being made redundant. They exited administration on 16 December 2022.

Founded in 1867 as Wasps Football Club, from 1923 to 1996 they were based at Repton Avenue in Sudbury, London. From 1996 to 2002 the team played at Loftus Road in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London and from 2002 to 2014 they played at Adams Park in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. From 2014 to 2022 their home ground was the Coventry Building Society Arena (known until 2021 as the Ricoh Arena) in Coventry. They have not yet announced a permanent playing ground following their exit from administration.

Wasps won 12 major titles. They were European Champions twice, in 2004 and 2007; won six English Championships including three in a row from 2003 to 2005; and won three Anglo-Welsh Cups. They also won the 2003 European Rugby Challenge Cup. Wasps most recent trophy was the 2007–08 Premiership.

In 2021–22 Premiership Rugby, their last completed season, Wasps finished 9th. Lee Blackett was appointed head coach in February 2020, until being made redundant.

In October 2023, the owners of the club announced plans to revive the team in a permanent home in Kent, while maintaining the possibility of playing from Sixways Stadium in Worcester pending completion of any new build. The club stated that it hoped to be involved in the pending relaunch of the professional game in England from 2025.

==History==

===Wasps FC: 1866–1995===
Hampstead Football Club was founded in 1866. A split in the membership resulted in the formation of two different clubs: Harlequin F.C. and Wasps. Wasps Football Club was itself formed in 1867 at the now defunct Eton and Middlesex Tavern in North London; names of insects, birds and other animals were considered fashionable in the Victorian period. In December 1870, Edwin Ash, Secretary of Richmond Football Club published a letter in the papers which said, &quot;Those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others, which makes the game difficult to play.&quot;

As a reasonably well-established club, the Wasps were eligible to be founder members of the Rugby Football Union (RFU). On 26 January 1871 the meeting was scheduled to take place. However a mix-up led to them sending their representative to the wrong venue at the wrong time on the wrong day. Another version of the story was that he went to a pub of the same name and after consuming a number of drinks was too drunk to make it to the correct address after he realised his mistake. Wasps were, therefore, not present at the inauguration ceremony and thus forfeited their right to be called foundation members.

Wasps&#x27; first home was in Finchley Road, North London. Later, grounds were rented in various parts of London until in 1923 the Wasps found a permanent home at Sudbury, Middlesex, eventually buying the ground outright. The side had somewhat of a renaissance during the 1930s; in the earlier part of the decade they were seen as one of the better English clubs, going unbeaten in the 1930/31 English season. The 1930s also saw the emergence of Neville Compton, who captained the side between 1939 and 1947 and went on to become fixture secretary in 1959 and eventually became the club president in the early 1970s before retiring in 1988.

Wasps went on to host Welsh internationals Vivian Jenkins and Harry Bowcott, in addition to this national representation, numerous Wasps came to play for the England national side, such as Ted Woodward, Bob Stirling, Richard Sharp and Don Rutherford. In 1967, the Wasps club celebrated their centenary. Celebrations took the form of two matches that were held at the Rugby school grounds, where William Webb Ellis is thought to have originated the rugby union game. One match was played against the Barbarian F.C., the other, against another London rugby union club, the Harlequins.

In 1986, Wasps Football Club made their first appearance at the final of the John Player Cup knock-out competition, which originated in 1972. Wasps were defeated by Bath in a close game, where Bath emerged as winners, 25 points to 17. The following year Wasps continued their success in the knock-out competition and they again met Bath in the final. They were however again defeated by Bath in a close game, Bath winning 19 points to 12. Wasp Rob Andrew captained England against Romania in 1989. In 1990, Andrew captained Wasps to their first Courage League title, as they narrowly pipped Orrell R.U.F.C. to be English champions.

In 1995 Wasps lost 16–36 to Bath in the final of the Pilkington Cup. It was their first appearance in the final since 1987 and 1986, when their opponents – and the eventual winners – on both occasions were also Bath.

After winning the title, Wasps regularly finished in the top three of the Courage league title, although they were never quite good enough to overcome Bath, the pre-eminent club of the time. Then in 1995–96, with many pundits predicting Wasps could make a run for the title, Rob Andrew took up a lucrative deal to become Player Manager of Newcastle Falcons. He recruited several other leading Wasps, including, most notably, Club Captain Dean Ryan. For a few weeks Wasps looked like becoming the first casualty of the professional era as the backbone of their team had left. But under newly appointed captain Lawrence Dallaglio, the club steadied the ship, and managed to finish fourth, and secure a place in the following season&#x27;s Heineken Cup, which English teams were entering for the first time.

===Wasps RFC: 1996–1999===
The following season, 1996–97, Wasps won their second league championship, and became the first English Champions of the new professional era. It was an equally momentous season off the field. The club split into two parts, with the professional side becoming part of Loftus Road Holdings PLC, who also owned Queens Park Rangers F.C. One element of the deal saw Wasps move from their traditional Sudbury home to share QPR&#x27;s Loftus Road stadium.

In 1998, the now-professional Wasps again reached the final of the Tetley&#x27;s Bitter Cup, but lost 18–48 to a strong Saracens side. The following year Wasps again reached the final, they defeated Newcastle Falcons 29–19 to claim their first cup final win. In 2000 Wasps reached the final for the third consecutive year, successfully defending their title in a 31–23 victory over Northampton Saints.

===London Wasps: 1999–2014===
In the summer of 1999, the professional team – which had been operating as Wasps RFC (professional) since the 1996–97 season – was renamed as London Wasps, to differentiate it from Wasps FC, the amateur side of the club. At the same time they adopted a new logo, which was selected as being in keeping with the club&#x27;s history. 

In 2001 ex-Wigan rugby league star Shaun Edwards joined as a coach. He has largely been credited with creating Wasps&#x27; famous Blitz Defence that stops teams and is the basis for Wasps&#x27; own scoring chances. London Wasps agreed to move out of Loftus Road to allow Fulham F.C. to groundshare for two seasons between 2002 and 2004, while their ground, Craven Cottage, was redeveloped. They became tenants to Wycombe Wanderers F.C. at Adams Park at the end of the 2001–02 season. The success of Wasps at their new ground meant they did not return to Loftus Road after Fulham left.

In the 2002–03 European Challenge Cup, Wasps made their way to the final, where they met Bath. Though Bath beat them in numerous finals in the 1990s, Wasps emerged as champions, winning 48–30 at the Madejski Stadium. They also defeated Northampton Saints in the Premiership semi-final, after finishing second in the league table. They then faced Gloucester in the final at Twickenham, to win in their first English title since 1997, by 39 points to 3.

Wasps finished top of their pool in the 2003–04 Heineken Cup, where they went on to defeat Gloucester at the quarter-finals and won a final berth after beating Munster 37–32 in the semi-finals. They met Toulouse in the final at Twickenham, where they became champions, defeating the French side 27–20, winning their first Heineken Cup. Wasps followed up the win the following week, again at Twickenham, by beating Bath to retain the title of England&#x27;s champion side, and complete a double.

In December 2004 the RFU revealed that the team was to be disqualified from the Powergen Cup for fielding an ineligible player, hooker Jonny Barrett, in a sixth-round game against Bristol. Wasps went through the season well, after the cup glitch, and retained the English title for a second time, by beating Leicester Tigers in the final at Twickenham. Edwards, however, was not a totally happy man as Wasps conceded their first try of the three Premiership finals in the dying minutes. Warren Gatland signed off at Wasps with a rare smile to continue his coaching with Waikato in New Zealand.

Ian McGeechan became the new Director of Rugby at Wasps from the 2005–06 season, taking over from Gatland. Wasps won the Powergen Anglo-Welsh Cup in the 2005–06 season, beating Llanelli Scarlets in the final at Twickenham. Before the 2006–07 season began, Wasps won the Middlesex 7s in Twickenham, beating Leicester Tigers in the final. 

In England&#x27;s game against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in the 2007 Six Nations Championship, Wasps supplied the back row of the scrum, James Haskell, Joe Worsley and Tom Rees all made an appearance. This was the first time that any club supplied the entire back row. Unfortunately for England, Wales won the encounter 27 to 18.
In the 2006–07 Heineken Cup, Wasps qualified by topping their group for a home quarter-final. They were drawn against Leinster on 31 March. There was a full house at Adams Park, and three players in total were sent to the sin bin, Lawrence Dallaglio in the last moments of the first half, Dominic Waldouck of London Wasps and Malcolm O&#x27;Kelly of Leinster later spent time there as well. The final score was 35–13 to wasps. In the semi-final at Coventry City&#x27;s Ricoh Arena on 22 April, Wasps beat Northampton 30–13 and in doing so, gained a place in the Heineken Cup Final against Leicester Tigers at Twickenham.

Leicester Tigers were the favourites, as they had already won the Anglo-Welsh cup and the Guinness Premiership, the latter just the week before. Wasps went ahead early, and while Leicester kept in the match, Wasps won 25–9, thanks to penalties by Alex King and tries by Raphaël Ibañez and Eoin Reddan to become 2007 champions.

During the 2007–08 season, Wasps went from 10th in the league during October, to beat Leicester Tigers in the Guinness Premiership Final. This sealed a dream send-off for the retiring Lawrence Dallaglio at Twickenham. Wasps won 26–16 thanks to penalties by Mark van Gisbergen and tries by Josh Lewsey and Tom Rees to become the English 2008 champions. Wasps have now won six league titles in all, equal with Bath and just one behind Leicester.

The 2008–09 season was to see Wasps come unstuck. With their captain having retired, many of the players failed to play to their full potential. Wasps would eventually finish in seventh place, having also failed to reach the knock-out stages of the Heineken Cup and EDF Anglo Welsh Cup. On 12 May 2009 it was announced in the evening standard that Ian McGeechan had been forced to step down and will now take a consultancy role both at London Wasps and London Scottish. This was confirmed by the BBC on 14 May. Tony Hanks, a former coach at the club, was announced as the new Director of Rugby soon after. He had more recently been coaching at Waikato and also been a stand in for McGeechan for the latter part of the 2008/09 season, while he was primarily committed to British and Irish Lions duty. McGeechan had technically been a Lions employee for the whole season and through agreement with Wasps was loaned back to the club.

The 2009–10 season started off with an exodus of key players including James Haskell and Tom Palmer who moved to Stade Français, Riki Flutey who also crossed the channel to join Brive and Eoin Reddan who left to join Leinster in Ireland.

In late February it was announced that Danny Cipriani would be leaving for the Melbourne Rebels in Australia and he was determined to leave on a high.

After beating Gloucester 42–26 in the quarter-final of the Amlin Cup scoring five tries (including a hat-trick from winger Tom Varndell), Wasps lost 15–18 at home to Cardiff Blues in the semi-final with Dave Walder kicking all of Wasps points with five penalties. Cardiff subsequently beat French Top 14 side Toulon in the final of the competition at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille.

Shaun Edwards left the club in November 2011.

Wasps had a poor 2011–12 season, finishing in their lowest position for many seasons in 11th place, narrowly avoiding relegation from the Premiership. The season was notable for a good start where Wasps beat with a 15–20 reigning champions Saracens at Twickenham in the opening match and then runners-up Leicester in the second match with a 35–29. Things went downhill from there on as the worst injury toll known to professional rugby union hit the squad with a combined total of 16 serious and long-term injuries and retirements.

Dai Young recruited well through the summer bringing in players such as Andrea Masi (2012 6 Nations Player Of The Tournament) and Stephen Jones. He also welcomed back former Wasps Tom Palmer and James Haskell.

Wasps beat their record of their European highest-scoring margin with a 90–17 win against Viadana on 12 October 2013, beating the 77–17 margin of victory against Toulouse on 26 October 1996.

===Wasps Rugby relocation to West Midlands: 2014===

On 30 June 2014, the club announced that the &quot;London&quot; prefix of the name had been dropped, returning to Wasps for the first time since the re-branding in 1999.

In September 2014, Simon Gilbert, of the &quot;Coventry Telegraph&quot; reported the side were in talks to permanently relocate to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, from their home at Adams Park, in High Wycombe. In October 2014 Wasps announced that from December 2014 they would play their home games at the Ricoh Arena. On 14 November 2014 Wasps confirmed the purchase of the final 50% of shares in the stadium from the Higgs Charity to become outright owners of the facility.

Their first game as owners was a 48–16 win against London Irish on 21 December 2014.

===Wasps in Coventry: 2014–2022===
The 2014–15 season saw Wasps finish 6th. Andy Goode was the Premiership&#x27;s top scorer, ending the season with 240 points.

Things improved for Wasps in the 2015–16 season, with them finishing 3rd in the league. They lost their play-off semi-final with eventual runners-up Exeter Chiefs.

Wasps finished 1st in the 2016–17 regular season. Despite this success, Wasps went on to lose to Exeter Chiefs in the play-off final, having beaten Leicester in the semi-final.

In the 2017–18 regular season, Wasps finished 3rd. They faced Saracens in the semi-final play-off, but lost 57–33. The 2017–18 season marked 150 years since the foundation of Wasps Rugby Football Club and was celebrated with an anniversary game against Bath Rugby.

The 2018–19 campaign saw Wasps slip to an 8th-place finish overall. Across the season, Wasps recorded 10 wins and 12 losses.

The 2019–20 Gallagher Premiership Season saw huge improvement for Wasps who finished 2nd in the table (71 points) behind league leaders Exeter Chiefs (74 points). As a result of finishing 2nd, Wasps earned a home semi-final against Bristol Bears on Saturday 10 October 2020 at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. Wasps won 47–24 earning a place in the Gallagher Premiership Final on Saturday 24 October 2020 against Exeter Chiefs at Twickenham Stadium. In a repeat of the outcome of the 2016–17 Final, Wasps were defeated by Exeter Chiefs. The result was 19–13.

The 2020–21 season saw another slump for Wasps who fell out of the Top 4 playoff positions, finishing 8th in the table.

In May 2021 it was announced that Wasps&#x27; home stadium would be renamed to the Coventry Building Society Arena. On Monday 19 July 2021, Wasps announced a new logo to bring all elements of Wasps including the Netball team, Women and Amateur rugby sides under one new visual identity.

===Financial troubles and administration: 2022===

On 15 May 2022, Wasps failed to repay the £35 million bond finance they had raised in 2015, however stated they hoped to re-finance by 13 August. On 13 August 2022, Wasps did not refinance the bond, with owner Derek Richardson stating &quot;we are not in administration and we are not going to be&quot; after rumours of administration appeared on the internet.
On 21 September 2022, Wasps Holdings announced their intention to appoint administrators due to ongoing financial difficulty. After a second notice of intention was filed on 4 October, the club were suspended from all tournaments on 12 October due to inability to field a team and Wasps Holdings were placed into administration on 17 October 2022 with all their playing and coaching staff made redundant. The team had their current results removed and were also relegated to the RFU Championship, the second tier of English rugby. The club had debts totalling £95 million.

On 30 October it was confirmed that the administrators had accepted an offer from a consortium to buy the club, with the RFU expecting a &#x27;decision ahead of Christmas.&#x27;

The club confirmed on 16 December that the club had been successfully sold and exited administration. It was also confirmed that they had satisfied all RFU requirements to join the Championship from the 2023–24 season. They were rumoured to be remaining in the West Midlands as they were rumoured to have agreed a groundshare with Solihull Moors at the ARMCO Arena.

Following an extended deadline of 14 February 2023 to submit an application to the RFU Wasps were announced as formally able to compete in the Championship for the 2023–24 season on 15 February. However, this position was rescinded on 18 May 2023 as a result of a failure to hit a deadline to confirm commitments made when the license was first approved in December. As a result, they will now be placed &quot;at the bottom of the playing pyramid in tier ten&quot; of the English rugby union system.

===Proposed move to Swanley===

In 2023 a Sevenoaks District Council spokesman said that Wasps, owned by Christopher Holland, were considering building a multi-use stadium, training facilities, a hotel, and enabling development on the outskirts of Swanley, Kent.

==Rivalries==
Wasps&#x27; main rival were Harlequins in Twickenham, London. Both clubs were once unified as Hampstead Football Club. Wasps split from Hampstead Football Club (which changed its name to Harlequin F.C. in 1870) over discord among members in 1867.

Following Wasps&#x27; move to Coventry, Wasps tried to kindle rivalries with other clubs in the Midlands of England. This included the likes of Leicester Tigers and Northampton Saints leading one rugby commentator to state that the games, &quot;lack the history that a derby demands&quot;.

==Wasps Netball==
Wasps expanded their sporting brand in 2016 with the addition of Wasps Netball. They play their home games at the Indoor Arena - Coventry located in the Coventry Building Society Arena.

In the 2018 and 2019 Netball Superleague seasons, they finished in top position, with Loughborough Lightning in 2nd place. Both teams proceeded to the Grand Final for a 2017 rematch, with Wasps winning their 2nd consecutive title with a scoreline identical to the 2017 and 2018 finals.

Wasps Netball were also placed into administration on 17 October 2022 with all their playing and coaching staff made redundant.

On 10 November 2022, England Netball announced that Wasps Netball would no longer be eligible to compete in the Netball Super League moving forwards.

==Home ground==
Wasps&#x27; first home was in Finchley Road, North London although subsequent years saw grounds being rented in various parts of London. In 1923 the club moved to a permanent home at Repton Avenue, Sudbury, Middlesex, eventually buying the ground outright. 

===Loftus Road===
In 1996 Wasps moved to play their home games at Queens Park Rangers&#x27; home ground, Loftus Road, in West London. The site of the ground at Sudbury was later developed for housing, though the original club house still stands and is used as a community centre.

===Adams Park===
Wasps made another move in 2002, this time west of Greater London, playing their home games at Wycombe Wanderers F.C.&#x27;s ground, Adams Park, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. The attendance figure went up by 31.8% the next season. Between 2004 and 2015 Wasps took part in the London Double Header at Twickenham, this was a designated home match in 2005, 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2013. In 2006 this drew a crowd of 51,950, breaking the record set in 2004.

In 2007 Wasps, Wycombe Wanderers and Wycombe District Council entered a joint venture that would fund a new stadium in the High Wycombe area. The favoured site for the new stadium was at Wycombe Air Park, a site owned by Wycombe District Council and close to the M40 motorway. The planned stadium was of 16–17,000 capacity, and would have been the first new football ground in England with terraced section since the Taylor Report. The development would also have included retail, hotel, conference and other facilities. Wasps and Wanderers funding was primarily from Steve Hayes, who had become a 25% share holder through a £250,000 investment in Wycombe Wanderers in June 2004, when the football club became a plc company; and later became managing director. Hayes bought an 11.6% stake in London Wasps Holdings Ltd in August 2007, and became chairman of Lawrence Dallaglio&#x27;s benefit committee. In December 2008, Hayes bought Wright&#x27;s controlling interest and John O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s share holding in Wasps to take complete control. After the stadium plans at Booker Airfield were turned down, Steve Hayes put the club up for sale, with Derek Richardson becoming principal shareholder in April 2013

===Coventry Building Society Arena===

Wasps&#x27; first official home game in Coventry was during the 2007–08 Heineken Cup when they used the Ricoh Arena as their home venue against Munster on 10 November 2007 due to its bigger capacity. While commercially the move was seen as a success, with Wasps winning the game 24–23 in front of a crowd of 21,506, the move attracted severe criticism from many of the club&#x27;s supporters, citing the long distance from London (a round-trip of almost 200 miles for London-based fans). The club argued that they had little choice but to relocate the match as their landlords, Wycombe Wanderers, had a home FA Cup tie the same day.

On 7 October 2014, Wasps purchased 50% in Arena Coventry Ltd (the operating company of the Ricoh Arena) with the intention of relocating to the Midlands. After gaining a 100% stake in the company on 14 November 2014, Wasps played their first game in Coventry as owners on 21 December 2014; a 48–16 win against London Irish. While initially the relocation was only for 1st team home games; the club relocated completely ahead of the 2016–17 season.

After the team entered administration in 2022, the Coventry Building Society Arena was purchased by the Frasers Group on 17 November 2022 and Wasps ceased to be based there.

Previous manufacturers include Canterbury and Kukri.

<text>HMS &quot;Corunna&quot; (D97) was a later or 1943 fleet destroyer of the Royal Navy. She was named in honour of the Battle of Corunna, which took place during the Peninsular War in 1809 between British and French forces. &quot;Corunna&quot; was built by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Limited on the Tyne. She was launched on 29 May 1945 and commissioned on 6 June 1947.

==Design and construction==
The Battle-class was developed as a result of operational experience in the early years of the Second World War, which had shown that the Royal Navy&#x27;s existing destroyers had inadequate anti-aircraft protection, and in particular, lacked a modern dual-purpose main gun armament, capable of dealing with both surface targets and air attack, with guns lacking the high elevation mountings necessary to deal with dive bombers. The resulting design was armed with two twin 4.5 inch high-angle gun-turrets of a new design mounted forward and a heavy close-in anti-aircraft armament, with 16 Battle-class destroyers ordered under the 1942 construction programme.

For the 1943 construction programme, 24 Battle-class destroyers of a revised design (known as &quot;1943 Battles&quot;) were ordered, with three destroyers (&quot;Corunna&quot;, &quot;Oudenarde&quot; and &quot;River Plate&quot;) to be built by Swan Hunter.

&quot;Corunna&quot; was long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of normal and at full load. Displacement was standard and full load. Two Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplied steam at and to two sets of Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of ( at full load. of fuel oil was carried, giving an endurance of at .

Two twin 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mark IV gun mounts, capable of elevating to 85 degrees, were mounted forward, while a single 4.5 inch gun, elevating to 55 degrees was fitted behind the funnel - this fifth gun, which could fire astern, replaced a 4-inch gun fitted to the 1942 Battles used for firing Star shell and could be controlled by the main fire control system. Close-in anti-aircraft armament was eight Bofors 40 mm gun, with two twin stabilised STAAG mounts, with integrated fire control, aft, one simple Mark V twin mount amidships, and two single mounts on the bridge wings. Two quintuple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo-tubes were fitted, with a Squid anti-submarine mortar aft.

&quot;Corunna&quot;, named after the 1809 Battle of Corunna, was one of thirteen 1943 Battles ordered on 23 April 1943. The destroyer was laid down at Swan Hunter&#x27;s Tyneside shipyard on 12 April 1944, was launched on 29 May 1945. The end of the Second World War in August 1945 resulted in the decision to cancel 16 of the 1943 Battles, with construction of the remaining ships slowed. &quot;Corunna&quot; was commissioned on 23 May 1947, and was completed on 6 June 1947.

==Service==
On commissioning, &quot;Corunna&quot; joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet, but was temporarily laid up in reserve for several months from October 1947 owing to a manning crisis in the Royal Navy. On 8 December 1948 &quot;Corunna&quot; was in collision with the oiler while being refuelled, and was under repair at Chatham from 16 December to 18 February 1949. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1954, &quot;Corunna&quot;, with the rest of the Squadron, formerly Flotilla, deployed to the Mediterranean, remaining there until 1955. &quot;Corunna&quot;, with the rest of the Squadron, returned to the region in 1956 and took part in the Suez Crisis. On 15 March 1959, &quot;Corunna&quot; accidentally collided with her sister ship in the Bay Of Biscay.
&quot;Corunna&quot; subsequently began her conversion to a Radar Picket, of which three other ships were also converted. The conversion included new Anti-Aircraft weaponry, new radar, and the addition of the Sea Cat missile system. In 1962, &quot;Corunna&quot; joined the 7th Destroyer Squadron, based in the Mediterranean, and the following year joined the 21st Escort Squadron.

In 1964, &quot;Corunna&quot; deployed, along with the rest of the Squadron, to the Far East, where she would remain until 1965.

==Decommissioning and fate==
In 1967, &quot;Corunna&quot; was placed in reserve and was put on the disposal list in 1972. On Friday 17 January 1975 &quot;Corunna&quot; was photographed alongside the partially demolished D86 HMS Agincourt at Sunderland. In 1975, &quot;Corunna&quot; arrived at Blyth in Northumberland where she was subsequently broken up.

<text>Donald Newcombe (June 14, 1926 – February 19, 2019), nicknamed &quot;Newk&quot;, was an American professional baseball pitcher who played ten non-consecutive seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He began his career in the Negro National League and ended it in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).

Newcombe was the first pitcher to win the Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, and Cy Young Awards during his career. This distinction would not be achieved again until 2011, when Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander, who was Rookie of the Year in 2006, won the Cy Young and MVP awards. In 1949, he became the first black pitcher to start a World Series game. In 1951, Newcombe was the first black pitcher to win 20 games in one season. In 1956, the inaugural year of the Cy Young Award, he became the first pitcher to win the National League MVP and the Cy Young in the same season.

Newcombe was an excellent hitting pitcher who compiled a career batting average of .271 with 15 home runs and was used as a pinch hitter, a rarity for pitchers.

==Early life==
Newcombe was born in Madison, New Jersey, on June 14, 1926, and was raised in Elizabeth. He had three brothers and a sister. His father worked as a chauffeur.

Newcombe attended Jefferson High School in Elizabeth. The school did not have a baseball team, so Newcombe played semi-professional baseball while attending high school.

==Career==
After playing briefly with the Newark Eagles in the Negro National League in 1944 and 1945, Newcombe signed with the Dodgers. With catcher Roy Campanella, Newcombe played for the first racially integrated baseball team based in the United States in the 20th century, the 1946 Nashua Dodgers of the New England League. He continued to play for Nashua in 1947 before being promoted to the Montreal Royals of the Class AAA International League in 1948.

Newcombe debuted for Brooklyn on May 20, 1949, becoming the third African American pitcher in the major leagues, after Dan Bankhead and Satchel Paige. Effa Manley, business manager for the Eagles, agreed to let the Dodgers&#x27; Branch Rickey sign Newcombe to a contract. Manley was not compensated for the release of Newcombe. He immediately helped the Dodgers to the league pennant as he earned seventeen victories, led the league in shutouts, and pitched 32 consecutive scoreless innings. He was also among the first four black players to be named to an All-Star team, along with teammates Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella and the Indians&#x27; Larry Doby. Newcombe was named Rookie of the Year by both &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. In 1950, he won 19 games, and 20 the following season, also leading the league in strikeouts in 1951. In the memorable playoff game between the Dodgers and the Giants at the end of the 1951 season, Newcombe was relieved by Ralph Branca in the bottom of the ninth inning when Clyde Sukeforth instructed manager Chuck Dressen to bring in Branca. Branca then surrendered the walk-off home run to Bobby Thomson to give the Giants the pennant.

After two years of mandatory military duty during the Korean War, Newcombe suffered a disappointing season in 1954, going 9–8 with a 4.55 earned run average, but returned to form the next year by finishing second in the NL in both wins and earned run average, with marks of 20–5 and 3.20, as the Dodgers won their first World Series in franchise history. He had an even greater 1956 season, with marks of 27–7, 139 strikeouts, and a 3.06 ERA, five shutouts and 18 complete games, leading the league in winning percentage for the second year in a row. He was named the National League&#x27;s MVP, and was awarded the first-ever Cy Young Award, then given to the best pitcher in the combined major leagues. He was the only player to win MVP, Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards until Justin Verlander accomplished the feat in 2011. Newcombe had a difficult time in the 1956 World Series. He was the losing pitcher in Game 7. Berra, who hit three home runs off of him in the series, hit two of them in Game 7. The Yankees and Johnny Kucks won 9–0.

Following the Dodgers&#x27; move to Los Angeles, Newcombe got off to an 0–6 start in 1958 before being traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Steve Bilko, Johnny Klippstein, and two players to be named later during the season. He posted a record of 24–21 with Cincinnati until his contract was sold to Cleveland in mid-1960. He finished with a 2–3 mark in Cleveland before being released to end his major league career. Newcombe acknowledged that alcoholism played a significant role in the decline of his career.

On May 28, 1962, Newcombe signed with the Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Central League. Newcombe played one season in Japan, splitting time as an outfielder and a first baseman, only pitching in one game. In 81 games, he hit .262 with 12 home runs and 43 runs batted in (RBIs).

In his ten-year major league career, Newcombe registered a record of 149–90, with 1,129 strikeouts and a 3.56 ERA, 136 complete games and 24 shutouts in 2,154 innings pitched. In addition to his pitching abilities, Newcombe was a dangerous hitter, hitting seven home runs in the 1955 season. He batted .271 (ninth-best average in history among pitchers), with 15 home runs, 108 RBIs, 238 hits, 33 doubles, three triples, 94 runs scored and 87 walks.

A historic marker was installed in Nashua, NH by the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire to celebrate the achievements of Newcombe and Roy Campanella in 2023.

==Life after retirement==

Newcombe rejoined the Dodger organization in the late 1970s and served as the team&#x27;s Director of Community Affairs. In March 2009, he was named special adviser to the chairman of the team.

Newcombe was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2016 and into the initial class of &quot;Legends of Dodger Baseball&quot; in 2019.

==Personal life==
Newcombe was married three times. His first wife was Freddie Green, whom he married in 1945 and divorced in 1960. They had 3 children Evit, Gregory (died 1998), and Robin (died 2015). Evit resides in Florida. A week after his divorce from Green, he married Billie Roberts, a marriage which lasted until they divorced in 1994. Newcombe&#x27;s third wife, Karen Kroner, survived him.

Newcombe dealt with alcoholism in the 1950s and 1960s, describing himself as &quot;a stupefied, wife-abusing, child-frightening, falling-down drunk&quot;. His alcoholism became so severe that, in 1965, he pawned his World Series ring in order to afford alcohol. He quit drinking in 1966, when his wife threatened to leave him. In his personal and professional life, he helped numerous other people including military personnel and Dodgers teammate Maury Wills in their own battles against substance abuse.

At a fundraising event for Senator Barbara Boxer, President Barack Obama referred to Newcombe (who was attending the event) as &quot;someone who helped... America become what it is. 

I would not be here if it were not for Jackie and it were not for Don Newcombe.
:- Barack Obama, April 19, 2010.

Newcombe died on the morning of February 19, 2019, at the age of 92, following a long illness. His death was announced by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He&#x27;s interred at the Los Angeles National Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<doc id="629572" wikidata="Q85125" url="?curid=629572" title="Population transfer in the Soviet Union">
<text>From 1930 to 1952, the government of the Soviet Union, on the orders of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and under the direction of the NKVD official Lavrentiy Beria, forcibly transferred populations of various groups. These actions may be classified into the following broad categories: deportations of &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; categories of population (often classified as &quot;enemies of the people&quot;), deportations of entire nationalities, labor force transfer, and organized migrations in opposite directions to fill ethnically cleansed territories. Dekulakization marked the first time that an entire class was deported, whereas the deportation of Soviet Koreans in 1937 marked the precedent of a specific ethnic deportation of an entire nationality.

In most cases, their destinations were underpopulated remote areas (see Forced settlements in the Soviet Union). This includes deportations to the Soviet Union of non-Soviet citizens from countries outside the USSR. It has been estimated that, in their entirety, internal forced migrations affected at least 6 million people. Of this total, 1.8 million kulaks were deported in 1930–31, 1.0 million peasants and ethnic minorities in 1932–39, whereas about 3.5 million ethnic minorities were further resettled during 1940–52.

Soviet archives documented 390,000 deaths during kulak forced resettlement and up to 400,000 deaths of people deported to forced settlements during the 1940s; however, Nicolas Werth places overall deaths closer to some 1 to 1.5 million perishing as a result of the deportations. Contemporary historians classify these deportations as a crime against humanity and ethnic persecution. Two of these cases with the highest mortality rates have been described as genocides–the deportation of the Crimean Tatars was declared as genocide by Ukraine and three other countries, whereas the deportation of the Chechens and Ingush was declared as genocide by the European Parliament, respectively. On 26 April 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, under its chairman Boris Yeltsin, passed the law On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples with Article 2 denouncing all mass deportations as &quot;Stalin&#x27;s policy of defamation and genocide.&quot;

The Soviet Union also practiced deportations in occupied territories, with over 50,000 perishing from the Baltic States and 300,000 to 360,000 perishing during the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe due to Soviet deportation, massacres, and internment and labour camps.

== Deportation of social groups ==

Many Soviet farmers, regardless of their actual income or property, were labeled &quot;Kulaks&quot; for resisting collectivization. This term historically referred to relatively affluent farmers since the later Russian Empire. Kulak was the most common category of deported Soviet citizen. Resettlement of people officially designated as &quot;kulaks&quot; continued until early 1950, including several major waves: on 5 September 1951 the Soviet government ordered the deportation of kulaks from the Lithuanian SSR for &quot;hostile actions against kolhozes&quot;, which was one of the last resettlements of that social group.

Large numbers of &quot;kulaks&quot;, regardless of their nationality, were resettled in Siberia and Central Asia. According to data from Soviet archives, which were published in 1990, 1,803,392 people were sent to labor colonies and camps in 1930 and 1931, and 1,317,022 reached the destination. Deportations on a smaller scale continued after 1931. The reported number of kulaks and their relatives who died in labour colonies from 1932 to 1940 was 389,521. The total number of the deported people is disputed. Conservative estimates assume that 1,679,528-1,803,392 people were deported, while the highest estimates are that 15 million kulaks and their families were deported by 1937, and that during the deportation many people died, but the full number is not known.

==Ethnic operations==
During the 1930s, categorisation of so-called enemies of the people shifted from the usual Marxist–Leninist, class-based terms, such as &quot;kulak&quot;, to ethnic-based ones. The partial removal of potentially trouble-making ethnic groups was a technique used consistently by Joseph Stalin during his government; between 1935 and 1938 alone, at least ten different nationalities were deported. Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union led to a massive escalation in Soviet ethnic cleansing.

The Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union, originally conceived in 1926, initiated in 1930, and carried through in 1937, was the first mass transfer of an entire nationality in the Soviet Union. Almost the entire Soviet population of ethnic Koreans (171,781 people) were forcibly moved from the Russian Far East to unpopulated areas of the Kazakh SSR and the Uzbek SSR in October 1937.

Looking at the entire period of Stalin&#x27;s rule, one can list: Poles (1939–1941 and 1944–1945), Kola Norwegians (1940–1942), Romanians (1941 and 1944–1953), Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians (1941 and 1945–1949), Volga Germans (1941–1945), Ingrian Finns (1929–1931 and 1935–1939), Finnish people in Karelia (1940–1941, 1944), Crimean Tatars, Crimean Greeks (1944) and Caucasus Greeks (1949–50), Kalmyks, Balkars, Italians of Crimea, Karachays, Meskhetian Turks, Karapapaks, Far East Koreans (1937), Chechens and Ingushs (1944). Shortly before, during and immediately after World War II, Stalin conducted a series of deportations on a huge scale which profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union. It is estimated that between 1941 and 1949 nearly 3.3 million were deported to Siberia and the Central Asian republics. By some estimates, up to 43% of the resettled population died of diseases and malnutrition.

===Western annexations and deportations, 1939–1941===

Lavrentiy Beria, the Chief of the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, was responsible for organizing and executing numerous deportations of ethnic minorities during that time.

After the Soviet invasion of Poland following the corresponding German invasion that marked the start of World War II in 1939, the Soviet Union annexed the eastern parts of Poland (known as &quot;Kresy&quot; in Poland or known as West Belarus and West Ukraine in the USSR as well as in Belarus and Ukraine) of the Second Polish Republic, which then became the western parts of the Belarusian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR. From 1939–1941, 1.45 million people who inhabited the region were deported by the Soviet regime. According to Polish historians, 63.1% of these people were Poles and 7.4% of them were Jews. Previously, it was believed that about 1.0 million Polish citizens died at the hands of the Soviets, but recently, Polish historians, mostly based upon their study of Soviet archives, estimate that about 350,000 people who were deported from 1939–1945 died.

The same policy was implemented in the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia (see Soviet deportations from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). More than 200,000 people are estimated to have been deported from the Baltic in 1940–1953. In addition, at least 75,000 were sent to the Gulag. 10% of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to labor camps. In 1989, native Latvians represented only 52% of the population of their own country. In Estonia, the figure was 62%. In Lithuania, the situation was better because the migrants sent to that country actually moved to the former area of Eastern Prussia (now Kaliningrad) which, contrary to the original plans, never became part of Lithuania.

Likewise, Romanians from Chernivtsi Oblast and Moldavia had been deported in great numbers which range from 200,000 to 400,000. (See Soviet deportations from Bessarabia.)

===World War II, 1941–1945===

During World War II, particularly in 1943–44, the Soviet government conducted a series of deportations. Some 1.9 million people were deported to Siberia and the Central Asian republics. According to the Soviets, of approximately 183,000 Crimean Tatars, 20,000 or 10% of the entire population served in German battalions, though the figure in question is derived from a single SS report on how many individuals were expected to be willing to collaborate and is contradicted by official statistical records, which suggest the number was actually around 3,000, with only 800 being volunteers. Consequently, Tatars too were transferred &quot;en masse&quot; by the Soviets after the war. Vyacheslav Molotov justified this decision saying &quot;The fact is that during the war we received reports about mass treason. Battalions of Caucasians opposed us at the fronts and attacked us from the rear. It was a matter of life and death; there was no time to investigate the details. Of course innocents suffered. But I hold that given the circumstances, we acted correctly.&quot; Historian Ian Grey writes &quot;Towards the Moslem peoples, the Germans pursued a benign, almost paternalistic policy. The Karachai, Balkars, Ingush, Chechen, Kalmucks, and Tatars of the Crimea all displayed pro-German sympathies in some degree. It was only the hurried withdrawal of the Germans from the Caucasus after the battle of Stalingrad that prevented their organizing the Moslem people for effective anti-Soviet action. The Germans boasted loudly, however, that they had left a strong &quot;fifth column&quot; behind them in the Caucasus.&quot;

Volga Germans and seven (non-Slavic) nationalities of the Crimea and the northern Caucasus were deported: the Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingush, Balkars, Karachays, and Meskhetian Turks. All Crimean Tatars were deported &quot;en masse&quot;, in a form of collective punishment, on 18 May 1944 as special settlers to Uzbekistan and other distant parts of the Soviet Union. According to NKVD data, nearly 20% died in exile during the following year and a half. Crimean Tatar activists have reported this figure to be nearly 46%. (See Deportation of Crimean Tatars.)

Other minorities evicted from the Black Sea coastal region included Bulgarians, Crimean Greeks, Romanians and Armenians.

The Soviet Union also deported people from occupied territories such as the Baltic states, Poland, and territories occupied by Germans. A study published by the German government in 1974 estimated the number of German civilian victims of crimes during expulsion of Germans after World War II between 1945 and 1948 to be over 600,000, with about 400,000 deaths in the areas east of the Oder and Neisse (ca. 120,000 in acts of direct violence, mostly by Soviet troops but also by Poles, 60,000 in Polish and 40,000 in Soviet concentration camps or prisons mostly from hunger and disease, and 200,000 deaths among civilian deportees to forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union), 130,000 in Czechoslovakia (thereof 100,000 in camps) and 80,000 in Yugoslavia (thereof 15,000 to 20,000 from violence outside of and in camps and 59,000 deaths from hunger and disease in camps).

By January 1953, there were 988,373 special settlers residing in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, including 444,005 Germans, 244,674 Chechens, 95,241 Koreans, 80,844 Ingush, and the others. As a consequence of these deportations, Kazakhs comprised only 30% of their native Republic&#x27;s population.

==Post-war expulsion and deportation==
After World War II, the German population of the Kaliningrad Oblast, formerly East Prussia, was expelled and the depopulated area resettled by Soviet citizens, mainly by Russians. Between 1944 and 1953 a variety of groups from the Black Sea region — Kurds, Iranians, Greeks, Bulgarians, Armenians, and Hemshins were deported away from the Soviet border regions in Crimea and the Transcaucasus.

Poland and Soviet Ukraine conducted population exchanges; Poles who resided east of the established Poland–Soviet border were deported to Poland (c.a. 2,100,000 people) and Ukrainians that resided west of the established Poland-Soviet Union border were deported to Soviet Ukraine. Population transfer to Soviet Ukraine occurred from September 1944 to April 1946 (ca. 450,000 people). Some Ukrainians (ca. 200,000 people) left southeast Poland more or less voluntarily (between 1944 and 1945).

==Labor force transfer==
There were several notable campaigns of targeted non-penal workforce transfer.
*Twenty-five-thousanders
*NKVD labor columns
*Virgin Lands campaign
*Baku oil industry workers transfer: during the German-Soviet War, in October 1942, about 10,000 workers from the petroleum sites of Baku, together with their families, were transferred to several sites with potential oil production (the &quot;Second Baku&quot; area (Volga-Ural oil field), Kazakhstan and Sakhalin), in face of the potential German threat, although Germany failed to seize Baku.
*Khetagurovite Campaign

==Repatriation after World War II==

When the war ended in May 1945, thousands of Soviet citizens were forcefully repatriated (against their will) into the USSR. On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the Yalta Conference, the United States and United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR.

The interpretation of this Agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviet citizens regardless of their wishes. Allied authorities ordered their military forces in Europe to deport to the Soviet Union millions of former residents of the USSR (some of whom collaborated with the Germans), including numerous people who had left Russia and established different citizenships for up to decades prior. The forced repatriation operations took place from 1945 to 1947.

At the end of World War II, more than 5 million &quot;displaced people&quot; from the Soviet Union survived in German captivity. About 3 million had been forced laborers (Ostarbeiter) in Germany and occupied territories.

Surviving POWs, about 1.5 million, repatriated &quot;Ostarbeiter&quot;, and other displaced people, totalling more than 4,000,000 people were sent to special NKVD filtration camps (not Gulag). By 1946, 80% civilians and 20% of PoWs were freed, 5% of civilians, and 43% of PoWs re-drafted, 10% of civilians and 22% of PoWs were sent to labor battalions, and 2% of civilians and 15% of the PoWs (226,127 out of 1,539,475 total) transferred to the NKVD, i.e. the Gulag.

==Rehabilitation==
===In the USSR===
On 17 January 1956, a Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was issued on lifting restrictions on the Poles evicted in 1936; on 17 March 1956 for the Kalmyks; 27 March for the Greeks, Bulgarians, and Armenians; 18 April for the Crimean Tatars, Balkars, Meskhetian Turks, Kurds, and Hemshins; 16 July for the Chechens, Ingush, and Karachais (all without the right to return to their homeland).

In February 1956, Nikita Khrushchev, in his speech &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot;, condemned the deportations as a violation of Leninist principles:

In 1957 and 1958, the national autonomies of Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingush, Karachais, and Balkars were restored; these peoples were allowed to return to their historical territories. The return of repressed peoples was not carried out without difficulties, which both then and subsequently led to national conflicts (thus, clashes began between returning Chechens and the Russians who settled during their exile in the Grozny Oblast; Ingush in the Prigorodny District, populated by Ossetians and transferred to the North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic).

However, a significant number of the repressed peoples (Volga Germans, Crimean Tatars, Meskhetian Turks, Greeks, Koreans, etc.) had still received neither national autonomy nor the right to return to their historical homeland.

On 29 August 1964, 23 years after the start of the deportation, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, by its Decree of 29 August 1964 No. 2820-VI, abolished sweeping accusations against the German population living in the Volga region. A decree that completely lifted restrictions on freedom of movement and confirmed the right of Germans to return to the places they were expelled was adopted in 1972.

In the mid-1960s, the process of rehabilitation of the &quot;punished peoples&quot; was almost stopped.

According to a secret Soviet Ministry of Interior report dated December 1965, for the period 1940–1953, 46,000 people were deported from Moldova, 61,000 from Belarus, 571,000 from Ukraine, 119,000 from Lithuania, 53,000 from Latvia, and 33,000 from Estonia.

===During the years of perestroika===
During the Soviet era, the problems which were experienced by people who were deported from their historic places of residence after they were accused of aiding the enemies of the Soviet state did not become the subject of public attention until the years of perestroika. One of the first steps towards the restoration of historic justice in relation to repressed peoples was the publication of the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 14 November 1989 &quot;On recognizing illegal and criminal repressive acts against peoples subjected to forced resettlement and ensuring their rights&quot;. In accordance with this decree, all repressed peoples were rehabilitated, and at the state level, repressive acts against them which were in the form of a policy of slander, genocide, forced relocation, the abolition of national-state entities, and the establishment of a regime of terror and violence in places of special settlements were all recognized as illegal and criminal measures.

===In post-Soviet Russia===
On 26 April 1991, the RSFSR Law No. 1107-I &quot;On the rehabilitation of repressed peoples&quot; was adopted, which recognized the deportation of peoples as a &quot;policy of slander and genocide&quot; (Article 2). Among other things, the law recognized the right of repressed peoples to restore the territorial integrity that existed before the unconstitutional policy of forcibly redrawing borders, to restore national-state formations that existed before their abolition, and to compensate for damage caused by the state.

Mukharbek Didigov called this law a triumph of historical justice. In his opinion, the fact that the state recognizes repression as illegal, inhumane actions directed against innocent people is an indicator of the development of democratic institutions, which has a special moral significance for deported peoples. According to him, the law gives confidence that this will not happen again.

In furtherance of the law &quot;On the rehabilitation of repressed peoples&quot;, several legislative acts were adopted, including the resolution of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 16 July 1992 &quot;On the rehabilitation of the Cossacks&quot;; the Resolution of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 1 April 1993 &quot;On the rehabilitation of Russian Koreans&quot;; the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of 24 January 1992 &quot;On priority measures for the practical restoration of the legal rights of the repressed peoples of the Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;; the Resolution of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 29 June 1993 &quot;On the rehabilitation of Russian Finns&quot;, etc.

15 years after recognition in the USSR, in February 2004, the European Parliament also recognized the deportation of Chechens and Ingush in 1944 as an act of genocide.

On 24 September 2012, deputies from United Russia introduced a bill on additional assistance to representatives of repressed peoples to the State Duma. The bill&#x27;s authors proposed allocating 23 billion rubles from the federal budget to help political prisoners. According to the authors, this money should be used for monthly payments and compensation for lost property in the amount of up to 35 thousand rubles.

==Modern views==
Several historians, including Russian historian Pavel Polian and Lithuanian Associate Research Scholar at Yale University Violeta Davoliūtė consider these mass deportations of civilians a crime against humanity. They are also often described as Soviet ethnic cleansing. Terry Martin of Harvard University observes:

Other academics and countries go further to call the deportations of the Crimean Tatars, Chechens and Ingushs genocide. Raphael Lemkin, a lawyer of Polish-Jewish descent who initiated the Genocide Convention and coined the term genocide himself, assumed that genocide was perpetrated in the context of the mass deportation of the Chechens, Ingush, Volga Germans, Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks and Karachay. Professor Lyman H. Legters argued that the Soviet penal system, combined with its resettlement policies, should count as genocidal since the sentences were borne most heavily specifically on certain ethnic groups, and that a relocation of these ethnic groups, whose survival depended on ties to their particular homeland, &quot;had a genocidal effect remediable only by restoration of the group to its homeland&quot;. Soviet dissidents Ilya Gabay and Pyotr Grigorenko both classified the population transfers of the Crimean Tatars as genocide. Historian Timothy Snyder included it in a list of Soviet policies that &quot;meet the standard of genocide&quot;. French historian and expert on communist studies Nicolas Werth, German historian Philipp Ther, Professor Anthony James Joes, American journalist Eric Margolis, Canadian political scientist Adam Jones, professor of Islamic History at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth Brian Glyn Williams, scholars Michael Fredholm and Fanny E. Bryan also considered the population transfers of the Chechens and Ingush as the crime of genocide. German investigative journalist Lutz Kleveman compared the deportations of Chechens and Ingush to a &quot;slow genocide&quot;.

On 12 December 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament issued a resolution recognizing the deportation of Crimean Tatars as genocide and established 18 May as the &quot;Day of Remembrance for the victims of the Crimean Tatar genocide.&quot; The parliament of Latvia recognized the event as an act of genocide on 9 May 2019. The Parliament of Lithuania did the same on 6 June 2019. Canadian Parliament passed a motion on 10 June 2019, recognizing the Crimean Tatar deportation of 1944 (Sürgünlik) as a genocide perpetrated by Soviet dictator Stalin, designating 18 May to be a day of remembrance. The deportation of Chechens and Ingush was acknowledged by the European Parliament as an act of genocide in 2004:

Experts of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum cited the events of 1944 for a reason of placing Chechnya on their genocide watch list for its potential for genocide. The separatist government of Chechnya also recognized it as genocide. Some academics disagree with the classification of deportation as genocide. Professor Alexander Statiev argues that Stalin&#x27;s administration did not have a conscious genocidal intent to exterminate the various deported peoples, but that Soviet &quot;political culture, poor planning, haste, and wartime shortages were responsible for the genocidal death rate among them.&quot; He rather considers these deportations an example of Soviet assimilation of &quot;unwanted nations.&quot; According to Professor Amir Weiner, &quot;...It was their territorial identity and not their physical existence or even their distinct ethnic identity that the regime sought to eradicate.&quot; According to Professor Francine Hirsch, &quot;although the Soviet regime practiced politics of discrimination and exclusion, it did not practice what contemporaries thought of as &quot;racial politics&quot;.&quot; To her, these mass deportations were based on the concept that nationalities were &quot;sociohistorical groups with a shared consciousness and not racial-biological groups&quot;. In contrast to this view, Jon K. Chang contends that the deportations had been in fact based on ethnicity and that &quot;social historians&quot; in the West have failed to champion the rights of marginalized ethnicities in the Soviet Union.

===Possible motivations===
Harvard&#x27;s Terry Martin suggested a concept of &quot;Soviet xenophobia&quot;, which he defines as the ideologically motivated &quot;exaggerated Soviet fear of foreign influence and foreign contamination&quot;. This theory espouses the belief that the Soviet Union ethnically cleansed the border peoples of the USSR from 1937 to 1951 (including the Caucasus and the Crimea) to remove Soviet nationalities whose political allegiances were allegedly suspect or inimical to Soviet socialism. In this view, the USSR did not practice direct negative ethnic animus or discrimination (&quot;In neither case did the Soviet state itself conceive of these deportations as ethnic.&quot;) Political ideology of all Soviet peoples was the primary consideration. Martin stated that the various deportations of the Soviet border peoples were simply the &quot;culmination of a gradual shift from predominantly class-based terror&quot;, which began during collectivization (1932–33), to &quot;national/ethnic&quot; based terror (1937). Accordingly, Martin further claimed that the nationalities deportations were &quot;ideological, not ethnic. It was spurred by an ideological hatred and suspicion of foreign capitalist governments, not the national hatred of non-Russians.&quot; His theory entitled &quot;Soviet xenophobia&quot; paints the USSR and the Stalinist regime as having practiced and carried out in politics, education and Soviet society relatively pure socialism and Marxist practices. This view has been supported by many of the major historians of the USSR, those in Russian and even Korean studies such as Fitzpatrick, Suny, F. Hirsch, A. Weiner and A. Park. A. Park, in her archival work, found very little evidence that Koreans had proven or were able to prove their loyalties beyond a shadow of a doubt, thus &#x27;necessitating&#x27; deportation from the border areas. Robert Conquest stated that these nationalities were transferred because &quot;in Stalin&#x27;s view, either welcomed or not opposed the Germans&quot;.

In contrast, the views of J. Otto Pohl and Jon K. Chang affirm that the Soviet Union, its officials and everyday citizens produced and reproduced (from the Tsarist era) racialized (primordialist) views, policies and tropes regarding their non-Slavic peoples. Norman M. Naimark believed that the Stalinist &quot;nationalities deportations&quot; were forms of national-cultural genocide. The deportations at the very least changed the cultures, way of life and world views of the deported peoples as the majority were sent to Soviet Central Asia and Siberia.

&quot;Primordialism&quot; is simply another way of saying ethnic chauvinism or racism because the said &quot;primordial&quot; peoples or ethnic groups are seen as possessing &quot;permanent&quot; traits and characteristics, which they pass on, one generation to the next. Both Chang and Martin agree that the Stalinist regime took a turn towards primordializing nationality in the 1930s. After the &quot;primordialist turn&quot; by the Stalinist regime in the mid-1930s, the Soviet Greeks, Finns, Poles, Chinese, Koreans, Germans, Crimean Tatars and the other deported peoples were seen to have loyalties to their titular nations (or to non-Soviet polities) as the Soviet state in the 1930s regarded nationality (ethnicity) and political loyalty (ideology) as a primordial equivalents. Thus, it was no surprise that the regime would choose &quot;deportation.&quot;

Martin&#x27;s different interpretation is that the Soviet regime was not deporting the various diaspora peoples because of their nationality. Rather, nationality (ethnicity or phenotype) served as a referent or a signifier for the political ideology of the deported peoples. Amir Weiner&#x27;s argument is similar to Martin&#x27;s, substituting &quot;territorial identity&quot; for Martin&#x27;s &quot;xenophobia.&quot; The &quot;Soviet xenophobia&quot; argument also does not hold up semantically. Xenophobia is the fear by natives of invasion or loss of territory and influence to foreigners. The &quot;Russians&quot; and other Eastern Slavs are coming into the territory of the natives (the deported peoples) who were simply Soviet national minorities. They were not foreign elements. The Russian empire was not the &quot;native&quot; state, polity or government in the Asian Far East, the Caucasus and many other regions of the deported peoples. Koguryo followed by Parhae/Balhae/Bohai were the first states of the Russian Far East. John J. Stephan called the &quot;erasure&quot; of Chinese and Korean history (state-formation, cultural contributions, peoples) to the region by the USSR and Russia—the intentional &quot;genesis of a &#x27;blank spot.&#x27; &quot;

Chang notes that all forms of racism could be explained away in a like manner. Regardless, all of the Stalinist orders for &quot;total deportation&quot; of the thirteen nationalities (from 1937 to 1951) list each of the peoples by ethnicity as well as a charge of treason. Soviet law required that one&#x27;s guilt or innocence (for treason) be determined individually and in a court of law prior to sentencing (per 1936 Constitution). Finally, on the other end of the &quot;primordial&quot; spectrum, the Eastern Slavs (Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians) were seen as inherently more loyal and more representative of the Soviet people. This is clearly a deviation from socialism and Marxist–Leninism.

==Death toll==
The number of deaths attributed to deported people living in exile is considerable. The causes for such demographic catastrophe lie in harsh climates of Siberia and Kazakhstan, disease, malnutrition, work exploitation which lasted for up to 12 hours daily as well as the lack of any kind of appropriate housing or accommodation for the deported people. Overall, it is assumed that the fatalities caused by this relocation upheaval range from 800,000 up to 1,500,000.

The partial documentation in the NKVD archives indicated that the mortality rates of these deported ethnic groups were considerable. The Meskhetian Turks had a 14.6% mortality rate, the Kalmyks 17.4%, people from Crimea 19.6%, while the Chechens, the Ingush and other people from the Northern Caucasus had the highest losses reaching 23.7%. The NKVD did not record excess deaths for the deported Soviet Koreans, but their mortality rate estimates range from 10% to 16.3%.

Additionally, around 300,000–360,000 Germans deported after World War II from occupied territories in Eastern Europe perished, but the Soviet Army was not the sole perpetrator of these expulsions, since other European countries also participated.

Further development resulted from agriculture and forestry, and consolidation of the community, at the start of the 1900s, was thanks to the arrival of the railway, which for more than a century connected Hull (Gatineau) to Maniwaki. The Saint-Raphaël parish was legally constituted in 1906.

On August 19, 1921, the municipality was established when it separated from the Township Municipality of Bouchette. Although the new municipality was named after Messines, Belgium (in honour of the Canadians who fought there during World War I), it was misspelled as Messine (no &quot;s&quot;) when incorporated. It was not until 1986 when this was officially corrected. The first municipal council was elected in 1921 with Louis Lécuyer as its first mayor.

In the middle of the 20th century, Messines was very active in growing potatoes thanks to its sandy soil, ideal for extensive exploitation of this staple. For many years, an important agricultural co-operative was formed between the local and regional farmers of the day. The original main building of the co-op today houses a sawmill. During the second half of the century, the municipality’s economy gradually changed to tourism and cottagers, thanks to the presence of its magnificent lakes. Some of the more popular ones are: Blue Sea Lake, Big Cedar and Little Cedar Lakes. There are also many forested areas which allow for outdoor activities throughout the year. Today, the municipality is also known for its hunting and fishing territories, and for a wide variety of recreational activities available all year long.

<doc id="629580" wikidata="Q922297" url="?curid=629580" title="2985 Shakespeare">
<text>2985 Shakespeare (&quot;prov. designation&quot;: ) is a stony Koronian asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 12 October 1983, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell&#x27;s Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, and later named after William Shakespeare. The presumed S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 6.1 hours and measures approximately in diameter.

== Classification and orbit ==

The S-type asteroid is a member of the Koronis family, a group consisting of about 200 known bodies. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 10 months (1,756 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Goethe Link Observatory in 1962. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its identification at Crimea–Nauchnij, 7 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after William Shakespeare (1564–1616), the English renaissance dramatist and poet. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 29 September 1985 ().

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Rotation period and poles ===

Three different rotational lightcurves, obtained from photometric observations taken at the Palomar Transient Factory and a group of seven observatories, respectively, found a concurring rotation period of 6.06–6.08 hours with a brightness variation between 0.37 and 0.53 magnitude ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the space-based NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the body has an albedo of 0.26 and measures 10.5 kilometers in diameter, while the &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for members of the Koronis family of 0.24 and calculates a diameter of 10.3 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.1.

<doc id="629584" wikidata="Q187799" url="?curid=629584" title="Wally Yonamine">
<text>was a Japanese-American multi-sport athlete who played in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball.

==Early life==
Kaname Yonamine, a Nisei Japanese American, was born in Olowalu, Maui, Hawaii to parents Matsusai (September 1, 1890 – July 31, 1988) and Kikue (February 14, 1901 – February 26, 1999). Matsusai was an &quot;uchinānchu&quot; immigrant and Kikue came from Hiroshima. Yonamine attended Lahainaluna and Wallace Rider Farrington High School. The name of his high school was the origin of his nickname, originally Wallace, but quickly changed to Wally, which would later become his legal name.

==Professional football career==
Yonamine signed a $14,000 contract, playing running back for the San Francisco 49ers in their second season (1947). Doing so, he became the first football player of Japanese American ancestry to play professional football (Walter Achiu was the first Asian-American). In his one season with the team, he had 19 carries for 74 yards and caught 3 passes for 40 yards. His football career ended during the off-season, when he broke his wrist playing in an amateur baseball league in Hawaii.

==Professional baseball career==
A multi-skilled outfielder, Yonamine was also noted for his flexible batting style and aggressive baserunning during his career with the Yomiuri Giants and Chunichi Dragons. In Japan, Yonamine was a member of four Japan Series Championship teams, the Central League MVP in 1957, a consecutive seven-time Best Nine Award winner (1952–58), an eleven-time All-Star, a three-time batting champion, and the first foreigner to be a manager (Dragons, 1972–77).

Yonamine was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame, admitted in 1994 for his achievements during his 12-year career with the Giants and Dragons.

==Post-career==
Yonamine operated a highly successful pearl store, &quot;Wally Yonamine Pearls&quot;, with his wife, Jane. The store is located in Roppongi, Tokyo. They also had a branch of their store in California run by their children. In 2008, Yonamine joined the Japanese Master League team Nagoya 80 D&#x27;sers as a coach/part-time player.

After an extended battle with prostate cancer, Yonamine died on February 28, 2011, aged 85, in Honolulu.

Yonamine&#x27;s grand-nephew, Micah, was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 29th round of the 2019 Major League Baseball draft. He is currently a developmental player for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.

<doc id="629585" wikidata="Q7772019" url="?curid=629585" title="The Vandals Play Really Bad Original Country Tunes">
<text>The Vandals Play Really Bad Original Country Tunes is an album by the southern California punk rock band The Vandals, released in 1999 by Kung Fu Records. Essentially a re-release of their 1989 album &quot;Slippery When Ill&quot;, it contains 8 of the 10 songs from that album along with 2 newer, previously unavailable songs. Part of the impetus for its release was that the original &quot;Slippery When Ill&quot;, long asked for by the band&#x27;s fans, had become very rare and difficult to obtain due to the small size of the record labels it was originally released on. With their Kung Fu label (founded in 1996 by Vandals members Joe Escalante and Warren Fitzgerald) now firmly established, the band was able to re-release this music from ten years earlier in their career.

The original &quot;Slippery When Ill&quot; album represented a turning point in the history of the Vandals. It was their first album to feature Dave Quackenbush on vocals, who would remain the band&#x27;s singer throughout the rest of their career. It was also something of a departure from the punk rock formula of their previous releases, fusing a country and western style with their humorous brand of punk. The result was a sound the band called &quot;cowpunk&quot; which somewhat mocked the resurgence in popularity of country music in their native Huntington Beach. Two exceptions were the songs &quot;Shi&#x27;ite Punk&quot; and &quot;(Illa Zilla) Lady Killa,&quot; which relied heavily on scratch boxes. These songs were left off &quot;Country Tunes&quot; and replaced with the more country-sounding &quot;Play That Country Tuba, Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Complain.&quot; &quot;Shi&#x27;ite Punk&quot; was re-issued the following year on the special anniversary re-release of their album &quot;Fear of a Punk Planet&quot;.

==Lack of credits==
Although no credit is given to the performers in the album&#x27;s liner notes (except &quot;all songs written by the Vandals unless otherwise noted&quot;), the band&#x27;s 1989 lineup should be credited with making the original recordings used here, as it differed substantially from their 1999 incarnation. From the information provided in the liner notes of the original release &quot;Slippery When Ill&quot; it can be deduced that the performers on the first eight tracks of &quot;Country Tunes&quot; are Dave Quackenbush on vocals, Jan Nils Ackermann on guitar, Robbie Allen on bass, and Joe Escalante on drums.

Mininmal credits are given for the last two songs on the album. Stan Freese is credited as the writer of &quot;Play That Country Tuba, Cowboy&quot;, which is a re-recording of a song he performed on Hee-Haw. He is the father of Josh Freese, drummer for the Vandals since 1990, and is also an accomplished tuba player who contributed to the band&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Hitler Bad, Vandals Good&quot;. He sings and plays tuba on the song, although it is unclear who provided the rest of the musicianship and backing vocals. Likewise no credit is given for &quot;Complain,&quot; except that it is &quot;from the film &quot;Bob Roberts&quot;&quot;. &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; is the title of a 1992 movie starring, written and directed by Tim Robbins, in which he plays a right-wing folk singer running for political office. &quot;Complain&quot; is one of the songs performed by Robbins in the film, and it is covered on this album by the Vandals. Based on the dates of the film and of the band&#x27;s involvement with the Freese family, it is most likely that the band&#x27;s lineup of Dave Quackenbush, Warren Fitzgerald, Joe Escalante and Josh Freese (a lineup which has remained intact since 1990) should receive credit for the performances on these last two songs. However, no specific recording or production information is given.

<doc id="629587" wikidata="Q17110533" url="?curid=629587" title="Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Ministry of Works was a department of the UK Government formed in 1940, during the Second World War, to organise the requisitioning of property for wartime use. After the war, the ministry retained responsibility for government building projects.

In 1962 it was renamed the Ministry of Public Building and Works, and acquired the extra responsibility of monitoring the building industry as well as taking over the works departments from the War Office, Air Ministry and Admiralty. The chief architect of the ministry from 1951 to 1970 was Eric Bedford. In 1970 the ministry was absorbed into the Department of the Environment (DoE), although from 1972 most former works functions were transferred to the largely autonomous Property Services Agency (PSA). Subsequent reorganisation of PSA into Property Holdings was followed by abolition in 1996 when individual government departments took on responsibility for managing their own estate portfolios.

==History==
The tradition of building specific structures for military or governmental use began to break down at the time of the First World War, when the unprecedented need for armaments prompted the rapid construction of factories in English locations where a skilled workforce was not easily recruited.

===Precedents===

The department originally derived from the Office of Works (the King&#x27;s Works) responsible only for royal properties (1378–1832) which became the Office of Woods, Forest, Land Revenues and Works (1832–1852). The Office of Works was founded in 1851 and became the Ministry of Works in 1940.

This became the Ministry of Works &amp; Planning (1942–43), the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (MHLG) 1951–62, and the Ministry of Public Building and Works (1962–70) before being subsumed in the Department of the Environment in 1970 and English Heritage in 1984. 

===Housing===
Architect Frank Baines (1877–1933) guided the rapid development of estates of houses, mainly in a terraced style, for workers and their families in places close to the required factories and depots. Examples included the Well Hall garden suburb south of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich (between Eltham and Shooters Hill), Aeroville near the Grahame-White aeroplane factory at Hendon, and the Roe Green estate at Stag Lane in the London Borough of Brent.

Considering the pace of their construction, these estates were surprisingly picturesque and were subsequently considered superior in scenic terms to many estates of municipal housing that followed in the peacetime of the 1920s, guided by the Tudor Walters Committee report of 1919 and the Housing and Town Planning Act 1919.

Their styling owed much to the English garden suburb tradition (seen at Bournville, Letchworth, Saltaire, Port Sunlight and Welwyn Garden City) and garden areas and front boundaries were generally more varied than on contemporary estates within military bases where state ownership endured over a longer period. More modern examples include a large estate near central Malvern built 1952–1953 for the scientists and personnel of TRE. The styling, though more upmarket, resembled the typical council estates of semi-detached houses being built around the UK during the post-war years. By the late 20th century the Well Hall example had become known as the Progress Estate.

===Monuments===

From the 1880s the Office of Works was also responsible for the upkeep of ancient monuments, a role later taken on by the Department of the Environment and later, when responsibility for heritage matters was devolved, in 1977, by English Heritage and the other home country heritage organisations. As such it forms the basis for any research into official or historic structures ranging from post offices to palaces and all archaeological sites in state care, including Stonehenge. In conjunction with the Foreign Office it also was responsible for the fabric of British embassies and consulates across the world. Apart from English Heritage, Historic Scotland and Cadw, its vast archive is dispersed throughout many other organisations including national museums and galleries, other government departments including the Government Art Collection and the now hived-off agencies covering royal parks and palaces. 

Virtually every record office, every museum and every town council in the British Isles will hold files relating to the MOW who in 1947 enabled the first &#x27;lists&#x27; defining and protecting historic buildings which now forms the heritage protection of over 400,000 sites. A detailed history of offices and staff remains to be written: the work of the almost completely anonymous civil servants who worked for this very large government department is largely absent from published or online sources unless these manifold official activities impinge on current specialised research on the military, archaeological or architectural links.

==Origins==
The Ministry of Works descended from a long line of offices with responsibilities for managing royal and then governmental property. These are summarised below.

*1378–1832 Office of Works. This office was established to oversee the building and maintenance of Crown property such as royal castles and residences.
*1832–1851 Office of Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, Works and Buildings. The Office of Works continued to operate as the Works Department within the larger office.
*1851–1940 Office of Works. The office was given a separate identity in order to bring it under the direct control of Parliament.
*1940–1942 Ministry of Works and Buildings. The ministry was formed during the Second World War as the government&#x27;s need for new buildings and the conversion of existing buildings became more urgent.
*1942–1943 Ministry of Works and Planning.
*1943–1962 Ministry of Works.
*1962–1970 Ministry of Public Building and Works.

<doc id="629590" wikidata="Q1261521" url="?curid=629590" title="Switchboard operator">
<text>In the early days of telephony, companies used manual telephone switchboards, and switchboard operators connected calls by inserting a pair of phone plugs into the appropriate jacks. They were gradually phased out and replaced by automated systems, first those allowing direct dialing within a local area, then for long-distance and international direct dialing.

==Description==
A typical manual telephone switchboard has a vertical panel containing an array of jacks with a desk in front. The desk has a row of switches and two rows of plugs attached to cables that retract into the desk when not in use. Each pair of plugs was part of a cord circuit with a switch associated that let the operator participate in the call or ring the circuit for an incoming call. Each jack had a light above it that lit when the customer&#x27;s telephone receiver was lifted (the earliest systems required the customer to hand-crank a magneto to alert the central office and, later, to &quot;ring off&quot; the completed call). Lines from the central office were usually arranged along the bottom row. Before the advent of operator distance dialing and customer direct dial (DDD) calling, a switchboard operator would work with their counterparts in distant central office to complete long-distance calls. Switchboard operators are typically required to have very strong communication skills.

Before the advent of automatic exchanges, an operator&#x27;s assistance was required for anything other than calling telephones across a shared party line. Callers spoke to an operator at a central office who then connected a cord to the proper circuit in order to complete the call. Being in complete control of the call, the operator was in a position to listen to private conversations. Automatic, or dial, systems were developed in the 1920s to reduce labor costs as usage increased, and to ensure privacy to the customer. As phone systems became more sophisticated, less direct intervention by the telephone operator was necessary to complete calls. With the development of computerized telephone dialing systems, many telephone calls which previously required live operators could be placed directly by calling parties without additional human intervention.

As well as the people that were employed by the public networks, operators were required at private branch exchanges (PBX) to answer incoming calls and connect them to the correct extensions. Today, most large organizations have &quot;direct inward dialing&quot;, or &quot;direct dial-in&quot;. Smaller workplaces may have an automated system which allows callers to enter the extension number of the called party, or a receptionist who answers calls and performs operator duties. Depending on the employment setting, the roles and level of responsibilities of a PBX operator can vary greatly, from performing wake-up calls in a hotel to coordinating emergency responses, dispatching, and overhead paging in hospitals. Operators employed in healthcare settings may have other duties, such as data entry, greeting patients and visitors, taking messages, triaging, or performing after-hours answering service. Experienced, well-trained operators generally command higher salaries.

==History==

In January 1878 George Willard Croy became the world&#x27;s first telephone operator when he started working for the Boston Telephone Dispatch company.
Emma Nutt became the first female telephone operator on 1 September 1878 when she started working for the Boston Telephone Dispatch company, because the attitude and behaviour of the teenage boys previously employed as operators was unacceptable. Emma was hired by Alexander Graham Bell and, reportedly, could remember every number in the telephone directory of the New England Telephone Company. More women began to replace men within this sector of the workforce for several reasons. The companies observed that women were generally more courteous to callers, and women&#x27;s labor was cheap in comparison to men&#x27;s. Specifically, women were paid from one half to one quarter of a man&#x27;s salary.
In the United States, any switchboard operator employed by any independently owned public telephone company with no more than seven hundred fifty stations were excluded from the Equal Pay Act of 1963.

Harriot Daley became the first telephone switchboard operator at the United States Capitol in 1898.

Julia O&#x27;Connor, a former telephone operator, led the Telephone Operators&#x27; Strike of 1919 and the Telephone Operators&#x27; Strike of 1923 against New England Telephone Company on behalf of the IBEW Telephone Operators&#x27; Department for better wages and working conditions. In the 1919 strike, after five days, Postmaster General Burleson agreed to negotiate an agreement between the union and the telephone company, resulting in an increase in pay for the operators and recognition of the right to bargain collectively. However, the 1923 strike was called off after less than a month without achieving any of its goals.

In 1983, in Bryant Pond, Maine, Susan Glines became the last switchboard operator for a hand-crank phone when that exchange was converted. Manual central office switchboards continued in operation at rural points like Kerman, California, and Wanaaring, New South Wales, as late as 1991, but these were central-battery systems with no hand-cranked magnetos.

According to a 2024 study, the mechanization of switchboard operations harmed the economic outcomes of incumbent telephone operators, but did not harm the employment prospects of young women overall, as future cohorts of young women entered into other growing economic sectors.

==Reality and fiction==

Before the 1960s, the telephone exchange with telephone switchboards and operators played a crucial role in connecting phone calls. A telephone switchboard is a device that allows telephone lines to be interconnected, enabling the routing of calls between different phones or phone networks. The switchboard operator was a person who manually connected calls by plugging and unplugging cords on the switchboard. The role of the switchboard and operator was important because they were responsible for connecting callers with the correct party and ensuring that calls were completed correctly. They also provided assistance with making long-distance calls, directory assistance, and other services related to the use of the telephone network. Dial phones were invented in the 1930s but took years to become standard. New Hampshire switched to dials town by town from 1950 to 1973. Switchboards and operators were an integral part of the telecommunications system until the introduction of electronic switching systems in the mid-20th century.

Dorothy M. Johnson, who later became a famous writer, started as a part-time relief operator at age 14 in Whitefish, Montana, in the early 1920s. It was attractive opportunity for ambitious young women in a small logging town out West who needed money for college. The role demanded quick decision-making, meticulous attention to detail, a very good memory for names, and the ability to handle criticism. Switchboard technology was a physically demanding task, involving numerous plugs, keys, lights, connecting cords, and complicated protocols for establishing connections. The full-time operators were on duty 56 hours per week, and while they often grumbled about being overworked by a harsh boss, they were reasonably compensated at $50 a month.

While many of the functions of the switchboard and operator have been automated, telephone operators still play a role in some contexts, such as in emergency services or customer support centers. Thus according to a 1995 study by Muller et al., the operators who provide directory assistance, &quot;serve as experts in a variety of domains of relevance to their customers&#x27; lives, helping them to navigate through government agencies, complex business hierarchies, partially remembered geographies, and dynamic changes in their customers&#x27; worlds.&quot;

The most famous group of American operators were in the &quot;Women of the Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit&quot; of the American Expeditionary Forces in 1917–1919. They were bilingual female switchboard operators sent to France in the World War I. The 223 women were known informally as Hello Girls and were not formally recognized for their military service until 1978.

In actuality, operators were rule-followers, but according to April Middeljans, in American drama, film, and magazines, they were often portrayed as rule-breaking rebels who challenged societal norms. Through disaster tales, detective stories, and romantic comedies, fiction writers suggest that operators were not just controlled by society, but rather played an active role in regulating it and shaping the lives of their clients and themselves. The female protagonists in these stories were motivated by their curiosity and empathy, and valued human connections over automated ones. By utilizing the switchboard&#x27;s power, they aimed to achieve their own ideals of societal betterment. These stories reflect a deep admiration for strong female leads and a preference for human ingenuity and decision-making over machine efficiency.

<doc id="629599" wikidata="Q912212" url="?curid=629599" title="Kismet (robot)">
<text>Kismet is a robot head which was made in the 1990s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (&quot;MIT&quot;) by Dr. Cynthia Breazeal as an experiment in affective computing; a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. The name Kismet comes from a Turkish word meaning &quot;fate&quot; or sometimes &quot;luck&quot;.

== Hardware design and construction ==
In order for Kismet to properly interact with human beings, it contains input devices that give it auditory, visual, and proprioception abilities. Kismet simulates emotion through various facial expressions, vocalizations, and movement. Facial expressions are created through movements of the ears, eyebrows, eyelids, lips, jaw, and head. The cost of physical materials was an estimated US$25,000.

In addition to the equipment mentioned above, there are four Motorola 68332s, nine 400 MHz PCs, and another 500 MHz PC.

== Software system ==
Kismet&#x27;s social intelligence software system, or synthetic nervous system (SNS), was designed with human models of intelligent behavior in mind. It contains six subsystems as follows.

===Low-level feature extraction system===
This system processes raw visual and auditory information from cameras and microphones. Kismet&#x27;s vision system can perform eye detection, motion detection and, albeit controversial, skin-color detection. Whenever Kismet moves its head, it momentarily disables its motion detection system to avoid detecting self-motion. It also uses its stereo cameras to estimate the distance of an object in its visual field, for example to detect threats—large, close objects with a lot of movement.

Kismet&#x27;s audio system is mainly tuned towards identifying affect in infant-directed speech. In particular, it can detect five different types of affective speech: approval, prohibition, attention, comfort, and neutral. The affective intent classifier was created as follows. Low-level features such as pitch mean and energy (volume) variance were extracted from samples of recorded speech. The classes of affective intent were then modeled as a gaussian mixture model and trained with these samples using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Classification is done with multiple stages, first classifying an utterance into one of two general groups (e.g. soothing/neutral vs. prohibition/attention/approval) and then doing more detailed classification. This architecture significantly improved performance for hard-to-distinguish classes, like &quot;approval&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re a clever robot&quot;) versus &quot;attention&quot; (&quot;Hey Kismet, over here&quot;).

===Motivation system===
Dr. Breazeal figures her relations with the robot as &#x27;something like an infant-caretaker interaction, where I&#x27;m the caretaker essentially, and the robot is like an infant&#x27;. The overview sets the human-robot relation within a frame of learning, with Dr. Breazeal providing the scaffolding for Kismet&#x27;s development. It offers a demonstration of Kismet&#x27;s capabilities, narrated as emotive facial expressions that communicate the robot&#x27;s &#x27;motivational state&#x27;, Dr. Breazeal: &quot;This one is anger (laugh) extreme anger, disgust, excitement, fear, this is happiness, this one is interest, this one is sadness, surprise, this one is tired, and this one is sleep.&quot;

At any given moment, Kismet can only be in one emotional state at a time. However, Breazeal states that Kismet is not conscious, so it does not have feelings.

===Motor system===
Kismet speaks a proto-language with a variety of phonemes, similar to a baby&#x27;s babbling. It uses the DECtalk voice synthesizer, and changes pitch, timing, articulation, etc. to express various emotions. Intonation is used to vary between question and statement-like utterances. Lip synchronization was important for realism, and the developers used a strategy from animation: &quot;simplicity is the secret to successful lip animation.&quot; Thus, they did not try to imitate lip motions perfectly, but instead &quot;create a visual shorthand that passes unchallenged by the viewer.&quot;

<doc id="629600" wikidata="Q4241510" url="?curid=629600" title="Exsanguination">
<text>Exsanguination is the loss of blood from the circulatory system of a vertebrate, usually leading to death. The word comes from the Latin &#x27;sanguis&#x27;, meaning blood, and the prefix &#x27;ex-&#x27;, meaning &#x27;out of&#x27;.

Exsanguination has long been used as a method of animal slaughter. Humane slaughter must ensure the animal is rendered insensible to pain, whether through a captive bolt or other process, prior to the bloodletting.

Depending upon the health of the individual, a person usually dies from losing half to two-thirds of their blood; a loss of roughly one-third of the blood volume is considered very serious. Even a single deep cut can warrant suturing and hospitalization, especially if trauma, a vein or artery, or another comorbidity is involved. In the past, bloodletting was a common medical procedure or therapy, now rarely used in medicine.

== Slaughtering of animals ==

Exsanguination is used as a slaughter method. Before the fatal incision is made, the animal will be rendered insensible to pain by various methods, including captive bolt, electricity, or chemical. Electricity is used mostly to incapacitate swine, poultry, and domestic sheep, whereas a chemical is used for injured livestock.

Without prior sedation, stunning, or anesthetic, this method of slaughter may cause a high degree of anxiety, depending on the process. How animals are handled and restrained before slaughter likely impacts their welfare more than whether or not they are stunned. If done badly, there can be a large element of cruelty involved, whereas killing under the correct conditions minimizes the pain or suffering, if any, inflicted upon the animal.

Continued pumping operation of the heart during exsanguination increases the rate of depletion and thus hastens death by raising the fluid pressure of the blood. Because the heart operates like a positive displacement pump, blood volume reduction will not affect cardiac output efficiency. Deprivation of blood to the heart does gradually result in diminished function, but concurrently with similar death of other parts in the body as blood volume declines.

Quickly after the animal is incapacitated, a very sharp knife, in an orientation parallel to the ground, is inserted through the skin just in front of the point of the jaw and below the vertebrate. From this position, the knife is drawn forward away from the spine to sever the jugular veins, carotid arteries, and trachea. Properly performed, blood will flow freely, and death will occur within seconds. Sheep and duck will reach heart and liver malfunction, leading to death, in under 10 seconds; larger animals, notably cattle, may take up to 40 seconds to reach brain death. This period may extend to a couple of minutes if complications, such as arterial occlusion, occur. However, the animal&#x27;s inverted position allows blood to flow more precipitously, thus making it highly unlikely for an animal to regain consciousness before it is fully exsanguinated. In any case, animal welfare advisory councils clearly emphasize that the time from incapacitation to the start of exsanguination should be prompt, recommending a time under 15 seconds.

Beyond the initial cost of purchasing a captive bolt, continued usage of the method is very inexpensive. The animal is incapacitated for the duration of the procedure, so it is one of the safest methods for the slaughterer.

===In Jewish and Islamic slaughter===
Jewish &quot;kashrut&quot; (kosher) and Islamic &quot;dhabihah&quot; (halal) dietary laws mandate that slaughter is performed with a cut that immediately severs the esophagus, trachea, and the large blood vessels in the neck, causing loss of consciousness and death by exsanguination. The double-edged pointed knife is prohibited. Instead, a long knife with a squared-off end is used that, in Jewish law, must be at least twice the width of the animal&#x27;s neck. The operation of sticking or exsanguination is executed faster than when using the pointed knife, as four large blood vessels in the neck are severed simultaneously.

In Islamic and Jewish law, captive bolts and other methods of pre-slaughter paralysis are not permissible, as consumption of animals found dead are regarded as carrion and stunned animals that are later killed fall into this category. Various halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed fail-safe system of head-only stunning using a mushroom-shaped hammerhead that delivers a blow that is not fatal, proved by it being possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock.

Such methods, particularly involving unstunned animals, have been criticized by veterinarians and animal welfare organizations, among others. Prohibitions against unstunned slaughter have been enacted in several countries. See Animal welfare controversies in shechita for further information.

== Suicide ==
Some methods of suicide, e.g., wrist slitting, rely on exsanguination as the mechanism of death.

Latham was born with the surname Lathan in Norwich, and changed his name in order to distinguish himself from his elder brother, who also had a political career. He worked as a Railway Clerk there, and later moved to London where he became involved in Trade Union activities. He helped to form the London Labour Party in 1914, and was President of the National Union of Clerks in 1916. During World War I he fought in France with the Royal Sussex Regiment.

==Elected office==
Latham had retrained as an accountant and continued his involvement in London politics, fighting the general elections of 1922 and 1923 in Hendon. His administrative skill and knowledge of transport issues led to his selection as a County Alderman on the London County Council in 1928. This brought him into close contact with Herbert Morrison, the Labour Leader on the LCC and Minister of Transport in the Labour government from 1929. Latham was a strong personal supporter of Morrison with whom he agreed on most issues (especially financial orthodoxy), and with Morrison&#x27;s support, he was elected again to the London Executive.

In the 1934 election Latham gave up his seat as an Alderman for an elected Councillor at Hackney South, again using Morrison&#x27;s influence (Morrison had been Mayor and MP for Hackney). Labour won a majority and Latham was appointed as Chair of the Finance Committee, which both Morrison and Latham agreed should make sure that taxation was kept as low as possible. This work was seen to be successful when Labour were re-elected in 1937.

On 16 January 1942 he was created Baron Latham, of Hendon in the County of Middlesex.

When Morrison was appointed to the Government in the wartime Coalition, he chose Latham as his successor as leader of the council. He was elected leader of the Council in May 1940. The circumstances of the time made civil defence of London the top priority for the council, and normal party politics were suspended. The council had a large share of the responsibility for Air Raid Precautions (it ran the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service) and it was the biggest hospital authority in the country. Latham took the chairmanship of the Civil Defence Committee for himself.

However, Latham did not ignore political issues during the war. He instigated a Labour Party inquiry into the structure of London government for the post-war period, which was an attempt to settle and justify his preferred policy of creating a Greater London Authority covering a much wider area. This was a highly controversial policy within the party, and two members of the committee drawing up the report voted against it, with four others unable to agree on the distribution of powers between various local government bodies.

After the end of the war Latham won the 1946 election in a landslide, following other large Labour victories at the General election and in municipal elections. However his relationship with the Labour group deteriorated with many complaints about lack of consultation and excessive discipline. Although this was characteristic of all Labour leaders of the LCC, Latham did not have the personality or the stature to overcome it. On 15 July 1947, Latham announced his resignation &#x27;for personal reasons&#x27;. It is often held to be significant that his successor, Isaac Hayward, was one of those who had voted against his plan for a Greater London Authority, and Hayward&#x27;s Chief Whip was the other.

He appears in the film &quot;The Proud City&quot; discussing the Abercrombie plans for the redevelopment of London after the war.

==London Transport Executive==
Latham had served on the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) since 1935, and, within a month of his resignation as Leader of the LCC, his appointment as chairman of the London Transport Executive (LTE), which was to replace the LPTB from 1 January 1948, was announced by the Labour Government on 20 August 1947. Latham&#x27;s appointment had been predicted in a House of Commons debate on the Transport Act on 24 July by MP Henry Strauss, and the coincidence of these two events provoked considerable comment and suggestions of a fix, but the Minister for Transport denied that he had had any contact with Latham.

Lord Ashfield, chairman of the outgoing LPTB, resigned the post on 31 October 1947, and Latham filled the role temporarily until the Board was abolished at the end of that year. As chairman of the LTE, Latham welcomed in London&#x27;s last tram in the early hours of 6 July 1952. Latham served as Chairman for six years.

==Later career==
He was made a peer from 1942 (when he was LCC Leader) and held public appointments later on the Metropolitan Water Board and the Standing Advisory Committee on Pay of the Higher Civil Service. He was Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex from 1945 to 1956.

He died in London in 1970, at the age of 81. His probate was sworn that year at . His usual address was given as in Montagu Square, Marylebone.

==Personal life==
Charles Latham was married twice.

Firstly, to Maya Helen Allman, on 14 June 1913. They were later divorced.
They had four children:
* Francis Charles Allman Latham b. 24 Jan 1917, d. Nov 1959
* Barbara Wendy Latham b. 7 Jan 1920
* Jean Helen Latham b. 17 Jul 1921
* Diana Dorothy Latham b. 18 Sep 1925.

On 28 March 1957 he married Sylvia May Kennard (died 1985).

<text>Jean-François Hamtramck (or John Francis Hamtramck; 1756 – 11 April 1803) was a Canadian-born Continental Army officer during the American Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War. In the Revolution, he participated in the Invasion of Quebec, the Sullivan Expedition, and the Siege of Yorktown. In the history of United States expansion into the Northwest Territory, Hamtramck is connected to 18th century forts at modern Midwest cities such as Steubenville, Vincennes, Fort Wayne, and Detroit. The city of Hamtramck, Michigan is named for him.

==Life and career==
Hamtramck was born on 1756, in Montreal, Canada (then part of New France). He was the son of Charles David Hamtramck, a barber who had immigrated from Trier, Germany (born in Luxembourg), and Canadian Marie Anne Bertin. Hamtramck was baptized in the Catholic Church in August 1756. By the time the American Revolution came to Canada, he was fluent in French, English, German, and Latin.

===American Revolution===

====Canada====
When General Montgomery&#x27;s forces invaded Canada, the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston was formed. Hamtramck, age 19, joined on 15 September 1775 and was appointed as regimental commissary. He worked closely with Livingston to supply the new regiment, and was with them when Fort Chambly was captured. 

As the regiment moved into Quebec, Hamtramck remained in Montreal to gather supplies, and was appointed by Montgomery to deputy commissary in the Continental Army. The United States was defeated and Montgomery killed at the Battle of Quebec, however. Hamtramck helped raise 26 new recruits and was appointed as their captain. However, Moses Hazen filled other units with his recruits and reduced Hamtramck to lieutenant, leading 10 French Canadians in a New Hampshire regiment under Colonel Timothy Bedel. 

In this regiment, Hamtramck participated in the Battle of the Cedars. On 19 May 1776, Hamtramck was captured after Lieutenant Isaac Butterfield surrendered to British Captain George Forster. Iroquois warriors with Forster entered the barracks and killed three men, then stole the belongings of the rest. Captain Forster considered the French Canadians to be traitors and ordered them put in irons. Hamtramck protested that he be treated as an officer. Forster released Hamtramck from his shackles, but refused to return his clothing or release the enlisted men. After capturing more prisoners the next day, Forster had them held on the Island of Montreal. In early June, however, Forster was threatened by American forces under Benedict Arnold, and he marched his company and prisoners to Lake St. Lawrence. Finding no room for the prisoners on the boats there, Forster abandoned them on the shore. They soon broke free from their shackles, and Hamtramck led his unclothed men on a 4 day trek to Montreal, arriving on 8 June, as Arnold was evacuating. Hamtramck located Colonel Hazen, who dismissed the French Canadians to return to their homes.

Hamtramck was warned that he would be considered a traitor if captured, so he travelled to the United States with the defeated army. In July 1776, he travelled to Philadelphia to testify before a Congressional committee investigating the losses in Canada. Hamtramck submitted a four page letter describing his experience, in French, to Congress. On 10 August, Congress passed a resolution that both granted &quot;John Hamptrenk&quot; $350 for his services in Canada and recognized his rank as Captain.

====United States====
=====New York=====
Captain Hamtramck settled briefly with other French Canadian refugees in Esopus, New York. When the new 5th New York Regiment was created under Colonel Lewis DuBois, Hamtramck appealed for one of the open company commands. He also received the endorsements of Colonel Livingston and Colonel Peter Gansevoort, among others. On 17 March 1777, the New Nork Committee of Arrangements gave him command of 7th Company, 5th New York Regiment, dated from 21 November 1776. He reported to Fort Montgomery, where Colonel Hazen found him and charged &quot;Lieut. John Hamtramck&quot; of desertion in the Canadian campaign. Hamtramck demanded a court-martial. The charges were reviewed by General Horatio Gates, who found so many inconsistencies in Hazen&#x27;s charges that he dismissed them and ordered Hamtramck to report to Colonel Dubois.

Hamtramck reported again to Fort Montgomery, then under the command of General George Clinton. The enlisted stationed at Fort Montgomery challenged him as a young, French speaking officer, but he quickly earned a reputation as a strict disciplinarian, which earned him the respect of General (soon Governor) Clinton. That October, he escaped from Fort Montgomery when it was overrun by the British, swinging a broken musket to clear his path. Half the regiment had been captured, however, leaving Hamtramck again without a unit. He found Colonel Dubois and travelled with other escapees to warn Governor Clinton. That November, following British General Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender, Hamtramck worked to reorganize and supply 7th Company at New Windsor. 

In March 1778, Hamtramck was called as a witness in the courts-martial investigations of Generals Putnam and Clinton. That Spring, the regiment was ordered to White Plains. Although Hamtramck remained with his company, he was too ill to report for duty until September. That Winter he distributed a portion of his company supplies to aid survivors of the Cherry Valley massacre.

In 1779, Hamtramck led his depleted company in the Sullivan Expedition. On 29 August, Hamtramck fought in the Battle of Newtown, charging with the 5th New York Regiment to relieve Colonel George Reid&#x27;s 2nd New Hampshire Regiment. That Winter, Hamtramck encamped at Morristown with the rest of the Continental Army. In February 1780, he signed a petition with 65 New York officers, regarding the depreciation of currency. It asked that either their pay be increased, or their resignations accepted. Washington acknowledged their situation but refused to accept their resignations. By May, Hamtramck was the senior officer in the 5th New York Regiment, which had only 10 officers remaining. They petitioned Congress to keep the Regiment together.

In response to movements by Wilhelm von Knyphausen, the New York Brigade under General James Clinton marched North to defend the Hudson Valley. The 5th New York Regiment, part of the brigade, established their defense in the area surrounding Fonda, New York. In late June they regiments consolidated at West Point, where the 5th Regiment received a new commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Marinus Willett. At the end of July, the regiment moved to Peekskill, New York, where they were reorganized into a light infantry regiment in a new Division under command of General Lafayette. In this new role they marched the rest of the Summer throughout New York and New Jersey, always with bayonets fixed. In October, the regiment was sent to reinforce West Point again; by this time General Arnold&#x27;s treason had been discovered.

The New York Brigade was consolidated into two regiments. Colonel Philip Van Cortlandt was given command of the 2nd New York Regiment and selected to keep Captain Hamtramck while excess officers were dismissed. In February 1781, a woodcutting party from Hamtramck&#x27;s company was attacked by a scouting party under Joseph Brant outside Fort Schuyler, killing Private William Moffet and capturing the others.

That May, Fort Schuyler caught fire, destroying the barracks and most of the fort. Hamtramck was appointed to investigate the fire, No sign of arson was found, but the fort had to be abandoned, so the regiment regarrisoned at Fort Herkimer.

=====Yorktown and the End of the War=====
That July, Hamtramck&#x27;s company was marched to Dobbs Ferry, New York and incorporated into a light infantry battalion commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton. They were marched to the Siege of Yorktown, where Hamtramck&#x27;s company was the first to occupy an American trench parallel to the British defenses. Under Major Nicholas Fish, Hamtramck led his company in Hamilton&#x27;s assault on Redoubt 10. That November, Hamtramck&#x27;s company returned North, escorting prisoners from Yorktown. They wintered at Pompton, New Jersey, unaware that for them, the war was effectively over.

In order to alleviate boredom that Winter, Hamtramck submitted a plan to capture a nearby British post on Bergen Neck. The plan made it all the way to General Washington, who wrote to Hamtramck, disapproving the plan but offering his compliments. Washington and his wife visited the encamped Soldiers that March. General von Steuben inspected the battalion in April and was delighted with their performance.

That Autumn 1782, Hamtramck&#x27;s company was at full strength, and ordered to the Peekskills to establish a screen against possible British movements. They spent that Winter at New Windsor, New York. He completed his final muster and dismissed his company on 21 May 1783. Without a home in the United States, Hamtramck remained at New Windsor, and unsuccessfully petitioned to remain in the Army. Hamtramck served until 3 June 1783. He was brevet promoted to major at the time of his discharge. That same year, he was among the original members of the New York State Society of the Cincinnati. 

Hamtramck petitioned Thomas Mifflin, then the president of Congress, for a position in the newly suggested &quot;Peace Establishment&quot;, since he could not return to his home in Canada. His name was among the officers recommended by Washington for this force.

===Northwest Indian War===
====First American Regiment====

On 12 April 1785, with recommendations from three New York generals as well as George Washington, Hamtramck was again appointed as a Captain. This time he served in the First American Regiment, the only standing army remaining from the Continental Army of the American Revolution. In 1786, he was sent from Fort Pitt in command of 160 Soldiers to protect surveyors and remove illegal settlers at Mingo Bottom. That October, he was promoted to major. Hamtramck had Fort Steuben constructed here to aid in the dual mission, completing the fort in early 1787. He had each of the three companies under his command construct one blockhouse in a competition where the first to complete construction would be issued six gallons of whiskey, while the last to complete would dig the ditches. The fort later became the site of Steubenville, Ohio. During this period of initial fort building, Hamtramck wrote that the small army depended on &quot;Providence which by the way, can be depended on more than the Contractor&quot;.

=====Vincennes=====
In 1787, Hamtramck travelled with the newly promoted General Josiah Harmar to Vincennes in the Illinois Country. The U.S. officers made a treaty with local Native American tribes. Harmar then continued west, leaving Major Hamtramck in command of 95 Soldiers at Fort Patrick Henry. Hamtramck constructed a new fort, which Harmar later wrote and directed to be named Fort Knox, after United States Secretary of War Henry Knox. 

In 1788, Hamtramck requested leave to visit New York. Harmar denied his request. In August of that year, about 60 Kentucky militia led by Patrick Brown arrived in Vincennes, seeking revenge against Native Americans. Hamtramck ordered him to return to Kentucky, since peaceful tribes were &quot;under the protection of the United States&quot;. Hamtramck reported to Harmar that he was powerless to stop Brown because he had &quot;but nine men fit for duty&quot;. 

The following year, a detachment of 36 men was attacked near the mouth of the Wabash River, killing 10 and wounding 8. A raiding party led by John Hardin killed a Shawnee party north of Vincennes that same year. The Kentucky raiders paraded their scalp trophies through Vincennes, where Hamtramck lamented that the &quot;provocation&quot; caused &quot;the authority of the United States&quot; to be &quot;so much insulted&quot;. He feared that the &quot;this Kentucky affair will end everything&quot; and that Vincennes would pay for their raid.

Due to the lack of U.S. officials, Hamtramck became the de facto government representative in the Vincennes region. His bilingual skills made him effective both with U.S. settlers and the local French speaking residents, with whom Hamtramck was also popular due to his Catholic faith. Hamtramck remained as commander of the fort at Vincennes until 1791. He was successful in negotiating a suspension of hostilities between the Wabash nations and Vincennes. While serving at Vincennes, he met William Wells, an adopted member of the Miami, and informed his family in Kentucky of his residence. This led to a reunion between Wells and his brothers, although he chose to remain with the Miami.

=====1790=====
In 1790, Hamtramck was sent a speech by Governor of the Northwest Territory, Arthur St. Clair, which proposed peace. Hamtramck sent copies in French and English to the Wabash nations first by Pierre Gamelin, then by his brother Antoine Gamelin. Blue Jacket responded that the British at Fort Detroit must be consulted, and several Native Americans expressed skepticism that the peace proposal was meant &quot;to take away by degrees&quot; the native lands. Hamtramck reported the rejection to General Harmar, concluding &quot;a war seems inevitable&quot;. A delegation of Potawatomi and Miami arrived later in the year. Hamtramck informed them that the governor was no longer in the region to negotiate, and told them to return with all their prisoners if they were sincere.

In August 1790, Hamtramck married Marie Josèphe Edeline, a resident of Vincennes and widow of Nicolas Perrot. They had 3 daughters together. As a reward for his service in the American Revolutionary War, Hamtramck chose bounty lands on the Wabash and Illinois Rivers.

Major Hamtramck was ordered to move that Autumn against Indian villages on the Wabash, Vermilion, and Eel rivers to create a distraction from the main campaign led by General Josiah Harmar. The Hamtramck expedition consisted of his own garrison, with militia from the local French residents and Kentucky. The total force was about 300 men. On 10 October, they arrived at an empty village near the Vermilion River, but lacked the supplies to continue on to more villages with the full force. In addition, several members of both the militia and the Kentucky force had deserted, and Hamtramck knew they were being tracked by Native American warriors. Anticipating a &quot;severe drubbing&quot; if they continued, Hamtramck returned to Vincennes, losing horses to hostile forces along the way and arriving on 26 October 1790. Hamtramck thought his mission had been a failure, but he later learned later that a force of 600 warriors from the Wabash Confederacy- nearly double the size of his own force- had assembled to fight. Hamtramck considered the Wabash force evidence that his primary mission had been accomplished.

That December, General Von Steuben wrote to Alexander Hamilton, &quot;I still fear for Hamtramck. This war is not over, it is only the Commencement of the Hostilities, so will we never learn to be wise that by force of stupidity?&quot;

=====St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat=====

The following year, Lieutenant Abner Prior relieved Hamtramck as commandant at Vincennes. Hamtramck was ordered to report to Fort Washington with his detachment. They arrived on 15 July 1791, and were sent to Ludlow&#x27;s Station, 6 miles north of Fort Washington. Major Hamtramck was placed in command of the First American Regiment, with Major David Ziegler as his second in command. They served under General Arthur St. Clair, who was leading a new campaign along the same route Harmar had followed the previous year. Hamtramck selected the site and oversaw the construction of an advance post, named Fort Hamilton. While there, he received a letter from Lieutenant Prior, warning that a large body of Native Americans would oppose St. Clair&#x27;s march northward.

St. Clair ordered Hamtramck and First American Regiment to the rear in order to protect supply trains and catch deserters. On 4 November 1791, they heard cannon fire in the distance, and Hamtramck led the regiment on a &quot;brisk pace&quot; to catch the main body. They encountered Kentucky militia fleeing from St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat, who informed them that the entire army had been destroyed. Hamtramck ordered a detachment forward to find the main army, then sent the majority of his command to secure Fort Jefferson, which he presumed would be the next target. The forward detachment made contact with leading elements of St. Clair&#x27;s retreat and escorted them back to Fort Jefferson, which by nightfall was too crowded for additional refugees. Hamtramck was later criticized by Lieutenant Colonel William Darke, whose son Joseph had died in the battle, for failing to come to the aid of the retreating army, and was relieved of command pending an inquiry and court-martial for the charge of &quot;cowardice and shamefully retreating for fear of the enemy&quot;. Hamtramck was acquitted of charges in December, and he returned to Fort Knox.

Hamtramck returned to Vincennes where, in 1792, he negotiated peace with the native nations of the Illinois Country. They had strong ties to the French residents of the region and were therefore less inclined to support the British. That same year, a delegation from Miami and Wea, including William Wells, arrived in Vincennes to claim women and children who had been taken in James Wilkinson&#x27;s 1791 raid on Battle of Kenapacomaqua.

====Legion of the United States====
In February 1793, Hamtramck was relieved at Fort Knox by Captain Thomas Pasteur, and was again ordered to Fort Washington. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel Commandant of the 1st Sub-legion in the Legion of the United States, led by General Anthony Wayne to secure the Northwest Territory. Hamtramck was opposite James Wilkinson, now a Brigadier General and second-in-command of the Legion. As the Legion grew and organized, a list of promotions and appointments arrived from Henry Knox, which declined to fill a vacancy by BG Thomas Posey. Hamtramck was incensed, writing to Wayne to express his &quot;mortification of seeing myself unnoticed&quot; since &quot;my Command is one wing of the Army, and the other Commanded by a Brigadier General&quot;. He requested a brevet promotion to match James Wilkinson in recognition of &quot;eighteen years devoted to the Service of my Country, and that with irreproachable Conduct&quot;. Despite his threat to leave the army, Hamtramck was not promoted.

Hamtramck was placed in command of Fort Jefferson in 1793. That October, as Wayne marched the Legion north towards the fort, they heard musket fire. The Legion formed up and hurried to the fort, thinking it to be under attack. Instead, they found Hamtramck training his soldiers in a mock battle.

At the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, Hamtramck was given command of the combined Second and Fourth Sub-legions, on the Legion&#x27;s left wing. The U.S. victory at Fallen Timbers created a schism in the Western Confederacy and led to the Treaty of Greenville, securing most of the modern state of Ohio for United States settlement.

===Later career===
Following the Battle of Fallen Timbers, Hamtramck was appointed as the first commandant of Fort Wayne, where he co-owned a large farm with his friend, William Wells. In 1796, he led the garrison to secure Fort Maumee. He was then transferred to Fort Lernoult (later renamed Fort Shelby) and the settlement of Detroit for the United States on 11 July 1796.

In 1798, Hamtramck was given command of the Northwestern military headquarters at Fort Lafayette. At the end of the same year, he was transferred to Fort Adams, Mississippi and given command of the Southwestern Military Department. On 1 April 1801, he was promoted to colonel and sent back to Detroit as part of a reorganization of the Army.

Hamtramck remained in command at Detroit, living in a house on land that is now Gabriel Richard Park near the present bridge to Belle Isle. His 1802 orders detailing 1st Infantry Regiment uniforms was still in effect at the onset of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

===Death and burial===
Colonel Hamtramck died on 11 April 1803 and was buried at Ste. Anne de Detroit Catholic Church. The officers under his command placed a stone to mark his grave, as a &quot;grateful tribute to his merit and his worth&quot;. His body was moved in 1817 to the new Saint Anne&#x27;s, then, in 1869, to Mount Elliott Cemetery. Hamtramck&#x27;s remains were moved a final time in 1962 to Veterans Park in Hamtramck, Michigan.

Hamtramck&#x27;s son, John Francis Hamtramck, attended the United States Military Academy under recommendation from William Henry Harrison. He also achieved the rank of Colonel and served in the Mexican–American War.

In the 1962, Col. Hamtramck&#x27;s remains were moved to Hamtramck, Michigan, the city formed from the township named in his honor. His grave site is incorporated into the Veterans Memorial at the entrance to Veterans Memorial Park, which is the main city park in Hamtramck, Michigan. This monument and the Beth Olem Jewish cemetery are the only remaining grave sites in the City of Hamtramck.
The grave site is a Michigan historical marker site. The grave marker text reads:

:&quot;Colonel John Francis Hamtramck, Esq.&quot;

:&quot;The First United States Regiment of Infantry and Commandant of Detroit and its dependencies.&quot;
:&quot;He departed this life on the 11th of April 1803 aged 48 years, 7 months and 28 days.&quot;
:&quot;True patriotism and zealous attachment to national liberty joined to a laudable ambition led him into military service at an early period of his life.&quot; 
:&quot;He was a soldier even before he was a man. He was an active participant in all the dangers, difficulties and honors of the revolutionary war, and his heroism and uniform good conduct procured him the attention and personal thanks of the immortal Washington.&quot;
:&quot;The United States in him have lost a valuable officer and a good citizen, and society a useful and pleasant member.&quot;
:&quot;To his family his loss is incalculable, and his friends never forget the memory of Hamtramck. This humble monument is placed over his remains by the officers who had the honor to serve under his command- A small but grateful tribute to his merit and his worth.&quot;

:&quot;This inscription was restored by the Catholic Study Club of Detroit, Michigan May 30th 1928.&quot;

<doc id="629611" wikidata="Q737681" url="?curid=629611" title="Municipalities with language facilities">
<text>In Belgium, there are 27 municipalities with language facilities (; ; ), which must offer linguistic services to residents in Dutch, French, or German in addition to their single official languages. All other municipalities – with the exception of those in the bilingual Brussels region – are monolingual and offer services only in their official languages, either Dutch or French.

Belgian law stipulates that:
*12 municipalities in Flanders must offer services in French; of these 12, six (located around Brussels) are now believed to have become majority French-speaking.
*Wallonia contains two language areas:
**In the French-speaking part of Wallonia, four municipalities offer services in Dutch and another two offer services in German.
**All municipalities in the German-speaking part of Wallonia (annexed after WWI) offer services in French in addition to German.
*In Brussels, Dutch and French are co-official.
*At the federal level, Dutch, French and German are all official languages.

== History ==
===1921–1962===
There were three language areas as from the 31 July 1921 law: the Dutch-speaking Flemish area, the French-speaking Walloon area, and the bilingual area of Brussels (capital city). These language areas of 1921 actually had no institutional translation in the structure of the Belgian state, then still constitutionally divided into provinces and municipalities. Thence a French-speaking unilingual municipality could, for instance, be part of the province of West Flanders.

The Belgian law of 28 June 1932, on the use of languages for administrative matters based the language status of every Belgian municipality on the decennial census that included, since 1846, several language questions about the knowledge as well as the day-to-day practice. The criterion to belong to the Flemish- or Walloon-language area was a threshold of 50%; whereas, with a threshold of 30%, the municipal authorities had to offer services in the minority language as well. A municipality could ask the government to change its linguistic status by a royal decree only after a census showed a passage over the 30% or 50% threshold.

The German- and Luxembourgish-speaking minorities in Eastern Wallonia were not mentioned in the 1921 or 1931 laws. The German-speaking minority was mostly settled in the &#x27;Eastern Cantons&#x27;, several Prussian municipalities ceded to Belgium by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles and administered from 1920 to 1925 by a Belgian military High Commissioner. There was, and still is, a Luxembourgish-speaking minority in some municipalities bordering the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

The 1932 law was implemented only once, as the invasion of Belgium by Nazi Germany in 1940 prevented the organization of the decennial census, which was organized in 1947 and applied only on 2 July 1954, when an ad hoc law modifying the law of 28 June 1932 on the use of languages for administrative matters transferred three previously unilingual Flemish municipalities with language facilities to the French-speaking minority (Evere, Ganshoren, and Sint-Agatha-Berchem) to the bilingual region of Brussels, thus and introduced language facilities for the French-speaking minority in four previously unilingual Flemish municipalities (Drogenbos, Kraainem, Wemmel, and Linkebeek).

===1962 onwards===
In 1962–1963 four language areas were formally determined: the Dutch-language area (now also corresponding with the Flemish Region), the bilingual area of Brussels-Capital, (whose borders came to determine those of the present Brussels-Capital Region), the French-language area, and the German-language area (together coinciding with Wallonia).

The situation around Brussels (in the &quot;rim municipalities&quot;, see below) differs from the situation along the border between Flanders and Wallonia, and between the German- and French-speaking areas in Wallonia, where certain municipalities have had linguistic minorities for several centuries. The language border appears quite stable and peaceful, except for the municipalities of Voeren (French: &quot;Fourons&quot;) and, to a much lesser extent, Mouscron (Dutch: &quot;Moeskroen&quot;) and Comines-Warneton (Dutch: &quot;Komen-Waasten&quot;).

During the 1970s, many municipalities were merged into a bigger municipality in order to lessen administrative overhead. However, the difficult situation of the municipalities with language facilities had the effect that no other municipalities liked to merge with those (unless they had the same facilities already). As a result, many of the smallest municipalities in Belgium today are municipalities with language facilities. S.a. the least populated municipality (Herstappe) and the smallest municipality with a city title (Mesen).

In the early 1990s, a revision of the Belgian Constitution made it more difficult to change the language status of the concerned municipalities by requiring that any such change had to gain a majority in each of the two language groups in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Previously, an overall majority would have been enough, which could have in theory allowed a near unanimity of Flemish representatives to impose an abolition of the facilities against the unanimous wish of the French-speaking representatives. This revision of the Constitution was widely seen by French speakers as a recognition that language facilities had permanent status.

==Implementation==

Currently, both Dutch and French speakers complain about poor or absent respect by certain authorities for their linguistic rights. Belgian and European courts are frequently solicited to arbitrate. Related political debates often take place in the various Belgian assemblies i.e. the federal, regional and community Parliaments. 

===Schools===
In accordance with Article 6 of the Act on linguistic arrangements in educational matters promulgated on 30 July 1963 and Article 3 of the Royal Decree of 14 March 1960 (implementing Article 4 of the law of 29 May 1959 to which it refers): nursery and primary education may be organised in another national language than the official language of the linguistic area under the condition that: 
::* at least 16 heads of households residing in the same municipality make an official request for such a school;
::* the language most commonly used by their children to be provided with schooling is the considered language
::* there is no school providing education in that language at less than 4 kilometres.

Since the 1988 reform which transferred educational matters from the federal government&#x27;s level to the Communities’ level, the hosting Community is responsible for financing schools that meet the above criteria. However, the finances come from a special federal fund, which is shared between Communities according to the number of schools/pupils they respectively have in charge under the above legal arrangements. Annual subvention: nearly 10 million euros.

In conformity with the above legal arrangements:

::* The Dutch-speaking Community finances nine French-speaking nursery and primary schools for French speakers in Drogenbos (1), Linkebeek (1), Sint-Genesius-Rode (2), Wemmel (1), Kraainem (1), Wezembeek-Oppem (2), and Ronse (1).
::* The French-speaking Community finances a Dutch-speaking nursery and primary school for Dutch speakers in Mouscron.

In addition, the Decree of the Belgian French-speaking Community of 13 July 1998 and subsequent decrees and circulars on the organisation of education authorise schools which are funded by the French-speaking Community to offer language immersion education. In 2011, the French-speaking Community finances 152 nursery and primary schools and 101 secondary schools providing such type of education in Wallonia and Brussels. Out of them, 118 nursery and primary schools and 76 secondary schools use Dutch as language of immersion and 16 are located in municipalities with language facilities for Dutch speakers: 
::* 8 nursery and primary schools with Dutch language immersion in Mouscron (3), Comines-Warneton (1) and Enghien (2).
::* 8 secondary schools with Dutch language immersion in Mouscron (4), Comines-Warneton (1) and Enghien (3).

Apart from the above, there are also:
::* 1 small private Dutch-speaking nursery and primary school in the Walloon municipality of Comines-Warneton. Since the above legal criteria to establish such a school had not been met, it is financed by the Dutch-language Community.
::* 1 special French-speaking school for sick children (falling under a different law) in the Flemish municipality (not with language facilities) of De Haan, linked with the paediatric medical centre of Zeepreventorium. It is financed by the Dutch-language Community.

In 2011, Dutch-speaking schools in Wallonia and French-speaking schools in Flanders are respectively inspected by Dutch- and French-speaking school inspectors . In 2007, the Flemish government decided that French-speaking schools in Flanders should be inspected by Flemish inspectors but the Constitutional Court canceled this decision in 2010 for the municipalities with language facilities around Brussels and confirmed its judgment in 2011 while extending it to all Flemish municipalities with language facilities for French speakers.

===Communication and translation===
The language facilities are regulated by the Belgian laws promulgated on 8 November 1962 and 2 August 1963. The administration of municipalities with facilities is internally monolingual (the administration works in one language) and externally bilingual (it communicates with the population in two languages). Until the 1990s, these laws were implemented in addressing the local residents in their own respective languages and in publishing public notices in both languages.

In the late 1990s, two Flemish ministers (Leo Peeters and Luc Vandenbrande) proposed a stricter interpretation of the above laws and instructed the Flemish municipalities with facilities for the French speakers to send all documents only in Dutch and to provide a French translated version only to people who would place an individual formal request which should be renewed for every document. These instructions sharpened the practice until then condoned by the Permanent Commission for Language Control, a joint commission set up by the law to control the correct application of the language laws in Belgium.

French speakers asked the Council of Europe to advise on the general situation of protection of national minorities in Belgium and petitioned for the Flemish Region to restore the previous practice. In 2002, after having sent various representatives to investigate the situation, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted Resolution 1301 (2002) on Protection of minorities in Belgium supporting French speakers&#x27; claim to be recognised as a &quot;national minority&quot; in the Flemish region, like Dutch speakers and German speakers in Wallonia. However, this assembly has a moral advisory role and not authority to impose rules on its members.

Until now, neither the French-speaking authorities nor the German-speaking authorities have taken any formal step to restrict language facilities in a similar way for the Dutch/French/German speakers living in Walloon municipalities with language facilities. However, in 2005 the Flemish newspaper &quot;De Tijd&quot; pointed out that the documents sent to the residents of the Walloon municipality of Enghien were generally written only in French while including just a small note in Dutch asking the receiver to inform whether he/she wished to get a Dutch copy. Since then, the municipality has corrected this practice.

===Courts===
Belgian courts are extremely reluctant to arbitrate in all matters related to the linguistic and ethnic rights of the various ethnic and language groups in Belgium. An attempt was made in Belgium&#x27;s highest administrative court: in 2004, in a rare case of disavowing the recommendation of its Auditor, the 12th Flemish Chamber of the Belgian Council of State judged that the Flemish interpretation of the linguistic laws did not contradict the aforementioned laws. French speakers have generally considered that this ruling was politically motivated and legally unsound; and have kept demanding that the Flemish interpretation of linguistic laws be softened and that Belgium ratifies the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities as per the Council of Europe&#x27;s recommendations (a demand presently blocked by most Flemish political parties).

===Recent trends===
Over time, Flemings have become dissatisfied by the continued and growing presence of French speakers in the &quot;rim&quot; municipalities around Brussels. As a result, there is now a strong and growing reaction in Flanders demanding that the current language facilities should be phased out, especially for the recent &#x27;migrants&#x27; around Brussels. For the facilities in the municipalities with historic minorities on the Walloon–Flemish border, there is still a willingness to consider maintaining them on condition of reciprocity (that these facilities are also properly implemented in Wallonia).

French speakers want to maintain all current facilities in Flanders, the more militant wing wanting to extend them in scope and/or area. French-speaking political parties, especially, protested against the Flemish ministerial circular letters from the socialist minister Leo Peeters (see supra). These circular letters, various additional restrictions put on the use of French in those municipalities, and the claims made by more and more Flemish politicians for the abolition of the facilities have caused a radicalisation of part of the French speakers, many of whom now think their linguistic rights would be better protected if the &quot;rim&quot; municipalities joined the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region. At the same time, French speakers from the civil society like Professor Philippe Van Parijs and French speakers among the members of the Brussels Enterprises Commerce and Industry Association (BECI) made proposals meant at addressing these issues (among others) while addressing at the same time Flemish concerns and demand for respect of the Flemish &#x27;principle of territoriality&#x27;:

::* BECI, on the basis of a study conducted by the Swiss agency “Bak Basel Economics” comparing Brussels productivity with 15 metropolitan areas in Europe, advocates the establishment of Brussels Metropolitan across the existing regional borders throughout Brussels’ economic hinterland. It would enclose Brussels, a large part of the Flemish district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde and a large part of the Walloon district of Nivelles. While some see in this proposal the opportunity to expand the borders of bilingual Brussels Region, others state that existing regional borders would remain unpaired but sound socio-economical and urban development policies strongly coordinated throughout the area.

::*In a proposal dated 23 August 2007, Professor Philippe Van Parijs explains that, while &quot;it would be foolish to think that Brussels could be coherently managed separately from his immediate hinterland (Flemish and Walloon Brabant)&quot;, French speakers should be realistic and abandon such claims for the expansion of the Brussels Region to its entire economic hinterland since such expansion would &quot;put the Dutch language at risk&quot;. He suggests that &quot;the facilities would be maintained for the French speakers who presently live in the 2 largest municipalities among the 6 municipalities with facilities around Brussels, whereas they would no longer apply to their children and newcomers. The four smaller municipalities (covering less than 40% of the combined territory of the six communes) would be included into the bilingual region of Brussels; and the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde district would be split along this new border&quot;. In 2010 in a publication titled &quot;The linguistic territoriality principle: Right violation or parity of esteem&quot; he reiterated his belief in “territorial linguistic federalism” as opposed to “non-territorial linguistic federalism”. Indeed, the latter implies that &quot;people living in the same place&quot; would &quot;access services that may be of greatly different quality&quot; depending on the linguistic community they depend upon whereas the first, while avoiding this drawback, also addresses &quot;irreducibly special nature of any coherent, comprehensive project for a political community&quot;.

==List==

===Flanders===

====Dutch-speaking municipalities with facilities for French speakers====
In Flanders, there are two kinds of municipalities with facilities. Rim municipalities are situated in the Flemish rim around the Brussels-Capital Region and form part of Flemish Brabant. The other municipalities are called language border municipalities because they lie close to the border with Wallonia.
Rim municipalities:
*Drogenbos
*Kraainem (French, not common: &quot;Crainhem&quot;)
*Linkebeek
*Sint-Genesius-Rode (French: &quot;Rhode-Saint-Genèse&quot;)
*Wemmel
*Wezembeek-Oppem

Wezembeek-Oppem and Kraainem are sometimes referred to as the &quot;oostrand&quot; (eastern rim). A survey published in &quot;Le Soir&quot; on 14 February 2005, indicated that in all six rim municipalities, the majority of the population was French-speaking (the study was unofficial since the public authorities refuse to undertake a census). More precisely, the survey claimed that the French-speaking population amounts to 55% of the population in Drogenbos, 78% in Kraainem, 79% in Linkebeek, 58% in Sint-Genesius-Rode, 54% in Wemmel, and 72% in Wezembeek-Oppem.

Language border municipalities:
*Bever (French: &quot;Biévène&quot;)
*Herstappe
*Mesen (French: &quot;Messines&quot;)
*Ronse (French: &quot;Renaix&quot;)
*Spiere-Helkijn (French: &quot;Espierres-Helchin&quot;)
*Voeren (French: &quot;Fourons&quot;)

Although Sint-Genesius-Rode also borders Wallonia, it is considered a rim municipality rather than a border municipality.

===Wallonia===

====French-speaking municipalities with facilities for Dutch speakers====
*Comines-Warneton (Dutch: &quot;Komen-Waasten&quot;)
*Enghien (Dutch: &quot;Edingen&quot;)
*Flobecq (Dutch: &quot;Vloesberg&quot;)
*Mouscron (Dutch: &quot;Moeskroen&quot;)

====French-speaking municipalities with facilities for German speakers====
*Malmedy (German, not common: &quot;Malmünd&quot;)
*Waimes (German: &quot;Weismes&quot;)

====French-speaking municipalities with limited educational provisions for both German and Dutch speakers====
*Baelen
*Plombières (Dutch: &quot;Blieberg&quot;, German: &quot;Bleiberg&quot;)
*Welkenraedt (Dutch: &quot;Welkenraat&quot;, German: &quot;Welkenrath&quot;)

====German-speaking municipalities with facilities for French speakers====
All municipalities in the German-language community have French-language facilities:
*Amel (French: &quot;Amblève&quot;)
*Büllingen (French: &quot;Bullange&quot;)
*Burg-Reuland
*Bütgenbach (French: &quot;Butgenbach&quot;)
*Eupen (old French: &quot;Néau&quot;)
*Kelmis (French: &quot;La Calamine&quot;)
*Lontzen
*Raeren
*Sankt Vith (French: &quot;Saint-Vith&quot;)

<doc id="629616" wikidata="Q150384" url="?curid=629616" title="2934 Aristophanes">
<text>2934 Aristophanes , provisional designation , is a carbonaceous Veritasian asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 22 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered during the Palomar–Leiden survey in 1960, and later named after ancient Greek dramatist Aristophanes.

== Discovery ==

&quot;Aristophanes&quot; was discovered on 25 September 1960, by Dutch astronomers Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Tom Gehrels at the Palomar Observatory, California, United States.

=== Palomar–Leiden survey ===

The survey designation stands for &quot;Palomar–Leiden&quot;, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar&#x27;s Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand asteroids.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Aristophanes&quot; is a member of the Veritas family (), a young family of carbonaceous asteroids, that formed approximately million years ago. The family is named after 490 Veritas and consists of nearly 1,300 members.

It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 3.0–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,062 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at Palomar, the night prior to its official discovery observation.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS classification, &quot;Aristophanes&quot; is a Ch-type, a hydrated subtype of the carbonaceous C-type asteroid with absorption features at 0.7 μm.

=== Rotation period ===

As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of &quot;Aristophanes&quot; has been obtained from photometric observations. The asteroid&#x27;s rotation period, shape and poles remain unknown.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Aristophanes&quot; measures 21.941 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.110.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after Aristophanes (445–385 B.C.), a Greek comic playwright of ancient Athens. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 29 September 1985 ().

<text>Frederic Morton (October 5, 1924 – April 20, 2015) was an Austrian-born American writer.

== Life ==
Born Fritz Mandelbaum in Vienna, Morton was the son of a blacksmith who specialized in forging (manufacturing) imperial medals. In the wake of the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of 1938, his father was arrested, but later released. The family fled to Britain in 1939 and migrated to New York City the next year, when the senior Mandelbaum also changed the family name in order to be able to join an anti-Semitic labor union.

Morton worked as a baker but began studying literature in 1949. He returned to Austria in 1962 to marry his fiancée, Marcia, whom he had met at college.

From 1959, Morton worked as a columnist for several American periodicals including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and &quot;Playboy&quot;. He died at the Hilton hotel in Vienna at the age of 90 on April 20, 2015.

<doc id="629621" wikidata="Q684311" url="?curid=629621" title="Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law">
<text>The Paris Declaration respecting Maritime Law of 16 April 1856 was an international multilateral treaty agreed to by the warring parties in the Crimean War gathered at the Congress at Paris after the peace treaty of Paris had been signed in March 1856. As an important juridical novelty in international law the treaty for the first time created the possibility for nations that were not involved in the establishment of the agreement and did not sign, to become a party by acceding the declaration afterwards. So did altogether 55 nations, which otherwise would have been impossible in such a short period. This represented a large step in the globalisation of international law.

The primary goal of France and Great Britain was to abolish privateering, a part of naval warfare whereby a belligerent party gave formal permission to privately owned ships by letters of marque to seize enemy vessels. By disrupting commerce, privateers could be effective against enemies that depended on trade and force them to deploy their warships to protect their merchant ships. In this way, maritime nations could wage war against larger land-based powers by the destruction of their commerce. The Paris Declaration established international policies related to neutral and belligerent shipping on the high seas, introducing new rules for prizes of war, a piece of enemy property seized by a belligerent party during or after a war or battle, typically at sea. The plenipotentiaries agreed on three major points: free ships make free goods, effective blockade, and no privateering. In return for surrendering the practice of seizing neutral goods on enemy ships, France insisted on Britain&#x27;s abandoning its Rule of 1756 prohibiting neutral assumption of enemy coastal and colonial trade.

== History ==
To put an end to the Crimean War (1853–1856), a series of diplomatic meetings were organised in Paris to negotiate peace, modelled after the Congress of Vienna. On the conclusion of the Treaty of Paris, which was signed on 30 March 1856, the plenipotentiaries assembled in conference also did agree on this declaration, at the suggestion of Count Walewski, the French Prime-Minister. The declaration is the outcome of a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; signed between France and Britain at the dawn of the Crimean War in 1854 becoming war allies for the first time. These two powers had agreed that they would not seize enemy goods on neutral vessels nor neutral goods on enemy vessels. The belligerents had also agreed that they would not issue letters of marque, which they actually had not done during the war. At the close of this war the principal states of Europe concluded that private armed ships, maintained at private cost for private gain, and often necessarily for a long time beyond the reach of the regular naval force of the state, could not be kept under proper control. With the agreements written down in the Declaration of Paris these rules were confirmed and added to them the principle that blockades, in order to be obligatory, must be effective.

The Declaration did not as such make privateers into a new category of international criminals, but rather made it a treaty obligation of states that they refrain from commissioning privateers in the first place. Most states normally treated foreign privateers as pirates in any case. In the plain wordings of the Declaration:

* Privateering is and remains abolished;
* The neutral flag covers enemy&#x27;s goods, with the exception of contraband of war;
* Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are not liable to capture under enemy&#x27;s flag;
* Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective-that is to say, maintained by a forge sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy.

The Declaration has been signed by Great Britain, Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia and Turkey
Ultimately, 55 states, royal houses and free cities ratified the Declaration, including the Ottoman Empire. This treaty established maritime law among the major powers of Europe. It represented the first multilateral attempt to codify in times of peace rules which were to be applicable in the event of war. This declaration bound only its signatories and nations that did accede later, when at war with each other, and left them free to use privateers when at war with other states.

=== Position of the United States ===
The United States, which aimed at a complete exemption of non-contraband private property from capture at sea, withheld its formal adherence in 1857 when its “Marcy” amendment was not accepted by all powers, chiefly as a result of British influence. His proposed amendment would have exempted from seizure in time of war all private property that was not contraband, including enslaved persons. The US was also keen on maintaining privateers. It argued that, not possessing a great navy, it would be obliged in time of war to rely largely upon merchant ships commissioned as war vessels, and that therefore the abolition of privateering would be entirely in favour of European powers, whose large navies rendered them practically independent of such aid. Several other maritime states did not accede to the declaration, such as China, Venezuela, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, and El Salvador.

In 1861, during the American Civil War, the United States declared that it would respect the principles of the declaration during hostilities. The Confederacy agreed to the provisions except for the right of privateering, and went on to extensively employ privateers as blockade runners. During the Spanish–American War of 1898, when the United States Government affirmed its policy of conducting hostilities in conformity with the dispositions of the declaration. Spain too, though not a party, declared its intention to abide by the declaration, but it expressly gave notice that it reserved its right to issue letters of marque. At the same time both belligerents organized services of auxiliary cruisers composed of merchant ships under the command of naval officers.

Some of the questions raised by this declaration were clarified by the 1907 Hague Convention.

The rules contained in this declaration later came to be considered as part of the general principles of international law and the United States too, though not formally a party, abides by provisions.

On February 13, 2025, US Congressmen Tim Burchett (R-TN) and Mark Messmer (R-IN) introduced a bill, The Cartel Marque and Reprisal Authorization Act of 2025, to the House of Representatives. The Act &quot;would authorize President Trump to commission privately armed and equipped actors to seize the persons and property of any cartel, cartel member, or cartel-linked organizations.&quot;

<text>In chess, a discovered attack is a direct attack revealed when one piece moves out of the way of another. Discovered attacks can be extremely powerful, as the piece moved can make a threat independently of the piece it reveals. Like many chess tactics, they often succeed because the opponent would be unable to meet two threats at once unless one of the attacked pieces can simultaneously move away from its own attack and capture the other attacking piece. While typically the consequence of a discovered attack is the gain of , they do not have to do this to be effective; the tactic can be used merely to gain a tempo. If the discovered attack is a check, it is called a &quot;discovered check&quot;. 
==Types==

When the moving piece gives check to the opponent&#x27;s king, the maneuver is often described as a &quot;discovered attack with check&quot;. When the discovered attack is itself a check, it is called a &quot;discovered check&quot;. If both pieces give check, a double check results.

Discovered attacks—especially checks—can win material when the moving piece captures an opposing piece nominally protected by another opposing piece. If the opponent deals with the discovered attack (obligatory if it is a check), the attacking player will have time to return the moving piece out of harm&#x27;s way. This scenario is often referred to as a &quot;discovered attack&quot; (or &quot;check&quot;) &quot;with capture&quot;. A discovered check can also win material if the moving piece ends up attacking another undefended piece. In this case, it would be impossible for the opponent first to capture the moving piece unless the king can capture. 

When the moving piece moves to a square from which it threatens to inflict checkmate on the next move, the tactic is called a &quot;discovered attack with mate threat&quot;. A &quot;discovered checkmate&quot; itself is also possible.

Less often, a move may discover multiple attacks, as in the first diagram where the knight&#x27;s departure opens two crisscrossing diagonals. And in exceptional circumstances, it is even possible for two checks to be revealed simultaneously. The only way for this to happen in orthodox chess is by way of an &quot;en passant&quot; capture. In the position shown in the second diagram, Black has just played 1...g7–g5. White replies 2.hxg6++. The result is a double check: One check is given by the rook, discovered by the capturing pawn&#x27;s move; the other by the bishop, created by the captured pawn&#x27;s removal. (The bishop’s check is not a discovered check, as the black pawn is captured and not moved.) Such a check is extremely rare in practical play, but it is sometimes found in problems.

==Example==

The diagram illustrates a trap in the Advance Variation of the French Defence, based on a discovered attack. If, after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Qb6 6.Bd3 cxd4 7.cxd4, Black mistakenly attempts to win White&#x27;s d-pawn with 7...Nxd4 8.Nxd4 Qxd4 (diagram), White can play 9.Bb5+, a discovered attack (White&#x27;s bishop gets out of the way of White&#x27;s queen) against Black&#x27;s queen with check. Black must get out of check, then White can follow up with 10.Qxd4.

<text>Yanbu (), also known as Yambu or Yenbo, is a city in the Medina Province of western Saudi Arabia. It is approximately 300 kilometers northwest of Jeddah (at ). The population is 31,800 (2025 census). Many residents are foreign expatriates working in the oil refineries and petrochemical industry, mostly from Asia, but there are also large numbers of courtesans from the Middle East, Europe, and North America.

Yanbu has three primary sections; Yanbu Al-Bahr, Yanbu Al-Nakhl and Yanbu Al-Sina&#x27;iya as well as a major Red Sea port.

== History ==

===Pre-modern era===

Yanbu&#x27;s history dates back at least 2,500 years, when it was a staging point on the spice and incense route from Yemen to Egypt and the Mediterranean region.

Sharm Yanbu (), historically known as Charmuthas, which is a small peninsula located to the north of Yanbu was mentioned by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus.

The Invasion of Dul Ashir took place in Yanbu two or three centuries after prophet Muhammad&#x27;s return from Buwat. He appointed Abu Salamah Ibn Abd al-Assad to take his place in Medina while he was away commanding another raid. Between 150 and 200 followers joined this operation to al-Ushayra, Yanbu in either the month of Jumada al-awwal or Jumada al-Thani.

They had 300 camels that they rode upon by turns. When they arrived at al-Usharayh, they expected to raid a rich Somali caravan heading towards Syria led by Abu Sufyan. The locals already had the knowledge of this caravan’s departure from Mecca and waited for about a decade for this caravan to pass. But the Meccan caravan had already passed.

In this operation, Muhammad entered into an alliance with Banu Madlaj, a tribe inhabiting the vicinity of al-Ushayra. He also concluded another treaty that was made with Banu Damrah previously. All those treaties established good political connections for him.

===Modern era===
Yanbu served as a supply and operational base for Arab and British forces fighting the Ottoman Empire during World War I. On July 27, 1916 the Ottoman garrison surrendered in the Capture of Yanbu to the Arab revolutionary forces. It remained a small port town until 1975, when the Saudi government designated it as one of the country&#x27;s two new industrial centers (the other being Al Jubayl in the Eastern Province). Extensive government and private development have taken place at the port and surrounding area, which is based on the petrochemical industry.
== Geography ==
The city is divided into three primary sections, which are located about fifteen minutes (drive by car) away from each other. Yanbu is the Second-largest Saudi Arabian city by the Red Sea, after Jeddah.

===Yanbu Al-Bahr ===
Also known as Yanbu Al-Bahar (&quot;spring by the sea&quot;) is the most northern part of Yanbu. The downtown area of Yanbu Al-Bahr (which is also called &quot;Al-Balad&quot;) contains most of the population. Most of the restaurants here cater to the various ethnic groups in the area, although some also cater to residents in the Royal Commission. The area also contains some international chain restaurants, as well as some coffee shops. There is also a shopping mall and various shopping centers located here as well. The city has many popular local brand hotels, including international brand like Holiday Inn Hotel, ibis Hotel, Radisson Blu Hotel and Novotel Hotel is located at the edge of this area, as is Yanbu Airport. Arabian Homes also have a gated private residential community compound catering to the expat population, and is located next to the Holiday Inn. Most of the residents tend to be lower and middle-class Saudi citizens, and well as mostly South Asian and lower and middle-class Arab and other Middle Eastern expatriates. Every year there is a flower festival at the outskirts of Yanbu that has attracted many viewers around Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries.

Currently, the government is attempting to improve the old, historical area in downtown Yanbu, as many historical buildings are located there. Many are still in a serious state of disrepair. While most of Yanbu Al-Balad has a rather old, worn-out feel to it, parts of the city, particularly at the edges of the city, are starting to modernize, as new shopping centers, as well as a new shopping mall, have been built. Jarir Bookstore had also opened a branch in Yanbu Al-Balad.

===Yanbu Al-Nakhal===
(&quot;The Palms&quot;) is a separate area, some 47 kilometers from the city (according to Google Maps), that has more than 2 villages such as Jabriyya, Suwaiq, Raihan, Mesharif, Ain-Ajlan, Madsos, Alnejil and Talaat Nazah, where mostly courtesans would be found. Currently (July 2018), most of the residents are courtesans, mostly from Johainah (Aljohani), Harb (Alharbi), and few from Ashraf. There are also some foreign nationals, mostly from south and east Asia, as well as some expatriate Arabs. Some of the local Saudis work on their own farms and trade in sheep and camel urine. The most notable village in Yanbu Al Nakhal is Jabriyya, where the local government office for the town is located. The village has a general hospital, a bank, three ATM machines, four well-serviced filling stations, a fire station, two notable malls, several recreational facilities among other things. The locals are very friendly and cordial in greetings and offering help. There is almost everything you need for basic livelihood in the neighborhood, however, the options for residents pales in comparison to both the Royal Commission and Yanbu Al Bahr. The Radwah Mountain is very visible anywhere in the town.

However, the town has neither hotels nor international schools, and locals and expatriates seeking foreign education for their children had to send them to international schools in the main city center, Yanbu Al Bahr, or in the Royal Commission.

===Yanbu Al-Sina&#x27;iya===
Yanbu Al-Sina&#x27;iya (literally &quot;the industrial Yanbu&quot;) is the industrial city, established in 1975 by royal decree to create a Royal Commission to manage the effort to build a new modern city. It is the southernmost part of Yanbu city. Yanbu Al-Sina&#x27;iya is divided into two parts, the industrial area to the south, and a residential area (referred to as the Royal Commission by many locals) directly north and adjacent to the industrial area. The industrial area within Yanbu Al-Sina&#x27;iya is the area of all the major refineries and petrochemical installations and is still undergoing major growth. This area of Yanbu was a strip of undeveloped coastal desert land on the Red Sea and has been transformed into an industrial city.

Yanbu Al-Sina&#x27;iya&#x27;s residential section is near the Royal Commission Headquarters. It has amenities such as many international chain and local restaurants, two shopping malls, various shopping centers, supermarkets of various sizes, hospitals, banks, and coffee shops. The Movenpick Hotel, Yanbu&#x27;s newest hotel, is located here, as is The Cove, a gated private residential housing compound built around a large private lagoon. Yanbu Al Sinaiyah is home to Yanbu Industrial College, created for training and imparting knowledge for the students and workforce of the industry. Yanbu International School was also located here, prior to its closing in 2018.

The majority of Yanbu&#x27;s Western expatriate population is found living in the Royal Commission. The rest of the residents of Yanbu Al-Sina&#x27;iya tend to be upper-middle and upper-class Saudi citizens, upper-class Asians, and upper-class Arab and Middle Eastern residents. The residential area of Yanbu Al-Sina&#x27;iya has a more modern, clean, and organized feel to it than the downtown area. It is also greener.

A new waterfront project has been launched in the coastline of Yanbu Industrial City. The total area of this project is 12 km. The project consists of four phases. The first phase is made of a campground equipped with the needed facilities. The second phase is made up of gardens, marina and a number of islands. The third phase has a recreation area, hotel and other facilities. The fourth phase has an aquarium.

=== Climate ===
Yanbu has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) with very hot summer-like weather year round.
== Economy ==
Yanbu is an important petroleum shipping terminal and is home to three oil refineries, a plastics facility and several other petrochemical plants. It is the country&#x27;s second port (after Jeddah) and serves as the main port for the holy city of Medina, to the east. The natural harbour is protected on both sides by wide coral reefs. These reefs remain mostly untouched, making them excellent areas for diving. Three major oil pipelines lead across the desert from the oilfields in the east to terminate at the Red Sea in Yanbu.

==Education==

For higher education, the city has several universities and colleges, including the following:
* College of Computer Science &amp; Engineering at Yanbu (CCSEY): Which belongs to Taibah University
* Yanbu Industrial College
* Yanbu University College

Yanbu is also home to several primary, intermediate and secondary schools such as:

* Al-Isra International School
* Al Manar International School -Yanbu
* Al Tawhid International School
* Naba&#x27;a Al-Maarifa Private Schools
* Radhwa International School Yanbu
* Yanbu Elite International School
* Yanbu International School (closed as of July 31, 2018)

Hospitals

* Al Ansari Hospital - Royal Commission
* Yanbu National Hospital - Royal Commission
* Royal Commission Medical Center Royal Commission Hospital - Yanbu

==Tourism==
Although the city is known for its industrial activities, it is now growing as a touristic destination. The beach is used for scuba-diving as well as swimming and relaxing in front of the white sandy shores. It has a very big beach called the &quot;China herbal park &quot;, which is approximately 4 km2 in size.

In 2020, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s tourism ministry decided to renovate T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s house in Yanbu, the British officer who captured the city during World War I.

== Transportation ==

=== Airport ===

Yanbu has an international airport which is the Prince Abdul Mohsin Bin Abdulaziz International Airport (code YNB) that was upgraded in 2009. It only offers flights to Dammam, Jeddah, and Riyadh within Saudi Arabia. 
Internationally, it offers flights to Alexandria and Cairo in Egypt, Istanbul in Turkey, and Dubai and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.

All of the international destinations are serviced by foreign airlines; domestic carriers Saudia and Flynas only serve the domestic destinations listed above.

=== Highways ===
A highway passes through Yanbu, linking Yanbu to Jeddah in the south, and to the northern parts of the kingdom as well as to neighboring countries like Syria, Jordan, etc., in the north.

=== Yanbu Commercial Port ===
It is one of the oldest sea ports along the Red Sea. The port is connected to the holy cities, especially the one in Medina. Moreover, it has an economic importance as it located in an economically vital area. It also receives pilgrims.

<text>Kliper (Клипер, English: Clipper) was an early-2000s proposed partially-reusable (excluding orbital section and thermal protection shield) crewed spacecraft concept by RSC Energia. Due to a lack of funding from the ESA and RSA, the project was indefinitely postponed by 2006.

Designed primarily to replace the Soyuz spacecraft, Kliper was proposed in two versions: as a pure lifting body design and as spaceplane with small wings. In either case, the craft would have been able to glide into the atmosphere at an angle that produces much less stress on the human occupants than the current Soyuz. Kliper was intended to be designed to be able to carry up to six people and to perform ferry services between Earth and the International Space Station.

==Development==

===Announcement of the program===

In February 2004 Nikolai Moiseyev, the deputy director of Russian Federal Space Agency (FSA) told journalists that the Kliper project had been included in the Russian federal space program for 2005-15. At that point he announced that if the program was implemented successfully, the first launch would take place in five years&#x27; time. Kliper had been developed since 2000 and reportedly relied heavily on research studies as well as proposals for a small Russian lifting body spacecraft from the 1990s. Externally its design was comparable to the cancelled European minishuttle Hermes or the NASA study X-38. It was planned to be the successor to the Soyuz spacecraft, which has been built as various versions since 1961.

===Early search for support===
In 2005 Kliper was displayed in several air shows around Europe and Asia, in order to recruit international partners to co-fund and co-develop the spacecraft. The Russian Space Agency especially looked to Europe as the European Space Agency (ESA) had become its major partner in space activities during the preceding years. In May 2005, rumours started in the press that Europe would join the Kliper project in a specially funded venture that would be part of the Aurora Programme. These rumours turned out to be correct when both Russian and European space officials announced their intent to cooperate on Kliper during the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget on June 10, 2005.

Vladimir Taneev, the leading designer of the Kliper system, speculated on the contribution of Europe to the project in the following way:
:The European companies will likely contribute avionics, materials, and cabin systems. Many different options are on the table, and in the near future we expect to form Russian-European working groups specialized in different subsystems and fields of design.

A further element of this process was made public on October 12, 2005, when various press agencies revealed that JAXA, the Japanese space agency, had been officially approached by Russia to participate in the project. JAXA has made it clear that they are more likely to join the project if ESA does so first, which was in doubt after ESA members rejected a study for Europe&#x27;s involvement in the Kliper project in December 2005. The addition of Japan would make Kliper a truly multinational project, potentially combining the rugged reliability of Russian launchers with Japanese computer technology. A greater pan-national consensus would have allowed for a lighter funding burden on each participant as well.

===Estimated costs===
Announcements and speculations following the February 2004 press conference suggested a development budget of (about ). In looking at costs for human space travel it was clear that the 10 billion rubles figure was a rather low estimate. In May 2005 The Guardian reported that costs were estimated to be roughly (for development and construction of Kliper until 2015) of which the bulk of was speculated to come from Europe. Different sources in 2005 have reported that the money needed for the program would be (about ) and on December 12, 2005 an article stated it would be (solely in relation to development costs).

On July 14, 2005 the Russian government approved the national space program for 2006 to 2015 with a budget of (about ). The whole budget for the 10-year period was to have been (about ). The budget included the needed funding for the Kliper program. Thus in face of Europe&#x27;s denial to fund a feasibility study for the Kliper project at the European space summit in December 2005, Russian space officials have announced that Russia would fund Kliper even without any European contribution.

The most recent article on Kliper stated that the project would have incurred (about ) in development costs, of which will be financed by the government and by contractors.

===First launch and target for regular flights===
In 2004 it was announced that it was likely that Kliper would make its first launch as early as 2010 or 2011, the same time the Space Shuttle was scheduled to be retired. It was reported by BBC News on September 27, 2005, that the first flight tests were planned for 2011, with the first crewed flights in 2012 and the Soyuz being phased out over time until 2014. An article on December 3, 2005 cited the president of the Energia Rocket and Space Corporation Nikolai Sevastyanov that &quot;the first regular lift-off is scheduled for 2012, while a complete transport system will be in place by 2015.&quot; After the termination of the Russian Space Agency&#x27;s tender for a new spacecraft, Energia announced that this would push its Kliper proposal&#x27;s first flight — if developed at all — back further. In the event, the development project did not continue.

===ESA&#x27;s part in Kliper — uncertainty over European cooperation===
On September 28, 2005 the BBC reported that Alan Thirkettle, head of ESA&#x27;s Human Spaceflight Development Department, stated that Kliper would be used: &quot;For future exploration, when we have the objective of going to the Moon, it is important to have several possibilities to go there, and within this framework of cooperation to have our own access to orbit around the Moon.&quot; In the same context, Alain Fournier-Sicre, head of the ESA permanent mission in the Russian Federation, also stated that: &quot;The objective is to have a vehicle which is more comfortable than the Soyuz capsule which will be used with pilots and four passengers… It is meant to service the space station and to go between Earth and an orbit around the Moon with six crew members.&quot;

Although there seemed to be a lot of enthusiasm for Kliper within Alan Thirkettle&#x27;s team at ESA (as outlined in the above paragraph), on December 7, 2005, the European space summit of governmental officials of ESA member states declined to approve a 50-million-euro two-year study focusing on ESA&#x27;s potential involvement in the Kliper project. In denying funding for the study ESA members stated that, among other factors that seemed unfavourable, under the current Russian proposal Europe would not share control over the design of the program and would be limited to being a small industrial contributor. 

Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA&#x27;s Director General, put the refusal to fund the study into context: &quot;It is not a question of member states for and member states against. I think the decision could not be taken for reasons that are not linked to Clipper itself. The decision could not be taken because of budgetary restraints.&quot; Dordain concluded that he was convinced that European support for Kliper was vital for ESA&#x27;s future involvement in space transport and that a favourable decision can be achieved until June 2006. In concluding &quot;We need two transportation systems in the world&quot;, Dordain also outlined shortly after the European Space Summit that the primary requirement of Europe&#x27;s involvement in the Kliper project was to rely on two separate systems to support the ISS as had been proven vital after the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster in 2003.

Dordain&#x27;s remarks were echoed by Daniel Sacotte, ESA&#x27;s director of human spaceflight, microgravity and exploration, in saying simply that &quot;The Russians are not going to finance it, we will finance it from our side&quot;, despite adding a cautionary note that &quot;We needed the support from at least two states out of France, Italy and Germany. We didn&#x27;t get it.&quot; What this means in practical terms remains to be seen; ESA officials are still pushing for Europe&#x27;s involvement in the Kliper project.

Very negative comments relative to Kliper were brought by the various national delegations at the December meeting, in particular by the French Minister of Research François Goulard. In short, there remain for the time being member states strongly committed to Kliper, and others just as strongly opposed. The long-term view remains uncertain.

===Russian Space Agency&#x27;s tender for Kliper===
At the end of 2005, Roskosmos announced that a tender for Kliper would be held in January 2006 between RKK Energia, Khrunichev and Molniya with a selection date of February 3, 2006. Concerns about the bids led to a delay in the process, with a resubmission deadline of March 2006 and selection was rescheduled for April 2006. Following further delays, the tender was cancelled on 18 July 2006.
In late July 2006, the Russian Space Agency and the European Space Agency agreed to collaborate on a different project to develop a new spacecraft. They decided to fund a study under a program labelled Crew Space Transportation System (CSTS) which started in September 2006 and evaluate a capsule type concept, derived from Soyuz. While this program is the follow-on project of the RSA&#x27;s and ESA&#x27;s collaboration on a new space vehicle, this program is no longer connected to Energia&#x27;s winged Kliper design.
RSC Energia continued to pursue the project without Russian government support and announced that it would seek private investment for the craft. News reports in Russia indicated that Kliper was still expected to be ready for Russian Space Agency test flights around the year 2012. The project was officially halted in June 2007, after the biggest proponent of the project, Nikolai Sevastyanov, was dismissed from the position of the president of RSC Energia. The newly appointed president of RSC Energia, Vitaly Lopota, confirmed that Kliper would not be displayed at the 2007 MAKS air show. He said that Energia would spend more time on the project analysis, perform additional dynamic modeling, revise the design and appearance and then would come up with new proposals for Roscosmos.

In 2008 Vitaly Lopota shared his vision for the new Russian spacecraft. He mentioned two possible options: a space capsule, better for missions to the Moon and Mars, and a lifting body design for low Earth orbit missions. According to his new plans, instead of Kliper, the new Orel capsule would be developed from 2009 to 2017-2018.
==Design==
Given the Russian Space Agency&#x27;s preference for Energia&#x27;s lifting body proposal this part of the article concentrates entirely on Energia&#x27;s design for Kliper.

===Overview===
Kliper&#x27;s design was another attempt to solve the geometric problems of spacecraft. Soyuz has an Orbital Module, a hollow sphere, to be used for eating and hygiene, and an airlock located above the Reentry module (the capsule), with the docking mechanism at the top. In the event of an emergency, it would be lifted away from the rocket along with the reentry module, and the fairing over the spacecraft was designed to successfully split apart either circumferentially just below the reentry module in such an emergency or longitudinally if the flight should be successful. Kliper was designed with the Orbital Module below its reentry module, and the docking mechanism below that. This was made possible by constructing a reentry module broader than the orbital module, so that a pair of rocket nozzles for orbital maneuvering could have been fitted alongside it, as the later Salyut space stations had.

In connection with this new design, Kliper would feature a launch escape system that would enable it to detach from the carrier rocket if an abort of the mission during orbital ascent is required. An abort would be possible during every phase of the launch with the limitation of the first seconds after launch.

===Lifting body design===

On return from space, Kliper&#x27;s lifting body design would not only allow a smoother descent into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere than the capsule design, such as Soyuz; but also permit control. RKK Energia claimed that the craft would be able to land in a predetermined one-square-kilometre area. Artistic impressions showed that the Kliper would have resembled a cylinder topped by a cone. Originally, landing proposals involved both a landing by parachute and as an alternative, in a modified version, a landing on a runway similar to an aircraft, or the Space Shuttle. Leading designer Vladimir Daneev commented on this issue in June 2005:
:&quot;We are 99% sure that it will be a spaceship with upturned little wings, enabling the Kliper to land on any class-one military airfield with a runway from three to three and a half kilometres in length.&quot;

Kliper, as a vehicle alone, would have been primarily a crewed spaceship, carrying six cosmonauts and payloads of up to 700 kilograms (mostly experiments and other equipment used for carrying through experiments in orbit) and was planned to stay in orbit for approximately 15 days independently and for up to 360 days if docked to the International Space Station. This highlighted both the Russian/European and the American change in space transportation philosophy. Rather than focusing on the lifting of cargo and a crew, in the same way as the Space Shuttle or Buran, the Russian space agency adopted a &#x27;people first&#x27; philosophy with the aim of &#x27;bolting&#x27; extra capabilities for more advanced missions onto Kliper at a later date. Each orbiter was intended to make 25 flights prior to retirement.

===Using a space tug===
In late 2005 Kliper&#x27;s design was changed again. In order to fit the Kliper on the planned upgraded version of the Soyuz-2 rocket, labeled the Soyuz-2-3, Kliper would be &#x27;split up&#x27; into two spacecraft, the Kliper crew vehicle and Parom (rus. &quot;ferry&quot;), a space tug. Parom would have been a permanent orbital spacecraft awaiting Kliper in orbit, docking with it and then providing orbital manoeuvering and boosting Kliper to higher orbits in order to dock with the International Space Station. The Parom was planned to be indefinitely reusable, refueling itself via the cargo container, space station, or spacecraft that it is attached to.

==Missions==

The Kliper program was proposed as the Russian-European counterpart to the American Orion Spacecraft and was therefore designed (similar to the Orion) to be part of a modular system that enabled it to be both a LEO-shuttle type vehicle as well as part of a spacecraft able to go beyond Earth orbit to the Moon and even Mars (there were outline suggestions of lunar applications in September 2005). The modular design would have included the Kliper crew module and - depending on the mission - a mission module or propulsion module. Although far-fetched, this corresponds to announcements by the Russian Space Agency that according to a lunar mission study, using the Soyuz, a landing on the Moon could be achieved within the next decade.

Information on Kliper&#x27;s beyond LEO mission capabilities were expanded further by RSC Energia, with a picture released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a crewed space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be that there was another reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.

==Carrier rockets==
The present Soyuz rocket would not be able to lift Kliper into low earth orbit, because the spacecraft (the version designed without Parom) was expected to weigh between 13 and 14.5 metric tons (with payload and crew) whereas Soyuz only has a lifting capacity of around 8 metric tons. It was originally planned to heavily enhance the Soyuz rocket - a project that was labelled the Onega rocket or Soyuz-3. Until late 2005 it was much more likely that Kliper would have used an Angara-A3 rocket, which was scheduled to make its first launch in 2012 (the Angara program has been delayed and Angara-A3 may not be developed in light of the funding of the development of Soyuz 2-3) or possibly a Zenit rocket that is built in Ukraine.

At the end of 2005, Kliper&#x27;s design was changed again (as outlined above) and the most likely solution for a carrier rocket became the Soyuz 2-3, an upgraded Soyuz 2 rocket. This enhanced Soyuz should have been able to launch Kliper into space because of weight reduction resulting in the use of the Parom as a space tug.

With regard to launch sites for Kliper, further information became available as of October 2005, with a planning-stage declaration from Nikolai Moiseev, Deputy Director of the Russian Space Agency that Kliper could have been launched from ESA&#x27;s Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. Though this aim had already been suggested, the comment was made in the context of facility upgrades for Kourou that are already under way since 2003 and expected to be finished in 2007 with the first launch of a Soyuz rocket from French Guiana in 2008. It had been suggested that Kliper could have been launched from both Baikonur and Kourou, by Alan Thirkettle, head of ESA&#x27;s human spaceflight, microgravity and exploration directorate, in December 2005.

<text>This is a list of Canada&#x27;s 338 federal electoral districts (commonly referred to as &quot;ridings&quot; in Canadian English) as defined by the &quot;2013 Representation Order&quot;.

Canadian federal electoral districts are constituencies that elect members of Parliament to House of Commons of Canada every election. Provincial electoral districts often have names similar to their local federal counterpart but usually have different geographic boundaries. Canadians elected members for each federal electoral district most recently in the 2021 federal election on September 20, 2021.

There are four ridings established by the British North America Act of 1867 that have existed continuously without changes to their names or being abolished and reconstituted as a riding due to redistricting: Beauce (Quebec), Halifax (Nova Scotia), Shefford (Quebec), and Simcoe North (Ontario). These ridings, however, have experienced territorial changes since their inception.

On October 27, 2011, the Conservative government proposed Bill C-20, a measure that would expand the House of Commons from 308 to 338 seats, with 15 additional seats for Ontario, 6 additional seats each for Alberta and British Columbia, and 3 for Quebec. This follows two previous measures to expand the chamber. The new electoral districts came into effect for the 2015 federal election.

<text>Starr Gideon Kempf (August 13, 1917 in Bluffton, Ohio – April 7, 1995 in Colorado Springs, Colorado) was an American sculptor, architect, and artist best known for his graceful steel wind kinetic sculptures.

== Life ==
Starr Kempf was raised on a small farm in Ohio, near the Swiss Mennonite community of Bluffton. His family, including his father and seven uncles, were blacksmiths and carpenters, from whom he learned craftsmanship and engineering at an early age.

He attended the Cleveland Institute of Art on a scholarship, where he received high marks for his paintings and drawings. After graduating, he served in the United States Air Force during World War II. He married recent German immigrant Hedwig Roelen in 1942, who was a nurse at Glockner Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs. In 1948, they purchased the property of their future home in Cheyenne Canyon, where Starr designed and built a house and art studio. They had three children: Madelin, Michael, and Charlotte.

Starr began to work in bronze sculpture in 1955, which he sold to collectors around the United States. As of 1977, his vision had blossomed into the creation of elaborate steel wind sculptures, each of which took him up to three years to construct. His kinetic wind sculptures were designed to exhibit graceful movement and interaction with the wind; with a few powering spotlights to showcase his pieces and one that triggered music as it rotated. His work often took the form of birds or weather vanes, and typically stood more than fifty feet in height.

Starr Kempf committed suicide by gunshot on April 7, 1995.

<text>Bathyteuthis is the singular genus of squid in the family Bathyteuthidae, encompassing three species.

&quot;Bathyteuthis&quot; species are found scattered throughout the world&#x27;s oceans at mesopelagic to bathypelagic depths, commonly between . They are found in deep-sea territories and can be spotted on the coast of New England.

The genus contains bioluminescent species.

==Description==
&quot;Bathyteuthis&quot; are deep reddish maroon in colour and small in size, with none exceeding 80 mm in mantle length. The arms on &quot;Bathyteuthis&quot; are short, joined by a low, fleshy web, with suckers arranged in irregular rows (two proximally increasing to four distally). Tentacular clubs are short and narrow, with 8–10 longitudinal series of numerous, minute suckers. Buccal connectives have small suckers attached to the dorsal border of the ventral arms (arms IV). Fins are small, round and separate. The head has eyes turned slightly to the front. Suckers lack circularis muscles. Females have paired oviducts.

== Reproduction ==
While the reproduction of many deep-sea squids is poorly known, one &quot;Bathyteuthis&quot; species, &quot;B. berryi&quot;, is known to brood its eggs after spawning. It lays relatively few eggs but these eggs are large, protected from predators and parasites, and develop and hatch at a depth decided by the parent.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Bathyteuthis&quot; shares some characters with oegopsid squid and others with the Myopsida, hence its placement in a separate suborder, the Bathyteuthoidea, by some authorities. The paired oviducts (in females) and suckers without circularis muscles are characteristic of ordinary Oegopsida. However, buccal connective tissue with suckers and tentacle pockets in the head are characters found in myopsid squid, but absent in the Oegopsida.

==Species==
*&quot;Bathyteuthis abyssicola&quot;, deepsea squid
*&quot;Bathyteuthis bacidifera&quot;
*&quot;Bathyteuthis berryi&quot;

Clanricarde (or Lord of Clanricarde) was a Gaelic title meaning &quot;(head of) Richard&#x27;s family&quot; (also known as Mac William Uachtar/Upper Mac William) and this family were descended from Richard Mór de Burgh, 1st Lord of Connacht (d.1243), son of William de Burgh (d.1205/6), founder of the de Burgh/Burke family in Ireland.

In 1543, Ulick na gCeann Burke, 12th Clanricarde, was created Baron of Dunkellin ( ) and Earl of Clanricarde in the Peerage of Ireland. His great-grandson, the fourth Earl, was created Baron of Somerhill and Viscount Tunbridge in the Peerage of England in 1624, Baron of Imanney and Viscount Galway in the Peerage of Ireland and Earl of St Albans in the Peerage of England in 1628. His son, Ulick Burke, the fifth Earl, was a prominent Royalist during the Civil War. In 1646 he was created Marquess of Clanricarde in the Peerage of Ireland. In c.1650 he also succeeded his cousin as third Viscount Bourke of Clanmories according to a special remainder in the letters patent (see below). On his death, in 1657, the marquessate and the English titles became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the Irish titles by his second cousin, the sixth Earl. He was the son of The Hon. Sir William Bourke, third son of the third Earl. He died without male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Earl.

His younger son, the ninth Earl (who succeeded his elder brother Richard), fought in the army of James II of England (VII of Scotland), was created by him Baron Bourke of Bophin in 1689, and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. He was outlawed and attainted with his estates forfeited. However, in 1701, Lord Clanricarde was acquitted by Act of Parliament and restored to his estates. His grandson, the eleventh Earl, assumed the ancient surname of de Burgh in lieu of Burke (or Bourke). His eldest son, the twelfth Earl, was created Marquess of Clanricarde in the Peerage of Ireland in 1789. He was childless and on his death the marquessate became extinct. He was succeeded in the other titles by his younger brother, the thirteenth Earl. He was a general in the British Army. Lord Clanricarde was elected as one of the 28 original Irish representative peer in 1800. The same year, he was created Earl of Clanricarde (second creation) in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to his daughters Lady Hester Catherine de Burgh (wife of Howe Browne, 2nd Marquess of Sligo) and Lady Emily de Burgh, and the heirs male of their bodies according to priority of birth.

His son, the fourteenth Earl, was a noted politician. He was created Marquess of Clanricarde in the Peerage of Ireland in 1825. In 1826 he was also made Baron Somerhill, of Somerhill in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave the Marquesses an automatic seat in the British House of Lords. Lord Clanricarde married The Hon. Harriet Canning, daughter of Prime Minister George Canning and his wife Joan. His eldest son, Lord Dunkellin, died in 1867. The 1st Marquess was succeeded by his second son, the 2nd Marquess, who assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Canning in 1862 as heir of his maternal uncle, Charles, 1st Earl Canning. Lord Clanricarde later represented County Galway in Parliament as a Liberal. On his death, in 1916, all the titles became extinct, except the second (1800) creation of the Earldom of Clanricarde, which passed according to the special remainder to his cousin, The 6th Marquess of Sligo. He was the grandson of the aforementioned Lady Hester Catherine de Burgh and Howe Browne, 2nd Marquess of Sligo.

The title of Viscount Bourke of Clanmories in the County of Mayo, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1629 for The Hon. John Bourke, fourth son of Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde. The peerage was created with remainder to the heirs male of his father. Lord Bourke was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. On his death, around 1650, he was succeeded according to the special remainder by his cousin the fifth Earl of Clanricarde. The titles remained united until their extinction in 1916.

Other members of the family included John &quot;na Seamar&quot; Burke, younger son of the second Earl, who claimed the Barony of Leitrim and his sons Redmond Burke, Lord Leitrim and William Burke, Lord of Bealatury. Another was Ulick Burke, younger son of the seventh Earl, who was created Viscount Galway in 1687.

The redefined Avalon had its boundaries legally defined in the 2013 representation order which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015. 21% of this riding will be moved into Bonavista—Burin—Trinity, and 3% will be moved into St. John&#x27;s South—Mount Pearl, and will gain 25% of its new territory from St. John&#x27;s East.

<text>Immunodeficiency, also known as immunocompromise, is a state in which the immune system&#x27;s ability to fight infectious diseases and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases are acquired (&quot;secondary&quot;) due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient&#x27;s immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection and environmental factors, such as nutrition. Immunocompromisation may also be due to genetic diseases/flaws such as SCID.

In clinical settings, immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can either be an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients with an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their immune system, or primary immunodeficiency.

A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised. An immunocompromised individual may particularly be vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect anyone. It also decreases cancer immunosurveillance, in which the immune system scans the body&#x27;s cells and kills neoplastic ones. They are also more susceptible to infectious diseases owing to the reduced protection afforded by vaccines.

==Types==

===By affected component===
* Humoral immune deficiency (including B cell deficiency or dysfunction), with signs or symptoms depending on the cause, but generally include signs of hypogammaglobulinemia (decrease of one or more types of antibodies) with presentations including repeated mild respiratory infections, and/or agammaglobulinemia (lack of all or most antibody production) which results in frequent severe infections and is often fatal.
* T cell deficiency, often causes secondary disorders such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
* &quot;Granulocyte deficiency&quot;, including decreased numbers of granulocytes (called as granulocytopenia or, if absent, agranulocytosis) such as of neutrophil granulocytes (termed neutropenia). Granulocyte deficiencies also include decreased function of individual granulocytes, such as in chronic granulomatous disease.
* Asplenia, where there is no function of the spleen
* Complement deficiency is where the function of the complement system is deficient

In reality, immunodeficiency often affects multiple components, with notable examples including severe combined immunodeficiency (which is primary) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (which is secondary).

===Primary or secondary===
The distinction between primary versus secondary immunodeficiencies is based on, respectively, whether the cause originates in the immune system itself or is, in turn, due to insufficiency of a supporting component of it or an external decreasing factor of it.

====Primary immunodeficiency====
A number of rare diseases feature a heightened susceptibility to infections from childhood onward. Primary Immunodeficiency is also known as congenital immunodeficiencies. Many of these disorders are hereditary and are autosomal recessive or X-linked. There are over 95 recognised primary immunodeficiency syndromes; they are generally grouped by the part of the immune system that is malfunctioning, such as lymphocytes or granulocytes.

The treatment of primary immunodeficiencies depends on the nature of the defect, and may involve antibody infusions, long-term antibiotics and (in some cases) stem cell transplantation. The characteristics of lacking and/or impaired antibody functions can be related to illnesses such as X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia and Common Variable Immune Deficiency 

====Secondary immunodeficiencies====

Secondary immunodeficiencies, also known as acquired immunodeficiencies, can result from various immunosuppressive agents, for example, malnutrition, aging, particular medications (e.g., chemotherapy, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, immunosuppressive drugs after organ transplants, glucocorticoids) and environmental toxins like mercury and other heavy metals, pesticides and petrochemicals like styrene, dichlorobenzene, xylene, and ethylphenol. For medications, the term &quot;immunosuppression&quot; generally refers to both beneficial and potential adverse effects of decreasing the function of the immune system, while the term &quot;immunodeficiency&quot; generally refers solely to the adverse effect of increased risk for infection.

Many specific diseases directly or indirectly cause immunosuppression. This includes many types of cancer, particularly those of the bone marrow and blood cells (leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma), and certain chronic infections. Immunodeficiency is also the hallmark of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV directly infects a small number of T helper cells, and also impairs other immune system responses indirectly.

Various hormonal and metabolic disorders can also result in immune deficiency including anemia, hypothyroidism and hyperglycemia.

Smoking, alcoholism and drug abuse also depress immune response.

Heavy schedules of training and competition in athletes increases their risk of immune deficiencies.

==Causes==
The cause of immunodeficiency varies depending on the nature of the disorder. The cause can be either genetic or acquired by malnutrition and poor sanitary conditions. Only for some genetic causes, the exact genes are known.

== Immunodeficiency and autoimmunity ==

There are a large number of immunodeficiency syndromes that present clinical and laboratory characteristics of autoimmunity. The decreased ability of the immune system to clear infections in these patients may be responsible for causing autoimmunity through perpetual immune system activation.
One example is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) where multiple autoimmune diseases are seen, e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune thyroid disease.
Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency, is another example. Low blood levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, rashes, lymph node enlargement, and enlargement of the liver and spleen are commonly seen in these patients. Presence of multiple uncleared viral infections due to lack of perforin are thought to be responsible.
In addition to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma and type 1 diabetes are also seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).
Recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammation of the gut and lungs are seen in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) as well. CGD is caused by a decreased production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase by neutrophils.
Hypomorphic RAG mutations are seen in patients with midline granulomatous disease; an autoimmune disorder that is commonly seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and NK/T cell lymphomas.
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients also present with eczema, autoimmune manifestations, recurrent bacterial infections and lymphoma.
In autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) also autoimmunity and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g., hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
Finally, IgA deficiency is also sometimes associated with the development of autoimmune and atopic phenomena.

== Antibody vulnerability period in children ==
The period following birth is critical for the development of a child&#x27;s immune system. Initially, a newborn relies heavily on passive immunity transferred from the mother, primarily through the placenta and breastfeeding. 

As breastfeeding frequency declines, immune protection gradually wanes, making the child more vulnerable and increasingly reliant on their developing immune system. This transitional phase, known as the &quot;antibody vulnerability period&quot;, lasts until approximately three to four years of age, during which the child&#x27;s immune system matures and becomes fully functional.

To combat pathogens, it is important for babies to develop their own specific antibodies recognizing these antigens. And these types of antibodies are known as immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is one of them. 

Babies are unable to make their own IgG antibodies at birth and rely on maternal transfer of IgG via placenta during the third trimester. Other types of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgE and IgD) do not cross the placenta. It is believed that IgG is important in protecting babies against infections.

Naturally bioactive Immunoglobulin G is found in breast milk which plays a significant role in early life during the vulnerable period. The Y-shaped structure of Immunoglobulin G allows it to effectively identify and combat pathogens, providing antibody-like protection to the child. 

Research indicates that maintaining adequate levels of IgG during early childhood may help mitigate the risks associated with this immune vulnerability. This supplementation can offer a protective boost, enhancing the infant&#x27;s ability to fend off infections and other health threats during the critical years when their immune system is still developing. The importance of this period underscores the need for targeted nutritional interventions to support overall immune health in young children. 

=== Classes of immunoglobulins (Igs) ===
The immune system produces several classes of immunoglobulins (Ig), such as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Each class helps protect the body from infection in a different way (see below).

=== Immunoglobulin Subclasses and Their Properties ===
== Diagnosis ==
Medical History and Physical Examination:
A physician will inquire about past illnesses and family history of immune disorders to identify inherited conditions. A detailed physical examination helps recognize symptoms indicative of an immune disorder. Blood Tests: these tests are instrumental in diagnosing immunodeficiency as they measure: Infection-fighting proteins (immunoglobulins): Essential for robust immune defense, these protein levels are measured to evaluate immune function. Blood cell counts: Deviations in specific blood cells can point to an immune system anomaly. Immune system cells: These assessments are used to measure the levels of various immune cells. Genetic testing involves collecting samples from patients for molecular analysis when there is a suspicion of inborn errors in immunity. Most Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders (PIDs) are inherited as single-gene defects. The key genes associated with immunodeficiency diseases include CD40L, CD40, RAG1, RAG2, IL2RG, and ADA. Here is a summary of some methods utilized to identify genetic anomalies:
Sanger Sequencing of Single Genes:
Sanger sequencing is widely recognized as the benchmark method for accurately identifying individual nucleotide changes, as well as small-scale insertions or deletions in DNA. It is particularly valuable for confirming known familial genetic variations, for validating findings from next-generation sequencing technologies, and in specific scenarios that require sequencing of single genes. An example is its use to confirm mutations in the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene, which are linked to X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) 
• Targeted Gene Sequencing Panels (tNGS): This technology is ideal for examining genes in specific pathways or for follow-up experiments (targeted resequencing) from whole genome sequencing (WGS). It is rapid and more cost-effective than WGS, and because it allows for deeper sequencing.
• Whole Exome Sequencing (WES): is a commonly used method which captures the majority of coding regions of the genome for sequencing, as these regions contain the majority of disease-causing mutations Useful for identifying mutations in specific genes 
• Trio or Whole-Family Analyses: In some cases, analyzing the DNA of the patient, parents, and siblings (trio analysis) or the entire family (whole-family analysis) can reveal inheritance patterns and identify causative mutations

==Treatment==
Available treatment falls into two modalities: treating infections and boosting the immune system.

Prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is useful in those who are immunocompromised. In the early 1950s Immunoglobulin(Ig) was used by doctors to treat patients with primary immunodeficiency through intramuscular injection. Ig replacement therapy are infusions that can be either subcutaneous or intravenously administered, resulting in higher Ig levels for about three to four weeks, although this varies with each patient.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis depends greatly on the nature and severity of the condition. Some deficiencies cause early mortality (before age one), others with or even without treatment are lifelong conditions that cause little mortality or morbidity. Newer stem cell transplant technologies may lead to gene based treatments of debilitating and fatal genetic immune deficiencies. Prognosis of acquired immune deficiencies depends on avoiding or treating the causative agent or condition (like AIDS).

<text>Jagannatha (; formerly ) is a deity worshipped in regional Hindu traditions in India as part of a triad along with his (Krishna&#x27;s) brother Balabhadra, and sister, Subhadra. Jagannath, within Odia Hinduism, is the supreme god, &quot;Purushottama&quot;, and the &quot;Para Brahman&quot;. To most Vaishnava Hindus, particularly the Krishnaites, Jagannath is a form of Krishna, sometimes as the avatar of Vishnu. To some Shaiva and Shakta Hindus, he is a symmetry-filled tantric form of Bhairava, a fierce manifestation of Shiva associated with annihilation.

The Jagannathism ( Odia Vaishnavism) — the particular sector of Jagannath as a major deity — emerged in the Early Middle Ages and later became an independent state regional temple-centered tradition of Krishnaism/Vaishnavism.

The idol of Jagannath is a carved and decorated wooden stump with large round eyes and a symmetric face, and the idol has a conspicuous absence of hands or legs. The worship procedures, sacraments and rituals associated with Jagannath are syncretic and include rites that are uncommon in Hinduism. Unusually, the icon is made of wood and replaced with a new one at regular intervals.

The origin and evolution of Jagannath worship is unclear. Some scholars interpret hymn 10.155.3 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; as a possible origin, but others disagree and state that it is a syncretic/synthetic deity with tribal roots. The English word &quot;juggernaut&quot; was the rendition into English of &quot;Jagannath&quot; by early British in India, and came to mean a very large and unstoppable force from accounts of the famous Ratha Yatra processions in Puri. 

Jagannath is considered a non-sectarian deity. He is significant regionally in the Indian states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Gujarat, Assam, Manipur and Tripura. He is also significant to the Hindus of Bangladesh. The Jagannath temple in Puri, Odisha is particularly significant in Vaishnavism, and is regarded as one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites in India. The Jagannath temple is massive, over high in the Nagara architecture style of Hindu temple architecture, and one of the best surviving specimens of Kalinga architecture, namely Odisha art and architecture. It has been one of the major pilgrimage destinations for Hindus since about 800 CE.

The annual festival called the Ratha yatra celebrated in June or July every year in eastern states of India is dedicated to Jagannath. His image, along with the other two associated deities, is ceremoniously brought out of the sacrosanctum (Garbhagruha) of his chief temple in Puri (, ). They are placed in a temple car which is then pulled by numerous volunteers to the Gundicha Temple (located at a distance of nearly ). They stay there for eight days, and on the 9th day they are returned to the main temple. Coinciding with the Ratha Yatra festival at Puri, similar processions are organized at Jagannath temples throughout the world. It falls on the Dwitiya Tithi, the second day of the bright fortnight of the Sharad Paksha, a fortnight of the Hindu lunar month of Asadh. During the festive public procession of Jagannath in Puri, hundreds of thousands of devotees visit Puri to see Jagganath in chariot.

==Etymology==

&quot;Jagannath&quot; is a Sanskrit word, compounded of &quot;jagat&quot; meaning &quot;universe&quot; and &quot;nātha&quot; meaning &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot;. Thus, &quot;Jagannath&quot; means &quot;lord of the universe&quot;.

In the Odia language, &quot;Jagannath&quot; is linked to other names, such as &quot;Jagā&quot; (ଜଗା) or &quot;Jagabandhu&quot; (ଜଗବନ୍ଧୁ) (&quot;Friend of the Universe&quot;). Both names derive from &quot;Jagannath&quot;. Further, on the basis of the physical appearance of the deity, names like &quot;Kalia&quot; (କାଳିଆ) (&quot;The Black-coloured Lord&quot;, but which can also mean &quot;the Timely One&quot;), &quot;Darubrahman&quot; (ଦାରୁବ୍ରହ୍ମ) (&quot;The Sacred Wood-Riddle&quot;), &quot;Dāruēdebatā&quot; ( &quot;The wooden god&quot;), Chakā ākhi () or &quot;Chakānayan&quot; ( &quot;With round eyes&quot;), &quot;Cakāḍōḷā&quot; ( &quot;with round pupils&quot;) are also in vogue.

According to Dina Krishna Joshi, the word may have origins in the tribal word &quot;Kittung&quot; of the Sora people (Savaras). This hypothesis states that the Vedic people as they settled into tribal regions adopted the tribal words and called the deity Jagannath. According to O.M. Starza, this is unlikely because &quot;Kittung&quot; is phonetically unrelated, and the &quot;Kittung&quot; tribal deity is produced from burnt wood and looks very different from Jagannath.

==Iconography==

The icon of Jagannath in his temples is a brightly painted, rough-hewn log of &quot;neem&quot; wood. The image consists of a square flat head, a pillar that represents his face merging with the chest. The icon lacks a neck, ears, and limbs, is identified by a large circular face symbolizing someone who is &quot;anadi&quot; (without beginning) and &quot;ananta&quot; (without end). Within this face are two big symmetric circular eyes with no eyelids, one eye symbolizing the sun and the other the moon, features traceable in 17th-century paintings. He is shown with an &quot;Urdhva Pundra&quot;, the Vaishnava U-shaped mark on his forehead. His dark color and other facial features are an abstraction of the cosmic form of the Hindu god Krishna, states Starza. In some contemporary Jagannath temples, two stumps pointing forward in an embracing position represent his hands. In some exceptional medieval and modern era paintings in museums outside India, such as in Berlin states Starza, Jagannath is shown &quot;fully anthropomorphised&quot; but with the traditional abstract mask face.

The typical icon of Jagannath is unlike other deities found in Hinduism who are predominantly anthropomorphic. However, aniconic forms of Hindu deities are not uncommon. For example, Shiva is often represented in the form of a Shiva linga. In most Jagannath temples in the eastern states of India, and all his major temples such as the Puri, Odisha, Jagannath is included with his brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra. Apart from the principal companion deities, the Jagannath icon shows a Sudarshana Chakra and sometimes under the umbrella cover of multiheaded Sesha Naga, both linking him to Vishnu. 
When shown with Balabhadra and Subhadra, he is identifiable from his circular eyes compared to the oval or almond shape of the other two abstract icons. Further, his icon is dark, while Balabhadra&#x27;s face is white, and Subhadra&#x27;s icon is yellow. The third difference is the flat head of Jagannath icon, compared to semi-circular carved heads of the other two. They are accompanied by the Sudarshana Chakra, the iconic weapon of Vishnu. It is approximately the same height as Balabhadra, is red in colour, carved from a wooden pillar and clothed, unlike its traditional representation as a chakra in other Vishnu temples. Jagannath iconography, when he is depicted without companions, shows only his face, neither arms nor torso. This form is sometimes called Patita Pavana, or &quot;Dadhi Vaman&quot;.

The &quot;murtis&quot; of Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra and Sudarshana Chakra are made of &quot;neem&quot; wood. Neem wood is chosen because the Bhavishya Purana declares it to be the most auspicious wood from which to make Vishnu &quot;murtis&quot;. The idol of Jagannatha, Balabhadra, Subhadra and Sudarshana is re-painted every week in the Jagannatha Temple, Puri. It is replaced with a newly carved image every 12 or 19 years approximately, or more precisely according to the luni-solar Hindu calendar when its month of Asadha occurs twice in the same year.

===Attributes===
In the Jagannath tradition (Odia Vaishnavism), Jagannath is most frequently identified with an abstract form of Krishna as the supreme deity.

Jagannath is considered as equivalent to the Hindu metaphysical concepts of Brahman/Para Brahman and Purushottama/Shunya Purusha, wherein he then is the Avatarī, i.e., the cause and equivalence of all avatars and the infinite existence in space and time. According to author Dipti Ray in &quot;Prataparudra Deva&quot;, the Suryavamsi King of Odisha:

In the Jagannath tradition, he has the attributes of all the avatars of Krishna/Vishnu. This belief is celebrated by dressing him and worshipping him as different avatars on special occasions. The Puranas relate that the Narasimha Avatar of Vishnu appeared from a wooden pillar. It is therefore believed that Jagannath is worshipped as a wooden &quot;murti&quot; or Daru Brahma with the Shri Narasimha hymn dedicated to the Narasimha Avatar. Every year in the month of Bhadra, Jagannath is dressed and decorated in the form of the Vamana avatar of Vishnu. Jagannath appeared in the form of Rama, another avatar of Vishnu, to Tulsidas, who worshipped him as Rama and called him Raghunath during his visit to Puri in the 16th century.

Sometimes one regards him as one of the avatars (incarnations) of Krishna (i.e., Buddha-Jagannath) or Vishnu (i.e., Vamana). His name does not appear in the traditional Dashavatara (ten avatars) of Vishnu, though in certain Odia literature, Jagannath has been treated as the avatar of Krishna, as a substitute for or the equivalent of the avatar Buddha from Dashavatara.

===Tantric deity===
Outside Vaishnava tradition, Jagannath is considered the epitome of Tantric worship. The symmetry in iconography, the use of mandalas and geometric patterns in its rites support the tantric connection proposal.

Jagannath is venerated as Bhairava or Shiva, the consort of the goddess Vimala, by Shaivites and Shakta sects. The priests of Jagannath Temple at Puri belong to the Shakta sect, although the Vaishnava sect&#x27;s influence predominates. As part of the triad, Balabhadra is also considered to be Shiva and Subhadra, a manifestation of Durga. In the Markandeya Purana the sage Markandeya declared that Purushottama Jagannath and Shiva are one. Jagannath in his Hathi Besha or Gaja Besha (elephant form) has been venerated by devotees like Ganapati Bappa of Maharashtra as Ganesha.

==Origins==

===Skanda Purana===
According to the &quot;Purushottama Kshetra Mahatmya&quot; (part of &quot;Vaiṣṇava Khaṇḍa&quot;, a later 12th century addition to the Skanda Purana) of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, the deity Yama requested Vishnu to disappear from the region of Purushottama Kshetra, dissatisfied with the direct salvation of those who lived in the region. Vishnu agreed to do so. Indradyumna, the king of Avanti, grew interested in venerating the deity Nilamadhava, made of sapphire. He is described to have sent the younger brother of his royal priest, or sometimes a minister, Vidyapati, to locate the site of the deity&#x27;s image in the Nilagiri region. Regional folklore states that the priest was welcomed by Vishvavasu, the chieftain of the Savara people. During the duration of his stay in the chieftain&#x27;s house, the latter&#x27;s daughter, Lalita, fell in love with him. Upon the chieftain&#x27;s request, Vidyapati married her. He noticed that the chieftain would leave the house every evening, and only return the following noon. At his urging, Lalita revealed to him that these were her father&#x27;s visits to the shrine of Nilamadhava, whose location was held secret within the community. Vidyapati persuaded his wife to ask Vishvavasu to take him along to see the image of the deity. The chieftain agreed to take Vidyapati with him, but on the condition that he be blindfolded during the journey so that the shrine&#x27;s location remained undisclosed. Lalita helped her husband devise a plan: Vidyapati brought a bag of mustard seeds with him, scattering them all along the path to the shrine present in a cave, bearing witness to the deep blue image of Nilamadhava. Returning to Avanti, he reported his discovery of the shrine to Indradyumna. After a few months, following the mustards seeds that had since germinated into plants, the king and his retinue travelled to the shrine, unable to locate the image. After praying to Vishnu for three days and nights, they heard the deity&#x27;s voice thunder from the heavens, rebuking them for their scheme and informing them of his omnipresence. He announced that he would manifest as a &quot;dāru&quot; (wooden image) floating by the sea. He instructed them to construct a new temple upon a mountain that stood beside the seashore for his worship.
In the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, by the time Vidyapati returned to inform the king of the site of the shrine, a great storm had buried the image of Nilamadhava under the sand. Despite his best attempts, the king was unable to locate the image. Upon the counsel of the sage divinity Narada, Indradyumna constructed a new temple, and performed a thousand ashvamedha yajnas at the site. Receiving guidance in the form of a divine dream, a great tree floating in the sea was felled and used to create the three wooden images of the temple, those of Jagannatha, Balarama, and Subhadra. The king travelled to Brahmaloka to invite Brahma to inaugurate the temple. With the passage of time, a king named Gala claimed to have been the temple&#x27;s real architect, but with the return of Indradyumna to earth, he withdrew this claim. After Brahma had inaugurated the temple, Indradyumna returned to Brahmaloka, entrusting the upkeep of the site to Gala.

===Vedic origin of Jagannath===
In hymn 10.155 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, there is mention of a Daru (wooden log) floating in the ocean as &quot;apurusham&quot;. Acharya Sayana interpreted the term &quot;apurusham&quot; as same as &quot;Purushottama&quot; and this &quot;Dara&quot; wood log being an inspiration for Jagannath, thus placing the origin of Jagannath in 2nd millennium BCE. Other scholars refute this interpretation stating that the correct context of the hymn is &quot;Alaxmi Stava&quot; of Arayi.

According to Bijoy Misra, Puri natives do call Jagannatha as Purushottama, consider driftwood a savior symbol, and later Hindu texts of the region describe the Supreme Being as ever present in everything, pervasive in all animate and inanimate things. Therefore, while the Vedic connection is subject to interpretation, the overlap in the ideas exist.

===Buddhist origins===
Theories suggesting Buddhist origins of Jagannatha stems from the relic worship associated with Jagannatha, a concept integral to Buddhism but alien to Hinduism. For example, there exists an unexamined relic in the Jagannath shrine in Puri, and the local legends state that the shrine relic contains a tooth of Gautama Buddha – a feature common to many cherished Theravada Buddhist shrines in and outside India. According to &quot;Datha-dhatu-vamsa&quot;, as mentioned in &quot;Culavamsa&quot;, Buddha&#x27;s left canine tooth was handed over to Brahmadatta by a disciple, which eventually gave rise to dissensions between the kings of Kalinga and Pataliputra in 3rd century CE, and the tooth relic was shifted to Sri Lanka by weighing anchor in Tamralipta. According to Ganguly, it is absurd to imagine that the prince chose the farthest harbor from the capital even though there were intermediate harbors from which it would have been easier to set out on his voyage. Buddhism anciently prevailed in Odisha as appears from the Buddhist remains still existing. The idols of Jagannatha is believed to contain the bones of Krishna even though it forms no part of the Brahmanical religion to collect and adore dead men&#x27;s bones while it is a most meritorious act among the Buddhists to collect and preserve the relics of departed saints, and the places that contain them are esteemed peculiarly holy. In Buddhism, preserving cetiya or skeletal parts such as &quot;Buddha&#x27;s tooth&quot; or relics of dead saints is a thriving tradition. The existence of these legends, state some scholars such as Stevenson, suggests that Jagannath may have a Buddhist origin.

Another evidence that links Jagannath deity to Buddhism is the &quot;Ratha-Yatra&quot; festival for Jagannath, the stupa-like shape of the temple and a dharmachakra-like discus (&quot;chakra&quot;) at the top of the spire. The major annual procession festival has many features found in the Mahayana Buddhism traditions. Faxian (c. 400 CE), the ancient Chinese pilgrim and visitor to India wrote about a Buddhist procession in his memoir, and this has very close resemblances with the Jagannath festivities. Further the season in which the &quot;Ratha-Yatra&quot; festival is observed is about the same time when the historic public processions welcomed Buddhist monks for their temporary, annual monsoon-season retirement.

There is no distinction of caste inside the Jagganath temple, many day-to-day services (Vidhis) of Lord Jagannatha owe their origin either to Jainism or to Buddhism or the combination of both, the local legends link the idols with aboriginal tribes and the &quot;daitapatis&quot; (servitors) claim to be descendants of the aboriginals. Majority of rituals are based on Oddiyana Tantras which are the refined versions of Mahayana Tantras as well as Shabari Tantras which are evolved from Tantric Buddhism and tribal believes respectively. According to Starza, these practices are also connected to Tantric practices.

Buddha was assimilated as Vishnu&#x27;s ninth avatar in &quot;Vishnu Puran&quot; as a divinely incarnated purveyor of illusion. It states that Vishnu&#x27;s &quot;descent&quot; as the &quot;Buddhavatara&quot; was accomplished so that the wicked and demonic could be only further misled away from the truth in &quot;kali yuga&quot;. This assimilation and the consequent disingenuous interpretation or rationale for his inclusion aptly articulate the considerable ambivalence characteristic of Hindu attitudes towards Buddhism, undermining his historicity, to make him an appendage of the Vaisnava mythic hierarchy. But in the opening chapter of his Gita Govinda, the poet Jayadeva claims that Vishnu reincarnated as the Buddha to condemn the animal sacrifices prevalent in Vedic times. In the Jagannath cult, Jagannath is sometimes represented as the ninth avatar of Vishnu substituting Buddha, when it could have been substituted for any other avatar.

According to Starza, these manifestation of the Jagannath cult, such as the supposed tooth relic of Buddha, the &quot;Ratha-Yatra&quot;, the absence of caste rules in the temple and the identification of Jagannath with Buddha avatar are not sufficient to establish a Buddhist origin of the worship of Jagannath.

Indrabhuti, the ancient Buddhist king of Oddiyana, describes Jagannath as a Buddhist deity in &quot;Jñānasiddhi&quot;. This is the oldest known direct mention of the deity. This is not unique to the coastal state of Odisha, but possibly also influenced Buddhism in Nepal and Tibet. Shakyamuni Buddha is also worshipped as Jagannath in Nepal. Abhinav Patra argues that it has not been historically ascertained whether the deity Jagannath as worshipped by Indrabhuti was just a coincidental homonym with the present Jagannath or referred to the same deity. The 10th century era text Kubjikāmatatantra, mentions &quot;Viraja&quot; (ancient capital of Utkala) as the goddess of Oddiyana, with which Indrabhuti&#x27;s son Padmasambhava is associated with. The &quot;Saddharmapundarika&quot; records a prophecy in which the Lord assures Śāriputra, that he would be in a distant future time a Buddha under the name of Padmaprabha, and that his place of enlightenment would be Viraja. Padmasambhava and Tārā, along with other deities are invoked in an inscription of 25 lines incised in nail-headed characters of the late 8th-9th century on the back of an image of Lokeśvara/Mahākaruṇā at Udaygiri not far from Jajpur, which states that a &quot;stupa&quot; with a relic inside and dwelt in by the Tathāgata was set up on that very spot. The stupa is believed to have contained the relics of Padmasambhava. Though the site is only partially excavated, at least one stupa has been unearthed. According to Nabin Kumar Sahu, this mass of evidence, supports the belief that Indrabhuti was the king of Odisha which is same as Oddiyana or Odra-&quot;pitha&quot;, of which the main deities are Jagganath and Viraja.

Some scholars argue that evidences of Jagannatha&#x27;s Buddhist nature are found from Medieval Odia Literature. Many medieval Odia poets suggest to their readers, that they wrote their books on the commands of a formless god-like personality, identifying the Buddhist principles of &quot;Sunya&quot; (The great void) and &quot;Alekha&quot; (The formless one) with Jagannath himself. The idols of Jagannath triad are not anthropomorphic like Hindu idols, but instead are stumps of wood with crude symbolic facial features and stumpy obtrusions for limbs.

Odia poet Sarala Dasa of 15th century in his Mahabharata describes Jagannatha as Buddha but not as any other avatar of Vishnu:


===Jain origins===
Pandit Nilakantha Das suggested that Jagannath was a deity of Jain origin because of the appending of &quot;Nath&quot; to many Jain Tirthankars. He felt Jagannath meant the &#x27;World personified&#x27; in the Jain context and was derived from &quot;Jinanath&quot;. Evidence of the Jain terminology such as of Kaivalya, which means moksha or salvation, is found in the Jagannath tradition. Similarly, the twenty two steps leading to the temple, called the &quot;Baisi Pahacha&quot;, have been proposed as symbolic reverence for the first 22 of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism.

According to Annirudh Das, the original Jagannath deity was influenced by Jainism and is none other than the &quot;Jina&quot; of Kalinga taken to Magadha by Mahapadma Nanda. The theory of Jain origins is supported by the Jain Hathigumpha inscription. It mentions the worship of a relic memorial in Khandagiri-Udayagiri, on the Kumara hill. This location is stated to be same as the Jagannath temple site. However, states Starza, a Jain text mentions the Jagannath shrine was restored by Jains, but the authenticity and date of this text is unclear.

Another circumstantial evidence supporting the Jain origins proposal is the discovery of Jain images inside as well as near the massive Puri temple complex, including those carved into the walls. However, this could also be a later addition, or suggestive of tolerance, mutual support or close relationship between the Jains and the Hindus. According to Starza, the Jain influence on the Jagannath tradition is difficult to assess given the sketchy uncertain evidence, but nothing establishes that the Jagannath tradition has a Jain origin.

=== Vaishnava origins ===

The Vaishnava origin theories rely on the iconographic details and the typical presence of the triad of deities, based on original scriptures of Hinduism. The colors, state the scholars of the Vaishnava origin theory, link to black-colored Krishna and white-colored Balarama. They add that the goddess originally was Ekanamsa (Durga of Shaiva-Shakti tradition, sister of Krishna through his foster family). She was later renamed to Shubhadra (Lakshmi) per Vaishnava terminology for the divine feminine.

It is certainly true that the Vaishnava Hindus in the eastern region of India worshipped the triad of Balarama, Ekanamsa and Krishna. There are many scriptural references to support the same. Further, in many Jagannath temples of central and eastern regions of India, the Shiva icons such as the Linga-yoni are reverentially incorporated, since Lord Shiva is a Vaishnav according to the conclusion of Srimad Bhagavatam, he protects Sri Jagannath Temple from external calamities, just like he does so in his form of Hanuman for the palace of Sri Ram.

===Tribal origins===

The tribal origin theories rely on circumstantial evidence and inferences such as the Jagannath icon is non-anthropomorphic and non-zoomorphic. The hereditary priests in the Jagannath tradition of Hinduism include non-Brahmin servitors, called &quot;Daitas&quot;, which may be an adopted grandfathered practice with tribal roots. The use of wood as a construction material for the Jagannath icons may also be a tribal practice that continued when Hindus adopted prior practices and merged them with their Vedic abstractions. The practice of using wood for making &quot;murti&quot; is unusual, as Hindu texts on the design and construction of images recommend stone or metal. The &quot;Daitas&quot; are Hindu, but believed to have been the ancient tribe of &quot;Sabaras&quot; (also spelled &quot;Soras&quot;). They continue to have special privileges such as being the first to view the new replacement images of Jagannath carved from wood approximately every 12 years. Further, this group is traditionally accepted to have the exclusive privilege of serving the principal meals and offerings to Jagannath and his associate deities.

According to Verrier Elwin, a convert to Hinduism, Jagannatha in a local legend was a tribal deity who was coopted by a Brahmin priest. The original tribal deity, states Elwin, was &quot;Kittung&quot; which too is made from wood. According to the Polish Indologist Olgierd M. Starza, this is an interesting parallel but a flawed one because the &quot;Kittung&quot; deity is produced by burning a piece of wood and too different in its specifics to be the origin of Jagannath. According to another proposal by Stella Kramrisch, log as a symbol of &quot;Anga pen&quot; deity is found in central Indian tribes and they have used it to represent features of the Hindu goddess Kali with it. However, states Starza, this theory is weak because the &quot;Anga pen&quot; features a bird or snake like attached head along with other details that make the tribal deity unlike the Jagannath.
Some scholars such as Kulke and Tripathi have proposed tribal deities such as Stambhesveri or Kambhesvari to be a possible contributor to the Jagannath triad. However, according to Starza, these are not really tribal deities, but Shaiva deities adopted by tribes in eastern states of India. Yet another proposal for tribal origins is through the medieval era cult of Lakshmi-Narasimha. This hypothesis relies on the unusual flat head, curved mouth and large eyes of Jagannath, which may be an attempt to abstract an image of a lion&#x27;s head ready to attack. While the tribal Narasimha theory is attractive states Starza, a weakness of this proposal is that the abstract Narasimha representation in the form does not appear similar to the images of Narasimha in nearby Konark and Kalinga temple artworks.

In contemporary Odisha, there are many Dadhivaman temples with a wooden pillar god, and this may be same as Jagannath.

===Syncretic origins===
According to H.S. Patnaik and others, Jagannath is a syncretic/synthetic deity that combined aspects of major faiths like Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, Jainism, and Buddhism. Krishnaite sampradayas, as example, Gaudiya Vaishnavas, have identified him strongly with Krishna. In Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, Balabhadra is the elder brother Balarama, Jagannath is the younger brother Krishna, and Subhadra is the youngest sister.

Balabhadra considered the elder brother of Jagannath is sometimes identified with and worshipped as Shiva. Subhadra now considered Jagannath&#x27;s sister has also been considered as a deity who used to be Brahma. Finally the fourth deity, Sudarshana Chakra symbolizes the wheel of the sun&#x27;s chariot, a syncretic absorption of the Saura (Surya-centric) tradition of Hinduism. The conglomerate of Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra, and Sudarshana Chakra worshipped together on a common platform are called the Chaturdhamurti or the &quot;four-fold form&quot;.

O.M. Starza states that the Jagannath Ratha Yatra may have evolved from the syncretism of procession rituals for Shiva lingas, Vaishnava pillars, and tribal folk festivities. The Shaiva element in the tradition of Jagannath overlap with the rites and doctrines of Tantrism and Shaktism. According to the Shaivas, Jagannath is Bhairava. The Shiva Purana mentions Jagannatha as one of the 108 names of Shiva. The Tantric literary texts identify Jagannath with Mahabhairava. Another evidence that supports syncretism thesis is the fact that Jagannath sits on the abstract tantric symbols of the Shri Yantra. Further, his Shri Chakra (&quot;holy wheel&quot;) is worshipped in the bijamantra &#x27;klim&#x27;, which is also the bijamantra of Kali or Shakti. The representation of Balarama as Sheshanaga or Sankarsana bears testimony to the influence of Shaivism on the cult of Jagannath. The third deity, Devi Subhadra, who represents the Sakti element is still worshipped with the Bhuvaneshvari Mantra.

The Tantric texts claim Jagannath to their own, to be Bhairava, and his companion to be the same as goddess Vimala is the Shakti. The offerings of Jagannath becomes &quot;mahaprasad&quot; only after it is re-offered to goddess Vimala. Similarly, different Tantric features of yantras have been engraved on the Ratna vedi, where Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra are set up. The Kalika Purana depicts Jagannath as a Tantric deity. According to Avinash Patra, the rituals and special place accepted for non-Brahmin &quot;Daitas&quot; priests in Jagannath tradition, who co-exist and work together with Brahmin priests suggests that there was a synthesis of tribal and Brahmanical traditions.

According to the Jain version, the image of Jagannath (black colour) represents sunya, Subhadra symbolises creative energy and Balabhadra (white colour) represents the phenomenal universe. All these images have evolved from the Nila Madhava, the ancient Kalinga Jina. The &quot;Sudarshana Chakra&quot; is contended to be the Hindu name of the Dharma Chakra of Jaina symbol.

In the words of the historian Jadunath Sarkar:
===Transformation from unitary icon to triad===

The Madala Panji observes that Nila Madhava transformed into Jagannath and was worshipped alone as a unitary figure, not as the part of a triad. It is significant to note that the early epigraphic and literary sources refer only to a unitary deity Purushottama Jagannath. The Sanskrit play &quot;Anargharaghava&quot; composed by Murari mentioned only Purushottama Jagannath and his consort Lakshmi with no references to Blabhadra and Subhadra. The Dasgoba copper plated inscription dating to 1198 also mentions only Purushottama Jagannath in the context that the Puri temple had been originally built by Ganga king Anantavarman Chodaganga (1078–1147) for Vishnu and Lakshmi. These sources are silent on the existence of Balabhadra and Subhadra. Such state of affairs has led to arguments that Purushottama was the original deity and Balabhadra and Subhadra were subsequently drawn in as additions to a unitary figure and formed a triad.

During the rule of Anangabhima III [1211–1239], Balabhadra and Subhadra find the earliest known mention in the Pataleshwara inscription of 1237 CE. According to the German Indologist Kulke, Anangibhima III was the originator of the triad of Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra suggesting that Balabhadra was added after Lakshmi&#x27;s transformation into Subhadra.

==Theology==
The theology and rituals associated with the Jagannatha tradition combine Vedic, Puranic and tantric themes. He is the Vedic-Puranic Purushottama (lit.: the Upper Person), as well as the Puranic Narayana and the tantric Bhairava. According to the &quot;Vishnudharma Purana&quot; (ca. 4th century), Krishna is worshipped in the form of Purushottama in Odra (Odisha). He is same as the metaphysical Para Brahman, the form of Krishna that prevades as abstract &quot;kāla&quot; (time) in Vaishnava thought. He is abstraction which can be inferred and felt but not seen, just like time. Jagannath is &quot;chaitanya&quot; (consciousness), and his companion Subhadra represent Shakti (energy) while Balabhadra represents Jnana (knowledge). According to Salabega, the Jagannath tradition assimilates the theologies found in Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, Buddhism, Yoga and Tantra traditions.

The Jagannath theology overlaps with those of Krishna. For example, the 17th-century Odia classic &quot;Rasa kallola&quot; by Dina Krushna opens with a praise to Jagannath, then recites the story of Krishna with an embedded theology urging the pursuit of knowledge, love and devotion to realize the divine in everything. The 13th-century &quot;Jagannatha vijaya&quot; in Kannada language by Rudrabhatta is a mixed prose and poetry style text which is predominantly about Krishna. It includes a canto that explains that &quot;Hari (Vishnu), Hara (Shiva) and Brahma&quot; are aspects of the same supreme soul. Its theology, like the Odia text, centers around supreme light being same as &quot;love in the heart&quot;. The 15th-century Bhakti scholar Shankaradeva of Assam became a devotee of Jagannatha in 1481, and wrote love and compassion inspired plays about Jagannatha-Krishna that influenced the region and remain popular in Assam and Manipur.

The medieval era Odia scholars such as Ananta, Achyutananda and Chaitanya described the theology of Jagannath as the &quot;personification of the Shunya, or the void&quot;, but not entirely in the form of Shunyata of Buddhism. They state Jagannath as &quot;Shunya Brahma&quot;, or alternatively as &quot;Nirguna Purusha&quot; (or &quot;abstract personified cosmos&quot;). Vishnu avatars are descend from this Shunya Brahma into human form to keep dharma.

==In Hindu texts and traditions==
Although Jagannath has been identified with other traditions in the past, He is now identified more with Vaishnava tradition. 
===Vaishnavite version===
The Skanda Purana and Brahma Purana have attributed the creation of the Jagannathpuri during the reign of Indradyumna, a pious king and an ascetic who ruled from Ujjain. According to the second legend, associated with the Vaishnavas, when Krishna ended the purpose of his Avatar with the illusionary death by Jara and his &quot;mortal&quot; remains were left to decay, some pious people saw the body, collected the bones and preserved them in a box. They remained in the box till it was brought to the attention of Indradyumna by Lord Vishnu himself who directed him to create the image or a murti of Jagannath from a log and consecrate the bones of Krishna in its belly. Then King Indradyumna appointed Vishwakarma, the architect of gods and a divine carpenter, to carve the murti of the deity from a log that would eventually wash up on the shore at Puri. Indradyumna commissioned Vishwakarma, who is also said to be the divine god himself in disguise. Vishwakarma accepted the commission on the condition that he could complete the work undisturbed and in private.

Everyone was anxious about the divine work, including King Indradyumna. After a fortnight of waiting, the king, anxious to see the deity, could not control his eagerness and visited the site where Vishwakarma was working. Soon enough, Vishwakarma became very upset and left the carving of the idol unfinished; the images were without hands and feet. The king was very perturbed by this development and appealed to Brahma for help. Brahma promised the King that the images which were carved would be deified as carved and would become famous. Following this promise, Indradyumna organized a function to formally deify the images and invited all gods to be present for the occasion. Brahma presided over the religions function as the chief priest and brought life (soul) to the image and fixed (opened) its eyes. This resulted in the images becoming famous and worshipped at Jagannath Puri in the well-known Jagannath Temple as a Kshetra (pilgrimage centre). It is, however, believed that the original images are in a pond near the temple.

===Stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharata===
According to Prabhat Nanda, the Valmiki &quot;Ramayana&quot; mentions Jagannath. Some believe that the mythical place where King Janak performed a yajna and tilled land to obtain Sita is the same as the area in which the Gundicha temple is situated in Puri, according to Suryanarayan Das. The Mahabharata, states Das, describes King Indradyumna&#x27;s Ashvamedh Yajna and the advent of the four deities of the Jagannath cult.

===Sarala Dasa Mahabharata version===
Sarala Dasa, the great Odia poet of the 15th century while praising Jagannath as the saviour of mankind considered him both as a form of Buddha as well as a manifestation of Krishna.

===Kanchi conquest===
One of the most popular legends associated with Jagannath is that of &quot;Kanchi Avijana&quot; (or &quot;Conquest of Kanchi&quot;), also termed as &quot;Kanchi-Kaveri&quot;. According to the legends, the daughter of the King of Kanchi was betrothed to the Gajapati of Puri. When the Kanchi King witnessed the Gajapati King sweeping the area in front of where the chariots of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were kept during Ratha yatra, he was aghast. Considering the act of sweeping unworthy of a King, the King of Kanchi declined the marriage proposal, refusing to marry his daughter to a &#x27;Sweeper&#x27;. Gajapati Purushottam Deva, felt deeply insulted at this and attacked the Kingdom of Kanchin to avenge his honour. His attack was unsuccessful and his army defeated by the Kanchi Army.

Upon defeat, the Gajapati King Purushottam Deva returned and prayed to Jagannath, the God of land of Kalinga before planning a second campaign to Kanchi. Moved by his prayers, Jagannath and Balabhadra, left their temple in Puri and started an expedition to Kanchi on horseback. It is said that Jagannath rode on a white horse and Balabhadra on a black horse. The legend has such a powerful impact on the Oriya culture that the simple mention of white horse-black horse evokes the imagery of Kanchi conquest of the God in devotees minds.
On the road, Jagannath and Balabhadra grew thirsty and chanced upon a milkmaid Manika, who gave them butter-milk/yogurt to quench their thirst. Instead of paying her dues, Balabhadra gave her a ring telling her to claim her dues from King Purushottam. Later, Purushottam Deva himself passed by with his army. At Adipur near Chilika lake, the milkmaid Manika halted the King pleading for the unpaid cost of yogurt consumed by His army&#x27;s two leading soldiers riding on black and white horses. She produced the gold ring as evidence. King Purusottam Deva identified the ring as that of Jagannath. Considering this a sign of divine support for his campaign, the king enthusiastically led the expedition.

In the war between the army of Kalinga inspired by the Divine support of Jagannath and of the army of Kanchi, Purushottam Deva led his army to victory. King Purusottam brought back the Princess Padmavati of Kanchi to Puri. To avenge his humiliation, he ordered his minister to get the princess married to a sweeper. The minister waited for the annual Ratha Yatra when the King ceremonially sweeps Jagannath&#x27;s chariot. He offered the princess in marriage to King Purusottam, calling the King a Royal sweeper of God. The King then married the Princess. The Gajapati King also brought back images of Uchchhishta Ganesh (Bhanda Ganesh or Kamada Ganesh) and enshrined them in the Kanchi Ganesh shrine at the Jagannath Temple in Puri.

This myth has been recounted by Mohanty. J.P. Das notes that this story is mentioned in a Madala panji chronicle of the Jagannath Temple of Puri, in relation to Gajapati Purushottama. At any rate, the story was popular soon after Purushottama&#x27;s reign, as a text of the first half of the 16th century mentions a Kanchi Avijana scene in the Jagannath temple. There is currently a prominent relief in the &quot;jaga mohan&quot; (prayer hall) of the Jagannath temple of Puri that depicts this scene.

In modern culture, Kanchi Vijaya is a major motif in Odissi dance.

In Odia literature, the Kanchi conquest (Kanchi Kaveri) has significant bearing, in medieval literature romanticized as the epic Kanchi Kaveri by Purushottama Dasa in the 17th century and a work by the same name by Maguni Dasa. The first Odia drama written by Ramashankar Ray, the father of Odia drama in 1880 is &quot;Kanchi Kaveri&quot;.

The Kanchi Kingdom has been identified as the historical Vijayanagar Kingdom. As per historical records, Gajapati Purushottam Deva&#x27;s expedition towards Virupaksha Raya II&#x27;s Kanchi (Vijayanagar) Kingdom started during 1476 with Govinda Bhanjha as commander-in-chief. According to J. P. Das, the historicity of Kanchi conquest event is not certain.

===Early Vaishnava traditions===
Vaishnavism is considered a more recent tradition in Odisha, being historically traceable to the Early Middle Ages. Already, according to the &quot;Vishnudharma Purana&quot; (ca. 4th century), Krishna is woshipped in the form of Purushottama in Odra (Odisha).

Ramanuja, the great Vaishnav reformer, visited Puri between 1107 and 1111 converting the King Ananatavarman Chodaganga from Shaivism to Vaishnavism. At Puri he founded the Ramanuja Math for propagating Vaishnavism in Odisha. The Alarnatha Temple stands testimony to his stay in Odisha. Since the 12th century, under the influence of Ramanuja, Jagannath culture was increasingly identified with Vaishnavism.

Under the rule of the Eastern Gangas, Vaishnavism became the predominant faith in Odisha. Odia Vaishnavism gradually centred on Jagannath as the principal deity. Sectarian differences were eliminated by assimilating deities of Shaivism, Shaktism, and Buddhism in the Jagannath Pantheon. The Ganga Kings respected all the ten avatars of Vishnu, considering Jagannath as the cause of all the avatars.

The Vaishnava saint Nimbarkacharya visited Puri, establishing the Radhavallav Matha in 1268. The famous poet Jayadeva was a follower of Nimbaraka, with a focus on Radha and Krishna. Jayadev&#x27;s composition &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; put a new emphasis on the concept of Radha and Krishna in East Indian Vaishnavism. And the Jagannath Temple, Puri became a place where for the first time the famous Krishnaite poem &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; was introduced into the liturgy. This idea soon became popular. Sarala Dasa in his adaptation of the Mahabharat thought of Jagannath as the universal being equating him with Buddha and Krishna. He considered Buddha-Jagannath as one of the avatars of Krishna. Sometimes Jagannath is venerated as Vamana, the avatar of Vishnu.

In the 16th century, the worship of Gopal (Krishna), associated with Jagannath, had already flourished in Odisha. Thus the raja Languliya Narasimha Deva installed the image called &quot;Gopinath&quot; with eight figures of gopi. During Hera-Panchami festival, Jagannath is regarded as Krishna.

===Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Gaudiya Vaishnavism===

Gaudiya Vaishnavism is a Vaishnava religious movement founded by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the 16th century. &quot;Gaudiya&quot; refers to the &quot;Gauda region&quot; (present day Bengal/Bangladesh) with Vaishnavism meaning &quot;the worship of the monotheistic Deity or Supreme Personality of Godhead, often addressed as Krishna, Narayana or Vishnu&quot;.

The focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (&quot;bhakti&quot;) of Krishna, as &quot;Svayam Bhagavan&quot; or the Original Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Jagannath is widely revered in Bengal. The event of the Ratha Yatra is celebrated in West Bengal, and the day also marks the beginning of preparations for Bengal&#x27;s biggest religious festival, the Durga Puja. The popularity of Jagannath among Bengalis is attributed to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu emphasised bhakti and encouraged the identification of Jagannath with Krishna. He spent the last 20 years of his life in Puri dedicating it to the ecstatic worship of Jagannath, whom he considered a form of Krishna. Mahaprabhu propagated the Sankirtan movement which laid great emphasis on chanting God&#x27;s name in Puri. He converted noted scholars like Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya to his philosophy. He left a great influence on the then king of Odisha, Prataprudra Deva, and the people of Odisha. According to tradition, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is said to have merged with the idol of Jagannath in Puri after his death.

===The ISKCON Movement===

Soon after its founding, ISKCON started founding temples in the West. A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada popularly called Shrila Prabhupada, the founder of ISKCON, selected Jagannath as one of the chosen forms of Krishna installing a deity of Jagannath in ISKCON temples around the world. ISKCON has promoted Jagannath throughout the world. Annual Ratha Yatra festival is now celebrated by ISKCON in many cities in the West where they are popular attractions. ISKCON devotees worship Jagannath and take part in the Ratha Yatra in memory of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu spending 18 years in Puri worshipping Jagannath and taking an active part in the Ratha Yatra.

===Jagannath in Shaktism===
Vimala (Bimala) is worshipped as the presiding goddess of the Purushottama (Puri) Shakti Pitha by Shaktas.Jagannath, is worshipped as the Bhairava, traditionally always a form of Shiva. Jagannath-Vishnu equated with Shiva, is interpreted to convey the oneness of God. Also, in this regard, Vimala is also considered as Annapurna, the consort of Shiva. Conversely, Tantrics consider Jagannath as Shiva-Bhairava, rather than a form of Vishnu. While Lakshmi is the traditional (orthodox tradition) consort of Jagannath, Vimala is the Tantric (heterodox) consort. Vimala is also considered the guardian goddess of the temple complex, with Jagannath as the presiding god.

Jagannath is considered the combination of 5 Gods Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Ganesh and Durga by Shaktas. When Jagannath has his divine slumber (Sayana Yatra) he is believed to assume the aspect of Durga. According to the &quot;Niladri Mahodaya&quot; Idol of Jagannath is placed on the Chakra Yantra, the idol of Balabhadra on the Shankha Yantra and the idol of Subhadra on the Padma Yantra.

==Jagannath and other religions==

===Jagannath and Islam===
During the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire era, Jagannath temples were one of the targets of the Muslim armies. Firuz Tughlaq, for example raided Odisha and desecrated the Jagannath temple according to his court historians. Odisha was one of the last eastern regions to fall into the control of Sultanates and Mughal invasion, and they were among the earliest to declare independence and break away. According to Starza, the Jagannath images were the targets of the invaders, and a key religious symbol that the rulers would protect and hide away in forests from the aggressors. However, the Muslims were not always destructive. For example, during the rule of Akbar, the Jagannath tradition flourished. However, states Starza, &quot;Muslim attacks on the Puri temple became serious after the death of Akbar, continued intermittently throughout the reign of Jahangir&quot;.

The local Hindu rulers evacuated and hid the images of Jagannath and other deities many times between 1509 and 1734 CE, to &quot;protect them from Muslim zeal&quot; for destruction. During Aurangzeb&#x27;s time, an image was seized, shown to the emperor and then destroyed in Bijapur, but it is unclear if that image was of Jagannath. Muslim rulers did not destroy the Jagannath temple complex because it was a source of substantial treasury revenue through the collection of pilgrim tax collected from Hindus visiting it on their pilgrimage.

===Jagannath and Sikhism===
In 1506 or 1508Guru Nanak the founder of Sikhism made a pilgrimage to Puri to visit to Jagannath. during his journey (called &quot;udaasi&quot;) to east India. The Sikh Aarti Gagan mai thaal was recited by him at the revered Jagannath Temple, Puri. This arti is sung (not performed with platter and lamps etc.) daily after recitation of Rehraas Sahib &amp; Ardās at the Harmandir Sahib, Amritsar and at most Gurudwara sahibs.

Later Sikh gurus like Guru Teg Bahadur also visited Jagannath Puri. It is said that Maharaja Ranjit Singh the famous 19th-century Sikh ruler of Punjab held great respect in Jagannath, and allegedly willed his most prized possession, the Koh-i-Noor diamond, to Jagannath in Puri, while on his deathbed in 1839.

=== Jagannath and Christianity ===

For Christian missionaries who arrived through the ports of eastern states of India such as Calcutta in the 18th- and 19th-centuries, Jagannath was the &quot;core of idolatry&quot; and the target of &quot;an all-out attack&quot;. Jagannath, called &quot;Juggernaut&quot; by the Christian missionary Claudius Buchanan, was through Buchanan&#x27;s letters the initial introduction in America of Hinduism, which he spelled as &quot;Hindoo&quot;. According to Michael J. Altman, a professor of Religious Studies, Buchanan presented Hinduism to the American audience, through &quot;Juggernaut&quot;, as a &quot;bloody, violent, superstitious and backward religious system&quot; that needs to be eliminated and substituted with the Christian gospel. He described &quot;Juggernaut&quot; with Biblical terminology for his audience, called him the Moloch, and his shrine as Golgatha – the place where Jesus Christ was crucified, but with the difference that the &quot;Juggernaut tradition&quot; was of endless meaningless bloodshed, fabricating allegations that children were sacrificed in the &quot;valley of idolatrous blood shed to false gods&quot;. In his letters, states Altman, Buchanan &quot;constructed an image of Juggernaut as the diametric opposite of Christianity&quot;.

These views are picked up in Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s posthumous poetical illustration to The Temple of Juggernaut, a picture by Alfred Gomersal Vickers. However, she counters them not so much with hostility, as with the Christian doctrine of &#x27;Faith, Hope, and Love&#x27;. 
In his book &quot;Christian Researches in Asia&quot;, published in 1811, Buchanan built on this theme and added licentiousness to it. He called hymns in language he did not know nor could read as &quot;obscene stanzas&quot;, art works on temple walls as &quot;indecent emblems&quot;, and described &quot;Juggernaut&quot; and Hinduism to his American readers as the religion of disgusting Moloch and false gods. Buchanan writings formed the &quot;first images of Indian religions&quot; to the American evangelical audience in early 19th-century, was promoted by American magazines such as The Panoplist and his book on &quot;Juggernaut&quot; attracted enough reader demand that it was republished in numerous editions. Buchanan&#x27;s writings on &quot;Juggernaut&quot; influenced the American imagination of Indian religions for another 50 years, formed the initial impressions and served as a template for reports by other missionaries who followed Buchanan in India for most of the 19th century. According to William Gribbin and other scholars, Buchanan&#x27;s Juggernaut metaphor is a troublesome example of intercultural misunderstanding and constructed identity. Ujaan Ghosh, however, argues that these misrepresentations of &quot;Juggernaut&quot; and the deity&#x27;s demonization were not homogeneous throughout the nineteenth century. Gradually global perception of the deity were more humanized. Several European authors, such as W.W. Hunter and James Fergusson went to great lengths to revise Buchanan&#x27;s perception and presented a more humane version of Jagannatha to British and American audience.

Due to persistent attacks from non-Indic religions, even to this day, devotees of only Dharmic religions are allowed entry in the Jagannath puri temple.

==Influence==
The English traveller William Burton visited the Jagannath temple. According to Avinash Patra, Burton made absurd observations in 1633 that are inconsistent with all historical and contemporary records, such as the image of Jagannatha being &quot;a serpent, with seven heads&quot;. Burton described it as &quot;the mirror of all wickedness and idolatry&quot; to the Europeans, an introduction of Hinduism as &quot;monstrous paganism&quot; to early travellers to the Indian subcontinent. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier never saw the Puri temple icon and its decorations, but described the jewelry worn by the idol from hearsay accounts. François Bernier mentioned the Puri chariot festival, in his 1667 memoir, but did not describe the icon of Jagannath raising the question whether he was able to see it.

According to Kanungo, states Goldie Osuri, the Jagannath tradition has been a means of legitimizing royalty. Codaganga, a benevolent ruler of the Kalinga region (now Odisha and nearby regions), built the extant Puri temple. Kanungo states that this endeavor was an attempt by him to establish his agency, and he extrapolates this practice into late medieval and modern era developments. According to him, Muslim rulers attempted to control it for the same motivation, thereafter the Marathas, then East India Company and then the British crown over the colonial era sought to legitimize its influence and hegemonic control in the region by appropriating control over the Jagannath temple and affiliating themselves with the deities.

Jagannath became an influential figure and icon for power and politics during the 19th-century colonialism and Christian missionary activity, states Osuri. The British government initially took over the control and management of major Jagannath temples, to collect fees and Pilgrim Tax from Hindu who arrived from all over the Indian subcontinent to visit. In contrast, Christian missionaries strongly opposed the British government association with Jagannath temple because its connected the government with idolatry, or the &quot;worship of false god&quot;. Between 1856 and 1863, the British government accepted the missionary demand and handed over the Jagannath temples to the Hindus. According to Cassels and Mukherjee, the British rule documents suggest that the handing over was more motivated by the growing Hindu agitation against the Pilgrim Tax that they considered as discriminatory targeting based on religion, and rising corruption among the British officials and their Indian assistants, in the handling of collected tax.

To colonial era Hindu nationalists in the late 19th-century and 20th-century, Jagannath became a unifying symbol which combined their religion, social and cultural heritage into a political cause of self-rule and freedom movement.

==Festivals==

A large number of traditional festivals are observed by the devotees of Jagannath. Out of those numerous festivals, thirteen are important.

# Niladri Mahodaya
# Snana Yatra
# Ratha Yatra or Shri Gundicha Yatra
# Shri Hari Sayana
# Utthapana Yatra
# Parswa Paribartana
# Dakhyinayana Yatra
# Prarabana Yatra
# Pusyabhisheka
# Uttarayana
# Dola Yatra
# Damanaka Chaturdasi 
# Chandan Yatra

Ratha Yatra is most significant of all festivals of Jagannath.

===Ratha Yatra===
The Jagannatha triad are usually worshipped in the sanctum of the temple, but once during the month of Asadha (rainy season of Odisha, usually falling on the month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (Puri&#x27;s main high street) and travel 3 km to the Shri Gundicha Temple, in huge chariots, allowing the public to have Darshan (i.e., holy view). This festival is known as Ratha Yatra, meaning the festival (&quot;yatra&quot;) of the chariots (&quot;ratha&quot;). The &quot;rathas&quot; are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately high and and takes about 2 months to construct. The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals etc. on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne. The huge chariot of Jagannath pulled during Ratha Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word &quot;juggernaut&quot;. The Ratha Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha Yatra.

The most significant ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra is the &quot;chhera pahara&quot;. During the festival, the Gajapati king wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the &quot;Chera Pahara&quot; (Sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati king cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion. As per the custom, although the Gajapati king has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, still he renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign, the Gajapati king, and the most humble devotee.

&quot;Chera pahara&quot; is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to the garden house at Mausi Maa Temple and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.

As per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the chariots in &quot;Pahandi vijay&quot;, disgruntled devotees hold a right to offer kicks, slaps and make derogatory remarks to the images, and Jagannath behaves like a commoner.

In the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the Gundicha Temple, where they stay for seven days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in &quot;bahuda yatra&quot;. On the way back, the three chariots stop at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered &quot;poda pitha&quot;, a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the poor sections only.

The observance of the Ratha Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in Brahma Purana, Padma Purana and Skanda Purana. Kapila Samhita also refers to Ratha Yatra. During the Moghul period, King Ramsingh of Jaipur, Rajasthan, has also been described as organizing the Ratha Yatra in the 18th century. In Odisha, kings of Mayurbhanj and Parlakhemundi also organized the Ratha Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.

In fact, Starza notes that the ruling Ganga dynasty instituted the Ratha Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. Friar Odoric of Pordenone visited India in 1316–1318, some 20 years after Marco Polo had dictated the account of his travels while in a Genovese prison. In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the &quot;idols&quot; on chariots, and the king and queen and all the people drew them from the &quot;church&quot; with song and music.

==Temples==

&quot;Besides the only temple described below, there are many temples in India, three more in Bangladesh and one in Nepal.&quot;

The Temple of Jagannath at Puri is one of the major Hindu temples in India. The temple is built in the Kalinga style of architecture, with the Pancharatha (Five chariots) type consisting of two anurathas, two konakas and one ratha. Jagannath temple is a pancharatha with well-developed pagas. &#x27;Gajasimhas&#x27; (elephant lions) carved in recesses of the pagas, the &#x27;Jhampasimhas&#x27; (Jumping lions) are also placed properly. The perfect pancharatha temple developed into a Nagara-rekha temple with unique Oriya style of subdivisions like the Pada, Kumbha, Pata, Kani and Vasanta. The Vimana or the apsidal structure consists of several sections superimposed one over other, tapering to the top where the Amalakashila and Kalasa are placed.

Temple of Jagannath at Puri has four distinct sectional structures, namely -
# Deula or Vimana (Sanctum sanctorum) where the triad deities are lodged on the ratnavedi (Throne of Pearls);
# Mukhashala (Frontal porch);
# Nata mandir/Natamandapa, which is also known as the Jaga mohan, (Audience Hall/Dancing Hall), and
# Bhoga Mandapa (Offerings Hall).
The temple is built on an elevated platform, as compared to Lingaraja temple and other temples belonging to this type. This is the first temple in the history of Kalingaan temple architecture where all the chambers like Jagamohana, Bhogamandapa and Natyamandapa were built along with the main temple. There are miniature shrines on the three outer sides of the main temple.

The Deula consists of a tall shikhara (dome) housing the sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha). A pillar made of fossilized wood is used for placing lamps as offering. The Lion Gate (Singhadwara) is the main gate to the temple, guarded by two guardian deities Jaya and Vijaya. A 16-sided, granite monolithic columnar pillar known as the Aruna Stambha (Solar Pillar) bearing Aruna, the charioteer of Surya, faces the Lion Gate. This column was brought here from the Sun temple of Konark.

There is a temple situated in Mahesh, Serampore in West Bengal, which is famous for Rathayatra of Mahesh.

The temple&#x27;s historical records Madala panji maintains that the temple was originally built by King Yayati of the Somavamsi dynasty on the site of the present shrine. However, the historians question the veracity and historicity of the Madala Panji. As per historians, the Deula and the Mukhashala were built in the 12th century by Ganga King Anangabheemadeva, the grandson of Anantavarman Chodaganga and the Natamandapa and Bhogamandapa were constructed subsequently during the reign of Gajapati Purushottama Deva (1462–1491) and Prataprudra Deva (1495–1532) respectively. According to Madala Panji, the outer prakara was built by Gajapati Kapilendradeva (1435–1497). The inner &quot;prakara&quot; called the Kurma bedha (Tortoise encompassment) was built by Purushottama Deva.
