<text>La Santé Prison (named after its location on the Rue de la Santé) ( or ) is a prison operated by the French Prison Service of the Ministry of Justice located in the east of the Montparnasse district of the 14th arrondissement in southern Paris, France, at 42 Rue de la Santé. It is one of the most famous prisons in France, with both VIP and maximum security sections.

La Santé is one of the three main prisons of the Paris area, along with Fleury-Mérogis (Europe&#x27;s largest prison) and Fresnes, both located in the southern suburbs.

==History==
The architect Joseph Auguste Émile Vaudremer built the prison, which was inaugurated on 20 August 1867.

The prison is located on the site of a former coal market and replaced the Madelonnettes Convent in the 3rd Arrondissement, which had been used as a prison since the French Revolution. Previously, on the same site, was a &quot;Maison de la santé&quot; (House of Health), built on the orders of Anne of Austria and transferred in 1651 to what is now the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center.

In 1899, after the closure and demolition of the prison Grande Roquette, convicts were transferred to La Santé either to await transfer to the Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni in French Guiana or to await execution. Initially, there were 500 cells in La Santé, which was increased to 1,000 cells in 1900. The cells are 4 metres long, 2.5m wide and 3m high. The prison has a total capacity of as many as 2,000 prisoners, divided into 14 divisions.

With executions having previously been performed at the entrance to Grande Roquette, it was decided to do something similar at La Santé. The guillotine was erected at the corner of the Rue de la Santé and the Boulevard Arago, on the pavement. The first execution – and the first in Paris for ten years – occurred on 6 August 1909. It was for Georges Duchemin, who had been convicted of parricide.

On 7 May 1932, Eugene Boyer, a 27-year-old criminal who had been denied a presidential pardon the previous day by President Paul Doumer, was to be executed by guillotine. Doumer was assassinated the day the execution was scheduled: in France, the president could reverse his decision until the last moment and obviously Boyer could not benefit from this potential &quot;ultimate mercy&quot;, so the execution was cancelled &quot;in extremis&quot; (twenty minutes before the time scheduled). He was finally pardoned by Albert Lebrun on 13 May – which respected the tradition of pardoning those sentenced to death the first time in the presidential office – and he was sent to prison in Guiana. He was referred to as André Baillard in the book by Henri Charrière.

Nearly forty prisoners ended their lives in this place. It was also at this site that the second-last public execution in France was performed, for burglar and double murderer Max Bloch on 2 June 1939. Fifteen days later on 17 June, Eugen Weidmann, guilty of six murders, was guillotined in front of Versailles prison and on 24 June the decision was made to ban public executions. In the same decision, the death penalty was made dependent on the Court of Appeal of Seine (either Seine-et-Oise or Aube), with prisoners executed inside Prison de la Santé.

On 15 March 1940, the Vocoret brothers, who killed three policemen in Issy-les-Moulineaux, were the first criminals to be guillotined inside the prison.

During the German Occupation of France, in addition to common law criminals, there were also executions of 18 Resistance fighters and communists. Nine of them were guillotined between August 1941 and July 1942. The other nine were shot on 30 April 1944. They are memorialized by a plaque affixed to the wall of the prison at the corner of Rue Jean-Dolent and Rue de la La Santé.

After the Liberation of France, only common criminals were executed in the courtyard of the prison (except for several FLN activists between 1958 and 1960). Those executed included Marcel Petiot in 1946, Marquis Alain de Bernardy de Sigoyer in 1947, Emile Buisson (&quot;Public Enemy No. 1&quot;) in 1956, Jacques Fesch in 1957, and Georges Rapin, known as &quot;Mr. Bill&quot;, in 1960.

The last death sentences by guillotine at La Santé were those of Roger Bontems and Claude Buffet. They were the authors of an escape attempt with hostage-taking that ended with the death of the hostages in 1971. Sentenced to death at Troyes on 29 June 1972, they were executed on the following 28 November.

According to them, those sentenced to death who were from the Île-de-France region were locked in Fresnes Prison (which from 1978 would become the only prison permitted to host executions) but neither were executed due to the eventual abolition of the death penalty. The last two remaining guillotines in France are now stored in the basement of the National Centre for Guidance in Fresnes prison.

In 2000, the chief doctor of the prison, Véronique Vasseur, published a book in which she denounced the very poor imprisonment conditions. The book was a shock to the public and prompted parliamentary evaluation of the situation. In 2014, the prison closed for renovations, which required 5 years to complete 

==Buildings==
The prison features a hub-and-spoke design similar to that which had been implemented previously for the construction of Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US. The prison is surrounded by:

*Boulevard Arago to the north.
*Rue Messier to the west.
*Rue Jean-Dolent to the south.
*Rue de la Santé to the east.

One of the peculiarities of la Santé is that, until 2000, inmates were divided by geographic origin and ethnicity within the prison. One group of prisoners (those who are studying in particular) are grouped separately but most of them were arranged in four blocks:
Block A: Western Europe
Block B: Black Africa
Block C: North Africa
Block D: rest of the world.

These blocks have undergone substantial renovation since 2000. The prison was partially closed from 2014 until 2019 in order to be rehabilitated; the parole section, however, was kept in operation during this time.

Prison de la Santé is now the last &quot;intra-muros&quot; prison in Paris. The other large prisons (in all categories) dependent on Paris are Poissy, Fleury-Mérogis, Fresnes, and Melun.

===The &quot;VIP&quot; Section===
The imprisonment of convicted &quot;personalities&quot; is one of the features of La Santé Prison. The area where these well-known people are imprisoned is termed the &quot;special area&quot; by the administration. The visiting rooms for these prisoners are at 1 rue Messier as for other prisoners (where there is nearby accommodation for visiting relatives).

The movie &quot;Quartier V.I.P.&quot; is set partly there.

==Around the prison==

===&quot;À la bonne Santé&quot;===
In front of the exit of the prison there was a cafe called &quot;À la bonne Santé&quot; (In good health). Relatives of the prisoners would meet there with released prisoners. Scenes from several films took place and were filmed there. The cafe closed in 1980. Currently the premises are used by the prison administration.

===La Santé in popular culture===
*Arsène Lupin, a fictional character by Maurice Leblanc, was taken prisoner at La Santé prison at the end of his debut, the short story &quot;The Arrest of Arsène Lupin,&quot; and in the novel &quot;813&quot; (1910).
*La Santé Prison was the supposed scene of the movie &quot;Le Trou&quot; (The Hole) (1960), directed by Jacques Becker. During preparations for the escape of prisoners through the sewers the street names can be seen on signs in the sewers and there is an exterior view of the prison at the corner of the Boulevard Arago and Rue de la Santé.
*In the song &quot;L&#x27;argent ne fait pas le bonheur&quot; (Money does not buy happiness) (1966) from the group &quot;Les Parisiennes&quot;: &quot;Take all your [clothes] gaily under your arm and leave without paying / We will bring you oranges at La Santé&quot;.
*Georges Brassens evokes La Santé Prison in his song &quot;La femme d&#x27;Hector&quot; (Hector&#x27;s wife): &quot;When one takes us by hand / god darned good in a bag / And one sends us to plant / Cabbages at La Santé&quot; as well as his song &quot;Le mauvais sujet repenti&quot; (The evil-doer repents): &quot;After a century, was thrown / At the door of La Santé&quot;.
*Yves Duteil evokes empathy of a passer-by for the prisoners of La Santé in his song &quot;Le mur de la prison d&#x27;en face&quot; (The prison wall opposite).
* For the episode Broken Wing of U.S. television drama &#x27;Leverage&#x27;, Parker served an unknown amount of time in La Sante. Afterwards, she declared that the best meal she ever ate was in that prison and that she didn&#x27;t serve as long as they thought she would there.
*The novel &quot;A Cold Death&quot; by Michael Mandaville uses La Santé Prison to show the attempted assassination of Maurice Papon.
*In Georges Simenon&#x27;s Maigret series novel &quot;A Man&#x27;s Head&quot;, La Sante Prison features greatly in the first chapter.
*In &quot;Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?&quot;, Lobelia Carlini was detained in La Santé for 1,000-year-long sentence.
*La Sante is the subject of a 2016 episode in the Arte TV Series &quot;Architectures&quot;. In this episode, the design and aesthetic values of the building are studied.

<text>Jack Crawford (22 March 1775 – 10 November 1831) was a sailor of the Royal Navy known as the &quot;Hero of Camperdown.&quot;

==Biography==
Crawford was born in Thornhill&#x27;s Bank (now Pottery Bank) in the East End of Sunderland. He was a keelman until 1786 when, aged 11 or 12, he joined the crew of the &quot;Peggy&quot; at South Shields as an apprentice. He joined the Royal Navy in 1796, possibly as a result of being press-ganged but he may have volunteered, and served on HMS &quot;Venerable&quot; under Admiral Duncan the Royal Navy Commander-in-Chief of the North Seas.

At the Battle of Camperdown off the Dutch coast (11 October 1797), &quot;Venerable&quot; was Admiral Duncan&#x27;s flagship. During the battle, part of the &quot;Venerable&#x27;s&quot; mast was felled, including the admiral&#x27;s flag. Lowering the Admiral&#x27;s personal flag was a sign of surrender, and even an unintentional fall was unacceptable. Despite being under intense gunfire, Crawford climbed the mast and nailed the colours to the top.

After the victory procession in London he was formally presented to the King and was given a government pension of £30 a year, and later a silver medal from the people of Sunderland. However, Crawford fell on hard times and drunkenness, and had to sell his medal. He became the second victim of the cholera epidemic of 1831 and was buried in an unmarked &quot;pauper&#x27;s&quot; grave.

==Legacy==
Towards the end of the nineteenth century interest in the &#x27;Hero of Camperdown&#x27; was renewed, in part through the success of the popular play &quot;Jack Crawford the Hero of Camperdown&quot; by Sunderland-based playwright James Roland MacLaren, which went on tour during the 1880s. This resulted in the erection of a headstone in Holy Trinity, Sunderland churchyard in 1888. Two years later public donations led to a monument being erected in Mowbray Park, opposite what is now Sunderland Civic Centre.

A pub in Monkwearmouth was named the Jack Crawford and sported a carved figure of him on the side of the building. This is referred to in the &quot;North-Country Lore and Legend&quot; magazine for April 1887 (page 91). After the pub was destroyed during World War II, the figure was removed. In 1987 it was loaned to Sunderland Museum and put on display in the local history gallery but has been returned to the owner. The Museum holds Jack Crawford in high regard. There was an exhibition about him on the bicentenary of the Battle of Camperdown and there was a display about him in SeaBritain Year (2005). One of the Learning Rooms is named after him and there are several pieces of nineteenth-century Jack Crawford commemorative pottery on display in the Pottery Gallery. The silver medal that was presented to him by the Town following the battle in 1797, and given to the Museum by the Earl of Camperdown in 1880, is proudly on display in the Sunderland Heroes section of the Museum Street near the entrance of this award-winning Museum.

Doubt has been raised about Crawford&#x27;s heroics. Possible evidence that Crawford was not a volunteer, that he was forced to climb the mast, or that he was drunk is debated. One book, written by the American Sheri Holman, attracted criticism from the city&#x27;s Mayor. However, local historian William Corder had already made the criticism in the 1890s; Corder thought little of Crawford. He claimed that it was reported by reliable witnesses that Crawford was &quot;drunk, acted without orders, and should have been court-martialled&quot;. Furthermore, Corder dismissed as a &quot;deplorable monument&quot; what others called the &quot;fine headstone&quot; of 1888.

A folk song about and entitled &quot;Jack Crawford&quot; – written by Johnny Handle, the Tyneside singer and former member of the High Level Ranters – is frequently on British folk singer, Bob Fox&#x27;s, set list.

<doc id="627400" wikidata="Q2259175" url="?curid=627400" title="Giovanni Zenatello">
<text>Giovanni Zenatello (22 February 1876 – 11 February 1949) was an Italian opera singer. Born in Verona, he enjoyed an international career as a dramatic tenor of the first rank. Otello became his most famous operatic role but his repertoire also included French roles. In 1904, he created the part of Pinkerton in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;.

==Career==

Zenatello showed musical promise from a young age. His singing teacher in Verona originally trained him as a baritone but he never felt comfortable in this range and later switched to the higher tenor register. Nonetheless, it was as a baritone that he made his professional debut at Belluno in 1898. His tenor debut—as Canio—did not come until the following year, in Naples.

Zenatello&#x27;s operatic career gathered momentum during the early years of the 20th century, and on 17 February 1904 he created the role of Pinkerton in the world première of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; at La Scala, Milan. La Scala was Italy&#x27;s leading opera house, and he remained a member of its company of singers until 1907.

He also sang at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, in 1905/06 and 1908/09; at the Manhattan Opera House in 1907 to 1910; and with the New York Metropolitan Opera company, on tour, replacing Enrico Caruso, in 1909. He was a member of the Boston Opera Company from 1909 to 1914 and sang often, too, in South America and Mexico and in various cities of continental Europe.

Zenatello&#x27;s voice had matured into that of a clarion-voiced dramatic tenor during his La Scala years, and he succeeded Francesco Tamagno (1850–1905) as the greatest Italian exponent of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, a role which the Austrian dramatic tenor Leo Slezak sang to equal acclaim. Zenatello performed this extremely taxing role more than 300 times, beginning in 1908, and recorded highly acclaimed excerpts from the work on 78-rpm discs.

Zenatello returned to Covent Garden in 1926, singing Otello in a series of performances which were partly recorded live by HMV. After a final stage appearance (in New York City) in 1933, he retired from opera and taught singing and dabbled in the management of promising young singers. The coloratura soprano Lily Pons was a notable &#x27;discovery&#x27; of Zenatello&#x27;s in the twilight of his on-stage career. He took Pons under his wing and arranged for her an audition before the Met&#x27;s general manager, which resulted in the young French-born singer making a successful New York debut in 1931. Later, however, they fell out.

Another great pupil of his was the Veronese tenor Nino Martini who made his Metropolitan Opera debut in Rigoletto in 1933, which enabled Martini to begin an acclaimed career at the Metropolitan (1933-1946), in other American venues, and in Hollywood as well.
As to his private life, Zenatello lived with the Spanish mezzo-soprano Maria Gay from 1906 until her death in 1943. They were often described as husband and wife although they may never have actually married. He and Gay performed opposite each other on many occasions and settled down together in Manhattan in 1936.

In 1913, Zenatello had been instrumental in having the Verona Arena, built originally by the ancient Romans, restored and turned into a world-famous open-air venue for operatic performances. That same year the arena was used to mount a grand production of &quot;Aida&quot;, marking the centenary of Verdi&#x27;s birth. In 1947, Zenatello arranged for a promising young soprano named Maria Callas and an American tenor and cantor Richard Tucker to appear at the arena&#x27;s Summer Festival in Amilcare Ponchielli&#x27;s opera &quot;La Gioconda&quot;. This appearance would give Callas and Tucker invaluable exposure in Italy and helped set Callas on the path to future international stardom.

Giovanni Zenatello died of natural causes in New York City in 1949, aged 73.

==Recordings==
Zenatello left an important musical legacy in the form of a considerable number of commercial recordings of his voice, made both acoustically and, after 1925, with the aid of microphone technology. His first discs were made in Italy by The Gramophone Company in 1903, followed by a long series for Fonotipia Records. Later, he recorded for the Columbia, Edison and HMV labels. These recordings of operatic arias, duets and ensembles, as well as just one (unpublished) song title (Zenatello was never a song recitalist as was Caruso), have been reissued on CD in recent years, most notably by the English firms Pearl and Symposium Records and on the Austrian Preiser label. They reflect the wide range of his repertoire and the best of them confirm the impressive power, thrust and ardency of his singing as well as often suspect intonation. Zenatello left recorded memoirs from the roles he created (including arias and duets from &quot;Siberia&quot;, &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, and &quot;La Figlia di Jorio&quot;).

A radio interview with an elderly Zenatello, recorded in 1947, includes a creditable (if transposed downwards, due to the singer&#x27;s age) piano accompanied performance of the closing scene &quot;Niun mi tema&quot; from &quot;Otello&quot;. This interview was reissued in the 1960s and can be heard on CD.

<doc id="627405" wikidata="Q2390458" url="?curid=627405" title="Telephone numbering plan">
<text>A telephone numbering plan is a type of numbering scheme used in telecommunication to assign telephone numbers to subscriber telephones or other telephony endpoints. Telephone numbers are the addresses of participants in a telephone network, reachable by a system of destination code routing. Telephone numbering plans are defined in each of the administrative regions of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and in private telephone networks.

For public numbering systems, geographic location typically plays a role in the sequence of numbers assigned to each telephone subscriber. Many numbering plan administrators subdivide their territory of service into geographic regions designated by a prefix, often called an area code or city code, which is a set of digits forming the most-significant part of the dialing sequence to reach a telephone subscriber.

Numbering plans may follow a variety of design strategies which have often arisen from the historical evolution of individual telephone networks and local requirements. A broad division is commonly recognized between closed and open numbering plans. A closed numbering plan, as found in North America, features fixed-length area codes and local numbers, while an open numbering plan has a variance in the length of the area code, local number, or both of a telephone number assigned to a subscriber line. The latter type developed predominantly in Europe.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has established a comprehensive numbering plan, designated E.164, for uniform interoperability of the networks of its member state or regional administrations. It is an open numbering plan but imposes a maximum length of 15 digits to telephone numbers. The standard defines a country code for each member region which is prefixed to each national telephone number for international destination routing.

Private numbering plans exist in telephone networks that are privately operated in an enterprise or organizational campus. Such systems may be supported by a private branch exchange (PBX), which provides a central access point to the PSTN and also controls internal calls between telephone extensions.

In contrast to numbering plans, which determine telephone numbers assigned to subscriber stations, dialing plans establish the customer dialing procedures, i.e., the sequence of digits or symbols to be dialed to reach a destination. It is the manner in which the numbering plan is used. Even in closed numbering plans, it is not always necessary to dial all digits of a number. For example, an area code may often be omitted when the destination is in the same area as the calling station.

==Telephone number structure==
National or regional telecommunication administrations that are members of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) use national telephone numbering plans that conform to international standard E.164.

E.164 specifies that a telephone number consist of a country code and a national telephone number. National telephone numbers are defined by national or regional numbering plans, such as the European Telephony Numbering Space, the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), or the UK number plan.

Within a national numbering plan, a complete destination telephone number is typically composed of an area code and a subscriber telephone number.

Many national numbering plans have developed from local historical requirements and progress or technological advancements, which resulted in a variety of structural characteristics of the telephone numbers assigned to telephones. In the United States, the industry decided in 1947 to unite all local telephone networks under one common numbering plan with a fixed length of ten digits for the national telephone number of each telephone, of which the last seven digits were known as the local &quot;directory number&quot;, or &quot;subscriber number&quot;. Such a numbering plan became known as a closed numbering plan. In several European countries, a different strategy prevailed, known as the open numbering plan, which features a variance in the length of the area code, the local number, or both.

===Subscriber number===
The subscriber number is the address assigned to a telephone line or wireless communication channel terminating at the customer equipment. The first few digits of the subscriber number may indicate smaller geographical scopes, such as towns or districts, based on municipal aspects, or individual telephone exchanges (&quot;central office code&quot;), such as a wire centers. In mobile networks they may indicate the network provider. Callers in a given area sometimes do not need to include area prefixes when dialing within the same area, but devices that dial telephone numbers automatically may include the full number with area and access codes.

The subscriber number is typically listed in local telephone directories, and is therefore often referred to as the &quot;directory number&quot;.

===Area code===

Telephone administrations that manage telecommunication infrastructure of extended size, such as a large country, often divide the territory into geographic areas. This benefits independent management by administrative or historical subdivisions, such as states and provinces, of the territory or country. Each area of subdivision is identified in the numbering plan with a routing code. This concept was first developed in the planning for a &quot;nationwide numbering plan&quot; for Operator Toll Dialing and direct distance dialing (DDD) in the Bell System in the United States in the 1940s, a system that resulted in the North American Numbering Plan for World Zone 1. AT&amp;T divided the United States and Canada into numbering plan areas (NPAs), and assigned to each NPA a unique three-digit prefix, the &quot;numbering plan area code&quot;, which became known in short-form as &quot;NPA code&quot; or simply area code. The area code is prefixed to each telephone number issued in its service area.

Other national telecommunication authorities use various formats and dialing rules for area codes. The size of area code prefixes may either be fixed or variable. Area codes in the NANP have three digits, while two digits are used in Brazil, one digit in Australia and New Zealand. Variable-length formats exist in multiple countries including: Argentina, Austria (1 to 4), Germany (2 to 5 digits), Japan (1 to 5), Mexico (2 or 3 digits), Peru (1 or 2), Syria (1 or 2) and the United Kingdom. In addition to digit count, the format may be restricted to certain digit patterns. For example, the NANP had at times specific restrictions on the range of digits for the three positions, and required assignment to geographical areas avoiding nearby areas receiving similar area codes to avoid confusion and misdialing.

Some countries, such as Denmark and Uruguay, have merged variable-length area codes and telephone numbers into fixed-length numbers that must always be dialed independently of location. In such administrations, the area code is not distinguished formally in the telephone number.

In the UK, area codes were first known as subscriber trunk dialling (STD) codes. Depending on local dialing plans, they are often necessary only when dialed from outside the code area or from mobile phones. In North America ten-digit dialing is required in areas with overlay numbering plans, in which multiple area codes are assigned to the same area.

The strict correlation of a telephone number to a geographical area has been broken by technical advances, such as local number portability in the North American Numbering Plan and voice over IP services.

When dialing a telephone number, the area code may have to be preceded by a trunk prefix or national access code for domestic calls, and for international calls by the international access code and country code.

Area codes are often quoted by including the national access code. For example, a number in London may be listed as &quot;020 7946 0321&quot;. Users must correctly interpret &quot;020&quot; as the code for London. If they call from another station within London, they may merely dial &quot;7946 0321&quot;, or if dialing from another country, the initial &quot;0&quot; should be omitted after the country code.

==International numbering plan==
The E.164 standard of the International Telecommunication Union is an international numbering plan and establishes a country calling code (&quot;country code&quot;) for each member organization. Country codes are prefixes to national telephone numbers that denote call routing to the network of a subordinate number plan administration, typically a country, or group of countries with a uniform numbering plan, such as the NANP. E.164 permits a maximum length of 15 digits for the complete international phone number consisting of the country code, the national routing code (area code), and the subscriber number. E.164 does not define regional numbering plans, however, it does provide recommendations for new implementations and uniform representation of all telephone numbers.

===Country code===
Country codes are necessary only when dialing telephone numbers in other countries than the originating telephone, but many networks permit them for all calls. These are dialed before the national telephone number.

Following ITU-T specification E.123, international telephone numbers are commonly indicated in listings by prefixing the country code with a plus sign (). This reminds the subscriber to dial the international access code of the country from which the call is placed. For example, the international dialing prefix or &quot;access code&quot; in all NANP countries is &quot;011&quot;, and &quot;00&quot; in most other countries. On modern mobile telephones and many voice over IP services, the plus sign can usually be dialed and functions directly as the international access code. Peer-to-peer SIP uses Dynamic Delegation Discovery System to perform endpoint discovery, and therefore E.164 numbers.

===Special services===
Within the system of country calling codes, the ITU has defined certain prefixes for special services, and assigns such codes for independent international networks, such as satellite systems, spanning beyond the scope of regional authorities.

Some special service codes are the following:
* 388 5 – shared code for groups of nations
* 388 3 – European Telephony Numbering Space – Europe-wide services (discontinued)
* 800 – International Freephone (UIFN)
* 808 – reserved for Shared Cost Services
* 878 – Universal Personal Telecommunications services
* 881 – Global Mobile Satellite System
* 882 and +883 – International Networks
* 888 - international disaster relief operations
* 979 – International Premium Rate Service
* 991 – International Telecommunications Public Correspondence Service trial (ITPCS)
* 999 – reserved for future global service

===Satellite telephone systems===
Satellite phones are typically issued with telephone numbers with a special country calling code, for example:
* Inmarsat: 870: SNAC (Single Network Access Code)
* ICO Global: 881 0, 881 1
* Ellipso: 881 2, 881 3
* Iridium: 881 6, 881 7
* Globalstar: 881 8, 881 9
* Emsat: 882 13
* Thuraya: 882 16
* ACeS: 882 20
Some satellite telephones are issued with telephone numbers from a national numbering plan; for example, Globalstar issues NANP telephone numbers.

==Private numbering plan==
Like a public telecommunications network, a private telephone network in an enterprise or within an organizational campus may implement a &quot;private&quot; numbering plan for the installed base of telephones for internal communication. Such networks operate a private switching system or a private branch exchange (PBX) within the network. The internal numbers assigned are often called &quot;extension numbers&quot;, as the internal numbering plan extends an official, published main access number for the entire network. A caller from within the network only dials the extension number assigned to another internal destination telephone.

A private numbering plan provides the convenience of mapping station telephone numbers to other commonly used numbering schemes in an enterprise. For example, station numbers may be assigned as the room number of a hotel or hospital. Station numbers may also be strategically mapped to certain keywords composed from the letters on the telephone dial, such as 4357 (&quot;help&quot;) to reach a help desk.

The internal number assignments may be independent of any direct inward dialing (DID) services provided by external telecommunication vendors. For numbers without DID access, the internal switch relays externally originated calls via an operator, an automated attendant or an electronic interactive voice response system. Telephone numbers for users within such systems are often published by suffixing the official telephone number with the extension number, e.g., 1 800 555-0001 x2055.

Some systems may automatically map a large block of DID numbers (differing only in a trailing sequence of digits) to a corresponding block of individual internal stations, allowing each of them to be reached directly from the public switched telephone network. In some of these cases, a special shorter dial-in number can be used to reach an operator who can be asked for general information, e.g. help looking up or connecting to internal numbers. For example, individual extensions at Universität des Saarlandes can be dialed directly from outside via their four-digit internal extension +49-681-302-xxxx, whereas the university&#x27;s official main number is +49-681-302-0 (49 is the country code for Germany, 681 is the area code for Saarbrücken, 302 the prefix for the university).

Callers within a private numbering plan often dial a trunk prefix to reach a national or international destination (&quot;outside line&quot;) or to access a leased line (or &quot;tie-line&quot;) to another location within the same enterprise. A large manufacturer with factories and offices in multiple cities may use a prefix (such as &#x27;8&#x27;) followed by an internal routing code to indicate a city or location, then an individual four- or five-digit extension number at the destination site. A common trunk prefix for an outside line on North American systems is the digit 9, followed by the outside destination number.

Additional dial plan customisations, such as single-digit access to a hotel front desk or room service from an individual room, are available at the sole discretion of the PBX owner.

==Numbering plan indicator==
Signaling in telecommunication networks is specific to the technology in use for each link. During signaling, it is common that additional information is passed between switching systems that is not represented in telephone numbers, which serve only as network addresses of endpoints. One such information element is the numbering plan indicator (NPI). It is a number defined in the ITU standard Q.713, paragraph 3.4.2.3.3, indicating the numbering plan of the attached telephone number. NPIs can be found in Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) and short message service (SMS) messages. , the following numbering plans and their respective numbering plan indicator values have been defined:

==Subscriber dialing procedures==
While a telephone numbering plan specifies the digit sequence assigned to each telephone or wire line, establishing the network addresses needed for routing calls, numbering plan administrators may define certain dialing procedures for placing calls. This may include the dialing of additional prefixes necessary for administrative or technical reasons, or it may permit short code sequences for convenience or speed of service, such as in cases of emergency. The body of dialing procedures of a numbering plan administration is often called a dial plan.

A dial plan establishes the expected sequence of digits dialed on subscriber premises equipment, such as telephones, in private branch exchange (PBX) systems, or in other telephone switches to effect access to the telephone networks for the routing of telephone calls, or to effect or activate specific service features by the local telephone company, such as 311 or 411 service.

===Variable-length dialing===
Within the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), the administration defines standard and permissive dialing procedures, specifying the number of mandatory digits to be dialed for local calls within a single numbering plan area (NPA), as well as alternate, optional sequences, such as adding the prefix 1 before the telephone number.

Despite the closed numbering plan in the NANP, different dialing procedures exist in many of the territories for local and long-distance telephone calls. This means that to call another number within the same city or area, callers need to dial only a subset of the full telephone number. For example, in the NANP, only the seven-digit number may need to be dialed, but for calls outside the local numbering plan area, the full number including the area code is required. In these situations, ITU-T Recommendation E.123 suggests to list the area code in parentheses, signifying that in some cases the area code is optional or may not be required.

Internationally, an area code is typically prefixed by a domestic trunk access code (usually 0) when dialing from inside a country, but is not necessary when calling from other countries; there are exceptions, such as for Italian land lines.

To call a number in Sydney, Australia, for example:
* xxxx xxxx (within Sydney and other locations within New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory - no area code required)
* (02) xxxx xxxx (outside New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, but still within Australia - the area code is required)
* +61 2 xxxx xxxx (outside Australia)

The plus character (+) in the markup signifies that the following digits are the country code, in this case 61. Some phones, especially mobile telephones, allow the + to be entered directly. For other devices the user must replace the + with the international access code for their current location. In the United States, most carriers require the caller to dial 011 before the destination country code.

New Zealand requires the area code to be dialed when calling between two local calling areas. During the 1970s and 1980s, each local calling area had its own area code. For example, Christchurch and Nelson in the late 1980s:

* (03) xxx xxx — to call Christchurch from Nelson.
* (054) xx xxx — to call Nelson from Christchurch.

During the early 1990s, the numbering plan was reorganised with the numerous area codes merged into just five, but the requirement to dial the area code between local calling areas remained. This means even though Christchurch and Nelson are now both in the same area code, the area code has to be dialed for calls between the two cities.

* (03) 3xx xxxx — to call Christchurch from Nelson.
* (03) 54x xxxx — to call Nelson from Christchurch.

In many areas of the NANP, the domestic trunk code (long-distance access code) must also be dialed along with the area code for long-distance calls even within the same numbering plan area. For example, to call a number in Regina in area code 306:
* 306 xxx xxxx — within Regina, Lumsden and other local areas
* 1 306 xxx xxxx — within Saskatchewan, but not within the Regina local calling area, e.g., Saskatoon
* 1 306 xxx xxxx — anywhere within the NANP outside Saskatchewan

In many parts of North America, especially in area code overlay complexes, dialing the area code, or 1 and the area code, is required even for local calls. Dialing from mobile phones does not require the trunk code in the US, although it is still necessary for calling all long-distance numbers from a mobile phone in Canada. Many mobile handsets automatically add the area code of the set&#x27;s telephone number for outbound calls, if not dialed by the user.

In some parts of the United States, especially northeastern states such as Pennsylvania served by Verizon Communications, the ten-digit number must be dialed. If the call is not local, the call fails unless the dialed number is preceded by digit 1. Thus:
* 610 xxx xxxx — local calls within the 610 area code and its overlay (484), as well as calls to or from the neighboring 215 area code and its overlay, 267. Area code is required; one of two completion options for mobile phones within the U.S.
* 1 610 xxx xxxx — calls from numbers outside the 610/484 and 215/267 area codes; second of two completion options for mobile phones within the U.S.

In California and New York, because of the existence of both overlay area codes (where an area code must be dialed for every call) and non-overlay area codes (where an area code is dialed only for calls outside the subscriber&#x27;s home area code), &quot;permissive home area code dialing&quot; of 1 + the area code within the same area code, even if no area code is required, has been permitted since the mid-2000s. For example, in the 559 area code (a non-overlay area code), calls may be dialed as seven digits (XXX-XXXX) or 1 559 + 7 digits. The manner in which a call is dialed does not affect the billing of the call. This &quot;permissive home area code dialing&quot; helps maintain uniformity and eliminates confusion given the different types of area code relief that has made California the nation&#x27;s most &quot;area code&quot; intensive State. Unlike other states with overlay area codes (Texas, Maryland, Florida and Pennsylvania and others), the California Public Utilities Commission and the New York State Public Service Commission maintain two different dial plans: Landlines must dial 1 + area code whenever an Area Code is part of the dialed digits while cellphone users can omit the &quot;1&quot; and just dial 10 digits.

Many organizations have private branch exchange systems which permit dialing the access digit(s) for an outside line (usually 9 or 8), a &quot;1&quot; and finally the local area code and &quot;xxx xxxx&quot; in areas without overlays. This aspect is unintentionally helpful for employees who reside in one area code and work in an area code with one, two, or three adjacent area codes. 1+ dialing to any area code by an employee can be done quickly, with all exceptions processed by the private branch exchange and passed onto the public switched telephone network.

===Full-number dialing===
In small countries or areas, the full telephone number is used for all calls, even in the same area. This has traditionally been the case in small countries and territories where area codes have not been required. However, there has been a trend in many countries towards making all numbers a standard length, and incorporating the area code into the subscriber&#x27;s number. This usually makes the use of a trunk code obsolete.
For example, to call someone in Oslo in Norway before 1992, it was necessary to dial:
* xxx xxx (within Oslo - no area code required)
* (02) xxx xxx (within Norway - outside Oslo)
* 47 2 xxx xxx (outside Norway)

After 1992, this changed to a closed eight-digit numbering plan, e.g.:
* 22xx xxxx (within Norway - including Oslo)
* 47 22xx xxxx (outside Norway)

However, in other countries, such as France, Belgium, Japan, Switzerland, South Africa and some parts of North America, the trunk code is retained for domestic calls, whether local or national, e.g.,

* Paris 01 xx xx xx xx (outside France +33 1 xxxx xxxx)
* Brussels 02 xxx xxxx (outside Belgium +32 2 xxx xxxx)
* Geneva 022 xxx xxxx (outside Switzerland +41 22 xxx xxxx)
* Cape Town 021 xxx xxxx (outside South Africa +27 21 xxx xxxx)
* New York 1 212 xxx xxxx (outside the North American Numbering Plan +1 212 xxx xxxx)
* Fukuoka 092 xxx xxxx (outside the Japanese Numbering Plan +81 92 xxx xxxx)
* India &quot;0-10 Digit Number&quot; (outside India +91 XXXXXXXXXX). In India due to the availability of multiple operators, the metro cities have short codes which range from 2 to 8 digits. 

While some, like Italy, require the initial zero to be dialed, even for calls from outside the country, e.g.,

* Rome 06 xxxxxxxx (outside Italy +39 06 xxxxxxxx)

While dialing of full national numbers takes longer than a local number without the area code, the increased use of phones that can store numbers means that this is of decreasing importance. It also makes it easier to display numbers in the international format, as no trunk code is required—hence a number in Prague, Czech Republic, can now be displayed as:

* 2xx xxx xxx (inside Czech Republic)
* +420 2xx xxx xxx (outside Czech Republic)

as opposed to before September 21, 2002:

* 02 / xx xx xx xx (inside Czech Republic)
* +420 2 / xx xx xx xx (outside Czech Republic)

Some countries already switched, but trunk prefix re-added with the closed dialing plan, for example in Bangkok, Thailand before 1997:
* xxx-xxxx (inside Bangkok)
* 02-xxx-xxxx (inside Thailand)
* +66 2-xxx-xxxx (outside Thailand)

This was changed in 1997:
* 2-xxx-xxxx (inside Thailand)
* +66 2-xxx-xxxx (outside Thailand)

Trunk prefix was re-added in 2001
* 02-xxx-xxxx (inside Thailand)
* +66 2-xxx-xxxx (outside Thailand)

<text>The New Labour Party (NLP) was a minor South African political party founded by Peter Marais through floor crossing legislation after he left the New National Party under some disrepute. The name was chosen to evoke the former Labour Party led by the Reverend Allan Hendrickse, as an anti-apartheid Coloured party. The NLP sought to position itself as the political voice of Coloured people, particularly in the Western Cape Province, but it was unsuccessful. The party won only 0.09% of the vote in the 2004 nationwide election and 0.67% in the simultaneous election to the Western Cape legislature.

It did not contest the 2009 election, but supporting the formation of a new party, the Christian Democratic Alliance (CDA), along with several other parties. The CDA failed to win a seat.

<text>Petrus Jacobus &quot;Peter&quot; Marais (born 4 September 1948) is a retired South African politician who served as a Member of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament.

He previously served as the inaugural Mayor of Cape Town from 2000 until his dismissal in 2001. He was soon appointed Premier of the Western Cape and served from 2001 to 2002. He has been a member of multiple political parties and movements.

Marais joined the Freedom Front Plus in January 2019 and consequently became the party&#x27;s Western Cape Premier candidate for the 2019 election. He returned to the Western Cape Provincial Parliament in May 2019.

==Political career==
Marais was the leader of the People&#x27;s Congress Party and represented the party in the House of Representatives from 1984 to 1994. He joined the National Party in 1994, and was elected to the Western Cape Provincial Parliament later in the same year. In 1998, the newly-elected Premier of the Western Cape, Gerald Morkel, appointed Marais to the post of Provincial Minister of Health and Welfare. Morkel later dismissed him as Provincial Minister in February 2000 but re-appointed him to the Provincial Cabinet in June, heading the Social Services and Poverty Relief portfolio.

Marais was a senior member of the New National Party. He became a member of the newly formed Democratic Alliance in June 2000 and consequently held dual party membership. He was the Democratic Alliance&#x27;s Cape Town mayoral candidate for the December local government elections. The DA won a majority of seats on the newly established Cape Town City Council and Marais was elected Mayor of Cape Town in December 2000. Due to his unhappiness with Marais, the Leader of Democratic Alliance, Tony Leon, dismissed Marais as mayor in 2001. Marais subsequently appealed to The Western Cape High Court and the court ordered his reinstatement in November 2001. He resigned as Mayor of Cape Town hours after the court delivered its judgement. The sacking of Marais contributed to the New National Party pulling out of the Democratic Alliance.

Marais was elected Premier of the Western Cape on 5 December 2001 and served until his resignation on 3 June 2002 amid allegations of sexual harassment. The Western Cape High Court later found him not guilty of the charges.

Following his departure from the New National Party, Marais founded the New Labour Party. The party performed poorly in the 2004 elections and as a result, was dissolved.

Marais joined the newly-formed Congress of the People in November 2008 but quit the party in 2009. He alongside Danny Titus established the Brown Empowerment Movement (Afrikaans: Bruin Bemagtiging Beweging) in June 2013. Marais joined the Independent Civic Organisation of South Africa in July 2018.

In January 2019, Leader of the Freedom Front Plus, Pieter Groenewald, announced Marais as the party&#x27;s Western Cape Premier candidate for the general election on 8 May. At the elections, the Freedom Front Plus won one seat in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. Marais filled the seat on 22 May 2019.

Marais retired from politics at the 2024 provincial election. His son, Grant, succeeded him as the sole representative of the FF Plus in the Provincial Parliament.
==Family and personal life==
Marais was born in Cape Town. He attended Kensington High School and later studied at the University of the Western Cape.

He is married to Bonita Marais and the couple have children.

<text>A jewel bearing is a plain bearing in which a metal spindle turns in a jewel-lined pivot hole. The hole is typically shaped like a torus and is slightly larger than the shaft diameter. The jewels are typically made from the mineral corundum, usually either synthetic sapphire or synthetic ruby. Jewel bearings are used in precision instruments where low friction, long life, and dimensional accuracy are important. Their main use is in mechanical watches.

==History==
Jewel bearings were invented in 1704 for use in watches by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, Peter Debaufre, and Jacob Debaufre, who received an English patent for the idea. Originally natural jewels were used, such as diamond, sapphire, ruby, and garnet. In 1902, a process to make synthetic sapphire and ruby (crystalline aluminium oxide, also known as corundum) was invented by Auguste Verneuil, making jewelled bearings much cheaper. Today most jewelled bearings are synthetic ruby or sapphire.

Historically, jewel pivots were made by grinding using diamond abrasive. Modern jewel pivots are often made using high-powered lasers, chemical etching, and ultrasonic milling.

During World War II jewel bearings were one of the products restricted by the United States government War Production Board as critical to the war effort.

==Characteristics==
The advantages of jewel bearings include high accuracy, very small size and weight, low and predictable friction, good temperature stability, and the ability to operate without lubrication and in corrosive environments. They are known for their low kinetic friction and highly consistent static friction. The static coefficient of friction of brass-on-steel is 0.35, while that of sapphire-on-steel is 0.10–0.15. Sapphire surfaces are very hard and durable, with Mohs hardness of 9 and Knoop hardness of 1800, and can maintain smoothness over decades of use, thus reducing friction variability. Disadvantages include brittleness and fragility, limited availability and applicability in medium and large bearing sizes and capacities, and friction variations if the load is not axial. Like other bearings, most jeweled pivots use oil lubrication to reduce friction.

==Uses==
The predominant use of jewel bearings is in mechanical watches, where their low and predictable friction improves watch accuracy as well as improving bearing life. Manufacturers traditionally listed the number of jewels prominently on the watch face or back, as an advertising point. A typical &quot;fully jeweled&quot; time-only watch has 17 jewels: two cap jewels, two pivot jewels and an impulse jewel for the balance wheel, two pivot jewels and two pallet jewels for the pallet fork, and two pivot jewels each for the escape, fourth, third, and center wheels. 
In modern quartz watches, the timekeeper is a quartz crystal in an electronic circuit, powering a small stepper motor. Because of the small amount of torque needed to move the hands, there is almost no pressure on the bearings and no real gain by using a jewel bearing, hence they are not used in a large proportion of quartz movements. 

The other major use of jeweled bearings is in sensitive mechanical measuring instruments. They are typically used for delicate linkages that must carry very small forces, in instruments such as galvanometers, compasses, gyroscopes, gimbals, dial indicators, dial calipers, and turbine flow meters. In such instruments, jewel bearings are often used as pivots for their needles which need to move reliably and with low variability even when measuring small changes. Bearing bores are typically smaller than 1 mm and support loads weighing less than 1 gram, although they are made as large as 10 mm and may support loads up to about 500 g. Their use has diminished with the popularization of digital measuring instruments.

<doc id="627414" wikidata="Q835054" url="?curid=627414" title="Shine On (Pink Floyd box set)">
<text>Shine On is a nine-CD box set by English rock band Pink Floyd, released in 1992 through EMI Records in the UK and Columbia Records in the US, to coincide with Pink Floyd&#x27;s 25th anniversary as a recording and touring band. All CDs were digitally remastered.

== Content ==
The eight albums included in this box set are:
*&quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;
*&quot;Meddle&quot;
*&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;
*&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;
*&quot;Animals&quot;
*&quot;The Wall&quot;
*&quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;
*&quot;The Early Singles&quot; (bonus CD, unavailable elsewhere)
The packaging on each of the previously released albums was unique to this set, with each CD housed in a solid black jewel case with a small sticker of the album cover affixed to the front. When lined up in order of release, the spines of the eight CD cases displayed the prism image from the cover of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

Included with the box set was a hardcover book chronicling the career of Pink Floyd, from its inception to the late 1980s, and an envelope of postcards depicting artwork from the included seven albums and the cover of the box set itself.

As the collection was meant to showcase the best of Pink Floyd, the decision was made to not include the soundtrack albums &quot;More&quot; or &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot;, or the albums &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut&quot;. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, was also omitted, as EMI were planning to release a special edition of the album at the time, and it was hoped that new fans would buy both this set and the re-released debut album.

David Gilmour said the title of the &quot;Shine On&quot; box set (taken from the &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; track &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;) was not meant to indicate retirement on the band&#x27;s part but rather a continuation of the band&#x27;s progress. According to drummer Nick Mason, an initial suggestion for the title of the set was &quot;The Big Bong Theory&quot;.

===&quot;The Early Singles&quot;===
&quot;Shine On&quot; contained a bonus CD which compiled, for the first time ever, the band&#x27;s first five 7&quot; single A- and B-sides, in their original mono mixes. Some promotional copies of the disc were also issued separately to radio stations. Unlike the other discs in the box set, &quot;The Early Singles&quot; was housed in a digipak case.

<doc id="627415" wikidata="Q1754592" url="?curid=627415" title="Nerdcore">
<text>Nerdcore is a genre of hip hop music characterized by subject matter considered of interest to nerds and geeks. Self-described nerdcore musician MC Frontalot has the earliest known recorded use of the term (to describe this genre) in the 2000 song &quot;Nerdcore Hiphop&quot;. Frontalot, like most nerdcore artists, self-publishes his work and has released much of it for free online. As a niche genre, nerdcore generally holds to the DIY ethic, and has a history of self-publishing and self-production.

Though nerdcore rappers rhyme about anything from politics to science fiction, there are some perennial favorites in nerdcore subject matter, including anime, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, role-playing games, science, fantasy and computers.

==Sound==

Being more defined by lyrics, nerdcore has no unifying musical sound, and the sound of nerdcore varies wildly from artist to artist. One common theme, especially in the early days of the genre, is uncleared sampling. MC Frontalot addressed this directly in his 1999 song &quot;Good Old Clyde&quot;, a thank you of sorts to Clyde Stubblefield for the &quot;funky drummer&quot; break – which was sampled to provide the song&#x27;s beat. Sources for samples in nerdcore range from Vanilla Ice to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (&quot;Rondo Alla Turca&quot;, in MC Plus+&#x27;s &quot;Computer Science for Life&quot;). YTCracker&#x27;s &quot;Nerdrap Entertainment System&quot; is an entire album made up primarily of samples from 8-bit Nintendo games. Another notable artist, Random, created an album dedicated to the Mega Man video games in 2007 titled &quot;MegaRan&quot;. Though some artists have moved away from this—Frontalot, for example, completely remixed several songs to remove uncleared samples before releasing them commercially on his 2005 album &quot;Nerdcore Rising&quot;—it is still quite common, as most nerdcore tracks are released non-commercially and thus attract little to no attention from the RIAA.

Several DJs have provided beats and done remixes for multiple nerdcore artists, most notably Baddd Spellah, who currently mixes the majority of Frontalot&#x27;s tracks. Spellah also won a remix competition in 2004.

==History==

The term &quot;nerdcore hip hop&quot; was first recorded in 2000 by MC Frontalot. However, long before its formal naming, artists like the Beastie Boys, Kool Keith, Deltron 3030, MC 900 Ft. Jesus, MC Paul Barman, Company Flow, and MF Doom explored unconventional hip-hop topics, including science fiction and space. While these artists were not directly part of the nerdcore movement, their work influenced its development. For example, the Beastie Boys’ sci-fi-themed 1998 album &quot;Hello Nasty&quot; featured tracks like &quot;Intergalactic&quot; and &quot;Unite,&quot; which predated the popularization of nerdcore. Similarly, Blackalicious created science-oriented compositions like &quot;Chemical Calisthenics,&quot; and MF DOOM drew heavy inspiration from comic book supervillains. Despite these thematic overlaps, they are generally seen as part of conventional hip hop rather than nerdcore, largely because they did not self-identify as nerdcore artists.

Conversely, nerdcore artists do not always concentrate solely on stereotypically &quot;nerdy&quot; topics. For instance, MC Frontalot&#x27;s songs often explore broader themes. The key distinction between nerdcore and other genres lies in self-identification: while groups like Blackalicious do not label themselves as &quot;nerds,&quot; Frontalot and other nerdcore artists embrace that identity.
Nerdcore was influenced by other &quot;geek&quot; genres, such as filk and geek rock. Artists like They Might Be Giants and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic (with tracks like &quot;I Can&#x27;t Watch This,&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Pentiums,&quot; &quot;White &amp; Nerdy,&quot; and &quot;Foil&quot;) helped lay the groundwork for nerdcore’s rise by combining humor, fandom, and niche cultural references.

The genre gained significant traction in 2004 when the webcomic Penny Arcade held its first convention, the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX), in Bellevue, Washington. Alongside gaming-focused content, geek-friendly musicians, including MC Frontalot and Optimus Rhyme, performed at the event. The following year’s expo featured full concerts with nerdy hip-hop acts, further solidifying the &quot;nerdcore&quot; label and growing its fan base. Many fans eventually became artists themselves, expanding the genre.

In 2005, a subgenre called geeksta rap emerged, drawing inspiration from gangsta rap but focusing on technical expertise and skills, such as computer programming. This braggadocious style led to nerdcore&#x27;s first major feud, between MC Plus+ and Monzy.
In 2006, Jason Z. Christie (aka High-C) launched the first websites dedicated solely to nerdcore, NerdcoreHipHop.org and RhymeTorrents.com. These platforms became hubs for the community and distributed the &quot;Rhyme Torrents Compilation,&quot; the first nerdcore-focused CD series. This brought mainstream media attention to the genre, including coverage in &quot;Wired&quot;.

MC Lars also contributed to nerdcore’s rise in 2006 with his single &quot;Download This Song,&quot; which criticized the music industry’s stance on digital downloads. The track charted at #29 on the ARIA Chart and highlighted the genre’s strong ties to digital culture.

From 2008 to 2013, Orlando, Florida hosted Nerdapalooza, an annual charity festival bringing together nerdcore acts and other &quot;nerd music&quot; genres. In 2009, Amsterdam hosted &quot;Glitched: The Dutch Nerdcore Event,&quot; featuring European premieres and performances by MC Lars, YTCracker, Beefy, and MC Router.

By the late 2010s and early 2020s, Nerdcore expanded on platforms like YouTube, giving rise to subgenres like Otacore (focused on anime-themed rap) and Hackcore, which explores hacking and tech culture.

==Film==

Two feature-length documentaries about the world of nerdcore were released in early 2008: &quot;Nerdcore Rising&quot; and &quot;Nerdcore For Life&quot;. While both films aimed to document the rise of nerdcore, they faced criticism for not fully addressing the genre&#x27;s complexity and controversies. &quot;Nerdcore Rising&quot; premiered at the SXSW Film Conference and Festival on March 9, 2008, while &quot;Nerdcore For Life&quot; debuted at the tenth annual Wisconsin Film Festival on April 5, 2008.

&quot;Nerdcore Rising,&quot; directed by New York filmmakers Negin Farsad and Kimmy Gatewood, focuses on nerdcore pioneer MC Frontalot and his first US tour in 2006. The film was noted for centering primarily on Frontalot’s journey, leaving broader aspects of the genre underexplored.

&quot;Nerdcore For Life,&quot; directed by Chicago filmmaker Dan Lamoureux, examines the genre through appearances by over three dozen notable performers. Critics pointed to challenges in capturing the genre’s diverse perspectives and addressing key cultural issues within the nerdcore 

== Controversies ==
Nerdcore, as a genre, has faced intense and polarizing controversies, with its connection to hip hop&#x27;s cultural foundations sparking fierce debate. Central to the conflict is the accusation that nerdcore distances itself from hip-hop&#x27;s sociocultural roots, which are inextricably tied to African-American culture. Critics have argued that the genre, historically dominated by white artists, risks veering into cultural appropriation, effectively erasing the contributions and struggles of Black communities that birthed hip-hop. These tensions boiled over in 2010, igniting widespread online discourse as heated arguments erupted over nerdcore&#x27;s racial dynamics. Accusations of &quot;whitewashing&quot; hip-hop&#x27;s heritage became a flashpoint, with critics questioning whether the genre&#x27;s rise among predominantly white audiences signaled an intentional or unconscious erasure of Black culture. The debate cast a harsh spotlight on the ethical responsibilities of nerdcore artists and fans, forcing the community to reckon with the consequences of its identity and impact.

Another layer of controversy within the nerdcore community centers on the personal behavior of some of its stars. Notably, mc chris faced backlash in 2012 when he had a fan ejected from a show over a critical tweet. The incident was widely condemned and led to a significant decline in his popularity, influencing his decision to retire from touring.

Additionally, in 2016, Alex Trebek faced backlash after calling the creators of a contestant&#x27;s favorite music genre, nerdcore hip-hop, &quot;losers&quot; during a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; episode. The contestant, Susan Cole, had shared her love for nerdcore, appreciating how it focuses on video games, science fiction, and other niche interests. Trebek’s comment, meant as a joke, sparked outrage on social media. Despite the controversy, Cole won $22,600 and returned for another episode. The incident would later resurface on social media during the COVID-19 lockdown, leading fans to revisit the moment.

<text>Barker&#x27;s Bush is a forest located in the Grand River watershed near the banks of the Nith River in the community of Paris, County of Brant, Ontario, Canada. The bush is directly north and west of Lion&#x27;s Park, and less than one kilometre northwest of the confluence of the Nith and the Grand rivers.

Consisting of a mix of both coniferous and deciduous trees common to the Carolinian forests of southwestern Ontario, the bush itself is riddled with extensive bike and hiking trails which are used frequently, especially so through the warmer months (typically late Spring through early Fall).

The vast majority of Barkers Bush historically has been located on private property, however, trespassing has generally been accepted and the public has used the trails extensively for many years. Historically, the only public land entrance to the bush was through Lion&#x27;s Park, however, this changed in 2002 when the local municipality built a steel footbridge from the east banks of the Nith to the west banks located in the bush itself.

In 2016 Losani Homes purchased the agricultural fields in which Barkers Bush surrounds to develop a new subdivision, as well as some of the forest itself. In response the County of Brant bought roughly 100 acres of Barkers Bush in 2019 to preserve the rest of the forest and trails within it.

The skeletal remains of the river dam found at the southeastern edge of the bush are a relic from an era when shipping traffic was common on the Nith.

<doc id="627432" wikidata="Q486511" url="?curid=627432" title="Treaty of Westminster (1654)">
<text>The Treaty of Westminster, concluded between the Lord Protector of the English Commonwealth, Oliver Cromwell, and the States General of the United Netherlands, was signed on 5/15 April 1654. The treaty ended the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–1654). The treaty is otherwise notable because it is one of the first treaties implementing international arbitration as a method of conflict resolution in early modern times. A secret clause, obliging the States of Holland to enact the Act of Seclusion, played an important part in Dutch internal politics during the First Stadtholderless Period.

==Negotiations==
The negotiation of the treaty started long before the war. The Commonwealth of England had been established only in 1649, and the new state was seeking international recognition. Older established states, like the Dutch Republic, looked somewhat askance at the &quot;upstart&quot; England, which was ruled by &quot;king killers.&quot; The Dutch Republic had actively supported the royalist cause in the English Civil War because of the family ties between the stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange and the English royal family. The death of William II in 1650 and the establishment of a new States Party regime in the Dutch Republic cleared the way for a thaw in Anglo-Dutch diplomatic relations.

===Proposed union and counter-proposals===
The negotiations about better relations started in earnest in the Spring of 1651. Walter Strickland and Oliver St John went to The Hague to talk about the removal of the royalist exiles who had sought asylum in the Netherlands (among whom was the pretender Charles Stuart) from the Republic, but more importantly about a political union between the two states, on the ground that they were similar in respect of politics, religion, and commerce. The Dutch government replied with a number of counter-proposals in matters they held dear, like principles of (then-emerging) international law, such as freedom of the seas, limitation of the concept of contraband to &quot;instruments of war&quot;, freedom from capture of neutral goods on neutral ships in time of war. These were all matters that the English at the time disputed. Furthermore, the Dutch asked that letters of reprisal (a common practical cause of friction between states) should not be granted in peacetime. Finally, they asked that Dutch merchants should have the same privileges as the English in English dominions in Europe and the Americas. The demands, collected in 36 draft-articles, were presented to the English ambassadors on 14/24 June 1651. They returned to England without an agreement having been reached.

On 9/19 October 1651 the Commonwealth Parliament enacted the first of the Navigation Acts, which was perceived as aimed at the ruination of Dutch commerce, possibly on the instigation of St. John, who was aggrieved by his cool treatment in The Hague. This motivated the Dutch government to send a delegation of three commissioners: Cats, Van de Perre, and Schaep to London to reopen the negotiations about the 36 articles, and to gain suspension of the Navigation Act till the negotiations would have been completed. The latter demand was immediately rejected by the English Council of State, and the English negotiators upped the ante by formulating additional demands: reparations for alleged injuries to English commerce in Greenland, Brazil and the East Indies, and free access for the English E.I.C. to the East Indies (which had effectively been blocked by its Dutch competitor, the V.O.C.). Remarkably, the English offered at this time to acquiesce in this exclusion from the East Indies, but insisted on retaining the restrictions in the Navigation Act. At the same time, they declined to talk about the delineation of the Dutch and English possessions in North America (New Netherland and the New Haven Colony, respectively) about which a preliminary local agreement had been concluded, but not finalized by the metropolitan powers, in the Hartford Agreement of 19 September 1650.

===Diplomacy by other means ===
Meanwhile, relations between the two countries became tense, when, in answer to depredations of English privateers against neutral Dutch shipping in an undeclared maritime conflict between the Commonwealth and France, the Dutch started a program of naval expansion, by which the English (who had recently expanded their own fleet) felt threatened. After a naval incident about saluting the English flag in the &quot;English Seas&quot; the First Anglo-Dutch War started and the negotiations were suspended.

The war was lost militarily by the Dutch, who after a number of lost naval battles were blockaded in their own country by the Commonwealth Navy. This caused great economic hardship. On the other hand, the English in their turn were victimized by a wider Dutch &quot;encirclement&quot; that blocked English shipping from the Baltic by Denmark, a Dutch ally, aided by a strong Dutch naval detachment cruising near the Sound, and from South-East Asia by the V.O.C. English trade with the Mediterranean was also greatly hampered by Dutch privateering and naval activity, especially after the Battle of Leghorn. Both countries after a while were so economically exhausted that they hankered after peace.

===Peace negotiations===

Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell and Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt agreed to open peace negotiations in London in June 1653. The Dutch government sent a delegation, consisting of the commissioners Beverningh, Nieupoort (for the States of Holland), Van de Perre (for the States of Zeeland), and Jongestal (for the States of Friesland). Their English counterparts were Lawrence, Lambert, Montagu, and Lisle. The negotiations started where they had left off in 1652: the Dutch reiterated their 36 articles and demanded access to the American colonies; the English replied with a restatement of their demand for reparations and their previously rejected proposal for a political union between the two countries. Cromwell proposed that &quot;while the two countries should retain their municipal laws&quot; the two countries should &quot;be under one supreme power, consisting of representatives of both countries&quot; and &quot;natives of both countries should mutually enjoy their privileges, without any difference or distinction.&quot;

After Jongestal and Nieupoort had returned to The Hague to receive instructions regarding this startling proposal in mid-August 1653, the English side toned down the proposal in favor of a less far-reaching proposal for an alliance between the Protestant Powers of Europe and France, against the Catholic Powers, in which the Commonwealth and the Republic would take the lead; a commission, consisting of an equal number of members from each country, to determine differences peacefully; a joint fleet to &quot;secure the sea;&quot; liberty of the inhabitants of both countries to trade in Europe and overseas; the assignment of trade in East Asia solely to the Dutch in exchange for indemnification of the E.I.C.; the assignment of trade in the Americas (except Brazil, that was to be divided in influence spheres between the two countries) exclusively to the Commonwealth; and Dutch naval assistance to English attempts at conquest in Spanish America. (The two remaining Dutch ambassadors rejected the last proposal out of hand, as it would jeopardize the good relations which the Dutch Republic had recently established with Spain).

Jongestal and Nieuport returned in November 1653 with instructions to reject the proposed union, but to seek a close alliance commensurate with maintenance of Dutch independence. Later that month the English side presented a draft treaty of 27 articles. In two of those articles the phrase that subjects of both countries might trade in each other&#x27;s dominions &quot;saving the laws and ordinances of either commonwealth&quot; appeared. This phrase, though innocuous at first sight, represented the English intention to maintain the provisions of the Navigation Act. The Dutch representatives countered with amendments to the proposed articles that would free their commerce from the restrictions of the Act. In addition they proposed to regulate commerce outside Europe. This was followed by further exchanges of proposals that were unacceptable to one side or the other. Finally it was agreed to keep silent about regulation of trade outside Europe, and to recognize the right of both parties to reciprocal indemnification for injuries suffered (except those suffered in the course of the hostilities, for which reciprocal immunities were granted).

The treaty appeared ready for signing when suddenly two new obstacles were raised. In the first place the Dutch asked for the King of Denmark (their ally in the war) to be included in the treaty. Secondly, Cromwell demanded that the then-four-year-old Prince of Orange should be excluded from future government appointments, like the stadtholderate, or the captaincy-general of the States Army. The first demand was accepted, but the second at first appeared unacceptable to the Dutch ambassadors, who returned home. Secret direct negotiations between Cromwell and De Witt (represented by Beverningh), led to agreement on the matter of the exclusion of the Prince, however without the knowledge of the States General of the Netherlands. A secret clause, requiring the enactment of what became known as the Act of Seclusion by the States of Holland as a precondition for ratification of the treaty by the Commonwealth, would be added to the treaty that would only bind the States of Holland. The Dutch ambassadors returned to England after a few weeks&#x27; absence (only the representatives of Holland being aware of the secret clause) and completed the negotiations, tying up a number of loose ends, especially the important provisions in art. 30 of the treaty, laying down the principles of arbitration of mutual claims by a commission of equal representation convening in London, backed up by a provision charging the Protestant Swiss Cantons with binding arbitration, in case the arbiters in London could not reach agreement. The treaty was signed on 5/15 April 1654, and ratified by both states within a fortnight (ratification resolution of the States General 12/22 April 1654, Cromwell 19/29 April 1654).

==Aftermath==

With hindsight, the most momentous provision in the treaty was the secret clause concerning the Act of Seclusion. When the secret eventually leaked, it caused a political crisis in the Dutch Republic. Eventually, De Witt was able to remain in power, and the furore subsided. The Act of Seclusion remained in effect, playing a part in Dutch internal politics, until the very end of the De Witt regime, even after the Restoration seemingly obviated its existence.

The British historian Jonathan Israel writes that otherwise, taking into account that the Republic lost the war militarily, the treaty was remarkably lenient for the Dutch. He ascribes this to the diplomatic acumen of De Witt, who managed to avoid doing any major concession to England&#x27;s maritime and colonial interests. Cromwell did not achieve his main objectives: the coveted political union came to naught and the E.I.C. remained in fact blocked from freedom of trade in the East Indies (this freedom for British commerce would be achieved only in the Treaty of Paris of 1784, ending the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War).

On the other hand, the Dutch realized few of the objectives in their 36 articles. Matters like the freedom of the seas (as regards Dutch shipping), the principle of &quot;free ship, free goods&quot; (the inviolability of neutral shipping in time of war), and the restriction of the concept of contraband, had to wait till the Treaty of Breda (1667) and the Treaty of Westminster (1674).

The matter of the fraught phrase respecting the laws and ordinances of both states by each other&#x27;s merchants in each other&#x27;s dominions went by default when the Dutch commissioner Van de Perre died during the negotiations (He had been the champion of the Dutch West India Company which was especially hurt by the Navigation Act, and had therefore been the driving force behind the Dutch attempts to get the Act repealed, or at least amended). This clause therefore remained in the treaty, but the Dutch did not agree to interpret this as a recognition of the Navigation Act. Instead, the Dutch peace delegation remained behind to try and negotiate a repeal of the Act, but this effort was unsuccessful. This matter would have to wait also to the Breda treaty, in which the Dutch won concessions mitigating the Act (or rather its 1660 successor). Meanwhile, Dutch merchants honored the Act in the breach. However, in art. 12 of the treaty the parties accorded each other what would later become known as &quot;most favored nation&quot; status.
Of lasting importance was art. 30, which set up a commission to arbitrate all claims of both sides to which the treaty did not extend immunity (under e.g. articles 3 and 16). New here was that the principle of binding arbitration by a third party (the Protestant Swiss Cantons) was first agreed on as a means of conflict resolution in an international treaty.

The Dutch were also unsuccessful in obtaining ratification of the 1650 Hartford agreement concerning the border between New Netherland and Connecticut. This matter would be finally resolved by the transfer of New Netherland to England by the Treaty of Westminster of 1674.

The Dutch were forced to make three minor humiliating concessions. They promised to punish those culpable in the Amboyna Massacre exemplarily (art. 27). However, no such people were still alive to be punished, as the Dutch probably well knew. The matter of reparation for the affair was handled under the arbitration agreement of art. 30 of the treaty. The commissioner&#x27;s awarded a relatively trifling sum to the descendants of the victims of the affair.

Furthermore, the Dutch promised in art. 13 of the treaty to go on saluting the flag of English warships in the &quot;English Seas&quot; (i.e. mainly the English Channel) &quot;as in the times of Queen Elizabeth.&quot; This did not, however, imply an admission of sovereignty of England over those &quot;English Seas.&quot;

Thirdly, the treaty contained the provision that rebels designated by either of the two countries were to be banished. This first of all targeted the pretender Charles Stuart, who had since 1648 found asylum in the Republic at the court of his sister Mary and her husband stadtholder William II. He subsequently had to move to the Spanish Netherlands. Ironically, a similar clause was to be included in the treaties Charles II himself concluded with the Republic in 1662, 1667 and 1674, after his Restoration, but then aimed at the regicides.

The island Run in the East Indies, which had been claimed by the E.I.C. since at least 1623, but had always been denied to them by its rival, the militarily-stronger V.O.C., was formally ceded to the E.I.C. This cession, however, did not take practical effect till March 1665. The island was taken back by the V.O.C.in November 1666 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War and formally ceded to the V.O.C. by the Treaty of Breda in 1667 in part-exchange for New Netherland.

<text>Desmond Michael Lynam, (born 17 September 1942) is an Irish-born British television and radio presenter. In a broadcasting career spanning more than forty years, he has hosted television coverage of many of the world&#x27;s major sporting events, presenting &quot;Grandstand&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, Wimbledon, the Grand National, &quot;Sportsnight&quot;, the World Cup and Olympic Games, as well as presenting non-sporting programmes such as &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;How Do They Do That?&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot;.

==Early years==
Lynam was born in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, and moved with his family to Brighton, England, at the age of six. He recalled having a strong Irish accent at the time, but eventually lost it. He passed the eleven-plus in 1954, to attend Varndean Grammar School. After sitting his A-levels, he went into the insurance business.

==Broadcasting career==

===1968–1999===
Lynam started his career in broadcasting as a freelance radio journalist on BBC Radio Brighton (1968–1969). He quickly joined national BBC radio in London, and went on to anchor &quot;Sport on Two&quot; and &quot;Sports Report&quot; (1969–1978) on BBC Radio 2. From 1974 to 1976, he co-presented &quot;the Today programme&quot; on BBC Radio 4 on three mornings each week. He was also the radio boxing commentator for 20 years.

Lynam moved to television in 1977 starting off with &quot;Sportswide&quot; as part of &quot;Nationwide&quot; continuing until the series ended in 1983, and then presented &quot;Grandstand&quot; (1979–1991, occasionally until 1999), &quot;Sportsnight&quot; (1991–1997) and &quot;Match of the Day&quot; (1988–1999). He also fronted BBC coverage of Wimbledon (highlights 1983 to 1989 with Gerald Williams, main presenter 1991–1997 and 1999), the Grand National (1985–1999), the Football World Cup (1982–1998) and the Olympic Games (1980–1996).

In 1988 and 1989, Lynam presented the BBC series &quot;Holiday&quot;.

In April 1989, Lynam was present at the Hillsborough disaster whilst covering the FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest for &quot;Match of the Day&quot;.

Between 1988 and the end of the 1991–1992 season, the BBC had lost the rights for top flight league matches to ITV, although the BBC retained rights for the FA Cup. Lynam presented &quot;Match of the Day&quot; on FA Cup weekends for those four seasons. In August 1992, at the start of the new formation of the Premier League, the BBC regained highlights of top flight league matches. Lynam presented &quot;Match of the Day&quot; highlights of Premier League matches on the BBC until 1999.

Throughout his time on the BBC, Lynam was praised for his witty and down-to-earth style. In 1998, Lynam made a brief return to BBC Radio 2, presenting the 5–7pm Drivetime show on Fridays only. During this period, Johnnie Walker presented the show from Monday to Thursday.

===ITV: 1999–2004===
Lynam moved from the BBC to ITV in August 1999, to present ITV&#x27;s live football coverage, including coverage of the midweek UEFA Champions League. Lynam said at the time: &quot;Leaving the BBC after 30 years was not an easy decision to make, but it was time for a new challenge – and it&#x27;s no secret that live football is what I love best.&quot; A month earlier, Lynam had complained in a newspaper interview about BBC1&#x27;s late scheduling on a Saturday evening of &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, which had sometimes been shown with a late start time of 10.50pm. Lynam said: &quot;The moment you put it past 10.30 I start fuming.&quot;

ITV later gained a deal to air Premier League highlights. In 2001, Lynam presented &quot;The Premiership&quot;, which was first aired on ITV at 7pm on 18 August 2001. After disappointing viewing figures in the first couple of months for &quot;The Premiership&quot; on ITV, a decision was made to shift the programme from its original 7pm slot to a permanent later time of 10:30pm, from 17 November 2001. The programme ran until May 2004.

Lynam continued to present football coverage for ITV until 2004. He decided to retire from presenting live sport after the Euro 2004 football championships. Soon afterwards the BBC announced that Lynam would present a new weekly radio programme, &quot;Des Meets...&quot;, on BBC Radio Five Live from August 2004.

===2005–2013===
In May 2005, Lynam presented the BBC One programme &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot;, marking the 60th anniversary of VE Day. During the show Tara McDonald performed the song &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot; live. The following month, he presented an episode of &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; on BBC One, the third time he had presented the show, having twice hosted the show the previous year.

In June and July 2005, Lynam co-presented (with Sir David Frost) the series &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Sporting Legend&quot; on Sky One. In the summer of 2005, Lynam also covered the Wimbledon Championships for BBC Radio Five Live.

In October 2005, Lynam published his autobiography &quot;I Should Have Been at Work&quot;. The title of the book is a reference to when Lynam said &quot;Good afternoon. Shouldn&#x27;t you be at work?&quot; when introducing coverage of an England match at 2pm on a Monday during the 1998 Football World Cup finals.

In 2005, Lynam said that he regretted his decision to move to ITV from the BBC in 1999. Lynam said: &quot;If it was a decision I had to make now I probably wouldn&#x27;t do it. Some people said I went from being a great broadcaster, or at least a very acceptably good one, to being a somewhat inadequate one overnight&quot;.

Also that year, Lynam replaced Richard Whiteley as the host of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot;, with his first episode airing on 31 October 2005, following Whiteley&#x27;s death. Although his contract was to last until December 2007, Lynam left &quot;Countdown&quot; after less than 18 months at the end of 2006, because he regularly needed to travel to Leeds where &quot;Countdown&quot; was recorded, while his home was in Worthing, West Sussex about 250 miles away. He was replaced by Des O&#x27;Connor. Lynam did, however, return for Countdown&#x27;s 5000th episode, broadcast on 26 March 2010, as the Dictionary Corner guest.

After leaving &quot;Countdown&quot;, Lynam hosted &quot;Sport Mastermind&quot; and appeared in Setanta Sports&#x27; commercials for its coverage of the Premier League.

In April 2009, Lynam spoke about his recollection of the Hillsborough disaster for a &quot;Football Focus&quot; special programme marking the 20th anniversary of the disaster.

From 2011 to 2013, Lynam co-hosted, with Christopher Matthew, three series of &quot;Touchline Tales&quot; on BBC Radio 4, a humorous look at sport.

In a 2015 interview, Lynam stated that &quot;I liked the radio boxing commentaries very much, especially following Muhammad Ali around the world. That was a great period of my life.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lynam married Susan Skinner on 2 October 1965 and they had one son, Patrick (born 1970); however, by 1973 the marriage began to break down owing to Lynam&#x27;s career commitments, and they divorced in 1974. Lynam married his long-term partner, Rosemary Diamond, in 2011. They live together in West Sussex.

Lynam is a supporter of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. In the 1990s he declined an invitation to join the board of directors at Brighton.

He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours.

In May 2013, Lynam endorsed the UK Independence Party (UKIP), revealing that he voted for the party in local elections that year.

<text>South Jersey, also known as Southern New Jersey, comprises the southern portion of the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located between Pennsylvania and the lower Delaware River to its west, the Atlantic Ocean to its east, Delaware to its south, and Central Jersey or North Jersey to its north, depending on the definition of North Jersey.

South Jersey is part of the Delaware Valley, the seventh-largest metropolitan region in the nation with 6.288 million residents in the core metropolitan statistical area and 7.366 million residents in the combined statistical area of Camden, Philadelphia and Wilmington, as of 2020. South Jersey is known for containing the unique ecoregion known as the Pine Barrens, which remains largely undisturbed despite its location within the Northeastern megalopolis. The South Jersey Pine Barrens are the largest remaining example of the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecosystem.
Benjamin Franklin is said to have called New Jersey &quot;a barrel tapped at both ends&quot;, referencing the Philadelphia influence on South Jersey and the New York City influence on North Jersey. South Jersey is defined geographically as the area below I-195 that includes the state&#x27;s lower seven counties: Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, and Salem, and occasionally an eighth, Ocean. 

South Jersey and the wider Philadelphia metropolitan area are situated near the center of the Northeast megalopolis and have become a U.S. East Coast epicenter for logistics and warehouse construction; Salem County, the lower portion of Gloucester County, and the upper portion of Cumberland County additionally serve as residential communities for the petrochemical industry of New Castle County, Delaware. South Jersey shore communities, including Atlantic City and others in Atlantic and Cape May counties, have a distinct economy centered around the tourism industry. Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester counties have several older streetcar towns, and many residents from these three counties commute to Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth-most populous city, which is located immediately west of South Jersey across the Delaware River, accessible by the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, Betsy Ross Bridge, Tacony Palmyra Bridge and Walt Whitman Bridge.

The designation of South Jersey with a distinct toponym is a colloquialism rather than an administrative definition and reflects geographical and perceived cultural and other differences between South Jersey and the northern part of the state.

==Geography==

===Topography===

South Jersey is a peninsula bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to its southeast, the Delaware Bay to its southwest, and the Delaware River to its northwest. All of South Jersey is part of the Atlantic Plain, a landform of broad plains and gently sloping hills that extends southward from the New York Bight to Florida. Much of the Atlantic Plain is covered by pine and oak-pine forests and salt marshes and is underlain by poorly consolidated sedimentary formations from the Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary ages that dip seaward. The Atlantic Coastal Plain can be divided into three physiographic subprovinces: the Inner Lowlands, Outer Lowlands, and Central Uplands. 

The Inner Lowlands region encompasses the low valley along the Delaware River, with an elevation ranging from to , and the Outer Lowlands encompasses the area near the Atlantic Ocean with an elevation that rarely exceeds . The Inner Lowlands are fertile due to the deposition of sediment in the region, which makes it an ideal region for agriculture. The Outer Lowlands is dominated by coastal estuaries, swamplands, and barrier islands near the Atlantic Ocean and is generally infertile. The Central Uplands varies slightly from the Lowlands in altitude and is covered by the New Jersey Pine Barrens. The Uplands has rolling hills at an elevation over 50 feet, rarely exceeding 200 feet in elevation, along with sandy, acidic soil that is unsuitable for agriculture. Commercial farming in the Pine Barrens is limited to plants that thrive in its nutrient-poor soil, generally restricted to acidic fruits. In the Pine Barrens, cranberries and blueberries are cultivated in lowland bogs that have accumulated depths of organic matter.

===Climate===
South Jersey has a humid subtropical climate. Compared to northern parts of New Jersey, South Jersey has slightly higher temperatures and receives less annual precipitation. Along the Jersey Shore, temperatures are moderated by sea breezes.

==Counties==
The following seven counties are completely included in South Jersey:
* Atlantic County
* Burlington County
* Camden County
* Cape May County
* Cumberland County
* Gloucester County
* Salem County

Some definitions of South Jersey include the southern portion of Ocean County.

In April 2015, an NJ.com poll with 90,000 respondents asked readers to identify the communities in North, Central, and South Jersey. Barnegat, Eagleswood, Lacey Township, Little Egg Harbor, Long Beach Island, Ocean Township, Stafford Township, and Tuckerton were all voted as part of South Jersey. The Ocean County communities north of Lacey Township were considered to be part of Central Jersey. The northernmost communities of Burlington County was also voted part of Central Jersey.

==Cities==
===Principal cities===

Camden, located across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, has historically been considered the economic hub of South Jersey. Much of Camden&#x27;s growth resulted from its location near Philadelphia and its role as a regional transportation hub. For decades following World War II, Camden suffered a prolonged economic decline and high crime rate due to the loss of its manufacturing base and the outflow of middle-class residents to the suburbs. Campbell&#x27;s Soup headquarters and the new corporate headquarters of Susquehanna Bank. Rutgers University–Camden, Rutgers Law School, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Cooper University Hospital, and the Camden campus of Camden County College operate in Camden, and the Camden Waterfront is one of the city&#x27;s main attractions. Nearby, Cherry Hill, the second largest municipality in South Jersey and the 12th largest in New Jersey by population, is an edge city that also serves as a regional economic center. Pureland Industrial Complex, the nation&#x27;s largest industrial park, is located 12 miles from the port of Camden in Logan Township.

Atlantic City is a major tourist destination that is famous for its beaches, boardwalk, and casino gambling. Atlantic City is located in the Jersey Shore region on Absecon Island, along with Ventnor City, Margate City, and Longport. Atlantic City became a resort town in 1854, when train service to the city allowed beachgoers from Philadelphia to vacation in the city. The first boardwalk in the world opened in the city in 1870, and large hotels were built in the early 20th century to accommodate visitors. In the mid-20th century, Atlantic City declined as a tourist destination due to competition from other resorts made accessible by automobile and aircraft. After New Jersey voters approved casino gambling in Atlantic City in a 1976 referendum, it became the first legalized casino gambling destination in the Eastern United States. Recent growth in the city has been fueled by the casino industry, and Atlantic City is the second-largest casino gaming market in the United States behind Las Vegas.

===Metropolitan areas===
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester Counties are part of the Camden metropolitan division with an estimated population of 1,250,569 as of 2008. Salem County is part of the Wilmington metropolitan division. The Camden and Wilmington metropolitan divisions are part of the larger Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington metropolitan statistical area, the eighth largest MSA in the U.S. Cumberland County is part of the Vineland–Millville–Bridgeton Metropolitan Statistical Area. Atlantic City and its surrounding region in Atlantic County are part of the Atlantic City metropolitan area, which had an estimated 2008 population of 270,681. Cape May County is part of the Ocean City metropolitan area with an estimated 2008 population of 95,838. Atlantic, Cape May, and Cumberland counties are all part of the Philadelphia-Camden-Vineland combined statistical area.

Ocean County, with a 2020 population of 637,229, is considered part of the New York–North Jersey–Long Island Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of North Jersey and Central Jersey with the exception of Warren County. However, much of Ocean County lies in both New York City and Philadelphia media markets.

==Population==

==History==
===Native Americans===
Present-day South Jersey was first inhabited by the Lenape and was the site of the first Indian reservation. The tribe spoke Unami dialects, part of the Algonquian language family. Because the Lenape were concentrated around the Delaware River and its tributaries, Europeans later named them the Delaware Indians. After the arrival of the Europeans, the Lenape population dwindled quickly due to disease and conflict. Those who were left migrated north or west, or became integrated into local settler communities.

===Colonial period===

Although present-day South Jersey was claimed by the Dutch in 1609, the Dutch used the region primarily for trading purposes. In 1638, New Sweden was established along the Delaware River. The Swedes established two permanent settlements in present-day South Jersey: Swedesboro and Bridgeport, formerly named New Stockholm. New Sweden was captured by the Dutch in 1655, and remained part of New Netherland until its cession to the British in 1667.

During the British colonial period, nearly all of South Jersey was part of the Province of West Jersey between 1674 and 1702 as a Quaker commonwealth. Burlington, the capital of West Jersey, was established in 1677, and Camden was established in 1681. Since the Delaware River was not easily navigable north of Trenton, the population was concentrated along the southern Delaware River. The borders between West Jersey and East Jersey, first surveyed using the Keith line, ran diagonally across the middle part of the state. The borders remained important in determining ownership and political boundaries until 1745. Remnants of that division are seen today, notably as the Burlington-Monmouth and Burlington-Ocean County lines and the municipal boundaries within Ocean County. In contemporary culture, the border signifies a functional boundary between the New York City and Philadelphia spheres of influence.

By 1700, nearly 70% of the population of West Jersey were Quakers of English or Irish origin. The Quakers, who believed in peace, equality, and integrity, influenced early New Jersey. In contrast, East Jersey had high proportions of Scottish and Dutch settlers. In 1702, East Jersey and West Jersey were reunited under the reign of Queen Anne.

===American Revolution===
Resistance to the British was widespread during the American Revolution among South Jersey Presbyterians, who aided the colonists during the Revolutionary War. Several Presbyterian preachers, including John Brainerd, accepted military positions and urged Presbyterians to enlist in the army. During the war, the Delaware River was strategic for its commercial importance and its role in defending Philadelphia. General Howe captured Philadelphia in September 1777, occupying the city for 10 months. The Quakers as a whole were opposed to the Revolution on their principles of nonviolence. Members of the Religious Society of Friends were forbidden to support the local militias, or faced disownment by the Quakers.

===19th century===

For many years, South Jersey has been mistakenly perceived solely as an agricultural society. In the 18th century, South Jersey, including Alloway in Salem County, was home to Wistarburg, the first successful glass factory in the colonies, operating for close to 50 years prior to the Revolutionary War. When that factory closed, the workers spread throughout the region to South Jersey towns, including Millville, Vineland Bridgeton, Hammonton, and Glassboro where they established new companies. Recent research has uncovered evidence that, in addition to the glassmaking industry, South Jersey was also a major contributor to the iron, coal making, ship building and, later, textile industries. Other businesses that later operated in the region included shoe manufacturers, button makers, barrel makers, and rug companies. While most industries eventually declined, farming still made up the larger portion of the region&#x27;s economy. South Jersey&#x27;s interior, consisting of the New Jersey Pine Barrens and marshland, remained unpopulated because its acidic, nutrient-poor soil that was unsuited for farming. Most of the cities were concentrated along the Delaware River except for a few settlements and seaside resorts along the Jersey Shore.

Slavery was less extensive in South Jersey than it was in other parts of the state because of the Quakers&#x27; religious opposition to it, and a lower demand for labor in the region. By 1810, the population of slaves dwindled to 328 total, compared to 10,532 total slaves in the rest of New Jersey. Although discriminatory policies still targeted blacks, South Jersey became a haven for ex-slaves. William Still, a notable African-American abolitionist, was born in Burlington County, and is nicknamed the &quot;father of the Underground Railroad&quot; for his role in helping slaves escape to freedom.

Railroads came into operation in South Jersey by the mid-19th century. The advent of the railroad was one of the reasons Charles K. Landis was inspired to found Vineland in 1861. The rail system expanded dramatically during that period, helping a number of towns to grow and thrive. Many of the railroads were later consolidated into the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad (WJ&amp;S). By 1925, it operated 379 miles of road on 717 miles of track. In 1933, it became part of Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines, a Pennsylvania Railroad subsidiary. Much of the system is part of the South Jersey/Philadelphia Shared Assets Area. The Glassboro–Camden Line, a light rail system, is currently under construction.

===20th century===

Beginning in the early 20th century, the towns bordering the Delaware River saw increased manufacturing due to improved transportation and technology. A year before the turn of the century, in 1899, John Thompson Dorrance, a chemist for Campbell Soup Company, perfected his method of canning condensed soup. This allowed Campbell to ship and sell its product at one-third the cost. Campbell had national distribution by 1911 when its products were first marketed in California. The New York Shipbuilding Corporation opened its first shipyard in 1900 in Camden. The company produced a variety of ships, ranging from aircraft carriers and battleships to luxury liners and barges. By 1917, NYSB was the world&#x27;s largest shipyard. The Victor Talking Machine Company, founded in 1901, became the leading American producer of phonographs and phonograph records.

Like many American cities after World War II, South Jersey cities where heavy manufacturing was a predominant industry declined as factories closed and residents moved away. Suburbanization of the region was fueled by the construction of new highways and bridges, and increased automobile ownership. The New Jersey Turnpike opened in 1951, permitting fast travel by car between New York and Delaware. In 1955, William Levitt built present-day Willingboro based on his Levittown model, which came to be used for other suburban developments. The population of Delaware Township in Camden County rose explosively after World War II, growing from about 10,000 residents in 1950 to almost 65,000 by 1970. In 1961, the township was renamed Cherry Hill. In contrast, nearby Camden declined from 125,000 residents in 1950 to 85,000 in 1980. While the South Jersey suburbs remain general middle-class, the inner cities continue to face issues with crime, poverty, and unemployment.

====Statehood movement====
Albert Freeman, a Mount Holly newspaper publisher and editor, wrote an editorial calling for secession. Freeman originally meant the proposal as a joke, but the idea gained momentum. On April 23, 1980, the town council of Egg Harbor voted to support the creation of a new state of South Jersey. The statehood movement was an attempt to gain the attention of state lawmakers, centering on issues such as the construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex in the north while the state refused to support the Garden State Park Racetrack in the south. A non-binding referendum was presented to six counties in 1980 (with the exclusion of Camden and Gloucester counties), and 51 percent of voters declared that they wanted to secede and establish a new state; Ocean County was the only southern county of six that voted to defeat the referendum.

==Economic environment==
In 2005, &quot;Money magazine&quot; declared Moorestown as the &quot;best place to live&quot; in the United States, although they stated that a number of nearby municipalities could have just as easily been given the distinction.

Conversely, Morgan Quitno has rated nearby Camden the &quot;most dangerous city&quot; in the United States three times within the same decade and Camden had a median household income of $18,007 in 2006, making it the poorest U.S. city with over 65,000 residents. Moorestown and Camden share a central highway, NJ County Road 537.

== Demographics ==
The average income for a household in South Jersey was $63,834.54, and the population was 65.3% non-Hispanic White, 15.9% non-Hispanic Black, 11.6% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 4.2% non-Hispanic Asian, and 3.0% non-Hispanic other or mixed race. South Jersey had a total population of 1,854,453 in 2010 (up from 693,402 in 1940) if the counties of Camden, Burlington, Gloucester, Salem, Atlantic, Cape May, and Cumberland are included.

Rutgers also has a number of research field stations located in South Jersey, including the Philip E. Marucci Center for Blueberry and Cranberry Research and Extension in Chatsworth and the Rutgers University Marine Field Station in Tuckerton.

==Sports==
Many South Jerseyans root for Philadelphia professional sports teams including the Phillies, Eagles, Flyers, 76ers, and Union. In southern Ocean County, there is a strong mix of Philadelphia and New York sports fans since the county&#x27;s media markets overlap. While there are no major league teams in South Jersey, in recent seasons the 76ers have held training camp at Stockton University in Galloway Township. In 2016, the 76ers opened a practice facility on the Camden waterfront. The Flyers practice in Voorhees at the local Skate Zone.

South Jersey has been home to a number of minor league teams. The Jersey Shore BlueClaws play in Lakewood and are an affiliate of the Phillies. Minor league soccer is also played in South Jersey, as the Ocean City Nor&#x27;easters of the Premier Development League are based in Ocean City. The Nor&#x27;easters play their home games at Carey Stadium.

In 2007, the WNBA was considering expansion in Atlantic City. The Atlantic City ownership group competed with other groups from Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, Albuquerque, Colorado, and the San Francisco Bay Area. In the end, the expansion franchise was awarded to Atlanta.

South Jersey was home to the now-defunct independent league baseball teams the Atlantic City Surf and Camden Riversharks. Outside of baseball, South Jersey was also home to the Atlantic City Boardwalk Bullies, a minor league ice hockey team affiliated with the East Coast Hockey League. The Jersey Knights of the World Hockey Association played at the Cherry Hill Arena in Cherry Hill from 1973 to 1974. Previously, the minor league Jersey Devils of the Eastern Hockey League played at the same location from 1964 to 1973.

==South Jersey English==

South Jersey is within the Philadelphia dialect region. One recognizable feature of this is the pronunciation of (the vowel in &quot;go&quot;) as , and this can also be found elsewhere in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware.

Visitors to South Jersey will notice the following usages standard in the Delaware Valley:
* &quot;Hoagie&quot;: This usual term for what might elsewhere be called a submarine sandwich.
* &quot;Wooder&quot;: the first syllable in the word &quot;water&quot; is pronounced like the word &quot;wood&quot;.
* &quot;Jimmies&quot;: used to refer to the chocolate or rainbow variety of sprinkles used on cakes and ice cream. The term is also used in the Boston area but is uncommon in North Jersey.
* &quot;Down the shore&quot;: To head &quot;down the shore&quot; is to spend time in the Jersey coastal resort areas. Once you are down the shore, for the day or at a residence in the area, you can go to the beach, or the boardwalk, and so forth. The phrase was even used as the name of a short-lived sitcom, &quot;Down the Shore&quot;, although this was set in central New Jersey.
* &quot;Shoobie&quot;: slang used by year-long residents of the coast for vacationing visitors to the shore, often from Philadelphia or New York City.

<text>Gerald A. &quot;Tooky&quot; Amirault (born March 1, 1954) is an American convicted in 1986 of child sexual abuse of eight children at the Fells Acres Day School in Malden, Massachusetts, run by his family. He and his family deny the charges, which supporters regard as a conspicuous example of day-care sex-abuse hysteria. Amirault was released from prison on parole on April 30, 2004.

==Accusations and trial==
Amirault was arrested in September 1984 on charges of sexually abusing a child at his family&#x27;s day care facility, which promptly had its license to operate suspended by the state of Massachusetts. His mother and sister, Violet Amirault and Cheryl Amirault LeFave, respectively, were also later arrested.

At Amirault&#x27;s 1986 trial, the prosecution relied heavily on testimony from young children extracted through long sessions with therapists. Amirault was convicted of assaulting and raping nine children and sentenced to 30 to 40 years in prison. In 1987, in a separate trial, his mother and sister were convicted of similar crimes against four children and sentenced to jail for eight to 20 years.
===Criticism===
The Amiraults insist they were victims of the day-care sex-abuse hysteria that swept the US in the 1980s.

Dorothy Rabinowitz, a member of the Editorial Board of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, asserts that Amirault was railroaded. She wrote that &quot;Other than such testimony, the prosecutors had no shred of physical or other proof that could remotely pass as evidence of abuse&quot;. Among the accusations were, as summarized by Rabinowitz from court records, Amirault 

Rabinowitz was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 2001, partly for her coverage of the case. The case was also the major topic of her book about miscarriages of justice, &quot;No Crueler Tyrannies&quot;.

==Post-trial==
In 1995, Judge Robert Barton ordered a new trial for Violet, then 72, and Cheryl, who both had been imprisoned eight years. He ordered the women released at once and expressed his contempt for the prosecutors. Barton found that their convictions were wrongful because they were not able to directly confront their accusers. A similar appeal on behalf of Gerald was denied later that year.

In 1997, Superior Court Judge Isaac Borenstein presided over a widely publicized hearing into the case resulting in findings that all the children&#x27;s testimony was tainted. He said that &quot;Every trick in the book had been used to get the children to say what the investigators wanted.&quot; &quot;Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly&quot; published a scathing editorial in September 1999 directed at the prosecutors &quot;who seemed unwilling to admit they might have sent innocent people to jail for crimes that had never occurred.&quot; Violet died in 1997. Cheryl&#x27;s conviction was ultimately upheld, but she avoided returning to prison by reaching a deal with prosecutors in October 1999.

In 2000, the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Board of Pardons and Paroles met to consider a commutation of Gerald Amirault&#x27;s sentence. After nine months of investigation, the board voted 5–0, with one abstention, to commute his sentence, although no exculpatory evidence was presented. Also newsworthy was an added statement, signed by a majority of the board, which pointed to the lack of evidence against the Amiraults, and the &quot;extraordinary if not bizarre allegations&quot; on which they had been convicted.

In 2002, then–Acting Governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift refused to commute Amirault&#x27;s sentence, despite a unanimous vote in favor of his release by the state&#x27;s parole board. Amirault&#x27;s case had previously been upheld by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Martha Coakley, then Middlesex County district attorney and subsequently Massachusetts Attorney General, lobbied Swift to keep him in prison. Swift denied Amirault&#x27;s clemency.

Amirault was ultimately released on parole from the Bay State Correctional Center on April 30, 2004, 18 years after his conviction. Accusers criticized his early release.

Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker recommended Gerald Amirault and his sister Cheryl Amirault LeFave for pardon on November 18, 2022, subject to approval by the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council. The pardon recommendation was withdrawn by Baker on December 14, 2022, as &quot;there didn’t appear to be enough support&quot; within the council.

<doc id="627468" wikidata="Q745766" url="?curid=627468" title="Pyrethroid">
<text>A pyrethroid is an organic compound similar to the natural pyrethrins, which are produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (&quot;Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium&quot; and &quot;C. coccineum&quot;). Pyrethroids are used as commercial and household insecticides.

In household concentrations pyrethroids are generally harmless to humans. However, pyrethroids are toxic to insects such as bees, dragonflies, mayflies, gadflies, and some other invertebrates, including those that constitute the base of aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Pyrethroids are toxic to aquatic organisms, especially fish. They have been shown to be an effective control measure for malaria outbreaks, through indoor applications.

==Mode of action==
Pyrethroids are excitotoxic to axons. They act by preventing the closure of the voltage-gated sodium channels in the axonal membranes. The sodium channel is a membrane protein with a hydrophilic interior. This interior is shaped precisely to allow sodium ions to pass through the membrane, enter the axon, and propagate an action potential. When the toxin keeps the channels in their open state, the nerves cannot repolarize, leaving the axonal membrane permanently depolarized, thereby paralyzing the organism. Pyrethroids can be combined with the synergist piperonyl butoxide, a known inhibitor of microsomal P450 enzymes which are important in metabolizing the pyrethroid. By that means, the efficacy (lethality) of the pyrethroid is increased. It is likely that there are other mechanisms of intoxication also. Disruption of neuroendocrine activity is thought to contribute to their irreversible effects on insects, which indicates a pyrethroid action on voltage-gated calcium channels (and perhaps other voltage-gated channels more widely).

==Chemistry and classification==

Pyrethroids are classified based on their mechanism of biological action, as they do not share a common chemical structure. Many are 2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid derivatives, like chrysanthemic acid, esterified with an alcohol. However, the cyclopropyl ring does not occur in all pyrethroids. Fenvalerate, which was developed in 1972, is one such example and was the first commercialized pyrethroid without that group. 

Pyrethroids which lack an α-cyano group are often classified as &quot;type I pyrethroids&quot; and those with it are called &quot;type II pyrethroids&quot;. Pyrethroids that have a common name starting with &quot;cy&quot; have a cyano group and are type II. Fenvalerate also contains an α-cyano group.

Some pyrethroids, like etofenprox, also lack the ester bond found in most other pyrethroids and have an ether bond in its place. Silafluofen is also classified as a pyrethroid and has a silicon atom in the place of the ester. Pyrethroids often have chiral centers and only certain stereoisomers work efficiently as insecticides.

==Examples==

*Allethrin, the first pyrethroid synthesized 
*Bifenthrin, active ingredient of &quot;Talstar&quot;, &quot;Capture&quot;, &quot;Ortho Home Defense Max&quot;, and &quot;Bifenthrine&quot;

==Safety==
===Environmental effects===
Pyrethroids are toxic to insects such as bees, dragonflies, mayflies, gadflies, and some other invertebrates, including those that constitute the base of aquatic and terrestrial food webs. They are toxic to aquatic organisms including fish.

Pyrethroids are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, however when associated with sediment they can persist for some time.

Pyrethroids are unaffected by conventional secondary treatment systems at municipal wastewater treatment facilities. They appear in the effluent, usually at levels lethal to invertebrates.

===Humans===
Pyrethroid absorption can happen via skin, inhalation or ingestion. Pyrethroids often do not bind efficiently to mammalian sodium channels. They also absorb poorly via skin and human liver is often able to metabolize them relatively efficiently. Pyrethroids are thus much less toxic to humans than to insects. 

It is not well established if chronic exposure to small amounts of pyrethroids is hazardous or not. However, large doses can cause acute poisoning, which is rarely life threatening. Typical symptoms include facial paresthesia, itching, burning, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and more severe cases of muscle twitching. Severe poisoning is often caused by ingestion of pyrethroids and can result in a variety of symptoms like seizures, coma, bleeding or pulmonary edema. There is an association of pyrethroids with poorer early social-emotional and language development.

===Other organisms===
Pyrethroids are very toxic to cats, but not to dogs. Poisoning in cats can result in seizures, fever, ataxia and even death. Poisoning can occur if pyrethroid containing flea treatment products, which are intended for dogs, are used on cats. The livers of cats detoxify pyrethroids via glucuronidation more poorly than dogs, which is the cause of this difference. Aside from cats, pyrethroids are typically not toxic to mammals or birds. They are often toxic to fish, reptiles and amphibians.

==Resistance==

The use of pyrethroids as insecticides has led to the development of widespread resistance to them among some insect populations, especially mosquitoes.

Pyrethroids have been used against bedbugs, but resistant populations have developed to them. Populations of diamondback moths have also commonly developed resistance to pyrethroids including in U.S. states North Dakota and Wisconsin while pyrethroids are still recommended in California. Various mosquito populations have been discovered to have a high level of resistance, including &quot;Anopheles gambiae s.l.&quot; in West Africa by Chandre et al 1999 through Pwalia et al 2019, &quot;A. arabiensis&quot; in Sudan by Ismail et al 2018 and The Gambia by Opondo et al 2019, and &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; in South East Asia by Amelia-Yap et al 2018, Papua New Guinea by Demok et al 2019, and various other locations by Smith et al 2016.

 (&quot;kdr&quot;) is one of the stronger kinds of resistance. &quot;kdr&quot; mutations confer target-site resistance to DDT and pyrethroids and cross-resistance to DDT. Most &quot;kdr&quot; mutations are within or proximate to the two arthropod sodium channel genes.

==History==
Pyrethroids were introduced by a team of Rothamsted Research scientists in the 1960s and 1970s following the elucidation of the structures of pyrethrin I and II by Hermann Staudinger and Leopold Ružička in the 1920s. The pyrethroids represented a major advancement in the chemistry that would synthesize the analog of the natural version found in pyrethrum. Its insecticidal activity has relatively low mammalian toxicity and an unusually fast biodegradation. Their development coincided with the identification of problems with DDT use. Their work consisted firstly of identifying the most active components of pyrethrum, extracted from East African chrysanthemum flowers and long known to have insecticidal properties. Pyrethrum rapidly knocks down flying insects but has negligible persistence — which is good for the environment but gives poor efficacy when applied in the field. Pyrethroids are essentially chemically stabilized forms of natural pyrethrum and belong to IRAC MoA group 3 (they interfere with sodium transport in insect nerve cells).

The &quot;first-generation pyrethroids&quot;, developed in the 1960s, include bioallethrin, tetramethrin, resmethrin, and bioresmethrin. They are more active than the natural pyrethrum but are unstable in sunlight. With the 91/414/EEC review, many 1st-generation compounds have not been included on Annex 1, probably because the market is not big enough to warrant the costs of re-registration (rather than any special concerns about safety).

By 1974, the Rothamsted team had discovered a &quot;second generation&quot; of more persistent compounds notably: permethrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin. They are substantially more resistant to degradation by light and air, thus making them suitable for use in agriculture, but they have significantly higher mammalian toxicities. Over the subsequent decades these derivatives were followed with other proprietary compounds such as fenvalerate, lambda-cyhalothrin and beta-cyfluthrin. Most patents have now expired, making these compounds cheap and therefore popular (although permethrin and fenvalerate have not been re-registered under the 91/414/EEC process).

<doc id="627473" wikidata="Q781134" url="?curid=627473" title="Thomas Cushing">
<text>Thomas Cushing III (March 24, 1725 – February 28, 1788) was an American lawyer, merchant, and statesman from Boston, Massachusetts. Active in Boston politics, he represented the city in the provincial assembly from 1761 to its dissolution in 1774, serving as the lower house&#x27;s speaker for most of those years. Because of his role as speaker, his signature was affixed to many documents protesting British policies, leading officials in London to consider him a dangerous radical. He engaged in extended communications with Benjamin Franklin who at times lobbied on behalf of the legislature&#x27;s interests in London, seeking ways to reduce the rising tensions of the American Revolution.

Cushing represented Massachusetts in the First (during which he signed the Continental Association) and Second Continental Congresses but was voted out when he opposed independence. Despite this, he remained politically active after independence, continuing to serve in the state government. During the Revolutionary War, he was a commissary responsible for provisioning the military, a position he used to enrich the family merchant business. He was elected the state&#x27;s first lieutenant governor in 1780. Politically associated with fellow merchant Governor John Hancock, he remained lieutenant governor until his death in 1788, briefly serving as acting governor in 1785 between the resignation of Hancock and the election of James Bowdoin.

==Early years==

Thomas was born in Boston, the capital of the British Province of Massachusetts Bay, on March 24, 1725, the second of at least seven children. The Cushing family, with deep roots in the province, descends from Deacon Matthew Cushing who emigrated from Norfolk, England, to Hingham in 1638. Thomas&#x27; father, also named Thomas (1694–1746), was one of the city&#x27;s wealthiest merchants, a leading member of the Old South Church, and a city selectman. Thomas Sr. was a frequent moderator of town meetings and accepted on behalf of the city of Boston the gift of Faneuil Hall (a large market building and public meeting space) from Peter Faneuil in 1742. He served in the General Court (colonial assembly) of Massachusetts from 1731 to 1747, and as its speaker after 1742. His mother, Mary (Bromfield) Cushing (1689–1746), was also from a prominent Boston family.

Thomas got his early education at the Boston Latin School and then attended Harvard where he graduated in 1744. He studied law and was admitted to the bar, after which he entered the family merchant business. On October 1, 1747, he married Deborah Fletcher (c. 1727–1790), with whom he had five children.

==Political career==
In 1753, Cushing entered politics, winning election as a Boston selectman. He continued in that office until 1763 and was also elected to the general court in 1761. He became politically associated with Samuel Adams and John Hancock, in part through his attendance at political discussions in Boston&#x27;s taverns. With Hancock in particular he eventually formed a lifelong relationship in which the charismatic Hancock was seen to be the dominant political personality. He contributed financially to some of Hancock&#x27;s political spending, although he preferred to stand in the background and let Hancock receive the credit. Because of this, his (and Hancock&#x27;s) political opponents in later years often characterized him as little more than Hancock&#x27;s henchman or proxy.

When the French and Indian War came to an end in 1763, the British government sought to recover the costs of posting troops in the colonies by imposing taxes on the colonies. Cushing was an early opponent of these taxes, couching his opposition in economic terms, a reflection on his livelihood as a merchant. An astute observer of the trade ties binding the various parts of the British Empire, he wrote in 1763 that extant high duties on molasses (payment of which was widely flouted by New England merchants) would have significantly harmed the economies of Britain, North America, and the West Indies, in part by diverting significant quantities of scarce hard currency to those duties. John Adams wrote of Cushing that &quot;[He] is steady and constant and busy in the interest of liberty and the opposition, and is famed for secrecy and his talent for procuring intelligence.&quot;

===Speaker of the house===
In May 1766 Cushing was chosen to be speaker of the assembly. The assembly first chose James Otis, but Governor Bernard rejected this choice, and Cushing was named as a compromise candidate. During his tenure as speaker he was a frequent correspondent with the assembly&#x27;s agent in London, Benjamin Franklin, who was given the job in late 1770. In addition to official correspondence such as petitions, the two men exchanged opinions on political developments in their respective areas and were broadly in agreement on the need for moderation in dealing with the British government. In 1772, Franklin acquired letters written by several royal appointees, including Governor Thomas Hutchinson when he was still lieutenant governor. Seeking to deflect colonial blame for matters away from the British government and onto the royal governor, Franklin forwarded these letters to Cushing, with specific instructions that they only be shown to a few people. Those who saw them included the radical Samuel Adams, who engineered their eventual publication in 1773. In the letters, Hutchinson and Lieutenant Governor Andrew Oliver made highly inflammatory suggestions that colonial rights needed to be abridged. The resulting scandal inflamed political tensions on both sides of the Atlantic, prompted a petition from the assembly that Hutchinson be recalled, and brought about Franklin&#x27;s resignation as colonial agent and conversion to a pro-independence view after he was publicly lambasted for his role in the affair.

Cushing held the post of speaker until the assembly was dissolved in October 1774 by Governor and British Army General Thomas Gage, who succeeded Hutchinson. The assembly&#x27;s members then met without the governor&#x27;s permission and formed the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. This body would constitute the &quot;de facto&quot; government of Massachusetts until its state constitution was adopted in 1780.

Despite his opposition to British policies, Cushing did not at first strongly support the revolution. In 1772, he (along with Hancock, who was also then moderate in his views) refused to serve when named to one of the Boston Committees of correspondence. Despite his lack of revolutionary ardor, he was elected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and to the second in 1775. He became associated with the radical cause by London political figures in part because, as Massachusetts speaker, his signature was affixed to all of its petitions. As a result, orders issued to General Gage in April 1775 for the arrest of radical leaders included Cushing&#x27;s name. Gage did not pursue such orders for the arrest of leaders, and Cushing was never detained.

===American Revolution===

Cushing continued to maintain a weak attitude toward independence through 1775, which cost him his seat in the Continental Congress in December 1775. After a heated election campaign, Cushing was defeated by Elbridge Gerry, who was committed to independence. The loss, which decisively handed pro-independence forces a majority in the Massachusetts delegation, propelled Cushing firmly into Hancock&#x27;s camp. Cushing continued to oppose independence upon his return to Massachusetts, orchestrating delays in the polling process by which the state formally called for a declaration of independence.

Hancock, the president of the Continental Congress, rewarded Cushing&#x27;s loyalty by securing for him the appointment as a commissioner of marine affairs. In this role Cushing oversaw the procurement of two 32-gun frigates for the Continental Navy. He was also appointed the chief commissary responsible for supplying Massachusetts troops, a post he held for several years. In 1780, he was appointed as one of the chief commissaries responsible for supplying the French troops at Newport, Rhode Island. Cushing, in behavior that was similar to that of other merchants involved in military supply, used these positions to substantially enrich the family merchant business by granting it favorably priced supply contracts. He was also involved in regional conventions that attempted to stem the inflationary decline in value of the Continental dollar by setting wage and price controls; these attempts failed because states refused to implement convention recommendations.

In 1778 Cushing was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to create a new constitution for the state. This effort was rejected by the state&#x27;s eligible voters for a variety of reason, although there continued to be calls from the towns demanding a new constitution. Cushing was not involved in the detailed drafting of the state constitution that was adopted in 1780. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1780).

===President of the Massachusetts Senate===
Cushing was elected to the Massachusetts Senate the 1780 election. As several districts failed to elect senators and several others refused to serve, there were only nineteen senators sworn in for the first Senate session of 1780. On October 25, 1780, of the nineteen senators who had been sworn in, fourteen voted for Cushing, and Cushing was elected the first President of the Massachusetts Senate. Cushing resigned as president on November 4, 1780, in order to become the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts.

===Lieutenant governor===
Cushing stood for election as lieutenant governor in the 1780 election. The vote was indecisive (no candidate received a majority of the votes cast), and the choice was given to the General Court to decide. Its first candidate, James Bowdoin, refused the post, as did the second choice, James Warren, and the choice went to Cushing on the third ballot. He then served in the post, most of the time serving under his friend John Hancock, until his death in 1788. In early 1785, Hancock offered his resignation to the legislature, partly as a political maneuver (although he claimed to be suffering a particularly bad case of gout at the time). The legislature did not insist that Hancock remain in office, resulting in Hancock actually resigning. Cushing became acting governor and served out the last few months of the term. The 1785 election for governor was highly political and divisive; Cushing was portrayed by his opponents (principally Bowdoin and his supporters) as little more than a creature of Hancock who would do Hancock&#x27;s bidding. The election was again undecided by the electorate; Bowdoin prevailed in the General Court&#x27;s decision-making, and Cushing again won the lieutenant governor&#x27;s office. Bowdoin served two terms, which were dominated by Shays&#x27; Rebellion, an uprising caused in part by Bowdoin&#x27;s harsh fiscal policies and poor economic conditions in the rural parts of the state. In 1787, Hancock returned to politics, trouncing Bowdoin. In each of these elections Cushing was re-elected as lieutenant governor.

During their time in office Hancock and Cushing funded the rebuilding of Boston, which had been devastated by the British occupation in 1775–76. Although Hancock was given most of the credit for this effort, it is known that Cushing played a significant role in the rebuilding effort.

==Death and legacy==
Thomas Cushing died in Boston on February 28, 1788, while serving as lieutenant governor. He was buried in Boston&#x27;s Granary Burying Ground. Cushing, Maine, is named in his honor.

<doc id="627476" wikidata="Q624043" url="?curid=627476" title="Udder">
<text>An udder is an organ formed of two or four mammary glands on the females of dairy animals and ruminants such as cattle, goats, and sheep. An udder is equivalent to the breast in primates, elephantine pachyderms and other mammals. The udder is a single mass hanging beneath the animal, consisting of pairs of mammary glands with protruding teats. In cattle, camels and deer, there are normally two pairs, in sheep and goats, there is one pair, and in some animals, there are many pairs. In animals with udders, the mammary glands develop on the milk line near the groin. Mammary glands that develop on the chest (such as in primates and elephants) are generally referred to as breasts.

Udder care and hygiene in cows is important in milking, aiding uninterrupted and untainted milk production, and preventing mastitis. Products exist to soothe the chapped skin of the udder. This helps prevent bacterial infection, and reduces irritation during milking by the cups, and so the cow is less likely to kick the cups off. It has been demonstrated that incorporating nutritional supplements into diet, including vitamin E, is an additional method of improving udder health and reducing infection.

== Etymology ==
Udder has been attested in Middle English as or (also as , ), and in Old English as . It was evolved from the Proto-Germanic reconstructed root &quot;*eudrą&quot; or &quot;*ūdrą&quot;, which in turn descended from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h₁ówHdʰr̥&quot; (“udder”). It is cognate with Saterland Frisian (“udder”), Dutch (“udder”), German (“udder”), Swedish (“udder”), Icelandic (“udder”), Vedic Sanskrit ऊधर् (ū́dhar), Ancient Greek (), and Latin .

== As food ==
The udder, or &quot;elder&quot; in Ireland, Scotland and northern England, of a slaughtered cow was in times past prepared and consumed. In other countries, like Italy, parts of Pakistan, and some South American countries, cow udder is still consumed in dishes like the traditional and ubres asada.

<text>Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is an approach to enhanced communication, understanding, and connection based on the principles of nonviolence and humanistic psychology. It is not an attempt to end disagreements, but rather a way that aims to increase empathy and understanding to improve the overall quality of life. It seeks empathic dialogue and understanding among all parties. Nonviolent Communication evolved from concepts used in person-centered therapy, and was developed by clinical psychologist Marshall Rosenberg beginning in the 1960s and 1970s. There are a large number of workshops and clinical materials about NVC, including Rosenberg&#x27;s book &quot;Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life&quot;. Marshall Rosenberg also taught NVC in a number of video lectures available online; the workshop recorded in San Francisco is the most well-known.

NVC is a communication tool with the goal of first creating empathy in the conversation. The idea is that once people hear one another, it will be much easier to talk about a solution which satisfies all parties&#x27; fundamental needs. The goal is interpersonal harmony and obtaining knowledge for future cooperation. Notable concepts include rejecting coercive forms of discourse, gathering facts through observing without evaluating, genuinely and concretely expressing feelings and needs, and formulating effective and empathetic requests. Nonviolent Communication is used as a clinical psychotherapy modality and it is also offered in workshops for the general public, particularly in regard to seeking harmony in relationships and at workplaces.

==History==
Marshall Rosenberg&#x27;s motivation for developing NVC was based on his own experiences at the Detroit race riot of 1943, as well as the antisemitism that he experienced in his early life. 
According to Marion Little (2008), the roots of the NVC model developed in the late 1960s, when Rosenberg was working on racial integration in schools and organizations in the Southern United States. The earliest version of the model (observations, feelings, needs, and action-oriented wants) was part of a training manual Rosenberg prepared in 1972.

The development of NVC is highly reliant on concepts developed by Carl Rogers and person-centered therapy. Rogers emphasized: 1) experiential learning, 2) &quot;frankness about one&#x27;s emotional state,&quot; 3) the satisfaction of hearing others &quot;in a way that resonates for them,&quot; 4) the enriching and encouraging experience of &quot;creative, active, sensitive, accurate, empathic listening,&quot; 5) the &quot;deep value of congruence between one&#x27;s own inner experience, one&#x27;s conscious awareness, and one&#x27;s communication,&quot; and, subsequently, 6) the enlivening experience of unconditionally receiving love or appreciation and extending the same. These influenced the concepts described in the section below.

Rosenberg was influenced by Erich Fromm, George Albee, and George Miller to adopt a community focus in his work, moving away from clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the social structure of a community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human behavior will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).

Rosenberg&#x27;s early work with children with learning disabilities shows his interest in psycholinguistics and the power of language, as well as his emphasis on collaboration. In its initial development, the NVC model re-structured the pupil-teacher relationship to give students greater responsibility for, and decision-making related to, their own learning. The model has evolved over the years to incorporate institutional power relationships (i.e., police-citizen, boss-employee) and informal ones (i.e. man-woman, rich-poor, adult-youth, parent-child). The ultimate aim is to develop societal relationships based on a restorative, &quot;partnership&quot; paradigm and mutual respect, rather than a retributive, fear-based, &quot;domination&quot; paradigm.

In order to show the differences between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal as a symbol of aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers&#x27; reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals in order to make the differences in communication clearer to the audience.

The model had evolved to its present form (observations, feelings, needs and requests) by 1992. Since the late 2000s, there has been more emphasis on &quot;self-empathy&quot; as a key to the model&#x27;s effectiveness. Another shift in emphasis, since 2000, has been the reference to the model as a &quot;process&quot;. The focus is thus less on the &quot;steps&quot; themselves and more on the practitioner&#x27;s &quot;intentions&quot; in speaking (&quot;Is the intent to get others to do what one wants, or to foster more meaningful relationships and mutual satisfaction?&quot;) in listening (&quot;Is the intent to prepare for what one has to say, or to extend heartfelt, respectful attentiveness to another?&quot;) and the quality of connection experienced with others.

In 2019, a group of certified NVC trainers published a #MeToo statement honouring Marshall Rosenberg&#x27;s legacy but also acknowledging he had slept with students at some times of his life. The trainers encourage all facilitators to share a warning with prospective clients and students about the potential risks of empathy work and recommended sexual boundaries.

==Overview==

Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. These &quot;violent&quot; modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

===Alternative names===
In a recorded lecture, Marshall Rosenberg describes the origins of the name Nonviolent Communication. He explains that the name was chosen to connect his work to the word &quot;nonviolence&quot; that was used by the peace movement, thus showing the ambition to create peace on the planet. Meanwhile, Marshall did not like that name since it described what NVC is not, rather than what NVC is. In fact, this goes against an important principle in the fourth component of NVC, i.e. requests. Specifically, in an NVC request, one should ask for what one does want, not what one doesn&#x27;t want. Because of this, a number of alternative names have become common, most importantly giraffe language, compassionate communication or collaborative communication.

===Components===
There are four components to practice nonviolent communication, and in this order:

#Observation: These are facts (what we are seeing, hearing, or touching) as distinct from our evaluation of meaning and significance. NVC discourages static generalizations. It is said that &quot;When we combine observation with evaluation, others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying.&quot; Instead, a focus on observations specific to time and context is recommended.
#Feelings: These are emotions or sensations, free of thought and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., &quot;I feel I didn&#x27;t get a fair deal&quot;) and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what we think we are (e.g., &quot;inadequate&quot;), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., &quot;unimportant&quot;), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., &quot;misunderstood&quot;, &quot;ignored&quot;). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and &quot;Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts.&quot;
#Needs: These are universal human needs, as distinct from particular strategies for meeting needs. It is posited that &quot;Everything we do is in service of our needs.&quot; Marshall Rosenberg refers to Max-Neef&#x27;s model where needs may be categorised into 9 classes: sustenance, safety, love, understanding/empathy, creativity, recreation, sense of belonging, autonomy and meaning. For more information, the Center for Nonviolent Communication has developed a &quot;needs inventory&quot;.
#Requests: Requests are distinguished from demands in that one is open to hearing a response of &quot;no&quot; without this triggering an attempt to force the matter. If one makes a request and receives a &quot;no&quot; it is not recommended that one gives up, but that one empathizes with what is preventing the other person from saying &quot;yes,&quot; before deciding how to continue the conversation. It is recommended that requests use clear, positive, concrete action language.

===Modes===
There are three primary modes of application of NVC:
*Self-empathy involves compassionately connecting with what is going on inside us. This may involve, without blame, noticing the thoughts and judgments we are having, noticing our feelings, and most critically, connecting to the needs that are affecting us.
*Receiving empathically, in NVC, involves &quot;connection with what&#x27;s alive in the other person and what would make life wonderful for them... It&#x27;s not an understanding of the head where we just mentally understand what another person says... Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that&#x27;s alive in them... It doesn&#x27;t mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That&#x27;s sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset. It doesn&#x27;t mean we have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you&#x27;re mentally trying to understand the other person, you&#x27;re not present with them.&quot; Empathy involves &quot;emptying the mind and listening with our whole being.&quot; NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.
*Expressing honestly, in NVC, is likely to involve expressing an observation, feeling, need, and request. An observation may be omitted if the context of the conversation is clear. A feeling might be omitted if there is sufficient connection already, or the context is one where naming a feeling isn&#x27;t likely to contribute to connection. It is said that naming a need in addition to a feeling makes it less likely that people will think you are making them responsible for your feeling. Similarly, it is said that making a request in addition to naming a need makes it less likely that people will infer a vague demand that they address your need. The components are thought to work together synergistically. According to NVC trainer Bob Wentworth, &quot;an observation sets the context, feelings support connection and getting out of our heads, needs support connection and identify what is important, and a request clarifies what sort of response you might enjoy. Using these components together minimizes the chances of people getting lost in potentially disconnecting speculation about what you want from them and why.&quot;

==Research==
A systematic review of research as of 2013 analyzed 13 studies picked from 2,634 citations. Two of these studies came from peer-reviewed journals. Eleven of these suggested an increase in empathy subsequent to the application of NVC (five of these with evidence of statistical significance) and two did not. There have been no randomized studies into NVC. Academic research into NVC only began in the 1990s, and has been increasing with time.

As of 2017, fifteen master&#x27;s theses and doctoral dissertations are known to have tested the model on sample sizes of 108 or smaller and generally have found the model to be effective.

While it is widely applied in clinical and lay contexts, and very limited research generally shows the technique to be effective in conflict resolution and increasing empathy, psychologists generally do not consider it to have the same standing as evidence-based practices such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. This is due to the low amount of academic research on the method.

Allan Rohlfs, who first met Rosenberg in 1972 and was a founder of the Center for Nonviolent Communication, in 2011 explained a paucity of academic literature as follows:
Virtually all conflict resolution programs have an academic setting as their foundation and therefore have empirical studies by graduate students assessing their efficacy. NVC is remarkable for its roots. Marshall Rosenberg, Ph.D. (clinical psychology, U of Wisconsin) comes from a full time private practice in clinical psychology and consultation, never an academic post. NVC, his creation, is entirely a grassroots organization and never had until recently any foundation nor grant monies, on the contrary funded 100% from trainings which were offered in public workshops around the world. ... Empirical data is now coming slowly as independent researchers find their own funding to conduct and publish empirical studies with peer review.

Bowers and Moffett (2012) asserts that NVC has been absent from academic programs due to a lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results.

Connor and Wentworth (2012) examined the impact of 6-months of NVC training and coaching on 23 executives in a Fortune 100 corporation. A variety of benefits were reported, including &quot;conversations and meetings were notably more efficient, with issues being resolved in 50-80 percent less time.&quot;

A 2014 study examined the effects of combined NVC and mindfulness training on 885 male inmates of the Monroe Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washington. The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease anger, and lead to abilities to take responsibility for one&#x27;s feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.

==Relationship to spirituality==
In the introduction to Rosenberg&#x27;s book &quot;Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life&quot;, 

NVC is described as a framework of several pre-existing concepts, that Rosenberg found useful on the topic of communication and conflict resolution. Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that some Christians have found NVC to be complementary to their Christian faith. Many people have found Nonviolent Communication to be very complementary to Buddhism, both in theory and in manifesting Buddhist ideals in practice. Furthermore, the &quot;NVC consciousness&quot; described in NVC have several similarities to the concepts of presence and patience in mindfulness. 

As Theresa Latini notes, &quot;Rosenberg understands NVC to be a fundamentally spiritual practice.&quot; Marshall Rosenberg describes the influence of his spiritual life on the development and practice of NVC:

I think it is important that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It&#x27;s really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don&#x27;t mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren&#x27;t able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it&#x27;s more than a communication process and realize it&#x27;s really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.

Rosenberg further states that he developed NVC as a way to &quot;get conscious of&quot; what he calls the &quot;Beloved Divine Energy&quot;. Rosenberg considered NVC to be much more than a four-step process for communication, but rather a way of living.

==Relationship to other models==
Marion Little examines theoretical frameworks related to NVC. The influential interest-based model for conflict resolution, negotiation, and mediation developed by Fisher, Ury, and Patton at the Harvard Negotiation Project and at the Program on Negotiation in the 1980s appears to have some conceptual overlap with NVC, although neither model references the other. Little suggests The Gordon Model for Effective Relationships (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based negotiation, based on conceptual similarities, if not any direct evidence of a connection. Like Rosenberg, Gordon had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models&#x27; similarities may reflect common influences.

Suzanne Jones sees a substantive difference between active listening as originated by Gordon and empathic listening as recommended by Rosenberg, insofar as active listening involves a specific step of reflecting what a speaker said to let them know you are listening, whereas empathic listening involves an ongoing process of listening with both heart and mind and being fully present to the other&#x27;s experience, with an aim of comprehending and empathizing with the needs of the other, the meaning of the experience for that person.

Gert Danielsen and Havva Kök both note an overlap between the premises of NVC and those of Human Needs Theory (HNT), an academic model for understanding the sources of conflict and designing conflict resolution processes, with the idea that &quot;Violence occurs when certain individuals or groups do not see any other way to meet their need, or when they need understanding, respect and consideration for their needs.&quot;

Chapman Flack sees an overlap between what Rosenberg advocates and critical thinking, especially Bertrand Russell&#x27;s formulation uniting kindness and clear thinking.

Martha Lasley sees similarities with the Focused Conversation Method developed by the Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA), with NVC&#x27;s &quot;observations&quot;, &quot;feelings&quot;, &quot;needs&quot;, and &quot;requests&quot; components relating to FCM&#x27;s &quot;objective&quot;, &quot;reflective&quot;, &quot;interpretive&quot;, and &quot;decisional&quot; stages.

==Applications==
NVC has been applied in organizational and business settings, in parenting, in education, in mediation, in psychotherapy, in healthcare, in addressing eating issues, in justice, and as a basis for a children&#x27;s book, among other contexts.

Rosenberg related ways he used Nonviolent Communication in peace programs in conflict zones including Rwanda, Burundi, Nigeria, Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Serbia, Croatia, Ireland, and the Middle East including the occupied West Bank.

Reportedly, one of the first acts of Satya Nadella when he became CEO of Microsoft in 2014 was to ask top company executives to read Rosenberg&#x27;s book, &quot;Nonviolent Communication.&quot;

==Criticisms==
Several researchers have attempted a thorough evaluation of criticisms and weaknesses of NVC and assessed significant challenges in its application. These span a range of potential problems, from the practical to the theoretical, and include concerns gathered from study participants and researchers.

The difficulty of using NVC as well as the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau and Flack find a paradoxical potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use. Bitschnau further suggests that the use of NVC is unlikely to allow everyone to express their feelings and have their needs met in real life as this would require inordinate time, patience and discipline. Those who are skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against those who are not and prefer to converse only among themselves.

Furthermore, the exclusivity of NVC appears to favor the well-educated, valuing those with more awareness of grammar, word choice, and syntax. This could lead to problems of accessibility for the underprivileged and favoring a higher social class.

Oboth suggests that people might hide their feelings in the process of empathy, subverting the nonviolence of communication.

Though intended to strengthen relationships between loved ones, NVC may lead to the outcome of an ended relationship. We are finite creatures with finite resources, and understanding one another&#x27;s needs through NVC may teach that the relationship causes too much strain to meet all needs.

The massive investment of time and effort in learning to use NVC has been noted by a number of researchers.

Chapman Flack, in reviewing a training video by Rosenberg, finds the presentation of key ideas &quot;spell-binding&quot; and the anecdotes &quot;humbling and inspiring&quot;, notes the &quot;beauty of his work&quot;, and his &quot;adroitly doing fine attentive thinking&quot; when interacting with his audience. Yet Flack wonders what to make of aspects of Rosenberg&#x27;s presentation, such as his apparent &quot;dim view of the place for thinking&quot; and his building on Walter Wink&#x27;s account of the origins of our way of thinking. To Flack, some elements of what Rosenberg says seem like pat answers at odds with the challenging and complex picture of human nature, history, literature, and art offer.

Flack notes a distinction between the &quot;strong sense&quot; of Nonviolent Communication as a virtue that is possible with care and attention, and the &quot;weak sense,&quot; a mimicry of this born of ego and haste. The strong sense offers a language to examine one&#x27;s thinking and actions, support understanding, bring one&#x27;s best to the community, and honor one&#x27;s emotions. In the weak sense, one may take the language as rules and use these to score debating points, label others for political gain, or insist that others express themselves in this way. Though concerned that some of what Rosenberg says could lead to the weak sense, Flack sees evidence confirming that Rosenberg understands the strong sense in practice. Rosenberg&#x27;s work with workshop attendees demonstrates &quot;the real thing.&quot; Yet Flack warns that &quot;the temptation of the weak sense will not be absent.&quot; As an antidote, Flack advises, &quot;Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others,&quot; (also known as the robustness principle) and guard against the &quot;metamorphosis of nonviolent communication into subtle violence done in its name.&quot;

Ellen Gorsevski, assessing Rosenberg&#x27;s book, &quot;Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Compassion&quot; (1999) in the context of geopolitical rhetoric, states that &quot;the relative strength of the individual is vastly overestimated while the key issue of structural violence is almost completely ignored.&quot;

PuddleDancer Press reports that NVC has been endorsed by a variety of public figures.

Sven Hartenstein has created a series of cartoons spoofing NVC.

While a number of studies have indicated a high degree of effectiveness, there has been limited academic research into NVC in general. From an evidence-based standpoint, it does not have the same standing as practices such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Supporters of the theory have generally relied on clinical and anecdotal experience to support its efficacy. Critics generally assume the efficacy of the method on an individual level; most criticism consider issues of equity and consistency. In Internet blog posts, some have described its model as self-contradictory, viewing NVC as a potentially coercive (and thus “violent”) technique with significant potential for misuse. The method requires a substantial amount of effort (time) to learn and apply, and assumes a certain level of education.

==Organizations==
The Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC), founded by Marshall Rosenberg, has trademarked the terms &quot;Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life&quot;, &quot;The Center for Nonviolent Communication&quot; and &quot;CNVC&quot;.

CNVC certifies trainers who wish to teach NVC in a manner aligned with CNVC&#x27;s understanding of the NVC process. CNVC also offers trainings by certified trainers.

Some trainings in Nonviolent Communication are offered by trainers sponsored by organizations considered as allied with, but having no formal relationship with, the Center for Nonviolent Communication founded by Marshall Rosenberg. Some of these trainings are announced through CNVC. Numerous NVC organizations have sprung up around the world, many with regional focuses.

<doc id="627500" wikidata="Q1480152" url="?curid=627500" title="Swiss French">
<text>Swiss French ( or &quot;&quot;) is the variety of French spoken in the French-speaking area of Switzerland known as Romandy. French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland, the others being German, Italian, and Romansch. In 2020 around 2 million people, or 22.8% of the population, in Switzerland spoke French as their primary language, and 28% of the population used French most often at work.


The French spoken in Switzerland is very similar to that of France or Belgium. The differences between the French of Switzerland and of France are mostly lexical, influenced by local substrate languages. While substantial phonological differences exist, as the French of Switzerland preserves many distinctions lost elsewhere, the phonetic qualities are often quite close, such as with the existence of long vowels or the distinction between /ɛ̃/ and /œ̃/. This contrasts with the differences between Standard German and Swiss German, which are largely mutually unintelligible.

Swiss French is characterized by some terms adopted from Arpitan, which was formerly spoken widely across the alpine communities of Romandy, but has far fewer speakers today. In addition, some expressions have been borrowed from both Swiss and Standard German. Although a standard form of French is taught in schools and used in the government, the media and business, there is no uniform vernacular form of French among the different cantons of Switzerland. For example, some German terms in regions bordering German-speaking communities are completely unused in the area around Geneva, a city by France&#x27;s border with Switzerland.

==Phonology==


*The nasal vowels are pronounced like in France. → , → , → . Conversely, the nasal vowels and are kept separate in much Swiss French speech, where much speech in France has merged them. For example, (stalk) and (brown) are still pronounced differently, like in Quebec and Belgium, unlike in Paris.
*As in Belgium, the distinction between the vowels and is maintained in Switzerland, but they have merged in France. For example, (put) and (master) are still pronounced differently, unlike in France.
*The distinction between mid vowels and has also been maintained in final open syllables, as well as that between and . For example, (skin) and (jar) are still pronounced differently, unlike in France and Quebec. For that reason, (entered; past participle of the verb ) and (third-person singular of in the imperfect indicative) are differentiated, just like in Standard French.
*There is a stronger distinction between long and short vowels in Switzerland:
** Long vowels are allowed in open syllables, even at the end of a word: , , , , and . As a result, almost all feminine adjectives are still phonetically distinct from their masculine counterparts, unlike in France and Quebec.
** Speakers also differentiate masculine from feminine adjectives phonetically, including in final closed syllables, although the spelling only partially bears out this occurrence, e.g. is pronounced , whilst the feminine is pronounced . Other minimal pairs are similarly differentiated, like and (third-person singular in the present indicative of , to lead).
** The marginal phoneme is usually pronounced , meaning (paws) and (pasta) are differentiated. Similar to the process described above, the circumflex also affects vowel length when used above a vowel, meaning is pronounced , as , as , as and .

<doc id="627501" wikidata="Q6653177" url="?curid=627501" title="Littlewood conjecture">
<text>In mathematics, the Littlewood conjecture is an open problem () in Diophantine approximation, proposed by John Edensor Littlewood around 1930. It states that for any two real numbers α and β,

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the distance to the nearest integer.

==Formulation and explanation==

This means the following: take a point (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) in the plane, and then consider the sequence of points

:(2&quot;α&quot;, 2&quot;β&quot;), (3&quot;α&quot;, 3&quot;β&quot;), ... .

For each of these, multiply the distance to the closest line with integer &quot;x&quot;-coordinate by the distance to the closest line with integer &quot;y&quot;-coordinate. This product will certainly be at most 1/4. The conjecture makes no statement about whether this sequence of values will converge; it typically does not, in fact. The conjecture states something about the limit inferior, and says that there is a subsequence for which the distances decay faster than the reciprocal, i.e.

:o(1/&quot;n&quot;)

in the little-o notation.

==Connection to further conjectures==

It is known that this would follow from a result in the geometry of numbers, about the minimum on a non-zero lattice point of a product of three linear forms in three real variables: the implication was shown in 1955 by Cassels and Swinnerton-Dyer. This can be formulated another way, in group-theoretic terms. There is now another conjecture, expected to hold for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3: it is stated in terms of &quot;G&quot; = &quot;SLn&quot;(&quot;R&quot;), Γ = &quot;SLn&quot;(&quot;Z&quot;), and the subgroup &quot;D&quot; of diagonal matrices in &quot;G&quot;.

Conjecture: for any &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;/Γ such that &quot;Dg&quot; is relatively compact (in &quot;G&quot;/Γ), then &quot;Dg&quot; is closed.

This in turn is a special case of a general conjecture of Margulis on Lie groups.

==Partial results==
Borel showed in 1909 that the exceptional set of real pairs (α,β) violating the statement of the conjecture is of Lebesgue measure zero. Manfred Einsiedler, Anatole Katok and Elon Lindenstrauss have shown that it must have Hausdorff dimension zero; and in fact is a union of countably many compact sets of box-counting dimension zero. The result was proved by using a measure classification theorem for diagonalizable actions of higher-rank groups, and an &quot;isolation theorem&quot; proved by Lindenstrauss and Barak Weiss.

These results imply that non-trivial pairs satisfying the conjecture exist: indeed, given a real number α such that formula_3, it is possible to construct an explicit β such that (α,β) satisfies the conjecture.

<text>Victoria Jackson (born August 2, 1959) is an American actress and comedian. She was a cast member on the series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1986 to 1992.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in Miami, Florida, the daughter of Marlene Esther (née Blackstad) and James McCaslin Jackson, a gym coach. From the age of 5 until she was 18, Jackson&#x27;s father trained her in gymnastics.

After graduating from high school, Jackson attended Florida Bible College in Hollywood, Florida, later transferring to Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina on a gymnastics scholarship. At Furman, she was cast in her first play. She transferred to Auburn University in 1979 for her senior year, changing her major to theater. Midway through her senior year, she left Auburn to pursue an acting career.

In the 2000s, Jackson earned a degree in theatre from Palm Beach Atlantic University.

==Acting and comedy==
While doing summer stock theater in Alabama, Jackson met former child actor Johnny Crawford of the 1950s television series &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, who cast her in his nightclub act. She moved to Los Angeles in 1981, working various day jobs and performing comedy at night. Her first big break was an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, where she recited poetry while doing a handstand. She went on to appear on the show 20 times. In 1984 she appeared in the pilot for &quot;W*A*L*T*E*R&quot;, a &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; spin-off that the networks did not pick up.

Following a role in the short-lived 1985 television series &quot;Half Nelson&quot;, Jackson received an offer to audition for the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Because she was not confident her audition had gone well, she performed several impersonations on her next &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance and sent the tape to &quot;SNL&quot;″s Lorne Michaels. After viewing the tape, Michaels asked Jackson to join the show. A regular cast member from 1986 to 1992, Jackson often appeared on the show&#x27;s weekly &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment as a correspondent who goes off topic, reciting poetry and doing backbends or handstands on the desk. She was also known for recurring skit roles where she impersonated Roseanne Barr, Sally Struthers and Zsa Zsa Gabor.

During her tenure on &quot;SNL&quot;, Jackson was cast in a number of films, including &quot;Baby Boom&quot;, &quot;Family Business&quot;, &quot;I Love You to Death&quot;, &quot;UHF&quot;, &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot;, &quot;The Couch Trip&quot;, and &quot;Casual Sex?&quot;. Her film career continued after her 1992 departure from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but mostly in unknown or unnoticed films. On television, she was cast as the lead of her own sitcom, co-starring George Clooney. When there was a change in management at Fox, the show was scrapped without being broadcast. In 1994, she appeared as &quot;Beverly&quot; in the &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; episode &quot;Good Cop, Bad Cop&quot;, and in 1999 she appeared as the unrequited love of a small-town man who can control the weather in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;The Rain King&quot;.

Jackson had a regular role as Patty in the 2000–2001 Comedy Central sitcom &quot;Strip Mall&quot; and in the 2003–2004 seasons of the Nickelodeon show &quot;Romeo!&quot;. In 2004 and 2005, she had roles in two romantic comedies, &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me!&quot; and &quot;Her Minor Thing&quot;. During this period, Jackson appeared on the game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and participated in the show &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;. She played multiple characters in the 2014 direct-to-video movie &quot;Campin&#x27; Buddies&quot;.

==Political views==

A self-described conservative Christian, Jackson has appeared in productions such as the 2007 Christian comedy concert &quot;Thou Shalt Laugh 2: The Deuce&quot; as well as a dozen times on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; with Bill Maher. She has supported the Tea Party movement through appearances at events as well as her website, which was affiliated with the Liberty Alliance.

In October 2008, she appeared with other celebrities on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; in a National Republican Senatorial Committee advertisement poking fun at Al Franken, a fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus then running for the United States Senate from Minnesota.

Beginning in 2008, Jackson stated that she believed Barack Obama to be a communist. In 2015, she claimed that Obama was an &quot;Islamic jihadist&quot; and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, with members of the organization in his cabinet, and that Obama&#x27;s support for legal abortion and same-sex marriage showed he was not a Christian.

In 2011, Jackson criticized the TV show &quot;Glee&quot; for showing a kiss between two male actors, citing the Bible to justify her criticism. When accused of homophobia, Jackson countered that the label was merely a &quot;cute liberal buzzword&quot; and suggested that &quot;Glee&quot; be replaced with a show promoting celibacy.

In 2011, Jackson joined the staff of &quot;Patriot Update&quot; as a writer and video blogger and host of the talk show &quot;Politichicks&quot;. Co-hosts included Ann-Marie Murrell, Jannique Stewart, and Jennie Jones. Jackson wrote a satirical song for &quot;Politichicks&quot; titled &quot;Shariah Law&quot;, with the song&#x27;s lyrics claiming, &quot;They [Muslims] like beheadings and pedophile weddings&quot;. Among her work for Patriot Update was a piece on Occupy Wall Street that was critical of the protesters.

In 2012, White Hall publishers, part of the Liberty Alliance, released Jackson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Is My Bow Too Big? How I Went from Saturday Night Live to the Tea Party&quot;.

In 2012, after Todd Akin&#x27;s remarks regarding pregnancies resulting from rape, Jackson said &quot;If I got raped, I would have the baby. And if I didn&#x27;t want to keep it because I had these horrible nightmares, I would adopt it out. But I think that God can turn a bad thing into a good thing, and that if I got raped and a beautiful baby who was innocent was born out of it, that would be a blessing.&quot;

In 2014, Jackson filed a petition as an independent candidate for one of two District 2 seats in Williamson County, Tennessee. She received 632 votes, not enough to secure either seat against the incumbent candidates.

In 2023, Jackson objected to Franklin, Tennessee, holding a gay pride parade.

==Personal life==
Jackson married a fellow performer, fire-eating magician Nisan Mark Eventoff, in 1984, and had a daughter. They divorced in 1991. Shortly thereafter, she reconnected with her high school sweetheart, Paul Wessel, then a Miami-Dade SWAT team police officer, and they married and had a daughter. When her husband retired in 2013, the couple moved to Nashville, Tennessee. Jackson was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. She announced through an Instagram post in August 2024 that her breast cancer had metastasized and she had been diagnosed with an inoperable tumor in her windpipe.

<doc id="627536" wikidata="Q694752" url="?curid=627536" title="False imprisonment">
<text>False imprisonment or unlawful imprisonment occurs when a person intentionally restricts another person&#x27;s movement within any area without legal authority, justification, or the restrained person&#x27;s permission. Actual physical restraint is not necessary for false imprisonment to occur. A false imprisonment claim may be made based upon private acts, or upon wrongful governmental detention. For detention by the police, proof of false imprisonment provides a basis to obtain a writ of habeas corpus.

Under common law, false imprisonment is both a crime and a tort.

==Imprisonment==

Within the context of false imprisonment, an imprisonment occurs when a person is restrained from moving from a location or bounded area, as a result of a wrongful intentional act, such as the use of force, threat, coercion, or abuse of authority.

==Detention that is not false imprisonment==
Not all acts of involuntary detention amount to false imprisonment. An accidental detention will not support a claim of false imprisonment since false imprisonment requires an intentional act. The law may privilege a person to detain somebody else against their will. A legally authorised detention does not constitute false imprisonment. For example, if a parent or legal guardian of a child denies the child&#x27;s request to leave their house, and prevents them from doing so, this would not ordinarily constitute false imprisonment.

==By country==

===United States===

Under United States law, police officers have the authority to detain individuals based on probable cause that a crime has been committed and the individual was involved, or based on reasonable suspicion that the individual has been, is, or is about to be engaged in a criminal activity.

====Elements====
To prevail under a false imprisonment claim, a plaintiff must prove:
# Willful detention in a bounded area
# Without consent; and
# Without authority of lawful arrest. (Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts)

====Shopkeeper&#x27;s privilege====
Many jurisdictions in the United States recognize the common-law principle of shopkeeper&#x27;s privilege, under which a person is allowed to use reasonable force to detain a suspected shoplifter on store property for a reasonable period of time. A shopkeeper, who has cause to believe that the detainee has committed or attempted a theft of store property, is allowed to ask the suspect to demonstrate that they have not been shoplifting. The purpose of the shopkeeper&#x27;s privilege is to discover if the suspect is shoplifting and, if so, whether the shoplifted item can be reclaimed.

The shopkeeper&#x27;s privilege is not as broad as police officer&#x27;s privilege to arrest. The shopkeeper may only detain the suspect for a comparatively short period of time. If a shopkeeper unreasonably detains the suspect, uses excessive force to detain the suspect, or fails to notify the police within a reasonable time after detaining the suspect, then the detention may constitute false imprisonment and may result in an award of damages. In jurisdictions without the privilege, detention must meet the jurisdiction&#x27;s standards for a citizen&#x27;s arrest.

=====Rationale=====
This privilege has been justified by the very practical need for some degree of protection for shopkeepers in their dealings with suspected shoplifters. Absent such privilege, a shopkeeper would be faced with the dilemma of either allowing suspects to leave without challenge or acting upon their suspicion and risk making a false arrest.

=====Requirement=====
In order for a customer to be detained, the shopkeeper must:
# Conduct the investigation on the store premises, or immediately near the premises.
# Have reasonable cause to believe the person detained was shoplifting.
# Use reasonable (non-excessive) force to detain the suspected individual.
# Not prolong the detention longer than a reasonable amount of time needed to gather all the facts.

====Examples====

=====Colorado=====
In &quot;Enright v. Groves&quot;, a woman sued a police officer for false imprisonment after being arrested for not producing her driver&#x27;s license. The plaintiff was in her car when she was approached by the officer for not leashing her dog; she was arrested after being asked to produce her driver&#x27;s license and failing to do so. She won her claim, despite having lost the case of not leashing her dog. The court reasoned that the officer did not have proper legal authority in arresting her, because he arrested her for not producing her driver&#x27;s license (which itself was legal) as opposed to the dog leash violation.

=====Indiana=====
In a Clark County, Indiana Circuit Court case, Destiny Hoffman was jailed for 154 days, during which &quot;no hearing was conducted to determine the validity of such sanction and the defendant was not represented by counsel&quot; according to deputy county prosecutor Michaelia Gilbert. An order by Judge Jerry Jacobi in the Clark County Circuit Court case was supposed to be a 48-hour jail stay for Hoffman, pending drug evaluation and treatment, &quot;until further order of the court.&quot; After a motion by Prosecutor Gilbert, Special Judge Steve Fleece ordered Hoffman released and said Hoffman&#x27;s incarceration was &quot;a big screw up&quot;.

=====Louisiana=====
In a Louisiana case in the United States, a pharmacist and his pharmacy were found liable by a trial court for false imprisonment. They stalled for time and instructed a patient to wait while simultaneously and without the patient&#x27;s knowledge calling the police. The pharmacist was suspicious of the patient&#x27;s prescription, which her doctor had called in previously. When the police arrived, they arrested the patient. While the patient was in jail, the police verified with her doctor that the prescription was authentic and that it was meant for her. After this incident, the patient sued the pharmacy and its employees. She received $20,000 damages. An appeals court reversed the judgment, because it believed the elements of false imprisonment were not met.

===United Kingdom===
This tort again falls under the umbrella term &quot;trespass to the person&quot; alongside &quot;battery and assault&quot;. The definition of false imprisonment under UK law and legislation is the &quot;Unlawful imposition or constraint of another&#x27;s freedom of movement from a particular place.&quot; False imprisonment is where the defendant intentionally or recklessly, and unlawfully, restricts the claimant&#x27;s freedom of movement totally. During which there is no time limit, false imprisonment could occur for seconds and still be false imprisonment.

====Elements====

===== Intentional or reckless =====
An example of reckless imprisonment may be a janitor locking up a school for the night, knowing that someone &quot;might&quot; still be inside, but without bothering to check. Whereas, regarding intention, intention to imprison a person is what matters and not necessarily an intention to falsely imprison someone. For example, in &quot;R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, ex p Evans&quot;, it did not matter if the decision to imprison the claimant was in good faith, or considered lawful, it still constituted false imprisonment.

False imprisonment does not require a literal prison, but a restriction of the claimant&#x27;s freedom of movement (&quot;complete restraint&quot;). According to the &quot;Termes de la Ley&quot;, &#x27;imprisonment is the restraint of a man&#x27;s liberty, whether it be in the open field, or in the stocks, or in the cage in the streets or in a man&#x27;s own house, as well as in the common gaole&#x27;. Imprisonment does not have to involve seizure of the claimant; touching and informing him that he is under arrest are sufficient. Tagging and an imposed curfew can be false imprisonment. The restriction must also be total, meaning that the claimant is restricted to an area delimited by the defendant. The larger the area, the less likely the claimant will be deemed to be imprisoned. For example, confining a person to a house would constitute the tort of false imprisonment. However, confining someone to the land mass of the USA would not.

Therefore, false imprisonment is not just about locking someone within a room, the following examples have all been found to constitute false imprisonment:

* Where a defendant might position themselves in a doorway to prevent someone leaving a room, as in &quot;Walker v Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis&quot; [2014].
* Where a defendant might threaten violence if the claimant leaves, which could thus be both false imprisonment and assault.
* Where a defendant ensures someone stays in a room simply by asserting their authority, as in &quot;Harnett v Bond&quot; and &quot;Meering v Grahame-White Aviation.&quot;

Finally, where a claimant accedes to authority that does not necessarily mean they consent to being detained, as in &quot;Warner v Riddiford&quot; (1858).

===== Complete restraint =====
&#x27;Imprisonment is, as I apprehend, a total restraint of the liberty of the person, for however, short a time, and not a partial obstruction of his will, whatever inconvenience it may bring on him.&#x27; There must be complete restraint, therefore, if there are alternative routes that can be taken this is not false imprisonment. Such as in &quot;Bird v Jones [1845]&quot; where the claimant wanted to walk over Hammersmith bridge but the defendant had cordoned off the public footpath, however, this did not constitute false imprisonment because, through using a longer route, the claimant could have still reached their destination.

Therefore, if there is a means of escape, this is not false imprisonment. There must be no reasonable means of escape and you may be compensated for any damages caused in order for you to escape reasonably. However, if you have not taken a reasonable route of escape/reasonable action you will not be awarded damages.

===== Awareness =====
It is still false imprisonment even where the claimant does not know at the time. So secretly locking someone in a room is false imprisonment. It may also be false imprisonment where a person is rendered unconscious, for example, by being punched (also a battery), or when their drink is spiked by drugs (also wilful harm or negligence), because their freedom of movement is thereby restricted. For example, in the case of &quot;Meering v Grahame-White Aviation [1918]&quot; the claimant was told to stay in an office because property was going missing and if they tried to leave the office they would have been stopped. This was held to be a false imprisonment even though the claimant did not know they were being imprisoned.

===== Omission =====
&quot;Can the tort of false imprisonment be committed by omission?&quot;

In the majority of circumstances/generally, the answer is no, as there must be a positive act. Yet, in certain circumstances defendants may still be found liable if they are under a positive obligation to release the claimant and the claimant has the legal right to be released. In the case of &quot;Prison Officer&#x27;s Association v Iqbal&quot; where a defendant could not leave their cell due to the prison officers being on strike, it was held at [61] that:

Thus, the defendants were liable for omission under the tort of false imprisonment.

Moreover, in the case of &quot;R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, ex p Evans&quot;, where the claimant should be released from prison and they weren&#x27;t, due to a genuine mistake meaning they were held in prison for longer, this was still held to be false imprisonment.

===== Lawful imprisonment =====

====== Performance of a contract ======
This can be looked at as consent, therefore, the imprisonment is not unlawful nor false imprisonment, for example, when flying, you consent to be on the plane for that duration of time through contract. The courts have said it is not unlawful to refuse to open a train door when the train is on a bridge, even though the passenger is thereby restricted inside the train. Likewise, a master of a ship, or the pilot of a plane can detain people during a voyage or flight when they have a reasonable cause or grounds to believe it necessary for the safety of their other passengers. Suddenly saying &quot;I would like to leave now&quot; is dangerous and thus, they have no reason to let you leave, moreover, you are contractually obligated to remain onboard. Therefore, this would not constitute false imprisonment.

Additionally, when a claimant is following a work contract the employer may not be held for false imprisonment for not allowing them to leave early due to a breach of contract and potential losses that could result from them leaving. In the case of &quot;Herd v Weardale Steel Coal&quot; where the claimant was in a mine, they were working and they wanted to leave the mine. The employer refused to let them leave at that time and the court held that the employer was under no obligation to allow them to do so.

====== Police ======
Under English law, police have the right to arrest under a warrant issued by a magistrate, and following conditions set out in PACE Code G. Or without a warrant, police may make an arrest pursuant to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984: &#x27;anyone who is about to commit, is committing or has committed an offence or is so suspected on reasonable grounds may be arrested.&#x27; Also, arrest may be lawful if the police have reason to believe that the person arrested poses an imminent risk of harm to themselves or others. Private citizens can also make an arrest for crimes being committed/that have been committed but only in relation to indictable offences (&#x27;citizen&#x27;s arrest&#x27;). When a prisoner is lawfully held, it is not false imprisonment just because the conditions are unsanitary such as in the case of &quot;R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison&quot;, &#x27;although this may instead be found to be negligence or the tort of misfeasance in a public office.&#x27;

Another example would again be the case of &quot;Austin v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis&quot; [2007], a case concerning the alleged unlawful detention of hundreds of members of the public during the May Day riots of 2001 in London, England. The police, using the tactic of &quot;kettling&quot;, held a large crowd in Oxford Circus without allowing anyone to leave. Lois Austin, a peaceful protester who had not broken the law, and Geoffrey Saxby, an innocent passer-by who was not involved in the demonstration, claimed that they were falsely imprisoned by the London Metropolitan Police and that their detention was in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights. The pair lost their court action in 2005, when the High Court ruled that the police had not acted unlawfully. An appeal against the ruling also failed in 2007. A ruling by the House of Lords declared that &#x27;even in the case of an absolute right, the High Court was entitled to take the &quot;purpose&quot; of the deprivation of liberty into account before deciding if human rights law applied at all.&#x27;

== Defences ==
Defences for false imprisonment include consent and performance of a contract. Moreover, the defence of illegality may also apply. If the victim was acting illegally, locking them in a room to protect oneself whilst calling the police is a legitimate defence. However, if the use of force or in this case imprisonment was unreasonable, this would not be a viable defence, as is shown in the case of &quot;Revil v Newbery&quot; where a homeowner fired a shotgun to the burglar and ended up injuring him, this was held to be an unreasonable use of force and thus, the defence of illegality was void.

== Damages ==
If the false imprisonment was for a minimal amount of time, the claimant could be entitled to nominal damages, as this tort is actionable &quot;per se&quot;. In &quot;Walker v Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis&quot; [2014] where someone was stopped in a doorway for a couple of seconds this was still held to be false imprisonment. Additionally, if the applicant was injured through trying to escape using reasonable methods they may be entitled to compensatory damages. When law enforcement authorities violate the fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution by detaining people without sufficient reason or disregarding due process, then it undermines the country&#x27;s judicial system. Such actions violate individuals&#x27; rights while gravely damaging public trust in the criminal justice process. Finally, if the claimant suffered an &#x27;affront to their dignity&#x27;, they may be awarded aggravated damages (these are very rare). For example, in the case of &quot;Hook v Cunard Steamship Co Ltd&quot; the sailor was confined to his quarters and accused of child molestation but with &#x27;no vestige of grounds in support&#x27;, this was held to be false imprisonment and aggravated damages were available due to this causing humiliation and injury to the claimant&#x27;s feelings.

<text>Cladonia rangiferina, also known as reindeer cup lichen, reindeer lichen (cf. Sw. &quot;renlav&quot;) or grey reindeer lichen, is a light-coloured fruticose, cup lichen species in the family Cladoniaceae. It grows in both hot and cold climates in well-drained, open environments. Found primarily in areas of alpine tundra, it is extremely cold-hardy.

Other common names include reindeer moss, deer moss, and caribou moss, but these names can be misleading since it is, though somewhat moss-like in appearance, not a moss. As the common names suggest, reindeer lichen is an important food for reindeer (caribou), and has economic importance as a result. Synonyms include &quot;Cladina rangiferina&quot; and &quot;Lichen rangiferinus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot; was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;; as was the custom at the time, he classified it in the eponymous genus, as &quot;Lichen rangiferinus&quot;. Friedrich Heinrich Wiggers transferred it to the genus &quot;Cladonia&quot; in 1780.

==Description==
Thalli are fruticose, and extensively branched, with each branch usually dividing into three or four (sometimes two); the thicker branches are typically in diameter. The colour is greyish, whitish or brownish grey. &quot;C. rangiferina&quot; forms extensive mats up to tall. The branching is at a smaller angle than that of &quot;Cladonia portentosa&quot;. It lacks a well-defined cortex (a protective layer covering the thallus, analogous to the epidermis in plants), but rather, a loose layer of hyphae cover the photobionts. The photobiont associated with the reindeer lichen is &quot;Trebouxia irregularis&quot;.

Reindeer lichen, like many lichens, is slow growing ( per year) and may take decades to return once overgrazed, burned, trampled, or otherwise damaged.

A similar-looking but distinct species, also known by the common name &quot;reindeer lichen&quot;, is &quot;Cladonia portentosa&quot;.

=== Chemistry ===
A variety of bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from &quot;C. rangiferina&quot;, including abietane, labdane, isopimarane, the abietane diterpenoids hanagokenols A and B, obtuanhydride, sugiol, 5,6-dehydrosugiol, montbretol, &quot;cis&quot;-communic acid, imbricatolic acid, 15-acetylimbricatoloic acid, junicedric acid, 7α-hydroxysandaracopimaric acid, β-resorylic acid, atronol, barbatic acid, homosekikaic acid, didymic acid and condidymic acid. Some of these compounds have mild inhibitory activities against methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and vancomycin-resistant &quot;Enterococci&quot;.
Exposure to UV-B radiation induces the accumulation of usnic acid and melanic compounds. Usnic acid is thought to play a role in protecting the photosymbiont by absorbing excess UV-B.

==Resynthesis==
Resynthesis experiments have been conducted to study the early stages of lichen formation in &quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot;. These experiments involve isolating and culturing the fungal and algal partners separately, then reuniting them under laboratory conditions to observe the process of lichenization. Through these studies, researchers have identified several key stages in the early development of the lichen thallus.

The first stage, known as the pre-contact stage, occurs around one day post co-inoculation. During this stage, no apparent fungal or algal growth is observed, and hyphal tips are not growing towards algal cells. By the eighth day post co-inoculation, the contact stage is reached. This stage is characterised by rich branching of fungal hyphae with short internodes. Hyphal tips grow towards algal cells, and some form swollen tips called appressoria upon contact. Hyphae can be observed growing around single algal cells or clusters, and mucilage is frequently present. The growth together stage is typically observed around 21 days post co-inoculation. At this point, coordinated growth between the fungus and alga becomes evident. Algal cells are integrated within a hyphal matrix, with hyphae emerging through algal colonies and forming networks within and between them.

Quantitative measurements during these stages reveal several patterns. In compatible interactions, researchers observe significantly shorter hyphal internode lengths and more lateral branches compared to incompatible ones. The frequency of appressoria formation increases over time in compatible interactions. There is no significant reduction in algal cell diameter in compatible interactions, unlike in some incompatible pairings. These experiments highlight the specificity of the &quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot; – &quot;Asterochloris glomerata&quot;/&quot;irregularis&quot; symbiosis. When paired with incompatible algae such as &quot;Coccomyxa peltigerae&quot; or &quot;Chloroidium ellipsoideum&quot;, &quot;C. rangiferina&quot; shows reduced growth and fewer symbiosis-specific morphological changes.

The resynthesis process in &quot;C. rangiferina&quot; appears to be slower compared to some other lichen species. Researchers have not observed a well-organised prethallus stage even after three months of co-cultivation. This may be due to specific environmental requirements or growth conditions needed for complete thallus formation in this species. These studies provide insights into the recognition mechanisms and early developmental processes involved in lichen formation. The observations support the concept of controlled parasitism in lichen symbiosis, where the fungal partner exhibits parasitic behavior, but in a controlled manner that allows for mutual benefit in the long term.

==Habitat==
&quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot; often dominates the ground in boreal pine forests and open, low-alpine sites in a wide range of habitats, from humid, open forests, rocks and heaths. It grows on humus, or on soil over rock. It is mainly found in the taiga and the tundra. A specific biome in which this lichen is represented is the boreal forests of Canada.

==Ecology==
In a Finnish study of the growth rate of &quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot;, it was found that the lichen grows from 3.9 to 4.4 mm per year, achieving the fastest growth rate in younger (less than 60 years), shadowy forests, and the slowest growth in an older (more than 180 years), thinned forest.

&quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot; is a known host to the lichenicolous fungus species &quot;Lichenopeltella rangiferinae&quot;, which is named after &quot;C. rangiferina&quot;, &quot;Lichenoconium pyxidatae&quot; and &quot;Lichenopeltella uncialicola&quot;

==Conservation==
In certain parts of its range, this lichen is an endangered species. For example, in the British Duchy of Cornwall it is protected under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.

==Uses==
The reindeer lichen is edible, but crunchy. It can be soaked with wood ashes to remove its bitterness, then added to milk or other dishes. It is a source of vitamin D.

This lichen can be used in the making of aquavit, and is sometimes used as decoration in glass windows. The lichen is used as a traditional remedy for removal of kidney stones by the Monpa in the alpine regions of the West Kameng district of Eastern Himalaya. The Inland Dena&#x27;ina used reindeer lichen for food by crushing the dry lichen and then boiling it or soaking it in hot water until it becomes soft. They eat it plain or, preferably, mixed with berries, fish eggs, or lard. The Inland Dena&#x27;ina also boil reindeer lichen and drink the juice as a medicine for diarrhea. Acids present in lichens mean their consumption may cause an upset stomach, especially if not well cooked.

According to a study published in 2017, reindeer lichen was able to grow on burnt soil as soon as two years after a forest fire in Northern Sweden, indicating that artificial replanting of lichen could be a useful strategy for the restoration of reindeer pastures.

<doc id="627541" wikidata="Q75789" url="?curid=627541" title="Cosima Wagner">
<text>Francesca Gaetana Cosima Wagner (; 24 December 1837 – 1April 1930) was the daughter of the Hungarian composer and pianist Franz Liszt and Franco-German romantic author Marie d&#x27;Agoult. She became the second wife of the German composer Richard Wagner, and with him founded the Bayreuth Festival as a showcase for his stage works; after his death she devoted the rest of her life to the promotion of his music and philosophy. Commentators have recognised Cosima as the principal inspiration for Wagner&#x27;s later works, particularly &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

In 1857, after a childhood largely spent under the care of her grandmother and with governesses, Cosima married the conductor Hans von Bülow. Although the marriage produced two children, it was largely a loveless union, and in 1863 Cosima began a relationship with Wagner, who was 24 years her senior. They married in 1870; after Wagner&#x27;s death in 1883 she directed the Bayreuth Festival for more than 20 years, increasing its repertoire to form the Bayreuth canon of ten operas and establishing the festival as a major event in the world of musical theatre.

During her directorship, Cosima opposed theatrical innovations and adhered closely to Wagner&#x27;s original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner&#x27;s convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism. This was a defining aspect of Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely followed her death there in 1930. Thus, although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.

== Family background and early childhood ==

In January 1833 the 21-year-old Hungarian composer and pianist Franz Liszt met Marie d&#x27;Agoult, a Parisian socialite six years his senior. Marie&#x27;s antecedents were mixed; her German mother, from a prominent Frankfurt banking family, had married a French nobleman, the Comte de Flavigny. Marie had been married since 1827 to Charles, Comte d&#x27;Agoult, and had borne him two daughters, but the union had become sterile. Drawn together by their mutual intellectual interests, Marie and Liszt embarked on a passionate relationship. In March 1835 the couple fled Paris for Switzerland; ignoring the scandal they left in their wake, they settled in Geneva where, on 18 December, Marie gave birth to a daughter, Blandine-Rachel.

In the following two years Liszt and Marie travelled widely in pursuit of his career as a concert pianist. Late in 1837, when Marie was heavily pregnant with their second child, the couple were at Como in Italy. Here, on 24 December in a lakeside hotel in Bellagio, a second daughter was born. They named her Francesca Gaetana Cosima, the unusual third name being derived from St Cosmas, a patron saint of physicians and apothecaries; it was as &quot;Cosima&quot; that the child became known. With her sister she was left in the care of wet nurses (a common practice at the time), while Liszt and Marie continued to travel in Europe. Their third child and only son, Daniel, was born on 9 May 1839 in Venice.

In 1839, while Liszt continued his travels, Marie took the social risk of returning to Paris with her daughters. Her hopes of recovering her status in the city were dented when her influential mother, Madame de Flavigny, refused to acknowledge the children; Marie would not be accepted socially while her daughters were clearly in evidence. Liszt&#x27;s solution was to remove the girls from Marie and place them with his mother, Anna Liszt, in her Paris home while Daniel remained with nurses in Venice. By this means, both Marie and Liszt could continue their independent lives. Relations between the couple cooled, and by 1841 they were seeing little of each other; it is likely that both engaged in other affairs. By 1845 the breach between them was such that they were communicating only through third parties. Liszt forbade contact between mother and daughters; Marie accused him of attempting to steal &quot;the fruits of a mother&#x27;s womb&quot;, while Liszt insisted on his sole right to decide the children&#x27;s future. Marie threatened to fight him &quot;like a lioness&quot;, but soon gave up the struggle. Though they were living in the same city, she did not see either of her daughters for five years, until 1850.

== Schooling and adolescence ==
Cosima and Blandine remained with Anna Liszt until 1850, joined eventually by Daniel. Cosima&#x27;s biographer George Marek describes Anna as &quot;a simple, uneducated, unworldly but warmhearted woman ... for the first time [the girls] experienced what it was to be touched by love&quot;. Of the sisters, Blandine was evidently the prettier; Cosima, with her long nose and wide mouth was described as an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;. Although Liszt&#x27;s relations with his children were formal and distant, he provided for them liberally, and ensured that they were well educated. Both girls were sent to Madame Bernard&#x27;s, an exclusive boarding school, while Daniel was prepared for the prestigious Lycée Bonaparte.
In 1847 Liszt met Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, the estranged wife of a German prince who lived in Russia. By the autumn of 1848 she and Liszt had become lovers, and their relationship lasted for the remainder of his life. She quickly assumed responsibility for the management of Liszt&#x27;s life, including the upbringing of his daughters. Early in 1850 Liszt had been disturbed to learn that Blandine and Cosima were seeing their mother again; his response, guided by the princess, was to remove them from their school and place them into the full-time care of Carolyne&#x27;s old governess, the 72-year-old Madame Patersi de Fossombroni. Liszt&#x27;s instructions were clear—Madame Patersi was to control every aspect of the girls&#x27; lives: &quot;She alone is to decide what is to be permitted them and what forbidden&quot;.

Blandine and Cosima were subjected to the Patersi curriculum for four years. Cosima&#x27;s biographer Oliver Hilmes likens the regime to that used for breaking in horses, though Marek describes it as exacting but ultimately beneficial to Cosima: &quot;Above all, Patersi taught her how a &#x27;noble lady&#x27; must behave, how to alight from a carriage, how to enter a drawing room, how to greet a duchess as against a commoner ... and how not to betray herself when she was hurt&quot;. On 10 October 1853 Liszt arrived at the Patersi apartment, his first visit to his daughters since 1845. With him were two fellow-composers: Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner. Carolyne&#x27;s daughter Marie, who was present, described Cosima&#x27;s appearance as &quot;in the worst phase of adolescence, tall and angular, sallow ... the image of her father. Only her long golden hair, of unusual sheen, was beautiful&quot;. After a family meal, Wagner read to the group from his text for the final act of what was to become &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;. Cosima seems to have made little impression on him; in his memoirs he merely recorded that both girls were very shy.

== Marriage to Hans von Bülow ==

As his daughters approached womanhood, Liszt felt that a change in their lives was called for and in 1855 he arranged (over their mother&#x27;s bitter protests) for them to move to Berlin. Here they were placed in the care of Baroness Franziska von Bülow, member of the prominent Bülow family, whose son Hans was Liszt&#x27;s most outstanding pupil; he would take charge of the girls&#x27; musical education while Frau von Bülow supervised their general and moral welfare. Hans von Bülow, born in 1830, had abandoned his legal education after hearing Liszt conduct the premiere of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; at Weimar in August 1850, and had decided to dedicate his life to music. After a brief spell conducting in small opera houses, Bülow studied with Liszt, who was convinced that he would become a great concert pianist. Bülow was quickly impressed by Cosima&#x27;s own skill as a pianist, in which he saw the stamp of her father, and the pair developed romantic feelings for each other. Liszt approved the match, and the marriage took place at St. Hedwig&#x27;s Cathedral, Berlin, on 18 August 1857. During their honeymoon, along with Liszt they visited Wagner at his home near Zurich. This visit was repeated the following year, when Cosima, on taking her leave, shocked Wagner with an emotional demonstration: &quot;[S]he fell at my feet, covered my hands with tears and kisses ... I pondered the mystery, without being able to solve it&quot;.

Cosima, a Parisian by upbringing, found it hard to adjust to life in Berlin, which was then a more provincial city than Paris. Her attempts to mix with local society, according to Marie zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, were handicapped by &quot;[h]er exaggerated self-esteem and innate causticity&quot;, which alienated the men and women in her circle. At least initially, Cosima took an interest in her husband&#x27;s career, encouraging him to extend his activities into composition. On one occasion she provided him with a scenario she had written for an opera based on the story of Merlin, court magician to King Arthur. However, nothing came of this project. Bülow&#x27;s crowded professional schedule left Cosima alone for long periods, during which she worked for the French-language magazine &quot;Revue germanique&quot; as a translator and contributor. In December 1859 she was saddened by the death of her brother Daniel, at the age of twenty, after a long wasting illness. Cosima&#x27;s first child, a daughter born on 12 October 1860, was named Daniela in Daniel&#x27;s memory. A further, unexpected blow for Cosima fell in September 1862, when her sister Blandine, who had shared much of her upbringing, died in childbirth—she had been married to Émile Ollivier, a Parisian lawyer, since October 1857. Cosima&#x27;s second daughter, born in March 1863, was named .

Bülow was committed to Wagner&#x27;s music; in 1858 he had undertaken the preparation of a vocal score for &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, and by 1862 he was making a of &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. A social relationship developed, and during the summer of 1862 the Bülows stayed with Wagner at the composer&#x27;s home at Biebrich. Wagner records that Cosima became &quot;transfigured&quot; by his rendering of &quot;Wotan&#x27;s Farewell&quot; from &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. In October 1862, just after Blandine&#x27;s death, Wagner and Bülow shared conducting duties at a concert in Leipzig; Wagner records that, during a rehearsal, &quot;I felt utterly transported by the sight of Cosima ... she appeared to me as if stepping from another world&quot;. In these years Wagner&#x27;s emotional life was in disarray. He was still married to his first wife, Minna Planer (she was to die in 1866), and was involved in several extramarital relationships. On 28 November 1863 Wagner visited Berlin; while Bülow was rehearsing a concert, Wagner and Cosima took a long cab ride through Berlin and declared their feelings for each other: &quot;with tears and sobs&quot;, Wagner later wrote, &quot;we sealed our confession to belong to each other alone&quot;.

== With Wagner ==

=== Munich and Tribschen ===

In 1864 Wagner&#x27;s financial position was transformed by his new patron, the 18-year-old King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who paid off the composer&#x27;s debts and awarded him a generous annual stipend. Ludwig also provided Wagner with a lakeside retreat at Lake Starnberg, and a grand house in Munich. At Wagner&#x27;s instigation, von Bülow accepted a post as Ludwig&#x27;s &quot;royal pianist&quot;; he and Cosima moved to Munich, and took a house conveniently close to Wagner&#x27;s, ostensibly so that Cosima could work as the composer&#x27;s secretary. From 29 June 1864 Cosima spent more than a week alone with Wagner at Lake Starnberg, before von Bülow joined them on 7 July. According to Wagner&#x27;s housekeeper, Anna Mrazek, &quot;it was easy to tell that something was going on between Frau Cosima and Richard Wagner&quot;. Mrazek said that later in the visit von Bülow found his wife in Wagner&#x27;s bedroom, but nevertheless made no demands for an explanation, either from Wagner or from his wife. Nine months after this visit, on 10 April 1865, Cosima gave birth to a daughter, Isolde. Such was von Bülow&#x27;s devotion to Wagner that he accepted the child as his own, and registered her as &quot;the legitimate daughter&quot; of Hans and Cosima von Bülow. Wagner attended the Catholic baptism on 24 April. On 10 June 1865, at the Munich Hofoper, von Bülow conducted the premiere of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;.

Wagner&#x27;s role at Ludwig&#x27;s court became controversial; in particular, Ludwig&#x27;s habit of referring Wagner&#x27;s policy ideas to his ministers alarmed the court. When Wagner demanded the sacking both of Ludwig&#x27;s cabinet secretary and of his prime minister, there was a public outcry, and in December 1865 Ludwig reluctantly told Wagner to leave Bavaria. The king did not, however, withdraw his patronage or financial support. After a few months&#x27; wandering, in March 1866 Wagner arrived in Geneva, where Cosima joined him. They travelled together to Lucerne where they found a large lakeside house, the Villa Tribschen. Wagner made immediate arrangements to rent the house, at the king&#x27;s expense, and by 15 April was installed in his new home.

Immediately upon signing the lease, Wagner invited the von Bülows and their children to stay with him. They spent the summer there, returning briefly to Munich before von Bülow left for Basel while Cosima went back to Tribschen. By now von Bülow understood his wife&#x27;s relationship with Wagner; he wrote to a friend that &quot;since February 1865 I was in absolutely no doubt about the extremely peculiar nature of the situation&quot;. Wagner, anxious to avoid associating Cosima in a public scandal, deceived Ludwig into issuing a statement in June 1866 which declared the unbroken sanctity of the von Bülows&#x27; marriage, and promised retribution for those daring to suggest otherwise. By this time Cosima was pregnant with her second child by Wagner; a daughter, Eva, was born at Tribschen on 17 February 1867. Through all this, von Bülow retained his devotion to Wagner&#x27;s music. He had been appointed music director of the Munich Hofoper, and threw himself into the preparations for the premiere of &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. This took place on 21 June 1868 under his baton, and was a great success. Shortly afterwards, Cosima rejoined Wagner at Tribschen; Wagner explained to the king that she could not bear the insults to which she was continually subjected in Munich, and wished to escape from the world.

In October 1868 Cosima asked her husband for a divorce, to which he would not initially agree. To sceptical enquirers he explained her absence from the von Bülow family home by a supposed visit to her half-sister in Versailles. In June 1869, immediately after the birth of her and Wagner&#x27;s third and final child, Siegfried, Cosima wrote to von Bülow in what she called a &quot;final attempt at an understanding&quot;. His reply was conciliatory; he wrote: &quot;You have preferred to consecrate the treasures of your heart and mind to a higher being: far from censuring you for this step, I approve of it&quot;. Legal processes extended the marriage until 18 July 1870, when the divorce was finally sanctioned by a Berlin court. After the divorce von Bülow distanced himself from both Wagner and Cosima; he never again spoke to Wagner, and 11 years passed before his next meeting with Cosima.

Wagner and Cosima were married at Lucerne, on 25 August 1870, in a Protestant church. Cosima&#x27;s journal for that day records: &quot;May I be worthy of bearing R&#x27;s name!&quot; Liszt was not informed in advance of the wedding, and learned of it first through the newspapers. The year ended on a high note for the Wagners: on 25 December, the day on which Cosima always celebrated her birthday although she had been born on the 24th, she awoke to the sounds of music. She commemorated the event in her journal: &quot;... music was sounding, and what music! After it had died away, R ... put into my hands the score of his &quot;Symphonic Birthday Greeting. ... R had set up his orchestra on the stairs, and thus consecrated our Tribschen forever!&quot; This was the first performance of the music that became known as the &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot;.

=== Bayreuth ===

==== Building the &quot;Festspielhaus&quot; ====

Wagner&#x27;s deception over his relationship with Cosima had seriously damaged his standing with Ludwig. Matters were worsened by Ludwig&#x27;s insistence, over Wagner&#x27;s objections, that the premieres of the two completed &quot;Ring&quot; operas, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, be given at once, in Munich, rather than as part of a complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle on some future date at a venue of Wagner&#x27;s choosing. To Wagner&#x27;s mortification these premieres took place, under Franz Wüllner, on 22 September 1869 and 26 June 1870 respectively. The need for a theatre of his own, and full artistic control, was now clear to Wagner. On 5 March 1870 Cosima, according to her journal, advised him to &quot;look up the article on Baireuth in the encyclopaedia&quot;. Wagner knew the town from a short visit he had made there in 1835; he was attracted to it by its central location and by its quiet non-fashionability. When he and Cosima visited in April 1871 they decided immediately that they would build their theatre there, and that the town would be their future home.

Wagner announced the first Bayreuth Festival for 1873, at which his full &quot;Ring&quot; cycle would be performed. Aware of the honour that such an event would bring to the town, the local council donated a large plot of land—the &quot;Green Hill&quot;—overlooking the town, as a site for the theatre. Since Ludwig had declined to finance the project, the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the initial festival was deferred. By the spring of 1873 only a third of the required funds had been raised; further pleas to Ludwig were initially ignored, but early in 1874, with the entire project on the verge of collapse, the king relented and provided a loan. The full building programme included a handsome villa, &quot;Wahnfried&quot;, into which Wagner, with Cosima and the children, moved from their temporary accommodation on 18 April 1874. The theatre was completed in 1875, and the festival scheduled for the following year. Commenting on the struggle to finish the building Wagner remarked to Cosima: &quot;Each stone is red with my blood and yours&quot;.

During this period Cosima admitted to Liszt, who had taken minor orders in the Catholic Church, that she intended to convert to Protestantism. Her motive may have been more the desire to maintain solidarity with Wagner than from religious conviction; Hilmes maintains that at heart, &quot;Cosima remained a pietistic Catholic until her dying day&quot;. On 31 October 1872 Cosima received her first Protestant sacrament alongside Wagner: &quot;a deeply moving occasion ... what a lovely thing religion is! What other power could produce such feelings!&quot;

==== First festival ====

In March 1876, Cosima and Wagner were in Berlin when they learned that Marie d&#x27;Agoult had died in Paris. Unable to attend the funeral, Cosima expressed her feelings in a letter to her daughter Daniela: &quot;There is nothing left for me to do, except to grieve for the woman that brought me into the world&quot;.

From June onwards, Cosima&#x27;s journal entries consist almost entirely of comments on the forthcoming festival&#x27;s rehearsals, sometimes warmly approving, often critical and anxious; for example, she found the costumes &quot;reminiscent throughout of Red Indian chiefs ... all the marks of provincial tastelessness&quot;. From the beginning of August 1876 distinguished guests began to converge on the town; Ludwig, incognito, attended the final dress rehearsals between 6 and 9 August, but then left the town, reappearing in time to attend the final performances of the festival. Among other royal visitors were the German emperor Wilhelm I, Dom Pedro II of Brazil and an assortment of princes and grand dukes from the European royal families. Many of Europe&#x27;s leading composers came: Bruckner, Tchaikovsky, Saint-Saëns, and Cosima&#x27;s father, Liszt, who held court at Wahnfried among the notables who gathered there. Also in Bayreuth was Wagner&#x27;s current mistress, Judith Gautier. It is unlikely that Cosima knew of the affair at this time, though she may have harboured a degree of suspicion. Cosima&#x27;s demeanour as the festival&#x27;s hostess was described by a young American visitor in fulsome terms: &quot;Mme Wagner is exceedingly gracious and affable ... a magnificent-looking woman, a perfect queen ...&quot;

The festival began on 13 August and lasted until 30th. It consisted of three full &quot;Ring&quot; cycles, all under the baton of Hans Richter. At the end, critical reactions ranged between that of the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, who thought the entire work &quot;divinely composed&quot;, and that of the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; who called the music &quot;the dream of a lunatic&quot;. Wagner himself was far from satisfied; in a letter to Ludwig he denounced the singers Albert Niemann and Franz Betz as &quot;theatrical parasites&quot; and complained that Richter had not got a single tempo correct. Months later, Cosima records, his attitude towards the productions was &quot;Never again, never again!&quot;.

==== &quot;Parsifal&quot; ====

After the conclusion of the festival and the departure of the guests, Wagner and Cosima left with the children for Venice, where they remained until December. The festival had accumulated a large financial deficit; this, and Wagner&#x27;s deep artistic dissatisfaction, precluded the possibility of any repeat in the near future. Wagner&#x27;s mood was such that he seriously contemplated giving up the entire Bayreuth project; he was distracted from such thoughts by an invitation to conduct a series of concerts in London. Leaving the children behind, he and Cosima enjoyed a two-month break in England where, among others, Cosima met the novelist George Eliot, the poet Robert Browning, and the painter Edward Burne-Jones (who made a number of sketches of Cosima from which no finished painting emerged). On 17 May both Wagners were received by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. 

The English tour raised little money but restored Wagner&#x27;s spirits. On his return he began work on what would prove to be his final stage work, &quot;Parsifal&quot;, a project that would occupy him for most of the next five years. Cosima&#x27;s influence was such that Wagner asserted that he would not have written another note, had she not been there. On a practical level, when the festival&#x27;s creditors began to press for payment, Cosima&#x27;s personal plea to Ludwig in 1878 persuaded the king to provide a loan to pay off the outstanding debt and open the door to the prospect of a second Bayreuth Festival. For Cosima&#x27;s birthday on 25 December 1878, Wagner hired an orchestra to play the newly composed prelude to &quot;Parsifal&quot;. The concert also included the &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot;; Cosima wrote afterwards: &quot;There stands he who has called forth these wonders, and he loves me. He loves me!&quot;.

Progress on &quot;Parsifal&quot; was hampered by Wagner&#x27;s recurrent ill-health, but by late 1880 he announced the next festival for 1882, to be devoted entirely to the new work. Wagner secured Ludwig&#x27;s agreement that &quot;Parsifal&quot; should be staged exclusively at Bayreuth, but in return, Ludwig required that his current Munich Kapellmeister, Hermann Levi, should conduct the festival. Wagner objected on the grounds of Levi&#x27;s Jewish faith; &quot;Parsifal&quot;, he maintained, was a &quot;Christian&quot; opera. Both he and Cosima were vehement anti-Semites; Hilmes conjectures that Cosima inherited this in her youth, from her father, from Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, probably from Madame Patersi and, a little later, from Bülow, &quot;an anti-Semite of the first order&quot;. Thus Cosima&#x27;s anti-Semitism predates her association with Wagner, although Marek observes that he nurtured it in her, to the extent that derogatory references to Jews occur, on average, on every fourth page of her 5,000-page journal. The musicologist Eric Werner argues that Wagner&#x27;s anti-Semitism derived in part from his initial revolutionary philosophy; as a disciple of Proudhon he saw Jewry as &quot;the embodiment of possession, of monopoly capitalism&quot;. Cosima&#x27;s had no such basis, and whereas Wagner retained an ability to revise his views on the basis of his experiences, Cosima&#x27;s anti-Semitism was visceral and remained unchanged. Cosima records Levi&#x27;s astonishment on being informed of his appointment. Ludwig was insistent that, despite Wagner&#x27;s objections, the appointment would stand. Levi would subsequently establish himself as the supreme conductor of the work, held by critical opinion to be &quot;beyond praise&quot;.

At the second Bayreuth Festival &quot;Parsifal&quot; was performed 16 times; at the last performance on 29 August, Wagner himself conducted the final scene. Cosima wrote afterwards of how different the orchestra and singers sounded under Wagner. Overall, she and Wagner were entirely satisfied with the outcome of the festival which, unlike its predecessor, had made a handsome profit: &quot;[N]ot once did the spirit of toil and dedication on the part of the artists abate ... I believe one may be satisfied&quot;. One dissident voice was that of Friedrich Nietzsche, once a devoted friend of Wagner&#x27;s but latterly a harsh critic. Nietzsche considered &quot;Parsifal&quot; an abomination for which Cosima was responsible; she had corrupted Wagner.

=== Venice and widowhood ===

At the conclusion of the festival the Wagner family departed for an extended stay in Venice. To accommodate the large party of children, servants and expected guests they took a spacious apartment in the Palazzo Vendramin Calergi, overlooking the Grand Canal. The principal concern during the autumn and winter months was Wagner&#x27;s declining health; his heart spasms had become so frequent that on 16 November 1882 Cosima recorded: &quot;Today he did have a spasm!&quot;. Cosima&#x27;s journal entry for 12 February 1883—the last she was to make—records Wagner reading Fouqué&#x27;s novel &quot;Undine&quot;, and playing the Rhinemaidens&#x27; lament from &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; on the piano. However, it has been alleged that an underlying cause of domestic friction may have surfaced concerning Carrie Pringle, an English soprano from the &quot;Parsifal&quot; cast who may have been rumoured to be having an affair with Wagner. According to Isolde, recalling the occasion much later, the Pringle suspicions led to a furious row between Cosima and Wagner on the morning of 13 February. There is no evidence of an affair between Wagner and Pringle, nor is Isolde&#x27;s story of a row supported by any other testimony. At around noon on that day, Wagner suffered a fatal heart attack, and he died in the middle of the afternoon.

Cosima sat with Wagner&#x27;s body for more than 24 hours, refusing all refreshment or respite. During the embalming process, which occupied the next two days, Cosima sat with the body as often as possible, to the dismay of her children. She also asked her daughters to cut her hair, which was then sewn into a cushion and placed on Wagner&#x27;s breast. On 16 February the journey back to Bayreuth began, and on Sunday 18 February the cortège processed to Wahnfried, where, following a brief service, Wagner was buried in the garden. Cosima remained in the house until the ceremonies were over; according to her daughter Daniela she then went to the grave &quot;and for a long time lay down on the coffin until Fidi (Siegfried) went to fetch her&quot;. Afterwards she went into seclusion for many months, barely even seeing her children, with whom she communicated mainly through written notes. Among many messages, she received a telegram from Bülow: &quot;Soeur il faut vivre&quot; (&quot;Sister, it is necessary to live&quot;).

== Mistress of Bayreuth ==

=== Interregnum ===

Wagner had left neither a will, nor instruction on the management of the Bayreuth Festival after his death. He had written of the future: &quot;I ... cannot think of a single person who could say what I believe needs to be said ... there is practically no one on whose judgement I could rely&quot;. The festival&#x27;s uncertain outlook was aggravated by Cosima&#x27;s total withdrawal from all contact except that of her daughters and her friend and adviser Adolf von Groß. Without Cosima&#x27;s participation the 1883 festival, as planned by Wagner—12 performances of &quot;Parsifal&quot;—went ahead, with Emil Scaria (who sang the role of Gurnemanz in the opera) doubling as artistic director. The cast was largely that of 1882, and Levi remained as conductor.

At the conclusion of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner&#x27;s directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life&#x27;s mission: the maintenance of Wagner&#x27;s heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival&#x27;s chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß&#x27;s assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner&#x27;s property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival&#x27;s future.

=== In control ===
In 1885 Cosima announced that she would direct the 1886 festival. Her tenure as Bayreuth&#x27;s director lasted for 22 years, until 1907. During that time she oversaw 13 festivals, and by gradually increasing the repertory established the &quot;Bayreuth canon&quot; of ten mature Wagner works. Her triumvirate of conductors—Levi, Richter and Felix Mottl—shared the musical direction until 1894, when Levi left. Richter and Mottl served throughout Cosima&#x27;s years, joined by several of the leading conductors of the day, although Bülow resisted all offers to participate. In the course of her long stewardship Cosima overcame the misgivings of the hardline Wagnerites patrons who believed that Wagner&#x27;s works should not be entrusted to a non-German. Under her watch the festival moved from an uncertain financial basis into a prosperous business undertaking that brought great riches to the Wagner family.

Although the festival&#x27;s historian, Frederic Spotts, suggests that Cosima was more creative than she affected to be, the primary purpose of all her productions was to follow the instructions and reflect the wishes of the Master: &quot;There is nothing left for us here to create, but only to perfect in detail&quot;. This policy incurred criticism, among others from Bernard Shaw, who in 1889 mocked Cosima as the &quot;chief remembrancer&quot;. Shaw scorned the idea that Wagner&#x27;s wishes were best represented by the slavish copying in perpetuity of the performances he had witnessed. Ten years later Shaw highlighted as a feature of the &quot;Bayreuth style&quot; the &quot;intolerably old-fashioned tradition of half rhetorical, half historical-pictorial attitudes and gestures&quot;, and the characteristic singing, &quot;sometime tolerable, sometimes abominable&quot;. The subordination of the music to text, diction and character portrayal was a specific feature of the Bayreuth style; Cosima, according to Spotts, turned the principle of clear enunciation into &quot;a fetish ... The resulting harsh declamatory style came to be derided as ... the infamous Bayreuth bark&quot;.

&quot;Parsifal&quot; was shown alongside other works at each of Cosima&#x27;s festivals except for 1896, which was devoted to a revival of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. In 1886, her first year in charge, she added &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; to the canon. Amid the bustle of the festival Cosima refused to be distracted by the illness of her father, Liszt, who collapsed after attending a performance of &quot;Tristan&quot; and died several days later. Cosima supervised her father&#x27;s funeral service and burial arrangements, but refused a memorial concert or any overt display of remembrance. According to Liszt&#x27;s pupil Felix Weingartner, &quot;Liszt&#x27;s passing was not of sufficient importance to dim the glory of the Festival, even for a moment&quot;.

&quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; was added in 1888, &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; in 1891, &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in 1894 and &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; in 1901. After the 1894 festival Levi resigned, the years of working in an anti-Semitic ambience having finally had their effect. At the 1896 festival Siegfried made his Bayreuth conducting debut in one of the five &quot;Ring&quot; cycles; he remained one of Bayreuth&#x27;s regular conductors for the remainder of Cosima&#x27;s tenure.

In common with Wagner, Cosima was willing to shelve her anti-Semitic prejudices in the interests of Bayreuth, to the extent of continuing to employ Levi for whom she developed considerable artistic respect. However, she frequently undermined him behind his back in private letters, and allowed her children to mimic and mock him. Cosima expressed to Weingartner the view that &quot;between Aryan and Semite blood there could exist no bond whatever&quot;. In accordance with this doctrine, she would not invite Gustav Mahler (born Jewish though a convert to Catholicism) to conduct at Bayreuth, although she frequently took his advice over artistic matters.

Cosima was determined to preserve Bayreuth&#x27;s exclusive right, acknowledged by Ludwig, to perform &quot;Parsifal&quot;. After Ludwig&#x27;s death in 1886 this right was briefly challenged by his successor, an attempt swiftly defeated by Cosima with the help of Groß. A more serious threat arose from the German copyright laws, which only protected works for 30 years following the creator&#x27;s death; thus &quot;Parsifal&quot; would lose its protection in 1913 regardless of any agreement with the Bavarian court. In anticipation, in 1901 Cosima sought to have the period of copyright protection extended by law to 50 years. She lobbied members of the Reichstag tirelessly, and was assured by Kaiser Wilhelm II of his support. These efforts failed to bring about any change in the law. In 1903, taking advantage of the lack of a copyright agreement between the United States and Germany, Heinrich Conried of the New York Metropolitan Opera announced that he would stage &quot;Parsifal&quot; later that year. Cosima was enraged, but her efforts to prevent him were to no avail; the first of 11 performances took place on 24 December 1903. The enterprise was a popular and critical success, though in Cosima&#x27;s view it was a &quot;rape&quot;; her hostility towards the Metropolitan lasted for the remainder of her life.

By the beginning of the new century three of Cosima&#x27;s daughters had married: Blandina to Count Biagio Gravina in the closing days of the 1882 festival, Daniela to Henry Thode, an art historian, on 3 July 1886, and Isolde, Cosima&#x27;s first child by Wagner, who married a young conductor, , on 20 December 1900. The youngest daughter, Eva, rejected numerous suitors to remain her mother&#x27;s secretary and companion for the rest of Cosima&#x27;s tenure.

=== Transfer of power ===
On 8 December 1906, having directed that year&#x27;s festival, Cosima suffered an Adams-Stokes seizure (a form of heart attack) while visiting her friend Prince Hohenlohe at Langenburg. By May 1907 it was clear that her health was such that she could no longer remain in charge at Bayreuth; this responsibility now passed to Siegfried, her long-designated heir. The succession was accomplished against a background of family disagreement; Beidler thought that he had rights, based partly on his greater conducting experience and also because he and Isolde had produced Wagner&#x27;s only grandchild, a son born in October 1901, who could establish a dynastic succession. Beidler&#x27;s claims were dismissed by Cosima and by Siegfried; he never conducted at Bayreuth again, and the rift between the Beidlers and Cosima developed in due course into a major family feud.

== Retirement, decline and death ==
Cosima moved into rooms to the rear of Wahnfried, away from the house&#x27;s daily bustle, where she passed her days surrounded by Wagner&#x27;s possessions and numerous family portraits. Although at first Siegfried discussed his festival plans with her, she avoided the Festpielhaus, content to read reports of the productions. Siegfried made few changes to the production traditions set by Wagner and Cosima; Spotts records that &quot;whatever had been laid down by his parents was preserved unchanged out of a sense of strict filial duty&quot;. Only in matters on which they had not spoken was he prepared to exercise his own judgement. As a result, the original &quot;Parsifal&quot; sets remained in use even when they were visibly crumbling; the view of Cosima and her daughters was that no changes should ever be made to stage sets &quot;on which the eye of the Master had rested&quot;.

In December 1908 Eva, then 41, married Houston Stewart Chamberlain, a British-born historian who had adopted as his personal creed a fanatical form of German nationalism based on principles of extreme racial and cultural purity. He had known Cosima since 1888, though his affinity with Wagner extended back to 1882, when he had attended the premiere of &quot;Parsifal&quot;. He had successively courted Blandina and then Isolde, before settling on Eva. Cosima had considerable empathy with his theories; according to Carr &quot;she came to love him as her son—perhaps even more&quot;. Chamberlain became the dominant figure within the Wagner circle, and was largely responsible for the increasing alienation of the Beidlers. Cosima may have been unaware of Isolde&#x27;s attempts at rapprochement, because Eva and Chamberlain withheld Isolde&#x27;s letters. In 1913 Isolde was effectively disinherited when she sought to confirm her rights as a co-heir to the considerable Wagner fortunes in a court case, which she lost. After this she withdrew, and to the time of her death in 1919 never again saw or communicated directly with Cosima.
A happier family event from Cosima&#x27;s standpoint was Siegfried&#x27;s marriage in 1915, at the age of 46, to Winifred Williams, the 18-year-old foster-daughter of Karl Klindworth who had been friends with both Wagner and Liszt. When the couple&#x27;s first son, Wieland, was born on 5 January 1917, Cosima celebrated by playing excerpts from the &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot; on Wagner&#x27;s piano.

The outbreak of the First World War curtailed the 1914 festival; the conflict and the political and economic upheavals that followed the war closed the Festpielhaus until 1924. Plans for the festival&#x27;s resumption coincided with an upsurge in Germany of extreme nationalist politics. Adolf Hitler, a fervent Wagner admirer, first visited Wahnfried in 1923, and although he was not received by Cosima he befriended the family and was thereafter a regular visitor. The Chamberlains, together with Winifred, became enthusiastic members of the Nazi Party, and the 1924 festival became an overt rally for the party and its leading supporters. That year Cosima, then 86, ended her long absence from the theatre by attending the dress rehearsals for &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and watching the first act at the opening performance on 23 July. The tenor Lauritz Melchior remembered Siegfried returning from frequent visits to a small gallery above the stage and saying &quot;Mama wants...&quot;

By 1927, the year of her 90th birthday, Cosima&#x27;s health was failing. The birthday was marked in Bayreuth by the naming of a street in her honour, although she was unaware; the family thought that knowledge of the celebrations would overexcite her. In her last years she was virtually bedridden, became blind, and was lucid only at intervals. She died, aged 92, on 1 April 1930; after a funeral service at Wahnfried her body was taken to Coburg and cremated. In 1977, 47 years after her death, Cosima&#x27;s urn was recovered from Coburg and buried alongside Wagner in the Wahnfried garden.

== Legacy ==
Cosima&#x27;s life mission was total service to Wagner and his works; in the words of the music critic Eric Salzman she &quot;submitted herself body and soul to the Master&quot;. In Wagner&#x27;s lifetime she fulfilled this purpose primarily by recording in her journal every facet of his life and ideas. After his death the journal was abandoned; she would henceforth serve the master by perpetuating his artistic heritage through the Bayreuth Festival. Guided by Groß, but also using her own acumen—Werner calls her a &quot;superb business woman&quot;—she succeeded in making the festival first solvent, then profitable.

While acknowledging that Cosima was an effective &quot;keeper of the flame&quot;, commentators have criticised the nature of her legacy. The &quot;Ring&quot; historian J. K. Holman describes it as one of &quot;stifling conservatism&quot;. Her policy of sticking to Wagner&#x27;s original stage conceptions was not fully abandoned until after the Second World War, when a new generation took charge of the festival. Hilmes likens Cosima&#x27;s role to that of the abbess of a religious community: &quot;a cohesive, quasi-religious congregation of Bayreuthians sharing a common philosophical outlook&quot;. Anti-Semitism was integral to this philosophy; although in 1869 Cosima had opposed the re-publication of Wagner&#x27;s anti-Jewish treatise &quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;, this was on grounds of commercial prudence rather than sensitivity. In 1881 she encouraged Wagner to write his essay &quot;Know Thyself&quot;, and to include in it a tirade against Jewish assimilation.

The critic and one-time librettist Philip Hensher writes that &quot;under the guidance of her repulsive racial-theorist son-in-law [Chamberlain] ... Cosima tried to turn Bayreuth into a centre for the cult of German purity.&quot; Thus, he continues, &quot;By the time she died, Wagner&#x27;s reputation was ... at the forefront of a terrible political dynamism: antique stagings of his works were presented to audiences of Brownshirts&quot;. The close association of the festival with Hitler and the Nazis during the 1930s was much more the work of Winifred—an overt Hitler supporter—than of Cosima, though Hensher asserts that &quot;Cosima was as much to blame as anyone&quot;.

In the immediate aftermath of Cosima&#x27;s death, some writers heaped copious praise on her. Ernest Newman, Wagner&#x27;s biographer, called her &quot;the greatest figure that ever came within [Wagner&#x27;s] circle&quot;; , Cosima&#x27;s first biographer, introduced her as &quot;the greatest woman of the century&quot;. In time judgements became more measured, and divided. Marek closes his account by emphasising her role not only as Wagner&#x27;s protector but as his muse: &quot;Without her there would have been no &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot;, no Bayreuth, and no &quot;Parsifal&quot;&quot;. In Hensher&#x27;s judgement, &quot;Wagner was a genius, but also a fairly appalling human being. Cosima was just an appalling human being.&quot;

== Archives ==
Cosima Wagner&#x27;s letters to Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, written in 1896–1905, are preserved in the Hohenlohe Central Archive (Hohenlohe-Zentralarchiv Neuenstein), which is in Neuenstein Castle in the town of Neuenstein, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

Cosima Wagner&#x27;s diaries were published in Germany in 1976 and translated into English in 1978. They run to more than 4,000 pages. In his comment to the publisher appearing on the second volume&#x27;s dust-jacket, the scholar George Steiner remarked that mining these texts for important detail contextualizing various significant historical events and phenomena was likely &quot;to be a task that occupies generations of scholars.&quot;

<text>In mechanical engineering, a rolling-element bearing, also known as a rolling bearing, is a bearing which carries a load by placing rolling elements (such as balls, cylinders, or cones) between two concentric, grooved rings called races. The relative motion of the races causes the rolling elements to roll with very little rolling resistance and with little sliding.

One of the earliest and best-known rolling-element bearings are sets of logs laid on the ground with a large stone block on top. As the stone is pulled, the logs roll along the ground with little sliding friction. As each log comes out the back, it is moved to the front where the block then rolls on to it. It is possible to imitate such a bearing by placing several pens or pencils on a table and placing an item on top of them. See &quot;bearings&quot; for more on the historical development of bearings.

A rolling element rotary bearing uses a shaft in a much larger hole, and spheres or cylinders called &quot;rollers&quot; tightly fill the space between the shaft and hole. As the shaft turns, each roller acts as the logs in the above example. However, since the bearing is round, the rollers never fall out from under the load.

Rolling-element bearings have the advantage of a good trade-off between cost, size, weight, carrying capacity, durability, accuracy, friction, and so on. Other bearing designs are often better on one specific attribute, but worse in most other attributes, although fluid bearings can sometimes simultaneously outperform on carrying capacity, durability, accuracy, friction, rotation rate and sometimes cost. Only plain bearings are used as widely as rolling-element bearings. Common mechanical components where they are widely used are – automotive, industrial, marine, and aerospace applications. They are products of great necessity for modern technology. The rolling element bearing was developed from a firm foundation that was built over thousands of years. The concept emerged in its primitive form in Roman times. After a long inactive period in the Middle Ages, it was revived during the Renaissance by Leonardo da Vinci, and developed steadily in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

== History of bearings timeline ==
* Beginning in 2600 BCE - The Ancient Egyptians were the first to notably use the concept behind rolling bearings, they first did this by using logs under these stones with groups of builders on either side to push and pull the weight of the stones.
* 40 BC - In the remains of a sunken Roman Ship in Lake Nemi. This discovery shows the continual development of the principle. The remains of the ship do not show clear signs of an indication of what these bearings were used for. 
* 17th century - Galileo describes  the functionality of a caged bearing 
* 1740 - John Harrison invented the first caged roller bearing for H3 marine timekeeping.
* 1794 - The first patent for the ball race was given to Phillip Vaughn of Carmarthen, Wales. This is the first design seen with a spherical object moving through a groove. 
* 1869 -Jules Suriray receives the first patent for a radial ball bearing, his design was used by James Moore to win the first 80 mile bicycle race from Paris to Rouen.

== Overall design ==
Design description

Bearings, especially rolling element bearings are designed in similar fashion across the board consisting of the outer and inner track, a central bore, a retainer to keep the rolling elements from clashing into one another or seizing the bearing movement, and the rolling elements themselves.

The internal rolling  components may differ in design due to their intended purpose of application of the bearing.  The main five types of bearings are Ball, Cylindrical, Tapered, Barrel, and Needle.

Ball - the simplest following the basic principles with minimal design intention. Important to note the ability for more seizures is likely due to the freedom of the track design.  

Cylindrical - For single axis movement for straight directional movement. The shape allows for more surface area to be in contact adding in moving more weight with less force at a greater distance.

Tapered -  Primarily focused on the ability to take on axial loading and radial loading and how it does this is by using a conical structure enabling the elements to roll diagonally.

Barrel -  Provides assistance to high radial shock loads that cause misalignment and uses its shape and size for compensation.

Needle - Varying in size, diameters, and materials these types of bearings are best suited for helping reduce weight as well as smaller cross sections application, typically higher load capacity than ball bearings and rigid shaft applications.

== Specific design types ==

===Ball bearing===

A particularly common kind of rolling-element bearing is the ball bearing. The bearing has inner and outer &quot;races&quot; between which balls roll. Each race features a groove usually shaped so the ball fits slightly loose. Thus, in principle, the ball contacts each race across a very narrow area. However, a load on an infinitely small point would cause infinitely high contact pressure. In practice, the ball deforms (flattens) slightly where it contacts each race much as a tire flattens where it contacts the road. The race also yields slightly where each ball presses against it. Thus, the contact between ball and race is of finite size and has finite pressure. The deformed ball and race do not roll entirely smoothly because different parts of the ball are moving at different speeds as it rolls. Thus, there are opposing forces and sliding motions at each ball/race contact. Overall, these cause bearing drag.

===Roller bearings===
====Cylindrical roller====
Roller bearings are the earliest known type of rolling-element-bearing, dating back to at least 40 BC. Common roller bearings use cylinders of slightly greater length than diameter. Roller bearings typically have a higher radial load capacity than ball bearings, but a lower capacity and higher friction under axial loads. If the inner and outer races are misaligned, the bearing capacity often drops quickly compared to either a ball bearing or a spherical roller bearing.

As in all radial bearings, the outer load is continuously re-distributed among the rollers. Often fewer than half of the total number of rollers carry a significant portion of the load. The animation on the right shows how a static radial load is supported by the bearing rollers as the inner ring rotates.

====Spherical roller====

Spherical roller bearings have an outer race with an internal spherical shape. The rollers are thicker in the middle and thinner at the ends. Spherical roller bearings can thus accommodate both static and dynamic misalignment. However, spherical rollers are difficult to produce and thus expensive, and the bearings have higher friction than an ideal cylindrical or tapered roller bearing since there will be a certain amount of sliding between rolling elements and races.
====Gear bearing====

Gear bearings are similar to epicyclic gearing. They consist of a number of smaller &#x27;satellite&#x27; gears which revolve around the center of the bearing along a track on the outsides of the internal and satellite gears, and on the inside of the external gear. The downside to this bearing is manufacturing complexity.
====Tapered roller====

Tapered roller bearings use conical rollers that run on conical races. Most roller bearings only take radial or axial loads, but tapered roller bearings support both radial and axial loads, and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered roller bearings are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered roller bearings are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.
====Needle roller====

The needle roller bearing is a special type of roller bearing which uses long, thin cylindrical rollers resembling needles. Often the ends of the rollers taper to points, and these are used to keep the rollers captive, or they may be hemispherical and not captive but held by the shaft itself or a similar arrangement. Since the rollers are thin, the outside diameter of the bearing is only slightly larger than the hole in the middle. However, the small-diameter rollers must bend sharply where they contact the races, and thus the bearing fatigues relatively quickly.
==== CARB toroidal roller bearings ====
CARB bearings are toroidal roller bearings and similar to spherical roller bearings, but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a spherical roller bearing, their radius of curvature is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a spherical roller bearing. This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, as it can be used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.

Toroidal roller bearings were introduced in 1995 by SKF as &quot;CARB bearings&quot;. The inventor behind the bearing was the engineer Magnus Kellström.

==Configurations==
The configuration of the races determine the types of motions and loads that a bearing can best support. A given configuration can serve multiple of the following types of loading.

===Thrust loadings===

Thrust bearings are used to support axial loads, such as vertical shafts. Common designs are Thrust ball bearings, spherical roller thrust bearings, tapered roller thrust bearings or cylindrical roller thrust bearings. Also non-rolling-element bearings such as hydrostatic or magnetic bearings see some use where particularly heavy loads or low friction is needed.

===Radial loadings===
Rolling-element bearings are often used for axles due to their low rolling friction. For light loads, such as bicycles, ball bearings are often used. For heavy loads and where the loads can greatly change during cornering, such as cars and trucks, tapered rolling bearings are used.

===Linear motion===

Linear motion roller-element bearings are typically designed for either shafts or flat surfaces. Flat surface bearings often consist of rollers and are mounted in a cage, which is then placed between the two flat surfaces; a common example is drawer-support hardware. Roller-element bearing for a shaft use bearing balls in a groove designed to recirculate them from one end to the other as the bearing moves; as such, they are called &quot;linear ball bearings&quot; or &quot;recirculating bearings&quot;.

==Bearing failure==
Rolling-element bearings often work well in non-ideal conditions, but sometimes minor problems cause bearings to fail quickly and mysteriously. For example, with a stationary (non-rotating) load, small vibrations can gradually press out the lubricant between the races and rollers or balls (false brinelling). Without lubricant the bearing fails, even though it is not rotating and thus is apparently not being used. For these sorts of reasons, much of bearing design is about failure analysis. Vibration based analysis can be used for fault identification of bearings.

There are three usual limits to the lifetime or load capacity of a bearing: abrasion, fatigue and pressure-induced welding. 
*Abrasion occurs when the surface is eroded by hard contaminants scraping at the bearing materials. 
*Fatigue results when a material becomes brittle after being repeatedly loaded and released. Where the ball or roller touches the race there is always some deformation, and hence a risk of fatigue. Smaller balls or rollers deform more sharply, and so tend to fatigue faster. 
*Pressure-induced welding can occur when two metal pieces are pressed together at very high pressure and they become one. Although balls, rollers and races may look smooth, they are microscopically rough. Thus, there are high-pressure spots which push away the bearing lubricant. Sometimes, the resulting metal-to-metal contact welds a microscopic part of the ball or roller to the race. As the bearing continues to rotate, the weld is then torn apart, but it may leave race welded to bearing or bearing welded to race.

Although there are many other apparent causes of bearing failure, most can be reduced to these three. For example, a bearing which is run dry of lubricant fails not because it is &quot;without lubricant&quot;, but because lack of lubrication leads to fatigue and welding, and the resulting wear debris can cause abrasion. Similar events occur in false brinelling damage. In high speed applications, the oil flow also reduces the bearing metal temperature by convection. The oil becomes the heat sink for the friction losses generated by the bearing.

ISO has categorised bearing failures into a document Numbered ISO 15243.

=== Life calculation models ===
The life of a rolling bearing is expressed as the number of revolutions or the number of operating hours at a given speed that the bearing is capable of enduring before the first sign of metal fatigue (also known as spalling) occurs on the race of the inner or outer ring, or on a rolling element. Calculating the endurance life of bearings is possible with the help of so-called life models. More specifically, life models are used to determine the bearing size – since this must be sufficient to ensure that the bearing is strong enough to deliver the required life under certain defined operating conditions.

Under controlled laboratory conditions, however, seemingly identical bearings operating under identical conditions can have different individual endurance lives. Thus, bearing life cannot be calculated based on specific bearings, but is instead related to in statistical terms, referring to populations of bearings. All information with regard to load ratings is then based on the life that 90% of a sufficiently large group of apparently identical bearings can be expected to attain or exceed. This gives a clearer definition of the concept of bearing life, which is essential to calculate the correct bearing size. Life models can thus help to predict the performance of a bearing more realistically.

The prediction of bearing life is described in ISO 281 and the ANSI/American Bearing Manufacturers Association Standards 9 and 11.

The traditional life prediction model for rolling-element bearings uses the basic life equation:

formula_1

Where:
* formula_2 is the &#x27;basic life&#x27; (usually quoted in millions of revolutions) for a reliability of 90%, i.e. no more than 10% of bearings are expected to have failed
* formula_3 is the dynamic load rating of the bearing, quoted by the manufacturer
* formula_4 is the equivalent dynamic load applied to the bearing
* formula_5 is a constant: 3 for ball bearings, 4 for pure line contact and 3.33 for roller bearings

Basic life or formula_2 is the life that 90% of bearings can be expected to reach or exceed. The median or average life, sometimes called Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), is about five times the calculated basic rating life.
Several factors, the &#x27;ASME five factor model&#x27;, can be used to further adjust the formula_2 life depending upon the desired reliability, lubrication, contamination, etc.

The major implication of this model is that bearing life is finite, and reduces by a cube power of the ratio between design load and applied load. This model was developed in 1924, 1947 and 1952 work by Arvid Palmgren and Gustaf Lundberg in their paper &quot;Dynamic Capacity of Rolling Bearings&quot;. The model dates from 1924, the values of the constant formula_5 from the post-war works. Higher formula_5 values may be seen as both a longer lifetime for a correctly-used bearing below its design load, or also as the increased rate by which lifetime is shortened when overloaded.

This model was recognised to have become inaccurate for modern bearings. Particularly owing to improvements in the quality of bearing steels, the mechanisms for how failures develop in the 1924 model are no longer as significant. By the 1990s, real bearings were found to give service lives up to 14 times longer than those predicted. An explanation was put forward based on fatigue life; if the bearing was loaded to never exceed the fatigue strength, then the Lundberg-Palmgren mechanism for failure by fatigue would simply never occur. This relied on homogeneous vacuum-melted steels, such as AISI 52100, that avoided the internal inclusions that had previously acted as stress risers within the rolling elements, and also on smoother finishes to bearing tracks that avoided impact loads. The formula_5 constant now had values of 4 for ball and 5 for roller bearings. Provided that load limits were observed, the idea of a &#x27;fatigue limit&#x27; entered bearing lifetime calculations. If the bearing was not loaded beyond this limit, its theoretical lifetime would be limited only by external factors, such as contamination or a failure of lubrication.

A new model of bearing life was put forward by FAG and developed by SKF as the Ioannides-Harris model. ISO 281:2000 first incorporated this model and ISO 281:2007 is based on it.

The concept of fatigue limit, and thus ISO 281:2007, remains controversial, at least in the US.

=== Generalized Bearing Life Model (GBLM) ===
In 2015, the SKF Generalized Bearing Life Model (GBLM) was introduced. In contrast to previous life models, GBLM explicitly separates surface and subsurface failure modes – making the model flexible to accommodate several different failure modes. Modern bearings and applications show fewer failures, but the failures that do occur are more linked to surface stresses. By separating surface from the subsurface, mitigating mechanisms can more easily be identified. GBLM makes use of advanced tribology models to introduce a surface distress failure mode function, obtained from the evaluation of surface fatigue. For the subsurface fatigue, GBLM uses the classical Hertzian rolling contact model. With all this, GBLM includes the effects of lubrication, contamination, and race surface properties, which together influence the stress distribution in the rolling contact.

In 2019, the Generalized Bearing Life Model was relaunched. The updated model offers life calculations also for hybrid bearings, i.e. bearings with steel rings and ceramic (silicon nitride) rolling elements. Even if the 2019 GBLM release was primarily developed to realistically determine the working life of hybrid bearings, the concept can also be used for other products and failure modes.

== Constraints and trade-offs ==
All parts of a bearing are subject to many design constraints. For example, the inner and outer races are often complex shapes, making them difficult to manufacture. Balls and rollers, though simpler in shape, are small; since they bend sharply where they run on the races, the bearings are prone to fatigue. The loads within a bearing assembly are also affected by the speed of operation: rolling-element bearings may spin over 100,000 rpm, and the principal load in such a bearing may be momentum rather than the applied load. Smaller rolling elements are lighter and thus have less momentum, but smaller elements also bend more sharply where they contact the race, causing them to fail more rapidly from fatigue. Maximum rolling-element bearing speeds are often specified in &#x27;nDm&#x27;, which is the product of the mean diameter (in mm) and the maximum RPM. For angular contact bearings nDms over 2.1 million have been found to be reliable in high performance rocketry applications.

There are also many material issues: a harder material may be more durable against abrasion but more likely to suffer fatigue fracture, so the material varies with the application, and while steel is most common for rolling-element bearings, plastics, glass, and ceramics are all in common use. A small defect (irregularity) in the material is often responsible for bearing failure; one of the biggest improvements in the life of common bearings during the second half of the 20th century was the use of more homogeneous materials, rather than better materials or lubricants (though both were also significant). Lubricant properties vary with temperature and load, so the best lubricant varies with application.

Although bearings tend to wear out with use, designers can make tradeoffs of bearing size and cost versus lifetime. A bearing can last indefinitely—longer than the rest of the machine—if it is kept cool, clean, lubricated, is run within the rated load, and if the bearing materials are sufficiently free of microscopic defects. Cooling, lubrication, and sealing are thus important parts of the bearing design.

The needed bearing lifetime also varies with the application. For example, Tedric A. Harris reports in his &quot;Rolling Bearing Analysis&quot; on an oxygen pump bearing in the U.S. Space Shuttle which could not be adequately isolated from the liquid oxygen being pumped. All lubricants reacted with the oxygen, leading to fires and other failures. The solution was to lubricate the bearing with the oxygen. Although liquid oxygen is a poor lubricant, it was adequate, since the service life of the pump was just a few hours.

The operating environment and service needs are also important design considerations. Some bearing assemblies require routine addition of lubricants, while others are factory sealed, requiring no further maintenance for the life of the mechanical assembly. Although seals are appealing, they increase friction, and in a permanently sealed bearing the lubricant may become contaminated by hard particles, such as steel chips from the race or bearing, sand, or grit that gets past the seal. Contamination in the lubricant is abrasive and greatly reduces the operating life of the bearing assembly. Another major cause of bearing failure is the presence of water in the lubrication oil. Online water-in-oil monitors have been introduced in recent years to monitor the effects of both particles and the presence of water in oil and their combined effect.

==Designation==
Metric rolling-element bearings have alphanumerical designations, defined by ISO 15, to define all of the physical parameters. The main designation is a seven digit number with optional alphanumeric digits before or after to define additional parameters. Here the digits will be defined as: 7654321. Any zeros to the left of the last defined digit are not printed; e.g. a designation of 0007208 is printed 7208.

Digits one and two together are used to define the inner diameter (ID), or bore diameter, of the bearing. For diameters between 20 and 495 mm, inclusive, the designation is multiplied by five to give the ID; e.g. designation 08 is a 40 mm ID. For inner diameters less than 20 the following designations are used: 00 = 10 mm ID, 01 = 12 mm ID, 02 = 15 mm ID, and 03 = 17 mm ID. The third digit defines the &quot;diameter series&quot;, which defines the outer diameter (OD). The diameter series, defined in ascending order, is: 0, 8, 9, 1, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The fourth digit defines the type of bearing:

The fifth and sixth digit define structural modifications to the bearing. For example, on radial thrust bearings the digits define the contact angle, or the presence of seals on any bearing type. The seventh digit defines the &quot;width series&quot;, or thickness, of the bearing. The width series, defined from lightest to heaviest, is: 7, 8, 9, 0, 1 (extra light series), 2 (light series), 3 (medium series), 4 (heavy series). The third digit and the seventh digit define the &quot;dimensional series&quot; of the bearing.

There are four optional prefix characters, here defined as A321-XXXXXXX (where the X&#x27;s are the main designation), which are separated from the main designation with a dash. The first character, A, is the bearing class, which is defined, in ascending order: C, B, A. The class defines extra requirements for vibration, deviations in shape, the rolling surface tolerances, and other parameters that are not defined by a designation character. The second character is the frictional moment (friction), which is defined, in ascending order, by a number 1–9. The third character is the radial clearance, which is normally defined by a number between 0 and 9 (inclusive), in ascending order, however for radial-thrust bearings it is defined by a number between 1 and 3, inclusive. The fourth character is the accuracy ratings, which normally are, in ascending order: 0 (normal), 6X, 6, 5, 4, T, and 2. Ratings 0 and 6 are the most common; ratings 5 and 4 are used in high-speed applications; and rating 2 is used in gyroscopes. For tapered bearings, the values are, in ascending order: 0, N, and X, where 0 is 0, N is &quot;normal&quot;, and X is 6X.

There are five optional characters that can defined after the main designation: A, E, P, C, and T; these are tacked directly onto the end of the main designation. Unlike the prefix, not all of the designations must be defined. &quot;A&quot; indicates an increased dynamic load rating. &quot;E&quot; indicates the use of a plastic cage. &quot;P&quot; indicates that heat-resistant steel are used. &quot;C&quot; indicates the type of lubricant used (C1–C28). &quot;T&quot; indicates the degree to which the bearing components have been tempered (T1–T5).

While manufacturers follow ISO 15 for part number designations on some of their products, it is common for them to implement proprietary part number systems that do not correlate to ISO 15.

<text>Castlebar () is the county town of County Mayo, Ireland. Developing around a 13th-century castle of the de Barry family, from which the town got its name, the town now acts as a social and economic focal point for the surrounding hinterland. With a population of 13,054 in the 2022 census (up from 7,648 in the 1991 census), Castlebar was one of the fastest growing towns in Ireland in the early 21st century.

A campus of Atlantic Technological University and the Country Life section of the National Museum are two important facilities in the area. The town is linked by railway to Dublin, Westport and Ballina. The main route by road is the N5.

==History==

The modern town grew up as a settlement around the de Barry castle, which was built by a Norman adventurer in 1235 and was later the site of an English garrison. The castle was located at the end of Castle Street, where the town river is thought to have originally flowed.

The town was granted a charter of incorporation in 1613 by James I of England. Under the charter the town had a portreeve (mayor) and a fifteen-member corporation and was entitled to elect two members to the Parliament of Ireland. The Linen Hall, established as a clearing house for local linen materials, was completed in 1790.

Armed conflict has been the centrepiece of the town&#x27;s historical heritage. French forces under the command of General Jean Humbert aided in a rout of the British garrison in the town during the failed Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was so comprehensive it would later be known as &quot;The Races of Castlebar&quot;. A short-lived provisional Irish Republic had been declared upon General Humbert&#x27;s arrival at Killala. Following the victory at Castlebar John Moore, head of the Mayo United Irishmen and the brother of a local landowner, was declared president of the Province of Connacht. His remains are today interred in a corner of the town green, known as the Mall, previously the cricket grounds of Lord Lucan, whose family (the Binghams) have owned and still own large tracts of the town and county.

Castlebar Military Barracks was established in 1834: it was finally closed in March 2012 and the buildings and grounds have been purchased by the local town and county councils.

The Irish National Land League was founded by Michael Davitt, of Straide in County Mayo, at the Imperial Hotel in Castlebar on 21 October 1879.

==Coat of arms==
The name of the town comes from the castle built in about 1235 (see above). This castle is depicted as part of the town&#x27;s coat of arms, with two yew trees on either side because Castlebar is the county town of Mayo (). The crosses represent the parish of Aglish (the official name of the parish of Castlebar). The 1798 &#x27;Races of Castlebar&#x27; is commemorated by pikes. Underneath are the words &#x27;Ar Aghaidh&#x27;, meaning &#x27;forward&#x27;.

==Demographics==
Castlebar expanded rapidly during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Castlebar&#x27;s population grew in the late 1990s, rising by one-third in the six years between the 1996 and 2002 census. According to the 2016 census, the population stood at 12,068, a threefold increase in the 90 years since 1926, when the population was 4,256.

==Culture==

Castlebar is the location for important festivals and traditions, among which is the International Four Days&#x27; Walk. A well-established blues music festival in venues across the town took place for many years on the weekend before the first Monday in June, but has not taken place since 2011. During the 1970s and 1980s the town hosted the International Castlebar Song Contest which was televised nationally on RTÉ. The Museum of Country Life is located on the outskirts of Castlebar, and is the only branch of the National Museum of Ireland located outside Dublin.

Castlebar is home to the Linenhall Arts Centre, which exhibits visual art throughout the year, as well as hosting live drama and music performances. The Royal Theatre and Event Centre has capacity of 2,200 people fully seated or 4,000 people standing. hosts larger-scale productions and popular music concerts.

There are Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland (Anglican), Elim Pentecostal, and evangelical (Calvary Church Castlebar) churches in the town. A mosque was opened in October 2023.

One of the oldest pubs in Castlebar is John McHale&#x27;s pub, located on New Line. The pub is known for its sale of a &quot;Meejum&quot; of Guinness, which is slightly less than a pint. It once had &#x27;the best pint of Guinness in Ireland&#x27; according to a national tabloid.

==Economy==

Castlebar is home to the health care company Baxter Healthcare and manufacturer Fort Wayne Metals.
==Transport==
===Road===

Castlebar is served by the N5 national primary road and the N60 and N84 national secondary roads. In 1990 a relief road was built around Castlebar, removing through traffic on the N5 from the main street. This road is a basic two-lane road. It suffers from chronic congestion, particularly in the summer months when thousands of tourists have to negotiate the bottleneck en route to neighbouring Westport and Achill Island. A bypass of Castlebar of dual-carriageway standard was approved by An Bórd Pleanala in July 2014, and construction began in late 2019. It was completed in 2023.

<doc id="627565" wikidata="Q379960" url="?curid=627565" title="Driss Chraïbi">
<text>Driss Chraïbi (; July 15, 1926 – April 1, 2007) was a Moroccan author whose novels deal with colonialism, culture clashes, generational conflict and the treatment of women and are often perceived as semi-autobiographical.

Born in El Jadida and educated in Casablanca, Chraïbi went to Paris in 1945 to study chemistry before turning to literature and journalism. His works have been translated into English, Arabic, Italian, German and Russian. He viewed himself as an anarchist, writing on issues such as immigration, patriarchy and the relation between the west and the Arab world

== Life ==
Driss Chraïbi was born to a merchant family in French Morocco but was later raised in Casablanca. He attended the Koranic school before joining the M&#x27;hammed Guessous School in Rabat, followed by the Lycée Lyautey in Casablanca. In 1945 he went to university in Paris, where, in 1950, he earned a degree in chemical engineering. After obtaining his degree, he abandoned science before the doctorate. Instead, he earned his living from a string of odd jobs, before turning to literature and journalism. He produced programmes for France Culture, frequented poets, taught Maghrebian literature at Laval University in Quebec and devoted himself to writing. In 1955, he married Catherine Birckel, with whom he had five children. In 1978, he remarried with Sheena McCallion, a Scotswoman, with whom he also had five children.

He became known through his first two novels, &quot;Le passé simple&quot; (1954), whose depiction of a young man&#x27;s revolt against traditional society generated controversy in Morocco during its struggle for independence, and its counterpoint &quot;Les boucs&quot; (1955) a ferocious attack on the treatment of North African immigrants in France.

A page turns with the death of his father in 1957. The writer, in exile in France, went beyond the revolt against his father and established a new dialogue with him beyond the grave in &quot;Succession ouverte&quot; ( 1962), translated as &quot;Heirs to the Past&quot;. 

He died in Drôme, France., where he had lived since 1988, and was buried in the Shuhada Cemetery, Casablanca, Morocco, near his father&#x27;s grave, thus fulfilling his last wishes. He took with him to the hereafter the secret of the last book he was working on.

== Literature ==
Driss Chraïbi was a Moroccan author, he published a number of novels which were written prior to and after Moroccos independence from colonial rule. As a result of this, his works were faced with extreme controversy with some going as far as to name him a traitor. His works often were based on the political events and can be used as a symbol of resistance to the French. 

Chraïbi&#x27;s most famous work was his debut novel &quot;Le Passé simple&quot;, published in 1954 at the heart of the fight for independence. This work was considered the most controversial work of the &quot;Generation of 52&quot; and in turn was faced with heavy criticism and even threatened with death by the Parti Démocrate de l&quot;Indépendance (PDI). This controversy was because, unlike other Moroccan authors of the time, this novel attacked the Moroccan patriarchal society as much as it attacked the French colonial rule. Whilst Chraïbi denies the fact that the main character is himself, there are several parallel between the two. The novel explores the theme of identity as the protagonist struggles between his Moroccan heritage and the French colonial impact and education. Importantly is written 2 years before Morocco gain independence, therefore was at the height of the struggle for independence. 

&quot;La Civilization ma mère&quot; was another one of his novels, published in 1972 then later translated into English as &quot;Mother comes of Age&quot; which was published in 1984. It portrays the role of Arab women whose role in society is restricted to that of wife and mother. However, the novel is not limited to this, the novel has a powerful message for women&#x27;s rights as the mother gains political, economic and social knowledge as she urges her sons. Then, she becomes a powerful spokesperson and an educator.

Chraïbi&#x27;s later works provide more reflective views. An example of this is in his novel &quot;The World Next Door&quot; . Despite criticism of the west, particularly their colonial rule, throughout his novels he still understands the benefits of the freedom allowed in the west. For authors like him, there is complete freedom to publish and contest in western countries, something he knows is beneficial. Chraïbi&#x27;s works were supported by former French President François Mitterrand who had personally thanked him for writing in French.

== Awards ==
He was awarded the Prix de l’Afrique Méditerranéenne in 1973, the Franco-Arab Friendship Award in 1981. and the Mondello prize for the translation of &quot;Naissance à l&#x27;aube&quot; in Italy.

<text>Slains Castle, also known as New Slains Castle to distinguish it from the nearby Old Slains Castle, is a ruined castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It overlooks the North Sea from its cliff-top site east of Cruden Bay. 

The core of the castle is a 16th-century tower house, built by the 9th Earl of Erroll. Significant reconstruction of the castle has been carried out a number of times, lastly in 1837 when it was rebuilt as a Scots Baronial mansion. At one time it had three extensive gardens but is now a roofless ruin. Plans to restore the castle have been on hold since 2009. It is a Historic Environment Scotland Category B listed building. The castle is mentioned in two locally set novels written by Bram Stoker, &quot;The Watter&#x27;s Mou&#x27;&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of the Sea&quot;. Tentative links have also been made between the castle and his novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, although it is an internet myth that he got the idea for his famous novel on seeing Slains Castle for the first time.

==History==
New Slains Castle was the home of the Earl of Erroll, a hereditary title within the Hay family. The Hays had been a powerful dynasty in the area since the 14th century and owned large tracts of land in eastern Aberdeenshire, notably the parishes of Slains and Cruden. In 1453 Sir William Hay was made the first Earl of Erroll by King James II. At this time the local seat of power was Old Slains Castle, near Collieston, some southwest.

The first building on the site of New Slains Castle was constructed for Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll, following the destruction of the original Slains Castle. Named Bowness, it was located on a sea cliff close to what is now the village of Cruden Bay.

Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll, a convert to Roman Catholicism, had conspired with other Catholic nobles, including the Earl of Huntly, with whom he joined in a brief rebellion in 1589. Erroll was also a signatory of the &quot;Spanish Blanks&quot;, documents signed by members of the Catholic nobility of Scotland, and otherwise left to be filled in with the terms of Spanish aid. Erroll was declared a traitor in 1594, and Old Slains Castle was destroyed in October on the orders of King James VI.

After a period abroad Erroll returned to Scotland, and abjured Roman Catholicism in 1597, subsequently returning to royal favour. He abandoned Old Slains and built a courtyard and square tower on the present site, probably around 1600, although the exact date is not known. The earliest mention of the tower was made in a gazetteer published in 1660. Another document from 1732 specifically mentions that Bowness was built from new ‘by Francis, Earl of Erroll, on the king&#x27;s demolishing the original castle of Slains’. The name &#x27;Bowness&#x27; derives from a double rock arch at the north end of the peninsula, thought to resemble a bow. 

The original building was added to in 1664, when the wings around the courtyard were extended by the addition of a gallery or corridor, and was renamed New Slains Castle. In 1707 the entrance front was renewed.

New Slains Castle is linked to the Jacobite cause in Scotland. Three Jacobite Countesses of Erroll, residents of New Slains Castle: Lady Catherine Carnegie, Lady Anne Drummond (&#x27;Anne Erroll&#x27;), and Lady Mary Hay, 14th Countess of Erroll.

Lady Catherine Carnegie, married to Gilbert Hay, 11th Earl of Erroll, took part in the Jacobite rising of 1689. She arranged for letters to be smuggled in and out of Edinburgh Castle during the siege of 1689, including letters forwarded to her by King James II / VII. And later, John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee, contrived to have her arrested with a bogus letter from King James, purporting that an army from Ireland intended to land in South West Scotland. The intended diversion turned out to be pointless. Let free, and then arrested a second time with a letter from King James, Catherine eventually escaped to France, where she was made the Governess of the infant James Francis Edward Stuart. 

In 1705, Louis XIV, King of France, who was at war with England and Scotland, sent secret agent Nathaniel Hooke to foment a Jacobite Rebellion in Scotland. Hooke landed at New Slains Castle, having been brought from Dunkirk by the fourteen-gun French navy frigate, &quot;Audacious.&quot; He was met there by lady Anne Drummond. His efforts came to nothing after they were thwarted by James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton, head of the Country Party in the Scottish Parliament.

Hooke returned to New Slains Castle in 1707, the year of the formation of the United Kingdom. Using the castle as his base, he toured Scotland gathering military intelligence to establish the feasibility of a combined French / Jacobite invasion of Scotland. He returned to France, where his report was read to Louis XIV at the Palace of Versailles. The French King authorised the invasion.

The planned French invasion of Britain (the objective was Scotland) was launched in 1708. Between 5,000 and 6000 men, both French and Jacobite, sailed from Dunkirk in 28 ships with James Edward Stuart on board the flagship. The fleet eventually reached the Firth of Forth, where the intention had been to disembark the invasion army together with James Edward Stuart at Leith. However, fifty ships from the newly formed British navy now arrived to chase the invasion fleet out of the Forth and up the northeast coast of Scotland. Discussion took place about landing James Edward Stuart at an unspecified Aberdeenshire castle, plausibly New Slains Castle, although the French admiral of the fleet refused to allow this to happen. The invasion was abandoned, and the fleet returned to Dunkirk. Mary Hay, 14th Countess of Erroll recruited men from Aberdeenshire during the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. When she died childless in 1758, the Earl of Erroll title passed to her great-nephew, James, Lord Boyd. James was the grandson of her sister, Lady Margaret Hay and the son of William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock, who was executed on Tower Hill in 1746. James, Lord Boyd changed his name to Hay. The Kilmarnock title survived in part down the succession, whereby, up until recently, the heir to the Erroll earldom was referred to as Lord Kilmarnock.

Samuel Johnson and James Boswell visited New Slains Castle in 1773. They were entertained by James, Lord Boyd (Hay) and his brother Charles. They spent a night in the castle, although James Boswell did not sleep well: I had a most elegant room. But there was a fire in it which blazed, and the sea, to which my windows looked, roared, and the pillows were made of some sea-fowl’s feathers which had to me a disagreeable smell. So that by all these causes, I was kept awake a good time. I began to think that Lord Kilmarnock might appear to me [beheaded in 1746], and I was somewhat dreary. But the thought did not last long, and I fell asleep.Neither Johnson or Boswell mention that the earl and his brother had fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Culloden in 1746; The earl with the government army, and his brother Charles (and his father) with the Jacobite army.

In 1820 William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll, married Lady Elizabeth FitzClarence, the illegitimate daughter of King William IV and Dorothea Jordan. In the 1830s the 18th Earl commissioned the Aberdeen architect John Smith to remodel the castle. This resulted in a virtual rebuilding of Slains in a Scots Baronial style, including granite facings, in 1836–1837. Gardens were laid out in the late 1890s by the landscape architect T. H. Mawson.

=== Bram Stoker and &quot;Dracula&quot; ===
Slains Castle is associated with the author Bram Stoker, who was a regular visitor to nearby Cruden Bay between 1892 and 1910. The castle is mentioned in his locally set novels, &quot;The Watter&#x27;s Mou&#x27;&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of the Sea&quot;: At first the cleft runs from west to east, and broadens out into a wide bay of which one side a steep grassy slope leads towards the new castle of Slains...’ &quot;The Watter’s Mou’.&quot;

My own section for watching was between Slains Castle and Dunbuy, as wild and rocky a bit of coast as anyone could wish to see. Behind Slains runs in a long narrow inlet with beetling cliffs, sheer on either side, and at its entrance a wild turmoil of rocks are hurled together in titanic confusion. &quot;The Mystery of the Sea&quot;.The castle may have provided the inspiration for Kyllion Castle in &quot;The Jewel of Seven Stars -&quot; a mansion house on the edge of a cliff. 

Slains Castle is commonly linked with &quot;Dracula&quot;, although the claim, often seen on the internet, that Slains Castle inspired &quot;Dracula&quot; when Bram Stoker saw Slains Castle for the first time is a myth&quot;.&quot; The earliest entry in Bram Stoker&#x27;s written notes for &quot;Dracula&quot; dates from 1890, two years before Bram&#x27;s first visit to Cruden Bay. They mention that the novel will include a castle setting, although at this time no specific castle has yet been identified.

Although New Slains Castle did not inspire the plot for &quot;Dracula&quot;, it is feasible that it provided a visual palette for Bram Stoker when he started writing the book in Cruden Bay in 1895. And a distinctive room in New Slains Castle, the octagonal hall, may be the source for the octagonal room in &quot;Dracula&quot;.‘The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.’ &quot;Dracula&quot;.

===Later History===

Shortly before 1900, Charles Hay, 20th Earl of Erroll, became an occasional visitor to the castle, spending most of his time in England. New Slains Castle was rented out as a high-class summer holiday residence, notably to Robert Baden-Powell in 1900, and Prime Minister H. H. Asquith in 1903 and 1908. Winston Churchill spent two nights at the castle in 1908 as a guest of H. H. Asquith. 

In 1916 the 20th Earl of Erroll sold New Slains, ending more than 300 years of occupation by the family. He had been impoverished by the lavish spending of the family fortune by his ancestors, an agricultural recession starting from the 1890s, and inheritance taxes. It was purchased by Sir John Ellerman, the wealthy but secretive owner of the Ellerman Lines shipping company, who never visited the castle. It was put up for sale again in 1922 and bought by Percy P. Harvey from London who then disposed of the land, although the castle remained unsold.

The castle was then bought by Charles Brand Ltd, a Dundee-based demolition company who specialised in buying Scottish castle and mansions for demolition, and then making money from selling off masonry and other fittings.

The demolition went ahead in the summer of 1925. An advert headlined ‘Demolition of Slains Castle’ in the &quot;Aberdeen Press and Journal&quot;, 5 September 1925, listed various items for sale: ‘Battens, Flooring, sarking, slates, doors, windows, baths, wash hand basins, sinks, stable fittings, stone paving and other building materials’.

Perhaps this had not gone well, because a new advert appeared notifying a sale at the castle on Saturday 17 April 1926. Now included in the inventory were the following: panel doors (yellow pine), water closets, bedroom grates, granite sills and corners.

It is often stated that the roof of New Slains Castle was removed to avoid paying taxes, although it is not clear what happened. One hypothesis is that the roof was removed by the demolition company to recover lead and slates for resale.

New Slains Castle is now a roofless shell, with most of the outer and inner walls standing to full height. In 2004 it was reported that the Slains Partnership was preparing plans for the restoration of the building and conversion into 35 holiday apartments. In August 2007 the scheme was granted outline planning permission by Aberdeenshire Council, but the plans were put on hold in 2009 due to the Great Recession.

==Architecture==

New Slains Castle is a Historic Environment Scotland Category B listed building.
At first inspection, the ruin appears to be a blend of several different architectural styles and periods, due to diverse masonry including older mortared granite, mortared medieval red brick, mortared sandstone and newer well-faced granite. In fact, most of the architecture seems to derive from a rather cohesive interval 1597 to 1664, which construction is the most expansive and includes the mortared rough granite and medieval brick. The 1836 work adds smoother granite facing that contrasts with the older construction style.

The defensive works of the castle include the use of the North Sea cliffs; an abyss to the west that functions as a deep impassable moat; and a ruined rampart that would have been the main entrance on the south. The ruins include reasonably well-preserved elements of three- and four-storey structural elements and a basement course over some of the range, especially at the eastern side. There are well-preserved basement kitchen works with numerous fire pits and masonry indented storage spaces. The internal doorways are primarily of well-preserved wooden lintel construction, with numerous examples of mortared sandstone and medieval brickwork archways. The interior of the ground level is a maze of passageways and smaller rooms, reflecting a high state of occupancy in 17th-century times.

==Legends==
The castle is claimed is to be haunted by the spirit of Victor Hay, 21st Earl of Erroll. However, this is an internet myth, probably due to a misunderstanding. Victor Hay, using his courtesy title of Lord Kilmarnock, wrote a novel, &quot;Ferelith,&quot; about a ghost in a Slains Castle look-alike called Gowrie Castle. The ghost of Lord Gowrie gets the (living) Lady Ferelith pregnant. A daughter is born and Lady Ferelith dies in childbirth.

<text>Allen Walker Read (June 2, 1906 – October 16, 2002) was an American etymologist and lexicographer. Born in Minnesota, he spent much of his career as a professor at Columbia University in New York. Read&#x27;s work &quot;Classic American Graffiti&quot; is well regarded in the study of latrinalia and obscenity. His etymological career included his discovery of the origin of the word &quot;OK&quot;, a longtime puzzle, and his scholarly study of the history and use of the common English vulgarity &quot;fuck.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Read was born in Winnebago, Minnesota to Orlan and Bessie Allen Reed on 2 June, 1906. He had one sibling, a sister, Mary Jo; she became a professor of geography at Eastern Illinois University. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Northern Iowa (called Iowa State Teachers College at the time) in 1925 and a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Iowa in 1926. His thesis focused on Iowa place names. Read studied at St Edmund Hall, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar from 1928 to 1931. 

== Career ==
He became a professor at the University of Chicago beginning in 1931, working on William Craigie&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of American English&quot;. Read&#x27;s 1934 article in &quot;American Speech&quot;, titled &quot;An Obscenity Symbol&quot;, is a study of the word &quot;fuck&quot; from a sociological perspective. In 2014, Jesse Sheidlower, the president of the American Dialect Society, called it &quot;the most important article&quot; written about the term, noting that ironically, Read&#x27;s 14-page essay avoided using the word directly, referring to it euphemistically instead. 

=== &quot;Classic American Graffiti&quot; ===
Read&#x27;s first extended work, &quot;Lexical Evidence from Folk Epigraphy in Western North America: A Glossarial Study of the Low Element in the English Vocabulary&quot;, describes and collates examples of bathroom graffiti observed by Reade on a road trip throughout the Western United States in 1928&quot;.&quot; The book was privately published at his own expense in Paris in 1935, since its extensive inclusion of vulgarity was considered too obscene by American publishers. Even then, the printing was limited to 75 copies and contained a disclaimer that it should be &quot;restricted to students of linguistics, folk-lore... and allied branches of social science.&quot; Read wrote in a foreword:Judged merely as reading matter, the following work (apart from the Introduction) is abominably, incredibly obscene, and the compiler begs that any one will lay this book down who is not prepared to look at all social phenomenon with the dispassionate eye of the anthropologist and the student of abnormal psychology.It was eventually published in the United States in 1977, under the title &quot;Classic American Graffiti&quot;, , by Reinhold Aman&#x27;s Maledicta Press. The work was described as a prototypical &quot;model study&quot; of latrinalia that &quot;deserves the attention of any serious student of American language&quot; in a 1979 review, which noted that even then it remained hard to access and &quot;excessively rare.&quot; It contains some of the earliest documentation in English of words used by the homosexual community, although Read never recorded the word &quot;gay&quot;, implying that the term was not used to mean homosexual during this time period. The work also contained Read&#x27;s concept of the &quot;inverted taboo&quot;, in which some people delight in vulgarity because of its illicit nature.

=== Other work ===
From 1938 onwards, he worked intermittently on a dictionary of Britishisms, but was never able to complete it during his life. During World War II, he did his service with the Military Intelligence Division, working on the &quot;American Military Definition Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Military Phrase Books.&quot; He was a chaired professor at Columbia University in New York City from 1945 until 1974. In 1948, H.L. Mencken wrote that Read &quot;probably knows more about early Americanisms than anyone else on earth.&quot;

The origin of &quot;OK&quot;, one of the most common English words, had been considered one of English&#x27;s biggest etymological mysteries, with a number of competing theories. Read unveiled the actual origin of the word in a series of articles published in &quot;American Speech&quot; between 1963 and 1964. This achievement was described as &quot;the pinnacle of his career&quot; to &quot;envious fellow etymologists&quot; by &quot;The Economist&quot;, but Read considered it just &quot;an agreeable diversion from his main work.&quot; 

Read also successfully traced the origins of the words &quot;dixie&quot; and &quot;podunk&quot;, and managed to attribute the first use of &quot;the almighty dollar&quot; to Washington Irving. He wrote the entry for &quot;dictionary&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;. Read&#x27;s career included studies of euphemisms, graffiti, slang, pig Latin, doubletalk, and adult baby talk. He also had a professional interest in folklore and place names; he was a founder of the American Names Society and served as its president in 1969. 

Read served as the head of the International Linguistic Association, and also as the President of the Semiotic Society of America in 1980. In 1987, Read turned over his work on Britishisms, consisting of more than 100,000 citations, to John Algeo for completion. At an advanced age, Read finally completed his doctorate at Oxford, receiving a D.Litt in 1988.

== Personal life ==
A colleague described Read as &quot;never a snob, never old-fashioned&quot;, and wrote that Read embraced language in all its multifariousness, opining that &quot;language is culture itself.&quot; He married Charlotte Schuchardt, director of the Institute of General Semantics, in 1953. The couple tended to combine academic conferences with opportunities for hiking and mountain climbing. They had no children, and remained together until she died on 15 July 2002. Read died in New York City on 16 October 2002.

<text>The Basmachi movement (, derived from ) was an uprising against Imperial Russian and Soviet rule in Central Asia by rebel groups inspired by Islamic beliefs.

The movement&#x27;s roots lay in the anti-conscription violence of 1916 which erupted when the Russian Empire began to draft Muslims for army service in World War I. In the months following the October 1917 Revolution, the Bolsheviks seized power in many parts of the Russian Empire and the Russian Civil War began. Turkestani Muslim political movements attempted to form an autonomous government in the city of Kokand, in the Fergana Valley. The Bolsheviks launched an assault on Kokand in February 1918 and carried out a general massacre of up to 25,000 people. The massacre rallied support to the Basmachi who waged a guerrilla and conventional war that seized control of large parts of the Fergana Valley and much of Turkestan. The group&#x27;s notable leaders were Enver Pasha and, later, Ibrahim Bek.

The fortunes of the movement fluctuated throughout the early 1920s, but by 1923 the Red Army&#x27;s extensive campaigns had dealt the Basmachis many defeats. After major Red Army campaigns and concessions regarding economic and Islamic practices in the mid-1920s, the military fortunes and popular support of the Basmachi declined. Resistance to Soviet leadership did flare up again, to a lesser extent, in response to collectivization campaigns in the pre-WWII era.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Basmachi&quot; is of Uzbek origin and means &quot;bandit&quot; or &quot;robber&quot; which probably derived from &quot;baskinji&quot; meaning &quot;attacker&quot;. The Russians used the term for the Central Asian resistance fighters, and it was widely used throughout the region to denote them, in an attempt to persuade the public that the fighters were no more than criminals.

==Background==

Prior to World War I, Russian Turkestan was ruled from Tashkent as a Krai or Governor-Generalship. To the east of Tashkent, the Ferghana Valley was an ethnically diverse, densely populated region that was divided between settled farmers (often called Sarts) and nomads (mostly Kyrgyz). Under Russian rule, it was converted into a major cotton-growing region. The resulting economic development brought some small-scale industry to the region, but several scholars suggest that native shop workers were worse off than their Russian counterparts, and the new wealth from cotton was spread unevenly; many farmers became indebted. Many criminals organized into bands, forming the basis for the early Basmachi movement when it began in the Ferghana Valley.

Cotton price-fixing during the First World War made matters worse, and a large, landless rural proletariat soon developed. Muslim clergy decried the gambling and alcoholism that became commonplace, and crime rose considerably.

Major violence in Russian Turkestan broke out in 1916, when the Tsarist government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service. This caused the Central Asian revolt of 1916, centered in modern-day Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which was put down by martial law. Tensions between Central Asians (especially Kazakhs) and Russian settlers led to large-scale massacres on both sides. Thousands died, and hundreds of thousands fled, most into the neighbouring Republic of China. The Central Asian revolt of 1916 was the first anti-Russian incident on a mass scale in Central Asia, and it set the stage for native resistance after the fall of Tsar Nicholas II in the following year.

The suppression of the rebellion was a deliberate campaign of annihilation against the Kazakh and Kyrgyz tribes on the part of the Russian soldiers and settlers. Hundreds of thousands of Kazakh and Kyrgyz people were killed or expelled. The ethnic cleansing had its roots in the Tsarist government policy of ethnic homogenization.

==Conflict==
===Kokand autonomy and the start of hostilities===

In the aftermath of the February Revolution of 1917, Muslim political forces began to organize. Members of the All-Russian Muslim council formed the &quot;Shura-i Islam&quot; (Islamic Council), a Jadidist body that sought a federated, democratic state with autonomy for Muslims. More conservative religious scholars formed the &quot;Ulema Jemyeti&quot; (Board of Learned Men), more concerned with safeguarding Islamic institutions and Sharia law. Together, these Muslim nationalists formed a coalition, but it fell apart after the October Revolution, when the Jadids lent their support to the Bolsheviks who had seized power. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers&#x27; and Workers&#x27; Deputies, an organization dominated by Russian railway workers and colonial proletarians, rejected Muslim participation in government. Stung by this apparent reaffirmation of colonial rule, the &quot;Shura-i Islam&quot; reunited with &quot;Ulema Jemyeti&quot; to form the Kokand Autonomous Government. This was to be the nucleus of an autonomous state in Turkestan, governed by Sharia law.
The Tashkent Soviet initially recognized the authority of Kokand, but restricted its jurisdiction to the Muslim old section of Tashkent, and demanded the final say in regional affairs. After violent riots in Tashkent, relations broke down, and despite the leftist leanings of many of its members, Kokand aligned itself with the Whites. Politically and militarily weak, the Muslim government began looking around for protection. To this end, a band of armed robbers led by Irgash Bey were amnestied and recruited to defend Kokand. This force, however, was unable to resist an attack on Kokand by the forces of the Tashkent Soviet. In February, 1918 the Red Army soldiers thoroughly pillaged Kokand, and carried out what was described as a &quot;pogrom&quot;, in which as many as 25,000 people died. This massacre, along with the execution of many Ferghana peasants who were suspected of hoarding cotton and food, incensed the Muslim population. Irgash Bey took up arms against the Soviets, declaring himself &quot;Supreme Leader of the Islamic Army&quot;, and the Basmachi rebellion started in earnest.
Meanwhile, Soviet troops temporarily deposed Emir Sayeed Alim Khan of Bukhara in favor of the leftist Young Bukharans faction led by Fayzulla Xoʻjayev. Russian troops were repulsed by the Bukharan populace after a period of looting, and the Emir retained his throne for the time-being. In the Khanate of Khiva, Basmachi leader Junaid Khan overthrew the Russian puppet and suppressed the modernizing movement of the leftist Young Khivans.

===First phase of the revolt in the Ferghana Valley===
Irgash Bey&#x27;s claims to leadership of an army of the faithful won recognition by the clergy of the Ferghana Valley, and he soon controlled a sizable fighting force. Widespread nationalization campaigns carried out from Tashkent had caused economic collapse, and the Ferghana Valley faced famine in absence of grain imports. All these factors drove people to join the Basmachi. The Tashkent Soviet was unable to contain the insurgency, and the end of 1918 decentralized bands of fighters, totaling roughly 20,000, controlled Ferghana and the countryside surrounding Tashkent. Irgash Bey faced rival commanders such as Madamin Bey, who was supported by more moderate Muslim factions, but he secured formal, nominal leadership of the movement at a council in March 1919.

With the Tashkent Soviet in a vulnerable military position, the Bolsheviks left Russian settlers to organize their own defense by creating the Peasant Army of Fergana. This often involved brutal reprisals for Basmachi attacks by Soviet forces and Russian farmers both. The harsh policies of War Communism, however, caused the peasants&#x27; army to sour on the Tashkent Soviet. In May 1919, Madamin Bey formed an alliance with the settlers, entailing a non-aggression pact and a coalition army. The new allies made plans for establishing a joint Russian-Muslim state, with power sharing arrangements and cultural rights for both groups. Disputes over the Islamic orientation of the Basmachi led to the break-up of the alliance, however, and both Madamin and the settlers suffered defeats at the hands of the Muslim Volga Tatar Red Brigade. The inhabitants of the Ferghana Valley were exhausted after the punishing winter of 1919–20, and Madamin Bey defected to the Soviet side in March. Meanwhile, famine relief reached the region under the more moderate New Economic Policy, while land reform and amnesty placated Ferghana residents. As a result, the Basmachi movement lost control of most populated areas and shrank overall.

The pacification of Ferghana did not last long. During the summer of 1920 the Soviets felt secure enough to requisition food and mobilize Muslim conscripts. The result was a renewed uprising and new Basmachi groups proliferated, fueled by religious slogans. Renewed conflict would see the Basmachi movement spread across Turkestan.

===Basmachi in Khiva and Bukhara===
In January 1920, the Red Army captured Khiva and set up a Young Khivan provisional government. Junaid Khan fled into the desert with his followers, and the Basmachi movement in the Khorezm Region was born. Before the end of the year, the Soviets deposed the Young Khivans government, and the Muslim nationalists fled to join Junaid, strengthening his forces considerably.

In August of that year, the Emir of Bukhara was finally deposed when the Red Army conquered Bukhara. From exile in Afghanistan, the Emir directed the Bokhara Basmachi movement, supported by the angry populace and clergy. Fighters operated on behalf of the Emir and were under the command of Ibrahim Bey, a tribal leader. Basmachi forces operated with success in both Khiva and Bokhara for an extended period. The insurgency also began spreading to Kazakhstan, as well as the Tajik and Turkmen lands.

===Enver Pasha and the height of the Basmachi movement===
 
In November 1921, Enver Pasha, former Turkish war minister and one of the key architects of the Armenian genocide, arrived in Bukhara to assist the Soviet war effort. Enver Pasha had been an advocate of a Turkish-Soviet alliance against the British, and gained the trust of the Soviet authorities. Soon, however, he defected and became the single most important Basmachi leader, centralizing and revitalizing the movement. Enver Pasha intended to create a pan-Turkic confederation encompassing all of Central Asia, as well as Anatolia and Chinese lands. His call for jihad attracted much support, and he managed to transform the Basmachi guerillas into an army of 16,000 men. By early 1922, a considerable part of the Bukharan People&#x27;s Soviet Republic, including Samarkand and Dushanbe, was under Basmachi control. Meanwhile, Dungan Muslim Magaza Masanchi formed the Dungan Cavalry Regiment to fight for the Soviets against the Basmachi.

===Defeat of the movement===
Now fearing the total loss of Turkestan, the Soviet authorities once again adopted a double strategy to crush the rebellion: political reconciliation and cultural concessions along with overwhelming military power. Religious concessions reinstated Sharia law, while Koran schools and waqf lands were restored. Moscow sought to indigenize the fight with the creation of a volunteer militia composed of Muslim peasants, called the Red Sticks, and it is estimated that 15-25 percent of Soviet troops in this region were Muslim. The Soviets primarily relied on thousands of regular Red Army troops, veterans of the Civil War, now bolstered by air support. The strategy of concessions with airstrikes was successful, and when in May 1922 Enver Pasha rejected a peace offer and issued an ultimatum demanding that all Red Army troops be withdrawn from Turkestan within fifteen days, Moscow was well prepared for a confrontation. In June 1922 Soviet units led by General Kakurin (ru) defeated the Basmachi forces in the Battle of Kafrun. The Red Army began to drive the rebels eastwards, retaking considerable territory. Enver himself was killed in a failed last-ditch cavalry charge on August 4, 1922, near Baldzhuan (in present-day Tajikistan). His successor, Selim Pasha, continued the struggle but finally fled to Afghanistan in 1923.

In July to August 1923, a large Soviet offensive succeeded at forcing the Basmachi out of Garm. A Basmachi presence remained in the Ferghana Valley until 1924, and fighters there were led by Korşirmat (or Kurshirmat), who had renewed the revolt in 1920. British intelligence reported that Kurshirmat possessed forces of 5,000-6,000 men. After years of war, however, popular support for the Basmachi cause was drying up. Peasants wanted to return to work, especially now that Soviet policies had made Turkestan livable again. Kurshirmat&#x27;s forces shrank to around 2,000, many resorting to banditry, and he soon fled to Afghanistan. Turkestan was at this point exhausted by war. 200,000 people had fled Tajik lands, leaving two-thirds of arable land abandoned. Lesser devastation could be observed in Ferghana.

===Cross-border operations in northern Afghanistan===
====1929====

In January 1929, after coming to power in Afghanistan during the Afghan Civil War (1928–1929), Habibullāh Kalakāni allowed Basmachi insurgents to operate in northern Afghanistan, who then had established themselves in Imanseiide, Khan Abad, Rostaq, Taloqan, Fayzabad by the end of March 1929. In mid-March 1929, two raids were undertaken by the Afghan Basmachi into the Soviet Union, the first into Amu Darya, south-west of Kulyab, and the second was undertaken by Kurbashi Kerim Berdoi with 100 Basmachi troops. Both incursions were defeated. Further incursions were repelled on 17 March and 7 April. On 12 April, Basmachi insurgents successfully crossed the Panj River and captured the town of Togmai. Soon after, this force then reached Dzafr and Kevron. On 13 April, the Basmachi captured Qal&#x27;ai Khumb. and a few days later, occupied Gashion, and on the 15th, they captured Vanch, which the Soviets recaptured the next day.

Because of the Basmachi attacks, the Soviet Union dispatched a small force into Afghanistan from Termez on April 15, commanded by Vitaly Primakov, to support ousted Afghan King Amanullah Khan. This Red Army force of 700 to 1,000 eventually took control of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif and Tashqurghan. During the Soviet operation the Basmachi continued raiding across the border, capturing Kalai-Liabob on 20 April, and on 21 April capturing Nimichi, 35 kilometres east of Garm, after an intense battle. Between 20 and 22 April, further Basmachi units crossed into the Soviet Union, one of which made it as far as Tavildara before being turned back by the guards there on 30 April. On 22 April, the Basmachi captured Garm, which the Soviets recaptured either the same day or the next day. On 24 April, the Soviets began a large counteroffensive, and recaptured Kalai-Liabob that same day. On 3 May, the last Basmachi units retreated into Afghanistan.

The Red Army had planned to head for Kabul to take it back from the Saqqawists to Amanullah Khan. However the operation was halted after Moscow heard that Amanullah Khan had fled to the British Raj in exile on 23 May. In addition, international resentment (at a time the Soviet Union attempted to gain international recognition) was also cited as a reason for canceling the operation. The last Soviet unit crossed back from Afghanistan in June 1929.

====1930====

After the Saqqawists lost the civil war and Kalakani was executed, the Afghan prime minister Mohammad Hashim Khan on behalf of the new king, Mohammed Nader Shah, demanded Ibrahim Bek to lay down arms against the Soviet Union, but he refused. Afghanistan and Soviet Union agreed for another intervention, launched by the Red Army in June 1930 and commanded by Colonel Yakov Melkumov. The cavalry brigade advanced 50–70 km inland in northern Afghanistan and was carefully controlled as to not &quot;touch&quot; the farms and property of locals as to not affect their nationalistic or religious feelings. This was relatively successful, as the Afghan locals were friendly and guided them. Ibrahim Bek initially wanted to fight but after hearing of the cavalry&#x27;s strength and lack of local Afghan sympathy, he halted plans. As a result the Soviets did not face organized resistance and managed to eliminate the Basmachis and their accomplices. The yurts in the river valley including the villages of Aq Tepe and &#x27;Aliabad where Basmachis were based, and the Basmachi&#x27;s properties, were burned down, although the local Afghan population remained untouched. The Basmachis and accomplices lost 839 people, whereas the Soviet army had one loss (from drowning) and two injuries.

===Intermittent Basmachi operations after the Soviet victory===
After the Basmachi movement was destroyed as a political and military force, the fighters who remained hidden in mountainous areas conducted a guerrilla war. The Basmachi uprising had died out in most parts of Central Asia by 1926. However, skirmishes and occasional fighting along the border with Afghanistan continued until the early 1930s. Junaid Khan threatened Khiva in 1926, but was finally exiled in 1928. Two prominent commanders, Faizal Maksum and Ibrahim Bey, continued to operate out of Afghanistan and conducted a number of raids into the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in 1929. Ibrahim Bek led a brief resurgence of the movement when collectivization fuelled resistance and succeeded in delaying the policy until 1931 in Turkmenistan, but he was soon caught and executed. The movement then largely died out. The last major Basmachi combat operation occurred In October 1933, when Junaid Khan&#x27;s forces were defeated in the Karakum desert. The Basmachi movement had ended by 1934.

==Aftermath==
Indigenous leaders began to cooperate with Soviet authorities and large numbers of Central Asians joined the Soviet Communist Party under Lenin and Stalin&#x27;s indigenization policy. Many gained high positions in the governments of the Uzbek, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Kazakh and Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republics, formed out of the Turkestani Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924. During the Sovietization of Central Asia, Islam became the focus of antireligious campaigns. The government closed most mosques, repressing Islamic clerics and targeting symbols of Islamic identity such as the veil. Uzbeks who remained practicing Muslims were deemed nationalist and often targeted for imprisonment or execution. Stalinist collectivization and industrialization proceeded as elsewhere in the Soviet Union.

==Character of the movement==

The Basmachi movement has been characterized as a national liberation movement that sought to end foreign rule over the Central Asian territories then known as Turkestan, and also the protectorates of Khiva and Bokhara. It is suggested that &quot;basmacı&quot; is a Turkic word which refers to a bandit or marauder, such as the bands of thieves that preyed on caravans in the region, derived from the word &quot;&quot; – to raid, to press. The term &#x27;basmachi&#x27; was pejorative and used by the Soviets; the people it referred to did not use it to refer to themselves.

The Soviets portrayed the movement as being composed of brigands motivated by Islamic fundamentalism, waging a counterrevolutionary war with the support of British agents. In reality, the Basmachi were a diverse and multi-faceted group that received negligible foreign aid. The Basmachi were not viewed favorably by Western Powers, who saw the Basmachi as potential enemies due to the Pan-Turkist and Pan-Islamist ideologies that some of their leaders ascribed to. However, some Basmachi groups received support from British and Turkish intelligence services and in order to cut off this outside help, special military detachments of the Red Army masqueraded as Basmachi forces and successfully intercepted supplies.

Although many fighters were motivated by calls for jihad, the Basmachi drew support from many ideological camps and major sectors of the population. At some point or another the Basmachi attracted the support of Jadid reformers, pan-Turkic ideologues and leftist Turkestani nationalists. Peasants and nomads, long opposed to Russian colonial rule, reacted with hostility to anti-Islamic policies and Soviet requisitioning of food and livestock. The fact that Bolshevism in Turkestan was dominated by Russian colonists in Tashkent made Tsarist and Soviet rule appear identical. The ranks of the Basmachi were filled with those left jobless by poor economic conditions, and those who felt that they were opposing an attack on their way of life. The first Basmachi fighters were bandits, as their name suggests, and they reverted to brigandage as the movement fizzled later on. Although the Basmachi were relatively united at certain points, the movement suffered from atomization overall. Rivalry between various leaders and more serious ethnic disputes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks or Turkmen posed major problems to the movement.

==In popular culture==
The rebellion is featured in several &quot;Osterns&quot;, such as &quot;White Sun of the Desert&quot;, &quot;The Seventh Bullet&quot;, and &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, and in the television series &quot;State Border&quot;.

<text>A virtual organization is a temporary or permanent collection of geographically dispersed individuals, groups, organizational units, or entire organizations that depend on electronic linking in order to complete the production process ( working definition). Virtual organizations do not represent a firm’s attribute but can be considered as a different organizational form and carries out the objectives of cyber diplomacy.

Unfortunately, it is quite hard to find a precise and fixed definition of fundamental notions such as virtual organization or virtual company. The term virtual organization ensued from the phrase &quot;virtual reality&quot;, whose purpose is to look like reality by using electronic sounds and images. The term virtual organization implies the novel and innovative relationships between organizations and individuals. Technology and globalization both support this particular type of organization.

Virtual can be defined as &quot;not physically existing as such but made by software to appear to do so&quot;, in other words &quot;unreal but looking real&quot;. This definition precisely outlines the leading principle of this unconventional organization, which holds the form of a real (conventional) corporation from the outside but does not actually exist physically and implicates an entirely digital process relying on independents web associates. Thus, virtual organizations are centred on technology and position physical presence in the background. Virtual organizations possess limited physical resources as value is added through (mobile) knowledge rather than (immovable) equipment.

Virtual organizations necessitate associations, federations, relations, agreements and alliance relationships as they essentially are partnership webs of disseminated organizational entities or self-governing corporations.

== Apparition and evolution ==

===1980s ===

The emergence of outsourcing in the 80s unquestionably played a significant role as its aim is to eradicate unproductive internal services and transfers the difficulty outside of the organization. Outsourcing necessarily implies partnerships as companies resort to other establishments. Thus, this method highlighted the necessity of alliances and networking in a business and provoked a great interest for new disciplines. Indeed, this process has dramatically changed the way organizations consider partners and has raised their awareness concerning the benefits smart alliances can offer. Though, until the early 1980s, this extremely bureaucratic organization arrangement (involving challenging, complex and slower decision-making) was considered adequate to manage a vast number of employees.

===1990s ===

The terms virtual organization, virtual enterprise or virtual corporation were first utilized in the early 1990s as demonstrate the work of Jan Hopland, Roger N. Nagel, William H. Davidow and Malone. The table below allows us to understand more specifically their faintly distinctive theories:

===Today ===

As mentioned before, there is not yet a universal definition of the term virtual organization. Even though this concept started to evolve a long time ago it is still progressing nowadays. We can observe below the innovative virtual organization&#x27;s model focusing on quickly and efficiently creating first-class products (using each partner core competence).

== Technology required ==

Virtual organizations are supported by primary technologies such as the Internet and the World Wide Web, EDI, telecommunications, e-mails, groupware, and video conferencing.

=== Knowledge management technologies ===
Knowledge management technologies assisting virtual organizations comprise:

* Collaborative technologies
* Extensible markup language (XML)
* Intranets and extranets
* Personal devices
* Wireless technologies
* Virtual reality (VR)
* Portals

=== EDI ===

EDI can constitute a useful tool for virtual organizations as it transfers information (in the adequate form which a computer can utilize straightforwardly) from a computer to another and does not necessitate the intervention of any individual. EDI could be a benefit to virtual organizations in numerous ways as the exchange of information between associates is facilitated and more efficient than with non-electronic transfer: better inventory management and shipping performance, amount of time saved and faults escaped by the fact that data requisite to be entered only once, as well as a rise of the speed and accuracy of processes. However, using EDI is not the optimal choice to make for assisting communication within a virtual organization, as the flexibility required for quick reactions is lacking in this system.

=== Groupware ===

Virtual organizations can be supported by groupware systems as it delivers a shared core of information to partners and a platform to collaborate regardless of the associates’ physical position. This way, groupware systems can assist associates track the rate of progress in work being done in a way that they can cooperate on the project without being concerned about geographical barriers. However, in a similar way as EDI, groupware is not the ideal decision to make for assisting communication within a virtual organization as it would not empower the organization to rapidly form an alliance to respond to a market opportunity, even though it offers more flexibility than EDI.

=== World Wide Web (WWW) ===

Many virtual firms have chosen the internet-based WWW in order to support organizational communication, as it constitutes a practical alternative to the EDI and groupware’s inflexibility. Even though helping virtual organizations’ associates to communicate was not the initial purpose of the WWW, it is still favourably relevant to this category of organizations. The web permits all co-workers (even the isolated ones) to share their thoughts, opinions and every part of any mutual mission as it was shaped to be a sort of data gathering of individuals’ knowledge.

== Benefits ==

=== To the organization ===

* Competitive advantage
* As a way of to conduct supply chain integration or bridge the merger and acquisition processes between two companies.[online] 
* A pool of abilities and knowledge
* Flexibility, dynamism and better responsiveness : virtual organizations, also called &quot;boundaryless organization&quot;, do not imply time or geographical obstacles
* Less investments costs initially
* Productivity: the implementation of virtual organization implies a 30 to 50% rise of productivity
* Less costs, more profits: virtual organization are saving a huge amount of money as they are no real-estate investments necessary, the labor cost is inferior and the number of errors is poorer 

=== To the employees ===

* More independence: individuals can work when they need to and decide in which ways 
* Amount of stress reduced: no workplace pressure and consequently an improved personal and family life
* Less money spent: diminution of gas consumption or money spent on public transports

=== To the society ===

* An environmental benefit: less pollution
* Expansion of the workplace area: possibility to work efficiently in the rural areas

== Issues and challenges encountered ==

Despite the advantages provided, it can be quite challenging to those familiar to conventional work group to lead as a virtual organization. Thus, large risks are conveyed with the challenge of working virtually as this new organizational structure implies several issues. Some people wrongly think that the challenges only come from the technology management but we should not forget the importance of humans. 
Clearly information technology offers an efficient and largely beneficial platform but we should not neglect the necessity, especially in a virtual organization, of the individuals’ skills and manner to collaborate.

=== Communication ===

Communication is a crucial factor in a virtual organization as it is responsible of its efficiency and even to its survival. Virtual organizations imply various autonomous and international workers, which also involve challenges such as different time zones and language barriers. The collaboration between associates might also get quite complicated as this type of organization denotes only a slight amount of face-to-face interaction. Thus, a lack of multiple communication approaches can be observed in virtual organizations.

=== Cultural ===

Culture constitutes an essential element in any organization of any type. Yet, virtual organizations have to be even more vigilant about this notion as they imply a shared leadership between the team, which is composed of self-reliant workers from all around the world. Virtual organizations must find a way to overcome cultural differences, which involve dissimilar approaches of working (such as time and deadlines) and living (punctuality for instance), in other words, distinctive philosophies. Thus, virtual organization must exegete respect for differences among the team.

=== Interpersonal ===

Managing virtually successfully requires a valuable communication and cooperation among the team. Perceptions between partners might be quite dissimilar and could lead to conflicts concerning the management of the virtual organization. Thus, it is more than necessary that associates build a solid relationship despite the distance obstacle Trust is also a crucial matter as a shared leadership among co-workers consequently implies the loss of control on certain functions entrusted to other associates.

=== Technological ===

Virtual organizations are completely dependent to technology as they are entirely internet-based. It is more than necessary for the individuals involved in a partnership to possess similar technological tools from its associates. Compatibility matters resulting from the hardware and software such as the operating system as well as certain computer’s software might disturb the efficiency of the virtual organization. For instance, the occurrence of incompatibility issues (difficulty in integrating information generated with dissimilar tools) concerning the hardware or software, would dramatically affect virtual organizations’ process and performance as they depend on these tools. Institute, uphold and spread a definite common knowledge between partners is one of the ultimate issue to virtual organizations’ management. Security and data protection also constitute a significant challenge as all the information regarding virtual organizations are transmitted and gathered digitally. A continuous control and evaluation of the technology utilized should be done by virtual organizations in order to prevent being outdated and losing opportunities.

=== Economical ===

Virtual organization involves considerable costs. Between the setup and equipment costs and the maintenance costs, the bill can become quite steep quickly. It also constitutes a challenge to measure, evaluate and track the work done within the different departments of the virtual infrastructure. This might lead to partners missing deadlines, the necessity to rework and, thus, a loss of efficiency and profit.

== Examples of virtual organizations ==

=== Private sector ===

* Hollywood 
* British Telecom
* Reuters Holdings
* Aventis
* Center for Culture &amp; Global Studies

=== Public sector ===

* United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Plant Data Center
* United States Department of Energy (The Office of Science Integrated Support Center) 
* Emics and OphSmart

<doc id="627598" wikidata="Q7099769" url="?curid=627598" title="Orange drink">
<text>The term orange drink refers to a sweet, sugary, sometimes carbonated, orange-flavored drink.

Typically such beverages contain little or no orange juice and are mainly composed of water, sugar or sweeteners, flavor, coloring, and additives. Although many orange drinks are fortified with Vitamin C, they are typically very low in nutritional value. 

In the United States, as orange drinks can be confused with orange juice, the Food and Drug Administration requires orange drinks, as well as other beverages whose names allude to fruit products, to state the percentage of juice contained above the &quot;Nutrition Facts&quot; label. and requires companies to state them as orange drinks instead of orange juice.

==Varieties==
* Fanta, a global brand originally centred on carbonated orange drink.
* Orange squash
* Orangeade can refer either to a non-carbonated orange drink, or a carbonated orange soft drink. Non-alcoholic orangeade can be made from orange juice, simple syrup, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and club soda or water. An alcoholic version can be made using, e.g., gin, lemon juice, orange juice, and club soda, or, alternatively, tequila, orange juice, simple syrup, and seltzer; or by taking non-alcoholic orangeade and adding vodka.
* Orangina, carbonated orange drink popular in France, made with 10% concentrated orange, a 2% combination of concentrated lemon, concentrated mandarin and concentrated grapefruit juices as well as 2% orange pulp.
* McDonald&#x27;s Orange Drink, also often termed &quot;orangeade&quot; on menus until the 1970s, which is Hi-C Orange Lavaburst. It was discontinued in April 2017 and brought back when customers complained.
* Nutri Star (the Venezuelan version of &quot;fortified orange drink.&quot;)
* Sunny Delight
* Tang
* Kwenchy Kups, a sugar-free orange flavour drink sold in plastic pots.
* A product named Orange Drink, marketed by the Dairy Maid company on the Bahamian island of New Providence.
* In 2002, a &quot;cheap, fortified, orange-flavored drink&quot; was developed with the intention of improving nutrition in the third world by adding vitamin A, iron, and iodine to people&#x27;s diets.

<text>The Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF), also known as OpenDocument, standardized as ISO 26300, is an open file format for word processing documents, spreadsheets, presentations and graphics and using ZIP-compressed XML files. It was developed with the aim of providing an open, XML-based file format specification for office applications.

The standard is developed and maintained by a technical committee in the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) consortium. It was based on the Sun Microsystems specification for OpenOffice.org XML, the default format for OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice. It was originally developed for StarOffice &quot;to provide an open standard for office documents.&quot;

In addition to being an OASIS standard, it is published as an ISO/IEC international standard ISO/IEC 26300 Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument).
From March 2024, the current version is 1.4.

==Specifications==
The most common filename extensions used for OpenDocument documents are:
* codice_1 and codice_2 for word processing (text) documents
* codice_3 and codice_4 for spreadsheets
* codice_5 and codice_6 for presentations
* codice_7 and codice_8 for graphics
* codice_9 for formula, mathematical equations

The original OpenDocument format consists of an XML document that has codice_10 as its root element. OpenDocument files can also take the format of a ZIP compressed archive containing a number of files and directories; these can contain binary content and benefit from ZIP&#x27;s lossless compression to reduce file size. OpenDocument benefits from separation of concerns by separating the content, styles, metadata, and application settings into four separate XML files.

There is a comprehensive set of example documents in OpenDocument format available. The whole test suite is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license.

==History==
===Conception===
The OpenDocument standard was developed by a Technical Committee (TC) under the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) industry consortium. The ODF-TC has members from a diverse set of companies and individuals. Active TC members have voting rights. Members associated with Sun and IBM have sometimes had a large voting influence. The standardization process involved the developers of many office suites or related document systems.

The first official ODF-TC meeting to discuss the standard was 16 December 2002. OASIS approved OpenDocument as an OASIS standard on 1 May 2005. OASIS submitted the ODF specification to ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) on 16 November 2005, under Publicly Available Specification (PAS) rules. ISO/IEC standardization for an open document standard including text, spreadsheet and presentation was proposed for the first time in DKUUG 28 August 2001.

After a six-month review period, on 3 May 2006, OpenDocument unanimously passed its six-month DIS (Draft International Standard) ballot in JTC 1 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34), with broad participation, after which the OpenDocument specification was &quot;approved for release as an ISO and IEC International Standard&quot; under the name ISO/IEC 26300:2006.

After responding to all written ballot comments, and a 30-day default ballot, the OpenDocument international standard went to publication in ISO, officially published 30 November 2006.

In 2006, Garry Edwards, a member of OASIS TC since 2002, along with Sam Hiser, and Paul &quot;Marbux&quot; E. Merrell founded the OpenDocument Foundation. The aim of this project was to be open-source representative of the format in OASIS. The immediate aim of this project was to develop software that would convert legacy Microsoft Office documents to ODF. By October 2007 the project was a failure: Conversion of Microsoft Office documents could not be achieved. By this time, The foundation was convinced that ODF was not moving in a direction that they supported. As a result, it announced the decision to abandon its namesake format in favor of W3C&#x27;s Compound Document Format (CDF), which was in early stages of its development. The foundation, however, never acted on this decision and was soon dissolved. The CDF was never designed for this purpose either.

===Further standardization===

Further standardization work with OpenDocument includes:
* The OASIS Committee Specification OpenDocument 1.0 (second edition) corresponds to the published ISO/IEC 26300:2006 standard. The content of ISO/IEC 26300 and OASIS OpenDocument v1.0 2nd ed. is identical. It includes the editorial changes made to address JTC1 ballot comments. It is available in ODF, HTML and PDF formats.
* OpenDocument 1.1 includes additional features to address accessibility concerns. It was approved as an OASIS Standard on 2007-02-01 following a call for vote issued on 2007-01-16. The public announcement was made on 2007-02-13. This version was not initially submitted to ISO/IEC, because it is considered to be a minor update to ODF 1.0 only, and OASIS were working already on ODF 1.2 at the time ODF 1.1 was approved. However it was later submitted to ISO/IEC and published in March 2012 as &quot;ISO/IEC 26300:2006/Amd 1:2012 – Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.1&quot;.
* OpenDocument 1.2 includes additional accessibility features, RDF-based metadata, a spreadsheet formula specification based on OpenFormula, support for digital signatures and some features suggested by the public. It consists of three parts: Part 1: OpenDocument Schema, Part 2: Recalculated Formula (OpenFormula) Format and Part 3: Packages. Version 1.2 of the specification was approved as an OASIS Standard on 29 September 2011. It was submitted to the relevant ISO committee under the Publicly Available Specification (PAS) procedure in March 2014. In October 2014, it was unanimously approved as a Draft International Standard. Some comments were raised in the process that needed to be addressed before OpenDocument 1.2 could proceed to become an International Standard. OpenDocument 1.2 was published as ISO/IEC standard on 17 June 2015.
* OpenDocument 1.3 includes additional features for digital signatures, encryption, change-tracking and inter-operability. Version 1.3 of the OpenDocument specification was approved as an OASIS Standard April 2021. The specification was completed as the result of the COSM crowdfunding project seeded by The Document Foundation.

==Application support==

===Software===
The OpenDocument format is used in free software and in proprietary software. This includes office suites (both stand-alone and web-based) and individual applications such as word-processors, spreadsheets, presentation, and data management applications. Prominent text editors, word processors and office suites supporting OpenDocument fully or partially include:

* AbiWord
* Adobe Buzzword
* Apache OpenOffice supports ODF 1.2
* Bean (software)
* Calibre ebook viewer, converter, editor, and manager
* Calligra Suite
* Collabora Office and Collabora Online
*Corel WordPerfect Office X6
* Dropbox
* Evince
* Gnumeric
* Google Docs
* IBM Lotus Symphony
* Inkscape exports codice_7
* KOffice
* LibreOffice
* Microsoft Office 2003 and Office XP (with the Open Source OpenXML/ODF Translator Add-in for Office)
* Microsoft Office 2007 (with Service Pack 2 or 3) supports ODF 1.1 (Windows only)
* Microsoft Office 2010 supports ODF 1.1 (Windows only)
* Microsoft Office 2013 supports ODF 1.2 (Windows only)
* Microsoft Office 2016 and 2019 support ODF 1.2 (Windows: read/write; OS X: read-only after online conversion)
* Microsoft Office 2021 supports ODF 1.3 (Windows and MacOS)
* Microsoft OneDrive / Office Web Apps
* NeoOffice
* Okular
* ONLYOFFICE
* OpenOffice.org
* Quarto and R Markdown can export to codice_1
* Scribus imports codice_1 and codice_7
* SoftMaker Office
* Sun Microsystems StarOffice
* TextEdit
* WordPad (Windows 7 and later, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later) supports ODF 1.1
* Zoho Office Suite
Various organizations have announced development of conversion software (including &quot;plugins&quot; and &quot;filters&quot;) to support OpenDocument on Microsoft&#x27;s products. , there are nine packages of conversion software. Microsoft first released support for the OpenDocument Format in Office 2007 SP2. However, the implementation faced substantial criticism and the ODF Alliance and others claimed that the third party plugins provided better support. Microsoft Office 2010 can open and save OpenDocument Format documents natively, although not all features are supported. In July 2024, Microsoft announced support for ODF 1.4 (prior to it being released) in Microsoft 365 apps, starting with version 2404 on Windows and 16.84 on macOS.

Starting with Mac OS X 10.5, the TextEdit application and Quick Look preview feature support the OpenDocument Text format.

===Accessibility===
==Licensing==

===Public access to the standard===
Versions of the OpenDocument Format approved by OASIS are available for free download and use. The ITTF has added ISO/IEC 26300 to its &quot;list of freely available standards&quot;; anyone may download and use this standard free-of-charge under the terms of a click-through license.

===Additional royalty-free licensing===
Obligated members of the OASIS ODF TC have agreed to make deliverables available to implementors under the OASIS Royalty Free with Limited Terms policy.

Key contributor Sun Microsystems made an irrevocable intellectual property covenant, providing all implementers with the guarantee that Sun will not seek to enforce any of its enforceable U.S. or foreign patents against any implementation of the OpenDocument specification in which development Sun participates to the point of incurring an obligation.

A second contributor to ODF development, IBM – which, for instance, has contributed Lotus spreadsheet documentation – has made their patent rights available through their&quot; Interoperability Specifications Pledge&quot; in which &quot;IBM irrevocably covenants to you that it will not assert any Necessary Claims against you for your making, using, importing, selling, or offering for sale Covered Implementations.&quot;

The Software Freedom Law Center has examined whether there are any legal barriers to the use of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) in free and open source software arising from the standardization process. In their opinion ODF is free of legal encumbrances that would prevent its use in free and open source software, as distributed under licenses authored by Apache and the FSF.

==Response==

===Support for OpenDocument===
Several governments, companies, organizations and software products support the OpenDocument format. For example:
* The OpenDoc Society runs frequent ODF Plugfests in association with industry groups and Public Sector organisations. The 10th Plugfest was hosted by the UK Government Digital Service in conjunction with industry associations including the OpenForum Europe and OpenUK (formerly Open Source Consortium).
** An output of the 10th Plugfest was an ODF toolkit which includes &quot;Open Document Format principles for Government Technology&quot; that has the purpose of simply explaining the case for ODF directed at the &quot;average civil servant&quot; and includes an extract from the UK Government policy relating to Open Document Format. 
** The toolkit also includes a single page graphical image designed to articulate the consequences of not choosing Open Document Format. The illustration has now been translated into more than 10 languages.
* Information technology companies like Apple Inc., Adobe Systems, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Nokia, Novell, Red Hat, Oracle as well as other companies who may or may not be working inside the OASIS OpenDocument Adoption Technical Committee.
* Over 600 companies and organizations promote OpenDocument format through The OpenDocument Format Alliance.
* NATO with its 26 members uses ODF as a mandatory standard for all members.
* The TAC (Telematics between Administrations Committee), composed of e-government policy-makers from the 25 European Union Member States, endorsed a set of recommendations for promoting the use of open document formats in the public sector.
* The free office suites Apache OpenOffice, Calligra, KOffice, NeoOffice and LibreOffice all use OpenDocument as their default file format.
* Several organisations, such as the OpenDocument Fellowship and OpenDoc Society were founded to support and promote OpenDocument.
* The UK government has adopted ODF as the standard for all documents in the UK civil service
* The Russian government has recommended adopting ODF as the standard in the public sector as by GOST R ISO/MEK 26300-2010
* The Wikimedia Foundation supports ODF export from MediaWiki, which powers Wikipedia and a number of other Internet wiki-based sites.
* The default text processing applications in Windows 10 (WordPad) and Mac OS 10.9 (TextEdit) support OpenDocument Text.

On 4 November 2005, IBM and Sun Microsystems convened the &quot;OpenDocument (ODF) Summit&quot; in Armonk, New York, to discuss how to boost OpenDocument adoption. The ODF Summit brought together representatives from several industry groups and technology companies, including Oracle, Google, Adobe, Novell, Red Hat, Computer Associates, Corel, Nokia, Intel, and Linux e-mail company Scalix (LaMonica, 10 November 2005). The providers committed resources to technically improve OpenDocument through existing standards bodies and to promote its usage in the marketplace, possibly through a stand-alone foundation. Scholars have suggested that the &quot;OpenDocument standard is the wedge that can hold open the door for competition, particularly with regard to the specific concerns of the public sector.&quot; Indeed, adoption by the public sector has risen considerably since the promulgation of the OpenDocument format initiated the 2005/2006 time period.

* Different applications using ODF as a standard document format have different methods of providing macro/scripting capabilities. There is no macro language specified in ODF. Users and developers differ on whether inclusion of a standard scripting language would be desirable.
* The ODF specification for tracked changes is limited and does not fully specify all cases, resulting in implementation-specific behaviors. In addition, OpenDocument does not support change tracking in elements like tables or MathML.
* It is not permitted to use generic ODF formatting style elements (like font information) for the MathML elements.

==Adoption==
One objective of open formats like OpenDocument is to guarantee long-term access to data without legal or technical barriers, and some governments have come to view open formats as a public policy issue. Several governments around the world have introduced policies of partial or complete adoption. What this means varies from case to case; in some cases, it means that the ODF standard has a national standard identifier; in some cases, it means that the ODF standard is permitted to be used where national regulation says that non-proprietary formats must be used, and in still other cases, it means that some government body has actually decided that ODF will be used in some specific context. The following is an incomplete list:

* International
** NATO
** European Union
* Argentina
* Belgium
* Brazil
* Croatia
* Finland
* Denmark
* France
* Germany

<doc id="627615" wikidata="Q352664" url="?curid=627615" title="Adat">
<text>Adat (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ) is a generic term derived from Arabic to describe a variety of local customary practices and traditions deemed compatible with Islam as observed by Muslim communities in the Balkans, North Caucasus, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. Despite its Arabic origin, the term adat resonates deeply throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, where due to colonial influence, its usage has been systematically institutionalised into various non-Muslim communities. Within the region, the term refers, in a broader sense, to the customary norms, rules, interdictions, and injunctions that guide individuals&#x27; conduct as members of the community and the sanctions and forms of address by which these norms and rules are upheld. Adat also includes the set of local and traditional laws and dispute resolution systems by which these societies are regulated.

==Origin==
The word &quot;adat&quot; is derived from the Arabic &quot;ʿādā́t&quot; (عادات), the plural form of &quot;ʿā́da&quot; (عادَة), meaning custom, or habit, and is considered synonymous with &quot;urf&quot; (عرف), something which is commonly known or accepted. It generally refers to the result of long-standing convention, either deliberately adopted or the result of unconscious adaptation to circumstances, that has been followed where practical considerations have been uppermost.

Prior to the arrival of Islam, the peoples of the North Caucasus and Central Asia had long-established codes of legal and civil law, which in the Islamic period came to be known by the term &quot;adat&quot;. Adat in traditional Central Asian societies are guided by authoritative members of communities, usually councils of Aqsaqals. It is based on a tribal code of conduct and on centuries of experience in conflict resolution between individuals, communities, and tribes. In the North Caucasus, the traditional value codex of adat held that the Teip (&#x27;clan&#x27;) was the chief reference for loyalty, honor, shame, and collective responsibility. The Russian Empire&#x27;s colonial administration did not interfere with local legal practices and delegated the administration at the local community level to the councils of aqsaqals and teips, as did the Bolsheviks during the first years of the revolution of 1917. The adat was practiced among the Central Asians and North Caucasians up until the early 1930s, before Soviet authorities banned its use and replaced it with civil law.

In Southeast Asia, the concept of adat and its meanings were first formulated in the Islamised Malay-speaking world, apparently to distinguish non-Islamic from Islamic practices. In the fifteenth century, the Melaka empire developed a code of international shipping law, &quot;Undang-Undang Laut Melaka&quot;, and a civil and commercial code, &quot;Undang-Undang Melaka&quot;, which was heavily Islamic but with extensive adat influences. These codes would later spread across the region and become the legal source for local jurisprudence in major regional sultanates like Brunei, Johor, Pattani, and Aceh.

In the early decades of the twentieth century, in the Dutch East Indies, the study of adat emerged as a specialised field of inquiry. Although associated with the needs of colonial administration, this study nevertheless gave rise to an active scholarly discipline that dealt with differing systems of adat comparatively. Among notable scholars in this study were Cornelis van Vollenhoven, Ter Haar, and Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje. Several key concepts that are still being used today within the customary law research in modern Indonesia are: &quot;adatrecht&quot; (&#x27;adat law&#x27;), &quot;adatrechtskringen&quot; (&#x27;adat law circles&#x27;), &quot;beschikkingsrecht&quot; (communal rights over land or &#x27;right to avail&#x27;), and &quot;adatrechtsgemeenschappen&quot; (&#x27;adat law communities&#x27;). The adat law or adatrecht has been used by colonial governments as a legal term designating a prescriptive right, which was given currency as an independent legal entity apart from the canon law. Local indigenous laws and customs of all ethnic groups, including those of non-Muslims, began to be collectively termed as &quot;adat&quot; and were encoded into units of jural management, whereby legal pluralism in the East Indies was introduced. Under this scheme, based on a classification of adat systems as cultural geographic units, the Dutch divided the East Indies into at least nineteen adat law areas.

==Modern usage==
Adat is still enforced in the courts of Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia as personal law in certain aspects. In Malaysia, each state&#x27;s constitution has empowered Malay rulers as the head of Islam and Malay customs in their respective state. State councils known as &quot;Majlis Agama Islam dan Adat Istiadat Melayu&quot; (Council of Islam and Malay Customs) are responsible in advising the rulers as well as regulating both Islamic affairs and adat. Legal proceedings on matters related to Islamic affairs and adat (such as &quot;harta sepencarian&quot; or &#x27;matrimonial property&#x27; cases) are carried out in Syariah Court. In Sarawak and Sabah, native adat laws of non-Malay indigenous communities were institutionalised through the establishment of courts known as &quot;Mahkamah Bumiputera&quot; (&#x27;Bumiputra courts&#x27;) and &quot;Mahkamah Anak Negeri&quot; (&#x27;native courts&#x27;), respectively. A parallel system exists in Peninsular Malaysia for ethnic Malays, called &quot;Mahkamah Penghulu&quot; (Penghulu&#x27;s courts—Mukim headman courts) but with very limited jurisdiction. In Indonesia, adat rules are still of legal relevance in some areas, especially in most Hindu villages in Bali, the Tenger area, and in the regions of Yogyakarta and Surakarta.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, adat practices in Central Asia began to be resurrected in the 1990s among rural communities. This was largely due to a decay of legal and law-enforcement institutions in many parts of the region. Legal constitutions also contributed to this process, since they empowered some traditional institutions, such as councils of elders (aqsaqals), with some administrative authorities. In the North Caucasus, traditional, clan-based systems of self-government, which had been functioning underground since the 1950s, began to reappear in response to the federal government&#x27;s neglect and local administrative impotence. Due to the loss of Islamic scholars and literature during the Stalinist years, the adat that emerged contained almost no elements of Islamic law. However, there is growing participation by Muslim scholars in adat proceedings, some of whom are now involved in important decisions in village assemblies and district administrations.

==Malay culture==
In the Malay states of Southeast Asia, the Malay community may be classified formally and historically into two different groups: one following &quot;Adat temenggung&quot; and the other, &quot;Adat perpatih&quot;.

&quot;Adat temenggung&quot; (customs or rules of Temenggung) is the most common form of adat, which is patrilineal and more pervasive, and it can be found in the majority of Malay states. &quot;Adat perpatih&quot;, confined almost exclusively to Negeri Sembilan, where dwell the descendants of the Minangkabau immigrants from West Sumatra, is associated with a matrilineal rule of descent and a political structure based upon the kinship system.

Though both adat originated from tribal organizations in the past, it is in &quot;Adat perpatih&quot; that the remnants of tribal structure are clearly evident at present. To cite one instance, marriage between two persons belonging to the same clan is regarded as incestuous and is strictly prohibited.

The major concern with adat, both &quot;temenggung&quot; and &quot;perpatih&quot;, in the research and literature, has been with so-called undang-undang adat law, or customary law, or the definition of rights to property, rank, and other privileges in traditional Malay society. Studies of adat law have chiefly been preoccupied with the questions of its relationship to Islamic (Sharia) law and the legal cases to which such conflicts have given rise. In Malay culture, there are at least five different perspectives of adat:
* Adatullah (عادت الله) – the absolute form of adat that refers to natural order created by Allah: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. &quot;Adatullah&quot; may also refer to any practice that is almost absolutely based on ahkam and the rules of Islam, like the concept of musyawarah (discussion) and muafakat (consensus) applied in the Malay kingship system.
* Adat muhakamah (عادت محكمة) – the term refers to traditional laws, commandments, and orders compiled into legal codes by rulers to maintain social order and harmony. The adat laws, often blended together with Islamic laws, were the main written legal reference for Malay societies since the classical era and commonly referred to as &quot;kanun&quot;. The earliest example of &quot;adat muhakamah&quot; is the Terengganu Inscription Stone (1303), which contains a proclamation issued by the &quot;Sri Paduka Tuan&quot; of Terengganu, urging his subjects to extend and uphold Islam and providing ten basic laws for their guidance. Other notable Malay legal codes are &quot;Hukum Kanun Melaka&quot; (&quot;Laws of Melaka&quot;), &quot;Hukum Kanun Pahang&quot; (&quot;Laws of Pahang&quot;), &quot;Undang-Undang Sembilan Puluh Sembilan&quot; (&quot;99 Laws&quot;) of Perak, &quot;Hukum Kanun Brunei&quot; (Laws of Brunei), and many others.
* Adatunnah (عادتنه) – also commonly known as &quot;resam&quot; (norms), &quot;adatunnah&quot; is a form of adat derived from social norms that are perceived as having good moral values and do not go against either &quot;adatullah&quot; or &quot;adat muhakamah&quot;. Examples include gotong royong, organizing of rumah terbuka (a form of social event traditionally held at home during festive seasons, where well-wishers are received and which everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend), and learning of the Malay martial art Silat.
* Adat istiadat (عادت إستعادت) – defined as rituals mainly performed during festive celebrations and formal ceremonies, such as the installation of Malay rulers. The purpose of these rituals is to prescribe proper etiquette, with the means of glorifying the celebrations and ceremonies.
* Adat nenek moyang – refers to &quot;adat istiadat&quot; (rituals), practices derived from pre-Islamic elements that some scholars think are against the teachings of Islam. Although Islam has been deeply rooted in the life of Malay society for hundreds of years, many practices of &quot;adat nenek moyang&quot; have prevailed. Continuous efforts have been made by the ulama and community leaders to promote the discontinuation of such practices as &quot;perayaan mandi safar&quot; (safar bath festival) and &quot;tepung tawar&quot; (plain flour ritual) when one enters a new house in Malaysia. However, among the Malays of Indonesia, the ulama supports such practices and believe that they do not go against the teachings of Islam.

<text>Paul Henry Hopkins (September 25, 1904 – January 2, 2004) was an American right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Washington Senators (1927, 1929) and St. Louis Browns (1929).

Hopkins was born in Chester, Connecticut. His major league debut came on the same day that Babe Ruth hit his record-tying 59th home run on September 29, 1927. Hopkins said he did not know that he would be facing Ruth when he entered the game in the fifth inning with the bases loaded. He finished his career with a record of 1–1, 11 strikeouts, and a 2.96 earned run average in 11 games; he left St. Louis following the 1929 season after injuring a tendon.

Hopkins died in Deep River, Connecticut, at 99 years of age, having worked for the University of Illinois&#x27; RSC division for years. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former major league player.

==Quotation==
&quot;Then he (Babe Ruth) strolled out from the Yankee bench and walked up to the plate. I was not excited or awed.&quot; – Paul Hopkins in &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot; (1998).

<doc id="627628" wikidata="Q1924293" url="?curid=627628" title="Database marketing">
<text>Database marketing is a form of direct marketing that uses databases of customers or potential customers to generate personalized communications in order to promote a product or service for marketing purposes. The method of communication can be any addressable medium, as in direct marketing.

The distinction between direct and database marketing stems primarily from the attention paid to the analysis of data. Database marketing emphasizes the use of statistical techniques to develop models of customer behavior, which are then used to select customers for communications. As a consequence, database marketers also tend to be heavy users of data warehouses, because having a greater amount of data about customers increases the likelihood that a more accurate model can be built.

There are two main types of marketing databases, consumer databases, and business databases. Consumer databases are primarily geared towards companies that sell to consumers, often abbreviated as [business-to-consumer] (B2C) or BtoC. Business marketing databases are often much more advanced in the information that they can provide. This is mainly because business databases aren&#x27;t restricted by the same privacy laws as consumer databases.

The &quot;database&quot; is usually name, address, and transaction history details from internal sales or delivery systems, or a bought-in compiled &quot;list&quot; from another organization, which has captured that information from its customers. Typical sources of compiled lists are charity donation forms, application forms for any free product or contest, product warranty cards, subscription forms, and credit application forms.

== Background ==
Database marketing emerged in the 1980s as a new, improved form of direct marketing. During this period traditional &quot;list broking&quot; was under pressure to modernize, because it was offline and tape-based, and because lists tended to hold limited data. At the same time, with new technologies enabling customer responses to be recorded, direct response marketing was in ascendancy, with the aim of opening up a two-way communication, or dialogue, with customers.

Robert D. &quot;Bob&quot; and Kate Kestnbaum developed new metrics for direct marketing such as customer lifetime value, and applied financial modelling and econometrics to marketing strategies. In 1967, they founded the consulting firm Kestnbaum &amp; Co, that employed several notable database marketeers such as Robert Blattberg, Rick Courtheaux and Robert Shaw.

Kestnbaum collaborated with Shaw in the 1980s on several online marketing database developments - for BT (20 million customers), BA (10 million) and Barclays (13 million). Shaw incorporated new features into the Kestnbaum approach, including telephone and field sales channel automation, contact strategy optimization, campaign management and co-ordination, marketing resource management, marketing accountability and marketing analytics. The designs of these systems have been widely copied subsequently and incorporated into CRM and MRM packages in the 1990s and later.

The earliest recorded definition of Database Marketing was in 1988 in the book of the same name (Shaw and Stone 1988 Database Marketing):

:&quot;Database Marketing is an interactive approach to marketing, which uses individually addressable marketing media and channels (such as E mail, telephone and the sales force): to extend help to a company&#x27;s target audience; to stimulate their demand; and to stay close to them by recording and keeping an electronic database memory of the customer, prospect and all commercial contacts, to help improve all future contacts and to ensure more realistic of all marketing.&quot;

== Growth and evolution ==
The growth of database marketing is driven by a number of environmental issues. Fletcher, Wheeler and Wright (1991) classified these issues into four main categories: 
#Changing role of direct marketing
#* The move to relationship marketing for competitive advantage.
#* The decline in the effectiveness of traditional media.
#* The overcrowding and myopia of existing sales channels.
#Changing cost structures
#* The decline in electronic processing costs.
#* The increase in marketing costs.
#Changing technology
#* The advent of new methods of shopping and paying.
#* The development of economical methods for differentiating customer communication.
#Changing market conditions
#* The desire to measure the impact of marketing efforts.
#* The fragmentation of consumer and business markets.

Shaw and Stone (1988) noted that companies go through evolutionary phases in the developing their database marketing systems. They identify the four phases of database development as:
# mystery lists;
# buyer databases;
# coordinated customer communication; and
# integrated marketing.

== Sources of data ==
Although organizations of any size can employ database marketing, it is particularly well-suited to companies with large numbers of customers. This is because a large population provides greater opportunity to find segments of customers or prospects that can be communicated with in a customized manner. In smaller (and more homogeneous) databases, it will be difficult to justify on economic terms the investment required to differentiate messages. As a result, database marketing has flourished in sectors, such as financial services, telecommunications, and retail, all of which have the ability to generate significant amounts of transaction data for millions of clients.

Database marketing applications can be divided logically between those marketing programs that reach existing customers and those that are aimed at prospective customers.

=== Consumer data ===
In to existing customers, more sophisticated marketers often build broad databases of customer information. These may include a variety of data, including name and address, history of shopping and purchases, demographics, and the history of past communications to and from customers. For larger companies with millions of customers, such data warehouses can often be multiple terabytes in size.

Marketing to prospects general, database marketers seek to have as data available about customers and prospects as possible. For marketing relies extensively on third-party sources of data. In most developed countries, there are a number of providers of such data. Such data is usually restricted to name, address, and telephone, along with demographics, some supplied by consumers, and others inferred by the data compiler. Companies may also acquire prospect data directly through the use of sweepstakes, contests, on-line registrations, and other lead generation activities.

=== Business data ===
For many business-to-business (B2B) company marketers, the number of customers and prospects will be smaller than that of comparable business-to-consumer (B2C) companies. Also, their relationships with customers will often rely on intermediaries, such as salespeople, agents, and dealers, and the number of transactions per customer may be small. As a result, business-to-business marketers may not have as much data at their disposal as business-to-consumer marketers.

One other complication is that B2B marketers in targeting teams or &quot;accounts&quot; and not individuals may produce many contacts from a single organization. Determining which contact to communicate with through direct marketing may be difficult. On the other hand, it is the database for business-to-business marketers which often includes data on the business activity about the respective client.

These data become critical to segment markets or define target audiences, e.g. purchases of software license renewals by telecom companies could help identify which technologist is in charge of software installations vs. software procurement, etc. Customers in Business-to-Business environments often tend to be loyal since they need after-sales-service for their products and appreciate information on product upgrades and service offerings. This loyalty can be tracked by a database.

Sources of customer data often come from the sales force employed by the company and from the service engineers. Increasingly, online interactions with customers are providing B2B marketers with a lower cost source of customer information.

For prospect data, businesses can purchase data from compilers of business data, as well as gather information from their direct sales efforts, on-line sites, and specialty publications.

== Analytics and modeling ==
Companies with large databases of customer information risk being &quot;data rich and information poor.&quot; As a result, a considerable amount of attention is paid to the analysis of data. For instance, companies often segment their customers based on the analysis of differences in behavior, needs, or attitudes of their customers. A common method of behavioral segmentation is RFM (customer value), in which customers are placed into sub segments based on the recency, frequency, and monetary value of past purchases. Van den Poel (2003) gives an overview of the predictive performance of a large class of variables typically used in database-marketing modeling.

They may also develop predictive models, which forecast the propensity of customers to behave in certain ways. For instance, marketers may build a model that ranks customers on their likelihood to respond to a promotion. Commonly employed statistical techniques for such models include logistic regression and neural networks.

Other types of analysis include:
* Impact assessment helps a business to understand how actions taken by the business affected their customer behavior, and also allow for some predictions of customer reaction to proposed changes.

* Customers as assets measures the lifetime value of the customer base and allows businesses to measure several factors such as the cost of acquisition and the rate of churn.

* Cross-sell analysis identifies product and service relationships to better understand which are the most popular product combinations. Any identified relationships can then be used to cross-sell and up-sell in the future.

* Critical lag allows a business to deliver specific customer communications based on an individual&#x27;s purchase patterns, helping to increase loyalty and improve customer retention.

== Laws and regulations ==
As database marketing has grown, it has come under increased scrutiny from privacy advocates and government regulators. For instance, the European Commission has established a set of data protection rules that determine what uses can be made of customer data and how consumers can influence what data are retained. In the United States, there are a variety of state and federal laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA (which regulates the gathering and use of credit data), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (which regulates the gathering and use of consumer health data), and various programs that enable consumers to suppress their telephones numbers from telemarketing.

== Advances ==
While the idea of storing customer data in electronic formats to use them for database-marketing purposes has been around for decades, the computer systems available today make it possible to gain a comprehensive history of client behavior on-screen while the business is transacting with each individual, producing thus real-time business intelligence for the company. This ability enables what is called one-to-one marketing or personalization.

Today&#x27;s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems use the stored data not only for direct marketing purposes but to manage the complete relationship with individual customer contacts and to develop more customized product and service offerings. However, a combination of CRM, content management and business intelligence tools are making delivery of personalized information a reality.

Marketers trained in the use of these tools are able to carry out customer nurturing, which is a tactic that attempts to communicate with each individual in an organization at the right time, using the right information to meet that client&#x27;s need to progress through the process of identifying a problem, learning options available to resolve it, selecting the right solution, and making the purchasing decision.

Because of the complexities of B2B marketing and the intricacies of corporate operations, the demands placed on any marketing organization to formulate the business process by which such a sophisticated series of procedures may be brought into existence are significant. It is often for this reason that large marketing organizations engage the use of an expert in marketing process strategy and information technology (IT), or a marketing IT process strategist. Although more technical in nature than often marketers require, a system integrator (SI) can also play an equivalent role to the marketing IT process strategist, particularly at the time that new technology tools need to be configured and rolled out.

== Challenges and limitations ==
A major challenge for databases is the reality of obsolescence - including the lag time between when data was acquired and when the database is used.

<text>Up Holland (or Upholland) is a village in Skelmersdale and is a civil parish in the West Lancashire district, in the county of Lancashire, England, west of Wigan. The population at the 2011 census was 7,376.

==Geography==
The village is on a small hill 89m above sea level that rises above the West Lancashire Coastal Plain. There are views towards St Helens and Liverpool in the south west, Ormskirk and Southport in the north-west and towards Wigan, Manchester and on to the High Peak of Derbyshire in the east. The parish includes the Pimbo industrial estate.

==Etymology==
The place-name is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Hoiland&quot;. It appears as &quot;Upholand&quot; in a Lancashire Inquest of 1226. This is from the Old English , meaning &#x27;land on or by a hoe or spur of a hill&#x27;. The name Up Holland differentiates it from another place locally called Downholland, 10 miles to the west (on the other side of Ormskirk). The manor of Holland was a possession of the Holland family until 1534, whence it may be presumed they derived their name.

==Notable claims==
George Lyon, reputed to be one of the last English highwaymen, is said to be buried in the churchyard of the Anglican Church of St. Thomas the Martyr. The truth of the matter is that Lyon was little more than a common thief and receiver of stolen goods. The grave can be found under the concrete parapet opposite the White Lion pub.

A burial place of greater historical significance can be found at the south east corner of the church. Here, in a railed enclosure is the grave of Robert Daglish; a pioneer in steam locomotive engineering and design. In 1814, when George Stephenson was still working on his early locomotive &quot;Blucher&quot;, Daglish built &quot;The Yorkshire Horse,&quot; a &#x27;rack and pinion&#x27; locomotive to haul coal wagons at a nearby colliery. This proved to be a great success. Daglish went on to construct other locomotives and work on railway systems both in Great Britain and America.

Upholland railway station is on the Kirkby Branch Line.

==Religion==
===Anglican===
 The Anglican parish church of St Thomas the Martyr was, until the time of the Protestant Reformation, a Benedictine monastic foundation.

===Roman Catholic===
 The Roman Catholic parish church of St Theresa, College Road, is a fine building of 1955 by F. X. Velarde, &quot;one of the most unusual and innovative Catholic architects of the twentieth century&quot;.

 A Catholic seminary, St Joseph&#x27;s College, used for training Catholic priests, was once based in Up Holland. The college closed down in 1987 after over 150 years of serving the northern Catholic dioceses of England, and its extensive buildings are now derelict.

<doc id="627632" wikidata="Q1133795" url="?curid=627632" title="Tremé">
<text>Tremé ( ) is a neighborhood in New Orleans, Louisiana. &quot;Tremé&quot; is often rendered as Treme, and the neighborhood is sometimes called by its more formal French name, the Faubourg Tremé; it is listed in the New Orleans City Planning Districts as Tremé / Lafitte when including the Lafitte Projects.

Founded in the 1810s, it is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, and was initially the main neighborhood of its free people of color. Historically a racially mixed neighborhood, it remains an important center of the city&#x27;s African-American and Créole culture, especially the modern brass band tradition. Some sources go so far as to call it the oldest black-majority neighborhood in the U.S.

The Faubourg Tremé was created from land owned by Claude Tremé in 1810. A subdistrict of the Mid-City District Area, its boundaries as defined by the New Orleans City Planning Commission are Esplanade Avenue to the east, North Rampart Street to the south, St. Louis Street to the west and North Broad Street to the north.

==History==

The Tremé neighborhood began as the Morand Plantation and two forts—St. Ferdinand and St. John. Near the end of the 18th century, Claude Tremé purchased the land from the original plantation owner. By 1794 the Carondelet Canal was built from the French Quarter to Bayou St. John, splitting the land. Developers began building subdivisions throughout the area to house a diverse population that included Caucasians and free persons of color.

Tremé abuts the north, or lake, side of the French Quarter, away from the Mississippi River—&quot;back of town&quot; as earlier generations of New Orleanians used to say. Its traditional borders were Rampart Street on the south, Canal Street on the west, Esplanade Avenue on the east, and Broad Street on the north. Claiborne Avenue is a primary thoroughfare through the neighborhood. At the end of the 19th century, the Storyville red-light district was carved out of the upper part of Tremé; in the 1940s this was torn down and made into a public housing project. This area is no longer considered part of the neighborhood. The &quot;town square&quot; of Tremé was Congo Square—originally known as &quot;Place des Nègres&quot;—where slaves gathered on Sundays to dance. This tradition flourished until the United States took control, and officials grew more anxious about unsupervised gatherings of slaves in the years before the Civil War.
The square was also an important place of business for slaves, enabling some to purchase their freedom from selling crafts and goods there. For much of the rest of the 19th century, the square was an open-air market. &quot;Creoles of color&quot; brass and symphonic bands gave concerts, providing the foundation for a more improvisational style that would come to be known as &quot;Jazz&quot;. At the end of the 19th century, the city officially renamed the square &quot;Beauregard Square&quot; after the French Créole Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard, but the neighborhood people seldom used that name. Late in the 20th century, the city restored the traditional name of &quot;Congo Square&quot;.

In the early 1960s, in an urban renewal project later considered a mistake by most analysts, a large portion of central Tremé was torn down. The land stood vacant for some time, then in the 1970s the city created Louis Armstrong Park in the area and named Congo Square within Armstrong Park. In 1994, the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park was established here.

Musicians from Tremé include Doreen Ketchens, Alphonse Picou, Kermit Ruffins, Troy &quot;Trombone Shorty&quot; Andrews, Lucien Barbarin, and &quot;The King of Treme&quot; Shannon Powell. Additionally, comedian Mark Normand grew up in the neighborhood. While predominantly African-American, the population has been mixed from the 19th century through to the 21st. Jazz musicians of European ancestry such as Henry Ragas and Louis Prima also lived in Tremé. Also, Joe&#x27;s Cozy Corner in Tremé is often considered the birthplace of Rebirth Brass Band, one of the most notable current New Orleans bands. Alex Chilton, who led the rock groups Big Star and The Box Tops, lived in Tremé from the early 1990s until his death in 2010.
During Hurricane Katrina, the Tremé neighborhood suffered minor to moderate flooding. In the portion of the neighborhood in from I-10, the water was generally not high enough to damage many of the old raised homes. The neighborhood demographics have changed in recent years due to gentrification and the proliferation of short-term rentals such as Airbnb.

==African-American heritage sites==

Located in Tremé, the New Orleans African American Museum is dedicated to protecting, preserving, and promoting through education the history, art, and communities of African Americans in New Orleans and the African diaspora. It is listed on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail, as is the community&#x27;s St. Augustine Church — the oldest African-American Catholic parish in the U.S..

<text>U.S. Route 19 or U.S. Highway 19 (US 19) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway in the Eastern United States. Despite encroaching Interstate Highways, the route has remained a long-haul road, connecting the Gulf of Mexico with Lake Erie.

The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is at Memphis, Florida, which is just south of St. Petersburg at an intersection with US 41. Its northern terminus is in Erie, Pennsylvania, at an intersection with US 20 about from the shores of Lake Erie.

The length of the highway is , including both US 19E/US 19W paths through North Carolina and Tennessee.

===Florida===

US 19 runs along Florida&#x27;s west coast from an interchange with US 41 in Memphis, south of St. Petersburg, and continues to the Georgia border north of Monticello. US 19 remains independent of Interstate 75 (I-75), even as the routes converge in the Tampa Bay area. The route is cosigned with I-275 over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge over the mouth of Tampa Bay, US 98 between the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge and Perry, US 27 Alternate (US 27 Alt.) between Chiefland and Perry, and US 27 between and Perry and Capps.

The unsigned designation for US 19 in Florida, between Memphis and Perry, is State Road 55 (SR 55). Between Perry and Capps, it follows SR 20, and, between Capps and the Georgia border, it follows SR 57.

According to a 2005 &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; report, part of US 19 in Florida may be the most dangerous road in the U.S. A Highway Patrol test period beginning in 1998 and ending in 2003, as mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, showed the stretch of US 19 from Pasco to Pinellas county to average approximately 52 deaths a year, or 262 deaths in the five-year duration of the study; 100 of these deaths were pedestrian related, making US 19 the worst road to walk on in these two counties. Multiple efforts to improve US 19 have been suggested to the Florida Department of Transportation, among them, an overpass strictly for left-turn lanes.

Currently, US 19 between Clearwater and St. Petersburg is getting a freeway-style upgrade due to the cancelation of an extension of I-375 in the late 1970s.

===Georgia===

US 19 enters Georgia just south of Thomasville as Lee Highway, concurrent with State Route 3 (SR 3). It continues north, passing through Albany, Americus, Ellaville, Butler, Thomaston, and Zebulon. It becomes concurrent with US 41 in Griffin. It then proceeds through the western tip of Henry County, passing through Hampton, home of Atlanta Motor Speedway, and continues north through Clayton County and Jonesboro, entering Atlanta.

US 19/US 41 travels through the south side of Atlanta as Metropolitan Parkway (formerly Stewart Avenue) and through Downtown Atlanta as Northside Drive. The concurrencies with US 41 and SR 3 end when US 19 turns east onto 14th Street in Midtown, beginning a concurrency with SR 9. It then turns north on Peachtree Street until it intersects with SR 141 in Buckhead and becomes Roswell Road. US 19 then continues north through Sandy Springs until it reaches I-285&#x27;s north side. There, the concurrency with SR 9 ends and US 19 is briefly concurrent with I-285, for about .

US 19 leaves I-285 to travel through the northern suburbs of Atlanta along SR 400. Most of this section is a limited-access road with four lanes in each direction, becoming two lanes in each direction as the highway continues away from the northern suburbs of Atlanta. It picks back up as Lee Highway north of Atlanta. It arrives in Dahlonega, where it is no longer concurrent with SR 400, before about of extremely curvy road, which includes a concurrency with US 129. The last major town it travels through in Georgia is Blairsville.

===North Carolina===
US 19 is cosigned with US 129 from the Georgia line to Murphy as Lee Highway, then is cosigned with US 74, as well as US 129 as far as Graham County. US 129 vears away from US 19, heading north to Robbinsville, and continuing to Maryville, Tennessee. US 19 and US 74 are cosigned as far as Ela, after which US 74 veers south, leaving US 19 to head into the Great Smoky Mountains. US 19 passes through the Qualla Boundary. For a brief time, US 19 is cosigned with US 276. Then, US 19 is cosigned with US 23 from Lake Junaluska to Mars Hill (and with US 70 in Asheville), which closely parallels I-40 and then Future I-26.

Just north of Mars Hill, US 19 continues solo to Cane River, where US 19 splits: US 19E toward Burnsville and US 19W toward Erwin, Tennessee.

===U.S. Route 19E===

Traversing from Cane River, North Carolina, to Bluff City, Tennessee, US 19E first goes east to Burnsville and Spruce Pine, then north along the banks of the North Toe River to Cranberry and Elk Park, before crossing the North Carolina–Tennessee state line. Heading northeast, it goes through Roan Mountain, Hampton, and Elizabethton, rendezvousing with US 19W in Bluff City.

===U.S. Route 19W===
Traversing from Cane River, North Carolina, to Bluff City, Tennessee, US 19W goes immediately north along the banks of the Cane River to the communities of Ramseytown and Sioux, then northwest through the Unaka Range, crossing the North Carolina–Tennessee state line. At Ernestville, US 19W joins with I-26/US 23 and proceeds through Erwin, Unicoi, and Johnson City. In Johnson City, it switches partners to US 11E along Bristol Highway, rendezvousing with US 19E in Bluff City.

===Tennessee===

US 19 starts again in Bluff City, heading northeast along the Volunteer Parkway (and concurrency with US 11E) to Bristol. In downtown Bristol, US 19 crosses the Tennessee–Virginia state line on State Street.

===Virginia===

US 19 goes northeast from Bristol, parallel to I-81, until Abingdon. It then heads north to Lebanon, through Clinch Mountain, then northeast again through the towns of Claypool Hill, Tazewell, and then finally to Bluefield, where it enters West Virginia.

===West Virginia===

US 19 enters West Virginia as a four-lane highway in Bluefield, where it narrows to two lanes as it winds northward. It later parallels I-77/I-64 until it reaches Beckley, where it goes northeasterly on an expressway-grade four-lane highway. Crossing the New River via the New River Gorge Bridge near Fayetteville, it passes through Summersville and Birch River before arriving at I-79, south of Sutton. From there, it runs concurrent with I-79 from exit 57 to exit 67 at Flatwoods. Then, it exits and reverts to a two-lane highway, more or less following the route of I-79 as it passes through Weston, Clarksburg, Fairmont, and Morgantown before crossing into Pennsylvania. The distance from Beckley from I-79 is also known as Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) Corridor L. It allows traffic to the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area to bypass Charleston, and is thus part of a main link from Charlotte, North Carolina, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Pittsburgh.

===Pennsylvania===

US 19 is closely paralleled by I-79 for its entire length. From the state line, it goes north to Washington and then through Pittsburgh. In Downtown Pittsburgh, US 19 crosses the Ohio River via West End Bridge. In Cranberry Township, north of Pittsburgh, US 19 shares a major junction between I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and I-79, via the Cranberry Connector. US 19 crosses I-80 in the East Lackawannock Township. Near Erie, it crosses I-90 before going through the downtown area, ending at US 20 (26th Street).

===ADHS corridors===
US 19 overlaps with three corridors that are part of the ADHS, which is part of Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). Passed in 1965, the purpose of the ADHS is to generate economic development in previously isolated areas, supplement the Interstate Highway System, connect Appalachia to the Interstate System, and provide access to areas within the region as well as to markets in the rest of the nation.

* Corridor A – From I-285, in Sandy Springs, Georgia, to I-40, near Clyde, North Carolina. US 19/SR 400 overlaps from Sandy Springs to SR 141, near Cumming in Georgia. The entire section is a controlled-access highway.
* Corridor A-1 – From SR 141, near Cumming, Georgia, to SR 53, near Dawsonville, Georgia. The entire section of US 19/SR 400 is authorized for ADHS funding. The entire route is a divided four-lane highway, with the southern section a controlled-access highway and the northern section being a limited-access road.
* Corridor K – From I-75, in Cleveland, Tennessee, to US 23, in Dillsboro, North Carolina. US 19 overlaps from US 64/US 74, near Murphy, to US 74 (Great Smoky Mountains Expressway), near Bryson City. The routing is a four-lane limited-access road from near Murphy to Andrews; the rest is two-lane through the Nantahala Gorge. Future plans include building a new four-lane limited-access road from Andrews, through Robbinsville, to Stecoah, bypassing the Nantahala Gorge.
* Corridor L – From I-64/I-77, near Beckley, West Virginia, to I-79, near Sutton, West Virginia. Of the section of US 19, only was authorized for ADHS funding. This corridor is considered complete, with a divided four-lane limited-access road with interchanges at major intersections.
* Corridor Q – From US 23/US 119, in Shelbiana, Kentucky, to I-81, near Christiansburg, Virginia. US 19 overlaps from US 460, in Claypool Hill, Virginia, to US 460, in Princeton, West Virginia. The entire route is a mostly divided four lane limited-access road with interchanges at major intersections.
==History==
===Florida===
US 19 first entered Florida in 1929. It underwent two route shifts, the first in 1933 and the second in 1946, which adjusted it to its current alignment. US 19 was extended to its southern terminus of Memphis in September 1954, when the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened to traffic.

Starting around 1956, US 19 was four-laned, initially in the Perry area, working north toward the Georgia border. The entire route in Florida was four-laned by 1972.

The planned St. Petersburg–Clearwater Expressway, or Pinellas Beltway, would have followed the current alignment of US 19 Alt. from I-275 to Clearwater, Florida. The intersection of Seminole Boulevard and Bay Pines Boulevard is a remnant of this proposed road. The beltway road was proposed in 1974, but it was dead by 1980.

===North Carolina===
In North Carolina, US 19 was North Carolina Highway 10 (NC 10) from the Georgia state line to Asheville, NC 29 from Asheville to Madison County, NC 69 to a point near the Tennessee state line, and either NC 194 or NC 694 for a short distance south of the Tennessee state line.

The original US 19 in Yancey, Mitchell, and Avery counties mostly followed the route now designated US 19E. US 19W in Yancey County was US 19-23 in 1935, and what is now US 19E was US 19A. The US 19E and US 19W designations have been used since 1930.

Prior to 1948, US 19 between Ela and Waynesville essentially followed the route of present-day US 74. Then, this road was called US 19A and the section of NC 28. From Ela to Cherokee and the section of NC 293 from Cherokee to near Waynesville became US 19. Improvements were made, including a new section of highway west of Lake Junaluska.

Around 1956, US 19/US 23 was widened to four lanes from Lake Junaluska to Canton.

By 1970, a section of US 19 west of Murphy, also designated US 64 (and later US 74), was widened to four lanes.

In January 1983, after improvements to US 19A had made it similar to an Interstate Highway, the state proposed designating US 19A as US 19 Bypass. At one point, changing US 19A to US 19 was considered, but businesses in Maggie Valley opposed the idea of their highway being changed to US 19A. US 19A became the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway.

===Tennessee===
US 19 originally went from the North Carolina state line to US 511. In 1928, US 19 was extended with US 511 to Bristol and into Virginia. In 1930, US 19 south was truncated to Bluff City (the current State Route 44 [SR 44]/SR 390 junction), as US 19E was assigned to US 19 south to North Carolina.

This is still US 19E except Old Highway 19E/Buck Creek Road east of Shell Creek; Carter Street, Main Street, Conway Street, and Cloud Land Drive in Roan Mountain; Crabtree and Old Rock Quarry roads west of Roan Mountain; Little Mountain Church Road; Holtsclaw Road; Herman Johnson Loop; J D Whitehead Road; Old Highway 19E, Schoolhouse Road, and Dave Simerly Road in Tiger Valley; Rittertown Road south of Hampton; Church and 1st streets through Hampton; and Mill Pond Road in the Valley Forge area.

The quite winding alignment where it crosses the Doe River twice is completely abandoned; State Line Road/Johnson Avenue/Sycamore Street/Broad Street through Elizabethton, plus today&#x27;s SR 400 and Bristol/Elizabethton/Old Elizabethton highways to Bluff City.

In 1931 or 1932, US 19 south was extended over US 19W to the new US 19E/US 19W split in Hillcrest (the current SR 44/Elizabethton Highway junction)

===Virginia===
Although an original U.S. Highway, US 19 does not appear on the 1926 official road atlas (which shows other U.S. Highways) nor the 1927 Clason road atlas. It does appear on a mid-1927 official map. It ran generally as it does today. In this routing, US 19 was added to US 11 and State Route 10 (SR 10) from the Tennessee state line to Abingdon, SR 106 from Abingdon to Hansonville, SR 112 from Hansonville to Lebanon, and SR 11 from Lebanon to the West Virginia state line.

Initially, US 19 entered Virginia via Pennsylvania Avenue in Bristol, Tennessee, then used State Street west to Front Street north to Spencer Street northeast to Mary Street east to Goodson Street north to Danville Avenue east to Fairview Street north to Massachusetts Avenue east to Texas Avenue north, which became Old Abingdon Highway ran back into US 11/US 19 near the I-81 interchange.

US 19 followed today&#x27;s US 11 approaching Abingdon, then used Colonial Avenue and crossed the railroad to modern US 11 at roughly the Bytt Street location, then US 58 Alt. northwest. US 19 followed today&#x27;s US 19/US 58 Alt. to Hansonville except SR 766 near Abingdon, SR 633 loop at Butts, SR 775 at Greendale, and SR 876/SR 802 at Holton.

Leaving Hansonville, US 19 used today&#x27;s US 19 up to SR 674, then abandoned alignment on the north side to Sunset Drive, US 19, SR 841 (except initially used SR 758 loop) to US 19 Business (US 19 Bus.), some of US 19 Bus., Gilbert Street/Old Fincastle Road, SR 82, and US 19 Bus. through Lebanon.

East of Lebanon, US 19 used SR 656 loop back to US 19. After a brief stretch of today&#x27;s US 19, US 19 followed the SR 872 loop near SR 80 eastbound. US 19 followed more of today&#x27;s US 19 but near SR 80 westbound stayed north of the creek on Old Rosedale Highway and some abandoned alignments until around SR 644. East of here, US 19 more closely followed it current path although in the field it appears old alignment pieces are visible to the north side.

Before SR 369, US 19 originally used SR 770 to cross into Tazewell County, then SR 609 north back to US 19. US 19 followed its current path to Claypool Hill except it used the SR 705 loop. At Pounding Mill, US 19 used SR 637 but otherwise followed US 19/US 460 and then US 19 Bus./US 460 Bus. to SR 16 Alt.

Initially, US 19 followed Old Fincastle Turnpike in western Tazewell, then current US 19 Bus. through Tazewell, then Ben Bolt Road east to SR 61. US 19 then followed SR 61 north to SR 678 (Market Street). US 19 followed SR 678 north to SR 645 east which used to connect back to modern US 19/US 460.

US 19 followed today&#x27;s US 19 to Bluefield, West Virginia, except SR 781, SR 680 loops in Springville, SR 665, and SR 744/SR 1520 Shannandale. There are other visible unnumbered loops that are visible to the north side of US 19/US 460. In Bluefield, US 19 used Greever and East streets.

===West Virginia===
Appeared in December 1926 as an original U.S. Highway, replacing West Virginia Route 4 (WV 4) from Bluefield to Westover and WV 30 from Westover to Pennsylvania.

The original description of US 19 in the 1925 West Virginia Department of Transportation (WVDOT) annual report had US 19 ending at US 60 in Gauley Bridge and the 1926 official maps of both Virginia and West Virginia show this, but, by the time the U.S. Numbered Highway System went live in late 1926, US 19 did extend all the way through West Virginia.

The road from Beckwith to US 60 was completed as new construction in 1926. It is unclear if US 19 was briefly part of the old route via Kanawha Falls which became part of WV 61 (now County Route 13, or CR 13).

In 1929, US 19 was rerouted at Belva to the current WV 39 crossing of Twentymile Creek. The old route used today&#x27;s CR 16/6 which no longer crosses the railroad and abandoned routing northwest to the Creek crossing which remained many decades past but is now gone along WV 16 north of the WV 39 junction.

In about 1931, according to that year&#x27;s WVDOT annual report, US 19/US 21 was removed from CR 19/19 (Cherry Creek Circle) and CR 119/8 (Lamar Circle) in Cherry Creek; CR 19/17 (Marshall Circle) all between Ghent and Shady Spring; also CR 19/28 (Ransom Drive), CR 119/20 (Little Vine Drive), and CR 19/14. Old US 19 loops above Shady Spring.

Also, in about 1931, according to that year&#x27;s WVDOT annual report, US 19/US 21 was rebuilt from Skelton to Mount Hope and removed from CR 19/5 and CR 4 (Prosperity Road) through Prosperity; CR 16/68 (Bradley School Road); and CR 19/1 (Maple Lane; no longer connects to), CR 1/25, CR 19/43 (Sherwood Road), and CR 21/8 (Sherwood Heights Road).

In about 1934, US 19 was given a new routing between Bluefield and Princeton. The old route became CR 25 (Old Princeton Road) out of Bluefield; CR 25 (Mercer Mall Road) to Edison (some of this is now WV 123); WV 71 legs (now CR 19/33 [Maple Acres Road] to Glenwood; Glenwood/Green Valley/Old Bluefield roads [CR 19/29] from Glenwood to Princeton).

Also, in about 1934, according to that year&#x27;s WVDOT annual report, the original Beckley Bypass was completed. It is referred to as &quot;Alternate Route&quot; through at least 1936. Then, by 1940, it appears mainline US 19 was moved onto it, leaving behind US 19 Alt. (now WV 16, CR 21/5, more WV 16, and all of WV 210) through Beckley.

Also, in about 1934, according to that year&#x27;s WVDOT annual report, US 19/US 21 was put on mostly new construction from Oak Hill to Fayetteville, leaving behind CR 19/2 (Broadway Avenue) and CR 19/1 (Nickelville Road).

In about 1935, according to that year&#x27;s WVDOT annual report, US 19/US 21 was removed from Covington and Piney Creek roads near Raleigh (south edge of Beckley)

Also, in about 1935, according to that year&#x27;s WVDOT annual report, US 19/US 21 was put on new construction between Glen Jean and Oak Hill leaving behind CR 20 (now CR 21/20) from Glen Jean to Whipple Junction and CR 15 from Whipple Junction to Oak Hill.

Also, in about 1935, according to that year&#x27;s WVDOT annual report, US 19/US 21 was removed from CR 21/4 (Old Court Street) north of Fayetteville.

Also, in about 1935, according to that year&#x27;s WVDOT annual report, US 19 was removed from Colasessano Drive which no longer crosses Buffalo Creek to Old Pennsylvania Avenue north of Fairmont.

In about 1936, according to that year&#x27;s WVDOT annual report, US 19/US 21 was removed from today&#x27;s CR 119/6 (Sheloh Circle) and CR 119/2 (Madoc Circle) in Cool Ridge.

In 1936 or 1937, US 19 was removed from CR 19/9 and CR 19/10 (Robinson Run Road) in Bowlby.

Between 1947 and 1949, US 19 was rerouted to run directly from Beckley to Summersville as an addition to WV 41. The old route through Fayetteville to Gauley Bridge remained part of US 21 (now WV 16 except US 19 used WV 211 through Mount Hope) while Gauley River to Summersville became an extended WV 39.

===Pennsylvania===
For many years, the Venango Path was a Native American trail between the Forks of the Ohio (present day Pittsburgh) and Presque Isle Bay. This trail follows modern US 19 from Pittsburgh across the Allegheny River to Perrysville. It continues to Wexford and crosses Brush Creek at Warrendale. Here, the path and modern road separate for a time. The path goes across fields while the road parallels it—from a distance of to the west—for about to Ogle.

US 19 in Pennsylvania has maintained a similar alignment for much of its history. In 1928, US 19 was moved to its current route between Pittsburgh and Meadville. The West End Bridge in Pittsburgh was completed in 1932, and US 19 was realigned to cross the bridge. In 1936, US 19 was moved to its current alignment between Zelienople and Harmony. Through the 1940s and 1950s, different parts of US 19 were widened.

In 1987, the Phase One project started to connect two sections of Ohio River Boulevard near Western Avenue and Chateau Street. Phase Two of the project included a new interchange between the Pennsylvania Route 65 (PA 65) expressway (concurrent with US 19 west of the interchange) and the West End Bridge. The bridge was closed for two years for construction but reopened in 1991 while construction finished in 1992.

In 2003, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) started a project to build a US 19 tunnel under the Norfolk Southern Railway, as well as align the West End Bypass with the West End Circle, the intersection of US 19, PA 51, PA 60, and PA 837. The project was completed in 2010.

In 2016, a diverging diamond interchange was built at the intersection of US 19 and I-70/I-79 in South Strabane Township.

PennDOT has started construction on a multilane roundabout at the intersection of US 6, US 19, US 322, and PA 98 in Vernon Township, near Meadville. Construction was expected to be completed in October 2019.

PennDOT has also started construction on an intersection improvement project at the northern intersection of US 19 and PA 97. PA 97 were realigned to meet US 19 at a 90-degree angle, and new left-turn lanes and traffic signals were installed. Construction was expected to be completed in October 2019.

<text>The [[Faubourg]] Marigny ( ; sometimes called The Marigny) is a neighborhood of the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.

Its boundaries, as defined by the City Planning Commission, are North Rampart Street and St. Claude Avenue to the north, the railroad tracks along Homer Plessy Way (formerly Press Street) to the east, the Mississippi River to the south, and Esplanade Avenue to the west.

==Geography==
The Faubourg Marigny is located at and has an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of . of which is land and (6.06%) of which is water.

In the 19th century, the Faubourg Marigny was the old Third Municipality of New Orleans. The triangular area between Esplanade and Elysian Fields Avenue is sometimes called the &quot;Marigny Triangle&quot; and is part of the 7th Ward of New Orleans. The remainder is in the 8th and 9th wards of New Orleans.

===Adjacent neighborhoods===
* Seventh Ward (north)
* St. Roch (north)
* Bywater (east)
* French Quarter (west)

===Boundaries===
The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of the Faubourg Marigny as: North Rampart Street, St. Claude Avenue, the railroad tracks along Homer Plessy Way (formerly Press Street), the Mississippi River, and Esplanade Avenue.

===South 7th Ward===
In 2013, the neighborhood corresponding to U.S. census tract 27, bound by N. Claiborne Avenue, Elysian Fields Avenue, St. Claude Avenue, and St. Bernard Avenue, was given the name South 7th Ward, by a consensus vote of residents of the area, following several public meetings of the neighborhood&#x27;s neighbor organization.

===New Marigny===
The area farther back from the new Rampart/St. Claude street car to I-10 is considered &quot;New Marigny&quot;, the name dating to the early 19th century. The lower boundary, with the Bywater neighborhood, is either Press Street (a traditional boundary along the railroad tracks) or Franklin Avenue (the upper boundary of the city&#x27;s 9th Ward).

The New Marigny Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The area contains parts of the 7th and 8th wards as well as the Faubourg Saint Roch and the upriver part of the Faubourg Saint Claude.
Formerly part of a plantation, this area was developed by Creole landowner Bernard de Marigny, beginning in the early 19th century. He divided his plantation and sold the lots in an 1806 subdivision, the Faubourg Marigny. They sold so quickly that he extended the development four years later. Sales of the affordable, modest-sized lots were spurred in 1831 when the Pontchartrain Railroad, or “Smoky Mary,” began running on Elysian Fields Avenue.

Development of the area downriver of Elysian Fields Avenue followed when the Faubourg Franklin was laid out in 1834. This neighborhood, like the portion of the Faubourg Marigny located across St. Claude Avenue, was settled primarily by Louisiana Creoles of color and German immigrants between the 1830s and 1880s.

Several musicians either grew up in the neighborhood or moved here as adults. Ferdinand LaMothe, better known as Jelly Roll Morton, would sneak away from his upright Creole grandmother&#x27;s home, just off Elysian Fields Avenue, to play piano in the red light district of Storyville. Sidney Bechet, Manny Perez, Danny Barker, and Paul Barbarin, all giants of New Orleans music, made their homes in the neighborhood.

In the 21st century, this area is the site of both funk palaces such as the Saturn Bar on St. Claude Avenue and 19th-century icons such as the St. Roch Market. This is one of the last surviving public market buildings in New Orleans. The independent Circle Market at 1522 St. Bernard Avenue continues to thrive despite competition from national grocery chains.

Longstanding oaks line St. Roch and Elysian Fields avenues, where Creole cottages and shotgun houses are being renovated and painted. A public park is being developed for the formerly industrial Press Street corridor.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 3,145 people, 1,960 households, and 391 families residing in the neighborhood. The population density was 10,145 /mi² (3,931 /km²).

As of the census of 2010, there were 2,973 people, 1,881 households, and 359 families residing in the neighborhood.

==History==
===19th century origins===
The Faubourg Marigny was laid out in the first decade of the 19th century by Creole real estate developer and politician Bernard de Marigny, on land that had been his family&#x27;s plantation just downriver from the old city limits of New Orleans.

The portion of the Faubourg Marigny closer to the river was built up first; the area on the side of St. Claude Avenue (formerly &quot;Goodchildren Street&quot;) away from the river was sometimes called the &quot;New Marigny&quot;. In the early 19th century, the New Marigny was where white Creole gentlemen set up households for their mistresses of color (and their offspring) in the tradition of &quot;plaçage.&quot;

Wide Elysian Fields Avenue, named after the Champs-Élysées in Paris, was designed to be the main street of the faubourg. It was the first street in the New Orleans area to extend directly from the riverfront to Lake Pontchartrain away. In 1830-31 the Pontchartrain Railroad was built, with its tracks down the center of Elysian Fields. (The area at the other end of the rail line developed into Milneburg.)

===20th century &amp; beyond===
The neighborhood declined badly in the mid-20th century, and the area around Washington Square was nicknamed &quot;Little Angola&quot; (after the prison of that name) for the dangerous criminals there. After Hurricane Betsy many Filipino Americans who had been displaced by the hurricane called the neighborhood home. It came back strongly in the late 20th century.

Profiteering related to the 1984 World&#x27;s Fair drove many long-term French Quarter residents into the Marigny. Frenchmen Street developed one of the city&#x27;s premier locations for live music venues and restaurants and is a destination for music devotees. The neighborhood is also home to the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts riverfront facility.

The Faubourg Marigny is one of the city&#x27;s most colorful neighborhoods; the architecture borrows heavily from the colonial French and Spanish and has elements of the Caribbean. This blending of cultures over time has resulted in a unique architectural style. The Marigny is one of the centers for homegrown New Orleans Mardi Gras (see Faubourg Marigny Mardi Gras costumes).

====Hurricane Katrina recovery====
Hurricane Katrina of late August 2005, which had a disastrous effect on most of New Orleans, had a less severe aftermath here. The section on the Mississippi River side of Rampart experienced some wind damage, but it was at a high enough elevation to escape the great flood. The lower-lying areas of New Marigny flooded, but not as deeply as elsewhere. A good portion of the 19th-century-style raised houses were elevated enough so that the flood waters did not do significant damage, even as far back as Claiborne Avenue.

A free community kitchen and goods-exchange camp was set up in Washington Square for a couple of months after the storm. The official reopening of the Marigny was delayed in September and early October 2005 because initial decisions were made to reopen areas by ZIP code and the Faubourg Marigny shared a ZIP code with more badly-damaged areas. After reopening, the area rebounded quickly.

==Education==
The neighborhood is in the New Orleans Public Schools district.

The former Colton Middle School in Faubourg Marigny is now a Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) charter school, in the KIPP New Orleans Schools network.

<text>Northeast Malakula, or Uripiv-Wala-Rano-Atchin, is a dialect chain spoken on the islands of Uripiv, Wala, Rano, and Atchin and on the mainland opposite to these islands. Uripiv-Wala-Rano-Atchin is spoken today by about 9,000 people. Literacy rate of its speakers in their own language is 10–30%.

Uripiv-Wala-Rano-Atchin forms a dialect chain. The Uripiv dialect is the most southerly of these and has 85% of its words in common with Atchin, the most northerly dialect. Uripiv is spoken on the north-east coast of Malakula.

The Uripiv dialect is one of the few documented languages that use the rare bilabial trill, a feature that is not found in the Atchin dialect.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
* The sound is considered rare, and its phonemic status is unclear.

* Some speakers may pronounce sounds /s, ts/ as [ʃ, tʃ] in free variation.

=== Vowels ===

:* Sounds /e, o, œ/ are heard as [ɛ, ɔ, ə] in unstressed closed-syllable position.

<text>Ousmane Issoufi Maïga (born 1946) was the Prime Minister of Mali from 2004 to 2007. Issoufi had previously held several ministerial posts in previous governments.

Issoufi was born near Gao, in the north of Mali. He studied economics at the University of Kyiv (Ukraine ― at the time part of the USSR) and then at the American University in Washington, DC, where he graduated with a degree in banking and finance. He has worked for the World Bank and in the French Ministry of Finance, where he was Assistant Director of the &quot;Caisse autonome d’amortissement&quot; (Autonomous Debt Financing Fund).

Following the ouster of Moussa Traoré in March 1991, Maïga became Minister in charge of the State &quot;Contrôle Général&quot; in the transitional government. He later became Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance before being appointed Minister of Youth and Sports on June 23, 2001. In this position, he organised Mali&#x27;s hosting of the African Nations Cup in 2002.

After the election of Amadou Toumani Touré as President, Issoufi became Minister of the Economy and Finance on June 14, 2002, serving under Prime Minister Ahmed Mohamed ag Hamani. Subsequently, in the government named on October 16, 2002, he became Minister of Equipment and Transport.

He remained Minister of Equipment and Transport until he was named Prime Minister on April 29, 2004. After Touré was sworn in for a second term as President, Maïga presented his resignation on June 9, 2007, but Touré asked the government to remain in place. Following the July 2007 parliamentary election, he again presented his government&#x27;s resignation, which Touré accepted, on September 27, 2007. Touré thanked him for his work as Prime Minister and appointed Modibo Sidibé as his successor on September 28.

<doc id="627691" wikidata="Q2107961" url="?curid=627691" title="Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D">
<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D is an early turbofan aircraft engine derived from the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet. It was first run in 1958 and was first flown in 1959 under a B-45 Tornado test aircraft. Over 8,000 JT3Ds were produced between 1959 and 1985. Most JT3D engines still in service today are used on military aircraft, where the engine is referred to by its US military designation of TF33.

==Design and development==
Aware of the competition from the Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan, Pratt &amp; Whitney decided to develop the JT3D turbofan from the JT3C turbojet for later deliveries of the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, then nearing entry into service. A 2-stage fan replaced the first 3 stages of the 9-stage JT3C LP compressor. On the LP turbine, the second stage was enlarged and a third stage added.

Unlike GE with the CJ805-23, Pratt &amp; Whitney had not undertaken any transonic fan research prior to designing the JT3D, so they were unable to incorporate a single stage unit into the specification. Instead P&amp;W designed a 2-stage unit based on some research they had done to support the J91 nuclear turbojet.

On the Boeing 707 the JT3D fan nacelle was relatively short, whereas the Douglas DC-8 installation had a full-length fan cowl. Pratt &amp; Whitney provided a kit whereby JT3Cs could be converted to the JT3D specification, and performance, during an overhaul.

In 1959, important orders for the engine were the Boeing 707-120B and Boeing 720B when American Airlines ordered one 707 powered by JT3D turbofans and KLM ordered a JT3D-powered Douglas DC-8. Earlier 707s and DC-8s had been powered by the JT3C and JT4A turbojets, and the improved efficiency of the turbofan soon attracted the airlines. A JT3D-powered 707-123B and 720-023B (the suffix B was to indicate a turbofan-powered aircraft) entered service with American Airlines on the same day, March 12, 1961.

The Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers were all originally powered by turbojet engines. With the demise of many airline 707s, the United States Air Force took the opportunity to buy the surplus airframes and use the engines to re-fit the KC-135As used by the Air National Guard and reserve squadrons with the civilian JT3D (designated TF33-PW-102). Over 150 aircraft were modified and the former KC-135A was re-designated the KC-135E.

After long service for both airlines and air forces, the number of JT3D-powered aircraft is steadily decreasing. One hundred thirty five KC-135s use the JT3D, while 354 were fitted with CFM International CFM56 engines, which provide greater thrust, lower fuel consumption, and increased operational flexibility due to their lower noise footprint. The noise of the JT3D is one of the reasons NATO has debated re-fitting their E-3 Sentry AWACS fleet, since the aircraft are subject to restrictions that aircraft with modern engines are not. Operational flexibility would be further increased due to the ability of higher power engines to increase the ceiling of the aircraft, extending the horizon for radar surveillance; for instance, RAF, French and Saudi E-3s routinely fly higher than NATO/USAF counterparts.

In 1961, the TF33-powered Boeing B-52H Stratofortress entered service. The &quot;H&quot; model of the B-52 was the only production variant of the heavy bomber to be fitted with turbofan engines, and is the only model remaining in United States Air Force service. It is expected to remain as a mainstay of the Air Force heavy bomber fleet until at least 2040, with options for replacing the 8 TF33 engines with more modern equivalents being considered. In April 2020, the USAF released a request for proposals for 608 commercial replacement engines, with the plan to award the contract in May 2021. In September 2021, the USAF announced that the TF33 would be replaced by the Rolls-Royce F130.

<text>Force Reconnaissance (FORECON) are United States Marine Corps reconnaissance units that provide amphibious reconnaissance, deep ground reconnaissance, surveillance, battle-space shaping and limited scale raids in support of a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), other Marine air-ground task forces or a joint force. Although FORECON companies are conventional forces they share many of the same tactics, techniques, procedures and equipment of special operations forces. During large-scale operations, Force Reconnaissance companies report to the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and provide direct action and deep reconnaissance. Though commonly misunderstood to refer to reconnaissance-in-force, the name &quot;Force&quot; Recon refers to the unit&#x27;s relationship with the Marine Expeditionary Force or Marine Air-Ground Task Force. Force reconnaissance platoons formed the core composition of the initial creation of the Marine Special Operations Teams (MSOTs) found in Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) Raider battalions, though Marine Raiders now have their own separate and direct training pipeline.

A force recon detachment has, since the mid-1980s, formed part of a specialized sub-unit, of either a Marine expeditionary unit (special operations capable) (MEU(SOC)) or a Marine expeditionary unit (MEU), known as the Maritime Special Purpose Force (MSPF) for a MEU(SOC) and as the Maritime Raid Force (MRF) for a MEU.

==Mission==
The mission of Force Reconnaissance is to conduct amphibious reconnaissance, deep ground reconnaissance, surveillance, battle-space shaping and limited scale raids in support of the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), other Marine air-ground task forces or a joint force. These responsibilities can generally be divided into two operational mission sets: &quot;green&quot; operations (reconnaissance) and &quot;black&quot; operations (direct action). Force Recon is not part of the United States Special Operations Command, and are conventional forces, not special operations forces. The Force Recon platoons operate farther inland than their Division Recon counterparts, penetrating deeper into enemy territory from their assigned littoral (coastal) region within a force commander&#x27;s tactical area of responsibility (TAOR), often at ranges beyond the support of friendly artillery and/or naval gunfire support (NGFS).

=== Reconnaissance vs. Direct Action ===
Two mission sets emerged during the Vietnam War: &quot;Key Hole&quot; (deep reconnaissance) and &quot;Sting Ray&quot; (direct action). &quot;Key Hole&quot; patrols were designed purely around reconnaissance and surveillance. Usually lightly equipped and armed with defensive weapons, they employ evasive techniques to break away from the enemy should the need arise; avoiding enemy contact is paramount. Conversely, Sting Ray operations had goals more closely in line of offensive strikes. In a Sting Ray operation, the FORECON operators were heavily armed and use artillery and/or naval gunfire support, if available. However, what began as a &#x27;keyhole&#x27; patrol could become a &#x27;stingray&#x27; patrol with little warning. The versatility of FORECON is demonstrated through switching between deep reconnaissance patrols to direct action engagements in certain situations.

===Green operations===
Green operations are the principal mission of Force Recon, to collect any pertinent intelligence of military importance, observe, identify and report adversaries to MAGTF commanders. Like Division Recon (also known as the Marine Recon Battalions), they employ a mixed element of amphibious reconnaissance and ground reconnaissance. This practice fundamentally covers a wide spectrum of reconnaissance but primarily the FORECON operators conduct deep reconnaissance. Their reconnaissance missions include preliminary (or &quot;pre–D-Day&quot;) and post-assault reconnaissance. Some examples are:
* Battle damage assessment (BDA) missions – Witnessing and reporting damage to targets, either from heavy support fire measures (artillery and naval gunfire), air strikes, or thermonuclear weapons.
* Remote sensors operations – Placing remote sensors and beacons is vital for marking friendly/hostile boundaries and areas for helicopter assault and infantry transport. 
* Initial terminal guidance (ITG)–setting up/preparing landing zones (LZ) and drop zones (DZ) for forward operating sites, Marine fixed or rotary-wing aircraft, or waterborne locations (landing force, ship-to-shore).

===Black operations===

Black operations are the missions that require direct action (DA). They are the opposite of green operations missions, where the Force Recon operators &quot;look for trouble.&quot;

Examples are the seizures and occupation of gas/oil platforms (GOPLAT) and the visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) of ships during Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO).

They provide personal security detail (PSD) for critically important personnel within the MAGTF. They were formerly capable of performing In-Extremis Hostage Rescue (IHR), but this is no longer a Force Recon mission task.

==Organization==
In the past, early Force Reconnaissance companies initially were designed to function under the echelon of the Navy/Marine force commanders (e.g. under the direct operational control of the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) and Landing Force (CLF), and Fleet Marine Force) during amphibious landing operations or expeditionary engagements—to provide timely intelligence without exhausting their reconnaissance assets from the Marine Division without hampering their valuable support to its infantry regiments.

Due to these changes, FORECON has been detached and reported to multiple commanders of Marine divisions, the Command Elements (CE) of the Marine Air-Ground Task Forces, and the immediate commander of the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF). They were re-organized or reserved for &#x27;special reconnaissance&#x27; assignments that would otherwise help shape the outcome of his battlefield. These companies, for a few times in their existence, had either folded into the Marine Division, its Regiment&#x27;s Recon Battalions, or dissolved entirely to only resurface during conflicts, or when other similar reasons had arisen.

The creation of Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) on February 24, 2006, marked the United States Marine Corps&#x27; first commitment to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). On August 11 2006, 2nd FORECON was deactivated with the majority of its personnel transferred to MARSOC to establish 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion (2nd MSOB) with two platoons reassigned to 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion to establish D Company. Two months later in October, 1st FORECON met the same fate, with the majority of its personnel transferred to establish 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion (1st MSOB) with two platoons reassigned to 1st Reconnaissance Battalion to establish D Company. The D companies in the Division Reconnaissance Battalions were designed to maintain and preserve a &#x27;deep reconnaissance&#x27; asset for the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF). In 2007, 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion deactivated its D Company.

In 2008, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, directed that Force Reconnaissance Companies be re-established from Division Reconnaissance Battalion personnel to support the three MEFs: I MEF, II MEF and III MEF. The companies were placed under the operational command of the MEF and under the administrative control of the Division Reconnaissance Battalion. In December 2008, 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion activated its Force Reconnaissance Company. 

The three Force Reconnaissance companies of I, II, and III MEF are currently the only active components of force-&quot;level&quot; reconnaissance; whereas the 3rd FORECON is the Selected Reserve force reconnaissance asset available to augment and reinforce the Fleet Marine Force. In the Marine Corps Reserve, the FORECON is a separate unit reporting directly to the 4th Marine Division Commanding General (4th MarDiv CG), unless mobilized and ordered detached to a Gaining Force Commander. Additionally, as a separate unit, the FORECON are not part of 4th Reconnaissance Battalion, which is itself a separate unit reporting directly to the 4th MarDiv CG.

A force recon detachment had, since the mid-1980s, formed part of the Maritime Special Purpose Force (MSPF), a specialized sub-unit of a Marine expeditionary unit (special operations capable) (MEU(SOC)). From 2013 to 2023, MEU(SOC) were defunct, including the integral MSPF. A MEU had a Maritime Raid Force (MRF), the successor of the MSPF built around a FORECON detachment. In July 2023, II Marine Expeditionary Force certified the first MEU(SOC) in over decade, including an MSPF.

In February 2021, 4th Force Reconnaissance Company was deactivated and consolidated into the 4th Reconnaissance Battalion.

===Table of organization (T/O)===
Each Force Reconnaissance company is basically the same; they all contain a command element and Force Recon platoons. Each company is commanded by a company commander and his executive officer.

==History==

The historical roots of &#x27;Force Recon&#x27; companies can be traced back to the antecedent Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, whose numerous pre-D–Day reconnoitering of enemy beaches during the Pacific campaigns of World War II proved the vitality of the Fleet Marine Force&#x27;s amphibious reconnaissance doctrine. This unique unit reported directly to the landing force commander, providing him important intelligence at his disposal.

Formed initially as a company-size element from the Observer Group, under the command of Major James L. Jones, they were among the first—along with the early Navy Combat Demolition Units (the predecessor to the Underwater Demolition Teams [i.e., the Navy SEALs])—to embark from submarines; most of their missions complemented those of the NCDU and the UDT. The &#x27;amphibious reconnaissance&#x27; doctrine clearly outlined that the recon Marines&#x27; duties consisted of scouting the littoral areas, or beachhead, and inland; to test the soil permeability for a possible beach landing; to clear any obstacles that may hinder an amphibious assault; and to observe any sign of enemy activity. The Navy UDT were tasked with providing the same, but from off the coastline to the littoral, or adjacent beach areas.

Jones and his Recon Marines scouted the Japanese-fortified beaches and observed the terrain, materials, or other entities, primarily reporting to the force commander any vital intelligence of mission-oriented importance. Although Jones&#x27;s Marines were all skilled surface swimmers, they usually inserted by boats—mostly due to the multiple radios (primary and contingent) they carried, as relaying communication to the landing force commander was paramount, and as a timely means of sending in a platoon-sized element with heavy firepower (mortars, machine guns, etc.) at their disposal since they were greatly outnumbered and isolated from other major Marine forces, which were still embarked on the destroyer-transport ships.

By the end of World War II, the Amphib Recon Battalion disbanded its command; its Marines either filled the ranks of other infantry platoons, or integrated into the Scout (Tank) companies, and the newly formed division reconnaissance companies. This force-level reconnaissance element was not re-established until the early 1950s, when the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalions were assembled for preliminary operations in Korea. Their efforts proved that gaining the knowledge of the enemy before a major operation was crucial to safeguarding the men, and provided better operational planning.

The Korean War introduced the new concept of using rotary-wing aircraft to the Marine Corps in combat employment for logistics and rapid troop transport. Also, the atomic age was emerging and caused concern among the military leaders. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Lemuel Shepherd created a test unit, the Marine Corps Test Unit 1 (MCTU #1), to research and experiment on new and improved combat tactics and on methods to prepare the Marine Corps to operate strategically, in concert with or against, the use of nuclear weapons.

Many of the conceptual ideas for Force Recon were pioneered by Major Bruce F. Meyers, the test unit&#x27;s &quot;Reconnaissance/Pathfinder Project Officer&quot; from MCTU #1&#x27;s Plans and Development (P&amp;D) Section. His position can be seen as an unillustrated subsidiary to an &#x27;operations&#x27; (G-6) and &#x27;training&#x27; (G-7) officer. Major Meyers tested various innovative techniques for the &#x27;Recon Platoon&#x27; and evaluated their results for use in parachuting and pathfinding missions, in addition to using its heliborne and aircraft wing assets to add &#x27;deeper&#x27; reconnaissance penetration capabilities. This new-found capability gave reconnaissance Marines the advantage of operating further behind enemy lines.

The MCTU#1&#x27;s Reconnaissance Platoon, commanded by Captain Joseph Taylor, founded and adopted the more modern &#x27;force reconnaissance&#x27; doctrine, methods which were instrumented by Major Meyers. They were developing and performing innovative clandestine insertion methods before the Navy SEALs, and the Army&#x27;s &quot;Green Berets&quot;, such as the submarine locking -in and -out methods, and underwater &quot;blow-and-go&quot; ascents.

The USMC concluded that parachute reconnaissance and pathfinding capabilities would exist at force level, the Fleet Marine Force (the highest command echelon of the United States Marine Corps). At first, the concept was to be formed into a &quot;Force Recon Battalion&quot;—this battalion would have as many &#x27;force recon&#x27; companies as there were division-wing MAGTF&#x27;s in the Marine operating forces. Recognizing the limited budget during the fiscal year of 1957, it was instead recommended that it be formed at company-sized elements for the West and East Coast. In July 1957, The MCTU #1 was amalgamated into the existing 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion. The next day, the battalion cased its colors and re-designated it as 1st Force Reconnaissance Company. Although the test unit was no longer operating, Meyers continued to research and test more innovative methods.

Major Meyers and his top swimmers and senior officers of the company would test and train in submarine lock-in and lock-out methods and ascending techniques. After being cross-trained by the Navy&#x27;s Master Divers, they learned the operation of the early rebreather systems and advanced open water swimming. Meyers understood that his recon Marines would be operating 50 to 150 miles away from their littoral or operating area, or from any naval support. In order to get his Marines out of a &quot;hot&quot; area, extraction techniques needed to be developed. Bruce Meyer&#x27;s 1st FORECON, along with 1st Recon Company and 1st Marine Aircraft Wing were aware of the McGuire and STABO systems that were used by the United States Army&#x27;s Special Forces, though they agreed that they had defects and disadvantages. Instead, the Marine Corps created a system that was a more simplified rig that had greater capacity, the Special Personnel Insertion and Extraction (SPIE) rig.

The CIA&#x27;s highly secretive Special Activities Division (SAD), and more specifically its elite Special Operations Group (SOG), recruit operators from Marine Force Recon. In addition, joint Force Recon and CIA operations go back to the famed Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG) during the Vietnam War and still exist to this day.

===Weapons Planning Group (Code 121)===
The Reconnaissance/Surveillance Section of the Weapons Planning Group, Landing Force Development Center at Quantico introduced Force Recon to new technological methods of achieving their objective. Many of its tests and evaluations resembled the tests of MCTU #1. However, MCTU #1 were testing methods of inserting reconnaissance teams &quot;deep&quot; into the battlefield. The Weapons Planning Group (Code 121) provided the equipment that would become instrumental to recon Marines. Beacons for helicopter guidance, laser designators for the guidance of ordnance, laser rangefinders, and many more were tested.

During the Vietnam War, one of the reconnaissance officers of Code 121, then-Major Alex Lee, brought most of his testing experience to 3rd Force Reconnaissance Company when he was assigned as the commanding officer from 1969 to 1970. He formed Force Recon&#x27;s missions that are still distinct today: remote sensor operations. The Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center (SRC), predecessor to the Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Intelligence Group (SRIG), was formed within the III Marine Amphibious Force (IIId MAF). The obsolete pathfinding operations were taken over by the newer beacons and homing devices.

==Operations==

===Vietnam War, 1965–1974===

3rd Force Reconnaissance Company was activated, trained, fought, and deactivated during the Vietnam War. Activated in September 1965 as one of the first group of add-on units to meet demands of operations in Vietnam, the company formed at Camp Lejeune, N.C. and satellite on Second Force Reconnaissance Company that was under strength due to the demands for trained Force Recon Marines assigned to First Force in country. Facilities, cadre and equipment for training were provided by Second Force.

Volunteers were solicited from throughout the Marine Corps and the first four months were devoted to bringing the company up to strength in personnel. Beginning in January 1966 all operational personnel departed Camp Lejeune to train in the Caribbean and Panama. Returning to North Carolina in March, final preparations were carried out to meet the projected deployment date in May 1966. The expected deployment of the entire company did not occur, but a two platoon detachment embarked on the USS Boxer, transited through the Suez Canal, and arrived in country in time to be introduced to combat in Operation Hastings as part of The Special Landing Force in early July 1966.

The company (-) dropped to a not combat ready readiness status. Headquarters Marine Corps transferred several Officers and numerous Staff Non Commissioned Officers immediately after the detachment departed. In mid-June the company (-) was alerted to deploy immediately. Due to the reduced personnel readiness status, HQMC changed the deployment plan and ordered that a platoon be assigned to deploy with First Battalion, 26th Marines that had been activated at Camp Pendleton. The remainder of the company was ordered to move to Camp Pendleton to refit.

At the conclusion of Hastings the detachment was attached to Third Reconnaissance Battalion that had just arrived in Phu Bai from DaNang, having been replaced by the First Reconnaissance Battalion that had just begun arriving with the First Marine Division. Shortly, they were joined by the platoon that had come in country with 1/26.

They patrolled in Thua Thien Province until early January, 1967, when a task organized Special Purpose group carried out a prisoner rescue attempt. The remainder were sent to Khe Sanh where they developed the intelligence of a large enemy buildup, that was the prelude to The Hill Fights that occurred in April 1967.

Reunited, what was left of the three platoons, returned to Phu Bai to await the arrival of the company(-). Having been brought up to strength and operational readiness, the company was reunited on April 27, 1967, just in time for the NVA offensive to seize Quang Tri Province. The logistics element arrive at the &quot;Ramp&quot; at Dong Ha just in time for the opening salvos of the NVA artillery attacks that would continue daily until late autumn.

The operational element experienced a mortar attack in Phu Bai at the same time resulting in several shrapnel wounds, only one of which, required evacuation. The new arrivals were integrated with combat veterans and the entire eighteen teams conducted a zone reconnaissance in the Cobi Than Tan Valley east of Hue City before displacing to Dong Ha.

Upon arrival at Dong Ha in early May the Commanding Officer assumed command of Third Recon Battalion (Forward), which had reconnaissance responsibility for all of Quang Tri Province except the Khe Sanh TAOR (Tactical Area of Operations). The company patrolled the area north of Highway nine to the DMZ, while the Battalion Company was targeted south of Highway Nine to the Thua Thien border. Occasional circumstances caused deviation from that concept, but, for the most part, those deviations were rare. Third Force continued that operational commitment until the Third Division left country in November 1969.

Third Force was placed under command of The Third Marine Expeditionary Force and operated in general support of IIId MAF until deactivated in mid-1970.

===Recent===
On 9 September 2010, the Force Reconnaissance platoon assigned to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (special operations capable) (MEU(SOC)) on the USS &quot;Dubuque&quot; (LPD-8) conducting the USMC&#x27;s first opposed Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) recapturing the MV Magellan Star from Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden.

In 2010, a Force Reconnaissance team from the 24th MEU won the 2010 2nd Annual Warrior Competition against tactical units from all over the world.

==Mission training plan==

Training within the company is outlined by the mission training plan (MTP). It is used in conjunction with the training and exercises that are conducted by the Marine Expeditionary Units for their &quot;Special Operations Capable&quot; certification. It follows a systematic approach to training, and the emphasis is to &quot;train as they expect to fight&quot;.

:&quot;The best form of WELFARE for our Marines and sailors is first class training; this saves unnecessary casualties&quot;. —MTP quote by S-3 of FORECON companies.

The mission training plan has five phases, and is based on a two-year platoon cycle. Training is ongoing and continuous, and functions as if it were a loop. Before FORECON operators are &quot;Special Operations Capable&quot; they follow the company&#x27;s MTP, which underlines the training protocol of the Pre-deployment Training Program (PTP).

# Phase 1: Individual training
# Phase 2: Unit training
# Phase 3: MEU (SOC) training
# Phase 4: MEU (SOC) deployment
# Phase 5: MEU (SOC) post deployment

===Phase 1===
The Marine candidates who had passed the initial yet vigorous indoctrination exam must undergo and complete a series of courses required for the designated MOS 0326 [formerly &quot;8654&quot;], &quot;Reconnaissance Marine, Parachutist/Combatant Diver Qualified,&quot; known as the &#x27;accession pipeline.&#x27;

Their courses to its various schools are intertwined with the Pre-deployment Training Program (PTP), a training protocol of the Fleet Marine Force–its task forces–that are conducted yearly in a perpetual, continuous cycle. The reconnaissance Marines within FORECON community are unique in that it is the volition of the individual Marine to remain another two-year detachment to the Force Reconnaissance Company. Those that had chosen to remain in the company will proceed to the advanced course of instructions, and again during the next FMF rotational training cycle, and forth. This is due in respects to their status of having already completed and qualified in the appropriate course required for MOS 0321; which otherwise, the initial training, e.g. the accession pipeline, are reserved for the candidates.

The first phase in FORECON&#x27;s Mission Training Plan takes place within the MEU&#x27;s Initial Training Phase.

====Accession pipeline====
* Infantry Rifleman Course – Infantry Training Battalion, US Marine Corps Schools of Infantry (East or West)
*Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) – United States Marine Corps School of Infantry (West)
*Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) [Level &quot;C&quot;]/Navy Remote Training Sites; NAS North Island, Warner Springs, California.
*United States Marine Corps Combatant Diver Course – Navy Diving Salvage and Training Center, Naval Support Activity Panama City, Florida
*Basic Airborne Course – United States Army Airborne School, Fort Benning, Georgia
*Multi Mission Parachute Course – CPS Complete Parachute Systems, Coolidge, Arizona
*High Risk Personnel (HRP) Course – MCB Quantico, Virginia
*Special Operations Training Group (SOTG) – I MEF, Camp Pendleton; II MEF, Camp Lejeune; III MEF, Camp S.D. Butler

====Special schools====
During the &quot;Individual Training Phase&quot;, the candidates are undergoing the accession pipeline to become qualified MOS 0321 (Reconnaissance Marine). After further training, the already-billeted Force Recon operators (who had already completed the required courses in the accession pipeline [BRC, parachutist and diving, and SERE/HRP courses]) attain MOS 0326 (Reconnaissance Marine, parachute and combatant diver qualified) and may continue to remain with FORECON after the three-year rotation cycle. They may be selected for additional advanced cross-service training from other schools provided by the Special Operations Forces (SOF) units. Although these specialized schools are not necessarily required, they are highly encouraged.

Many Marine Corps &#x27;training liaisons&#x27; represent the Marines at many cross-services schools, to ensure training slots and openings are met and filled by the Marines that requested, or were recommended, for advanced training. Some of these courses may not be able to facilitate the Marine students; the instructors of these schools resort to complement the Marines&#x27; requested syllabus by designing similar subsidiary courses. This argument becomes clear on whether Marines may, or may not, actually attend the Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S). Nonetheless, in the past, selected operators within Force Recon had attended the courses of instructions provided by BUD/S Instructors and their completion is documented in their military Service Record Book (SRB) or Officer Qualification Record (OQR).

*Tactical Air Control Party – one per team
*U.S. Army Ranger School – all team leaders and above
*U.S. Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course – all team leaders and above
*U.S. Army Pathfinder School – all team leaders and above
*U.S. Army Jumpmaster School – minimum two per platoon
*Military Free-Fall Jumpmaster Course – minimum two per platoon
*Mountain Leaders (Summer/Winter) Course – one per team
* USMC Scout Sniper Course – minimum one per team
* Helicopter Rope Suspension Technique (HRST) Master Course – minimum two per platoon
* Dive Supervisor Course – minimum two per platoon
* LAR V Technician Course – two per platoon

===Phase 2===
The second phase of the MTP also takes place during the MEU&#x27;s PTP Initial Training Phase.

====Training cell====
The training cell (T-Cell) is regulated by the experienced staff non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) of FMF Recon company&#x27;s Operations Section (S-3). This removes the responsibility of coordinating training from the platoon headquarters, and permits them to train with their men (rather than to just oversee the training).

:&quot;Train like you fight and fight like you train!&quot;—quote by George S. Patton.

An additional and no less important advantage to the T-Cell is that it acts as a training ground for future platoon sergeants. Those assigned to the T-Cell are all highly trained and experienced operators. Some have deployed as platoon sergeants, and some have not. Experienced FORECON operators within T-Cell monitor, evaluate and improve the training to ensure that exercises meet real-world conditions.
* Advanced Long Range Communications Package (3 weeks) – It is conducted by the Company Communications Section. As the term deep reconnaissance indicates, the platoon will operate well forward of other forces. In order to report observations, calls for fire or extract, all members need to have a complete and thorough knowledge of the sophisticated communication equipment carried. It includes manual Morse code, and long-range high frequency (HF), satellite, multi-band, and digital communications.
* Weapons and Tactics Package (3 weeks) – Involves 5,000–8,000 rounds fired from the M4 carbine equipped with a Special Operations Peculiar Modification kit and the MEU(SOC) Pistol (.45 ACP). A live fire and maneuvering exercise in immediate action (IA) drills within close range of rotary wing support, as well as transportation, is conducted on the third week. As the Marines become familiar with their weapons, they conduct field exercise, force-on-force, live-fire drills using a militarized version of the Simunitions kit called the Special Effects Small Arms Marking Systems, or SESAMS. The Marking Cartridge ammunition contains a sabot and a small, plastic round encasing a colored detergent or paint, usually red or blue.
* Threat Weapons Familiarization Package (1 week) – Concludes &quot;knowledge of weapons&quot; with identification and operation of threat weapons used by adversaries of the United States. Threat Weapons include assault, automatic and mobilized weapons.
* Force Fires Package – Gives the Marines a working knowledge of fixed and rotary wing close air support and Naval Gun Surface Fire (NGSF) by using the AN/PEQ-1 SOFLAM to &quot;paint&quot; their targets.

* Mobile Reconnaissance Package – Covers operating and maintaining the M998 HMMWV and the Interim Fast Attack Vehicle. Rapid deployment of FORECON requires fast mobilization. The current IFAV is a replacement of the two earlier FAVs, the M-151A2 and the Chenowth FAV that were employed in the 1980s and 1990s.
* Advanced Airborne Package – Extremely important to Force Recon for inserting Marines behind enemy lines. In this three-week period, Marines has started the transition from conventional Low Level Static Line (LLSL) insertions into the hallmark HALO techniques. Usually it consists of consecutive night jumps with night combat equipment, but HALO training is done in the Paraloft of the S3 Section using a complex virtual reality-based (VR) computer system. While wearing a VR headset device, the Marines hang suspended from the Paraloft ceiling that resembles the MC-5 Ram Air parachute. Many simulations are factored in this Virtual Reality Parachute Simulation; it allows the Marine to jump at high altitudes and visually check his main canopy for proper deployment, alleviate malfunctions, to cutaway and deploy a reserve parachute, then employ guidance and control to an unmarked drop zone (DZ).
* Combat Trauma Package – Examination of first aid and medical treatment that can prepare Marines in many realistic scenarios where Marines can become casualties. This package is built for Marines to give them confidence and knowledge to apply medical attention to themselves or others while operating in hazard environments whether they are engaged in combat or not.
* Amphibious Training Package (2 weeks) – While Marines were introduced to amphibious reconnaissance from the BRC, the T-Cell outlines the Amphibious Training package before they are attached to a MEU(SOC), this package refines their ability to conduct amphibious operations, and conventional and selected maritime special operations capabilities incorporating all their skills for Marines to work as a team. Refreshes long-range nautical navigation, and refines the platoon SOP for conducting hydrographic surveys. Launch and recovery is from a variety of naval vessels, including surface combatants and submarines. This training takes place at Seal Beach and San Diego, California on the West Coast; and Onslow Beach, North Carolina on the east coast.
* Combatant Dive Package – Designed for concentrating on the unit&#x27;s capabilities in the water. They will learn more about the LAR-V rebreather as they have been taught at the USMC Combatant Dive Course. The T-Cell will introduce the Diver Propulsion Device (DPD) and the &quot;buddy line&quot;, a pipe made from composite plastics that every Marine is attached to when diving. This ensures that the team remain close together as the water may be impossible for visuals contact in subsurface swimming.

Other training packages are available to mold the Marines into a fully functional Recon unit, including long range patrolling in desert areas, such as Twentynine Palms or MCAS Yuma, mountainous terrain and other environments relevant in peacetime or conflict. At the end of Phase 2 Training, the platoon is completely stood up in all aspects of the &quot;long-range&quot; reconnaissance mission. More importantly, they have spent 6 months of &#x27;platoon-oriented&#x27; training together.

===Phase 3===

====Special Operations Training Group (SOTG)====

This six-month training phase emphasizing more in the direct action, or &quot;black operations&quot;. It is conducted by the Special Operations Training Group (SOTG). This phase takes place during the MEU&#x27;s PTP Intermediate Training Phase. These courses involves both aspects of maritime and urbanized environments and how to apply close quarters combat and science in demolition, gas/oil platform (GOPLAT) training, cordon and search, Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS), shipboard assaults training and humanitarian operations. The recon operators get the chance to train in unfamiliar urban areas and maritime structures.

===Phase 4===

Once the SOC Certification Final Training Phase is finished, the MEU with the detached Force Recon platoon as a functional special operations &quot;capable&quot; force. Then they sail on a six-month deployment. This long deployment is known as the &#x27;Deployment Phases&#x27; to Force Recon, they sail from either three locations, off the East or West Coast, or Okinawa. The I MEF on the West would deploy its Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) to the western Pacific and the II MEF&#x27;s MEUs on the East Coast sails across the Atlantic Ocean to either the Mediterranean Sea or the Persian Gulf. The III MEF&#x27;s 31st MEU in Okinawa is to be used as a contingency for reinforced support of an area spanning from southwest Asia to the central Pacific. The III MEF is the only MEF of the FMF that is permanently fully deployed at all times.

While Force Recon is afloat, they still remain focused on their self-disciplined training sessions. They conduct small arms live fire training on the deck of the ships and physical fitness training. In many cases, foreign maritime forces alike participate in joint exercises or training maneuvers, such as the Royal Thai Marine Corps, British Royal Marines, and Australian Forces. But while they may be training, the MEU are capable of projecting fully forward deployed operational task forces. Thus, epitomizing the infamous Marine Corps slogan, &quot;&quot;force-in-readiness&quot;.&quot;

===Phase 5===
The last phase is the post-deployment phase. After 18 months of training and deployment, the platoon is granted 30 days of military leave. Once a Force Recon operator has finished deployment, they have a decision to make. What makes Force Recon unique from Division Recon, and the other SOFs, is the career style that is being placed in the Force Recon company structure. They can choose to stay with the Force Recon Company and continue their assignment with the MEU, recycling its loop cycle; or they can get release from the FORECON company and go back to their original assignment, whether administration, motor transport, or infantry. However, on average, approximately 50% of the platoon will leave, their time in Force having expired.

==Equipment==

The primary weapons used by both Division and FMF Recon assets are typically the same standard-issued weapons in the arsenal of the Marine Corps. However, since Force Recon&#x27;s missions are directly involved in parachuting and underwater insertions, they demand weapons and equipment that are essential to their job. Their equipment reflects on which ever tasks that have been assigned by the MAGTF, MEF, or MEU commander; either direct action (black) or deep recon (green) operations.

===Table of equipment (T/E)===
Some equipment only fits the needs for one particular mission over another. There is however some equipment that is used for both black and green operations, and these pieces of gear are usually combat vests, flak and armor jackets (or systems), and harnesses for use in hasty extraction measures.

Particularly during green operations, these missions normally encompass surveillance and reconnaissance. The equipment items carried into the field are usually cameras, scopes, and most importantly communications. Two recon Marines serve as radiomen in the team. Each team/platoon often brings two field radios that are able to withstand the elements of seawater, and rugged patrolling as they tread inland—if one radio fails, they resort to the supplemental radio. This is to ensure that vital information can always be sent to the commander, and to the S-3/S-6 shop, or similar intelligence collection agencies. More common in today&#x27;s infrastructure, much of the intelligence-gathered information is sent to and processed by the Marine Expeditionary Force&#x27;s &quot;Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Intelligence Group&quot; (SRIG).

For black operations, the Marines carry weapons that are more of the close-quarter combative use; grenades, carbine rifles, sub-machine guns (SMGs), and any tool to use for breaching barricades and doors. They can be equipped with laser designating devices to &quot;paint&quot; their targets with laser-guiding coordinates to deliver payload to un-expecting targets. Since they are &quot;bringing the fight to the enemy&quot;, they do not rely on camouflage as stealthy action is not a factor in these situations.


===Special equipment===

Throughout training and real life operations, jet fins, snorkels and low-volume double lens dive masks are used. In addition to the SCUBA equipment used in amphibious mission-essential tasks, Force Recon maintains and operates parachutes. This is the main difference and separation from Division Reconnaissance—all FORECON operators are required to be parachutists. The parachutist equipment is stored in the Force Reconnaissance&#x27;s Parachute Loft.

==== Parachute pack systems ====
The parachute is one of the trademarks of Force Recon, throughout its existence the operators have extensively used a wide variety of parachutes. In the mid-1950s, they used the T-10, then later adopting the Capewell canopy release which provided a cut-away to reduce the deadly effect of drag. The T-10 became the most frequented parachute; which had two variants, one for low-level static line (LLSL) and the other for military free fall (MFF) descends. They had numerous parachutes listed under the Table of Equipment (T/E) that had been contained in the Paraloft. Even in its formative days in the Marine Corps Test Unit#1, the operators and testers of the Naval Parachute Unit (NPU) at El Centro had tested and sported numerous parachutes, adding modifications and suggestions that soon were adopted by other parachutists. By the 1990s, the MC-4 and MC-5 ram air parachutes became the feasible choice, as it allows more detailed and accurate landing in smaller areas, easy to control—especially during oscillation of the canopy. Plus, it was formed to modulate between the LLSL and MFF without having to consort to a different pack.

These are parachutes that are still contained in the T/E of the Parachute Loft, however some may not be currently in use:
* T-10
* MC1-B
* MC-series ram air parachutes (MC-4, MC-5)
** Canopies (Main &amp; Reserve): Surface area 
** Altitude range: AG&gt; to ft MSL
** Forward speed: 15–25 mph
** Rate of descent: 4–18 ft/sec
** Maximum Load: 
* Multi-Mission Parachute System (MMPS) [currently being implemented—replacing the older MC-5]

==== Parachutist individual equipment kit ====
The parachutist individual equipment kit (PIEK) contains all the Force Recon&#x27;s parachutist clothing and equipment assigned by Force Recon&#x27;s Paraloft. They are used for the high-altitude MFFs (HAHO or HALO) and LLSL parachute operations. Due to extreme cold encountered during high altitude parachute operations, the parachutist must have protection from the environment.

* Gore-Tex jumpsuit
* Polartec jumpsuit liner
* Cotton ripstop jumpsuit
* Flyer&#x27;s gloves
* Gore-Tex cold-weather gloves
* Overboots
* MA2-30 altimeter
* Helmet
* Flyer&#x27;s helmet bag
* Flyer&#x27;s kitbag—used to carry operator&#x27;s rucksack, ammunition, communications, etc.

==== Single-action release personal equipment lowering equipment (SARPELS) ====
The Force Recon operators are equipped with a complete equipment lowering system for both LLSL and MFF parachute operations. It allows them carry various configurations of all their individual mission-essential equipment, usually contained within their flyer&#x27;s kitbag. The single-action release personal equipment lowering equipment (SARPELS) provides easy access to their weapons and equipment upon parachute landing and has a single-action release capability. It can be front or rear mounted, whichever is preferred. Once they have descended to about above the surface, they use the SARPEL to release their gear (weapons/kitbag), dropping it below them while still attached to their harness by a rope. It is used to minimize injuries in landing due to heavy load of equipment. The parachutists must maneuver themselves in order not to drop onto their gear during parachute landing falls.

* SARPELS cargo carrier
* Horizontal &amp; vertical cargo carrier securing straps
* Single-action release handle
* MFF eEquipment attaching strap
* LLSL lowering line
* MFF lowering line

==Annual Warrior Competition==
The 24th MEU 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company won the 2010 Annual Warrior Competition against tactical units from all over the world.

==Creed==
Realizing it is my choice and my choice alone to be a Reconnaissance Marine, I accept all challenges involved with this profession. Forever shall I strive to maintain the tremendous reputation of those who went before me.

Exceeding beyond the limitations set down by others shall be my goal. Sacrificing personal comforts and dedicating myself to the completion of the reconnaissance mission shall be my life. Physical fitness, mental attitude, and high ethics—The title of Recon Marine is my honor.

Conquering all obstacles, both large and small, I shall never quit. To quit, to surrender, to give up is to fail. To be a Recon Marine is to surpass failure; To overcome, to adapt and to do whatever it takes to complete the mission.

On the battlefield, as in all areas of life, I shall stand tall above the competition. Through professional pride, integrity, and teamwork, I shall be the example for all Marines to emulate.

Never shall I forget the principles I accepted to become a Recon Marine. Honor, Perseverance, Spirit and Heart. A Recon Marine can speak without saying a word and achieve what others can only imagine.

<text>Michael Andrew &quot;Duff&quot; McKagan (born February 5, 1964) is an American musician. He has been the bassist of hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses for twelve years, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. McKagan rejoined the band in 2016, following their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Toward the end of his first tenure with Guns N&#x27; Roses, McKagan released the solo album &quot;Believe in Me&quot; (1993) and formed the short-lived supergroup Neurotic Outsiders. Following his departure from Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1997, McKagan briefly reunited with his pre-success Seattle punk band 10 Minute Warning, before forming the still-active hard rock band Loaded, in which he performs lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Between 2002 and 2008, he played bass in the supergroup Velvet Revolver with his former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates Slash and Matt Sorum. He briefly performed with Alice in Chains in 2006, with Jane&#x27;s Addiction in 2010, and with the supergroup Hollywood Vampires in 2016. He has also collaborated in several short-lived projects with fellow Seattle-native musicians Mike McCready (primarily of Pearl Jam) and Barrett Martin (formerly of Screaming Trees), including Walking Papers and Levee Walkers.

In addition to his musical career, McKagan has established himself as a writer. He has written weekly columns on a wide variety of topics for SeattleWeekly.com, Playboy.com, and ESPN.com. Previously a high school drop-out, he attended Seattle University&#x27;s Albers School of Business and Economics in the early 2000s, and subsequently founded the wealth management firm Meridian Rock.

==Early life==
Michael Andrew McKagan was born February 5, 1964, and grew up in Seattle&#x27;s largely working-class University District, the youngest of eight children born to Marie and Elmer &quot;Mac&quot; McKagan. He has been called &quot;Duff&quot; since toddlerhood, to which he once referred as &quot;an Irish thing&quot;. Following his parents&#x27; divorce, his mother supported the family by taking a job as a medical stenographer. His brother Bruce taught him how to play bass and he further developed his skills by playing along with the albums &quot;1999&quot; by Prince and &quot;Damaged&quot; by Black Flag. In his autobiography &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy (And Other Lies)&quot;, McKagan wrote that he fashioned himself after punk bassists such as Barry Adamson of Magazine and Paul Simonon of the Clash, and also Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead.

Although an honors student, McKagan dropped out of Roosevelt High School in the tenth grade. He then worked as a pastry chef for the Great American Food and Beverage Company while earning his GED. He was later awarded an honorary diploma after speaking at the class of 2012&#x27;s graduation ceremony.

==Career==

===1979–1985: early years===
In 1979, at the age of 15, McKagan formed the punk band The Vains, in which he played bass. During this time he performed under the stage name Nico Teen. The band released one single, &quot;School Jerks&quot;, in 1980.

In 1980, McKagan joined the pop-punk band The Fastbacks as their drummer. He first performed with the band in December 1980, and appeared on their 1981 debut single &quot;It&#x27;s Your Birthday&quot;, which was issued on guitarist Kurt Bloch&#x27;s label No Threes Records. He was later on the song &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Room&quot;, which was included on the &quot;Seattle Syndrome: Volume One&quot; compilation album, also released in 1981. His last performance was in July 1981.

Around this time he also played lead guitar in the punk band The Living, which opened shows for Hüsker Dü and D.O.A., which developed a devoted following. In 1982 they recorded an EP, which remained unreleased until April 2021, under the title &quot;1982&quot;.

In 1982, McKagan became the drummer for the hardcore punk band The Fartz, with whom he recorded several demos, five of which were included on their 1990 album &quot;You, We See You Crawling&quot;. After several line-up changes, The Fartz evolved into the post-punk band 10 Minute Warning, for which McKagan played guitar.

In Autumn 1984, McKagan moved to Los Angeles, California, with one of his brothers where he found work as an appetizer server at a Black Angus restaurant in Northridge, Los Angeles. Answering an ad for a bass guitarist in a local newspaper, he met guitarist Slash and drummer Steven Adler, with whom he formed the short-lived band Road Crew. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes, and worked on material that included the main riff of what would become the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;. Slash eventually disbanded the group due to them not being able to find a singer, as well as Adler&#x27;s lack of work ethic compared to himself and McKagan.

===1985–1997: Guns N&#x27; Roses, &quot;Believe in Me&quot; and Neurotic Outsiders===
In March 1985, McKagan replaced bassist Ole Beich in Guns N&#x27; Roses, which was newly founded by singer Axl Rose, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin of Hollywood Rose, lead guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Rob Gardner of L.A. Guns. McKagan&#x27;s Road Crew bandmates Slash and Steven Adler joined the band two months later, after Guns and Gardner quit respectively. After two days of rehearsal, the line-up played its debut gig at The Troubadour on June 6. In 1987, Guns N&#x27; Roses released its debut album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, which to date has sold over 28 million copies worldwide, 18 million of which were in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S. The following year, the band released &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot;, which sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone, despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot;.

In May 1991, Guns N&#x27; Roses embarked on the two-and-a-half-year-long Use Your Illusion Tour. The following September, the band released the long-awaited albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 respectively on the U.S. chart, a feat unachieved by any other group. In 1993, the band released &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;, a cover album of mostly punk songs, which proved less successful than its predecessors. McKagan took on lead vocals on four songs, including live favorite &quot;Attitude&quot;, originally by the Misfits. That same year, McKagan released his debut solo album &quot;Believe in Me&quot;, on which he sang lead vocals and played virtually every instrument.

On April 4, 1993 while touring with Guns N&#x27; Roses, McKagan was hit in the head with a beer bottle filled with urine thrown by a fan. He was sent to the hospital minutes later. Axl Rose said this to the crowd after McKagan was hit:

 &quot;I hate to ruin your fun, and our fun, but somebody just hit Duff in the head with a bottle, and now he&#x27;s not able to play.&quot; &quot;So we&#x27;re sorry, have a good night. And if you find the asshole, kill him.&quot;
Rose threw the mic over his shoulder and walked off the stage.

In 1995, with Guns N&#x27; Roses largely inactive, McKagan formed the supergroup Neurotic Outsiders with Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, John Taylor of Duran Duran, and his Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Matt Sorum. Originally a gathering of friends jamming together at the Viper Room in Hollywood, they released their self-titled album on Maverick Records in 1996. The band played a brief tour of Europe and North America, before disbanding in 1997. McKagan was the last member of the &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; lineup to leave Guns N&#x27; Roses, resigning as bassist in August 1997. McKagan had recently become a father and wrote about his decision to leave in his autobiography, stating &quot;Guns had been paying rent on studios for three years now—from 1994 to 1997—and still did not have a single song. The whole operation was so erratic that it didn&#x27;t seem to fit with my hopes for parenthood, for stability.&quot;

=== 1997–2002: 10 Minute Warning reunion, &quot;Beautiful Disease&quot; and Loaded===
Following his departure from Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1997, McKagan moved back to Seattle, where he met with many of his old friends, including Pearl Jam&#x27;s Stone Gossard, who convinced him to reunite 10 Minute Warning. Singer Christopher Blue was brought in to replace Steve Verwolf, who was serving a term in federal prison. In 1998, the band released their self-titled album on Sub Pop. The album featured nine tracks, including two new versions of songs originally recorded by The Fartz, namely &quot;Is This the Way?&quot; and &quot;Buried&quot;. 10 Minute Warning played its last show on August 22, 1998 at the Roseland theater in Portland, Oregon.

McKagan&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Beautiful Disease&quot;, was intended to be released in 1999, but became lost in the legal shuffle of the merge between Geffen Records and Interscope Records. McKagan was dropped from Geffen&#x27;s roster, and subsequently lost all commercial rights to release the record. For the tour supporting his ill-fated solo album, he formed the band Loaded, which consisted of McKagan on bass and vocals, Dez Cadena, formerly of Black Flag, on guitar, Michael Barragan, formerly of Plexi, on guitar, and Taz Bentley, formerly of The Reverend Horton Heat, on drums. Loaded independently released the live record &quot;Episode 1999: Live&quot;, before disbanding in late 1999.

In 2000, McKagan reformed Loaded, remaining as the lead vocalist but switching from bass to rhythm guitar, and adding drummer Geoff Reading of Green Apple Quick Step, guitarist Mike Squires of Harvey Danger, and bassist Jeff Rouse of Alien Crime Syndicate. Both Squires and Rouse joined after the recording of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Dark Days&quot;, released in 2001. Dave Dederer, formerly of The Presidents of the United States of America, took up recording duties for the album.

In 2002, while on tour, both Squires and Rouse left Loaded to join the reformed Alien Crime Syndicate. Former Wasted Youth and Electric Love Hogs guitarist Dave Kushner and former Burning Witch bassist George Stuart Dahlquist were brought in to replace them. McKagan and Kushner went on to form Velvet Revolver, putting Loaded on hiatus.

===2002–2010: Velvet Revolver, Alice in Chains, Loaded reunion, Jane&#x27;s Addiction===

In 2002, McKagan founded the supergroup Velvet Revolver with his former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates Slash and Matt Sorum, and Loaded guitarist Dave Kushner. Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland completed the line-up. In 2004, they released their debut album &quot;Contraband&quot;, which debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. chart and sold two million copies. In 2005, the band was nominated for three Grammys, Rock Album of the Year, Rock Song, and Hard Rock Performance for their Contraband single Slither which won their first and only Grammy. Their second album, &quot;Libertad&quot;, was released in 2007 to mixed reviews; it failed to achieve the same commercial success as its predecessor. The band toured extensively, until Weiland left in April 2008 to reunite with Stone Temple Pilots. Velvet Revolver has been on hiatus since Weiland&#x27;s departure.

In 2006, McKagan temporarily joined Alice in Chains as a rhythm guitarist, performing with the band for the first time at VH1&#x27;s &quot;Decades Rock Live&quot; concert honoring Heart, and later during their reunion tour.

McKagan subsequently reunited Loaded, with Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse returning to the group, and the same year, they released the EP &quot;Wasted Heart&quot;. In 2009, the band released its second studio album, &quot;Sick&quot;, and embarked on tours with Mötley Crüe and Black Stone Cherry. Later that year, Geoff Reading departed the band; he was replaced by Isaac Carpenter.

In 2010, McKagan briefly joined Jane&#x27;s Addiction, with lead guitarist Dave Navarro originally confirming that McKagan had joined the band on a permanent basis. On joining the band, McKagan stated, &quot;Something like a chance to write, record, and perhaps even perform with a band of the quality of Jane&#x27;s Addiction does not come around every day. I have a lot of respect for this band and the guys in it.&quot; He worked on several songs with Jane&#x27;s Addiction and played four shows with the band—two in Los Angeles, and two in Europe, including one at Rock in Rio in Madrid.

On September 6, six months after McKagan joined the band, Jane&#x27;s Addiction announced that they had parted ways due to the fact that &quot;musically [they] were all headed in different directions.&quot;
===2010–present: Kings of Chaos, his book, Walking Papers, return to Guns N&#x27; Roses, &quot;Tenderness&quot; and Max Creeps===
On October 14, 2010, McKagan appeared on stage with Guns N&#x27; Roses for the first time since 1993 at The O2 Arena in London. He played bass on &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;, electric guitar on &quot;Nice Boys&quot; and &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, and acoustic guitar and tambourine on &quot;Patience&quot;. McKagan then returned to Loaded, with whom he recorded a third studio album, &quot;The Taking&quot;, which was released in 2011. Loaded twice served as opening act for Guns N&#x27; Roses in December of that year, with McKagan again briefly joining his old band on stage.

&quot;It&#x27;s So Easy *And Other Lies*&quot; is the title of McKagan&#x27;s book released in 2011 in which he tells his view and perspectives on stories encountered during his career.

On April 14, 2012, McKagan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the classic lineup of Guns N&#x27; Roses.

In 2012, McKagan went on tour with the Rock N Roll All Stars, a band that consisted of many of rock&#x27;s most recognized performers. The band downsized and became the Kings Of Chaos in 2013. The primary members with McKagan are Joe Elliott of Def Leppard and Joe Elliott&#x27;s Down N&#x27; Outz, Matt Sorum of Guns N&#x27; Roses and Velvet Revolver, Gilby Clarke of Guns N&#x27; Roses and Steve Stevens of Billy Idol&#x27;s band. Others who round out the group are: Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple fame and Sebastian Bach, formerly of Skid Row. The band released the cover song &quot;Never Before&quot; by Deep Purple.

Also in 2012 McKagan formed the band Walking Papers with former The Missionary Position members, played on the self-titled debut album and toured with them in 2013. In 2014, McKagan again briefly reunited with Guns N&#x27; Roses. He played five full shows in South America, filling in for Tommy Stinson. McKagan subsequently played with Guns N&#x27; Roses at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards show in Los Angeles. During Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; spring 2014 residency at The Joint in Las Vegas, McKagan played another full concert with the band.

In 2016, McKagan was announced (alongside Slash), as having returned to Guns N&#x27; Roses to headline Coachella. After playing a secret warmup gig at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on April 1, 2016, The band embarked on the Not in This Lifetime... Tour.

On December 5, 2018, it was announced that McKagan is currently in production for a new solo album to be released in 2019. On March 10, 2019, McKagan revealed that the album, &quot;Tenderness&quot;, would be released on May 31 and also released a track from the album titled &quot;Chip Away&quot;.

In April 2022 various famous artists, like Slash, Billie Joe Armstrong, Henry Rollins, and McKagan himself, publicly bemoaned the breakup of a mysterious legendary Seattle band called Max Creeps. In the following weeks, it turned out to be a guerilla marketing campaign for a new project, involving McKagan and Fastbacks singer Kurt Bloch, but so far this hasn&#x27;t been officially confirmed. Max Creeps released two singles, &quot;The Internet Killed Me&quot; and &quot;Hung, Drawn and Quartered&quot;. On May 13 Max Creeps released their &#x27;second&#x27; album &quot;Nein&quot; on Velocity Records, though no evidence exists that there ever was a first album.

===Session work===
In 1990, McKagan—along with his Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Slash—co-wrote and played several songs on Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Brick by Brick&quot;. In 1995, he collaborated with Slash on his solo project Slash&#x27;s Snakepit; he co-wrote &quot;Beggars and Hangers-On&quot; off their album &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot;, which he played live during a Snakepit show in May of that year. In 1998, McKagan collaborated with his former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Izzy Stradlin on his solo album &quot;117°&quot;. The following year, he played on Stradlin&#x27;s album &quot;Ride On&quot;, and joined him on a tour of Japan supporting the album. Also in 1999, he contributed to the album &quot;Humanary Stew: A Tribute to Alice Cooper&quot;, an Alice Cooper tribute album. In 2001, McKagan played on the album &quot;Skyjin&quot; by Zilch, Mark Lanegan&#x27;s solo album &quot;Field Songs&quot;, and Izzy Stradlin&#x27;s album &quot;River&quot;. The following year, he played on Stradlin&#x27;s album &quot;On Down the Road&quot;. In 2004, he again collaborated with Mark Lanegan on his album &quot;Bubblegum&quot;, along with Stradlin.

McKagan played on three tracks off Izzy Stradlin&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Concrete&quot;, including the title track, as well as seven songs off his album &quot;Wave of Heat&quot;, which was released in 2010. Also in 2010, McKagan appeared on Slash&#x27;s eponymous debut solo album; he played on the track &quot;Watch This&quot; with Dave Grohl on drums. That year, he also made a guest appearance—along with Slash and Matt Sorum—on Macy Gray&#x27;s album &quot;The Sellout&quot;, and appeared on the Manic Street Preachers song &quot;A Billion Balconies Facing the Sun&quot; off their album &quot;Postcards From a Young Man&quot;.

In 2020, McKagan played bass and cowrote five songs on Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s album &quot;Ordinary Man&quot;, along with Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith. McKagan&#x27;s Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Slash is featured on the song &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, which also features co-writer Andrew Watt of California Breed fame.

In 2021, McKagan played bass on Jerry Cantrell&#x27;s album &quot;Brighten&quot;.

In 2022, McKagan performed on and co-wrote three songs on Iggy Pop&#x27;s album &quot;Every Loser&quot;. To promote the album, McKagan will be part of Pop&#x27;s backing band named The Losers which consists of Chad Smith, Josh Klinghoffer and Andrew Watt.

=== Other ventures ===
McKagan has two minor acting credits; in 1988, he appeared with his Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film &quot;The Dead Pool&quot;, and in 1997, he played a rocker vampire in an episode of the television series &quot;Sliders&quot;. In 1999, he appeared in Anthony Scarpa&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Betty Blowtorch and Her Amazing True Life Adventures&quot;, which focuses on the all-female hard rock band Betty Blowtorch, whose debut EP &quot;Get Off&quot; McKagan produced the same year.

In addition to his musical career, McKagan has established himself as a writer. Since August 2008, he has written a weekly column for SeattleWeekly.com, from January to December 2009, he wrote a weekly financial column titled &quot;Duffonomics&quot; for Playboy.com, and since January 2011, he has written a weekly sports column for ESPN.com. McKagan&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy (And Other Lies)&quot;, was released on October 4, 2011. His second book, &quot;How to Be a Man: (and other illusions)&quot; was released on May 12, 2015. McKagan released a three-song EP with the same title to accompany the book, featuring Izzy Stradlin, Jerry Cantrell, Roy Mayorga and Taz Bentley.

In 2011, McKagan founded Meridian Rock, a wealth management firm for musicians. Headed by McKagan and British investor Andy Bottomley, the firm aims to educate musicians about their finances.

McKagan has been involved in The Heroes Project, founded by his friend Tim Medvetz, which is dedicated to helping soldiers and their families. As part of the project he took part in a climb up Mount Rainier in 2012, accompanying a former soldier with a prosthetic limb. During this climb, McKagan suffered a potentially fatal cerebral edema.

It was announced in 2012 that Rainstorm Entertainment will produce a &quot;biographical documentary&quot; based on &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy (And Other Lies)&quot;. McKagan is listed as a producer and writer. The film, titled &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy (And Other Lies)&quot; after the book, was released in May 2016. Those interviewed for the project include Mick Jagger, Elton John, Slash, Joe Elliott and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Following an appearance with the Hollywood Vampires at the 2016 Grammy Awards ceremony in tribute to Lemmy Kilmister, McKagan was considered a member of the supergroup, although his time in the band was short-lived as he returned to Guns N&#x27; Roses two months later.

== Personal life ==

On May 28, 1988, McKagan married his first wife, Mandy Brixx; the couple divorced on April 1, 1990. In September 1992, he married Linda Johnson; this too ended in divorce in September 1995. On August 28, 1999, he married Susan Holmes. They have two daughters together. McKagan and his family reside in Seattle.

McKagan was one of the last people confirmed to have seen Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain before he died on April 5, 1994. He sat next to Cobain on a flight from Los Angeles to Seattle on April 1.
McKagan later recalled, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have any foresight that the guy was going to do what he did. I could tell he was bummed out, and I&#x27;d been that way before... I thought I&#x27;d ask him to come stay at my house; I turned around and he was gone.&quot;

On May 10, 1994, at the age of 30, McKagan became gravely ill due to acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis, which caused his pancreas to swell to the size of a football and leak digestive enzymes into his body. He was taken to Northwest Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, where he was monitored until the swelling had shrunk. McKagan was later told by his doctors that he would be dead within a month if he did not stop drinking. He had made previous efforts to overcome his addiction, but this health crisis was his incentive to get sober for good. In his autobiography, he attributed his sobriety to exercise; first through mountain biking and later, martial arts.

McKagan has also claimed in his autobiography that the fictional product Duff Beer on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was named after him, and has received no royalties, but &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening called the claim &quot;absurd&quot;. &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer Mike Reiss similarly dismissed the claim in his memoir &quot;Springfield Confidential&quot;, stating that he&#x27;d &quot;never heard of [McKagan]&quot;.

A high school drop-out, McKagan enrolled in a basic finance course at Santa Monica Community College in 1994; he explained that going over the financial records from his Guns N&#x27; Roses days had made him want to understand the process more, stating, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t make sense of it. I didn&#x27;t know how much we had made or lost on the tour. As a 30 year-old millionaire, how do I admit to somebody that I don&#x27;t know what the fuck I&#x27;m doing?&quot;

In 2000, after attending several more classes at Seattle Central Community College, McKagan enrolled full-time at Seattle University&#x27;s Albers School of Business and Economics. When Velvet Revolver took off in his final year as an undergraduate student, McKagan took a hiatus from business school to go on tour; he is still one quarter short of graduating.
