<text>Avalancha de Éxitos (in Spanish: &quot;Avalanche of Hits&quot;) is Café Tacuba&#x27;s third album. In 1996, two years after their acclaimed &quot;Re&quot;, the band had amassed enough new music to fill four CDs, but couldn&#x27;t winnow it down to a single album. So instead, they covered eight songs by other Spanish-speaking artists, who ranged from totally obscure to well-known.

== Background ==
After the publication of &quot;Re&quot;, the band was between the releasing of the album and the subsequent tours as well as the fulfillment of the contract with Warne also continue in the scene while have proper time preparing their formal third LP. After their performance at Viña del Mar Festival in 1996, producer Gustavo Santaolalla proposed them a &quot;transition album&quot; made with covers, an idea that the group accepted. Since its formation the group used to perform versions of other bands that they liked.

== Composition ==
The concept of the album allowed Café Tacvba to focus on the creativity of the music, so they agreed to start the rehearsals by each member of the band bringing ideas of what songs would be included on the album. The group chose several songs related to the rock of Mexico of the 80s:

The first round of songs chosen for the album included &quot;Chilanga Banda&quot; (Jaime López), &quot;Estás Perdida&quot; (Ritmo Peligroso), &quot;Planet Earth&quot; (Duran Duran) and &quot;Una Mañana&quot; (originally &quot;Morning&quot; by Clare Fischer, popularized with lyrics in Spanish as &quot;Una Mañana&quot; by José José), the same that the group had already performed for their 1995 MTV Unplugged and which would be published in Un Tributo (a José José) in 1998. Of the latter, Clare Fischer told to Warner production that he hated José José version and he agreed with the recording but with another lyrics so the band then refused to include the song, &quot;we said that for us Clare Fischer did not mean anything, but José José yes&quot;, said about Joselo Rangel. Just Jaime López&#x27;s &quot;Chilanga Banda&quot; remained, a song that the band met by Octavio Hernández, a journalist and cultural promoter from Tijuana.

&quot;Metamorfosis&quot; is a song by the Mexican band Axis, which performed at the concert venues in Ciudad Satélite area where the early band attended and which won the First Youth Rock Festival organized by Peerless label in 1985. Juan Luis Guerra&#x27;s &quot;Ojalá Que Llueva Café&quot; was chosen by the band as it was a song they liked from the time they were students and was remade at the initiative of Meme as a son huasteco, given the previous work that was done by the band with &quot;maestro huapanguero&quot; Alejandro Flores in &quot;Las flores&quot; for the band&#x27;s MTV Unplugged. &quot;No me comprendes&quot; by Bola de Nieve was Quique&#x27;s suggestion, while the band unanimously decided «Alármala de tos» by Botellita de Jerez and &quot;No controles&quot;, one of the hits in Mexico by Flans in the 80s —version to Spanish band Olé Olé— and that the group chose to listen to at the parties they attended. &quot;Perfidia&quot; published in 1939 by Alberto Domínguez was chosen from the beginning as an instrumental track in tribute to the instrumental music of the 60s such as Santo &amp; Johnny and The Ventures. &quot;Cómo te extraño&quot;, a 1964 song by Leo Dan was included at the suggestion by Warner executives. The title of &quot;Avalancha de éxitos&quot; is a word game that by one side pay homage to 60s and 50s names of compilation albums that only included hits of some musical groups and by the other refers to &quot;Avalancha a&quot; popular soap-box cart that is depicted on the front of the album artwork.

Among the rhythms included in the album are ska, bolero, heavy metal, post-rock, hip-hop, punk and son huasteco.

== Recording ==
Unlike their previous album &quot;Avalancha de éxitos&quot; was recorded in Mexico, at the band&#x27;s first rehearsal venue in Naucalpan. The band used a console with equalizers provided by Gustavo Santaolalla with two microphones using an ADAT portable recorder. David Byrne participated in &quot;No Controles&quot;. Some incidental noises caused by recording in a rehearsal room were left in the final product.

== Promotion ==
&quot;Avalancha de Éxitos&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to reach a high place on the US Billboard chart, peaking number 12. In Mexico, like the previous album &quot;Re&quot;, it would have a moderate reception. Outside of Mexico the album opened the doors to the Spanish-speaking market, taking them in addition to the United States and Chile, where they had already performed, on a two-and-a-half-month tour of countries in which they had not performed, including all of Central America, South America and Caribbean countries like Cuba and the Dominican Republic.

The promotional video for the album was that of &quot;Chilanga banda&quot; which was directed by Ángel Flores with art by Eugenio Caballero.

<text>Hans Herr (September 17, 1639 – October 11, 1725) was born in Zürich, Switzerland. While often cited as a descendant of the knight Hugo Herr, scholarship done in the 20th century has put this claim in doubt. He joined the Swiss Brethren (later called Mennonites) and became a bishop. He was the first Mennonite bishop to emigrate to America.

When religious persecution became unendurable in Switzerland, many of his congregation emigrated with him to the Electorate of the Palatinate in Germany, which was governed by a ruler who promised them protection and religious freedom. This was satisfactory until the Palatinate fell into the hands of other rulers, subjecting the Mennonites to severe religious persecution once again. When this occurred, a number of them visited William Penn in London, in 1707, and arranged terms with him to colonize a portion of what is now Lancaster County, near what was then the western frontier of Pennsylvania. In 1710, Hans Herr, John R. Bundely, Martin Meylin (Mylin), Martin Kendig, Jacob Miller, Hans Funk, Hans Graff, Martin Oberholtzer, Wendel Bowman and others bought 10,000 acres (40 km2) of land on the south side of Pequea Creek. A warrant was issued for the land October 10, 1710, and it was surveyed October 23, 1710.

The tradition, which has never been disproven, is that these immigrants held a conference as to what steps should be taken to inform their relatives and friends in Europe of their opinions and expectations of their new lands, and it was determined that Hans Herr, their revered minister, should return, explain the situation and the great advantages of emigration, and bring with him those he could induce to come. He sailed to Europe and returned to America with many more immigrants, despite making the journey at 70 years old. He had six sons and one daughter by his wife Elizabeth Kendig. He died in West Lampeter Township on October 11, 1725.

==House and museum==

The Hans Herr House, built by his son Christian Herr in 1719, is open to the public as a museum, and is the oldest Pennsylvania German settlement still in existence today. The house is located at 1849 Hans Herr Drive in Willow Street, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="626455" wikidata="Q1077952" url="?curid=626455" title="Alternative fuel">
<text>Alternative fuels, also known as non-conventional and advanced fuels, are fuels derived from sources other than petroleum. Alternative fuels include gaseous fossil fuels like propane, natural gas, methane, and ammonia; biofuels like biodiesel, bioalcohol, and refuse-derived fuel; and other renewable fuels like hydrogen and electricity.

These fuels are intended to substitute for more carbon intensive energy sources like gasoline and diesel in transportation and can help to contribute to decarbonization and reductions in pollution. Alternative fuel is also shown to reduce non-carbon emissions such as the release of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, as well as sulfur dioxide and other harmful gases in the exhaust. This is especially important in industries such as mining, where toxic gases can accumulate more easily.

==Official definitions==
===Definition in the European Union===
In the European Union, alternative fuel is defined by Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure.

===Definition in the US===

In the US, the EPA defines alternative fuel as
===Definition in Canada===

In Canada, since 1996, Alternative Fuels Regulations SOR/96-453 Alternative Fuels Act defined alternative fuel:
===China===
In China, alternative fuel vehicles should comply with technical guidelines for the local production of alternative-fuel vehicles: they should have a shelf life of more than , and a complete charge should take less than seven hours. Up to 80% of a charge must be available after less than 30 minutes of charging. In addition, pure-electric vehicles must consume electric energy of less than 0.16 kWh/km.

==Biofuel==

Biofuels are also considered a renewable source. Although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity, it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels.
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of arable land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage.

===Biomass===

Biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production. It has become popular among coal power stations, which switch from coal to biomass in order to convert to renewable energy generation without wasting existing generating plant and infrastructure. Biomass most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed, and are specifically called nitrocellulose biomass. As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel.

===Algae fuel===
Algae-based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems. Algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production. Algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the U.S. Navy Algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices.

===Biodiesel===
Biodiesel is made from animal fats or vegetable oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as atrophy, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, diesel is produced from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release a smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide, particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the LSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.

==Alcohol fuels==
Methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy; they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy. These alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels. Butane has another advantage: it is the only alcohol-based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum-product pipeline networks, instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad cars.

== Ammonia ==

Ammonia (NH3) can be used as fuel. Benefits of ammonia for ships include reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nitrogen reduction is being considered as a possible component for fuel cells and combustion engines through research of conversion of ammonia to nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas.

Ammonia is the simplest molecule that carries hydrogen in a liquid form. It is carbon-free and can be produced using renewable energy. Ammonia can become a transitional fuel soon because of its relative easiness of storage and distribution.

== Emulsion fuel ==

Emulsified fuels include multiple components that are mixed to a water-in-oil emulsion, which are created to improve the fuels combustive properties. Diesel can also be emulsified with water to be used as a fuel. It helps in improving engine efficiency and reducing exhaust emissions.

== Carbon-neutral and negative fuels ==

Carbon-neutral fuel is synthetic fuel—such as methane, gasoline, diesel fuel or jet fuel—produced from renewable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbolic acid in seawater. Such fuels are potentially carbon neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases. To the extent that carbon neutral fuels displace fossil fuels, or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbolic acid, and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe, they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere, and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation. Such carbon neutral and negative fuels can be produced by the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen used in the Sabatier reaction to produce methane which may then be stored to be burned later in power plants as synthetic natural gas, transported by pipeline, truck, or tanker ship, or be used in gas to liquids processes such as the Fischer–Tropsch process to make traditional transportation or heating fuels.

Carbon-neutral fuels have been proposed for distributed storage for renewable energy, minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittent, and enabling transmission of wind, water, and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines. Such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels, enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles. Germany has built a 250-kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts. Audi has constructed a carbon neutral liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Werlte, Germany. The plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset LNG used in their A3 Sportback g-tron automobiles, and can keep 2,800 metric tons of CO2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity. Other commercial developments are taking place in Columbia, South Carolina, Camarillo, California, and Darlington, England.

The least expensive source of carbon for recycling into fuel is flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, where it can be extracted for about US $7.50 per ton. Automobile exhaust gas capture has also been proposed to be economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting. Since carbonic acid in seawater is in chemical equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide, extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied. Researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about $50 per ton. Carbon capture from ambient air is more costly, at between $600 and $1000 per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration.

Nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U.S. averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009, but only 0.71 cents/kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day. Typically, wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 cents/kWh during the day. Commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce fuel for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel. The U.S. Navy estimates that shipboard production of jet fuel from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon. While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive. However, U.S. civilian nuclear power is considerably more expensive than wind power. The Navy&#x27;s estimate that 100 megawatts can produce 41,000 gallons of fuel per day indicates that terrestrial production from wind power would cost less than $1 per gallon.

==Hydrogen and formic acid==

Hydrogen is an emissionless fuel. The byproduct of hydrogen burning is water, although some mono-nitrogen oxides NOx are produced when hydrogen is burned with air.
Another fuel is formic acid. The fuel is used by converting it first to hydrogen and using that in a fuel cell. Formic acid is much more easy to store than hydrogen.

==Hydrogen/compressed natural gas mixture==
HCNG (or H2CNG) is a mixture of compressed natural gas and 4–9 percent hydrogen by energy.
Hydrogen could also be used as hydroxy gas for better combustion characteristics of compression-ignition engines. Hydroxy gas is obtained through electrolysis of water.

==Compressed air==
The air engine is an emission-free piston engine using compressed air as fuel.

==Propane autogas==

Propane is a cleaner burning, high-performance fuel derived from multiple sources. It is known by many names including propane, LPG (liquified propane gas), LPA (liquid propane autogas), Autogas and others. Propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natural gas family.

Propane as an automotive fuel shares many of the physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well to wheel emissions overall. Propane is the number one alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply, liquid storage at low pressure, an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels.

Propane delivers an octane rating between 104 and 112 depending on the composition of the butane/propane ratios of the mixture. Propane autogas in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an &quot;intercooler&quot; effect, reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density. The resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion.

Propane lacks additives, detergents or other chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe. The cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions, lower NOx due to the complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder, higher exhaust temperatures increasing the efficiency of the catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil.

Propane autogas is generated at the well alongside other natural gas and oil products. It is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of Propane to the market.

Propane is stored and transported in a liquid state at roughly of pressure. Fueling vehicles are similar to gasoline in the speed of delivery with modern fueling equipment. Propane filling stations only require a pump to transfer vehicle fuel and do not require expensive and slow compression systems when compared to compressed natural gas which is usually kept at over .

In a vehicle format, propane autogas can be retrofitted to almost any engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large, pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles.

==Compressed natural gas==
Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are two cleaner combustible alternatives to conventional liquid automobile fuels.

=== Compressed natural gas fuel types ===
CNG vehicles can use both renewable CNG and non-renewable CNG.

Conventional CNG is a fossil fuel. New technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically access unconventional gas resources, appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way.

Renewable natural gas or biogas is a methane-based gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel. Present sources of biogas are mainly landfills, sewage, and animal/agri-waste. Based on the process type, biogas can be divided into the following: biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, landfill gas collected from landfills, treated to remove trace contaminants, and synthetic natural gas (SNG).

=== Practicality ===
CNG powers more than 5 million vehicles worldwide, and just over 150,000 of these are in the U.S. American usage is growing at a dramatic rate.

=== Environmental analysis ===
Because natural gas emits less smog-forming pollutants than other fossil fuels when combusted, cleaner air has been measured in urban localities switching to natural gas vehicles. Tailpipe can be reduced by 15–25% compared to gasoline, diesel. The greatest reductions occur in medium and heavy duty, light duty and refuse truck segments.

 reductions of up to 88% are possible by using biogas.

Natural gas and hydrogen are both lighter than air and can be mixed together.

==Nuclear power and radiothermal generators==
=== Nuclear reactors ===
Nuclear power is any nuclear technology designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions. Currently, the only controlled method uses nuclear fission in a fissile fuel (with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent radioactive decay). Use of nuclear fusion for controlled power generation is not yet practical, but is an active area of research.

Nuclear power generally requires a nuclear reactor to heat a working fluid such as water, which is then used to create steam pressure, which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water. Today, more than 15% of the world&#x27;s electricity comes from nuclear power, and over 150 nuclear-powered naval vessels have been built.

In theory, electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for propulsion in space, but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight. Some smaller reactors, such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor, are built to minimize moving parts and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly, making them useful for space missions, but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes. Power from nuclear fission has been used in a number of spacecraft, all of them uncrewed. The Soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in RORSAT military radar satellites, where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the Earth&#x27;s oceans. The U.S. also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965, in the SNAP-10A mission.

===Thorium fuelled nuclear reactors===

Thorium-based nuclear power reactors have also become an area of active research in recent years. It is being backed by many scientists and researchers, and Professor James Hansen, the former Director at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies has reportedly said, &quot;After studying climate change for over four decades, it&#x27;s clear to me that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace fossil fuels. Safer, cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and is desperately needed as an essential part of the solution&quot;. Thorium is 3–4 times more abundant within nature than uranium, and its ore, monazite, is commonly found in sands along bodies of water. Thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium. While uranium mines are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, thorium is taken from open pits. Monazite is present in countries such as Australia, the United States and India, in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years. As an alternative to uranium-fuelled nuclear reactors, thorium has been proven to add to proliferation, produces radioactive waste for deep geological repositories like technetium-99 (half-life over 200,000 years), and has a longer fuel cycle.

For a list of experimental and presently-operating thorium-fueled reactors, see .

=== Radiothermal generators ===
In addition, radioisotopes have been used as alternative fuels, on both lands, and in space. Their use on land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened. The decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes, particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak, and low temperatures is a problem. Radiothermal generators (RTGs) which use radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction, but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope.

<text>The 1974 Canadian federal election was held on July 8, 1974, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 30th Parliament of Canada. The governing Liberal Party was reelected, going from a minority to a majority government, and gave Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau his third term. The Progressive Conservatives, led by Robert Stanfield, did well in the Atlantic provinces, and in the West, but Liberal support in Ontario and Quebec ensured a majority Liberal government.

==Overview ==

The previous election had resulted in the Liberals emerging as the largest party, but far short of a majority, and only two seats ahead of the Progressive Conservatives. They were able to form a government with the support of the New Democratic Party, but the NDP withdrew their backing in May 1974 and voted with the Progressive Conservatives to bring down Trudeau&#x27;s government in protest of a budget proposed by finance minister John Turner, which the opposition parties felt did not go far enough to control spiralling inflation.

The issue of inflation would become key in the election campaign. Stanfield had proposed a &quot;90-day wage and price freeze&quot; to break the momentum of inflation. Trudeau had ridiculed this policy as an intrusion on the rights of businesses and employees to set or negotiate their own prices and wages with the catch-phrase, &quot;Zap! You&#x27;re frozen!&quot; In 1975, Trudeau introduced his own wage and price control system under the auspices of the &quot;Anti-Inflation Board&quot;.

While polls at the election campaign&#x27;s outset had projected that the Progressive Conservatives would at least win a minority government, they in fact lost nearly a dozen seats. The Conservative campaign was also hurt by other factors, including Stanfield giving what was considered to be a poor interview immediately after the vote of no confidence in Trudeau&#x27;s government, in which he could not name any potential Tory policies for the forthcoming election, and then by a bungled photo op later in the campaign when he attempted to play catch with some assembled journalists, only to fumble and drop the football.

The New Democratic Party, led by David Lewis, lost less than two-and-a-half percentage points in the popular vote, but lost almost half of their seats in the House of Commons. It was the worst result in the party&#x27;s history up until that point, with only their performances in 1993 and 2000 to date being worse. They were hurt principally by the collapse of their vote in British Columbia; having won the popular vote and most seats in the province two years prior, the NDP were almost totally wiped out there during this election, losing all but two of their seats and finishing a distant third behind the Liberals and Tories. Their poor showing was blamed primarily on Lewis strongly hinting prior to the election that he would back Stanfield over Trudeau in the event of another minority parliament - which may have caused left-wing voters to vote for the Liberals in order to keep the Tories out of power - and also by an unpopular mineral tax introduced by the provincial British Columbia government of Dave Barrett, which would lead to Barrett&#x27;s government suffering a landslide loss in the following year&#x27;s provincial election.

The Social Credit Party of Canada, led by Réal Caouette, began to lose ground, and fell to 11 seats, one short of the number required to be recognized as a party in the House of Commons (and therefore qualify for research funds and parliamentary committee memberships). This status was nonetheless extended to the party by the governing Liberals, who believed that Social Credit&#x27;s support came primarily at the expense of the Tories.

One seat was won in New Brunswick by independent candidate Leonard Jones. Jones, the former mayor of Moncton, had secured the Progressive Conservative nomination, but PC leader Stanfield refused to sign Jones&#x27; nomination papers because he was a vocal opponent of official bilingualism, which the PC Party supported. Jones had opposed providing services in French in the City of Moncton even though 30% of the city&#x27;s population was francophone. Jones ran and won as an independent. After the election, Social Credit leader Caouette invited Jones to join the Socred caucus, which would have given that party enough members for official status. Caouette justified the invitation on the basis that Jones agreed with providing bilingual education at the primary school level. Jones declined Caouette&#x27;s invitation, and sat as an independent.

Of the four major party leaders, only Trudeau would remain in place for the following federal election five years later. Stanfield, having failed to defeat the Liberals in any of his three elections as leader, faced pressure to stand down and eventually did so in 1976, being succeeded by Joe Clark. Lewis&#x27; position was rendered untenable by the loss of his own seat, and he was forced to stand down within a year of the election (though it later transpired that he had intended to retire in 1975 regardless of the election result, as he had secretly been battling leukaemia); Ed Broadbent initially replaced him as interim leader, and was subsequently elected to the position permanently. Caouette, who had only been able to play a minimal role in the election due to injuries sustained in a snowmobiling accident, stood down as leader of the Socreds in late 1976 and died not long afterwards; a succession of leaders took charge in the years ahead, ultimately leaving Fabien Roy as the man who would lead them into the next election.

<text>The Lockheed Ventura is a twin-engine medium bomber and patrol bomber of World War II.

The Ventura first entered combat in Europe as a bomber with the RAF in late 1942. Designated PV-1 by the United States Navy (US Navy), it entered combat in 1943 in the Pacific. The bomber was also used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), which designated it the Lockheed B-34 (&quot;Lexington&quot;) and B-37 as a trainer. British Commonwealth forces also used it in several guises, including antishipping and antisubmarine search and attack.

The Ventura was developed from the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar transport, as a replacement for the Lockheed Hudson bombers then in service with the Royal Air Force. Used in daylight attacks against occupied Europe, they proved to have weaknesses and were removed from bomber duty and some used for patrols by Coastal Command.

After USAAF monopolization of land-based bombers was removed, the US Navy ordered a revised design which entered service as the PV-2 Harpoon for anti-submarine work.

==Development==

===Lockheed Ventura/B-34 Lexington===
At the start of the war, Lockheed proposed military conversions of the Lodestar for the RAF as replacement for the Hudson reconnaissance aircraft and the Bristol Blenheim bomber. The first British order was placed in February 1940 for 25 Model 32 as bombers. This was followed by an order for 300 Model 37 with Double Wasp engines, then for a further 375 later in 1940. Lockheed needed more production capacity and nearby Vega Aircraft Corporation was contracted for building the Ventura.

The Ventura was very similar to its predecessor, the Lockheed Hudson. The primary difference was not in layout; rather, the Ventura was larger, heavier, and used more powerful engines than the Hudson. The RAF ordered 188 Venturas in February 1940, which were delivered from mid-1942. Venturas were initially used for daylight raids on occupied Europe but, like some other RAF bombers, they proved too vulnerable without fighter escort, which was difficult to provide for long-range missions. Venturas were replaced by the faster de Havilland Mosquito. The Venturas were transferred to patrol duties with Coastal Command as the Mosquito replaced them in bomber squadrons; 30 went to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and some to the South African Air Force (SAAF). The RAF placed an order for 487 Ventura Mark IIs but many of these were diverted to the USAAF, which placed its own order for 200 Ventura Mark IIA as the B-34 Lexington, later renamed RB-34.

===Lockheed B-37===
In August 1941, large orders for Venturas were placed with Lend-Lease Act money. Among the orders were for 550 armed reconnaissance versions of the Ventura. This aircraft was originally planned to be built under the designation O-56. The main differences between the Ventura and the O-56 were in the engines: rather than the 2,000 hp (1,491 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 radials of the Ventura, the O-56 used 1,700 hp (1,270 kW) Wright R-2600-13 radials.

Before completion of the first O-56, the U.S. Army Air Forces dropped the &quot;O-&quot; category used to designate &quot;observation&quot; (reconnaissance) aircraft. The O-56 was redesignated the RB-34B (the &quot;R&quot; denoted &#x27;restricted&#x27; meaning it was not to be used for combat). Before the first of these flew, the design was redesignated again as the B-37 with a higher powered version of the R-2600, later it also was designated the RB-37.

While 550 were ordered by the Army Air Forces, acquisition by the USAAF stopped after only 18 Venturas were accepted, when the Army Air Forces agreed to turn over exclusive use of the Ventura to the United States Navy.

===PV-1 Ventura===
The PV-1 Ventura, built by the Vega Aircraft Company division of Lockheed (hence the &quot;V&quot; Navy manufacturer&#x27;s letter that later replaced the &quot;O&quot; for Lockheed), was a version of the Ventura built for the U.S. Navy (see Venturas in U.S. Navy service below). The main differences between the PV-1 and the B-34 were the inclusion of special equipment in the PV-1, adapting it to its patrol bombing role. The maximum fuel capacity of the PV-1 was increased from 1,345 gal (5,081 L) to 1,607 gal (6,082 L), to increase its range; the forward defensive armament was also reduced for this reason. The most important addition was of an ASD-1 search radar.

Early production PV-1s still carried a bombardier&#x27;s station behind the nose radome, with four side windows and a flat bomb-aiming panel underneath the nose. Late production PV-1s dispensed with this bombardier position and replaced it with a pack with three 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns underneath the nose. These aircraft could also carry eight 5-inch (127 mm) HVAR rockets on launchers underneath the wings.

The PV-1 began to be delivered in December 1942, and entered service in February 1943. The first squadron in combat was VP-135, deployed in the Aleutian Islands in April 1943. They were operated by three other squadrons in this theatre. From the Aleutians, they flew strikes against bases in Paramushiro and Shimushu, Japanese islands in the Kurile chain. Often, PV-1s would lead B-24 bomber formations, since they were equipped with radar. In late 1943, some PV-1s were deployed to the Solomon Islands as night fighters with VMF(N)-531, a Marine Corps fighter squadron.

===PV-2 Harpoon===

The PV-2 Harpoon was a major redesign of the Ventura with the wing area increased from 551 ft2 (51.2 m2) to 686 ft2 (63.7 m2) giving an increased load-carrying capability, and which first flew on 3 December 1943. The motivation for redesign was weaknesses in the PV-1, which had shown itself to have problems in taking off when carrying a full load of fuel. On the PV-2, the armament became standardized at five forward-firing machine guns. Many early PV-1s had a bombardier&#x27;s position, which was deleted in the PV-2. Some other significant developments included the increase of the bombload by 30% to 4,000 lb (1,800 kg), and the ability to carry eight 5-inch (127 mm) HVAR rockets under the wings.

While the PV-2 was expected to have increased range and better takeoff, the anticipated speed statistics were projected lower than those of the PV-1, due to the use of the same engines but an increase in weight. The Navy ordered 500 examples, designating them with the popular name &quot;Harpoon&quot;.

Early tests indicated a tendency for the wings to wrinkle dangerously. As this problem could not be solved by a 6 ft (1.8 m) reduction in wingspan (making the wing uniformly flexible), a complete redesign of the wing was necessitated. This hurdle delayed entry of the PV-2 into service. The PV-2s already delivered were used for training purposes under the designation PV-2C. By the end of 1944, only 69 PV-2s had been delivered. They finally resumed when the redesign was complete. The first aircraft shipped were the PV-2D, which had eight forward-firing machine guns and was used in ground attacks. When World War II ended, all of the order was cancelled.

With the wing problems fixed, the PV-2 proved reliable, and eventually popular. It was first used in the Aleutians by VP-139, one of the squadrons that originally used the PV-1. It was used by a number of countries after the war&#x27;s end, but the United States ceased ordering new PV-2s, and they were all soon retired from service.
===Civil conversions===

Ex-military PV-1 Venturas from Canada and South Africa were converted by Howard Aero in San Antonio, Texas, in the 1950s and 1960s as high-speed executive transports. The earliest conversions, called Super Venturas, incorporated a 48 in (122 cm) fuselage stretch, extra fuel tankage, large picture windows, luxury interiors, and weapons bays transformed into baggage compartments. The landing gear was swapped for the heavier-duty units from the PV-2. Later conversions, of which eighteen were completed in the 1960s, were called Howard 350s.

At least nineteen PV-1s were further modified, including cabin pressurization under the designation Howard 500. A final PV-1 modification by Howard was the Eldorado 700, with longer wings, a pointed nose, and streamlined engine cowlings.

A notable crash of a civilian version occurred on 17 December 1954, killing four, including Fred Miller, president of the Miller Brewing Company and grandson of founder Frederick Miller. The company plane was bound for Winnipeg, Manitoba, but had trouble with both engines and crashed shortly after takeoff from Mitchell Field in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Also killed were his oldest son, 20-year-old Fred, Jr., and the two company pilots, Joseph and Paul Laird.

Oakland Airmotive (later Bay Aviation Services, based in Oakland, California) also offered a PV-2 executive aircraft conversion dubbed Centaurus starting in 1958. The cost of the conversion was $155,000 in addition to the airframe.

==Operational history==
===Portuguese Air Force===
The Portuguese Air Force received 42 Lockheed PV-2C Harpoons from 1953, which replaced the Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver as an anti-submarine aircraft. The Harpoons equipped squadrons 61 and 62 at the Montijo Air Base. In 1960, the Harpoons were replaced as maritime patrol and anti-submarine aircraft by Lockheed P2V-5 Neptunes. The remaining Harpoons were sent to Angola and Mozambique, where they formed Squadron 91 operating from Luanda Air Base and Squadron 101 from Beira Air Base. The Harpoons were used on operations in the Angolan and Mozambican theatres of the Portuguese Overseas War (1961–1974). They served mainly as light bombers and ground attack aircraft, with occasional reconnaissance, transport and maritime patrol sorties. The last Portuguese Harpoons were retired in 1975. The Museu do Ar (Portuguese Air Museum) has what is believed to be the only remaining Lockheed PV-2C Harpoon in Europe.

===Royal Air Force===

The first Ventura Mark Is were accepted by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in September 1941, with aircraft being delivered to Britain from April 1942. By the end of August, enough Venturas had arrived to equip No. 21 Squadron RAF, No. 487 Squadron RNZAF and No. 464 Squadron RAAF. The Ventura flew its first operational mission for the RAF on 3 November 1942, when three Venturas of 21 Squadron attacked railway targets near Hengelo in the Netherlands. On 6 December 1942, 47 Venturas from 21, 464 (RAAF) and 487 (RNZAF) squadrons participated in Operation Oyster, the large daylight 2 Group raid against the Philips radio and vacuum tube factories at Eindhoven. Also committed to the raid were 36 Bostons and 10 de Havilland Mosquitos.

Carrying incendiaries, they were placed in the third wave of aircraft, and suffered the highest rate of loss. Nine of the 47 Venturas were shot down and many others were damaged by flak or bird strikes. The force also lost four Bostons and one Mosquito. Six months later, on 3 May 1943, Venturas of 487 Squadron RNZAF were sent on Operation Ramrod 16, an attack on a power station in Amsterdam. The squadron was told that the target was of such importance to Dutch morale, that the attack was to be continued regardless of opposition. Significant problems developed with rendezvousing with the escorting fighters, with the result that all 10 Venturas that crossed the coast were lost to German fighters. Squadron Leader Leonard Trent (later the last of the Great Escapers) won the Victoria Cross for his leadership in this raid.

The Ventura was never very popular among RAF crews. Although it was faster and carried more than twice the bomb load of its predecessor, the Hudson, it proved unsatisfactory as a bomber. By the summer of 1943, the Ventura had been replaced by the de Havilland Mosquito. The last Ventura raid was flown by 21 Squadron on 9 September 1943. Some Venturas were modified to be used by Coastal Command as the Ventura G.R.I. and 387 PV-1s were used by the RAF as the Ventura G.R.V in the Mediterranean and by Coastal Command. Some RAF aircraft were modified into Ventura C.V transport aircraft. A small number of Venturas were also used in other air forces, including the RCAF, RNZAF and SAAF.

===Royal Australian Air Force===
In the United Kingdom, No. 464 Squadron RAAF formed (mixture of Commonwealth personnel) at RAF Feltwell in September 1942 to operate the Ventura as part of 2 Group, Bomber Command; it converted to the de Havilland Mosquito in September 1943. In the Mediterranean, No. 459 Squadron RAAF was equipped with the Ventura V between December 1943 to July 1944, flying mainly anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols.

In Australia, 55 PV-1s were supplied to the RAAF for use in the South West Pacific Area. No. 13 Squadron RAAF was the only operational squadron in Australia equipped with the Ventura. It operated primarily in north-eastern Queensland and then the Northern Territory, and later serving in the Borneo campaign of 1945. After the war, the squadron used its aircraft to help transport liberated prisoners of war.

===Royal Canadian Air Force===
A total of 157 Ventura G.R. Mk. Vs were used operationally by the RCAF from 16 June 1942 to 18 April 1947 in the home defence coastal patrol role in both Eastern and Western Air Command. They were flown by 8, 113, 115, 145, and 149 Squadrons. A further 21 Ventura Mk. Is and 108 Ventura Mk. IIs were used in a training role at 1 Central Flying School, Trenton, Ontario, and at RCAF Station Pennfield Ridge, New Brunswick (RAF No. 34 Operational Training Unit) as part of the BCATP. A total of 21 Mk. Is, 108 Mk. IIs, and 157 G.R. Mk. Vs were in service during this period for a total of 286 aircraft.

===South African Air Force===
The SAAF also received some 135 PV-1s, which were used to protect shipping around the Cape of Good Hope and to bomb Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. In December 1942 four SAAF Venturas dropped supplies to survivors of the shipwreck on South-West Africa&#x27;s Skeleton Coast. Venturas served in the South African Air Force until 1960.

===Soviet Air Force===
A few US Navy PV-1s force-landed in the Soviet Union after attacking Japanese targets on the Kurile islands and were impounded. Some of them were repaired and pressed into service by the Soviet Air Force where the type became known as the B-34. By December 1944, eight planes were located on airfields on Kamchatka: four were fully airworthy, three were undergoing repairs and one was a write-off.

By 1945 seven PV-1s (five of them being airworthy) were used by the Soviets, one plane was the personal liaison aircraft of Ltc M.A. Yeryomin. The planes were used during the Soviet-Japanese campaign in August 1945. After the end of the war only one aircraft remained in service.

===Royal New Zealand Air Force===

From August 1942, 487 Squadron RNZAF, (operating in Europe as part of the RAF), was equipped with the type, although losses (including on 3 May 1943 the loss of all 11 aircraft attacking Amsterdam), led to their replacement with the de Havilland Mosquito in June.

The Royal New Zealand Air Force in the Pacific received 139 Venturas and some Harpoons from June 1943 to replace Lockheed Hudsons in the maritime patrol bomber and medium bomber roles. Initially Venturas were unpopular with the RNZAF due to rumoured poor performance on one engine, the fate of Squadron Leader Leonard Trent VC of 487 Squadron (above) as well as the failure of the U.S. to provide New Zealand with promised B-24 Liberators. Despite that the RNZAF Venturas came to be among the most widely used of any nation&#x27;s, seeing substantial action until VJ Day over South West Pacific islands.

The first 19 RB-34s that arrived by sea from the U.S. in June had much equipment either missing or damaged. Six airworthy machines were hurriedly produced by cannibalization and sent into action with No. 3 Squadron RNZAF in Fiji. On 26 June the first PV-1s were flown to Whenuapai and No. 1 Squadron RNZAF was able to convert to 18 of these by 1 August, then replacing the mixed 3 Squadron in action at Henderson Field, Guadalcanal in late October.

By this time No. 2 Squadron RNZAF at Ohakea and No. 9 Squadron RNZAF were also using the type. The following year No. 4 Squadron RNZAF and No. 8 Squadron RNZAF also received Venturas. Some squadrons were retained on &quot;garrison&quot; duty while others followed the allied advance to Emirau and Green Island and to New Britain. RNZAF Venturas were tasked with routine patrols, anti-shipping strikes, minelaying, bombing and strafing missions, air-sea rescue patrols, and photographic reconnaissance missions.

RNZAF machines often clashed with Japanese fighters, notably during an air-sea rescue patrol on Christmas Eve 1943. NZ4509 was attacked by nine Japanese single-engine fighters over St. George&#x27;s Channel. It shot down three, later confirmed, and claimed two others as probable, although it suffered heavy damage in the action. The pilot, Flying Officer D. Ayson and navigator, Warrant Officer W. Williams, were awarded the DFC. The dorsal turret gunner Flight Sergeant G. Hannah was awarded the DFM.

By late 1944 the Ventura began to be phased out of frontline action as the RNZAF backed away from the Patrol Bomber concept, orders for PV-2 Harpoons were canceled after a handful of aircraft had been delivered. At VJ Day only 30 PV-1 aircraft remained on the front-line with No. 3 Squadron at Jacquinot Bay.

Planned re-equipment with de Havilland Mosquitos did not take place until after the cessation of hostilities. The last Ventura unit was No. 2 Squadron, which continued to operate PV-1 and PV-2 aircraft on meteorological duty until 1948. A restored RNZAF RB-34 (NZ4600) is owned by the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland.

===United States Army Air Forces===
Some 264 Ventura Mark IIs ordered by the RAF were transferred to the U.S. Army Air Force. Though some were used as anti-submarine patrol bombers under the designation B-34 Lexington, most were used for training with various stateside units. Twenty-seven of these were used by the U.S. Navy for anti-submarine patrols as well; these were designated PV-1 Ventura and PV-2 Harpoon.

===United States Navy===


During the early months of 1942, the primary responsibility for anti-submarine warfare in the United States was shouldered by the Army Air Forces. This irked the Navy, as it considered this region of battle its burden. To carry out such a task, the Navy was pursuing a long-range, land-based patrol and reconnaissance aircraft with a substantial bomb load. This goal was always resisted by the Army Air Forces, which carefully protected its monopoly on land-based bombing. This forced the navy to use long-range floatplanes for these roles. The Navy was unable to upgrade to more capable aircraft until the Army Air Forces needed the Navy plant in Renton, Washington to manufacture its Boeing B-29 Superfortress. In exchange for use of the Renton plant, the Army Air Forces would discontinue its objections to Naval land-based bombers, and provide aircraft to the Navy. One of the clauses of this agreement stated that production of the B-34 and B-37 by Lockheed would cease, and instead these resources would be directed at building a navalized version, the PV-1 Ventura.

The PV-1 began to be delivered in December 1942, and entered service in February 1943. The first squadron in combat was VP-135, deployed in the Aleutian Islands in April 1943. They were operated by three other squadrons in this theatre. From the Aleutians, they flew strikes against Paramushiro, a Japanese island. Often, PV-1s would lead B-24 bomber formations, since they were equipped with radar. In late 1943, PV-1s were deployed to the Solomon Islands and to the newly captured field at Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands. After the war, the U.S. Navy deemed many PV-1s obsolete and the aircraft were sent to Naval Air Station Clinton, Oklahoma to be demilitarized and reduced to scrap.

<text>Engelbert of [[Cleves]], [[Count of Nevers]] (26 September 1462 – 21 November 1506) was the younger son of John I, Duke of Cleves and Elizabeth of Nevers, only surviving child of John II, Count of Nevers.

In 1481, Engelbert was sent with a large army to the Bishopric of Utrecht by his brother John II, Duke of Cleves where they successfully ousted David of Burgundy. But after the Siege of Utrecht (1483) he had to flee, and Utrecht returned to the control of Burgundy.
Engelbert married Charlotte of Bourbon-Vendôme (1474-1520), daughter of John VIII, Count of Vendôme, circa 1489. They had three children :
* Charles II, Count of Nevers, married Marie of Albret, Countess of Rethel 
* Louis of Cleves (1494-1545), Count of Auxerre (1543-1545), married (1542) to Catherine d&#x27;Amboise, daughter of Charles I d&#x27;Amboise, widow of Christophe de Tournon and Philibert de Beaujeu;
* François of Cleves († 1545), Abbot of Tréport, Prior of Saint-Éloi in Paris

Engelbert became Count of Nevers and Eu in 1491 upon the death of his maternal grandfather John II, Count of Nevers. His eldest brother John II (1458–1521) inherited Cleves.

<text>Mark Anthony James Vaile (born 18 April 1956) served as the 12th deputy prime minister of Australia and the leader of the National Party of Australia. Vaile is currently a non-executive director of a number of public listed corporations.

==Early life==
Vaile was born in Sydney and worked as a farm machinery retailer and stock and station and real-estate agent before entering politics. He was a member of the Greater Taree City Council 1985–93, including three years as deputy mayor.

==Parliamentary career==
Vaile was a member of the Australian House of Representatives between March 1993 and July 2008, representing the Division of Lyne in New South Wales. In his first bid for the seat, in the 1993 election, Vaile led over the Liberals by only 233 votes on the third count, despite the seat&#x27;s long history as a National stronghold. Labor had taken a large first-count lead which it held for most of the night, but Vaile won after Liberal preferences flowed overwhelmingly to him. However, had 120 votes gone the other way, the Liberals would have taken the seat. Vaile was able to revert the seat to its traditional status as a safe National seat in 1996, and he would go on to hold the seat without serious difficulty from then onward.

He was Assistant National Party Whip 1994–96 and National Party Whip 1996–97. In 1997 he was appointed Minister for Transport and Regional Development, and in 1998 he became Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In July 1999, following the resignation of Tim Fischer and the election of John Anderson as National Party leader, he was elected the party&#x27;s Deputy Leader and became Minister for Trade. When John Anderson resigned in 2005, Vaile was elected Leader unopposed. On 6 July 2005 he was sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister.

As Trade Minister, Vaile was involved in the negotiation of the US–Australia Free Trade Agreement, which was opposed by some traditional National Party constituencies such as the sugar industry.

There was much controversy over the intellectual property chapter of the US–Australia Free Trade Agreement. The chapter contains elements modelled on the &quot;Sonny Bono Copyright Term extension Act&quot; 1998 (US) and the &quot;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&quot; 1998 (US) In December 2003, Trade Minister Mark Vaile pledged to defend the copyright term in Australia: &quot;It is a very important issue, particularly in terms of cost to libraries, educational institutions and the like here in Australia.&quot; Two months later, Australia agreed to a copyright term extension, as part of the deal with the United States. There was also much criticism of the adoption of a US-style technological protection measures – particularly as the High Court of Australia was considering the matter of Stevens v Sony. There was also controversy over the evergreening of pharmaceutical drug patents and access to essential medicines under the US–Australia Free Trade Agreement.

During 2005 he also conducted negotiations for the proposed Australia–China Free Trade Agreement. In late 2005 he had an operation to remove a malignant melanoma from his back.

Since Vaile took on the leadership of the Nationals in 2005, there were increasing suggestions for Vaile to take on a domestic portfolio as the trade portfolio requires frequent overseas travel. Throughout 2006, Vaile&#x27;s position in the trade portfolio came under increasing scrutiny due to his handling of the AWB kickbacks scandal and Australia&#x27;s worsening trade performance. He also faced the difficult task of placating his back bench, with Queensland Senator Barnaby Joyce having crossed the floor on more than one occasion. On 24 September 2006 he switched portfolios with deputy Nationals leader Warren Truss and became Minister for Transport and Regional Services. His new position had a greater focus on regional Australia, the Nationals party&#x27;s main constituency.

Following the coalition&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 federal election, Vaile resigned his position as Nationals leader and moved to the backbench. His resignation surprised his colleagues as he had been expected to be re-elected unopposed following the election. On 19 July 2008 Vaile announced his forthcoming resignation from Parliament; he submitted it on 30 July. The ensuing by-election was won by independent Rob Oakeshott, the former state member for Port Macquarie and a former Vaile staffer.

==Post-parliament career==
In September 2008, Vaile was appointed to the board of Virgin Australia Holdings. He was replaced by Angus Houston in December 2018.

Vaile is also the independent chairman and a non-executive director of Whitehaven Coal, non-executive director of Palisade Investment Partners, a specialist independent infrastructure manager; a non-executive director of Hostplus, a non-executive director of Servcorp; a director of the Singapore-listed Stamford Land Corporation; and Chairman of 123 Childcare, an education provider in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In June 2021 it was announced that Vaile would succeed Paul Jeans as Chancellor of the University of Newcastle. However following a backlash over his links to the coal industry, Vaile did not take up the post.

==Honours==
On 1 January 2001, Vaile was awarded the Centenary Medal for &quot;service as Minister for Trade&quot;. In 2012 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, through support for rural and regional communities, to the pursuit of global trade and investment opportunities, and to the citizens of the Taree region.

==Personal==
A Roman Catholic, Vaile is married with three children. He lives on a rural property outside Taree, New South Wales.

<text>Meycauayan , officially the City of Meycauayan (), is a 1st class component city in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 225,673 people.

== Etymology ==
The place got its name from the Tagalog words &quot;may kawayan&quot; which is literally translated to English as &quot;there is bamboo&quot;. It was formerly known as &quot;Mecabayan&quot; , a Kapampangan name.

== History ==
During the Spanish colonization of the country, the town of Meycauayan was established as a settlement by a group of Spanish priests belonging to the Franciscan Order. In 1578, its early inhabitants came into contact with Christianity. In that same year, Father Juan de Placencia and Diego Oropesa built the first church structure, which was believed to be made of nipa and bamboo. Common to all Spanish settlements in that period was the adoption of a patron saint for the newly opened town. Meycauayan has St. Francis of Assisi as the Patron Saint. It was only in 1668, however, that a concrete church structure was erected.

Meycauayan was then one of the largest towns in the province of Bulacan. The towns, which fell under its political jurisdiction, were San Jose del Monte, Bocaue, Valenzuela (formerly Polo), Obando, Marilao, Santa Maria and Pandi. It was also regarded as the unofficial capital of the province, being the hub of activities brought about by the establishment of the market center and the presence of the Spanish military detachment. During the revolution, which was set off by the execution of Dr. Jose Rizal in 1896, Meycauayan contributed its share in the fight against the Spanish conquistadores. Among her sons who figured prominently in the revolution were: Andres Pacheco, Ciriaco Contreras, Guillermo Contreras, Guillermo Bonque, Tiburcio Zuela, and Liberato Exaltacion. There were many others who had joined the revolution and had displayed their exceptional heroism until 1898, when the country gained its independence from Spain.

Between 1901 and 1913, Marilao became part of Meycauayan.

In 1949, a big fire razed the market center and several business establishments in the town, causing setbacks to the development of the municipality. It took several years to recover from the destruction and property losses. However, in the 1960s and early part of 1970s, new hope for the development was ushered in. Reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure facilities were made possible through the assistance of the provincial and national governments. A more sound economic base was established and crop production more than doubled.

=== Cityhood ===

Meycauayan twice attempted for cityhood. The first was filed by district representative Angelito Sarmiento, seeking the conversion of the then-municipality of Meycauayan into a component city, which was signed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on March 5, 2001 as &quot;Republic Act No. 9021&quot;.

The plebiscite for the ratification, along with that of Cauayan, Isabela (by virtue of &quot;RA No. 9017&quot; dated February 28), was scheduled by the Commission on Elections on March 30. The bid however failed, and Meycauayan remained a municipality. (Meanwhile, affirmative votes won in the separate plebiscite in Cauayan.)

For the second time, in another attempt for conversion, district representative Reylina Nicolas authored &quot;House Bill 4397&quot; (dated July 24, 2006), which was later signed into law by President Arroyo as &quot;RA No. 9356&quot; on October 2, 2006.

A plebiscite was held on December 10, where the cityhood was eventually ratified and the proclamation was made in the evening. It was noted that compared to the first plebiscite, the second showed that only more than a hundred voters were added to those in favor of the conversion, as well as a sharp decline in the number of those who were against.

With the ratification, Meycauayan became Bulacan&#x27;s third component city, following San Jose del Monte in 2000, and Malolos, whose loss in its cityhood bid in 1999 was reversed following a recount.

=== Contemporary ===
Today, the city of Meycauayan has transformed into a major economic and industrial hub in the Province of Bulacan and the rest of Region III.

== Geography ==
The City of Meycauayan is generally surrounded with plain land and gentle rolling hills. Meycauayan is named to Filipino phrase &quot;may kawayan&quot; that means &quot;with bamboo&quot;.

== Issues and controversies ==

=== Mayoralty dispute (1995–2008) ===
The succession of the city&#x27;s administration was put into question by a series of legal cases between two then-Mayors. Florentino Blanco, town mayor from 1987 to 1992, ran in 1995 but was disqualified by the Supreme Court for vote buying on July 21, 1997. Blanco was replaced by Vice Mayor Eduardo Nolasco in an acting capacity, serving out the remainder of his term.

Blanco ran again in 1998 but lost to Eduardo Alarilla; Blanco attempted to file an election protest against Alarilla but the COMELEC dismissed the case. He attempted to run again in 2004 but later withdrew his candidacy. In 2007, he ran once more but lost to Eduardo Alarilla&#x27;s wife, Joan Alarilla (Mr. Alarilla has then reached the three-term limit imposed by law). The then Mayor Alarilla then attempted to disqualify Blanco; the COMELEC ruled in favor of Alarilla, but the Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that Blanco is still eligible to run for public office.

=== Heirs of Anacleto Nieto vs. Meycauayan, Bulacan ===
On December 13, 2007, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ordered Meycauayan, Bulacan to surrender peaceful possession to the Heirs of Anacleto Nieto, and vacate the 3,882 square meters lot, at Poblacion, Meycauayan, TCT No. T-24.055 (M) which it used and even constructed an extension of the public market therein. Meycauayan was also ordered to pay the reasonable value of the property and P 1,716,000.00 as reasonable compensation for the use of the property from 1966 until the filing of the complaint on December 28, 1994.

=== Pollution ===
In 2007, The Meycauayan and the neighboring town of Marilao in Bulacan province shared a slot in the list of the world&#x27;s 30 most polluted places in the developing world drawn up by the private New York-based institute Pure Earth. In its report, &quot;The World’s Worst Polluted Places&quot; for 2007, Pure Earth said: &quot;Industrial waste is haphazardly dumped into the Meycauayan, Marilao and Obando River system, a source of drinking and agricultural water supplies for the 250,000 people living in and around&quot; the Meycauayan-Marilao area. Meycauayan also shares border with Caloocan.

<text>Barry Windsor-Smith (born Barry Smith, 25 May 1949) is a British comic book illustrator and painter whose best-known work has been produced in the United States. He attained note working on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; from 1970 to 1973, and for his work on the character Wolverine, particularly the 1991 &quot;Weapon X&quot; story arc. His other noted Marvel work included a 1984 &quot;Thing&quot; story in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot;, the &quot;Lifedeath&quot; and &quot;Lifedeath II&quot; stories with writer Chris Claremont that focused on the de-powered Storm in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, as well as the 1984 &quot;Machine Man&quot; limited series with Herb Trimpe and Tom DeFalco.

After leaving Marvel, Windsor-Smith became the creative director and lead artist at Valiant Comics, where he illustrated the company&#x27;s revival of the 1960s Gold Key Comics character Solar, and created the original characters Archer and Armstrong. He was also the chief designer of the &quot;Unity&quot; crossover storyline. After leaving Valiant in 1993, Windsor-Smith did work through a number of publishers, including co-creating the vampiric character Rune with Chris Ulm, which was published as part of Malibu Comics&#x27; Ultraverse. Rune&#x27;s adventures included a crossover with Conan that Windsor-Smith wrote and illustrated. He also provided art for the WildStorm Productions/Image Comics storyline &quot;Wildstorm Rising&quot;, though he later came to regret that work. He subsequently created an oversized anthology series, &quot;Barry Windsor-Smith: Storyteller&quot; through Dark Horse Comics, though it was cancelled after nine issues.

Windsor-Smith released his subsequent work through Fantagraphics, including the &quot;Storyteller&quot; spin-off &quot;Adastra in Africa&quot;, which had originally been conceived as a &quot;Lifedeath III&quot; story for Storm; two volumes of the retrospective hardcover art book &quot;Opus&quot;; and &quot;Monsters&quot;, a 360-page hardcover published in 2021 that had originally been conceived in the mid-1980s as a &quot;Hulk&quot; story. In 2022, Barry Windsor-Smith won Eisner Awards for Best Graphic Novel, Best Letterer, and Best Writer/Artist for &quot;Monsters&quot;.

==Early life==
Barry Windsor-Smith was born Barry Smith on 25 May 1949 in Forest Gate, East End of London. He displayed artistic abilities at an early age and practiced drawing by copying Wally Wood artwork in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine and the works of Leonardo da Vinci, with little regard for what was or wasn&#x27;t considered fine art. His parents supported him in following an arts education and he attended East Ham Technical College for three years, earning degrees in Industrial Design and Illustration.

==Career==
Windsor-Smith produced his first published work in 1967 and 1968 – single page &quot;Powerhouse Pinups&quot; of Marvel Comics characters for &quot;Terrific&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; comics, titles published by Odhams Press that included licensed Marvel Comics reprints for the UK market. Following this, he flew to the U.S. in summer 1968 with fellow artist Steve Parkhouse for meetings at Marvel in New York. &quot;I sent material first, and based solely upon a pleasant return note from Stan [Lee]&#x27;s assistant Linda Fite, my pal and me were at Marvel&#x27;s doorstep in the blink of an eye.&quot; Largely due to his Jack Kirbyesque style, Marvel Comics Editor Stan Lee gave him the job of drawing both the cover and story of &quot;X-Men&quot; No. 53 (cover-dated Feb. 1969), credited to Barry Smith as he was then known. He drew Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot; #50–52 (March–May 1969), a Western short story, &quot;Half Breed&quot; (probably the story &quot;Outcast&quot; eventually published in &quot;Western Gunfighters&quot; No. 4, Feb. 1971), and issue #12 of &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (May 1969), both scripted by Parkhouse. Windsor-Smith later called his early art &quot;amateur and klutzy&quot; and a &quot;less than skillful&quot; Kirby imitation, but Stan Lee liked it enough to give him more work.

Despite this, Roy Thomas assigned him issues No. 66 and No. 67 of &quot;The Avengers&quot; (July–Aug. 1969) after he had returned to the UK. These stories introduced the fictitious indestructible metal alloy adamantium. He continued to work at a distance for Marvel, providing the art for a number of stories in the horror anthology titles &quot;Tower of Shadows&quot; and &quot;Chamber of Darkness&quot;. Thomas, a long-time fan of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s 1930 pulp-fiction character Conan the Barbarian, had Windsor-Smith provide art for a sword and sorcery story, &quot;Starr the Slayer&quot;, in &quot;Chamber of Darkness&quot; No. 4 (April 1970). Soon afterwards, Thomas offered Windsor-Smith the job as penciller for Marvel&#x27;s adaptation of Conan, starting with &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; No. 1 (Oct. 1970). In 1971, Windsor-Smith moved to the United States, having been granted a work permit. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Windsor-Smith&#x27;s &quot;initial efforts were slightly sketchy, but his technique progressed by leaps and bounds. Within a few months he had achieved a style never seen in comics before.&quot;

During his run on &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, Windsor-Smith was involved in the writing as well. He and writer Roy Thomas adapted a number of R.E. Howard short stories, the aforementioned &quot;The Frost-Giant&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;Tower of the Elephant&quot;, &quot;Rogues in the House&quot;, and &quot;Red Nails&quot;. As well as the art and story contributions, Windsor-Smith provided the covers for most issues. They worked on original adventures and characters based on R.E. Howard&#x27;s characters – most notably the flame-haired warrior-woman, Red Sonja – loosely based on a character from one of Howard&#x27;s non-Conan stories, who has now become a major comics character in her own right – in &quot;The Song of Red Sonja&quot; in &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; No. 24 (March 1973), Windsor-Smith&#x27;s last issue of the title. By then he had worked on 21 of the first 24 issues of the series, missing only issues No. 17 and No. 18, and No. 22 (which was a reprint of issue #1), and both he and the title had won a number of awards. Windsor-Smith would later say that the reason he missed those issues was because he had quit the series a number of times as he was dissatisfied with the work and how the comics business worked, rather than the deadline problems Marvel quoted. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Thomas and Windsor-Smith&#x27;s work on &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; seventh on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;.

Windsor-Smith provided the art for a number of other Marvel Comics titles, including the Ka-Zar stories in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #3–6 (December 1970 – June 1971) and No. 10 (February 1972), three further issues of &quot;The Avengers&quot; (#98–100, April–June 1972) – about which he would later remember the nightmare of drawing &quot;all those bloody characters that I didn&#x27;t give tuppence about&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot; No. 47 (June 1972), and &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #3–4 (July–September 1972), which featured Doctor Strange, both of which were apparently re-scripted by Stan Lee after being drawn to Lee&#x27;s original scripts. Windsor-Smith was by now becoming disillusioned with the comics industry and the way in which in his opinion the writers and artists were being exploited: &quot;I needed to be free of constraints and policies that were imposed by the dictates of creating entertainment for children&quot; Shortly thereafter, Windsor-Smith left comics for the first time, leaving only a couple of inventory items in the Marvel Comics vaults, both stories of R.E. Howard characters: Kull in &quot;Exile of Atlantis&quot; (&quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot; No. 3, December 1974), and Bran Mak Morn in &quot;Worms of the Earth&quot; (&quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot; No. 16, November 1975). Other than ten pages of inking of Jack Kirby pencil work for &quot;Captain America&#x27;s Bicentennial Battles&quot; (1976), a one-off oversize Marvel Treasury Edition, he produced no more comics work until 1983.

At this point he changed his professional surname to Windsor-Smith, adding his mother&#x27;s surname to his own, and began to pursue a career in fine art. Granted residential status in the United States in 1974, Windsor-Smith, along with his partner Linda Lessman, set up Gorblimey Press, through which he released a small number of limited-edition prints of fantasy-based subjects that proved popular. In 1976 Windsor-Smith published &quot;The Gorblimey Press Catalogue&quot;, a high quality index to the work published by Gorblimey Press, with full-page reproductions of each piece. Prior to that, in 1975, together with Jeff Jones, Michael Kaluta, and Bernie Wrightson, he was one of four comic book artists-turned-fine-illustrator/painters who formed a small artist&#x27;s loft commune in Manhattan known as The Studio, with the aim of pursuing creative products outside the constraints of comic book commercialism. By 1979 they had produced enough material to issue an art book under the name &quot;The Studio&quot;, which was published by Dragon&#x27;s Dream.

===1980s===
Smith designed and drew the fictitious comic strip &quot;Mandro&quot; for the 1981 Oliver Stone horror film &quot;The Hand&quot;. In the film, the artwork is used as that of character Jon Lansdale, a comic book illustrator played by Michael Caine. Stone explains the hiring of Smith thus:

I&#x27;d always been a fan of his. I think I fell in love with his version of Conan before I had even read the Howard books. He did more for that comic than anyone…Since the cartoonist was drawing a Conan-type character, Barry was the logical choice. Oddly enough, Barry was English, as was Michael, and they both have sandy blond hair. When they first met, they discovered that they&#x27;re both about 6&#x27; 2&quot;, and that they both have the same sort of East End wit. The similarity was quite amazing.

Windsor-Smith returned to mainstream comics work for Marvel in 1983 with two pieces, a short mystical tale of love, &quot;The Beguiling&quot;, and a dark, humorous two-page black-and-white story, &quot;A Path of Stars&quot;, both in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; No. 16 (February 1983), which featured a page-and-a-half Windsor-Smith spread accompanying an Archie Goodwin text story called &quot;The Horde&quot; (which appears to be a drawing of Conan and Valeria in battle). Later the same year he produced a short piece in Dave Sim&#x27;s &quot;Swords of Cerebus&quot; (#5, 1983), followed in 1984 by several Marvel superhero stories: an untitled story, though usually referred to as &quot;that night...&quot;, and an April Fool&#x27;s story of The Thing in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; No. 15 (July 1984), which he wrote and drew. He illustrated &quot;Lifedeath&quot; a double-sized Storm story in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; No. 186 (October 1984), and a four-issue &quot;Machine Man&quot; limited series (October 1984 – January 1985), for which Windsor-Smith was artist and colorist over Herb Trimpe layouts for the first three issues, and drew and colored alone for the fourth. Although he would return to the X-Men once a year for the next three years, (&quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; No. 198, #205 and #214), his mainstream comics output remained limited throughout the rest of the 1980s, amounting to just one issue each of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (#296, November 1986) and &quot;Daredevil&quot; (#236, November 1986), two issues of &quot;Iron Man&quot; (#232, July 1988 and No. 243, June 1989), two pages for DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Heroes Against Hunger&quot; benefit project, and two small pieces for the Harvey Award-winning comics anthology &quot;A1&quot; published by Atomeka Press. In 1987 he returned to his first major success and provided new painted covers for nine issues of Marvel&#x27;s Conan reprint title &quot;The Conan Saga&quot;, all issues which contained black-and-white reprints of his original 1970s stories.

===1990s===
Together with the X-Men spin-off &quot;Excalibur&quot; (#27, September 1990), Windsor-Smith&#x27;s last work for Marvel Comics came with the serialized &quot;Weapon X&quot; feature in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #72–84 (1991), his telling of the origin of the X-Men character Wolverine which he wrote, drew, inked, colored, and co-lettered. In late 1991, he was approached by Valiant Comics, a new comics publisher founded by former Marvel Comics writer and editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, and asked to act as their creative director and lead artist. Valiant had obtained a number of characters originally published in the 1960s and 1970s by Gold Key Comics: Magnus Robot Fighter, Doctor Solar and Turok Dinosaur Hunter, and added their own original titles to the roster, including &quot;Harbinger&quot;, &quot;X-O Manowar&quot;, &quot;Shadowman&quot;, &quot;Archer and Armstrong&quot;, &quot;Eternal Warrior&quot;, &quot;Bloodshot&quot;, &quot;Ninjak&quot;, and &quot;Rai&quot;.

Windsor-Smith was the chief designer of the &quot;Unity&quot; crossover storyline for Valiant Comics, and writer and artist for most of the first dozen issues of the title &quot;Archer and Armstrong&quot;. By focusing on storytelling and innovative marketing practices such as a tightly knit continuity, crossovers and send away issues Valiant quickly became a considerable success story, selling nearly two million copies of premiere issues and rapidly becoming the third largest comic book publisher in the U.S., after Marvel and DC Comics. However, in 1993 Windsor-Smith once again found himself in opposition to company employment policies when Valiant decided to adopt the same work for hire practices that he had disliked in Marvel Comics, and became dissatisfied with his position in the company: &quot;They needed me as a figurehead just as much as a creator.&quot; He left Valiant soon after Jim Shooter&#x27;s departure from the company. Smith has called work-for-hire contracts &quot;a legal but unethical instrument designed to rape and plunder young talents of every possible prerogative they would otherwise possess if they had the fortune to work for more scrupulous, morally invested, publishers.&quot;

Of his work for Valiant, and the problems he encountered there over legal ownership of titles and characters, Windsor-Smith said in 2008, &quot;In the 1970s I was constantly asked when I would &#x27;do Conan again&#x27;. In these latter years I receive e-mails imploring me to return to &quot;Archer and Armstrong&quot;. My short reply is, &#x27;When pigs fly to the Moon and return home safely.

Since leaving Valiant, Windsor-Smith has worked for a number of companies. For Malibu&#x27;s Ultraverse line he co-created Rune with Chris Ulm, including a crossover one-shot comic titled &quot;Conan vs. Rune&quot; published by Marvel Comics in 1994 after they took over Malibu. As a result he once again came up against legal ownership problems, and the &quot;Rune&quot; stories have remained un-reprinted as a result. For Image Comics he worked on the crossover storyline &quot;Wildstorm Rising&quot;, drawing and coloring &quot;Wildstorm Rising&quot; No. 1 (May 1995), and all eleven of the covers for the interlinked series. Windsor-Smith later said that he was talked into illustrating &quot;Wildstorm Rising&quot;, and regretted participating in it, stating that in reading the story and illustrating it, he could not understand the motivations of any of the characters, even when he read earlier Wildstorm books featuring the characters. He says he altered the plot in an attempt to improve it and his enthusiasm for it, later learning that writer James Robinson was not pleased with his doing so.

In 1995 Windsor-Smith created an oversized anthology series, &quot;Barry Windsor-Smith: Storyteller&quot; for Dark Horse Comics that contained three ongoing features: &quot;The Paradoxman&quot;, a dark science-fiction tale, &quot;Young GODS&quot;, a homage to Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;Thor&quot; and &quot;New Gods&quot; series, and &quot;The Freebooters&quot;, a lighthearted action series about an ageing Conan-like character grown older and heavier and now running a tavern. He cancelled &quot;Storyteller&quot; after nine issues, even though a tenth issue had been completed; since then Fantagraphics Books has issued hardcover collections of &quot;Young GODS&quot; and &quot;The Freebooters&quot;. Each of these hardcover volumes includes supplemental features, essays and previously unseen art. Fantagraphics has published Windsor-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Adastra in Africa&quot;, a hardcover starring a character from &quot;Young GODS&quot; in a story originally intended to be published as &quot;Lifedeath III&quot; for Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot;, with the character &quot;Storm&quot;. In 1999 Fantagraphics published two volumes of &quot;BWS – Opus&quot;, a hardcover art books featuring Windsor-Smith&#x27;s work from throughout his career, including an autobiographical story, &quot;Time Rise&quot;, which features details of his experiences with seemingly paranormal phenomena. He was working on a Superman story in 1999 that has not yet seen print.

===2000s===
Windsor-Smith created a story called &quot;UFO POV,&quot; an 11-page story in &quot;Streetwise&quot; (July 2000), a trade paperback anthology published by TwoMorrows Publishing. In 2000 and 2001 he also produced cover art for a number of Marvel titles including Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;New X-Men&quot;, and drew five pages of &quot;Wolverine&quot; #166 (Sept. 2001), a &quot;Weapon X&quot; tie-in written by Frank Tieri. In January 2004, Fantagraphics Books published Windsor-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Young Gods and Friends&quot;, a hardcover collecting material from &quot;Barry Windsor-Smith: Storyteller&quot; along with new material. November 2005 saw a follow-up hardcover titled &quot;The Freebooters&quot;, again collecting material from &quot;Storyteller&quot; with new material. A planned third and final volume, collecting &quot;The Paradoxman&quot; serial, has not yet been released. In January 2006, Windsor-Smith announced on the website Comic Book Galaxy that he was in negotiations to publish a graphic novel for Marvel Comics starring The Thing.

===2020s===
Windsor-Smith&#x27;s next work was &quot;Monsters&quot;, a 366-page graphic novel that began life as a 23-page &quot;Hulk&quot; story in 1984 or 1985, and was released on 27 April 2021 by Fantagraphics, Windsor-Smith&#x27;s first book in 16 years. Windsor-Smith describes the book as one that &quot;explores the life and times of two disparate American families fatefully connected by an abandoned Nazi project in genetic engineering that has been covertly revived by the US government&quot;. Windsor-Smith wrote, drew, inked, and lettered the entire graphic novel, which Sam Leith, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said was &quot;a rare niche&quot; that Windsor-Smith had carved out for himself as an auteur. The book won the 2022 Eisner Awards for Best Graphic Novel, Best Writer/Artist, and Best Lettering.

==Artistic style==
Windsor-Smith&#x27;s work at Marvel during the 1960s was reminiscent of Jack Kirby, with characters making dynamic poses. During his time on &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, Windsor-Smith developed an art style preferring Romantic illustration over sequential storytelling that had influences from fine artists such as Howard Pyle and Andrew Wyeth. Windsor-Smith has been credited with introducing Romantic art to American comics, although he has said this wasn&#x27;t an intentional decision so much as a way to bring something new to comic book art at the time. He has also claimed to be an uncredited co-writer on the majority of his comics work.

==Personal life==
As of 2021, Windsor-Smith was living in the United States, which had been his home since 1971.

<doc id="626506" wikidata="Q6913637" url="?curid=626506" title="Morris Canal">
<text>The Morris Canal (1829–1924) was a common carrier anthracite coal canal across northern New Jersey that connected the two industrial canals in Easton, Pennsylvania across the Delaware River from its western terminus at Phillipsburg, New Jersey to New York Harbor and New York City through its eastern terminals in Newark and on the Hudson River in Jersey City. The canal was sometimes called the Morris and Essex Canal, in error, due to confusion with the nearby and unrelated Morris and Essex Railroad.

With a total elevation change of more than , the canal was considered an ingenious technological marvel for its use of water-driven inclined planes, the first in the United States, to cross the northern New Jersey hills.

It was built primarily to move coal to industrializing eastern cities that had stripped their environs of wood. Completed to Newark in 1831, the canal was extended eastward to Jersey City between 1834 and 1836. In 1839, hot blast technology was married to blast furnaces fired entirely using anthracite, allowing the continuous high-volume production of plentiful anthracite pig iron. 
The Morris Canal eased the transportation of anthracite from Pennsylvania&#x27;s Lehigh Valley to northern New Jersey&#x27;s growing iron industry and other developing industries adopting steam power in New Jersey and the New York City area. It also carried minerals and iron ore westward to blast furnaces in western New Jersey and Allentown and Bethlehem in the Lehigh Valley until the development of Great Lakes iron ore caused the trade to decline.

The Morris Canal remained in heavy use through the 1860s. But railroads had begun to eclipse canals in the United States, and in 1871, it was leased to the Lehigh Valley Railroad.

Like many enterprises that depended on anthracite, the canal&#x27;s revenues dried up with the rise of oil fuels and truck transport. It was taken over by the state of New Jersey in 1922, and formally abandoned in 1924.

While the canal was largely dismantled in the following five years, portions of it and its accompanying feeders and ponds have been preserved. A statewide greenway for cyclists and pedestrians is planned, beginning in Phillipsburg, traversing Warren, Sussex, Morris, Passaic, Essex, and Hudson Counties and including the old route through Jersey City. The canal was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 1, 1974, for its significance in engineering, industry, and transportation. The boundary was increased in 2016 to include the Lake Hopatcong station in Landing.

==Description==
On the canal&#x27;s western end, at Phillipsburg, a cable ferry allowed Morris Canal boats to cross the Delaware River westward to Easton, Pennsylvania, and travel up the Lehigh Canal to Mauch Chunk, in the anthracite coal regions, to receive their cargoes from the mines. From Phillipsburg, the Morris Canal ran eastward through the valley of the Musconetcong River, which it roughly paralleled upstream to its source at Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey&#x27;s largest lake. From the lake, the canal descended through the valley of the Rockaway River to Boonton, eventually around the northern end of Paterson&#x27;s Garret Mountain, and south to its 1831 terminus at Newark on the Passaic River. From there it continued eastward across Kearny Point and through Jersey City to the Hudson River. The extension through Jersey City was at sea level and was supplied with water from the lower Hackensack River.

With its two navigable feeders, the canal was long. Its ascent eastward from Phillipsburg to its feeder from Lake Hopatcong was , and the descent from there to tidewater was . Surmounting the height difference was considered a major engineering feat of its day, accomplished through 23 locks and 23 inclined planes — essentially, short railways that carried canal boats in open cars uphill and downhill using water-powered winches. Inclined planes required less time and water than locks, although they were more expensive to build and maintain.

==History==

The idea for constructing the canal is credited to Morristown businessman George P. MacCulloch, who reportedly conceived the idea while visiting Lake Hopatcong. In 1822, MacCulloch brought together a group of interested citizens at Morristown to discuss the idea.

The &quot;Palladium of Liberty&quot;, a Morristown newspaper of the day, reported on August 29, 1822: &quot;...Membership of a committee which studied the practicality of a canal from Pennsylvania to Newark, New Jersey, consisted of two prominent citizens from each county (NJ) concerned: Hunterdon County, Nathaniel Saxton, Henry Dusenberry; Sussex County, Morris Robinson, Gamaliel Bartlett; Morris County, Lewis Condict, Mahlon Dickerson; Essex County, Gerald Rutgers, Charles Kinsey; Bergen County, John Rutherford, William Colefax ...&quot;.

On November 15, 1822, the New Jersey Legislature passed an act appointing three commissioners, one of whom was MacCulloch, to explore the feasibility of the project, determine the canal&#x27;s possible route, and estimate its costs. MacCulloch initially greatly underestimated the height difference between the Passaic and Lake Hopatcong, pegging it at only .

On December 31, 1824, the New Jersey Legislature chartered the Morris Canal and Banking Company, a private corporation charged with the construction of the canal. The corporation issued 20,000 shares of stock at $100 a share, providing $2 million of capital, divided evenly between funds for building the canal and funds for banking privileges. The charter provided that New Jersey could take over the canal at the end of 99 years. In the event that the state did not take over the canal, the charter would remain in effect for 50 years more, after which the canal would become the property of the state without cost.

===Construction===
In 1823, the canal company hired Ephraim Beach, who was originally an assistant engineer on the Erie Canal, as its chief engineer, to survey the routes for the Morris Canal.
Construction started in 1824 in Newark, with a channel wide and deep. The canal started from Upper Newark Bay, followed the Passaic River and crossed it at Little Falls, then went on to Boonton, Dover, then the southern tip of Lake Hopatcong, whereupon it went to Phillipsburg.

On October 15, 1825, ground was broken at the summit level at the &quot;Great Pond&quot; (i.e. lake Hopatcong). By 1828, 82 of the 97 eastern sections and 43 of the 74 western sections were finished. By 1829, some sections were completed and opened for traffic, and in 1830, the section from Newark to Rockaway was opened.

Because the locks could only handle boats of , that meant that through traffic from the Lehigh Canal was impossible, requiring reloading coal at Easton.

====Design and building of the inclined planes====


The vertical movement on the Morris Canal was , in comparison with less than on the Erie Canal, and would have required a lock every , which would have made the costs prohibitive. 
James Renwick, a professor at Columbia University, devised the idea of using inclined planes to raise the boats in , instead of using about 300 lift locks, since a lift lock of that time typically lifted about . In the end, Renwick used only 23 inclined planes and 23 locks. Lock dimensions were originally wide and long

Renwick&#x27;s original design seems to have been to have double tracks on all inclined planes, with the descending caisson holding more water; thus, the system theoretically would not have needed external power. Nevertheless, the inclined planes were built with overshot water wheels to supply power.

The early planes were done by different contractors and differed greatly. In 1829, the canal company hired David Bates Douglass from West Point, who became the chief engineer of the planes. He supervised the construction of the remaining planes to be built and also altered the already built planes.

The inclined planes had a set of tracks, gauge about , running from the lower level up the incline, over the crest of the hill at the top, and down into the next level. Tracks were submerged at both ends. A large cradle, holding the boat, ran on the tracks. Iron overshot waterwheels originally powered the planes.

The Scotch (reaction) turbines, which later replaced the overshot water wheels, were feet in diameter and made of cast iron. They could pull boats up an 11% grade. The longest plane was the double-tracked Plane 9 West, which was long and lifted boats up (i.e. 6% grade) in 12 minutes. The total weight of the boat, cargo, and cradle was about .

The Scotch turbines produced (for example, on Plane 2 West) 235 horsepower using a head of water and had a discharge rate of per minute. Some turbines were also reported to develop 704 horsepower. The winding drum was in diameter and had a spiral grove of pitch. The rope was fastened on both ends to the drum, and there was a clutch that allowed the direction of the wheel to be reversed. The plane had two lines of steel rails, with a gauge of from center of rail to center. Rails were wide at top and high, and weighed . The cradle had a brake, in case the load went downhill too fast. Descent was also checked by the plane-man by putting about half power through the turbine. The water was fed into the turbines from below, thus relieving friction on the bearings and balancing them.

A comparison of Plane 2 West (Stanhope), which had a lift, with a flight of 12 locks yields the following: the plane took 5 minutes 30 seconds, and consumed of water lifting a loaded boat. Locks , meaning of water per lock) would consume for 12 locks (about 23 times more water) and would take 96 minutes.

The Elbląg Canal, one of Seven Wonders of Poland, used the Morris Canal&#x27;s technology as inspiration for its inclined planes; for that reason, the inclined planes on that canal strongly resemble those on the Morris Canal.

The Newark Eagle reported in 1830:

The machinery was set in motion under the direction of Major Douglass, the enterprising Engineer. The boat, with two hundred persons on board, rose majestically out of the water; in one minute it was upon the summit, which it passed apparently with all the ease that a ship would cross a wave of the sea. As the forward wheels of the car commenced their descent, the boat seemed gently to bow to the spectators and the town below, then glided quickly down the wooden way. In six minutes and thirty seconds it descended from the summit and re-entered the canal, thus passing a plane one thousand and forty feet long, with a descent of seventy feet, in six and one half minutes.
An English visitor, Fanny Trollope, in her 1832 book &quot;Domestic Manners of the Americans&quot;, wrote of the canal:

We spent a delightful day in New Jersey, in visiting, with a most agreeable party, the inclined planes, which are used instead of locks on the Morris canal.

This is a very interesting work; it is one among a thousand which prove the people of America to be the most enterprising in the world. I was informed that this important canal, which connects the waters of the Hudson and the Delaware, is a hundred miles long, and in this distance overcomes a variation of level amounting to sixteen hundred feet. Of this, fourteen hundred are achieved by inclined planes. The planes average about sixty feet of perpendicular lift each, and are to support about forty tons. The time consumed in passing them is twelve minutes for one hundred feet of perpendicular rise. The expense is less than a third of what locks would be for surmounting the same rise. If we set about any more canals, this may be worth attending to.

This Morris canal is certainly an extraordinary work; it not only varies its level sixteen hundred feet, but at one point runs along the side of a mountain at thirty feet above the tops of the highest buildings in the town of Paterson, below; at another it crosses the falls of the Passaic in a stone aqueduct sixty feet above the water in the river. This noble work, in a great degree, owes its existence to the patriotic and scientific energy of Mr. Cadwallader Colden.

=====Orange Street Inclined Plane=====
In 1902, after a fatal crash between a Delaware and Lackawanna railroad train and a streetcar, the railroad grade was lowered (to the level it occupies today) and the Morris Canal had to make an electrically driven incline plane to bring boats up and over the railroad and Orange street, and then back down into the canal, with a pipe to carry the water across the break.

====Aqueducts====

Several aqueducts were built for the canal: the Little Falls Aqueduct over the Passaic River in Paterson, New Jersey, and the Pompton River Aqueduct, as well as aqueducts over the Second and Third river

The longest level was , from Bloomfield to Lincoln Park; the second-longest, from Port Murray to Saxon Falls.

The aqueduct over the Pohatcong Creek at the base of Inclined Plane 7 West is now used as a road bridge on Plane Hill Road in Bowerstown.

====Opening of the canal====
On November 1, 1830, before the whole canal was finished, the eastern side of the canal between Dover and Newark was tested with several boats loaded with iron ore and iron. These went through the planes without incident. On May 20, 1832, the canal was officially opened. The first boat passing entirely through the canal was the &quot;Walk-on-Water&quot;, followed by two coal-laden boats went from Phillipsburg all the way to Newark. This initial section (not counting the Jersey City portion, which was done later) ran and cost $2,104,413 ().

===Operating years===

Soon after opening, it became apparent that the canal had to be widened and had to be extended across to the New York Bay across Bayonne. Early boats, called &quot;flickers,&quot; could only carry 18 tons. By 1840 the company had finished enlarging the locks, canal, and planes, and finished building the extension to Jersey City. Boats were divided in two, hitched with a pin, as were the trucks (cradles) on the inclined planes. The enlarged locks&#x27; dimensions were now wide and long.

The original company failed in 1841 amid banking scandals, and the canal was leased to private bidders for three years. The canal company was reorganized in 1844, with a capitalization of $1 million. The canal bed was inspected, and improvements were made. First, the places where seepage occurred were lined with clay, and two feeders were dug, to Lake Hopatcong and to Pompton. The inclined planes were rebuilt with wire cabling. Banking privileges were removed in 1849, leaving the company as a canal-operating business only.

By 1860, the canal had been progressively enlarged to accommodate boats of . Traffic reached a peak in 1866, when the canal carried of freight (equivalent to nearly 13,000 boatloads). Between 1848 and 1860, the original overshot water wheels that powered the inclined planes were replaced with more powerful water turbines. The locks and inclines planes were also renumbered since some had been combined or eliminated.

Boats of were now long, wide, and drew of water.

Freight figures are as follows: 
===Cargo===
The Morris canal carried coal, malleable pig iron, and iron ore. It also carried grain, wood, cider, vinegar, beer, whiskey, bricks, hay, hides, sugar, lumber, manure, lime, and ice. Although it is said that the Morris Canal was mainly a freight canal and not a passenger canal, some boats on the Morris Canal did offer &quot;Cool summer rides accompanied by a shipment of ice&quot;. Additional cargo include scrap metal, zinc, sand, clay, and farm products.

Iron ore from the Ogden Mine was brought to Nolan&#x27;s Point (Lake Hopatcong). In 1880 the canal transported 1,700 boatloads (about ) of iron ore. Thereafter, competition from taconite ore in the Lake Superior region brought a decline in New Jersey bog iron.

===Working hours===
The plane tender of Plane 11 East reported that during the operating days, boats would tie up at night up to a mile above the plane, down another mile to Lock 15 East (Lock 14 East in the old 1836 numbering), and then about a mile below Lock 14 East. They would start putting boats through starting around 4 a.m. (dawn), and go all day long until 10 p.m., often handling boatmen who had gone through that morning, unloaded in Newark, and were returning.

===Decline===

The canal&#x27;s profitability was undermined by railroads, which could deliver in five hours cargo that took four days by boat.

In 1871, the canal was leased by the Lehigh Valley Railroad, which sought the valuable terminal properties at Phillipsburg and Jersey City. The railroad never realized a profit from the operation of the canal.

By the early 20th century, commercial traffic on the canal had become negligible. Two committees, in 1903 and 1912, recommended abandoning the canal. The 1912 survey wrote, &quot;...from Jersey City to Paterson, [the canal] was little more than an open sewer ... but its value beyond Paterson was of great importance, no longer as a freight transit line but as a parkway.&quot; Many of the existing photographs of the working canal were shot as part of these surveys, as well as by other people who wanted photographs of the canal before its demise.

In 1918, the canal company filed a lawsuit to block the construction of the Wanaque Reservoir in Passic County, asserting that the reservoir would divert water needed for the Pompton feeder. The company won the suit in 1922, but the victory was Pyrrhic; the canal was now viewed as an impediment to the development of the area&#x27;s water supply. On March 1, 1923, the state of New Jersey took possession of the canal; it shut it down the following year. Over the next five years, the state largely dismantled the canal: the water was drained out, banks were cut, and canal works destroyed, including needlessly dynamiting the Little Falls aqueduct.

The Newark City Subway, now Newark Light Rail, was built along its route.

==Canal today==
The Morris Canal Historic District was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places in 1973 and to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The canal was listed as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1980.

Portions of the canal are preserved. Waterloo Village, a restored canal town in Sussex County, has the remains of an inclined plane, a guard lock, a watered section of the canal, a canal store, and other period buildings. The Canal Society of New Jersey maintains a museum in the village.

Other remnants and artifacts of the canal can be seen along its former course. On the South Kearny, New Jersey, peninsula, where the canal ran just south of and parallel to the Lincoln Highway, now U.S. Route 1/9 Truck, the cross-highway bridges for Central Avenue and the rail spur immediately to its east were built to span the highway and the canal.

The inlet where the canal connected to the Hudson River is now the north edge of Liberty State Park, and the right-of-way of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail follows the canal for part of its length.

===Morris Canal Greenway===
The North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority is developing the Morris Canal Greenway, a group of passive recreation parks and preserves along parts of the former canal route.

Parks along the greenway include:

* Peckman Preserve
* Pompton Aquatic Park
* Wayne Township Riverside Park
* Walking path in Lincoln Park

<text>Revés/Yo Soy (English: Backwards/I Am) is the fourth album by the Mexican rock band Café Tacuba, released in 1999. In fact, it is two albums—&quot;Revés&quot; is an instrumental album, &quot;Yo Soy&quot; a collection of songs the band had been saving up since their second album, &quot;Re&quot;. 

It was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the &quot;Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance&quot; category. It won the Latin Grammy Award for &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Many of the Spanish lyrics are about isolation and disorientation: as most great bands do three or four albums into a career, Cafe Tacuba has made a record about entering one&#x27;s 30s and wondering what the next step is.&quot;

In a retrospective article, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the album a &quot;masterpiece,&quot; writing that it &quot;matched offbeat Eno-meets-Esquivel instrumentals with slightly more conventional rock songs.&quot;

==Track listing==


==Personnel==
* Ñru/Amparo Tonto Medardo In Lak&#x27; ech (Rubén Albarrán) – vocals (except 4, 7, 12, 15), guitar

<text>Michael Martin Murphey (born March 14, 1945) is an American singer-songwriter. He was one of the founding artists of progressive country. A multiple Grammy nominee, Murphey has six gold albums, including &quot;Cowboy Songs&quot;, the first album of cowboy music to achieve gold status since &quot;Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs&quot; by Marty Robbins in 1959. He has recorded the hit singles &quot;Wildfire&quot;, &quot;Carolina in the Pines&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Forever For&quot;, &quot;A Long Line of Love&quot;, &quot;What She Wants&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Count the Rainy Days&quot;, and &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;. Murphey is also the author of New Mexico&#x27;s state ballad, &quot;The Land of Enchantment&quot;. Murphey has become a prominent musical voice for the Western horseman, rancher, and cowboy.

==Early life==
Michael Martin Murphey was born on March 14, 1945, to Pink Lavary Murphey and Lois (née Corbett) Murphey, in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, Texas, where he grew up. He has a brother, Mark, who is three years younger. When he was 6 years old, he started riding horses on his grandfather&#x27;s and uncle&#x27;s ranches. Years later he would remember sleeping on his grandfather&#x27;s porch under the stars, listening to the older man&#x27;s stories and cowboy songs.

He enjoyed being around these men of the land as they went about their work. These experiences made a deep impression on the young boy. During these early years, he developed a special love for cowboy songs and stories. He was also an avid reader, especially drawn to the books of Mark Twain and William Faulkner. As a youth, he enjoyed writing poetry and loved listening to his uncle&#x27;s old 78 rpm records, particularly the music of country and folk artists such as Hank Williams, Bob Wills, and Woody Guthrie.

In junior high school he began performing as an amateur, and later as a camp counselor at a summer camp called Sky Ranch. At the age of 17, he took his first &quot;professional&quot; music job, playing western songs around a campfire at a Texas ranch. By the early 1960s, Murphey was playing the clubs in Dallas, performing country music, folk music, and rock music. He won over Texas audiences with his charm and talent, and soon formed a band that developed a significant following in the Dallas area.

==Songwriting success==

After graduating from W. H. Adamson High School in Oak Cliff, Murphey studied Greek at the University of North Texas. As a member of the institution&#x27;s Folk Music Club, he befriended Steven Fromholz, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Shiva&#x27;s Headband fiddler Spencer Perskin and Armadillo World Headquarters co-founder Eddie Wilson. Murphey then moved to California, where he studied creative writing and majored in medieval history and literature at the University of California, Los Angeles. He signed a publishing contract with the Sparrow Music company, and soon he made a name for himself in the Los Angeles folk music scene. By 1964, he formed a musical group with an old Texas friend, Michael Nesmith, John London, and John Raines, under the name the Trinity River Boys.

Murphey&#x27;s first big break came through his friend Michael Nesmith, who had become part of the popular television musical group, The Monkees. Nesmith asked Murphey to write them a song for the next Monkees album, and with Owens Castleman, Murphey composed &quot;What Am I Doing Hangin&#x27; Round&quot; (under the pseudonyms Travis Lewis and Boomer Clarke). The album &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot; sold over five million copies.

Murphey and Castleman formed The Lewis &amp; Clarke Expedition, and recorded one self-titled album for Colgems Records, the company that also released the Monkees&#x27; LPs. They had a modest hit with &quot;I Feel Good (I Feel Bad)&quot;. Castleman went on to find success with his controversial song &quot;Judy Mae&quot; and as the writer and producer of the million selling novelty hit &quot;Telephone Man&quot; for singer Meri Wilson.

In 1968, Murphey moved to Wrightwood, a village in the San Gabriel Mountains adjacent to the Mojave Desert of California to work on his songwriting. Based on the success of his songs, he signed a contract with the Screen Gems company, the publishing arm of Columbia Pictures. Some of his songs were recorded by Flatt and Scruggs and Bobbie Gentry. Kenny Rogers and the First Edition recorded an entire album of Michael Murphey songs called &quot;The Ballad of Calico&quot;, about a Mojave Desert ghost town.

Murphey wrote some additional songs for The Monkees, but he grew disillusioned with the poor financial rewards and the Southern California music scene.

== Austin years ==
In 1971, Murphey returned to Texas and played a pivotal role in launching the progressive country genre with a unique sound that combined his country, rock, and folk influences. It was during this period that Murphey co-wrote &quot;Geronimo&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; with the lyricist Charles John Quarto, a song about Native American rights that later became an unofficial anthem for the American Indian Movement in the early 1970s.

In 1971, Murphey was signed to A&amp;M Records by Bob Johnston, who discovered him in a Dallas club, the Rubaiyat. Johnston had produced some of the country&#x27;s most popular recording artists, including Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and Simon and Garfunkel. In 1972, Johnston produced Murphey&#x27;s first album &quot;Geronimo&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee. The sound of the album reflects Murphey&#x27;s love of country, folk, and blues music. Murphey&#x27;s early gospel influences are also evident throughout the album. The title track was released as a single, and reached the Top 40 on the US pop charts. In addition to the title track, the album included &quot;Boy from the Country&quot;, &quot;What Am I Doin&#x27; Hangin&#x27; Around?&quot;, and &quot;Michael Angelo&#x27;s Blues&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine proclaimed, &quot;On the strength of his first album alone, Michael Murphey is the best new songwriter in the country.&quot;

In 1973, Murphey followed up with the album &quot;Cosmic Cowboy Souvenir&quot;, which continued the urban cowboy theme of the first album. The album included &quot;Cosmic Cowboy, Pt. 1&quot;, &quot;Alleys of Austin&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Hills&quot;.

Throughout this period, Murphey&#x27;s band included Bob Livingston and Gary P. Nunn, the author of &quot;London Homesick Blues&quot;. He performed a number of times at the Armadillo World Headquarters, and his photo was even used for the original cover of Jan Reid&#x27;s book, &quot;The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock&quot;. But Michael Murphey&#x27;s musical vision was expanding beyond the confines of the outlaw country sound and moving toward a much more ambitious musical tapestry.

==&quot;Wildfire&quot; and the Epic years==
In 1973, Murphey signed to Epic Records and released the album &quot;Michael Murphey&quot; that same year. Produced by Bob Johnston, the album included the orchestra anthem &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Gonna Tell Me How To Play My Music&quot;, and &quot;Southwestern Pilgrimage&quot;.

In 1975, Murphey released his seminal album, &quot;Blue Sky – Night Thunder&quot;, also produced by Bob Johnston. The album generated two hit singles: &quot;Carolina in the Pines&quot; and his Platinum-certified signature song &quot;Wildfire&quot;, a sentimental song about the ghosts of a woman and her horse. As a boy, he first heard from his grandfather the story of a ghost horse rescuing people in the desert. Years later, Murphey had a dream about this ghost horse and wrote the words and music the same day with songwriter Larry Cansler.

In the summer of 1975, &quot;Wildfire&quot; became a chart-topping hit, reaching No. 2 in Cash Box and No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, giving Murphey a new level of commercial success and exposure. It immediately sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in July 1975. It eventually surpassed two million in US sales and was awarded a platinum disc by the R.I.A.A. in September 2001. The song&#x27;s harmonies were supplied by Jeff Hanna and Jimmy Ibbotson from the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and the piano introduction and ending coda played by jazz pianist Jac Murphy. The introduction is based on a piece by the Russian classical composer Alexander Scriabin.

During the late 1970s, he recorded four albums: &quot;Swans Against the Sun&quot; (1975), &quot;Flowing Free Forever&quot; (1976), &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; (1978), and &quot;Peaks, Valleys, Honky Tonks &amp; Alleys&quot; (1979). The album &quot;Swans Against the Sun&quot; produced his first country hits: &quot;A Mansion on the Hill&quot; and &quot;Cherokee Fiddle&quot;, which became a top ten hit for Johnny Lee. Murphey&#x27;s friends, John Denver, Willie Nelson, Charlie Daniels, and Steve Weisberg appeared on the album. In 1981, Murphey made his first film appearance in &quot;Hard Country&quot;, which he co-wrote.

To distinguish himself from actor Michael Murphy, the singer began using his middle name for film and music credits. To this day, he is known as Michael Martin Murphey.

==Mainstream success==

In 1982, Murphey signed with Liberty Records and produced two original albums, &quot;Michael Martin Murphey&quot; and &quot;The Heart Never Lies&quot;, as well as a compilation of re-recorded versions of his A&amp;M, Epic, and Liberty hits called &quot;The Best of Michael Martin Murphey&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Murphey had significant commercial success with hits like &quot;Still Taking Chances&quot;, &quot;Disenchanted&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Count the Rainy Days&quot;, &quot;Will It Be Love by Morning&quot;, &quot;Radio Land&quot;, &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;, and the number one hit &quot;What&#x27;s Forever For&quot;, written by Rafe Van Hoy, which also crossed over to number three at AC Radio and number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Pop Singles Chart. In 1983, Murphey was voted Best New Male Vocalist of the Year by the Academy of Country Music. In 1985, his rerecorded version of &quot;Carolina in the Pines&quot; reached the Top 10.

In 1985, Murphey signed a new recording contract with Warner Bros. Records and continued his streak of successful recordings. In 1986, he released the album &quot;Tonight We Ride&quot;, which included &quot;Rollin&#x27; Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Fiddlin&#x27; Man&quot;, and &quot;Santa Fe Cantina&quot;. In 1987, he released the album &quot;Americana&quot;, which included &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, &quot;My Darling Wherever You Are&quot;, and another number one country hit with the song &quot;A Long Line of Love&quot;. That same album produced the hit single &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; with Holly Dunn, which was nominated for a Grammy Award.

In 1988, Murphey released the album &quot;River of Time&quot;, which produced three hit singles that reached number three on the charts: Jesse Winchester&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Miss You, Girl&quot;, his own &quot;From the Word Go&quot;, and &quot;Talkin&#x27; to the Wrong Man&quot;, which featured his son Ryan. In 1989, Murphey closed out a successful decade of recording with the album &quot;Land of Enchantment&quot;, which contained &quot;Never Givin&#x27; Up on Love&quot;, &quot;Got to Pay the Fiddler&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, and &quot;Land of Enchantment&quot;, which became New Mexico&#x27;s state ballad.

==Cowboy songs==

Despite the impressive critical and commercial success he achieved throughout the 1980s, Murphey&#x27;s authentic creativity began to gravitate towards the Western music that appealed to him as a child coming of age in Texas. As early as 1985, Murphey performed with the New Mexico Symphony in a show called &quot;A Night in the American West&quot;, which led to many subsequent performances with American and Canadian symphonies, including the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington, D.C. These western shows, and the songs he was writing and recording at the time, presaged a major change in Murphey&#x27;s career.

In 1990, he released the album &quot;Cowboy Songs&quot;. The album contained Murphey&#x27;s versions of old cowboy songs from the public domain such as &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot;, &quot;The Old Chisholm Trail&quot;, the beautiful &quot;Spanish is the Loving Tongue&quot;, the classic &quot;The Streets of Laredo&quot;, and his tip of the hat to Roy Rogers, &quot;Happy Trails&quot;. The album contained Murphey&#x27;s own &quot;Cowboy Logic&quot;.

Murphey was reluctant to promote the project, but he eventually released &quot;Cowboy Logic&quot; as a single and it quickly became a hit. Soon after, the album caught on and sold much better than expected. &quot;Cowboy Songs&quot; earned widespread praise from country and folk music critics, such as Jack Hurst from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; who wrote, &quot;[This is] not only one of the finest albums of [the] year but also one of the finest of the last decade. Its 22 riveting cuts represent a labor of not only love but also scholarship; it raises a cult musical genre to the level of mainstream art. &quot;Cowboy Songs&quot; went on to achieve Gold status, the first western album to do so since Marty Robbins&#x27; &quot;No. 1 Cowboy&quot; in 1980.

In 1991, Murphey followed up with two additional albums of cowboy songs. His innovative concept album, &quot;Cowboy Christmas: Cowboy Songs II&quot;, contained versions of traditional and original western Christmas songs, including &quot;The Christmas Trail&quot;, &quot;The Cowboy Christmas Ball&quot;, and &quot;Two-Step &#x27;Round the Christmas Tree&quot;. An accompanying video was later released of one of Murphey&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy Christmas Ball&quot; concerts, which included many of these songs. &quot;Cowboy Songs III&quot; contained a mix of traditional and original cowboy songs, including a virtual duet with Marty Robbins, &quot;Big Iron&quot;, which used an early Marty Robbins&#x27; vocal track.

&quot;Cowboy Songs&quot; and its follow-up albums were so successful that they inspired the formation of Warner Western, a new subsidiary label of Warner Bros. Records devoted to western music and cowboy poetry. In 1992, Warner Western issued albums by Don Edwards, Waddie Mitchell, and the Sons of the San Joaquin. All three records were produced by Murphey.

In 1995, Murphey further demonstrated his musical ambitions with the concept album &quot;Sagebrush Symphony&quot;, recorded live with the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra, Herb Jeffries, and the Sons of the San Joaquin. In 1997, he released the album &quot;The Horse Legends&quot;, a musical tribute to this majestic animal. The album included several new Murphey songs, a new version of &quot;Wildfire&quot;, and covers of some well-known songs, such as Dan Fogelberg&#x27;s &quot;Run for the Roses&quot; and Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;The Pony Man&quot;.

In 1998, Murphey left Warner Bros. Records and started his own record label, WestFest/Real West Productions. That year, he released &quot;Cowboy Songs Four&quot;, which contained both traditional and original cowboy songs, including &quot;Utah Carroll&quot;, &quot;Little Joe, the Wrangler&quot;, and Murphey&#x27;s &quot;Song from Lonesome Dove&quot;. In 1999, he released &quot;Acoustic Christmas Carols: Cowboy Christmas II&quot;, which included Murphey&#x27;s quiet renditions of traditional Christmas songs, and featured his son Ryan and daughter Laura.

In 2001, Murphey released a compilation of some of his best-loved songs, &quot;Playing Favorites&quot;, which included rerecorded versions of such songs as &quot;Carolina in the Pines&quot;, &quot;Cherokee Fiddle&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Logic&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Forever For&quot;, and &quot;Wildfire&quot;. He followed this up in 2002 with &quot;Cowboy Classics: Playing Favorites II&quot;, which again included re-recorded versions of some of his best-loved cowboy songs. That same year, Murphey released &quot;Cowboy Christmas III&quot;, which contained a new original song &quot;The Kill Pen&quot;, as well as original cowboy poetry written and recited by his daughter Karen. In 2004, Murphey released &quot;Live at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas&quot;, and in 2006, he released &quot;Heartland Cowboy: Cowboy Songs, Vol. 5&quot;.

Murphey has championed Western cowboy culture and the wilderness. In 1986 he founded WestFest, an annual music festival held at Copper Mountain, Colorado that celebrates western art and culture. Molly Carpenter, writing in the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot;, noted, &quot;Murphey&#x27;s love for the American West clearly comes through in his songs, painted with vivid images of the rugged mountains and vast deserts of southwest landscapes, all evidence of his travels from his native Texas to California&#x27;s Mojave Desert, Colorado&#x27;s Rockies and the wild diversity of New Mexico, his home for the past 10 years.&quot;

During the 1990s, in a further effort to preserve the traditions of the West, Murphey led a group of performers—including cowboy poet Waddie Mitchell and western music historian and troubadour Don Edwards — in a series of improvisational concerts called &quot;Cowboy Logic&quot;, which toured throughout the United States, including such unlikely locations as New York City and Las Vegas. Waddy Mitchell is the co-founder of the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering. Murphey met Mitchell there in 1986, the first such event he had ever attended. He later described the transforming event as &quot;a religious experience ... I&#x27;d been collecting cowboy music and performing it among my friends. But when I saw a lot of other guys like me and also women performing this music and enjoying each other&#x27;s company, it was the most important thing that had happened to me in years in my musical life.&quot;

On May 22, 2007, he made a rare appearance in New York City to perform &quot;Wildfire&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The song had become one of Letterman&#x27;s favorites and was included regularly on the show. That same month, Murphey organized and performed for John Wayne&#x27;s 100th Birthday Celebration, with the approval of the John Wayne Family. Murphey was commended by the White House for his activities. Later that year, he released three DVDs detailing his love of the cowboy ways, life, and preservation of the American West traditions. The DVDs document his trail rides, cattle drives, and Cowboy Poetry gatherings. One of Murphey&#x27;s Cowboy Christmas Ball concerts, recorded in Oklahoma City, was included as a fourth DVD in the combination CD/DVD set.

In December 2007, Murphey released &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Christmas&quot; based on a poem by Michael E. Marks, a soldier serving in Iraq. Marks sent the poem to Murphey, who was so moved by the poem he sought permission to set it to music, which he did. He started including the song in all his concerts, including his Cowboy Christmas Ball concerts, to long standing ovations after its performance, which prompted its release in December 2007.

==Bluegrass years==

In February 2009, Murphey released &quot;Buckaroo Blue Grass&quot;, which marked a return to his bluegrass musical roots. Murphey&#x27;s love of Bluegrass music dates back to when he sang lead vocals with the Earl Scruggs Band. Over the years, his songs have been recorded by Bluegrass artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver, the Country Gentlemen, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.

On Buckaroo Bluegrass, Murphey offers new versions of his famous Bluegrass songs, such as &quot;Carolina in the Pines&quot;, &quot;Fiddlin&#x27; Man&quot;, &quot;Lost River&quot;, and &quot;What Am I Doing Hanging Around&quot;. Murphey also includes new Bluegrass versions of several of his classics, such as &quot;Boy from the Country&quot;, &quot;Dancing in the Meadow&quot;, and &quot;Healing Spring&quot;. The album includes two new songs, &quot;Close to the Land&quot;, the theme song of the PBS documentary television series America&#x27;s Heartland, and &quot;Lone Cowboy&quot;, a song that reflects Murphey&#x27;s experiences as a solo artist performing throughout the West at music festivals, cowboy gatherings, historical theaters, and trail rides. Michael&#x27;s son, Ryan, produced the album, and added acoustic guitar and vocals.

In February 2010, Murphey released a follow-up album, &quot;Buckaroo Blue Grass II – Riding Song&quot;, which follows the production approach of the first album.

In May 2011, Murphey gave a benefit concert at the Prairie Rose Chuckwagon Supper near Benton, Kansas to help save the cabin where Brewster Higley wrote the song &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, Kansas&#x27; state song. &quot;He might have been living anywhere,&quot; Murphey noted, &quot;but he was inspired by that place. This song gives focus to the heritage of the American West, to the prairie and its songs, poems and literature.&quot; Murphey made his first pilgrimage to the cabin prior to the concert, where he performed the song.

In June 2011, Murphey released &quot;Tall Grass &amp; Cool Water&quot;, subtitled Cowboy Songs VI and Buckaroo Blue Grass III. The CD includes two classics from the Sons of the Pioneers, &quot;Cool Water&quot; and &quot;Way Out There&quot;, as well as other Western classics such as &quot;Texas Cowboy&quot;, &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;, and &quot;The James Gang Trilogy&quot;. Murphey closes out the album with a beautiful duet with Carin Mari, &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot;.

On September 4, 2011, Murphey performed at the wedding of long-time friend David Lauren and Lauren Bush, the niece of former President George W. Bush, at Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Double RL Ranch near Ridgway, Colorado. The event was called &quot;America&#x27;s Royal Wedding&quot;. Murphey, who helped Ralph Lauren find the ranch they now call home, has been friends with the Lauren family for nearly 30 years. &quot;I go there to write songs from time to time&quot;, Murphey noted, &quot;It&#x27;s the most spectacular ranch in the Rockies.&quot; At David Lauren&#x27;s request, Murphey performed &quot;Vanishing Breed&quot; for the couple&#x27;s first dance. Murphey wrote the song at a cabin on the Lauren ranch in the 1980s. Murphey and his Rio Grande Band played nearly six hours for the Lauren and Bush families.

In January 2012, &quot;Tall Grass &amp; Cool Water&quot; became the number 1 album on the Top 20 Western Music Albums Chart of the Western Music Association.

In July 2013, Murphey released &quot;Red River Drifter&quot;, his first album of all new original songs in 20 years. The album reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Bluegrass Albums chart. He was named among the top 50 Greatest Country &amp; Western singers by &quot;American Cowboy&quot; magazine.

==Legacy==

Murphey has had a successful music career that has spanned four decades and included such musical genres as folk, country, rock, popular, western, and cowboy music. As a singer, songwriter, and producer, he has contributed some of the best-loved songs of his generation. His songs have been recorded by Johnny Cash, Kenny Rogers, John Denver, Cher, Lyle Lovett, Flatt and Scruggs, Claire Hamill, Hoyt Axton, Roger Miller, Bobbie Gentry, Michael Nesmith, and the Monkees. Murphey is the narrator of the short film &quot;Spirit of the Cowgirl&quot; at the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas

Murphey was so pivotal to the foundation of progressive country that one of the many names for the genre, &quot;Cosmic Cowboy music&quot;, was taken from one of Murphey&#x27;s songs. Murphey played a major role in the resurrection of the cowboy song genre, recording and producing some of the most successful cowboy music of the past forty years. His album &quot;Cowboy Songs&quot; inspired a whole series of albums. For his accomplishments in the Western and Cowboy Music field, Murphey received five awards from the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, formerly known as the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City.

==Political views==
Murphey has long been a champion of the western wilderness and wildlife, and has lent his support to various political causes associated with western culture and ideals. Early in his career, for example, he supported the Native American rights movement, which used his song, &quot;Geronimo&#x27;s Cadillac&quot;, as an anthem. In 1986, he founded an annual festival, WestFest, celebrating western art and culture in an effort to preserve the traditions of the West. He has been a long-time supporter of the conservation movement, attempting to find a middle ground between ranchers and activists on opposite sides of environmental issues.

In the past decade, Murphey has focused his political energies on the issue of private property rights—especially in the western and southwestern United States. In 2006, he released &quot;The Ballad of Kit Laney&quot; in support of the New Mexico rancher&#x27;s fight with the United States Forest Service over water rights. Laney was imprisoned for assault after standing up to federal agents who seized his ranch in 2004. Murphey helped form the Farmers&#x27; Freedom Agriculture Alliance and scheduled a benefit—The Farmers&#x27; Freedom Concert—to protest unfair land acquisitions across the western states. Murphey&#x27;s opposition to the political forces threatening the American family farmer and rancher transcends political party affiliation. &quot;I can tell you,&quot; Murphey observed, &quot;that politics—doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s Democrats or Republicans—have been involved with big agribusiness for a long, long time.&quot;

<text>A presentation conveys information from a speaker to an audience. Presentations are typically demonstrations, introduction, lecture, or speech meant to inform, persuade, inspire, motivate, build goodwill, or present a new idea/product. Presentations usually require preparation, organization, event planning, writing, use of visual aids, dealing with stress, and answering questions. &quot;The key elements of a presentation consists of presenter, audience, message, reaction and method to deliver speech for organizational success in an effective manner.&quot; Presentations are widely used in tertiary work settings such as accountants giving a detailed report of a company&#x27;s financials or an entrepreneur pitching their venture idea to investors. The term can also be used for a formal or ritualized introduction or offering, as with the presentation of a debutante. Presentations in certain formats are also known as keynote address. Interactive presentations, in which the audience is involved, are also represented more and more frequently. Instead of a monologue, this creates a dialogue between the speaker and the audience. The advantages of an interactive presentation is for example, that it attracts more attention from the audience and that the interaction creates a sense of community.

==Visual elements==
A presentation program is commonly used to generate the presentation content, some of which also allow presentations to be developed collaboratively, e.g. using the Internet by geographically disparate collaborators. Presentation viewers can be used to combine content from different sources into one presentation. Some of the popular presentation products used across the globe are offered by Apple, Google and Microsoft. 

Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides are effective tools to develop slides, both Google Slides and Microsoft PowerPoint allows groups to work together online to update each account as it is edited. Content such as text, images, links, and effects are added into each of the presentation programs to deliver useful, consolidated information to a group. Visual elements add to the effectiveness of a presentation and help emphasize the key points being made through the use of type, color, images/videos, graphs, layout, and transitions.

=== Legibility ===
One common means to help one convey information and the audience stay on track is through the incorporation of text in a legible font size and type. According to the article &quot;Prepare and Deliver an Effective Presentation&quot;, effective presentations typically use serif fonts (e.g. Times New Roman, Garamond, Baskerville, etc.) for the smaller text and sans serif fonts (e.g. Helvetica, Futura, Arial, etc.) for headings and larger text. The typefaces are used along with type size to improve readability for the audience. A combination of these typefaces can also be used to create emphasis. The majority of the fonts within a presentation are kept simple to aid in readability. Font styles, like bold, italic, and underline, are used to highlight important points.

It is possible to emphasize text and still maintain its readability by using contrasting colors. For example, black words on a white background emphasize the text being displayed but still helps maintain its readability. Text that contrasts with the background of a slide also enhances visibility. Readability and visibility enhance a presentation experience, which contributes to the effectiveness of it. Certain colors are also associated with specific emotions and the proper application of these colors adds to the effectiveness of a presentation through the creation of an immersive experience for an audience.

=== Images/videos ===
Large images relevant to the presentation attract an audience’s attention which in turn can clarify the topics within the presentation. Using pictures sparingly helps support other presentation elements (e.g. text). Short videos are used to help the presenter reinforce their message to the audience. With the additional reinforcement that images and videos offer, the effectiveness of a presentation may be improved.

== Assessing presentations ==
There lacks a comprehensive list of criteria common among research studies or educational institutions in a typical presentation rubric used to assess presentations. Nevertheless, De Grez et al., in consultation with experienced higher education teachers, developed a rubric composed of nine evaluative criteria, of which five dealt with one’s manner of delivery (interaction with audience, enthusiasm, eye contact, vocal delivery, and body language), three were content related (structure, quality of introduction, and conclusion), and one evaluated general professionalism.

<doc id="626515" wikidata="Q5631771" url="?curid=626515" title="HMS Camperdown (D32)">
<text>HMS &quot;Camperdown&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named after the Battle of Camperdown, a naval engagement between the British and Dutch that took place in 1797, and which resulted in a British victory.

She was built by Fairfields and launched on 8 February 1944 and commissioned on 18 June 1945.

==Service==
&quot;Camperdown&quot; was despatched to the Far East, joining the 19th Destroyer Flotilla of the British Pacific Fleet after VJ Day and so did not see action during the Second World War. In November 1946, &quot;Camperdown&quot;, along with the rest of the 19th Flotilla, returned to the United Kingdom, and was placed in reserve at Devonport in April 1947.

&quot;Camperdown&quot; was refitted from January to May 1950, and on 26 May 1953, was recommissioned for trials. She formed part of the Fleet Review on the Solent to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June 1953 as part of the reserve fleet, a record of which can be found displayed on board the royal yacht .

In 1953, at Plymouth, &quot;Camperdown&quot; was accidentally rammed by , a (renamed &quot;Compass Rose&quot; for her role in the film &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;), causing damage to the destroyer. &quot;Camperdown&quot; was refitted and modernised at Liverpool between 18 May 1956 and 29 October 1957. After trials, on 10 December 1957, the ship joined the 3rd Destroyer Squadron, which alternated between service with the Home Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet, replacing , which had been withdrawn from use because of poor condition. On 21 September 1958, a fire broke out in &quot;Camperdown&quot;″s boiler room while the destroyer was taking part in a NATO exercise, damaging electrical cables but causing no casualties. In 1960, &quot;Camperdown&quot; joined the 1st Destroyer Squadron, with spells with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. In 1962, &quot;Camperdown&quot; was placed on the disposal list and in 1970, she was finally scrapped at Faslane.

<doc id="626522" wikidata="Q720568" url="?curid=626522" title="Levi Lincoln Sr.">
<text>Levi Lincoln Sr. (May 15, 1749 – April 14, 1820) was an American revolutionary, lawyer, and statesman from Massachusetts. A Democratic-Republican, he most notably served as Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s first attorney general, and played a significant role in the events that led to the celebrated &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; court case. He served two terms as the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, acting as governor for the remainder of Governor James Sullivan&#x27;s term after his death in December 1808. Lincoln was unsuccessful in his bid to be elected governor in his own right in 1809.

Born in Hingham, Massachusetts, Lincoln was educated at Harvard, and studied law with Joseph Hawley before establishing a law practice in Worcester, Massachusetts. He was active in local politics, and participated in the convention that drafted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1779. He supported Quock Walker, a former slave seeking confirmation of his freedom under that constitution in 1783. He entered national politics with his election to the United States House of Representatives in 1800, but was immediately tapped by Jefferson to become Attorney General. Lincoln served Jefferson as a consultant on the politics of New England, and was influential in the distribution of patronage in the region. He served on a commission that resolved claims emanating from the Yazoo land scandal in Georgia, and advised Jefferson on matters related to the Louisiana Purchase.

He returned to Massachusetts, where he remained politically active in the state. He established Republican dominance in Worcester, even though the state was dominated by Federalists. He was elected lieutenant governor under James Sullivan in 1807, but failed to win election in his own right in 1809 in a highly partisan election. He retired from politics in 1811, declining nomination to the Supreme Court because of his health.

==Early years==
Lincoln was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, on May 15, 1749, to Enoch and Rachel (Fearing) Lincoln. His father first apprenticed him to a local blacksmith, but the boy&#x27;s lack of interest in that business and clear interest in reading led to his eventual enrollment in Harvard College. He graduated in 1772, and studied law under Joseph Hawley in Northampton. When news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord reached Northampton, he volunteered for military service, but only served for a short time, marching with the local militia to Cambridge, where militia were besieging British-occupied Boston.

Lincoln did not stay long, and soon returned to Northampton, where he passed the bar. He established a practice in Worcester in 1775, where his business flourished because most of the Worcester lawyers had been Loyalist and had fled to Boston. From 1775 to 1781, he served as clerk of the court and probate judge of Worcester County, and served the town of Worcester in a variety of posts into the 1790s. He was elected in 1779 to the state convention that drafted the state constitution. During these years, Lincoln rose in prominence to become one of the largest landowners in Worcester. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.

In 1781, Lincoln was one of the lawyers (another was Northampton lawyer and future governor Caleb Strong) who worked on a series of legal cases surrounding Quock Walker, a former slave seeking to claim his freedom. One of the cases, &quot;Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Nathaniel Jennison&quot;, firmly established that slavery was incompatible with the new state constitution. Although the decision by Justice William Cushing was based on the state constitution&#x27;s language &quot;all men are born free and equal&quot;, Lincoln in his arguments had instead appealed to natural law and God&#x27;s law. He was also elected to the Continental Congress in 1781, but declined to serve. Lincoln was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1796, and to both the House and State Senate in 1797; he chose to sit in the Senate.

==United States Attorney General==
At first a weak Federalist, Lincoln became more closely associated with the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party. He repeatedly ran for election to the United States House of Representatives in three consecutive elections in the 1790s (1794, 1796, and 1798), losing each time to Federalist Dwight Foster. Foster was elected to the Senate in a special election in early 1800, opening his House seat; after a series of special elections (in most of which Lincoln won a plurality but not the required majority of votes), Lincoln was finally elected to the seat in December 1800. His service was brief: on March 5, 1801, President Jefferson appointed him attorney general, an office he held until March 1805. Jefferson&#x27;s choice of Lincoln was supported by his close advisor and eventual Treasury Secretary, Albert Gallatin, who described Lincoln as &quot;a good lawyer, a fine scholar, a man of great discretion and sound judgment&quot; and a &quot;sound and decided Republican&quot;.

Since the post of Attorney General was then part-time, Lincoln spent most of his time in that office in Worcester, advancing the Democratic-Republican cause. In addition to distributing federal patronage dollars, he frequently reported to Jefferson on political sentiment in New England, and advocated for Republican positions in the newspapers. In 1801, he founded the &quot;National Aegis&quot;, a newspaper dedicated to advancing Republican arguments and countering Federalist positions printed in other Massachusetts publications. During his years as Attorney General, the Democratic-Republicans successfully gained control of most of Worcester&#x27;s political establishment, even while much of Massachusetts (including Worcester County) remained generally Federalist. Lincoln was regularly the subject of unflattering partisan newspaper reporting, as well as sermons delivered by influential Congregational ministers. The negative sermonizing prompted Lincoln to publish a pamphlet entitled &quot;Letters to the People, by a Farmer&quot; in 1802, in which he lambasted the Federalists for politicizing the clergy. Reverend William Bentley observed that Lincoln&#x27;s criticism was a serious blow: &quot;[N]ever did the Clergy suffer a more serious diminution of their influence and of their power.&quot;

===Participation in &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;===
When Jefferson took office, he moved as quickly as possible to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his secretary state, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, because of illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State) and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions.

Some intended recipients of the commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury&#x27;s attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee&#x27;s questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to answer the questions. The justices granted him time but made it clear that he must answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked &quot;[w]hat had been done with the commissions,&quot; Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for the performance, writing that he &quot;was asked a simple question, but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing... and then he made out to remember that he had forgot all about it&quot;.

===Georgia land scandal===

During the 1790s, politicians and land speculators in Georgia perpetrated fraudulent and corrupt land sales in an area that is now a large portion of Alabama and Mississippi. When the fraud was exposed in 1795, there was significant public outcry, and the Georgia legislation authorizing the sales was repealed. This led to a host of claims and litigation, since in a number of cases, land was afterward resold to unsuspecting third parties. President Jefferson eventually established a three-person commission to resolve conflicting claims arising from the fraud. Lincoln was appointed to this commission, which developed legislation to resolve the issue. Eventually approved by Congress, Georgia&#x27;s claims to the area were extinguished and some land was reserved to resolve other outstanding claims. The commission was also responsible for documenting and reporting on the nature and extent of the fraud, activities in which Lincoln was heavily involved.

===Foreign policy===
Prior to Jefferson&#x27;s presidency, the United States had paid tribute to a number of Arab states in the Mediterranean to prevent attacks on its shipping. By the time Jefferson assumed office, the United States Navy had been developed to the point where it might adequately defend American shipping interests. Jefferson consequently refused to pay tribute in 1801 to Yusuf Karamanli, the ruler of Tripoli, after which the Tripolitans began attacking and seizing American merchant vessels. In a cabinet discussion held in early 1801 to formulate a response, it was suggested that the President declare war on Tripoli. Lincoln pointed out that only Congress had the authority to declare war, but the rest of the cabinet was intent on taking some sort of action. The matter was tabled until May 1801, when the cabinet voted to send a naval squadron to the area to defend the country&#x27;s merchant interests. Jefferson never asked for or received from Congress a formal war declaration against the Barbary states.

When Napoleon sought to sell the French territory of Louisiana to the United States in 1802, Jefferson was concerned over the political consequences of acquiring a large tract of what was perceived then as predominantly Southern territory, as well as a possible lack of constitutional authority to make the purchase. To circumvent these concerns, Lincoln made a novel proposal that the territory could be acquired by expanding an existing state&#x27;s borders, effecting a purchase that would not require a constitutional amendment. This proposal was rejected by Jefferson and his other advisors, and the purchase was ultimately made in spite of the standing constitutional question.

==Massachusetts political offices==
In 1804, Lincoln informed Jefferson that, for personal reasons, he would leave the post of Attorney General. His resignation became official on March 3, 1805.

In Massachusetts, Lincoln once again became active in state politics. He was a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council in 1806, and was nominated the following year as a candidate for lieutenant governor. The Democratic-Republicans nominated James Sullivan as the gubernatorial candidate, but because the moderate Sullivan was distrusted by radicals in the party, they were able to secure Lincoln&#x27;s place on the ticket. Federalists seized on the divisions in the opposition, claiming that Sullivan was a pawn, and that he would soon be replaced by the &quot;Jacobin Lincoln—a man so little known, and so unpopular where known, that they dare not risk as a candidate for the office he aspires to.&quot; The election was a sweep for Lincoln&#x27;s party, which gained control over the entire state government. Sullivan and Lincoln were reelected in 1808, but Sullivan died in December 1808, and Lincoln became acting governor. From these positions, he continued to actively support the policies of President Jefferson, despite their growing unpopularity with the generally Federalist Massachusetts population and business interests.
Lincoln ran for election as governor in his own right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson&#x27;s economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration&#x27;s repeal of the embargo before the election notwithstanding).

Lincoln was again chosen to serve on the Governor&#x27;s Council in 1810 and 1811. In 1811, President James Madison offered him a position as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, but he declined on account of failing eyesight. Lincoln retired to his Worcester estate, where he took an active interest in farming; his pursuit of scientific interests related to agriculture were widely recognized, and he served as the first president of the Worcester Agricultural Society, founded in 1818.

Lincoln was additionally a founding member of the American Antiquarian Society along with one of his sons Levi Lincoln Jr. in 1812.

Lincoln died in Worcester on April 14, 1820. His original burial site is not documented in the family genealogy, but he was eventually reinterred at Worcester Rural Cemetery after its establishment in 1838.

==Family and legacy==
Lincoln married Martha Waldo (1761–1828) of Worcester in 1781, with whom he had ten children (three of whom died young). His eldest child, Levi Jr., and a younger son Enoch both followed their father into politics: Levi Jr. became one of the longest-serving governors of Massachusetts, and Enoch was Governor of Maine.

When Lincoln moved to Worcester, he acquired a large tract of land near what is now the downtown area of the city. This land was mostly developed by his heirs, and is part of the Lincoln Estate-Elm Park Historic District. Worcester&#x27;s Gov. Levi Lincoln House is named for Levi Jr. As a consequence of the family&#x27;s prominence in the city, there are a number of landmarks (streets, buildings, and parks) in Worcester bearing the Lincoln name.

Lincoln was distantly related to Abraham Lincoln, sharing a common ancestor with the sixteenth U.S. president in Samuel Lincoln, who had settled in Hingham, Massachusetts, in the 17th century.

<doc id="626523" wikidata="Q515259" url="?curid=626523" title="Oscar Goodman">
<text>Oscar Baylin Goodman (born July 26, 1939) is an American attorney and politician. A Democrat-turned-independent, Goodman was the mayor of Las Vegas, Nevada from 1999 to 2011. His wife, Carolyn Goodman, succeeded him as mayor in 2011.

== Early life and education ==
Goodman was born and raised in a Jewish family in Philadelphia. After attending Central High School for a time, he graduated from The Haverford School. He graduated from Haverford College in 1961, then received his J.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1964. He and his wife Carolyn have four children.

== Career ==
=== Defense attorney ===
During his career as a defense attorney, Goodman represented defendants accused of being some of the leading organized crime figures in Las Vegas, such as: Meyer Lansky, Nicky Scarfo, Herbert &quot;Fat Herbie&quot; Blitzstein, Phil Leonetti, former Stardust Casino boss Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal, and Jamiel &quot;Jimmy&quot; Chagra, a 1970s drug trafficker who was acquitted of ordering the murder of Federal Judge John H. Wood, Jr. One of his notorious clients was Chicago mobster Anthony &quot;Tony the Ant&quot; Spilotro, who was known to have a short and violent temper. In the semi-factual 1995 movie &quot;Casino&quot;, the character of Nicky Santoro was based on Spilotro, and was portrayed by actor Joe Pesci. Goodman had a cameo appearance in the film as himself, where he was depicted defending “Ace Rothstein,” a character closely based on Lefty Rosenthal, and played by Robert De Niro.

Goodman also represented former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock, who was convicted of accepting illegal campaign contributions, and eventually forced to resign. Hedgecock was later cleared of all charges on appeal. Goodman was a senior partner in the law firm of Goodman &amp; Chesnoff.

=== Civil service ===
In 1964, Goodman and his wife became active in the local Jewish federation soon after they moved to Las Vegas. Carolyn eventually served as head of the federation&#x27;s women&#x27;s divisions.

Through the years of 1980–81, he served as president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Goodman was also a member of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

== Mayor of Las Vegas (1999–2011) ==
=== Elections ===
On June 8, 1999, Goodman was elected mayor of Las Vegas after he received 63.76% (32,765) of the votes, while his opponent, then-Las Vegas City Councilman Arnie Adamsen, received 36.24% (18,620). In 2003, Goodman was re-elected to a second four-year term, and defeated five opponents after he received 85.72% (29,356) of the votes. On April 3, 2007, he was re-elected to a third and final term, with 83.69% (26,845) of the votes, and once again defeated five opponents. Despite having been called Las Vegas’ “most popular mayor,” the city has term limit laws that restrict mayors to a maximum of three terms. In 2011, Carolyn Goodman was elected to succeed her husband as mayor, after she earned 60% of the votes.

=== Tenure ===
On June 28, 1999, Goodman was the first mayor of Las Vegas to have his image placed on $5 and $25 casino chips issued by a Las Vegas casino. The two chips were issued by the Four Queens Hotel and Casino in Downtown Las Vegas. In 2006, the Four Queens put out a $200 Silver Strike with the likeness of Goodman on it.

Goodman has been vocal about having a Major League Baseball team relocate to Las Vegas. In 2004, the city failed to secure a move by the Montreal Expos to the city. Instead, the team relocated to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals. Later that year, Goodman met with officials of the Florida Marlins. The Chicago White Sox had considered a move, but negotiations failed after Chicago officials provided incentives for the team to stay.

Goodman worked to get a National Football League team to relocate to Las Vegas. On April 24, 2006, he called the San Diego Chargers, and asked if they would be interested in moving. Because of a contract, the city could not talk about a possible move. On January 4, 2007, he called again, since the team was not allowed to talk to other cities about a possible move. Again, Goodman was turned down “for the time being.” According to Mark Fabiani, the Chargers’ general counsel, Goodman was a longtime season ticket holder of the Chargers, and a fan of the team. The Chargers ultimately decided to relocate to Los Angeles instead. In 2017, under the tenure of Carolyn Goodman as mayor, the Oakland Raiders agreed to relocate to Las Vegas.

In 2003, Goodman was voted the “Least Effective Public Official” in the &quot;Review-Journal&quot;&#x27;s annual reader&#x27;s poll.

In July 2006 Goodman criticized the Ubisoft game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six: Vegas&quot; for its premise of terrorism in Las Vegas, because he thought it may tarnish the city&#x27;s image. He stated, &quot;It&#x27;s based on a false premise... It could be harmful economically, and it may be something that&#x27;s not entitled to free speech (protection)... I will ask... whether or not we can stop it.&quot; In 2009 and 2010, Goodman was angered by President Barack Obama&#x27;s allegedly negative remarks about Las Vegas.

After winning the mayoral election in 2007, Goodman, like his counterpart Michael Bloomberg in New York City, looked into a means to change the city charter to remove term limits. He ultimately did not pursue changes to Las Vegas law.

Currently, prostitution is legal in Nevada only in rural counties with fewer than 400,000 residents, a requirement which excludes Clark County and the city of Las Vegas from allowing the practice. Goodman supports legalizing prostitution in the city&#x27;s downtown area as a revenue generator and tool for revitalization. Some journalists have criticized this position.

== Post-mayoral career ==
Goodman currently serves as Of Counsel to Goodman Law Group, a Las Vegas law firm formed by his son, Ross C. Goodman.

His memoir, &quot;Being Oscar: From Mob Lawyer to Mayor of Las Vegas&quot;, written with George Anastasia, was published in 2013.

=== Speculation of candidacies for other offices ===
Goodman had entertained the idea of seeking the Democratic nomination in the 2006 United States Senate election in Nevada, in order to run against incumbent Republican Senator John Ensign. He ultimately announced that he would not run for the nomination, which went to Jack Carter, the son of President Jimmy Carter.

Goodman fueled speculation that he might run as an independent in the 2010 Nevada gubernatorial election against incumbent Republican Jim Gibbons and presumptive Democratic candidate Rory Reid. However, Goodman decided not to run for governor, citing his desire to stay close to his family, and objections to moving to Carson City.

Las Vegas commentator Dayvid Figler wrote in 2009 that Goodman might become the first Jewish president of the United States.

== In popular culture ==

Goodman appeared as himself in the 1995 Martin Scorsese film &quot;Casino&quot;, reprising his real life role as a lawyer for both Frank Rosenthal and Anthony Spilotro, respectively renamed Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Later on, he made another brief appearance in the film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; in the DVD extras. In 2006, he appeared as himself in the Direct-to-DVD film &quot;Bachelor Party Vegas&quot;.

In 2000, a bobblehead doll of Goodman was issued as a promotion during a Las Vegas 51s baseball game.

As a celebrity photographer for the Playboy Cyber Club, Goodman shot a topless pictorial of Miss January 2001 Irina Voronina for the website.

In 2002, Goodman became a spokesman for Bombay Sapphire gin. He donated his $100,000 salary to charity, including $50,000 to The Meadows School founded by his wife. He would later generate controversy in 2005 when he joked about his love of the gin before an elementary school class.

In 2003, &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; columnist John L. Smith wrote a book chronicling Goodman&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Of Rats and Men: Oscar Goodman&#x27;s Life from Mob Mouthpiece to Mayor of Las Vegas&quot;.

Goodman guest-starred as himself three times on the CBS series &quot;.&quot; The episodes Goodman was featured in included: “Early Rollout,” as a lawyer for a suspect during an interrogation; “Sqweegel,” where he defended Ann-Margret&#x27;s character from being harassed by the LVPD; and “Maid Man,” where he was shot while emceeing the opening of the Mob Museum, which was re-created for the show in advance of its opening.

Goodman also guest-starred as himself in several episodes of NBC comedy-drama Las Vegas. 

Goodman was interviewed for the television programs &quot;The Making of the Mob: New York&quot; and &quot;The Making of the Mob: Chicago&quot; in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

<text>The Master of Music (MM or MMus) is, as an academic title, the first graduate degree in music awarded by universities and conservatories. The MM combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually performance in singing or instrument playing, composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history, music theory, or music pedagogy. The degree, which takes one or two years of full-time study to complete, prepares students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers, according to their area of specialization. The MM is often required as the minimum teaching credential for university, college, and conservatory instrumental or vocal teaching positions.

==Types==
The MM is widely available in performance (sometimes with a specialization in music teaching/pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. The music education degree may also be awarded as a more specifically titled Master of Music Education (MME or MMEd). The master&#x27;s in music theory, musicology (commonly called &quot;music history&quot;), and ethnomusicology is typically the Master of Arts (MA). Nevertheless, some universities in the UK (e.g. Sheffield University) utilize the MM as a special research degree, in which the student undertakes original research and prepares a written thesis or similar document. Programs focusing on preparing musicians for careers in sacred music for churches and houses of worship may alternatively be called Master of Sacred Music (MSM).

==Components of degree==

===Applied studies and courses===
One of the major differences between a typical MA degree and the MM is that whereas MA degree students often undertake original research and prepare and submit a thesis or similar research document, MM students focus on practical, applied areas, as set out in their MM area of specialization, which are typically instrumental or vocal performance, composition of new music, or conducting. The latter may focus on orchestral conducting, choral conducting, or a combination of both.

In MM programs, the student spends intensive lesson time with a professor. For singers and instrumentalists, this is with a voice and instrument professor, respectively. For composition students, they take coaching sessions with composer-professors. For conducting students, they get conducting coaching from a conductor-professor at the university. MM students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons with a professor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many MM programs, all of the different MM streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses, as these core courses are a necessary background for all three careers. The different streams may also have different required courses for each stream. For example, vocal performance students may be required to take an opera or art song class; orchestral instrumentalists may be required to take an orchestral excerpts or orchestral audition preparation class; composition students may be required to take composition courses; and conducting students may be required to take conducting, score-reading, or piano classes.

Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing an MM in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history (e.g., on historically authentic performance). Some institutions permit MM students to do a sub-specialization in a field outside music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a MM in piano pedagogy may be able to do a sub-specialization in the psychology of learning in the university&#x27;s department of psychology or take a sub-specialization in educational methods in the university&#x27;s department of education. Doing sub-specializations outside the faculty of music typically requires the approval of both the faculty of music and the other faculty (e.g., psychology, education, etc.).

===Recitals and comprehensive exams===
The last stage of the MM is usually the performance of one or two recitals and completion of comprehensive exams. Most programs require that the recitals include advanced-grade pieces that are drawn from the different eras of music history, such as Baroque-era solo suites (late 17th to mid 18th century), a Classical-era (mid to late 18th century) sonata or concerto; a Romantic-era (19th century) concerto or solo; and a Contemporary era (20th and 21st century) piece. The specific components of the recital vary between schools. Some programs allow students to include chamber pieces, in which the student plays a major role as part of a chamber group, for some of the pieces.

In some schools, students are required to give a lecture for one or both of the recitals, in which they explain the historical context or music theory or compositional issues involved in the pieces. This approach, called a lecture-recital, is designed to give students experience explaining and contextualizing the pieces or songs they perform. This skill is important for performers because many also teach or coach students, and some will go on to become professors, where they may be required to give lectures on music history, theory, or composition.

Some MM programs require students to pass comprehensive exams on their area of specialization and subjects such as music history and music theory. The goal of this exam is to ensure that the student has obtained a well-rounded knowledge and understanding that extends beyond their specialization. Since the MM is the standard minimum credential to teach applied subjects (performance or composition) at universities and conservatories, it is important that MM graduates have this broader understanding of music history and theory.

==Admission requirements==
To be admitted to a MM program, most institutions require an undergraduate degree or diploma in music, such as a BM or BA with a major in music, usually with a grade average of B+ or higher. MM programs in performance usually require a live audition that includes advanced pieces (or for singers, songs) from a wide range of styles, typically ranging from the Baroque era (1600-1750), the Classical music period (1750-1800), the Romantic music era (1800-1910) to the 20th and/or 21st century. Singers typically perform arias from operas and art songs, which are typically accompanied by a pianist. Instrumental musicians typically perform solo J. S. Bach or other unaccompanied repertoire, a movement from a sonata, and a movement from a virtuoso concerto. Instrumentalists who play orchestral instruments (violin family, woodwinds, brass, etc.) may be asked to perform excerpts from the standard orchestral repertoire. Auditionees are typically told which pieces and movements to prepare; some schools even give the bar numbers or rehearsal letters (e.g., Beethoven Symphony no. 5, movement 1, bar 100 to 120).

Some institutions use videotaped recitals or performances as a pre-screening method. This approach helps to eliminate candidates who do not meet the school&#x27;s minimum performance standards, and as such, it saves those candidates the time and cost of traveling to the institution for an in-person audition, and it also saves the school the cost of having a panel of professors hear the candidate on location. Some universities have multiple audition locations to reduce the traveling expenses faced by candidates. For example, a school located on the west coast of the United States might offer the option of auditioning at a central and eastern US location. The school&#x27;s professors who form the audition panel travel to these other locations to hear auditionees. Some schools which normally require in-person auditions waive this requirement for students who play the larger instruments (e.g., double bass and tuba), and allow a videotape to be sent instead.

Applicants are typically asked for official transcripts from all post-secondary programs and letters of recommendation from music professors and teachers. For most graduate programs, transcripts of every program or degree are required, whether or not the degree was completed. For students who have started out, but then withdrawn from a number of programs, they may have to request transcripts from many institutions. To protect against applicants changing marks on the transcripts using forgery, most schools require that the transcripts be sent directly from the previous institution&#x27;s registrar to the music school, or that the transcripts be in sealed envelopes with the other school&#x27;s registrar&#x27;s seal (stamp) over the closure. Some programs may also request a statement of intent/statement of purpose or another type of essay, in which the candidate explains why she wishes to be admitted, and sets out her professional, performance or career goals. Some programs may request copies of recital programs from previous performances or a list of performance experience, which may include, for orchestral instrumentalists, orchestra experience.

In some universities, candidates must also be admitted to the university&#x27;s graduate school; as such, applicants may have to achieve a certain mark on standardized tests, such as the GRE. Similarly, students from countries where the official language is not that of the university may be required to achieve a certain mark on standardized language tests. For example, students applying to a US MM program who come from a country where English is not an official language, may be required to pass the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Admission to MM programs in conducting often requires a video recording of a live rehearsal and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings (audio or video) of live performances.

==Careers==
The MMus degree is usually undertaken to prepare students to be professional performers (typically either singers or instrumental musicians), conductors, and composers. As such many recipients of the MMus degree do not seek further formal education after they complete the MMus. The MMus is typically the minimum credential that allows them to teach instrumental or vocal performance at universities, colleges, and conservatories.

Some institutions will also hire teachers who do not have the MMus who hold an Artist&#x27;s Diploma or similar diploma, and/or who have had a significant performing career as either a solo recitalist, chamber musician or orchestral musician. Some graduates do additional graduate or professional study in other areas, such as a law degree or medical degree.

The combination of an MMus and a professional degree could enable the degree holder to work in fields where music and law (or medicine) overlap. Recipients of the MMus may also make use of the general education provided in the degree (e.g., in writing and researching) to get a job in government, university administration, or in the non-profit or arts administration sector.

Other recipients of the MMus may go on to further graduate studies in music by continuing their MMus specialization in performance or conducting at the doctoral level, by completing a DMA (Doctor of Musical Arts) degree in those areas. Some students branch out to another area of music at the PhD level, such as musicology or music theory. While PhD programs in musicology and music theory normally require an MA in music, in some cases, students with a MMus in performance or composition who show strong promise may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in musicology or music theory.

As well, some recipients of the MMus degree may go on to do graduate work in another area in which music is a supporting field, such as an EdD in music education (e.g., specializing in music instruction) or a master&#x27;s degree in Library Science, in order to become a music reference librarian. MMus graduates who wish to pursue graduate studies in an area that is not directly connected with music may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in areas such as women&#x27;s studies or sociology, subject to the condition that they complete a list of qualifying courses.

<text>John Middleton Clayton (July 24, 1796 – November 9, 1856) was an American lawyer and politician from Delaware. He was a member of the Whig Party who served in the Delaware General Assembly, and as U.S. Senator from Delaware and U.S. Secretary of State.

==Early life and family==

Born in Dagsboro, Delaware, son of Sarah (née Middleton) and James Clayton. His uncle, Dr. Joshua Clayton, was a former Governor of Delaware and his cousin, Thomas Clayton, was a prominent lawyer, U.S. Senator, and jurist. John M. Clayton studied at Berlin, Maryland and Milford, Delaware when his parents moved there. His boyhood home, known as the Parson Thorne Mansion, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. He graduated from Yale University in 1815, where he was a member of Brothers in Unity and then studied law at the Litchfield Law School. In 1819 he began the practice of law in Dover, Delaware.

About this time his father died and Clayton became the sole supporter of his immediate family, weekly walking the distance from Dover to Milford to see to their needs.

He married Sally Ann Fisher in 1822. She was the granddaughter of former Governor George Truitt. They had two sons, James and Charles, but she died two weeks after the birth of Charles. Clayton never remarried and raised the two boys himself.

In 1844, Clayton cultivated a tract of land near New Castle, Delaware which he called Buena Vista. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Here he built a mansion and made one of the most fruitful estates in that region. Both of his sons died while in their 20s, shortly before the death of their father.

==Delaware politics==
Clayton was elected to the Delaware House of Representatives for the 1824 session and was appointed the Delaware Secretary of State from December 1826 to October 1828. Conservative in background and outlook, Clayton quickly became a leader of the Adams faction which later developed into the Delaware Whig Party. During this time he was also the driving force in the convention that produced the Delaware Constitution of 1831.

==National politics==
In 1829, Clayton was elected to the United States Senate as its youngest member. Six years later he declined re-election, but the General Assembly elected him anyway, only to have him resign. He served from March 4, 1829, until December 29, 1836. He distinguished himself in the Senate by a speech during the debate on the Foote resolution, which, though merely relating to the survey of the public lands, introduced into the discussion the whole question of nullification. Clayton favored the extension of the charter for the Second Bank of the United States and his investigation of the Post Office Department led to its reorganization. At various times he served on the Military Affairs, Militia, District of Columbia, and Post Office Committees, but his most important position was the Chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee in the 23rd and 24th Congress.

After returning to Delaware from his first term in the United States Senate, Clayton was appointed Chief Justice of the Delaware Superior Court, replacing his cousin Thomas Clayton, who had been elected to the vacant U.S. Senate seat. He served in this position from January 16, 1837, until September 19, 1839, when he resigned to support the presidential candidacy of William Henry Harrison.
Clayton was once again elected to the United States Senate in 1845, where he opposed the annexation of Texas and the Mexican–American War but advocated the active prosecution of the latter once it was begun. His tenure was only from March 4, 1845, until February 23, 1849, as he resigned to become U.S. Secretary of State.

On March 8, 1849, Clayton became U.S. Secretary of State in the Whig administration of Zachary Taylor. His most notable accomplishment was the negotiation of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 with the British minister, Sir Henry Bulwer-Lytton. This treaty guaranteed the neutrality and encouragement of lines of travel across the isthmus at Panama, and laid the groundwork for America&#x27;s eventual building of the Panama Canal. His tenure was brief, however, ending on July 22, 1850, soon after President Taylor&#x27;s death.

As secretary of state, Clayton was intensely nationalistic and an ardent advocate of commercial expansion but his strict interpretation of international law created crises with Spain, Portugal, and France.

Clayton was again elected to the United States Senate one last time in 1853 and served from March 4, 1853, until his death on November 9, 1856. He opposed the Kansas-Nebraska Act. One of his most noted speeches delivered in the Senate was that made June 15, 1854 against the message of U.S. President Franklin Pierce, vetoing the Bill for the Benefit of the Indigent Insane, which would have ceded public lands for an insane asylum.

==Death and legacy==
After the death of his second son, Clayton moved his residence back to Dover. He died there and is buried in the Old Presbyterian Cemetery, which is at Dover, on the grounds of the Delaware State Museum.

His contemporaries considered Clayton one of the most skilled debaters and orators in the Senate. He was always accessible, and was noted for his genial disposition and brilliant conversational powers. Clayton Hall at the University of Delaware is named in his honor, as are towns in Delaware, New York, North Carolina and a county in Iowa. In 1934, the state of Delaware donated a statue of Clayton to the National Statuary Hall Collection.

==Almanac==
Elections were held the first Tuesday of October. Members of the General Assembly took office on the first Tuesday of January. State Representatives had a one-year term. The Secretary of State was appointed by the Governor and took office on the third Tuesday of January for a five-year term. The General Assembly chose the U.S. Senators, who took office March 4, for a six-year term.

<text>Cuatro Caminos (&quot;English&quot;: Four Roads) is the fifth album by Mexican rock band Café Tacuba, released in 2003.

==Background==
&quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; was produced by Gustavo Santaolalla, Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, Weezer) and Andrew Weiss (Ween).

The title &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; references the name of a major road intersection and metro station in Mexico City. The album is marked by wordplay, as in the song titles &quot;Hoy Es&quot; (sounds like &quot;Oyes&quot;, meaning &quot;You&#x27;re Listening&quot;), &quot;Soy o Estoy&quot;, and &quot;Hola Adiós&quot; (sounds like &quot;Hola a Dios&quot;, meaning &quot;Hello to God&quot;). Lead singer Rubén Albarrán was credited on this album as &quot;Élfego Buendía&quot;. This was the first Café Tacuba album to use live drums instead of drum machines.

==Reception==

&quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; was featured on year-end lists of the best albums of 2003 by several publications, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Blender&quot;. In 2004, it won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album and two Latin Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Album and Best Rock Song for &quot;Eres&quot;. Music website Club Fonograma named &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; the best album of the decade.

The song &quot;Eo&quot; appears in the soundtrack to the soccer video game &quot;FIFA Football 2004&quot;.

<text>Charles Herbert Lowe, Jr. (April 16, 1920 – September 13, 2002) was an American biologist and herpetologist.

Lowe was born in Los Angeles, California. After college he served during World War II as a U.S. Navy Ensign in the Pacific. In 1946, he enrolled at UCLA, where he received a Ph.D. in 1950. He then went to the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, where he became a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.

His interests focused on the desert fauna, especially of the Sonoran Desert. He did many extensive studies, and in 1964 published &quot;The Vertebrates of Arizona&quot;. His research in the 1960s established the parthenogenetic reproduction of many whiptail lizard species, and also discovered that the desert pupfish can tolerate temperatures up to 44 °C (112 °F) and extremely low oxygen levels. He discovered twenty new species and subspecies and published 136 scientific articles and books.

Lowe is commemorated in the scientific names of three reptiles: &quot;Lepidophyma lowei, Thamnophis sirtalis lowei&quot;, and &quot;Uta lowei&quot;.

Lowe was married and had two children. He died in 2002 after a long period of declining health.

<text> (Exult, rejoice), K. 165, is a 1773 motet by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

==History==
This religious solo motet was composed when Mozart was staying in Milan during the production of his opera &quot;Lucio Silla&quot; which was being performed there in the Teatro Regio Ducale. It was written for the castrato Venanzio Rauzzini, who had sung the part of the &quot;primo uomo&quot; Cecilio in &quot;Lucio Silla&quot; the previous year. While waiting for the end of the run (from 26 December 1772 to 25 January 1773), Mozart composed the motet for his singer, whose technical excellence he admired. Its first performance took place at the Theatine Church on 17 January 1773, while Rauzzini was still singing in Mozart&#x27;s opera at night. Mozart made some revisions around 1780. On 30 May 1779, a Trinity Sunday, a revised version was performed by Francesco Ceccarelli at the Holy Trinity Church, Salzburg. Another revised version was intended for Christmas. The manuscripts of the two Salzburg versions were discovered in 1978 in St. Jakob, Wasserburg am Inn. While in modern times the motet is usually sung by a female soprano, it was also recorded by a number of countertenors, including Michael Maniaci, Franco Fagioli and .

The autograph manuscript of the motet is preserved in the Jagiellonian Library.

==Structure==

It has four sections:
#Exsultate jubilate – Allegro (F major)
#Fulget amica dies – Secco recitative
#Tu virginum corona – Andante (A major)
#Alleluja – Allegro (F major)

Musicologist Stanley Sadie called the final section, &quot;Alleluia&quot;, &quot;a jewel of a piece with its high spirits and its wit ... like no other piece of Mozart&#x27;s; its music speaks unmistakably of his relaxed high spirits at the time he wrote it and of the elation and confidence that his opera-house success had brought him&quot;.

Although nominally for liturgical use, the motet has many features in common with Mozart&#x27;s concert arias, such as those drawn from his operas. Mozart also used elements of concerto form in this motet.

==Instrumentation==
The motet is scored for soprano solo, 2 oboes (or 2 flutes), bassoon, 2 natural horns in F, organ, 1st and 2nd violins and violas, cello, and double bass.

The occasionally divided viola section gives the orchestra a richer sound. This is something Mozart did more often, for example in his Sinfonia Concertante KV 364 in E-flat major for violin, viola and orchestra.

==Libretto==
Written in Latin, the author of the text is unknown but may have been Rauzzini.
==Revisions==
The text of the first Salzburg version differs in the first and second section.
The second Salzburg version differs from the previous only in the first section.

<text>Vile Parle(, also known as Parla), is a suburb and also the name of the railway station in the Western suburb of Mumbai. Vile Parle has a significantly strong base of Marathi population. It serves as the location of the first Parle factory which ceased operations in the year 2016. It also houses Terminal 2 (T2) of Mumbai&#x27;s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.

==History==
A village named Padale/Padle near Santacruz and Irle near Andheri and the station named Vidlai Padlai led to the name Vile Parle. In this village, there was a huge colony of Christians called Padale. The current southern village region has Bhandar Wada as an independent colony. The old road near Bhandar Wada and Padale joins the Sahar village via bullock carts. Hence there is a railway crossing at Padale.

The Wadias purchased Juhu and Parle. They signed a contractual bond up to 1843. The purpose of selling these 2 villages to Wadia was to increase the population and to increase the amount in the treasury. Wadia had to improve the living conditions in these villages by digging wells, and arranging for food, clothing and shelter in order to attract crowds and sustain a decent population. Wadia used to collect taxes from the villagers and pay them to the government. After him, Shri Barve and Shri Agashe were the chief managers of Wadia Trust.

==Economy==

Vile Parle has now become a second major education centre after Churchgate to Charni Road area. The establishment and growth of a huge educational complex are financed by the Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal and Parle Tilak Vidyalaya Association. Thus, a constant flow of students in and out of Vile Parle can be seen throughout the day.

One of the leading Indian confectionery and biscuit manufacturers, Parle Products was started in Vile Parle. There is still a factory in Vile Parle East and it is commonly known as Parle Biscuit Factory. In July 2016, Parle stopped operations at its Vile Parle manufacturing unit and will be replaced by its corporate office. Vile Parle also houses the Garware plastics factory. Vile Parle is quite famous for its huge number of shops and vendors on the so-called &quot;Market Road&quot;, which is always buzzing with activity.

<text>Yentl is a play by Leah Napolin and Isaac Bashevis Singer.

Based on Singer&#x27;s short story &quot;Yentl the Yeshiva Boy&quot; published in 1962, it centers on a young woman who defies tradition by discussing and debating Jewish law and theology with her rabbi father. When he dies, she cuts her hair, dresses as a man, and sets out to find a yeshiva where she can continue to study Talmud and live secretly as a male named Anshel. When her study partner Avigdor discovers the truth, she is conflicted about pursuing a relationship with him because it will compromise her higher calling. The play focuses on the spiritual equality of women in a segregated Jewish society that does not see women as equals to men, but at the same time prioritizes religion and relationship to God above all else. More generally, the play&#x27;s conflict is between one&#x27;s need for self-actualization and the demands of society as well as one&#x27;s baser desires.

== Production ==
The Broadway production of &quot;Yentl&quot; premiered at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre on October 15, 1975, played eleven previews, opened on October 23, 1975, and ran for 223 performances, concluding on May 2, 1976. It was directed by Robert Kalfin. The cast included Tovah Feldshuh, John Shea, and Lynn Ann Leveridge. It was produced by Cheryl Crawford, Moe Septee, and associate producer Paul B. Berkowsky. Scenic design was by Karl Eigsti, with costumes designed by Carrie F. Robbins, lighting designed by William Mintzer, hair design by Patrick Moreton. The general manager was Paul B. Berkowsky, the company manager was Gino Giglio, the production stage manager was Clint Jakeman, the stage manager was Richard Manheim, and the general press representative was Betty Lee Hunt.

==Screen adaptation==

As early as 1968, Barbra Streisand had expressed interest in a film adaptation of Singer&#x27;s short story. Using the Napolin/Singer play as her source material, she wrote a detailed forty-two page treatment, the first to conceive of the movie version as a musical. The resulting 1983 production veered dramatically from the original short story and play by allowing Yentl to reveal her true feelings for Avigdor and having her return to her female self and sail for the United States at the end.

The film received a scathing review from Singer, who was particularly taken aback by Streisand&#x27;s monopolization of the production to its detriment: 

The film was well received by others, however, including reviewers at &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;. Box office receipts were also healthy, both domestically and internationally, and the film was ranked 19th in the year&#x27;s moneymakers. At awards time, Streisand was snubbed at the Oscars, but the film itself received four nominations, notably winning for Best Original Music Score. &quot;Yentl&quot; won two Golden Globe Awards for Best Director and Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy).

<text>Jeremiah Sullivan Black (January 10, 1810 – August 19, 1883) was an American statesman and lawyer. He served as a justice on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (1851–1857) and as the Court&#x27;s Chief Justice (1851–1854). He also served in the Cabinet of President James Buchanan, first as Attorney General (1857–1860), and then Secretary of State (1860–1861).

==Early life==
Jeremiah S. Black was born on January 10, 1810, in Stony Creek, Pennsylvania, near Dauphin, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Representative Henry Black and Mary (Sullivan) Black. Jeremiah Black was largely self-educated before beginning to study law with Chauncey Forward. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar before he was 21. He gradually became one of the leading American lawyers, and was a member of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court (1851–1857), serving as Chief Justice (1851–1854).

==James Buchanan&#x27;s Cabinet (1857–1861)==
In 1857, he joined the administration of James Buchanan as the Attorney General. In this capacity, he successfully contested the validity of the California land claims to about 19,000 square miles (49,000 km2) of land, fraudulently alleged to have been granted to land-grabbers and others by the Mexican government prior to the close of the Mexican–American War.

When Secretary of State Lewis Cass resigned in December 1860, Black was appointed to replace him, serving from December 17, 1860, to the end of Buchanan&#x27;s term on March 4, 1861. Black successfully urged the appointment of Edwin M. Stanton as his successor as Attorney General.

Black was perhaps the most influential of President Buchanan&#x27;s official advisers too, during the secession crisis. He denied the constitutionality of secession, and urged that Fort Sumter be properly reinforced and defended. However, he argued that a state could not be legally coerced by the Federal government.

On February 5, 1861, President Buchanan nominated him for a seat on the Supreme Court of the United States; but a February 21 motion to proceed to consider the nomination was defeated 25–26, and it lapsed at the end of the 36th Congress. Subsequently, Black was named Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, a position he held for two years. After publishing the reports for 1861 and 1862 (U.S. 66–67), he resigned and devoted himself almost exclusively to his private law practice.

==Later life==
After the Civil War, he vigorously opposed the Congressional plan for Reconstruction and drafted President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s message vetoing the Reconstruction Act passed on March 2, 1867; the veto was overridden. Black was also briefly part of the president&#x27;s defense team at the outset of his 1868 impeachment trial before the United States Senate.

From 1866 to 1868, Black sought U.S. recognition of his clients&#x27; Guano Islands Act claim on Alto Velo Island, which was disputed by the Dominican Republic.

Later, from 1869 to 1876, Black served with Montgomery Blair and Matthew H. Carpenter as Counsel for U.S. Secretary of War William W. Belknap, who in 1876 was impeached on a charge of corruption. Black also represented Samuel J. Tilden during the contest for the presidency between Tilden and Rutherford B. Hayes. He died on August 19, 1883, at the age of 73, and was buried at Prospect Hill Cemetery in York, Pennsylvania.

==Family==
On March 23, 1836, Black married the former Mary Forward. They had four children, Rebekah Black, Chauncey Black, Henry Black, Jr., and Mary Sullivan Black.

<doc id="626563" wikidata="Q445372" url="?curid=626563" title="Robert Bacon">
<text>Robert Bacon (July 5, 1860 – May 29, 1919) was an American athlete, banker, businessman, statesman, diplomat and Republican Party politician who served as the 39th United States Secretary of State in the Theodore Roosevelt administration from January to March 1909. He also served as Assistant Secretary of State from 1905 to 1909 and Ambassador to France from 1909 to 1912.

Bacon was a native of Boston, Massachusetts and attended Harvard College. While a student at Harvard, he starred in athletics, captaining the football team, rowing crew, and winning events in boxing and track. He befriended future president Theodore Roosevelt, leading to a lifelong friendship and professional relationship. After graduation, he became an investment banker with the firm of Lee, Higginson &amp; Co. before joining J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. in New York.

As Secretary of State, Bacon pressed Roosevelt&#x27;s interests in the United States Senate to ratify treaties with Colombia and the new nation of Panama to resolve disputes over the Panama Canal. He continued to advance United States interests in Latin America after leaving office, conducting a tour of the region for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and publishing a treatise arguing for better relations with South America. 

Bacon was a leader in the movement for military preparedness following the outbreak of the First World War, establishing training programs for potential soldiers and officers prior to American entry to the war. In 1916, he narrowly lost the Republican primary for United States Senator from New York to William M. Calder. He was commissioned as a major in the United States Army in 1917 and served under General John Pershing in France. Pershing appointed Bacon to a major role as the chief American liaison to British General Headquarters. Bacon returned to the United States following the war but died from complications following surgery less than two months after his arrival in New York City.

==Early life and family ==

Robert Bacon was born on July 5, 1860, in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, and raised in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston. His father, William Benjamin Bacon, was a Boston merchant who founded Daniel G. Bacon &amp; Company with his elder brother and served as the Boston agent for Baring Brothers. The Bacon family had early colonial roots and settled in the town of Barnstable on Cape Cod. His mother, Emily Crosby Low, was ill for most of his childhood and died when he was eleven years old.

After attending the Hopkinson School in Boston, Bacon was enrolled at Harvard College in 1876, shortly after his sixteenth birthday. At Harvard, he was a star athlete and popular classmate, captaining the football team and freshman baseball team, rowing seven in the crew, winning a heavyweight boxing championship, and winning both the quarter-mile and hundred-yard dash. He was also president of the glee club, chief marshal of his class day celebration, and a member of the A.D. Club and Delta Kappa Epsilon. He graduated as the youngest member of the class of 1880, which included future President Theodore Roosevelt and was called &quot;Bacon&#x27;s class.&quot; Roosevelt and Bacon were close friends and sparring partners during their time at Harvard. Following graduation, he completed a tour of the world, traveling west through Japan, China, India, and the Mediterranean.

== Business career (1881–1905) ==

=== Early career ===
Bacon began his career at the investment bank of Lee, Higginson &amp; Company in Boston; Henry Lee Higginson was a family friend and neighbor on Beacon Hill. In 1883, he accepted an offer to join the firm of E. Rollins Morse, where he handled some of the Boston business of J. P., Morgan.

=== J.P. Morgan &amp; Company (1894–1903) ===

In 1894, Bacon accepted an offer to become a partner in J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. in New York City, cancelling plans to relocate to France for his children&#x27;s education. He would remain with the firm until his resignation in 1903. As a junior partner to J. P. Morgan, he was one of the most trusted lieutenants in the firm and often led the American business while Morgan was in Europe.

==== Panic of 1893 ====

Bacon referred to his early months at J.P. Morgan as &quot;really working for perhaps the first time in my life,&quot; as the firm was engaged in Morgan&#x27;s plan to restore the credit of the United States government following the Panic of 1893. 

On February 5, 1895, he and Morgan met with President Grover Cleveland at the White House, where Morgan urged the private sale of government bonds in exchange for gold to an international syndicate represented by J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. At the time, the United States Treasury was the subject of a bank run and on the verge of exhausting its gold reserves. Morgan prevailed upon Cleveland to agree to the private placement, in which Morgan&#x27;s bank would act as representative of an international syndicate to supply sufficient gold. Although Congress failed to pass a bill explicitly granting Cleveland the authority to make such a sale, he finalized the agreement with Morgan on February 8, avoiding the suspension of payments. 

The deal was politically controversial for all involved, but Bacon&#x27;s role in managing the transaction earned him appreciation from Morgan; in the future, Bacon would manage all of Morgan&#x27;s American business while the latter was in Europe.

==== United States Steel Corporation ====

In 1898, Bacon took on the firm&#x27;s work for the newly formed Federal Steel Corporation, a steel conglomerate with over $100 million (approximately $ in ) in capital. Elbert Henry Gary, a Chicago lawyer who served as president of Federal Steel, hired Morgan to finance further acquisitions by the firm, with a particular interest in the holdings of Andrew Carnegie. Negotiations between Morgan and Charles M. Schwab, the president of Carnegie Steel, began December 12, 1898, and concluded in 1901 for $487 million, an unheard-of sum for the time. The sale of the Carnegie interests resulted in the consolidation of the new United States Steel Corporation, valued at over 1.38 billion dollars and controlling two-thirds of the American steel industry.

==== Northern Securities Company ====

In 1901, Bacon oversaw the consolidation of Morgan&#x27;s vast railroad interests with those of James J. Hill in the Great Northern Railway and their joint acquisition of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad. The latter acquisition was opposed by E. H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad; Harriman demanded a one-third interest in the acquisition and when refused, attempted (with Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.) a hostile takeover of Morgan&#x27;s Northern Pacific Railway; Bacon led the takeover defense. The resulting inflation in the price of Northern Pacific stock, which rose rapidly to over $1,000 per share of common stock in May 1901, threatened to crash the New York Stock Exchange. The ensuing financial panic led to the ruin of many small investors.

To resolve the takeover bid and complete the planned consolidation of the Morgan and Hill railways, an investment company named the Northern Securities Company was formed on November 13, and stock in the three railroads (the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific, and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy) in exchange for new issues of its equity. Harriman was named to the board of directors of the Northern Pacific and the Burlington, ending the takeover bid and calming the markets.

However, an antitrust suit was immediately brought by the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota against the Northern Securities Company under the Sherman Antitrust Act. Bacon was named as a defendant in the suit, which challenged the right of Northern Securities to own stock in the Northern Pacific and Great Northern. The case was decided against the company (including Bacon), and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States by a 5–4 vote, dissolving the Northern Securities Company and returning the railroad stock to its owners. As a result of the stress from the Northern Securities case, Bacon took a one-year leave of absence in 1903 before retiring from J. P. Morgan.

== Diplomatic career (1905–1912) ==

=== Assistant Secretary of State (1905–09) ===
On September 5, 1905, Bacon accepted an appointment from President Theodore Roosevelt, his former Harvard classmate, to serve as United States Assistant Secretary of State. The appointment had been requested by the new Secretary of State, Elihu Root.

As Assistant Secretary, Bacon&#x27;s work focused on relations with Canada and Latin America and advancing Roosevelt&#x27;s Pan-American policy. He was sent to negotiate the arbitration of the Newfoundland fisheries dispute by the Hague with James Bryce; following Bacon&#x27;s death, Bryce remarked, &quot;How often have I recalled the work we did together for furthering friendship and good relations between America and England, and how pleasant it was to deal with him.&quot; From July 4 through September 30, 1906, Bacon served as acting Secretary of State while Root was in Rio de Janeiro to attend the Pan-American Conference. During his time as acting secretary, Bacon advised Roosevelt on the outbreak of hostilities between Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, cautioning against unilateral intervention in favor of a bilateral intervention with Mexico. An armistice was quickly declared with joint American and Mexican oversight. He also successfully negotiated the basis of a settlement of debt owed by the Dominican Republic and the return of land in Puerto Rico to the Catholic Church.

==== Provisional Government of Cuba ====
The most pressing matter during Bacon&#x27;s tenure as acting secretary was a rebellion leading to the collapse of the Republic of Cuba, an independent state established by the United States following a period of American military government. In response to appeals by President Tomás Estrada Palma, Bacon and Secretary of War William Howard Taft personally departed Washington on September 16 for a mission to Cuba, in order to negotiate peace with the rebels against Palma&#x27;s government. Despite the American mission, no peace was reached; Taft accordingly issued a proclamation on September 29, 1906, establishing the Provisional Government of Cuba by the United States and proclaiming himself Provisional Governor. Taft and Bacon remained in Cuba until October 15, when administration of the island was handed to Charles Edward Magoon.

Though Bacon had been involved in deliberations over the Provisional Government, he privately expressed reservations over Taft&#x27;s policy, which he believed was contrary to Root&#x27;s foreign policy and to Root&#x27;s earlier policy as Secretary of War, including the organization of the government and drafting of the new Cuban constitution.

=== Secretary of State (1909) ===
In January 1909, Elihu Root was elected to represent New York in the U.S. Senate, and Bacon was nominated to succeed him as Secretary of State on January 25. He was confirmed by the Senate and sworn into office on January 27, thirty-eight days before the end of Roosevelt&#x27;s term in office and the inauguration of William Howard Taft as president. Taft appointed Philander C. Knox to succeed him as secretary. 

Less than three weeks before Bacon&#x27;s nomination, the United States had entered into treaties with Colombia and Panama to settle disputes relating to the separation of Panama. The Colombian treaty was approved by the Senate on February 24. Bacon spent much of his term as secretary urging the approval of the Panama treaty, which was finally approved on March 3, the day before Roosevelt&#x27;s term in office expired. However, the treaties were rejected in Colombia, where their introduction despite widespread anti-American sentiment led to a revolution and the resignation of President Rafael Reyes. 

Bacon directed American participation in the London Naval Conference through February 1909, where American delegates proposed to invest a new International Prize Court with permanent jurisdiction as a court of international justice. Great Britain joined the United States in urging this proposal; however, the Conference rejected the proposal for enlarged jurisdiction, and the London Declaration was never ratified by any of its signatories. In February, Bacon also personally served as a delegate to the North American Conservation Conference with Canada and Mexico, where the attendees resolved to establish a global conference for the conservation of natural resources. 

=== Ambassador to France (1909–12) ===
Bacon served as United States Ambassador to France under President Taft from 1909 until 1912. Historian James Brown Scott remarked, &quot;There was nothing eventful in Mr. Bacon&#x27;s ambassadorship.&quot; 

Upon his arrival, Bacon focused on securing relief aid for the Great Flood of Paris. In April 1910, he hosted Theodore Roosevelt on the latter&#x27;s return from an African safari. During the visit, Roosevelt delivered his famous Citizenship in a Republic speech at the Sorbonne. He continued to develop ties to Latin American colleagues in France, hosting an annual celebration for these countries on George Washington&#x27;s birthday, at which he emphasized the similarities between Washington, Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín.

Bacon submitted his resignation as Ambassador on January 2, 1912, upon his election as a Fellow of Harvard University. He remained in office until Myron Herrick was nominated as his successor. Bacon and his family remained in Paris to brief Herrick on the diplomatic situation, causing them to cancel their planned trip on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

== World War I ==
In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I in Europe, Bacon went to France to help with the work of the American Field Service – which provided ambulances and drivers to support French and British forces. He was also attached to the British Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and assisted with the establishment of a typhoid hospital near Ypres. His book &quot;For Better Relations with Our Latin American Neighbors&quot; was published in 1915.

He was a staunch advocate of the United States&#x27; entry into World War I and spoke in favor of increased military preparedness via universal military service as the president of the National Security League in 1916. He criticized President Woodrow Wilson for inaction at the German invasion of Belgium and sought the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate against William M. Calder. Bacon continued to push for a stronger national defense as well as a protective tariff that could be used for the mobilization of industry in case of war. Although he had support from former president Theodore Roosevelt and Elihu Root, Bacon lost the race by about 9,000 votes and pledged to support Calder. He was named as the candidate of the American Party but withdrew on account of his pledge to Calder.

He was then commissioned as a major in the United States Army in May 1917, one month after the American entry into World War I, before sailing to France as a member of the staff of Major General John J. &quot;Blackjack&quot; Pershing, who was made commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). Bacon was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1918 and served as chief of the American military mission at British General Headquarters working with the British commander, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commanding the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. He returned to the United States in April 1919, five months after the war ended due to the Armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918.

== Personal life, death and legacy ==
Bacon married Martha Waldron Cowdin on October 10, 1883. They had four children: 

* Robert Low Bacon, a United States Representative from New York;
* Gaspar Griswold Bacon, President of the Massachusetts Senate (1929–32) and Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts (1933–35);
* Elliot Cowdin Bacon; and
* Martha Beatrix Bacon (1890–1967) who married George Whitney (1885–1963).

Bacon died at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary on May 29, 1919, from blood poisoning after undergoing surgery on his mastoiditis.

A sculpture entitled &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; was made by Malvina Hoffman as a memorial to the Bacon and alumni of Harvard University who lost their lives during World War I. In it, the head of a 13th-century crusader lay on the lap of a draped woman. The sculpture was dedicated in 1923 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. After the War Memorial Chapel at Harvard was completed in 1932, it was installed there.

<text>Caesars Superdome (originally the Louisiana Superdome and formerly the Mercedes-Benz Superdome), commonly known as the Superdome, is a domed multi-purpose stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. It is the home stadium of the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL).

Plans to build the Superdome were drawn up in 1967 by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of Curtis and Davis and the building opened as the Louisiana Superdome in 1975. Its steel frame covers a expanse and the dome is made of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of , making it the largest fixed domed structure in the world.

The Superdome has hosted eight Super Bowls and Six NCAA championships in men&#x27;s college basketball. In college football, the Sugar Bowl has been played at the Superdome since 1975, which is one of the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Six&quot; bowl games of the College Football Playoff and the 2020 National Championship. It also traditionally hosts the Bayou Classic, a rivalry game played between the historically black colleges and universities Southern University and Grambling State University. The Superdome was also the long-time home of the Tulane Green Wave football team of Tulane University until 2014 (when they returned on-campus at Yulman Stadium), and was the home venue of the New Orleans Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1975 until 1979.

In 2005, the Superdome housed thousands of people seeking shelter from Hurricane Katrina. The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm, and was closed for many months afterward. The building was fully refurbished and reopened in time for the Saints&#x27; 2006 home opener on September 25.

==History==

===Planning===
Local businessman David Dixon (who later founded the United States Football League in the 1980s) conceived of the Superdome while attempting to convince the NFL to award a franchise to New Orleans. After hosting several exhibition games at Tulane Stadium during typical New Orleans summer thunderstorms, Dixon was told by NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle that the NFL would never expand into New Orleans without a domed stadium. Dixon then won the support of the governor of Louisiana, John McKeithen. When they toured the Astrodome in Houston, Texas in 1966, McKeithen was quoted as saying, &quot;I want one of these, only bigger&quot;, in reference to the Astrodome itself. Bonds were passed for construction of the Superdome on November 8, 1966, seven days after commissioner Pete Rozelle awarded New Orleans the 25th professional football franchise.

The stadium was conceptualized to be a multifunctional stadium for football, baseball and basketball—with moveable field level stands that would be arranged specifically for each sport and areas with dirt (for the bases and pitchers mound) covered with metal plates on the stadium floor (they were covered by the artificial turf during football games)—and there are also meeting rooms that could be rented for many different purposes. Dixon imagined the possibilities of staging simultaneous high school football games side by side and suggested that the synthetic surface be white. Blount International of Montgomery, Alabama was chosen to build the stadium.

As the dome was being constructed, various individuals developed eccentric models of the structure: one was of sugar, another consisted of pennies. The so-called &quot;penny model&quot; traveled to the Philadelphia Bicentennial &#x27;76 exhibition. New Orleanian Norman J. Kientz built the model with 2,697 pennies and donated it to the Superdome Board of Commissioners in April 1974.

It was hoped the stadium would be ready in time for the 1972 NFL season, and the final cost of the facility would come in at $46 million. Instead, due to political delays, construction did not start until August 11, 1971, and was not finished until August 1975, seven months after Super Bowl IX was scheduled to be played in the stadium. Since the stadium was not finished in time for the Super Bowl, the game had to be moved to Tulane Stadium, and was played in cold and rainy conditions. Factoring in inflation, construction delays, and the increase in transportation costs caused by the 1973 oil crisis, the final price tag of the stadium skyrocketed to $165 million. Along with the state police, Elward Thomas Brady, Jr., a state representative from Terrebonne Parish and a New Orleans native, conducted an investigation into possible financial irregularities, but the Superdome went forward despite the obstacles.

===Early history (1975–2004)===
The New Orleans Saints moved into the Superdome in 1975; the home opener on September 28 was a 21–0 shutout loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in the first regular-season game in the facility. Tulane Stadium, the original home of the Saints, was condemned for destruction on the day the Superdome opened.

The first Super Bowl played in the stadium was Super Bowl XII in January 1978, the first in prime time.

The original artificial turf playing surface in the Superdome was produced and developed by Monsanto (which made the first artificial playing surface for sports, AstroTurf) specifically for the Superdome, and was named &quot;Mardi Grass&quot;.

The Superdome replaced the first generation &quot;Mardi Grass&quot; surface to the next-generation infilled FieldTurf midway through the 2003 season on November 16.

=== Shelter of last resort during Hurricane Katrina ===
The Superdome was used as a &quot;shelter of last resort&quot; for those in New Orleans unable to evacuate from Hurricane Katrina when it struck on August 29, 2005. During the storm, a large section of the outer covering was peeled off by high winds. The photos of the damage, in which the concrete underneath was exposed, quickly became an iconic image of Hurricane Katrina. A few days later, the dome was closed until September 25, 2006.

By August 31, there had been three deaths in the Superdome: two elderly medical patients and a man who is believed to have committed suicide by jumping from the upper-level seats. There were also unconfirmed reports of rape, vandalism, violent assaults, crack dealing/drug abuse, and gang activity inside the Superdome. After a National Guardsman was attacked and shot in the dark by an assailant, the National Guard inside the Superdome used barbed wire barricades to separate themselves from the other people in the dome. On September 11, New Orleans Police Superintendent Eddie Compass reported there were &quot;no confirmed reports of any type of sexual assault.&quot;

United States Navy sniper Chris Kyle claimed that during the hurricane, he and another sniper climbed to the top of the dome and killed 30 armed looters during the chaos following the event. This claim has never been independently verified, and there is no evidence of dozens of people being slain by a sniper or gunman, with commentary noting that it would be unlikely that 30 people would have been killed without anyone noticing it or reporting it to the media or the police. Kyle&#x27;s story had been reported in a number of publications, including the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, with Kyle relating the story to other military personnel.
The Superdome cost $185 million to repair and refurbish. To repair the Superdome, FEMA put up $115 million, the state spent $13 million, the Louisiana Stadium &amp; Exposition District refinanced a bond package to secure $41 million and the NFL contributed $15 million.

After being damaged from the flooding disaster, a new Sportexe MomentumTurf surface was installed for the 2006 season.

On Super Bowl XL on February 5, 2006, the NFL announced that the Saints would play their home opener on September 24, 2006 in the Superdome against the Atlanta Falcons. The game was later moved to September 25.

The reopening of the dome was celebrated with festivities including a free outdoor concert by the Goo Goo Dolls before fans were allowed in, a pre-game performance by U2 and Green Day performing a cover of the Skids&#x27; &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot;, and a coin toss conducted by then-President George W. Bush. In front of ESPN&#x27;s largest-ever audience at that time, the Saints won the game 23–3 with 70,003 in attendance, and went on to a successful season, reaching their first ever NFC Championship Game.

=== 2008–present ===

====Further renovations====

In 2008, new windows were installed to bring natural light into the building. Later that year, the roof-facing of the Superdome was also remodeled, restoring the roof with a solid white hue. Between 2009 and 2010, the entire outer layer of the stadium, more than of aluminum siding, was replaced with new aluminum panels and insulation, returning the building to its original champagne bronze colored exterior. An innovative barrier system for drainage was also added, allowing the dome to resemble its original facade.

In addition, escalators were added to the outside of the club rooms. Each suite includes modernized rooms with raised ceilings, leather sofas, and flat-screen TVs, as well as glass brushed aluminum and wood-grain furnishings. A new $600,000 point-of-sale system was also installed, allowing fans to purchase concessions with credit cards throughout the stadium for the first time.

During the summer of 2010, the Superdome installed of the UBU Speed S5-M synthetic turf system, an Act Global brand. In 2017 Act Global installed a new turf in time for the NFL season. For the 2018, 2019, and 2020 NFL seasons, Turf Nation Inc located in Dalton, Georgia, have supplied the synthetic turf system for the Superdome. The Superdome has, as of 2017, the largest continuous synthetic turf system in the NFL.

Beginning in 2011, demolition and new construction began to the lower bowl of the stadium, reconfiguring it to increase seating by 3,500, widening the plaza concourse, building two bunker club lounges and adding additional concession stands. Crews tore down the temporary stairs that led from Champions Square to the Dome, and replaced them with permanent steps. Installation of express elevators that take coaches and media from the ground level of the stadium to the press box were also completed. New bunker lounges on each side of the stadium were built. The lounges are equipped with flat-screen TVs, granite counter tops and full-service bars. These state-of-the-art lounges can serve 4,500 fans, whose old plaza seats were upgraded to premium tickets, giving those fans leather chairs with cup-holders. The plaza level was extended, closing in space between the concourse and plaza seating, adding new restrooms and concession areas. The renovations also ended the stadium&#x27;s ability to convert to a baseball configuration. The renovations were completed in late June 2011 in time for the Essence Music Festival.

==== Naming rights ====
Naming rights to the Superdome were sold for the first time in 2011 to automaker Mercedes-Benz, renaming the facility Mercedes-Benz Superdome. Mercedes-Benz did not renew the contract, and in July 2021 it was announced that the naming rights would be sold to Caesars Entertainment, under which it was renamed Caesars Superdome.

==== Statue ====
On July 27, 2012, a statue was unveiled at a plaza next to the Superdome. The work, titled &quot;Rebirth&quot;, depicts one of the most famous plays in Saints history—Steve Gleason&#x27;s block of a Michael Koenen punt that the Saints recovered for a touchdown early in the first quarter of the team&#x27;s first post-Katrina game in the Superdome.

==== Super Bowl XLVII power failure ====
The Superdome hosted the Super Bowl XLVII football game on February 3, 2013. A partial power failure halted game play for about 34 minutes in the third quarter between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers. It caused CBS, who was broadcasting the game, to lose some of its cameras as well as voiceovers by commentators Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. At no point did the game go off the air, though the game had no audio for about two minutes. While the lights were coming back on, sideline reporter Steve Tasker reported on the outage as a breaking news situation until power was restored enough for play to continue.

On February 8, 2013, it was reported that a relay device intended to prevent an electrical overload had caused the failure. The device was located in an electrical vault owned and operated by Entergy, the electrical utility for the New Orleans area. That vault is approximately away from the Superdome. A subsequent report from an independent auditor confirmed the relay device as the cause. The Superdome&#x27;s own power system was never compromised.

==== End zone scoreboards and new lighting ====
During the 2016 off-season, the smaller videoboards formerly located along the end zone walls above the upper seating bowl were replaced with two large Panasonic HD LED displays that stretch wide and tall that are much easier to see throughout the bowl. Other upgrades included a complete upgrade to the Superdome&#x27;s interior floodlighting system to an efficient LED system with programmable coloring, light show effects, and instant on-off; in normal mode the stadium will have a more vibrant and naturally pleasing system resembling natural daylight.

==== Current renovations ====

In November 2019, phase one plans were approved by the Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District, commonly known as the Superdome Commission, for a $450 million renovation. The renovation, designed by Trahan Architects (founded by Victor F. &quot;Trey&quot; Trahan III, FAIA), included atriums that replaced the ramp system, improved concourses, and field-level end zone boxes. The first phase of work began January 2020 and included installing alternative exits and constructing a large kitchen and food-service area.

==== 2021 roof fire ====
On September 21, 2021, thick black smoke was seen rising from the top of the Superdome while renovations and maintenance were underway by workers on the roof. One person was injured in the blaze that initially started when a pressure washer caught fire. Firefighters brought the fire under control within an hour. No structural damage occurred to the building, and future events were not impacted.

The Superdome is located on of land, near the former Girod Street Cemetery. The dome has an interior space of , a height of , a dome diameter of , and a total floor area of .

===Capacity===
The Superdome has a listed football seating capacity of 76,468 (expanded) or 73,208 (not expanded) and a maximum basketball seating capacity of 73,432. However, published attendance figures from events such as the Super Bowl football game have exceeded 79,000. The basketball capacity does not reflect the NCAA&#x27;s new policy on arranging the basketball court on the 50-yard line on the football field, per 2009 NCAA policy. In 2011, 3,500 seats were added, increasing the Superdome&#x27;s capacity to 76,468. The Superdome&#x27;s capacity was 78,133 for WrestleMania 34. In 2021, 4,300 seats were removed, with the goal of improving the fan experience by widening concourses, adding quick-service concessions, and building larger elevators and escalators.

The chronology of the capacity for football is as follows:
==Notable events==

===American football===

The Superdome&#x27;s primary tenant is the NFL&#x27;s New Orleans Saints. The team regularly draws capacity crowds.

The NFL has hosted eight Super Bowls at the Superdome, most recently Super Bowl LIX in 2025.

The 1976 Pro Bowl was held at the Superdome on Monday, January 26, 1976. It was the NFL&#x27;s 26th annual all-star game.

The Bowl Championship Series National Championship Games were played at the Superdome four times. The College Football Playoff semifinal game is played every three years in the stadium. The CFP national championship game was played at the stadium once (and will return in 2028). Two other bowl games are also played there annually: the Sugar Bowl and New Orleans Bowl. The stadium also now hosts the Louisiana Kickoff. Florida State was victorious 24–23 over LSU in the first matchup of the inaugural kickoff.

The Superdome also hosts the Bayou Classic, an annual rivalry classic between the state&#x27;s two largest historically black colleges and universities, Grambling State and Southern. Tulane University played their home games at the stadium from 1975 to 2013 (except 2005) before moving to on-campus Yulman Stadium.

In 2013, the Arena Football League New Orleans VooDoo played their last six home games of the season at the stadium. From 1991 to 1992, the New Orleans Night of the AFL played at the stadium.

The annual Louisiana Prep Classic state championship football games organized by the Louisiana High School Athletic Association have been held at the Superdome since 1981, except in 2005 following the extreme damage of Hurricane Katrina (moved to Independence Stadium in Shreveport) and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic (moved to Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana). The first state championship game in the stadium matched New Orleans Catholic League powers St. Augustine and Jesuit on December 15, 1978. The Purple Knights won their second Class AAAA title in four seasons by ousting the Blue Jays, 13–7, in front of over 42,000 fans.

====Home field advantage====
Since the Superdome&#x27;s reopening in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the increased success of the New Orleans Saints, the Superdome has developed a reputation for having a very strong home field advantage. While all domed stadiums possess this quality to some degree, the Superdome is known to be extremely loud during games, especially during offensive drives by the visiting team.

During a pregame interview before the Minnesota Vikings&#x27; opening game of the 2010 NFL season against the Saints, Brett Favre, reflecting on the Vikings&#x27; loss to the Saints in the 2009 NFC Championship Game, said of the Superdome: &quot;That was, by far, the most hostile environment I&#x27;ve ever been in. You couldn&#x27;t hear anything.&quot; It was during that loss that some of the Vikings players elected to wear earplugs, including Favre. It was the first game of the season that they had chosen to do so.

===Baseball===
When the plaza level seats remained moveable, the capacity for baseball was 63,525 and the field size was as follows: to both left field and right field, to both left-center field and right-center field, to center field, and to the backstop. The bowl was reconfigured in a renovation from 2006 to 2011, which replaced the moveable seats with a pre-cast concrete deck and moved the seating closer to the field, creating 3,500 new seats in the lower bowl. This made the bowl more suitable for football, but less accommodating for baseball.

The first baseball game in the Superdome was an exhibition between the Minnesota Twins and the Houston Astros on April 6, 1976.

Superdome officials pursued negotiations with Oakland Athletics officials during the 1978–79 baseball off-season about moving the Athletics to the Superdome. The Athletics were unable to break their lease at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and remained in Oakland. Superdome officials met with the Pittsburgh Pirates in April 1981 about moving the club to New Orleans when the Pirates were unhappy with their lease at Three Rivers Stadium.

In the mid-1990s, the Superdome was planned to be the home of the yet-to-be named New Orleans team, a charter franchise of the United League (UL) which was a planned third league of Major League Baseball (MLB) that never came to fruition.

====Minor League Baseball====
The American Association New Orleans Pelicans played at the Superdome during the 1977 season. The Pelicans&#x27; season attendance was 217,957 at the dome.

====Major League Baseball exhibitions====
The Minnesota Twins and the Houston Astros played an exhibition game on April 6, 1976. The New York Yankees played exhibition games at the Superdome in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983. The Yankees hosted the Baltimore Orioles on March 15 and 16, 1980. 45,152 spectators watched the Yankees beat the Orioles 9–3 on March 15, 1980. The following day, 43,339 fans saw Floyd Rayford lead the Orioles to a 7–1 win over the Yankees. In 1981, the Yankees played the New York Mets, Philadelphia Philles and Pittsburgh Pirates in the dome. In 1982, the Yankees played the Montreal Expos and Texas Rangers and late in 1982, the Yankees considered opening the 1983 regular season at the Superdome if Yankee Stadium would not be ready yet after renovations. The 1983 New York Yankees also played the Montreal Expos and Toronto Blue Jays in the Superdome that year. The Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals closed the 1984 spring training season with two games at the dome on March 31, 1984, and April 1, 1984. In what was a preview of the 1989 World Series, the Oakland A&#x27;s played the San Francisco Giants in two games on March 28–29, 1989. In 1991, the Los Angeles Dodgers played the Oakland A&#x27;s in two games on March 22–23, 1991. The A&#x27;s also played the New York Mets in two contests on March 26–27, 1993. In 1994, the Boston Red Sox played the New York Yankees in two games on April 1–2, 1994. The last professional baseball games played in the Superdome occurred on April 3–4, 1999, when the Chicago Cubs and Minnesota Twins played a two-game series dubbed the &quot;New Orleans Major League Baseball Classic.&quot;

====Busch Challenge/Winn-Dixie Showdown====
The Busch Challenge/Winn-Dixie Showdown was a college baseball tournament held in the Superdome from 1987 to 1999. LSU, Tulane and University of New Orleans played an in-state team and out-of-state teams from Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas in the annual tournament. The in-state team was Louisiana-Lafayette. The out-of-state teams were Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, Cal State Fullerton, Duke, Florida, Florida State, Georgia, Georgia Southern, Georgia Tech, Houston, Lamar, Miami (FL), Mississippi State, NC State, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Ole Miss, Oral Roberts, South Alabama, Southern California, Southern Mississippi, Texas A&amp;M, UCLA.

===Basketball===
The NCAA has hosted the Men&#x27;s Final Four at the Superdome six times in 1982, 1987, 1993, 2003, 2012, and 2022. The 1982 final between the
University of North Carolina and Georgetown University featured 15 lead changes before a young Michael Jordan hit the game winning shot to put North Carolina ahead for good at the end of the game. The game is considered by many to be one of the greatest college basketball games ever played, while also introducing Jordan to a national audience. The stadium hosted regional semifinals and finals in 1981 and 1990, as well as first- and second-round games in 1999 and 2001. The 2012 and 2022 editions were hosted with a full-stadium setup with center court resting where midfield at the 50-yard line is, with previous Final Fours having varied setups with some sections blocked off and obstructive temporary seating.

The NBA&#x27;s New Orleans Jazz used the Superdome as their home court, from 1975 to 1979. In 1977, the Jazz set a then-record in attendance for an NBA game, with 35,077 watching the Jazz led by Pete &quot;Pistol Pete&quot; Maravich against the Philadelphia 76ers, led by fellow future Hall of Famer Julius Erving. The 2017 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, a part of that year&#x27;s All-Star Weekend, was hosted in the Superdome with half the venue curtained off.

Tulane used the Superdome as its primary home court from its opening in 1975 through 1982. It played occasional games there in the 1990s against high-profile opponents before the opening of the New Orleans Arena (now the Smoothie King Center) in 1999.

In 1996, the stadium hosted the AAU Junior Olympics basketball competition.

===Boxing===
On October 14, 1975, the Dome hosted Muhammad Ali Appreciation Day. The Muhammad Temple of Islam 46 in New Orleans organized the activities, with Ali&#x27;s appearance as the day&#x27;s highlight. Speakers included Dr. Na&#x27;im Akbar, Wallace D. Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan.

The Superdome hosted the September 15, 1978 fight some called the Ali rematch where Muhammad Ali won the world Heavyweight title for the third time by beating Leon Spinks in front of a crowd of 65,000. It was Ali&#x27;s last professional win.

Leonard–Durán II, also known as the &quot;No Más Fight&quot;, took place on November 25, 1980, at the Louisiana Superdome. In the match, Sugar Ray Leonard defeated Roberto Durán to regain the WBC Welterweight Championship. The match gained its famous appellation in the end of the eighth round when Durán turned away from Leonard, towards the referee and quit by saying &quot;No más&quot; (Spanish for &quot;No more&quot;).

On December 3, 1982, the Superdome hosted the Carnival of Champions. In the first of two co-main events, Wilfredo Gómez of Puerto Rico would defend his WBC world Jr Featherweight championship against WBC&#x27;s world Bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor of Mexico. In the second, Wilfred Benítez defended his WBC world Jr Middleweight championship against the former WBA Welterweight champion of the world Thomas Hearns. Gomez beat Pintor by fourteenth-round technical knockout in a fight that has been considered among the greatest of all times between Mexicans and Puerto Ricans and the greatest fight at the Super Bantamweight division while Hearns beat Benitez by fifteen-rounds majority decision.

===Gymnastics===
The USSR National Gymnastics Team performed for the first time in Louisiana in 1976. The Superdome event featured Olga Korbut, Nelli Kim, Nicolai Andrianov and Alexander Dityatin.

At the 1995 U.S. Gymnastics National Championships, Dominique Moceanu became the youngest Women&#x27;s All-Around National Champion in U.S. history at 13 years old, a record that still stands. John Roethlisberger also won his fourth and final U.S. Men&#x27;s All-Around National Championship.

In 1996, the stadium hosted the AAU Junior Olympics gymnastics competition.

===Motocross===
The Superdome hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round from 1977 to 1980, 1998 to 2002, 2009 and 2012. On June 4, 1977, 40,000 fans watched Jimmy Weinert win the sixth of 12 races for a $250,000 purse. of dirt were piled into the center of the Superdome for the event.

===Rugby union===

The match was organized by RugbyLaw, organizers of the National Rugby Football League. The match was cancelled, however, as USA Rugby, the governing body of the sport in the United States, refused to approve the artificial turf playing surface.

===Soccer===
The Superdome&#x27;s first soccer matches occurred on September 5, 1976. In a doubleheader, two local club teams (Costa Rica and Olympia) squared off, followed by a post-season North American Soccer League matchup between the New York Cosmos and the Dallas Tornado. Pelé and Kyle Rote, Jr. led their respective teams, but it was Werner Roth and Ramon Mifflin who notched goals for New York in the Cosmos&#x27; 2–1 victory.

<text>Jean-Claude Raoul Olivier Risset (; 13 March 1938 – 21 November 2016) was a French composer, best known for his pioneering contributions to computer music. He was a former student of André Jolivet and former co-worker of Max Mathews at Bell Labs.

== Biography ==
Risset was born in Le Puy-en-Velay, France. Arriving at Bell Labs, New Jersey in 1964, he used Max Mathews&#x27; MUSIC IV software to digitally recreate the sounds of brass instruments. He made digital recordings of trumpets and studied their timbral composition using &quot;pitch-synchronous&quot; spectrum analysis tools, revealing that the amplitude and frequency of the harmonics (more correctly, partials) of these instruments would differ depending on frequency, duration and amplitude. He is also credited with performing the first experiments on a range of synthesis techniques including FM synthesis and waveshaping.

After the discrete Shepard scale Risset created a version of the scale where the steps between each tone are continuous, and it is appropriately called the continuous Risset scale or Shepard-Risset glissando.

Risset also created a similar effect with rhythm in which tempo seems to increase or decrease endlessly.
Risset was the head of the Computer Department at IRCAM (1975–1979). At MIT Media Labs, he composed the first Duet for one pianist (1989). For his work in computer music and his 70 compositions, he received the first Golden Nica (Ars Electronica Prize, 1987), the Giga-Hertz Grand Prize 2009, and the highest French awards in both music (Grand Prix National de la Musique, 1990) and science (Gold Medal, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1999). and in art (René Dumesnil Prize from the French Academy of Fine Arts, 2011).

Risset died in Marseille on 21 November 2016.

<text>War Child is the seventh studio album by Jethro Tull, released in October 1974. It was released almost a year and a half after the release of &quot;A Passion Play&quot;. The turmoil over criticism of the previous album surrounded the production of &quot;War Child&quot;, which obliged the band to do press conferences and explain their plans for the future.

==Recording==

The band began recording songs for the album on 7 December 1973, starting with &quot;Ladies&quot;. They recorded &quot;The Third Hoorah&quot; along with the outtake &quot;Paradise Steakhouse&quot; on 8 December, &quot;War Child&quot; and &quot;Back-Door Angels&quot; along with the outtake &quot;Saturation&quot; on 16 December, the sound effects from &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Ladies&quot;, &quot;Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day&quot; and &quot;The Third Hoorah&quot; along with the outtake &quot;Good Godmother&quot; and the orchestral piece &quot;Mime Sequence&quot; on 19 December, &quot;Sea Lion&quot; along with the outtake &quot;Sea Lion II&quot; on 6 January 1974, &quot;Queen and Country&quot; on 20 January 1974 and finally &quot;Two Fingers&quot; and &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot; along with the outtake &quot;Tomorrow was Today&quot; on 24 February 1974. The whole album was recorded at Morgan Studios, in London, except for tracks 6 and 8, which were recorded at the Château d&#x27;Hérouville, in France. According to the liner notes on the 2014 Theatre Edition reissue, &quot;War Child&quot; was a much more relaxed record to make, compared to the previous album and the Château d&#x27;Hérouville sessions. The studio equipment worked, the sound in the studio was very workable, and the atmosphere within the band was very settled and productive. &quot;Only Solitaire&quot; and &quot;Skating Away&quot; were recorded earlier, as detailed below.

==Music==
Some of the music derived from past recording sessions of the band. &quot;Only Solitaire&quot; and &quot;Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day&quot; were left over from the summer 1972 writing sessions for what was to have been the follow-up to &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (1972). The basic tracks and lead vocals for those two songs were recorded during September 1972 sessions in France. &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot; also shares some elements with material recorded in September 1972. Ian Anderson told Songfacts: &quot;It was actually late &#x27;72 or early &#x27;73 when I was in Paris recording an album that never got released, although one or two of the tracks made it out in 1974, but that was at a time when I was writing an album that was exploring people, the human condition, through analogies with the animal kingdom.&quot; &quot;Two Fingers&quot; is a rearrangement of &quot;Lick Your Fingers Clean&quot;, a track from the &quot;Aqualung&quot; (1971) recording sessions that was not included on that album&#x27;s original release.

==Film==
Originally meant to accompany a film project (the album was planned as a double-album set), it was reinstated as a ten-song, single-length rock album after failed attempts to find a major movie studio to finance the film. The &quot;War Child&quot; movie was written as a metaphysical black comedy concerning a teenage girl in the afterlife, meeting characters based on God, St. Peter and Lucifer portrayed as shrewd businessmen. Notable British actor Leonard Rossiter was to have been featured, Margot Fonteyn was to have choreographed, while Monty Python veteran John Cleese was pencilled in as a &quot;humour consultant&quot;.

==Packaging==
The front cover is a composite photograph featuring a positive colour print of Melbourne at night, and a negative print of a studio photo of lead singer Ian Anderson. The back cover of the album contains images of people, including the five members of the band, friends, wives, girlfriends, Chrysalis Records staff, and manager Terry Ellis, all related to the song titles. Anderson&#x27;s personal touring assistant (and future wife) Shona Learoyd appears as a ringmaster, while Terry Ellis appears as a leopard skin-clad, umbrella-waving aggressive businessman.

==Music style and themes==
The album prominently features Dee Palmer&#x27;s string orchestration across an eclectic musical set, with the band members, as the two predecessor albums, playing a multitude of instruments. The music is lighter and more whimsical than the dark &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, with hints of comedy in the lyrics and the music&#x27;s structure, although the lyrics still unleash lashing critiques of established society (as in &quot;Queen and Country&quot; and &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot;), religion (&quot;Two Fingers&quot;) and critics (&quot;Only Solitaire&quot;).

==Critical reception==

The 1974 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of the album is very harsh, as was the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of &quot;A Passion Play&quot;: &quot;Each handcrafted track comes chock-full of schmaltz, strings, tootie-fruitti sound effects and flute toots to boot, not to mention Anderson&#x27;s warbling lyricism.&quot; Concluding, the reviewer said: &quot;Remember: Tull rhymes with dull.&quot;

The &quot;AllMusic&quot; review, by Bruce Eder, recognizes the quality of the album and the musicians, but stated that: &quot;[&quot;War Child&quot;] never made the impression of its predecessors, however, as it was a return to standard-length songs following two epic-length pieces. It was inevitable that the material would lack power, if only because the opportunity for development that gave &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; and &quot;A Passion Play&quot; some of their power.&quot;

==Releases==
Tracks slated to accompany the film such as &quot;Quartet&quot; and &quot;Warchild Waltz&quot; (called &quot;Waltz of the Angels&quot; on the Theatre Edition) were unearthed and released across several Tull compilations, and finally all of them appeared on the 2002 CD reissue.

In 2014, to commemorate the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary, War Child: The 40th Anniversary Theatre Edition was released; a 2 CD/2 DVD, limited edition package, remixed by Steven Wilson containing unreleased tracks, a promo video of &quot;The Third Hoorah&quot;, orchestral pieces that were originally written for the film project, a script synopsis and track-by-track annotations by Ian Anderson.

<text>The Doomsday rule, Doomsday algorithm or Doomsday method is an algorithm of determination of the day of the week for a given date. It provides a perpetual calendar because the Gregorian calendar moves in cycles of 400 years. The algorithm for mental calculation was devised by John Conway in 1973, drawing inspiration from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s perpetual calendar algorithm. It takes advantage of each year having a certain day of the week upon which certain easy-to-remember dates, called the &quot;doomsdays&quot;, fall; for example, the last day of February, April 4 (4/4), June 6 (6/6), August 8 (8/8), October 10 (10/10), and December 12 (12/12) all occur on the same day of the week in the year.

Applying the Doomsday algorithm involves three steps: determination of the anchor day for the century, calculation of the anchor day for the year from the one for the century, and selection of the closest date out of those that always fall on the doomsday, e.g., 4/4 and 6/6, and count of the number of days (modulo 7) between that date and the date in question to arrive at the day of the week. The technique applies to both the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar, although their doomsdays are usually different days of the week.

The algorithm is simple enough that it can be computed mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on.

==Anchor days for some contemporary years==
Doomsday&#x27;s anchor day for the current year in the Gregorian calendar (2025) is . For some other contemporary years:

The table is filled in horizontally, skipping one column for each leap year. This table cycles every 28 years, except in the Gregorian calendar on years that are a multiple of 100 (such as 1800, 1900, and 2100 which are not leap years) that are not also a multiple of 400 (like 2000 which is still a leap year). The full cycle is 28 years (1,461 weeks) in the Julian calendar and 400 years (20,871 weeks) in the Gregorian calendar.

==Memorable dates that always land on Doomsday==
One can find the day of the week of a given calendar date by using a nearby doomsday as a reference point. To help with this, the following is a list of easy-to-remember dates for each month that always land on the doomsday.

The last day of February is always a doomsday. For January, January 3 is a doomsday during common years and January 4 a doomsday during leap years, which can be remembered as &quot;the 3rd during 3 years in 4, and the 4th in the 4th year&quot;. For March, one can remember either Pi Day or &quot;March 0&quot;, the latter referring to the day before March 1, i.e. the last day of February.

For the months April through December, the even numbered months are covered by the double dates 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, and 12/12, all of which fall on the doomsday. The odd numbered months can be remembered with the mnemonic &quot;I work from 9 to 5 at the 7-11&quot;, i.e., 9/5, 7/11, and also 5/9 and 11/7, are all doomsdays (this is true for both the Day/Month and Month/Day conventions).

Several well-known dates, such as Independence Day in United States, Boxing Day, and Valentine&#x27;s Day in common years, also fall on doomsdays every year. The chart below includes only the mnemonics covered in the sources listed.

Since the doomsday for a particular year is directly related to weekdays of dates in the period from March through February of the next year, common years and leap years have to be distinguished for January and February of the same year.

===Example===
To find which day of the week Christmas Day of 2021 is, proceed as follows: in the year 2021, doomsday is on Sunday. Since December 12 is a doomsday, December 25, being thirteen days afterwards (two weeks less a day), fell on a Saturday. Christmas Day is always the day of the week before doomsday. In addition, July 4 (U.S. Independence Day) is always on the same day of the week as a doomsday, as are Halloween (October 31), Pi Day (March 14), and December 26 (Boxing Day).

==Mnemonic weekday names==
Since this algorithm involves treating days of the week like numbers modulo 7, John Conway suggested thinking of the days of the week as &quot;Noneday&quot; or &quot;Sansday&quot; (for Sunday), &quot;Oneday&quot;, &quot;Twosday&quot;, &quot;Treblesday&quot;, &quot;Foursday&quot;, &quot;Fiveday&quot;, and &quot;Six-a-day&quot; in order to recall the number-weekday relation without needing to count them out in one&#x27;s head.

There are some languages, such as Slavic languages, Chinese, Estonian, Greek, Portuguese, Galician and Hebrew, that base some of the names of the week days in their positional order. The Slavic, Chinese, and Estonian agree with the table above; the other languages mentioned count from Sunday as day one.

==Finding a year&#x27;s anchor day==
First take the anchor day for the century. For the purposes of the doomsday rule, a century starts with &#x27;00 and ends with &#x27;99. The following table shows the anchor day of centuries 1600–1699, 1700–1799, 1800–1899, 1900–1999, 2000–2099, 2100–2199 and 2200–2299.
For the Gregorian calendar:
:Mathematical formula
: Tuesday = anchor.
:Algorithmic
:Let 
:if then anchor = Tuesday
:if then anchor = Sunday
:if then anchor = Friday
:if then anchor = Wednesday
For the Julian calendar:
: Sunday = anchor.
Note: formula_1.

Next, find the year&#x27;s anchor day. To accomplish that according to Conway:

#Divide the year&#x27;s last two digits (call this ) by 12 and let be the floor of the quotient.
#Let be the remainder of the same quotient.
#Divide that remainder by 4 and let be the floor of the quotient.
#Let be the sum of the three numbers (). (It is again possible here to divide by seven and take the remainder. This number is equivalent, as it must be, to plus the floor of divided by four.)
#Count forward the specified number of days ( or the remainder of ) from the anchor day to get the year&#x27;s one.

:formula_2

For the twentieth-century year 1966, for example:
:formula_3

As described in bullet 4, above, this is equivalent to:

:formula_4

So doomsday in 1966 fell on Monday.

Similarly, doomsday in 2005 is on a Monday:
:formula_5

===Why it works===

The doomsday&#x27;s anchor day calculation is effectively calculating the number of days between any given date in the base year and the same date in the current year, then taking the remainder modulo 7. When both dates come after the leap day (if any), the difference is just (rounded down). But 365 equals 52 × 7 + 1, so after taking the remainder we get just

:formula_6

This gives a simpler formula if one is comfortable dividing large values of by both 4 and 7. For example, we can compute

:formula_7

which gives the same answer as in the example above.

Where 12 comes in is that the pattern of formula_8 &quot;almost&quot; repeats every 12 years. After 12 years, we get formula_9. If we replace by , we are throwing this extra day away; but adding back in formula_10 compensates for this error, giving the final formula.

For calculating the Gregorian anchor day of a century: three “common centuries” (each having 24 leap years) are followed by a “leap century” (having 25 leap years). A common century moves the doomsday forward by
:formula_11
days (equivalent to two days back). A leap century moves the doomsday forward by 6 days (equivalent to one day back).

So &quot;c&quot; centuries move the doomsday forward by
:formula_12,
but this is equivalent to
:formula_13.
Four centuries move the doomsday forward by
:formula_14;
so four centuries form a cycle that leaves the doomsday unchanged (and hence the “mod 4” in the century formula).

===The &quot;odd + 11&quot; method===

A simpler method for finding the year&#x27;s anchor day was discovered in 2010 by Chamberlain Fong and Michael K. Walters, and described in their paper submitted to the 7th International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (2011). Called the &quot;odd + 11&quot; method, it is equivalent to computing

:formula_15.

It is well suited to mental calculation, because it requires no division by 4 (or 12), and the procedure is easy to remember because of its repeated use of the &quot;odd + 11&quot; rule. Furthermore, addition by 11 is very easy to perform mentally in base-10 arithmetic.

Extending this to get the anchor day, the procedure is often described as accumulating a running total in six steps, as follows:
# Let be the year&#x27;s last two digits.
#If is odd, add 11.
#Now let .
#If is odd, add 11.
#Now let .
#Count forward days from the century&#x27;s anchor day to get the year&#x27;s anchor day.

Applying this method to the year 2005, for example, the steps as outlined would be:
# (adding 11 because is odd)
# (do nothing since is even)
#Doomsday for 2005 = 6 + Tuesday = Monday

The explicit formula for the odd+11 method is:
:formula_16.

Although this expression looks daunting and complicated, it is actually simple because of a common subexpression that only needs to be calculated once.

Anytime adding 11 is needed, subtracting 17 yields equivalent results. While subtracting 17 may seem more difficult to mentally perform than adding 11, there are cases where subtracting 17 is easier, especially when the number is a two-digit number that ends in 7 (such as 17, 27, 37, ..., 77, 87, and 97).

==Correspondence with dominical letter==
Doomsday is related to the dominical letter of the year as follows.

Look up the table below for the dominical letter (DL).

For the year 2025, the dominical letter is + = .

==Overview of all Doomsdays==

* In leap years the th doomsday is in ISO week . In common years the day after the th doomsday is in week . Thus in a common year the week number on the doomsday itself is one less if it is a Sunday, i.e. in a common year starting on Friday (such as 2010, 2021, &amp; 2027).

==Computer formula for the anchor day of a year==
For computer use, the following formulas for the anchor day of a year are convenient.

For the Gregorian calendar:

:formula_17
For example, the doomsday 2009 is Saturday under the Gregorian calendar (the currently accepted calendar), since

:formula_18

As another example, the doomsday 1946 is Thursday, since

:formula_19

For the Julian calendar:

:formula_20

The formulas apply also for the proleptic Gregorian calendar and the proleptic Julian calendar. They use the floor function and astronomical year numbering for years BC.

For comparison, see the calculation of a Julian day number.

==400-year cycle of anchor days==
Since in the Gregorian calendar there are 146,097 days, or exactly 20,871 seven-day weeks, in 400 years, the anchor day repeats every four centuries. For example, the anchor day of 1700–1799 is the same as the anchor day of 2100–2199, i.e. Sunday.

The full 400-year cycle of doomsdays is given in the adjacent table. The centuries are for the Gregorian and proleptic Gregorian calendar, unless marked with a J for Julian. The Gregorian leap years are highlighted.

Negative years use astronomical year numbering. Year 25BC is −24, shown in the column of −100J (proleptic Julian) or −100 (proleptic Gregorian), at the row 76.

A leap year with Monday as doomsday means that Sunday is one of 97 days skipped in the 400-year sequence. Thus the total number of years with Sunday as doomsday is 71 minus the number of leap years with Monday as doomsday, etc. Since Monday as doomsday is skipped across February 29, 2000, and the pattern of leap days is symmetric about that leap day, the frequencies of doomsdays per weekday (adding common and leap years) are symmetric about Monday. The frequencies of doomsdays of leap years per weekday are symmetric about the doomsday of 2000, Tuesday.

The frequency of a particular date being on a particular weekday can easily be derived from the above (for a date from January 1 – February 28, relate it to the doomsday of the previous year).

For example, February 28 is one day after doomsday of the previous year, so it is 58 times each on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, etc. February 29 is doomsday of a leap year, so it is 15 times each on Monday and Wednesday, etc.

===28-year cycle===
Regarding the frequency of doomsdays in a Julian 28-year cycle, there are 1 leap year and 3 common years for every weekday, the latter 6, 17 and 23 years after the former (so with intervals of 6, 11, 6, and 5 years; not evenly distributed because after 12 years the day is skipped in the sequence of doomsdays). The same cycle applies for any given date from March 1 falling on a particular weekday.

For any given date up to February 28 falling on a particular weekday, the 3 common years are 5, 11, and 22 years after the leap year, so with intervals of 5, 6, 11, and 6 years. Thus the cycle is the same, but with the 5-year interval after instead of before the leap year.

Thus, for any date except February 29, the intervals between common years falling on a particular weekday are 6, 11, 11. See e.g. at the bottom of the page Common year starting on Monday the years in the range 1906–2091.

For February 29 falling on a particular weekday, there is just one in every 28 years, and it is of course a leap year.

===Julian calendar===
The Gregorian calendar is currently accurately lining up with astronomical events such as solstices. In 1582 this modification of the Julian calendar was first instituted. In order to correct for calendar drift, 10 days were skipped, so doomsday moved back 10 days (i.e. 3 weekdays): Thursday, October 4 (Julian, doomsday is Wednesday) was followed by Friday, October 15 (Gregorian, doomsday is Sunday). The table includes Julian calendar years, but the algorithm is for the Gregorian and proleptic Gregorian calendar only.

Note that the Gregorian calendar was not adopted simultaneously in all countries, so for many centuries, different regions used different dates for the same day.
==Full examples==

===Example 1 (1985)===
Suppose we want to know the day of the week of September 18, 1985. We begin with the century&#x27;s anchor day, Wednesday. To this, add , , and above:

* is the floor of , which is 7.
* is , which is .
* is the floor of , which is 0.

This yields . Counting 8 days from Wednesday, we reach Thursday, which is the doomsday in 1985. (Using numbers: In modulo 7 arithmetic, 8 is congruent to 1. Because the century&#x27;s anchor day is Wednesday (index 3), and 3 + 1 = 4, doomsday in 1985 was Thursday (index 4).) We now compare September 18 to a nearby doomsday, September 5. We see that the 18th is 13 past a doomsday, i.e. one day less than two weeks. Hence, the 18th was a Wednesday (the day preceding Thursday). (Using numbers: In modulo 7 arithmetic, 13 is congruent to 6 or, more succinctly, −1. Thus, we take one away from the doomsday, Thursday, to find that September 18, 1985, was a Wednesday.)

===Example 2 (other centuries)===
Suppose that we want to find the day of week that the American Civil War broke out at Fort Sumter, which was April 12, 1861. The anchor day for the century was 94 days after Tuesday, or, in other words, Friday (calculated as ; or just look at the chart, above, which lists the century&#x27;s anchor days). The digits 61 gave a displacement of six days so doomsday was Thursday. Therefore, April 4 was Thursday so April 12, eight days later, was a Friday.

<doc id="626582" wikidata="Q5497219" url="?curid=626582" title="Frederick A. Shannon">
<text>Frederick Albert Shannon Jr. (May 4, 1921 – August 31, 1965) was an American herpetologist and physician. He was born in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, the son of historian Fred Albert Shannon and Edna M. (Jones) Shannon.

==Education==
In 1939, Shannon moved to Champaign, Illinois, and began studying zoology at the University of Illinois, where he got a B.A. in zoology in 1943. He then started studying medicine and got an M.D. in 1947. He practiced for one year at the St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, before going back to Illinois for some post-graduate herpetology work. In 1949 he moved to Wickenburg, Arizona.

==Career==
Between 1951 and 1953, Shannon was sent as a lieutenant to Korea, where although on active service in a war zone he still found opportunities to collect many reptile specimens. Back in the U.S., he published many articles on venomous snake bites, venomology, and herpetology. From 1956 on, he collected specimens mainly in Mexico.

Shannon is commemorated in the scientific names of two lizards: &quot;Sceloporus shannonorum&quot; and &quot;Urosaurus graciosus shannoni&quot;. The specific name, &quot;shannonorum&quot;, which is genitive plural, honors both Shannon and his wife.

==Death==
Shannon died from the bite of a Mojave rattlesnake he had attempted to catch.

<text>The Adam Mickiewicz University (; Latin: &quot;Universitas Studiorum Mickiewicziana Posnaniensis&quot;) is a research university in Poznań, Poland. Due to its history, the university is traditionally considered among Poland&#x27;s most reputable institutions of higher learning, this standing equally being reflected in national rankings.

It traces its origins to 1611, when under the Royal Charter granted by King Sigismund III Vasa, the Jesuit College became the first university in Poznań. The Poznań Society for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences which played an important role in leading Poznań to its reputation as a chief intellectual centre during the Age of Positivism and partitions of Poland, initiated founding of the university. The inauguration ceremony of the newly founded institution took place on 7 May 1919 that is 308 years after it was formally established by the Polish king and on 400th anniversary of the foundation of the Lubrański Academy which is considered its predecessor. Its original name was Piast University (Polish: &quot;Wszechnica Piastowska&quot;), which later in 1920 was renamed to University of Poznań (Polish: &quot;Uniwersytet Poznański&quot;). During World War II staff and students of the university opened an underground Polish University of the Western Lands (Polish: &quot;Uniwersytet Ziem Zachodnich&quot;). In 1955 University of Poznań adopted a new patron, the 19th-century Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz, and changed to its current name.

The university is organized into six principal academic units—five research schools consisting of twenty faculties and the doctoral school—with campuses throughout the historic Old Town and Morasko. The university employs roughly 4,000 academics, and has more than 40,000 students who study in some 80 disciplines. More than half of the student body are women. The language of instruction is usually Polish, although several degrees are offered in either German or English. The university library is one of Poland&#x27;s largest, and houses one of Europe&#x27;s largest Masonic collections, including the 1723 edition of James Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Constitutions of the Free-Masons&quot;.

The university is currently publishing over 79 research journals, most of them on Pressto publishing platform based on Open Journal System. Adam Mickiewicz University Repository (AMUR) contains over 23,704 records of research publications and is one of the first research repositories in Poland.

Adam Mickiewicz University is a member of the European University Association, EUCEN, SGroup European Universities&#x27; Network, Compostela Group of Universities and EPICUR.

== History ==
From the beginning, the history of the Adam Mickiewicz University has been inextricably linked to the history of Poznań itself and in some measure – the history of the entire Republic of Poland, which, partitioned by the neighboring countries (Prussia, Austria-Hungary and Russia) towards the end of the eighteenth century disappeared from the European map for more than a hundred years. On 28 October 1611, when under the Royal Charter granted by King Sigismund III Vasa, the Jesuit College became the first university in Poznań. These edicts were later affirmed with charters issued by King John II Casimir in 1650, and King John III Sobieski in 1678, the university in Poznań lasted until 1773. Based on these charters, the university granted scholar degrees to its members.

The inauguration ceremony of the newly founded took place on 7 May 1919, that is 308 years after it was formally established by the Polish king and the 400th anniversary of the foundation of the Lubrański Academy which is considered its spiritual predecessor. Its original name was Piast University (Polish: &quot;Wszechnica Piastowska&quot;), which later in 1920, was renamed to the University of Poznań (Polish: &quot;Uniwersytet Poznański&quot;). In 1920, sociologist Florian Znaniecki founded the first Polish department of sociology at the university, one of the first such departments in Europe. In the same period of the university&#x27;s history, botanist Józef Paczoski founded the world&#x27;s first institute of phytosociology.

After the invasion of Poland, Poznań was annexed by Germany and the university was closed by the Nazis in 1939. It was reopened as a German university in 1941, which operated until 1944. Staff and students of the Polish university, some of them expelled by Germans to Warsaw, opened an underground Polish University of the Western Lands (Polish: &quot;Uniwersytet Ziem Zachodnich&quot;), whose classes met in private apartments (see Education in Poland during World War II). Many of the professors and staff were imprisoned and executed in Fort VII in Poznań, including professor Stanisław Pawłowski (rector in the years 1932–33). The Polish university reopened, in much smaller form, after the end of World War II. In 1950, the Medical Faculty, including the Dentistry section and the Faculty of Pharmacy, were split off to form a separate institution, now the Poznań University of Medical Sciences. In 1955, the University of Poznań adopted a new patron, the 19th-century Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz, and changed to its current name.

== Sites ==

The university&#x27;s central administrative building is Collegium Minus, on the west side of Adam Mickiewicz Square at the western end of the street Święty Marcin. (This is one of a group of buildings, including the Imperial Palace, built in the first decade of the 20th century while Poznań was still under German rule; it originally housed a Royal Academy.) Adjoining this is the Aula, which is frequently used for ceremonies and for classical music concerts, and Collegium Iuridicum (accommodating the law faculty). Some teaching takes place in Collegium Maius, another of the aforementioned group of buildings (on ul. Fredry), although this is mainly used by the medical university. Other buildings in the city centre include former communist party headquarters on Święty Marcin, Collegium Novum (used mainly for language teaching) on Al. Niepodległości, and the university library on ul. Ratajczaka.

The university also uses a number of other buildings in southern and western districts of Poznań. However, it is strongly developing its site at Morasko in the north of the city. As of 2006, the faculties of physics, mathematics and computer science, biology, geographical and geological science had moved to the new location. In 2015 they were joined by the faculty of history (Collegium Historicum Novum).

The university also has external branches in other towns of western Poland, including Kalisz, Ostrów Wielkopolski and Słubice. Adam Mickiewicz University maintains close cooperation with Viadrina European University, Germany. The two universities jointly operate the Collegium Polonicum, located just opposite Viadrina on the Polish side of the Oder River.

University owns a seasonal polar research station located in the Petuniabukta (Petunia Bay), in the Northern part of Billefjord, and central part of Spitsbergen island in the Svalbard archipelago.

As of 2024, Adam Mickiewicz University owns and operates retreats in three historical palaces in the Wielkopolska region: the Rococo Ciążeń Palace (built in 1768), the Classicist Gułtowy Palace (built in 1786), and the Neo-Renaissance Palace in Obrzycko (built in 1862).

==Staff and student numbers==

At the start of the 2008/2009 academic year, the university had 46,817 undergraduates (including about 18,000 on weekend or evening courses), 1308 doctoral students, and 2247 other post-graduate students. The number of undergraduates declined slightly between 2005 and 2008.

At the end of 2008, the university had a total of 2892 teaching staff, including 257 full professors and 490 associate/assistant professors. It also had 2120 other employees.

== Reputation ==

The Adam Mickiewicz University is one of the top Polish universities. It was ranked by &quot;Perspektywy&quot; magazine as the third best Polish university. International rankings such as ARWU and QS University Rankings rank the university as the fourth best Polish higher level institution.

On the list of the best Emerging Europe and Central Asia universities compiled by QS University Rankings, the Adam Mickiewicz University was placed as 60th. In 2020, QS World University Ranking by Subject positioned the Adam Mickiewicz University as one of the best higher level institutions among the top 101–150 in Linguistics, 251–300 in English studies, 371 in Arts &amp; Humanities and 551–600 in Physics &amp; Astronomy, Chemistry and Biology.

=== The Enigma Codebreakers ===

In the 1920s the German military began using a 3-rotor Enigma, whose security was increased in 1930 by the addition of a plugboard. The Polish Cipher Bureau sought to break it due to the threat that Poland faced from Germany, but its early attempts did not succeed. Near the beginning of 1929, the Polish Cipher Bureau realized that mathematicians may make good codebreakers; the bureau invited math students at University of Poznań to take a class on cryptology.

After the class, the Bureau recruited some students to work part-time at a Bureau branch set up in Poznań for the students. The branch operated for some time. On 1 September 1932, 27-year-old Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski and two fellow Poznań University mathematics graduates, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki, joined the Bureau full-time and moved to Warsaw. Their first task was to reconstruct a four-letter German naval cipher.
=== Honorary doctors ===

<text>HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; was a British fast battleship built during the Second World War and commissioned after the war ended. She was the largest and fastest of the Royal Navy&#x27;s battleships, and the only ship of her class. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was the last battleship to be built in history.

The Royal Navy anticipated being outnumbered by the combined German and Japanese battleships in the early 1940s, and had therefore started building the s. However, the time-consuming construction of the triple- turrets for the &quot;Lion&quot; class would delay their completion until 1943 at the earliest. The British had enough guns and turrets in storage to allow one ship of a modified &quot;Lion&quot;-class design with four twin-15-inch turrets to be completed faster than the &quot;Lion&quot;-class vessels that had already been laid down. Work on &quot;Vanguard&quot; was started and stopped several times during the war, and her design was revised several times during her construction to reflect war experience. These stoppages and changes prevented her from being completed before the end of the war.

&quot;Vanguard&quot;″s first task after completing her sea trial at the end of 1946 was, early the next year, to convey King George VI and his family on the first Royal Tour of South Africa by a reigning monarch. While refitting after her return, she was selected for another Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1948. This was cancelled due to King George&#x27;s declining health and &quot;Vanguard&quot; briefly became flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1949. After her return home in mid-1949, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Throughout her career, the battleship usually served as the flagship of any unit to which she was assigned. During the early 1950s, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was involved in a number of training exercises with NATO forces. In 1953 she participated in Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Coronation Review. While she was refitting in 1955, the Admiralty announced that the ship was going to be put into reserve upon completion of the work. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was sold for scrap and was broken up beginning in 1960.

==Design and description==
By early 1939 it was clear that the first two s could not be delivered before 1943 at the earliest and that further battleship construction would be necessary to match the German and Japanese battleships already under construction. The main constraint on the construction of any new battleships was the limited available capacity and the time required to build large-calibre guns and their gun turrets. Using four existing twin 15-inch mountings offered the possibility of bypassing this bottleneck and allowed the construction of a single fast battleship more quickly than building more &quot;Lion&quot;-class ships. The turrets were originally built for the battlecruisers and during the First World War, and were removed during the conversions of these ships to aircraft carriers in the 1920s. To save time, the &quot;Lion&quot; design was modified to accommodate the four turrets, and preliminary design work began in July 1939. The square or transom stern was retained as it was estimated to improve speed at full power by . This made &quot;Vanguard&quot; the only British battleship built with a transom stern, as the &quot;Lion&quot;s were never finished.

Design work was suspended on 11 September 1939, after the start of the Second World War, but resumed in February 1940 after the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, expressed an interest in the ship. The design was modified to increase protection against shell splinters on the unprotected sides of the ship&#x27;s hull, the armour of the secondary armament was increased to resist semi-armour-piercing bombs, and the splinter belt&#x27;s thickness fore and aft of the main armour belt was reduced by in compensation. A small conning tower was added aft, and four Unrotated Projectile mounts were added to supplement the six octuple-barrel 2-pounder anti-aircraft mounts already planned.

More pressing commitments forced the preliminary design work to be suspended again in June; when it resumed in October the design was modified again in light of recent war experience. Greater fuel capacity was added and the armour protection improved, but these changes deepened the design&#x27;s draught to beyond the limit of the Suez Canal. The thickness of the main belt was reduced by to save weight, but the primary method chosen to reduce the draught was to increase the beam by . This exceeded the width of the docks at Rosyth and Plymouth, which severely limited the number of docks that could handle the ship, but the changes were approved by the Board of Admiralty on 17 April 1941. The ship had already been ordered on 14 March under the 1940 Emergency War Programme, although the drawings were not turned over to John Brown &amp; Company until ten days later.
&quot;Vanguard&quot;″s design was revised again, while the ship was under construction in 1942, to reflect lessons learned from the loss of the battleship and operations with the other battleships. The longitudinal distance between the inboard and outboard propellers was increased from to reduce the chance of a single torpedo wrecking both propeller shafts on one side and watertight access trunks were added to all spaces below the deep waterline to prevent the progressive flooding through open watertight doors and hatches that had happened to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. This change and the relocation of some of the ammunition handling rooms from the lower deck to the middle deck seriously delayed the ship&#x27;s completion. The design requirement that the guns of &#x27;A&#x27; turret be capable of firing straight ahead at 0° of elevation was sacrificed to allow her freeboard forward to be increased, and her bow was reshaped to make it less prone to shipping water and throwing sea spray in head seas. The ship&#x27;s fuel supply was increased from to to prevent the fuel shortage problems suffered by and during their pursuit of the . The Unrotated Projectile mounts were deleted from the design and the light anti-aircraft armament was increased to a total of 76 two-pounders in one quadruple, and nine octuple mounts and 24 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were also added in 12 twin mounts. Space for these was made available by removing the two floatplanes, the catapult and their associated facilities.

A proposal was made in 1942 to convert &quot;Vanguard&quot; to an aircraft carrier. The Director of Naval Construction stated that doing so along the lines of the would present no major difficulties but would require six months to redesign the ship. The proposal was formally rejected on 17 July.

===General characteristics===
&quot;Vanguard&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship was significantly larger than her predecessors of the class, almost longer and displacing about more than the older ships at deep load. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was overweight by some , which magnified the difference. The ship had a complete double bottom deep and she was divided into 27 main compartments by watertight bulkheads.

The &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships had been built with almost no sheer to the main deck forwards to allow &#x27;A&#x27; turret to fire straight forward at zero elevation, resulting in those ships being wet forward. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was redesigned as a result of this experience, significant sheer and flare being added to the bow. The ship&#x27;s seaworthiness was well regarded, and the ship was able to keep an in rough seas. At full load &quot;Vanguard&quot; had a metacentric height of .

As a fleet flagship, her complement was 115 officers and 1,860 men in 1947. Air conditioning was provided for many of the ship&#x27;s control spaces, and asbestos insulation was provided on exposed areas of the ship&#x27;s sides, decks and bulkheads. Steam heating was provided for her armament, instruments, look-out positions and other equipment to make &quot;Vanguard&quot; suitable for operations in the Arctic. An Action Information Centre was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around &quot;Vanguard&quot;.

===Propulsion===
To save design time, the four-shaft unit machinery from the &quot;Lion&quot;-class battleship was duplicated with alternating boiler and engine rooms. &quot;Vanguard&quot; had four sets of single-reduction geared Parsons steam turbines housed in separate engine rooms. Each set consisted of one high-pressure and one low-pressure turbine, driving a propeller in diameter. The turbines were powered by eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers in four boiler rooms at a working pressure of and temperature of . The engines were designed to produce a total of and a speed of , but achieved more than during the ship&#x27;s sea trials in July 1946, when she reached a speed of . After trials, the three-bladed propellers on the inboard shafts were replaced by five-bladed propellers to reduce vibrations of the inboard propeller shafts, but this was a failure.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; was designed to carry 4,850 long tons of fuel oil and of diesel fuel. With a clean bottom she could steam at a speed of for . The ship had four turbogenerators and four diesel generators that supplied electricity via the common ring main at 220 volts. Their total output of was the largest of any British battleship.

===Armament===
The ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of eight 42-calibre BL 15-inch Mk I guns in four twin hydraulically powered gun turrets, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. The guns were loaded at +5°; when the turrets were modernised to the Mk I(N) RP12 design, their maximum elevation was increased from 20° to +30°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , for a maximum normal range of . The guns could use supercharges, which gave a maximum range of with the same shells. Their rate of fire was two rounds per minute. &quot;Vanguard&quot; carried 100 shells per gun.
The old 15-inch turrets had been designed when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, and it was not cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement, which had been adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that the turrets&#x27; hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.

The secondary armament consisted of sixteen 50-calibre QF 5.25-inch Mk I* dual-purpose guns in eight twin gun mounts. They had a maximum depression of −5° and a maximum elevation of 70°. They fired an high-explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of . The improved RP10 spec 5.25 turrets on &quot;Vanguard&quot; were claimed to be fully automatic, with a power-rammed breech and automatic tracking and elevation under radar control enabling a rate of fire of about 18 rounds per minute. At maximum elevation, the guns had a maximum range of . 391 rounds were provided for each gun.

Short-range air defence was provided by 73 Bofors 40 mm AA guns in a variety of mountings. &quot;Vanguard&quot; had ten sextuple-barrel power-operated mounts concentrated in the superstructure and stern, a twin-barrel mount on &#x27;B&#x27; turret and 11 power-operated single mounts on the upper deck and rear superstructure. All mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to +90°. The gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The guns&#x27; rate of fire was approximately 120 rounds per minute. Space was not available to stow the standard allowance of 1,564 rounds per gun, and &quot;Vanguard&quot; carried only 1,269 rounds per gun. Two of the single guns on the quarterdeck were removed in 1949, and five others during a major refit in 1954. All of her multiple Bofors mounts were removed at this same time.

===Fire control===
&quot;Vanguard&quot; was unique among British battleships in having remote power control (RPC) for her main, secondary and tertiary guns along with the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk X for surface fire control of the main armament. There were two director control towers (DCT) for the 15-inch guns, each carrying a &quot;double cheese&quot; Type 274 fire-control radar for range finding and spotting the fall of shot. Each DCT could control all four turrets, &#x27;B&#x27; turret could control &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets, and &#x27;X&#x27; turret could control &#x27;Y&#x27; turret. There were four American Mark 37 DCTs for the 5.25-inch guns, each carrying the twin domes of Type 275 gunnery radar. Each Mark VI sextuple 40 mm Bofors mounting was provided with a separate CRBF (&quot;close range blind fire&quot;) director fitted with a Type 262 radar, although the ship never mounted her complete outfit of those directors. The STAAG Mk II 40 mm Bofors mounting carried its own Type 262 on the mounting itself. Other radar sets carried were Type 960 air and surface search, Type 293 target indication and Type 277 radar height finding.

When the 15-inch gun turrets were modernised, their rangefinders were replaced by ones in all turrets except &#x27;A&#x27;, and they were fitted for RPC in azimuth only. The turrets were also provided with de-humidifying equipment and insulation to improve their habitability.

===Protection===

The ship&#x27;s armour scheme was based on that of the &quot;King George V&quot; class with a thinner waterline belt and additional splinter protection. Originally the belt armour was equal to that of the older ships, but it had to be reduced to offset weight increases when the design was modified to reflect wartime experience. The waterline main belt was composed of Krupp cemented armour (KCA) thick but increased to abreast the magazines. It was high and tapered to a thickness of at the bottom edge of the belt. Fore and aft of the transverse bulkheads that closed off the central citadel, the belt continued almost to the ends of the ship. Forward it tapered to a thickness of and a height of , and aft to the same thickness but a height of . At the aft end of the steering gear compartment was a transverse bulkhead. After the Battle of the Denmark Strait in 1941, non-cemented armour bulkheads were added on the sides of the magazines, to protect them from splinters from any hits from plunging shells that might have penetrated the ship&#x27;s side beneath her belt.

When the gun turrets from the First World War-era battlecruisers were modernised, their KCA faceplates were replaced by new ones 13 inches thick, and their roofs were replaced by non-cemented armour plates. Their sides remained in thickness. The barbettes for the 15-inch guns were 13 inches thick on the sides but tapered to closer to the centreline of the ship. The side and roof armour of the 5.25-inch turrets was thick. Their ammunition hoists were protected by armour thick.

Intended to resist the impact of a armour-piercing bomb dropped from a height of , &quot;Vanguard&quot;″s deck protection was identical to that of the &quot;King George V&quot; class, six-inch non-cemented armour over the magazines that reduced to over the machinery spaces. The armour continued forward and aft of the citadel at the lower-deck level. Forward it tapered in steps from five inches down to 2.5 inches near the bow. Aft, it protected the steering gear and propeller shafts with 4.5 inches of armour before tapering to a thickness of 2.5 inches near the stern. Unlike the Germans, French and Americans, the British no longer believed that heavy armour for the conning tower served any real purpose given that the chance of hitting it was very small; &quot;Vanguard&quot;″s conning tower was therefore protected with of armour on the face and 2.5 inches on the sides and rear. The secondary conning tower aft had of armour on its sides.

&quot;Vanguard&quot;″s underwater protection was enhanced when she was redesigned in 1942 to reflect the lessons learned when &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers. It still consisted of a three-layer system of voids and liquid-filled compartments meant to absorb the energy of an underwater explosion. It was bounded on the inside by the torpedo bulkhead. Her enlarged oil tanks reduced the empty spaces that could flood and cause the ship to list, and greater provision was made to pump these spaces out. The longitudinal bulkheads of the side protection system were raised one deck higher to further subdivide the spaces behind the waterline armour belt. The side protection system had a maximum depth of , but this decreased significantly as the ship narrowed at its ends. Over the length of the citadel, this system was found during full-scale trials to be proof against of TNT.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Vanguard&quot; was laid down on 2 October 1941 by John Brown and Company of Clydebank, Scotland, with the yard number of 567. After the Japanese invasion of Malaya in December, the ship was given an A1 priority in the hope of finishing her by the end of 1944, and construction of the light cruiser HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, as well as some merchant shipping, was halted to expedite the ship&#x27;s completion. This was unsuccessful, however, due to a shortage of skilled labour. As a result, it was not until 30 November 1944 that the ship was launched. Princess Elizabeth presided over this ceremony, the first ship she ever launched, and was presented with a diamond rose brooch to commemorate the event. Two yard workers were killed and six others injured when a &quot;blinding explosion ripped&quot; the ship in a fitting-out basin at Clydebank on 16 September 1945. Captain William Gladstone Agnew assumed command on 15 October 1945. The end of hostilities following Japan&#x27;s surrender reduced the need for new warships, and consequently the ship was not commissioned until 12 May 1946. By this time, a total of £11,530,503, including £3,186,868 for the modernisation of the main armament, had been spent on producing &quot;Vanguard&quot;.
After commissioning, the ship spent several months conducting sea trials and training until August, when she began the necessary modifications to serve as a royal yacht for the forthcoming royal tour of South Africa. The Admiral&#x27;s suite was reworked into accommodations for the Royal Family and their staff while the anti-aircraft mount on top of &#x27;B&#x27; turret was replaced by a saluting platform. Agnew was promoted to rear-admiral with effect from 8 January 1947. The alterations were complete by December, and &quot;Vanguard&quot; made a shakedown cruise into the Central Atlantic and made a port visit to Gibraltar on the return voyage. Initially escorted by the destroyers , , , , and , the ship rendezvoused with the Home Fleet on 1 February 1947 to receive a 21-gun salute led by the battleships and , and the aircraft carrier . Later that morning, a Hoverfly helicopter landed aboard to pick up mail and photographic film.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; arrived in Cape Town on 17 February, escorted by the South African frigates , and on the last leg of her voyage. While the Royal Family toured the country on the first visit by a reigning monarch to South Africa, the ship exercised with ships of the South African and Royal Navies stationed there and made port visits to a number of South African cities. She sailed for home on 22 April and made brief visits to Saint Helena and Ascension Island en route. &quot;Vanguard&quot; arrived in Portsmouth on 11 May, and Captain F. R. Parham relieved the newly promoted Agnew on 29 May. In July, the ship began an overhaul in Devonport, which lasted until August 1948. While she was refitting, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was tasked to carry the Royal Family on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, planned for January 1949. On 31 August, she began a shakedown cruise to the Mediterranean and returned to Devonport on 12 November. Around this time, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was considered, along with a number of other large warships, for conversion to carry anti-aircraft missiles, but nothing further was done along these lines.

George VI was now too ill for travel, and the Royal Tour was indefinitely postponed later that month. &quot;Vanguard&quot; became the flagship of Admiral Sir Arthur Power, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, on 1 March 1949, and the ship made port visits to Algeria, France, Italy, Cyprus, Libya, Lebanon, Greece and Egypt before she arrived back at Devonport on 21 July. The newly promoted Rear Admiral Parham was relieved by Captain G. V. Gladstone a week later. The ship then became the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron under Rear Admiral Edward Evans-Lombe on 12 November. While returning from a brief training sortie to Gibraltar, &quot;Vanguard&quot; went to the aid of a small French merchantman whose cargo had shifted in a severe storm on 13 February 1950. The merchantman, , was taken under tow and the cargo was redistributed. Once the storm had abated, &quot;Boffa&quot; was able to resume her voyage under her own power. &quot;Vanguard&quot; reached Weymouth Bay the following day. Later, in March, she fired the salute to Vincent Auriol, the President of France, during his state visit to Great Britain.
On 13 September 1950 Admiral Sir Philip Vian hoisted his flag as Commander in Chief, Home Fleet, on &quot;Vanguard&quot; and the ship joined the rest of Home Fleet on exercises with the Royal Canadian Navy and the Mediterranean Fleet. On 19 December, Vian transferred his flag to . Nearly two months later, on 10 February 1951, the aircraft carrier collided with &quot;Vanguard&quot; as the carrier docked at Gibraltar. The hole in the battleship&#x27;s stern was not serious, and Vian re-hoisted his flag in &quot;Vanguard&quot; shortly afterwards. After manoeuvres with &quot;Indomitable&quot;, during which her aircraft &quot;sank&quot; the battleship, the ship made port visits in Genoa and Villefranche-sur-Mer before returning for a brief refit in Devonport on 14 March. After completing her refit in May, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron under Rear Admiral R. M. Dick at the Isle of Portland. Four months later the admiral transferred his flag to the carrier as &quot;Vanguard&quot; began another refit in preparation to again become the flagship of Home Fleet.
Buckingham Palace announced in November that King George VI was planning to take a short cruise for his health aboard &quot;Vanguard&quot;, which meant that her Admiral&#x27;s suite again had to be modified to accommodate him and his staff. Captain John Litchfield assumed command on 21 December while the ship was still refitting, but the King died on 6 February 1952 before he could make his cruise. A detachment from the ship participated in his funeral procession before she departed for her post-refit shakedown cruise on 22 February. After exercising with &quot;Implacable&quot;, &quot;Indomitable&quot; and the fast minelayer , &quot;Vanguard&quot; returned home on 29 March. She became flagship of Home Fleet again on 13 May when Admiral Sir George Creasy hoisted his flag. Due to manning and weight problems, &quot;Vanguard&quot; operated with many of her turrets unmanned and with ammunition carried for only two of the 15-inch turrets and only starshell ammunition for the 5.25-inch guns. She participated in exercises with the Dutch and American navies, before returning to Portsmouth for the holidays. Litchfield was relieved by Captain R. A. Ewing on 19 January 1953; the ship departed the next day for a brief refit at Gibraltar. After its completion on 2 March, the ship trained with several of the Royal Navy&#x27;s carriers before arriving back at Portsmouth on 25 March. &quot;Vanguard&quot; participated in Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 15 June 1953. The following September, she participated in NATO&#x27;s Exercise Mariner in the Denmark Strait.
Admiral Sir Michael Denny replaced Creasy as Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, on 5 January 1954 and &quot;Vanguard&quot; participated in Exercise Medflex A with Dutch and French ships in March. During the rest of the year she participated in anti-submarine and anti-aircraft exercises as well as making port visits to Oslo and Kristiansand in Norway and Helsingborg in Sweden. She was inspected on 11 July by King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden before returning home later that month. Denny struck his flag on 15 September, and &quot;Vanguard&quot; sailed to Devonport for a £220,000 refit 10 days later. The February 1955 Defence Estimates had intended her as the Home Fleet flagship with a role as a killer, but after the appointment of Earl Mountbatten in April 1955 and with Antony Eden replacing Churchill as prime minister, the government decided instead to maintain two extra cruisers in the fleet, citing the fact that strike aircraft would be the primary method of countering Soviet surface forces and that two cruisers were more flexible in their ability to be deployed in peacetime, and &quot;Vanguard&quot; was placed in reserve when it completed its 1955 refit. She subsequently became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet when Vice Admiral Richard Onslow hoisted his flag on 28 November. While moored in Fareham Creek, during her time in the reserve fleet, waterline shots of &quot;Vanguard&quot; in Portsmouth Harbour were filmed for the title sequence of the 1957 comedy film &quot;Carry on Admiral&quot;. Just before decommissioning, scenes for the 1960 film &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; were filmed aboard, with &quot;Vanguard&quot; being used to depict interiors of the bridges, Admiral&#x27;s Quarters and gun turrets for &quot;Hood&quot;, &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot;.

=== Decommissioning and fate ===
On 9 October 1959 the Admiralty announced that &quot;Vanguard&quot; would be scrapped, as she was considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain. She was decommissioned on 7 June 1960 and sold to BISCO for £560,000. On 4 August 1960, when the ship was scheduled to be towed from Portsmouth to the breaker&#x27;s yard at Faslane, Scotland, the whole of the Southsea sea front was packed with people who came to see her off. As &quot;Vanguard&quot; was being towed towards the harbour entrance, she slewed across the harbour and ran aground near the Still &amp; West pub. She was pulled off by five tugboats an hour later, and after nearly running aground again near the Moving &amp; East pub on the opposite shore, made her final exit from Portsmouth. Five days later she arrived at Faslane, and by mid-1962 the demolition process was complete. She was the last British battleship to be scrapped.

As a part of the scrapping process, sections of pre-atomic steel plate uncontaminated with radionuclides were recovered from &quot;Vanguard&quot; and used for the shielding of the whole body monitor at the Radiobiological Research Laboratory (now DSTL) at Alverstoke, Gosport, in Hampshire, England.

The process of decommissioning was filmed by the Rank Organisation for their Look at Life film series in an episode entitled &quot;The Last Battleship&quot;.

<doc id="626587" wikidata="Q732934" url="?curid=626587" title="Benefit (album)">
<text>Benefit is the third studio album by the British rock band Jethro Tull, released in April 1970. It was the first Tull album to include pianist and organist John Evan – though he was not yet considered a permanent member of the group – and the last to include bass guitarist Glenn Cornick, who was fired from the band upon completion of touring for the album. It was recorded at Morgan Studios, the same studio where the band recorded its previous album &quot;Stand Up&quot;; however, they experimented with more advanced recording techniques.

Frontman Ian Anderson said that he considers &quot;Benefit&quot; to be a much darker album than &quot;Stand Up&quot;, owing to the pressures of an extensive U.S. tour and frustration with the music business.

==Production==
Guitarist Martin Barre said that &quot;Benefit&quot; was a lot easier to make than previous albums, as the success of &quot;Stand Up&quot; allowed the musicians more artistic latitude.

Bassist Glenn Cornick stated that the band&#x27;s intention was to capture a more &quot;live&quot; feeling as &quot;I felt the last one sounded like a group of session musicians performing various songs. It was pretty cold.&quot;
&quot;Benefit&quot; incorporated studio techniques such as reverse recording (flute and piano tracks on &quot;With You There to Help Me&quot;), and manipulating the tape speed (guitar on &quot;Play in Time&quot;). In a 1970 interview Anderson noted that the addition of keyboardist John Evan had changed the band&#x27;s style: &quot;John has added a new dimension musically and I can write more freely now. In fact anything is possible with him at the keyboard&quot;.

==Musical style==
Ian Anderson said that &quot;Benefit&quot; was a &quot;guitar riff&quot; album, recorded at a time when the riff-oriented music of artists like Cream, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin was much in evidence. Anderson also noted that &quot;Benefit&quot; is &quot;a rather dark and stark album and, although it has a few songs on it that are rather okay, I don&#x27;t think it has the breadth, variety or detail that &quot;Stand Up&quot; has. But it was an evolution in terms of the band playing as &#x27;a band.&#x27;&quot; Overall, Anderson considered the album &quot;a natural part of the group&#x27;s evolution&quot;.

According to Martin Barre &quot;To Cry You a Song&quot; was a response to Blind Faith&#x27;s &quot;Had to Cry Today&quot;, &quot;although you couldn&#x27;t compare the two; nothing was stolen ... The riff crossed over the bar in a couple of places and Ian and I each played guitars on the backing tracks. It was more or less live in the studio with a couple of overdubs and a solo. Ian played my Gibson SG and I played a Les Paul on it.&quot;

==Releases==
The UK and the US release are different. The US version (with flute) of &quot;Teacher&quot; was placed on side two of the album, and the track &quot;Alive and Well and Living In&quot; was excluded. In the UK, &quot;Teacher&quot; was the B-side of the non-album single &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Promise&quot;, and was without a flute.

In 2013, the Collector&#x27;s Edition of &quot;Benefit&quot; was released. It contains bonus tracks mixed by Steven Wilson, a disc with mono and stereo mixes of rare and previously unreleased versions of tracks and singles and an audio-only DVD that includes a surround sound mix of the original album. The Collector&#x27;s Edition also includes a booklet featuring an 8,000-word essay written by Martin Webb, as well as interviews with band members and a selection of photos, some previously unseen.

For the 50th anniversary of the album, an enhanced edition was released in 2021, consisting of four CDs and two DVDs.

==Critical reception==

Critics were generally unimpressed with &quot;Benefit&quot; upon its release. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;lame and dumb&quot;. &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; was also unimpressed but recognized the band&#x27;s quality: &quot;This album doesn&#x27;t advance by such a drastic leap as &quot;Stand Up&quot; did from &quot;This Was&quot;. It&#x27;s more like the Jethro Tull we&#x27;ve seen and heard for the past year. It seems to be a remarkably long album, and shows what an exciting group this is. Exciting because they can have quite long guitar breaks and still retain a very tight and together sound&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau appreciated the riffs around which all the songs were constructed, but wasn&#x27;t impressed by the lyrics that he judged hard to recall.

===Legacy===
AllMusic and &quot;Record Collector&quot;&#x27;s much-later reviews were more positive in accepting the album&#x27;s style. Bruce Eder stated that: &quot;Most of the songs on &quot;Benefit&quot; display pleasant, delectably folk-like melodies attached to downbeat, slightly gloomy, but dazzlingly complex lyrics, with Barre&#x27;s guitar adding enough wattage to keep the hard rock listeners very interested. &#x27;To Cry You a Song&#x27;, &#x27;Son&#x27;, and &#x27;For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me&#x27; all defined Tull&#x27;s future sound: Barre&#x27;s amp cranked up to ten (especially on &#x27;Son&#x27;), coming in above Anderson&#x27;s acoustic strumming, a few unexpected changes in tempo, and Anderson spouting lyrics filled with dense, seemingly profound imagery and statements.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot; reviewer, analysing the Collector&#x27;s Edition of 2013, praised the Steven Wilson remix and wrote: &quot;&quot;Benefit&quot; forms the perfect bridge between the rolling, tumbling Tull of old and the tightly braided riffs and prickly lyrics presented by &quot;Aqualung&quot;.&quot; Paul Stump, in his &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, said that &quot;Benefit&quot; &quot;maintained the invention (and sales) of its predecessor, once again teasing unexpected emotional reflexes from time-honoured voicings and rhythms to signpost something that, if not a wholly new kind of pop song, at least offered the listener new bearings in his or her search.&quot;

<text>Miao is a word that the Chinese use to designate some ethnic minority groups living in southern China and Mainland Southeast Asia. Miao is thus officially recognized by the Chinese government as one of the largest ethnic minority groups that has more than 56 official ethnicities and dialects. The Miao live primarily in the mountains of southern China. Their homeland encompasses the provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hainan. Some sub-groups of the Miao, most notably the Hmong people, have migrated out of China into Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Northern Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand). Following the communist takeover of Laos in 1975, a large group of Hmong refugees resettled in several Western nations, mainly in the United States, France, and Australia.

Miao is a Chinese term, while the component groups of people have their own autonyms, such as (with some variant spellings) Hmong, Hmu, Xong (Qo-Xiong), and A-Hmao. These people (except those in Hainan) speak Hmongic languages, a subfamily of the Hmong–Mien languages including many mutually unintelligible languages such as the Hmong, Hmub, Xong and A-Hmao. 

Not all speakers of the Hmongic languages belong to the Miao. For example, the speakers of the Bunu and Bahengic languages are designated as the Yao, and the speakers of the Sheic languages are designated as the She and the Yao.

The Kem Di Mun people in Hainan, despite being officially designated as Miao people, are linguistically and culturally identical to the Kim Mun people in continental China who are classified as a subgroup of the Yao.

==Nomenclature: Miao or Hmong==

The term &quot;Miao&quot; gained official status in 1949 as a &quot;minzu&quot; (ethnic group) encompassing a group of linguistically related ethnic minorities in Southwest China. This was part of a larger effort to identify and classify minority groups to clarify their role in the national government, including establishing autonomous administrative divisions and allocating the seats for representatives in provincial and national government.

Historically, the term &quot;Miao&quot; was applied inconsistently to a variety of non-Han peoples. Early Chinese-based names use various transcriptions: Miao, Miao-tse, Miao-tsze, Meau, Meo, mo, Miao-tseu etc. In Southeast Asian contexts, words derived from the Chinese &quot;Miao&quot; took on a sense which was perceived as derogatory by the subgroups living in that region. The term re-appeared in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), by which time it had taken on the connotation of &quot;barbarian&quot;. Being a variation of Nanman, it was used to refer to the indigenous people in southern China who had not been assimilated into Han culture. During this time, references to &quot;raw&quot; (生 Sheng) and &quot;cooked&quot; (熟 Shu) Miao appear, referring to the level of assimilation and political cooperation of the two groups, making them easier to classify. Not until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) do more finely grained distinctions appear in writing. Even then, discerning which ethnic groups are included in various classifications can be complex. There has been a historical tendency by the Hmong, who resisted assimilation and political cooperation, to group all Miao peoples together under the term Hmong because of the potential derogatory use of the term Miao. In modern China, however, the term continues to be used regarding the Miao people there.

Though the Miao themselves use various self-designations, the Chinese traditionally classify them according to the most characteristic color of the women&#x27;s clothes. The list below contains some of these self-designations, the color designations, and the main regions inhabited by the four major groups of Miao in China:

* Ghao Xong/Qo Xiong; Xong; Red Miao; Qo Xiong Miao: West Hunan
* Gha Ne/Ka Nao; Hmub; Black Miao; Mhub Miao: Southeast Guizhou
* A-Hmao; Big Flowery Miao: West Guizhou and Northeast Yunnan
* Gha-Mu; Hmong, Mong; White Miao, Green/Blue Miao, Small Flowery Miao; South and East Yunnan, South Sichuan and West Guizhou

== Gender roles ==

=== Women&#x27;s status ===
Compared to the Confucian principles traditionally exercised over women in some regions of China, the Miao culture is generally less strict in categorization of women&#x27;s roles in society. Miao women exercise relatively more independence, mobility and social freedom. They are known to be strong willed and politically minded. They actively contribute to their communities in social welfare, education, arts and culture, and agricultural farming.

Miao women demonstrate great skill and artistry when making traditional clothing and handicrafts. They excel at embroidering, weaving, paper-cutting, batik, and intricate jewelry casting. From vests, coats, hats, collars and cuffs, to full skirts, and baby carriers, the patterns on their clothes are extremely complicated and colorful with clean lines. Girls of around seven will learn embroidering from mothers and sisters, and by the time they are teenagers, they are quite deft. Additionally, Miao silver jewelry is distinctive for its design, style and craftsmanship. Miao silver jewelry is completely handmade, carved with fine decorative patterns. It&#x27;s not easy to make and there is not one final masterpiece exactly the same as another. The Miao embroidery and silver jewelry are highly valued, delicate and beautiful.

Silver jewelry is a highly valuable craftwork of the Miao people. Apart from being a cultural tradition, it also symbolises the wealth of Miao women. As a Miao saying goes, &quot;decorated with no silver or embroidery, a girl is not a girl&quot;, Miao women are occasionally defined by the amount of silver jewelry she wears or owns. It is especially important to wear heavy and intricate silver headdresses and jewelry during significant occasions and festivals, notably during weddings, funerals and springtime celebration. Silver jewelry is an essential element of Miao marriages, particularly to the bride. Miao families would begin saving silver jewellery for the girls at an early age, wishing their daughters could marry well with the large amount of silver jewelry representing the wealth of the family. Although a growing Miao population is moving from rural Miao regions to cities, the new generation respects the families&#x27; silver heritage and is willing to pass on the practice as a cultural tradition more than a showcase of family wealth.

=== Workforce and income ===
Although Miao women are not strictly-governed, their social status is often seen as lower than that of men, as in most patriarchal societies. Be it in the subsistence economy or otherwise, men are the main economic force and provide the stable source of income for the family. Women are primarily involved in social welfare, domestic responsibilities, and additionally earn supplementary income.

As tourism became a major economic activity to this ethnic group, Miao women gained more opportunities to join the labor force and earn an income. Women mostly take up jobs that require modern day customer service skills; for example, working as tour guides, selling craftwork and souvenirs, teaching tourists how to make flower wreaths, and even renting ethnic costumes. These jobs require soft skills and hospitality and more visibility in public, but provide a low income. On the contrary, Miao men take up jobs that require more physical strengths and less visibility in public, such as engineering roads, building hotels, boats and pavilions. These jobs generally provide a more stable and profitable source of income.

The above example of unequal division of labor demonstrates, in spite of socioeconomic changes in China, men are still considered the financial backbone of the family.

=== Marriage and family ===
While the Miao people have had their own unique culture, the Confucian ideology exerted significant influences on this ethnic group. It is expected that men are the dominant figures and breadwinners of the family, while women occupy more domestic roles (like cooking and cleaning). There are strict social standards on women to be &quot;virtuous wives and good mothers&quot;, and to abide by &quot;three obediences and four virtues&quot;, which include cultural moral specifications of women&#x27;s behavior.

A Miao woman has some cultural freedom in marrying a man of her choice. However, like many other cultures in Asia, there are strict cultural practices on marriage, one being clan exogamy. It is a taboo to marry someone within the same family clan name, even when the couple are not blood related or from the same community.

In contrast to the common practice of the right of succession belonging to the firstborn son, the Miao&#x27;s inheritance descends to the youngest son. The older sons leave the family and build their own residences, usually in the same province and close to the family. The youngest son is responsible for living with and caring for the aging parents, even after marriage. He receives a larger share of the family&#x27;s inheritance and his mother&#x27;s silver jewelry collection, which is used as bridal wealth or dowry.

Some imperially commissioned Han Chinese chieftaincies assimilated with the Miao. Those became the ancestors of a part of the Miao population in Guizhou.

The Hmong Tian clan in Sizhou began in the seventh century as a migrant Han Chinese clan.

The origin of the Tunbao people traces back to the Ming dynasty when the Hongwu Emperor sent 300,000 Han Chinese male soldiers in 1381 to conquer Yunnan, with some of the men marrying Yao and Miao women.

The presence of women presiding over weddings was a feature noted in &quot;Southeast Asian&quot; marriages, such as in 1667 when a Miao woman in Yunnan married a Chinese official. Some Sinicization occurred, in Yunnan a Miao chief&#x27;s daughter married a scholar in the 1600s who wrote that she could read, write, and listen in Chinese and read Chinese classics.

== History ==

===Legend of Chiyou and origins===

According to a Tang dynasty Chinese legend, the Miao who descended from the Jiuli tribe led by Chiyou () were defeated at the Battle of Zhuolu (, a defunct prefecture on the border of present provinces of Hebei and Liaoning) by the military coalition of Huang Di () and Yan Di, leaders of the Huaxia () tribe as the two tribes struggled for supremacy of the Yellow River valley.

The San Miao, according to legend, are the descendants of the Jiuli Tribe. Chinese records record a San Miao (, Three Miao) kingdom around Dongting Lake. It was defeated by Yu the Great. Another Miao kingdom may have emerged in Yunnan around 704 BC that was subjugated by the Chinese in the 3rd century BC. In 2002, the Chu language has been identified as perhaps having influence from Tai–Kam and Miao–Yao languages by researchers at University of Massachusetts Amherst.

===Dispersal===
The Miao were not mentioned again in Chinese records until the Tang dynasty (618–907). In the following period, the Miao migrated throughout southern China and Southeast Asia. They generally inhabited mountainous or marginal lands and took up swidden or slash-and-burn cultivation techniques to farm these lands.

During the Miao Rebellions of the Ming dynasty, thousands of Miao were killed by the imperial forces. Mass castrations of Miao boys also took place.
During the Qing Dynasty the Miao fought three wars against the empire. The issue was so serious that the Yongzheng emperor sent one of his most important officials, Ortai, to be the Viceroy of the provinces with significant Miao populations in 1726, and through 1731, he spent his time putting down rebellions. In 1735 in the southeastern province of Guizhou, the Miao rose up against the government&#x27;s forced assimilation. Eight counties involving 1,224 villages fought until 1738 when the revolt ended. According to Xiangtan University Professor Wu half the Miao populations were affected by the war.

The second war (1795–1806) involved the provinces of Guizhou and Hunan. Shi Sanbao and Shi Liudeng led this second revolt. Again, it ended in failure, but it took 11 years to quell the uprising.

The greatest of the three wars occurred from 1854 to 1873. Zhang Xiu-mei led this revolt in Guizhou until his capture and death in Changsha, Hunan. This revolt affected over one million people and all the neighbouring provinces. By the time the war ended Professor Wu said only 30 percent of the Miao were left in their home regions. This defeat led to the Hmong people migrating out of China into Laos and Vietnam.

During Qing times, more military garrisons were established in southwest China. Han Chinese soldiers moved into the Taijiang region of Guizhou, married Miao women, and the children were brought up as Miao. In spite of rebellion against the Han, Hmong leaders made allies with Han merchants.

The imperial government had to rely on political means to bring in Hmong people into the government: they created multiple competing positions of substantial prestige for Miao people to participate and assimilate into the Qing government system. During the Ming and Qing times, the official position of &quot;Kiatong&quot; was created in Indochina. The Miao would employ the use of the &quot;Kiatong&quot; government structure until the 1900s when they entered into French colonial politics in Indochina.

===20th century===

During the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), the Miao played an important role in its birth when they helped Mao Zedong to escape the Kuomintang in the Long March with supplies and guides through their territory.

In Vietnam, a powerful Hmong named Vuong Chinh Duc, dubbed the king of the Hmong, aided Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s nationalist move against the French, and thus secured the Hmong&#x27;s position in Vietnam. In Điện Biên Phủ, Hmongs fought on the side of the communist Viet Minh against the pro-French Tai Dam aristocrats. During the Vietnam War, Miao fought on both sides, the Hmong in Laos primarily for the US, across the border in Vietnam for the North-Vietnam coalition, the Chinese-Miao for the Communists. However, after the war the Vietnamese were very aggressive towards the Hmong who suffered many years of reprisals. Most Hmong in Thailand also supported a brief Communist uprising during the war.

===Miao clans with Han origins===

Some of the origins of the Hmong and Miao clan names are a result of the marriage of Hmong women to Han Chinese men, with distinct Han Chinese-descended clans and lineages practicing Han Chinese burial customs. These clans were called &quot;Han Chinese Hmong&quot; (&quot;Hmong Sua&quot;) in Sichuan, and were instructed in military tactics by fugitive Han Chinese rebels. Such Chinese &quot;surname groups&quot; are comparable to the patrilineal Hmong clans and also practice exogamy.

Han Chinese male soldiers who fought against the Miao rebellions during the Qing and Ming dynasties were known to have married with non-Han women such as the Miao because Han women were less desirable. The Wang clan, founded among the Hmong in Gongxian county of Sichuan&#x27;s Yibin district, is one such clan and can trace its origins to several such marriages around the time of the Ming dynasty suppression of the Ah rebels. Nicholas Tapp wrote that, according to &quot;The Story of the Ha Kings&quot; in the village, one such Han ancestor was Wang Wu. It is also noted that the Wang typically sided with the Chinese, being what Tapp calls &quot;cooked&quot; as opposed to the &quot;raw&quot; peoples who rebelled against the Chinese.

Hmong women who married Han Chinese men founded a new Xem clan among Northern Thailand&#x27;s Hmong. Fifty years later in Chiangmai two of their Hmong boy descendants were Catholics. A Hmong woman and Han Chinese man married and founded northern Thailand&#x27;s Lau2, or Lauj, clan, with another Han Chinese man of the family name Deng founding another Hmong clan. Some scholars believe this lends further credence to the idea that some or all of the present day Hmong clans were formed in this way.

Jiangxi Han Chinese are claimed by some as the forefathers of the southeast Guizhou Miao, and Miao children were born to the many Miao women married Han Chinese soldiers in Taijiang in Guizhou before the second half of the 19th century.

==Archaeology==
According to André-Georges Haudricourt and David Strecker&#x27;s claims based on limited secondary data, the Miao were among the first people to settle in present-day China. They claim that the Han borrowed a lot of words from the Miao in regard to rice farming. This indicated that the Miao were among the first rice farmers in China. In addition, some have connected the Miao to the Daxi Culture (5,300 – 6,000 years ago) in the middle Yangtze River region. The Daxi Culture has been credited with being amongst the first cultivators of rice in the Far East by Western scholars. However, in 2006 rice cultivation was found to have existed in the Shandong province even earlier than the Daxi Culture. Though the Yuezhuang culture has cultivated rice, it is more of collected wild rice and not actual cultivated and domesticated rice like that of the Daxi.

A western study mention that the Miao (especially the Miao-Hunan) has its origins in southern China but have some DNA from the Northeast people of China. Recent DNA samples of Miao males contradict this theory. The White Hmong have 25% C, 8% D, &amp; 6% N(Tat) yet they have the least contact with the Han population.

==Demographics==
According to the 2000 census, the number of Miao in China was estimated to be about 9.6 million. Outside of China, members of the Miao sub-group or nations of the Hmong live in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Burma due to outward migrations starting in the 18th century. As a result of recent migrations in the aftermath of the Indochina and Vietnam Wars from 1949 to 1975, many Hmong people now live in the United States, French Guiana, France and Australia. Altogether, there are approximately 10 million speakers in the Miao language family. This language family, which consists of 6 languages and around 35 dialects (some of which are mutually intelligible) belongs to the Hmong/Miao branch of the Hmong–Mien (Miao–Yao) language family.

A large population of the Hmong have emigrated to the northern mountainous reaches of Southeast Asia including Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Burma. However, many continue to live in far Southwest China mostly in the provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi and to a very limited extent in Guizhou.

:&quot;Note: The Miao areas of Sichuan province became part of the newly created Chongqing Municipality in 1997.&quot;
Most Miao currently live in China. Miao population growth in China:
* 1953: 2,510,000
* 1964: 2,780,000
* 1982: 5,030,000
* 1990: 7,390,000

3,600,000 Miao, about half of the entire Chinese Miao population, were in Guizhou in 1990. The Guizhou Miao and those in the following six provinces make up over 98% of all Chinese Miao:
* Hunan: 1,550,000
* Yunnan: 890,000
* Sichuan: 530,000
* Guangxi: 420,000
* Hubei: 200,000
* Hainan: 50,000 (known as Miao but ethnically Yao and Li)

In the above provinces, there are 6 Miao autonomous prefectures (shared officially with one other ethnic minority):
* Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou
* Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou
* Qianxinan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou
* Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan
* Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan
* Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hubei

There are in addition 23 Miao autonomous counties:
* Hunan: Mayang, Jingzhou, Chengbu
* Guizhou: Songtao, Yinjiang, Wuchuan, Daozhen, Zhenning, Ziyun, Guanling, Weining
* Yunnan: Pingbian, Jinping, Luquan
* Chongqing: Xiushan, Youyang, Qianjiang, Pengshui
* Guangxi: Rongshui, Longsheng, Longlin (including Hmong)
* Hainan: Qiongzhong and Baoting

Most Miao reside in hills or on mountains, such as
* Wuling Mountain by the Qianxiang River ()
* Miao Mountain (), Qiandongnan
* Yueliang Mountain (), Qiandongnan
* Greater and Lesser Ma Mountain (), Qiannan
* Greater Miao Mountain (), Guangxi
* Wumeng Mountain by the Tianqian River ()

Several thousands of Miao left their homeland to move to larger cities like Guangzhou and Beijing. There are 789,000 Hmong spread throughout northern Vietnam, Laos, Burma, and on other continents. 174,000 live in Thailand, where they are one of the six main hill tribes.

== Distribution ==

Miao fish (苗鱼 miáo yǘ) is a dish made by steaming fish with a mixture of fresh herbs, green peppers, ginger slices and garlic.

== Genetics ==
Huang et al. (2022) found that the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup among many Hmongic-speaking ethnic groups (including Miao and Pa-Hng from Hunan, and Thailand Hmong) is O2a2a2a1a2a1a2-N5 (a subclade of O2a2a-M188), with a frequency of 47.1% among the Guangxi Miao.

<text>Parel (ISO: Paraḷ, pronunciation: ) is a neighbourhood of Mumbai. Parel used to have a number of textile mills, but these have been replaced by commercial office space development.

==History==
Originally, Parel was a separate island, one of the Seven Islands of Bombay. 

The Parel Relief or (Parel Shiva) is an important monolithic relief of the Hindu god Shiva in seven forms that is dated back to the late Gupta period, in the 5th or 6th century AD by the ASI. It was found in Parel when a road was being constructed in 1931, and moved to the nearby Baradevi Temple, where it remains in worship, in its own room. The name Parel has its roots from the &quot;Parali Vaijanath Mahadev&quot; temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. 

An inscription dated 26 January 1187 (Paurnima of Magha, Saka 1108) is found there recording of a grant made by Shilahara king Aparaditya II out of the proceeds of an orchard in a village named Mahavali (close to Kurla) for a Vaidyanatha temple.

In 1771 William Hornby, the Governor of Bombay, moved into the former friary, which became known as Government House, and a number of mills were subsequently established nearby. In 1883, the Governor&#x27;s wife died of cholera in the house and two years later, the Governor&#x27;s Mansion was moved to Malabar Point. During the plague epidemics of the 1890s, the old Government House was leased to the newly founded Haffkine Institute.

It was a district in Girangaon, which was the focus of the Great Bombay textile strike of 1982.

==Politics==
It was a Vidhan Sabha constituency of Maharashtra from 1962 to 2004. It was constituted into Shivadi constituency by the Delimitation of Parliament and Assembly Constituencies Order of 2008.

<text>Sewri (IAST: &quot;Śivdī,&quot; ) is a locality along the eastern edge of South Mumbai, in Maharashtra, India. It is also the name of a railway station on the Central Railway Harbour Line.
Sewri (pronounced as Shivdi / शिवडी) is a small hamlet on the eastern shore of the Parel island, one of the original seven islands of Bombay. Sewri has a fort that dates back to 1770. The Agri-Horticultural Society had established gardens at Sewri, which were acquired in 1865 by Arthur Crawford, then the Municipal Commissioner of Bombay, for building a European cemetery. Large parts of Sewri belong to the Bombay Port Trust and were incorporated into the harbour facilities. In 1996, the mangrove swamps of Sewri were declared a protected ecology. Lesser flamingos from other parts of India come to these mangroves to breed. The coastal area of locality includes the Sewri mudflats, a wetland. The flamingos arrive at the mudflats from the months of October to March every year. These mudflats are near the Sewri jetty, which is a 20-minute walk from the railway station.

The Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road (RAK marg) which consist of four adjacent roads begins at Sewri and ends at Maheshwari Udyan (Matunga) near King&#x27;s Circle station. Fatima High School can be found at the beginning of the RAK road. The Sewri Christian Cemetery, the largest of its kind within city limits, is located here.

Sewri East houses a number of industrial units especially those of Petrochemical industries. Sewri West is largely residential, consisting of housing societies like Sewri Koliwada, BDD Chawls and Mulraj Bhuvan. The Mulraj Bhuvan Group (MBG) is a very famous club in this area known for its sporting and social activities. Built by the British in the year 1925, Dnyaneshwar Nagar, Shivaji Nagar, Gulmohar Society, Labour Camp and Bhatwadi are located here as well. The market area is called &quot;Sewri Naka&quot;.

The opening up of mill lands and the Mumbai Port Trust lands for development has resulted in a lot of construction activity in this area. The Sewri-Nhava Sheva transharbour link, which is being planned by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), threatens the habitat of the migratory flamingos.

== Festivals ==
Ganeshutsav is the Biggest Festival is celebrated here. Pandals like, Shivaji Nagar Sarvajanik Ganeshutsav Mandal, Shivdi cha Raja, Shivdi cha Vighnaharta and T.J Road cha Raja are some famous and old pandals of Sewri.

== Notable for ==
* &quot;Lalbaug Parel&quot; (Shoot location: Shivaji Nagar)
* &quot;&quot; (Song shoot location: Shivaji Nagar)
* Our Lady of Fatima Church, Sewri

==Sewri Flamingo Point==

Sewri Flamingo Point is located at a distance of around 1 kilometre from Sewri railway station. The point has large areas of mudflats which are a safe habitat for flamingos in winter. The mudflats abound in algae, which attracts flamingos who migrate to India every year between the months of October and March to escape the cold winters.

<text>Songs from the Wood is the tenth studio album by British progressive rock band Jethro Tull, released on 11 February 1977 by Chrysalis Records. The album is considered to be the first of three folk rock albums released by the band at the end of the 1970s, followed by &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; (1978) and &quot;Stormwatch&quot; (1979).

Drawing inspiration from English folklore and countryside living, the album signalled a resumption of the band&#x27;s wide-ranging folk rock style which combined traditional instruments and melodies with hard rock drums, synthesisers and electric guitars, all laid in the band&#x27;s complex progressive rock template. The album was the first Jethro Tull album to include Dee Palmer as an official member of the band; after eight years of serving as the band&#x27;s orchestral arranger, Palmer had joined as a second keyboardist in early 1976.

&quot;Songs From the Wood&quot; was well received by critics who considered it a return to form. The album reached number 13 in the UK and number 8 in the United States. A single from the album, &quot;The Whistler&quot;, was also the band&#x27;s last US Hot 100 chart entry, peaking at number 59. Another song, &quot;Ring Out, Solstice Bells&quot;, was released ahead of the album on an EP of the same title for the 1976 Christmas season, peaking at number 28 in the UK.

==Recording==
The band began recording on 14 September 1976, recording &quot;Ring Out, Solstice Bells&quot; and finished on 16 November 1976, finishing &quot;Jack-in-the-Green&quot;. All tracks were recorded in Studio 2 of Morgan Studios (except &quot;Jack-in-the-Green&quot;, recorded in Studio 3 with Anderson on all instruments), the same studio where the band had recorded the majority of their discography up to that point. The album marked a return for the band to recording in the UK after having recorded their previous two albums abroad in Monaco.

Compared to previous Jethro Tull albums, &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot; saw greater writing contributions from other members of the band besides Anderson, particularly from new keyboardist Dee Palmer and guitarist Martin Barre. Palmer wrote significant portions of several songs, including the title track, &quot;Hunting Girl&quot;, &quot;Velvet Green&quot;, &quot;Ring Out, Solstice Bells&quot; and &quot;Pibroch (Cap in Hand)&quot; and also introduced the portative pipe organ to the rest of the band, an instrument which became a major element of the album&#x27;s classical folk sound. 

The band made use of a variety of other instruments and recording techniques to contribute to the album&#x27;s folk theme, including medieval-era percussion played by Barlow such as nakers and a tabor as well as a reverse echo guitar effect played by Barre on &quot;Pibroch (Cap in Hand)&quot; to imitate the sound of bagpipes. &quot;Ring Out, Solstice Bells&quot; was recorded with the intention of being a Christmas single. However Chrysalis Records disliked that the song was in 7/4 time and asked the band to re-record the song in the more common 4/4 time, a suggestion which Anderson said that the band &quot;weren&#x27;t particularly pleased with.&quot; The band re-recorded the song, now re-titled &quot;Magic Bells&quot; at Lansdowne Studios with Mike Batt of the Wombles producing, however the decision was eventually made by Chrysalis to scrap the new version and release the original instead. 

One song recorded during the sessions for the album was cut, initially titled &quot;Dark Ages&quot; (the same name of a different song later featured on the band&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Stormwatch&quot;), the track remained unreleased until 2017 when it was included on the 40th Anniversary &quot;Country Set&quot; edition of the album, where it was given the title &quot;Old Aces Die Hard&quot; by Anderson.

The band have identified the writing and recording sessions for the album as being a high point in personal relations within the band. Anderson credited the familiar surroundings of Morgan Studios with creating &quot;a more relaxed and harmonious atmosphere in the band&quot; with drummer Barrie Barlow agreeing that &quot;I think we were indeed more settled and happier to be home.&quot; Palmer recalled that &quot;On every measure the whole of that album was recorded in an atmosphere of great camaraderie and joy... Everybody was friends, everybody was happy.&quot; The band held a wrap party upon completion of the album&#x27;s mixing, described by Anderson as &quot;one of the very few occasions when we did have a slightly triumphal celebration of the finished thing.&quot;

==Musical style and themes==
Filled with imagery from medieval Britain (especially in the &quot;Jack-in-the-Green&quot;, &quot;Cup of Wonder&quot;, and &quot;Ring Out Solstice Bells&quot; lyrics), and ornamental folk arrangement (as in &quot;Velvet Green&quot; and &quot;Fire at Midnight&quot;), &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot; was a departure from the hard rock of earlier Jethro Tull material, though it still retained some of the band&#x27;s older, progressive sound.

Anderson&#x27;s inspiration to pursue folk was inspired by recent changes in his personal life; he had recently got married and purchased a farm estate in rural Buckinghamshire, giving him &quot;an opportunity to evaluate and reflect upon the cultural and historical significance of making that commitment to English residency.&quot; Anderson was also partly inspired by the book &quot;Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain&quot; which was given to him by Jethro Tull&#x27;s then manager Jo Lustig in 1976. According to Anderson, the book &quot;certainly gave me thoughts about the elements of characters and stories that played out in my songwriting on the &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot; album, which then carried on over to the &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; album and even beyond that into the &quot;Stormwatch&quot; album.&quot;

==Critical reception==

In a retrospective review, AllMusic called &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; &quot;the prettiest record Jethro Tull released at least since &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;&quot;. Paul Stump lauded the album in his &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, saying that &quot;the barbed, rickety grandeur that Tull had left behind with &quot;Benefit&quot; had been rebottled in punchy numbers with enough melodic contours to satisfy latter-day FM-radio demands. Once again, the band&#x27;s riffs are unremarkable, but counterpointed – such as with synthesisers playing off mandolin on the title track – and the impact is mesmerizing.&quot; He also praised the depth of the soundstage, the emphasis of the folk element in the lyrics, and the way riffs are shared around the instrumental ensemble.

In 2014, &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; was included in the list &quot;The 100 Greatest Prog Albums of All Time&quot; by &quot;Prog&quot; magazine at number 76. In 2000, it was voted number 520 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Ring Out, Solstice Bells&quot; has become popular as a Christmas song in the United Kingdom. It has been featured in lists of classic and favourite Christmas songs; a re-recorded version appears on &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot;.

Members of the band have ranked the album highly in retrospect, with Anderson counting it as among his top five personal favourite Jethro Tull albums.

== Cover ==

Although the front cover carries no credit to the effect, the back cover features the &quot; credit &quot; &quot;front cover painting by Jay L. Lee&quot;. In fact, it is a photo on which outlines, lines and contours have simply been drawn with a pen (see tree branches, the dog&#x27;s snout and Anderson&#x27;s boots), with paint only occasionally added over the photo (as in the fire). The fact that this is a photo and not a painting is backed up by several other similar photos from the same photo session, some of which were used in the programme for the British tour in 1977, as well as on the concert poster. 

The credit &quot;painting by ...&quot; is probably based on a typical trick by Ian Anderson, who likes to joke with his fans. &quot;Painting by&quot; could also only refer to the post-processing of the photo. The LP cover depicts Ian Anderson sitting on a campfire after a successful hunt with a dog and prey. The full wording on the front cover is &quot;Jethro Tull // with kitchen prose, gutter rhymes and divers // songs from the wood&quot;.

==Track listing==
===1977 original release===


==2017 40th Anniversary &quot;The Country Set&quot; Deluxe Edition==
On 17 May 2017, Jethro Tull released a five disc &quot;bookset&quot; version of &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; with a 96-page booklet that includes a track-by-track annotation of the album and its associated recordings by Ian Anderson. It is similar to the band&#x27;s other 40th Anniversary reissues, with the first disc containing another Steven Wilson stereo remix and the previously unreleased songs &quot;Old Aces Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Working John, Working Joe.&quot; The second and third discs contain 22 previously unreleased live tracks, recorded on the American leg of the 1977 Songs from the Wood Tour, from 21 November (Landover, Maryland) and 6 December (Boston), remixed to stereo by Jakko Jakszyk. The set also includes DVDs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEWS Jethro Tull / Songs From The Wood / 40th anniversary deluxe edition&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second DVD includes a complete concert movie made from video originally recorded for projecting on onstage screens at the Landover show. Because the first audio multitrack reel from the Landover show wasn&#x27;t available, Jakszyk went to great lengths to sync the footage with audio from Maryland for the first four songs. The bonus track &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth&quot; is from the Landover show as well, but excluded from the film because it was never professionally recorded and the audio is of inferior quality.

<text>is a 2003 Japanese television drama starring Takuya Kimura. The story revolves around an up-and-coming pilot, Hajime Shinkai, and portrays his interactions with others as he progresses along the road to becoming a captain. As is common in many Japanese drama series, it blends drama and romance with comedic elements. This drama also emphasizes hardship of being a pilot or a cabin crew, and the serious nature of the industry they&#x27;re in, which puts thousands of lives in its hands.

==Cast==
*Takuya Kimura as 
*Shinichi Tsutsumi as 
*Kō Shibasaki as 
*Rina Uchiyama as 
*Naoto Takenaka as 
*Yasunori Danta as 
*Hitomi Kuroki as 
*Jun Kaname as 
*Yoon Son-ha as 

==Key characters==
* Hajime Shinkai (Takuya Kimura) is the protagonist – a young, inexperienced pilot who earns notoriety among colleagues for disregarding standards and standing up to superiors. Emotional and easily provokable, he has a strong sense of justice and equally strong love of flying.
* Kazuki Kouda (Shinichi Tsutsumi) – a senior captain and chief of flight operations. Known for his very cold, nearly robotic demeanour, he has not tolerance for anything but perfect professional performance to the border of inhumanity. He is feared and disliked by most of the other characters for being very unpleasant and demanding.
* Ayumi Ogawa (Kō Shibasaki) – a stubborn, straight-talking mechanic who is as committed to her job as she is abrasive towards Shinkai. Having lost her parents in a plane crash, she decided to become a plane mechanic to make planes as safe as possible. However, she has profound fear of flying and has not had flown at the start of the series.
* Noriko Togashi (Kuroki Hitomi) – a chief cabin attendant, is committed to highest professional standards, but at the same time cares for her junior colleagues and compassionately coaches them.
* Ota Kenzaburo (Yasunori Danta) – a senior chief cabin attendant, who can be both serious about his job and the performance of his staff and cheerful and humorous when interacting with pilots. He is a big fan of Shinkai and encourages him in his development, while at the same time displaying much dislike for Kouda behind his back.
* Fukaura Urara (Rina Uchiyama) – a very junior flight attendant who only chose the job for its apparent glamour and ostensibly does not want to pursue this career path, but use the opportunity to find a husband quickly. She does not treat her job seriously and oftentimes behaves unprofessionally, which earns her scolding from other crew members. She is brash and cheeky when pursuing her goals, which include (the unwilling) Shinkai&#x27;s affections.
* Jane Naito (Naoto Takenaka) – a captain, he has a colourful character with a sense of humour and relaxed behaviour. A womanizer popular with cabin attendants, he has been married (and divorced) at least twice and makes frequent advances towards female colleagues.
* Ryujiro Azumi (Shinichiro Azumi) - a co-pilot.
* Shimamura Takashi (Hironari Amano), a young mechanic working together with Ayumi Ogawa, protective of her.
* Ryoji Shinkai (Ikariya Chosuke) – Hajime&#x27;s father, once a captain of large ships, now owns a small fishing boat business in the middle of the port of Tokyo. Wished Hajime to take over the family business and has a strained relationship with him because of him choosing to become a pilot instead.
* Makoto Shinkai (Akiyoshi Nakao) – Hajime&#x27;s younger brother, a high school student, with whom Hajime frequently fights.
* Kaori Ogawa (Miwako Ichikawa) – Ayumi&#x27;s good-natured sister, with whom she shares an apartment.
* Park Mi-suk (Yoon Son-ha) – a Korean neighbour of Shinkai, who perplexes and embarrasses him with displays of affection, implying a relationship between them (which does not exist). Serves as a comedic relief between the more serious scenes.

==Summary==
The series presents the characters interacting at work and outside of it. The focus are the flight operations, with the crew characters finding themselves inflight together having to deal with some difficult or unusual occurrences, such as unruly guests, equipment malfunctions, medical emergencies and diversions. The characters have to prove themselves handling those situations, and their relationships are both put to the test and develop.

On the ground, the characters meet at All Nippon Airways main base at Narita Airport, as well as restaurants and bars and the characters and their families&#x27; homes. The series features many scenes in the outdoors, including portraying characters driving or riding a boat. Some scenes are shot actually on location at Narita, at the ANA headquarters and maintenance hangars, with ANA employees serving as extras.

<text>Christopher Mackenzie Priest (14 July 1943 – 2 February 2024) was a British novelist and science fiction writer. His works include &quot;Fugue for a Darkening Island&quot; (1972), &quot;The Inverted World&quot; (1974), &quot;The Affirmation&quot; (1981), &quot;The Glamour&quot; (1984), &quot;The Prestige&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Separation&quot; (2002).

Priest was strongly influenced by the science fiction of H. G. Wells and in 2006 was appointed Vice-President of the international H. G. Wells Society.

==Early life==

Christopher Mackenzie Priest was born in Cheadle, Cheshire, England, on 14 July 1943.

As a child, Priest spent some time holidaying in the English county of Dorset. Here he explored the ancient hillfort of Maiden Castle, near Dorchester, which he would later use as the location for the novel &quot;A Dream of Wessex&quot; (1977). He began writing soon after leaving school and was a full-time freelance writer from 1968 on.

== Career ==
Priest&#x27;s first story, &quot;The Run&quot;, was published in 1966. Formerly an accountant and audit clerk, he became a full-time writer in 1968. One of his early novels, &quot;The Affirmation&quot;, concerns a traumatized man who apparently flips into a delusional world in which he experiences a lengthy voyage to an archipelago of exotic islands. This setting featured in many of Priest&#x27;s short stories, which raises the question of whether the Dream Archipelago is actually a fantasy. The state of mind depicted in this novel is similar to that of the delusional fantasy-prone psychoanalytic patient (&quot;Kirk Allen&quot;) in Robert Lindner&#x27;s &quot;The Fifty-Minute Hour&quot;, or Jack London&#x27;s tortured prisoner in &quot;The Star Rover&quot;.

Priest also dealt with delusional alternate realities in &quot;A Dream of Wessex&quot;, in which a group of experimenters for a British government project are brain-wired to a hypnosis machine and jointly participate in an imaginary but as-real-as-real future in a vacation island off the coast of a Sovietized Britain.

His later novels include &quot;The Islanders&quot; (2011), set in the Dream Archipelago, and &quot;The Adjacent&quot; (2013), a multi-strand narrative with recurring characters.

Of his narrative&#x27;s plot twists, Priest told an interviewer in 1995, &quot;my shocks are based on a sudden devastating reversal of what the reader knows or believes.&quot;

=== Tie-in work===
Priest wrote the tie-in novel to accompany the 1999 David Cronenberg movie &quot;eXistenZ&quot;, which contains themes of the novels &quot;A Dream of Wessex&quot; and &quot;The Extremes&quot;. Such themes include the question of the extent to which we can trust what we believe to be reality and our memories.

Priest was approached to write stories for the 18th and 19th seasons of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The first, &quot;Sealed Orders&quot;, was a political thriller based on Gallifrey commissioned by script editor Douglas Adams; it was eventually abandoned due to script problems and replaced with &quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate&quot;. The second, &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, was also eventually abandoned due to script problems and what Priest perceived as insulting treatment after he was asked to modify the script to include the death of Adric. It was replaced by &quot;Earthshock&quot;. Priest received payment while &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer John Nathan-Turner and script editor Eric Saward were forced to pen a letter of apology for the treatment of the writer.

A film of his novel &quot;The Prestige&quot; was released on 20 October 2006. It was directed by Christopher Nolan and starred Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Despite differences between the novel and screenplay, Nolan was reportedly so concerned the denouement be kept a surprise that the US publisher&#x27;s tie-in edition of the book was blocked from using any images from the film itself.

=== Pseudonyms ===
Priest is known to have used the pseudonyms John Luther Novak and Colin Wedgelock, usually for movie novelisations, and Donald MacKenzie. As well as the &quot;eXistenZ&quot; novelization (which undermined the pseudonym by including Priest&#x27;s biography on the pre-title page), he has novelised the movies &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (as John Luther Novak) and &quot;Short Circuit&quot; (as Colin Wedgelock). Priest co-operated with fellow British science fiction author David Langford on various enterprises under the Ansible brand.

=== Other writing ===
Priest wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; from 2002, largely obituaries of such figures as Robert Sheckley, Stanislaw Lem, Jack Williamson, Diana Wynne Jones, John Christopher and many more.

==Awards and honours==
Priest won the BSFA award for the best novel four times: in 1974 for &quot;Inverted World&quot;; in 1998 for &quot;The Extremes&quot;; in 2002 for &quot;The Separation&quot; and in 2011 for &quot;The Islanders&quot;.

Priest won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction and the World Fantasy Award (for &quot;The Prestige&quot;).

Priest won the BSFA award for short fiction in 1979 for the short story &quot;Palely Loitering&quot;, and was nominated for Hugo Awards in the categories of Best Novel, Best Novella, Best Novelette, and Best Non-Fiction Book (this last for &quot;The Book on the Edge of Forever&quot; (also known as &quot;Last Deadloss Visions&quot;), an exploration of the unpublished &quot;Last Dangerous Visions&quot; anthology). &quot;The Space Machine&quot; won the International SF prize in the 1977 Ditmar Awards The Locus Index to SF Awards: 1977 Ditmar Awards. Priest&#x27;s 1979 essay &quot;The Making of the Lesbian Horse&quot; (published as a Novacon chapbook) takes a humorous look at the roots of his acclaimed novel &quot;Inverted World&quot;. He was guest of honour at Novacon 9 in 1979 and Novacon 30 in 2000, and at the 63rd World Science Fiction Convention in 2005.

In 1983 Priest was named one of the 20 Granta Best of Young British Novelists. In 1988 he won the Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis for &quot;The Glamour&quot; as Best Foreign Fiction Book.

Between 7 November and 7 December 2007, the Chelsea College of Art and Design had an exhibition in its gallery Chelsea Space inspired by Priest&#x27;s novel &quot;The Affirmation&quot;. It followed &quot;themes of personal history and memory (which) through the lens of a more antagonistic and critical form of interpretation, aims to point towards an overtly positive viewpoint on contemporary art practice over any traditional melancholy fixation&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Priest lived in Devon, and later on the Isle of Bute. He was married to writer Lisa Tuttle from 1981 to 1987, and from 1988 to 2011 to Leigh Kennedy, with whom he had twins. He later lived with speculative fiction writer Nina Allan until his death, by which time Allan had become his wife.

Priest died from small-cell carcinoma on 2 February 2024, at the age of 80.

<text>Mahalaxmi is an upscale, affluent neighbourhood in the city of Mumbai, India. It is known for Royal Western India Turf Club’s Mahalaxmi Racecourse with horse races every year having visitors from around the world. It is particularly well-known for housing the majestic Mahalaxmi Temple, dedicated to the Hindu goddess of wealth and fortune. Magnificent views can be had of Malabar Hill and the Arabian Sea, two well-known locations.

==History==
Mahalaxmi Temple is one of the most famous temples in Mumbai. Built around 1785, the history of this temple is supposedly connected with the building of the Hornby Vellard. Supposedly, after portions of the sea-wall of the Vellard collapsed twice, the chief engineer, a Pathare Prabhu, dreamed of a Lakshmi statue in the sea near Worli. An underwater search recovered it and he subsequently constructed a temple for it. After this, the work on the Vellard was completed without any problems. 

Mahalaxmi is also home to the Mahalaxmi Racecourse.

<text>British Columbia Highway 14, named the West Coast (Sooke) Highway is the southernmost numbered route in the province of British Columbia. An east–west highway on the southwestern coast of Vancouver Island in the Capital Regional District, it is sometimes known as the &quot;Juan de Fuca Highway&quot;, as well as &quot;Sooke Road&quot;, Sooke being one of the largest communities that the highway passes through. Highway 14 first opened in 1953, extending west from Colwood, a suburb of Victoria, to the coastal community of Jordan River, and was extended all the way west to the remote community of Port Renfrew by 1975. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus was relocated to northern Langford in 2002.

Outside of urban areas the route has exceptionally winding, curving and hilly stretches. Some of the sharper corners have oversized, freeway-style, jersey barriers instead of the more typical steel crash rails, mostly to prevent an out-of-control vehicle from falling off a cliff into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Some bridges are single lane and were built corduroy road style.

==Route details==
The total length of Highway 14 is . In the east, Highway 14 begins at an interchange with the Trans-Canada Highway (Exit 14) in north Langford, proceeding south for as the four-lane Veterans Memorial Parkway through the community of Langford. The highway then turns west as the two-lane Sooke Road, continuing through Langford and Metchosin for . At the signalized Westshore Parkway intersection, the highway becomes four lanes for 
3.5km before returning to 2 lanes. A short 1.4km four-lane, divided standard upgrade to the highway was completed in 2023 with an interchange at Gillespie Road (Exit 31), providing access to East Sooke. The highway passes by a local hill known as Mount Helmcken, before entering Sooke. After Sooke, Highway 14 proceeds west for to Jordan River, hugging the coastline for most of the distance. Highway 14 then travels west northwest along the southwestern coast of the Island for , finally terminating at a Department of Fisheries and Oceans dock in the town of Port Renfrew.

Prior to realignment in 2002, Highway 14 travelled through Colwood from the junction of Old Island Highway (former Highway 1A) and Goldstream Avenue to its current intersection with Veterans Memorial Parkway.

<text>A vert ramp is a form of half-pipe used in extreme sports such as vert skating, vert skateboarding, vert BMX and vert roller skating. 

Vert ramps are so named because they transition from a horizontal plane (known as the flat-bottom) to a vertical section on top.

The typical height of a vert ramp is to with anywhere from to of vertical on top.

Vert skating ramps can be made with to of vertical while vert skateboarding ramps are typically made with 1ft to of vertical in order for the skateboard to launch straight up into the air.

This vertical section makes it easier for the riders to take off and &#x27;catch air&#x27; on a vert ramp rather than on a half-pipe. 
This is because the vert at the top causes the rider to naturally go straight up into the air instead of forward and off the ramp 
(as is the tendency on half-pipes that don&#x27;t go vertically upwards).

<text>Colaba (; or ISO: Kolābā) is a part of the city of Mumbai, India. It is one of the four peninsulas of Mumbai while the other three are Worli, Bandra and Malabar Hill. During the Portuguese rule in the 16th century, the island was known as Kolbhat. After the British took over the island in the late 17th century, it was known as Kolio.

==History==

The name Colaba comes from &quot;Kolabhat&quot;, a word in the language of Kolis, the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, before the arrival of the Portuguese. The area that is now Colaba was originally a region consisting of two islands: Colaba and Little Colaba (or Old Woman&#x27;s Island). The island of Colaba was one of the Seven Islands of Mumbai ruled by the Portuguese.

The Portuguese had acquired these lands from the Sultanate of Cambay by the Treaty of Vasai (1534). The group of islands was given by Portugal to Charles II of England as a dowry when he married Catherine of Braganza in 1661. The cession of Mumbai and dependencies was strongly resented by Portuguese officials in Goa and Mumbai, who resisted transfer of possession for several years, while the English representatives were confined to the island of Anjediva while negotiations continued. Angered by the back-tracking, Charles II leased these lands to the British East India Company for a nominal annual rent. Gerald Aungier, second Governor (1672), and the president of the English settlement of Surat, took possession of the Colaba and Old Woman&#x27;s Island on behalf of the Company in 1675.

Portugal continued to hold Little Colaba island for several decades more before ceding it to the English in about 1762, subject to the retention of Portuguese ownership of a house on the island, that is now the Blessed Sacrament Chapel in Middle Colaba. This was leased by the Portuguese Government of Goa to the Bishop of Damao, the head of the Padroado party in Mumbai, as his residence. After an attempt by the Propaganda Fide party to seize the chapel, a court ruled that the house remained the property of the Government of Portugal and evicted the Propaganda Fide party.


In 1743, British Colaba was leased to Richard Broughton at Rs. 200 yearly, and the lease was renewed in 1764. By 1796, Colaba had become a cantonment. Colaba was known for the variety of fishes – the bombil (Bombay duck), rawas, halwa, turtles, crabs, prawns and lobsters.

A Colaba Observatory, a meteorological observatory was established in 1826 in the part that was called Upper Colaba. The Colaba Causeway was completed in 1838, and thus, the remaining two islands were joined to the others. Gradually, Colaba became a commercial center, after the Cotton Exchange was opened at Cotton Green in 1844. The real estate prices in the area went up. The Colaba Causeway was widened in 1861 and 1863.
Colaba became a separate municipality ward in 1872. The Sick Bungalows (now known as INHS Asvini) were built in the 19th century. The construction of the Afghan Church after the First Afghan War of 1838) began in 1847. The Church was consecrated in 1858, with the work on the steeple being concluded in 1865.

The horse-drawn tram-cars were introduced in 1873 by Stearns and Kitteredge, who had their offices on the west side of the Causeway, where the Electric House now stands.

The Prong&#x27;s lighthouse was constructed at the southern tip of the island in 1875. The eponymous Sassoon Docks were built by David Solomon Sassoon on reclaimed land in the same year. The BB&amp;CI Railways established the Colaba railway station or terminus, the site of which is now occupied by the Badhwar Park layout. The development of Colaba pushed the native kolis to the edges of the island.

The Mumbai City Improvement Trust reclaimed around on the western shore of Colaba. Eminent citizens of Mumbai, such as Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, opposed the work, fearing that the reclamation would depress prices of land. However, the reclamation work continued and was completed in 1905. There was no fall in the land prices. In 1906, a seafront road with a raised sea-side promenade was completed, and named as &quot;Cuffe Parade&quot; after T. W. Cuffe of the Trust.

== Present day ==
The Gateway of India, the art deco style Regal Theatre, the cafes (Café Mondegar, Cafe Royal and Leopold Cafe), and the Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower, Royal Bombay Yacht Club, Bademiya Restaurant and Bagdadi restaurant, as well as a number of modern pubs, restaurants and clubs all add to the atmosphere. The southern tip is occupied by a military cantonment, including the large Navy Nagar layout built on reclaimed land known as Holiday Camp. The older parts of the cantonment retains its large, wooded spaces and is the only bit of green left in this otherwise congested area. In the midst of Navy Nagar lies the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), one of India&#x27;s leading scientific institutions. Colaba is renowned for high-end boutiques and imitation consumer goods, and is popular with tourists. Notable residents include Ratan Tata, Anil Ambani, and Ravi Shastri. Colaba Causeway, or just &quot;Causeway&quot; as it is known in Mumbai, offers everything from bracelets to perfumes to clothes to watches, clocks, DVDs and CDs. It has an old English charm and a very modern feel as well. Colaba is also the art center of Mumbai, with all the major galleries and museums located in and around this area. Even today, in 2020, the government has managed to preserve most of its colonial-era architectures.
Colaba is home to the Cooperage Football Ground.

<text>Mary Doreen Archer, Baroness Archer of Weston-super-Mare, (; born 22 December 1944) is a British scientist specialising in solar power conversion. She is married to Jeffrey Archer, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. Archer is the current Chancellor of the University of Buckingham.

==Early life and education==
Mary Weeden was born in Epsom, Surrey, in December 1944. She was the younger daughter of Harold N. Weeden, a chartered accountant, and Doreen Cox. She attended Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College, before studying chemistry at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford. She went on to study for a PhD in physical chemistry at Imperial College London. Her thesis was titled &quot;Heterogeneous catalysis of inorganic substitution reactions&quot; and was submitted in 1968.

==Career==
Archer was a junior research fellow at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, from 1968 to 1971. She was then a temporary lecturer in chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford for the 1971/72 academic year. After Oxford, she worked as a scientific researcher under George Porter at the Royal Institution in London. It was during this period that she became interested in photoelectrochemistry, and has since written and lectured extensively on the subject.

In the mid-1970s, she was appointed to the board of directors of the International Solar Energy Society. Between 1976 and 1986, she was a fellow of Newnham College and a lecturer in chemistry at Trinity College of the University of Cambridge. From 1984 to 1991, she was a director of the Fitzwilliam Museum Trust in Cambridge. She was a non-executive director of Mid Anglia Radio plc between 1988 and 1995. She sings first alto and in 1992 released a CD of Christmas carols, titled &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. In 1988, Archer joined the Council of Lloyds Insurance Company, becoming chair of the Lloyds Hardship Committee the following year. She had been a Lloyds &#x27;Name&#x27; since 1977.

From 1988 to 2000, she was chair of the National Energy Foundation, which promotes improving the use of energy in buildings. She later became its president and is currently its patron. She is also president of the UK Solar Energy Society (UK-ISES). Weeden is also a Companion of the Energy Institute and was awarded the institute&#x27;s Melchett Medal in 2002.

She has written and contributed to various volumes of work concerning solar energy, including &quot;Photochemical &amp; Photoelectrochemical Approaches to Solar Energy Conversion&quot;, which took 15 years to write. She co-edited &quot;Clean Electricity from Photovoltaics&quot; (2001); &quot;Molecular to Global Photosynthesis&quot; (2004); &quot;The 1702 Chair of Chemistry at Cambridge: Transformation and Change&quot; (2005) and &quot;Nanostructured and Photoelectrochemical Systems for Solar Photon Conversion&quot; (2008).

In 1994 Lady Archer was a non-executive director of Anglia Television at a time when it was the target of a takeover bid. Following reports from the London Stock Exchange, the Department of Trade and Industry appointed inspectors on 8 February 1994 to investigate possible insider trading contraventions by certain individuals, including her husband. No charges were brought.

She was chair of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (incorporating Addenbrooke&#x27;s and the Rosie Hospitals) for 10 years until 2012, having previously been a non-executive director (1993–99), and vice-chair (1999–2002) of Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital NHS Trust. Between 2005 and 2008, she led a pioneer NHS-funded initiative to create patient decision aids for patients with localised prostate cancer (or BPH). In 2007 she was awarded the Eva Philbin Award of the Institute of Chemistry of Ireland. She was founder director of Cambridge University Health Partners, 2009–2012, and was deputy chair of ACT (Addenbrooke&#x27;s Charitable Trust) from 1997 to 2015. She is currently leading a group to create an online PDA and information/advice for bladder cancer patients in Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital, and across the Anglia Cancer Network.

On 24 February 2020, Archer was installed as chancellor of the University of Buckingham.

Archer served as a trustee of the Science Museum Group from 1990 to 2000, and was appointed its chair in 2015.

==Honours==
Archer was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to the National Health Service.

In December 2013, a new link road was opened in Cambridge connecting the Addenbrooke&#x27;s Road to the southern side of the hospital opposite the Rosie extension. This road was named &quot;Dame Mary Archer Way&quot; in recognition of the achievements of the former chairman.

==Personal life==
She married Jeffrey Archer in July 1966, having met him at Oxford University, where he had been studying for a diploma in education. They have two children: William and James.

The Archers live in the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, near Cambridge.

In the summer of 1974, the Archers were struck by a financial crisis when Jeffrey lost over £400,000 in a bad investment. Faced with the threat of bankruptcy, the Archers were forced to move out of their large house in The Boltons. Mary took up a teaching post at Cambridge University which, together with her husband&#x27;s eventual success as a novelist, saved them from financial ruin.

In 1987 she gave evidence at the High Court in a libel case brought by her husband against the &quot;Daily Star&quot; newspaper, which had correctly reported that he had hired a sex worker, with whom he had sexual intercourse. In 2001, when Jeffrey Archer was prosecuted for having committed perjury and for perverting the course of justice in the 1987 trial, she appeared at the Old Bailey as a defence witness. Jeffrey Archer was subsequently convicted and imprisoned for perjury and perverting the course of justice. The trial judge, Mr Justice Potts, questioned the veracity of Mary Archer&#x27;s evidence, suggesting that she too had perjured herself. However, no further action was taken.

In 2003, she sued her former personal assistant, Jane Williams over her breach of confidentiality. Archer was granted a permanent injunction against Williams plus £2,500 damages, for her claim she misappropriated confidential documents about the Archer family, and had contracted the sale of the personal information to the media which was then published by the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; newspaper. Williams had taken Archer to an industrial tribunal on a complaint of unfair dismissal. The complaint was dismissed by the panel in 2002.

Between 1991 and 1999 she sat on the council of The Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College.

In 2011 she said she had recently undergone major surgery for bladder cancer.

<text>Paycor Stadium, previously known as Paul Brown Stadium, is an outdoor football stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. It is the home venue of the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL) and opened on August 19, 2000.

Originally named after the Bengals&#x27; founder, Paul Brown, the stadium is currently sponsored by Paycor, is located on approximately of land, and has a listed seating capacity of 65,515. The stadium is nicknamed &quot;The Jungle&quot;; the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, is the team&#x27;s unofficial anthem due in part to the nickname.

The construction of the stadium included $555 million of public funding, the largest public subsidy for an NFL stadium at the time. The Bengals had threatened to leave Cincinnati unless the city agreed to subsidize the stadium. In 2011, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described the stadium deal as &quot;unusually lopsided in favor of the team and risky for taxpayers.&quot; Since then, additional costs have been imposed on taxpayers related to the stadium. By one estimate, taxpayers will have paid $1.1 billion by 2026, the year in which the 26-year deal expires.

==History==

In 1996, Hamilton County voters passed a one-half percent sales tax increase to fund the building of two new home venues for both the Bengals and MLB&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds. The Bengals and the Reds previously shared tenancy of Riverfront Stadium, later known as Cinergy Field, but both teams complained that the aging multipurpose facility lacked modern amenities and other things necessary for small-market teams to thrive and survive. Construction of the replacements for Cinergy Field began with the groundbreaking for the then-Paul Brown Stadium in 1998; the stadium was completed in time for the 2000 NFL season and opened in August of that year. Cinergy Field would then spend two seasons as a partially-demolished, baseball-only facility (the construction of Great American Ball Park necessitating this) before what was left of it was imploded in December 2002.

For its first four years, the field was natural Kentucky Bluegrass, but maintenance problems arose, and at one point it was rated as the third worst field in the league. Hamilton County explored other options and chose the synthetic FieldTurf system. The infilled artificial turf looks and feels like real grass and, since the field markings are sewn into the fabric, repainting between games is unnecessary. The reduced maintenance saved the county approximately US$100,000 annually. Additionally, it opens Paycor Stadium to other uses without worry of damage to the turf. The FieldTurf was installed for the 2004 season. The field is one of only two stadiums in the NFL to have &quot;five miles of piping&quot; running under the field to keep the rubber inlays heated. In April 2012, the stadium chose to update the playing surface with an installation of Act Global synthetic turf. In 2018, the stadium was equipped with a new top-of-the-line synthetic turf system. Manufactured by Shaw Sports Turf, the product includes Strenexe XD slit-film fibers that are supported by synthetic turf backing, UltraLoc. In response to player safety concerns, the Cincinnati Bengals announced in February 2024 that the stadium would be returning to the FieldTurf system, but upgrading to the newer FieldTurf CORE version, becoming the 8th NFL franchise to do so.
Two LED video displays at either end zone, installed in 2000, provide a good view of the on-field action for every spectator. Over of ribbon display were installed along the fascia of the stadium. The scoreboards and ribbons were later upgraded after the 2014 off-season to larger HD models.

On August 9, 2022, the stadium entered a naming rights agreement with Paycor HCM Inc., a Cincinnati-based company founded by Robert J. Coughlin, expanding the company&#x27;s sponsorship deal with the Bengals that saw the stadium renamed Paycor Stadium, with the company paying an undisclosed sum for 16 years of naming rights. This made Lambeau Field the only stadium named after a person in the league, and made it, along with Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field, the only two stadiums without a naming rights partner in the NFL.

==Notable events==
===College football===
The Cincinnati Bearcats from the University of Cincinnati and the Ohio State Buckeyes from Ohio State University played the first college football game at the stadium on September 21, 2002, before a sold-out crowd of 66,319. On September 5, 2009, the Kentucky Wildcats and the Miami Redhawks played their opening games there. The University of Cincinnati also played Oklahoma in 2010 at the stadium. The Sooners won the game 31–29 with 58,253 fans in attendance. In 2011 the Bearcats played Big East Conference opponents Louisville Cardinals and West Virginia Mountaineers at the stadium. The Bearcats returned to the stadium for the 2014 football season due to renovations of Nippert Stadium, with the largest attendance being Miami (OH) at 41,926. The average attendance was 28,840 for the year. On September 8, 2018, Miami (OH) hosted the Bearcats at the stadium for their annual Victory Bell rivalry, which will also feature games at Paycor Stadium in 2022 and 2026.

===Concerts===
The Cincinnati Music Festival (formerly the Cincinnati Jazz Festival) is held there every year.

===Other events===
Unusual for a venue of its size, Paycor Stadium hosts the annual Queen City Classic Chess Tournament in the spring.

==Features==
Paycor Stadium also houses the Bengals&#x27; administrative offices and training and practice facilities. The game field at Paycor Stadium is Momentum Pro, manufactured by Show Sports Turf. There are three smaller practice fields nearby. Two are sodded with natural grass, while the third is equipped with AstroTurf.

Several local busing companies offer round trip transportation to Paycor Stadium from designated locations throughout the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky area. One such example is the Cincinnati Metro&#x27;s Jungle-to-Jungle Express, which originates at Jungle Jim&#x27;s International Market in Fairfield, a suburb of Cincinnati.

Premium seating options are available in 114 private suites and 7,600 club seats. Amenities include in-seat food and beverage service and access to the club lounges for fine dining options.

On-site retail merchandise sales are available in the Bengals pro shop, located on the plaza level on the north end of the stadium. There are 56 concession stands and eight stores.

==Architecture==
The stadium was designed by architectural firm NBBJ, led by Dan Meis. It was the first NFL facility to win an AIA design award, and one of only two sports venues to be honored. The open corners allow for views into the stadium, while stadium fans can view the downtown skyline and bridges crossing the Ohio River.

Paycor Stadium is the only football stadium to make a list of &quot;America&#x27;s favorite 150 buildings and structures&quot;, according to a Harris Interactive survey. It ranked 101st on the list, whose range included all manner of major structures — skyscrapers, museums, churches, hotels, bridges, national memorials and more. No other football stadium was voted among the top 150, and among all sports venues, only Wrigley Field (31) and Yankee Stadium (84) ranked higher.

<doc id="626624" wikidata="Q3539796" url="?curid=626624" title="Mumbai Central railway station">
<text>Mumbai Central (formerly Bombay Central, station code: MMCT) is a major railway station on the Western line, situated in Mumbai, Maharashtra in an area known by the same name. It serves as a major stop for both local and intercity trains with separate platforms between them. It is also a terminal for several long-distance trains including the Mumbai Rajdhani Express.

It is one of the five major terminal stations in Mumbai, the others being Mumbai CSMT, Mumbai LTT, Bandra and Dadar. Trains depart from the station connecting various destinations mostly across states in the northern, western and north-western parts of India. The station was renamed from &quot;Bombay Central&quot; to &quot;Mumbai Central&quot; in 1997, following the change of Bombay to Mumbai. In October 2017, Western Railway announced that the station code would change from &quot;BCT&quot; to &quot;MMCT&quot; on 1 February 2018.

==History==
The Bombay Central station was built in response to the government directive to demolish the Churchgate-Colaba rail section owing to land reclamation needs. The BB&amp;CI had to agree to this back in the 1870s, when it had extended the line to Colaba, when the permission to build the terminus was provided on the condition that in the event of any further reclamation schemes, the railway company would shift its railway to any other location between Marine Lines and Colaba. The railway was provided a notice about the directed demolition in 1920. The BB&amp;CI could not do this until a new terminus was found. A new station was completed of the name &quot;Bombay Central&quot; on 18 December 1930, and Colaba Terminus went defunct after the 31st December of the same year.

The Station was designed by the British architect Claude Batley, and constructed by the Shapoorji Pallonji in 1930 in a record time of 21 months. The project was then costed INR 15.6 million. The station opened on 18 December 1930.

When the station opened in 1930, &quot;The Times of India&quot; suggested that the name Bombay Central was inspired by the Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The paper argued that the station should have been called Kamathipura, after the area it was located in. The paper suggested that the name Kamathipura was probably ruled out, because the area is a red-light district.

The Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway extended its reach from Baroda to Pathankot via Delhi. The Colaba-Ballard Pier railway station proved insufficient in meeting the demands of a growing population which led the government to make plans for the construction of Bombay Central.

The present suburban route that once ran till Colaba was earlier served by Bellasis Road station. It was renamed Bombay Central (local) after the construction of the long-distance Bombay Central Terminus (BCT) on the eastern side. In October 2017, Western Railway announced that the station code would change from &quot;BCT&quot; to &quot;MMCT&quot; on 1 February 2018. The change in station code caused problems for people making advanced bookings using the IRCTC app during November 2017.

==Infrastructure==

===Platforms and layout===
The station has a total of 9 platforms: 5 mainline platforms and 4 subdivision line platforms. The station is divided into two parts. The eastern half of the station serves long-distance trains operated by Western Railways while the western half serves commuter trains running on the Churchgate–Virar suburban section of Western Railways. The mainline section has five high-level platforms terminating in a large concourse on the southern end. The suburban section has four high-level platforms. All the platforms are connected by foot overbridges and the mainline platforms are wheelchair accessible from the south end.

===Tickets and reservation===
A large Passenger Reservation Center with several ticket windows is located on the east side of the mainline station. Tickets between any two stations in India on any train offering reserved accommodation can be purchased from this facility. There are many Unreserved Ticket Counters in the main concourse for purchasing unreserved tickets for immediate travel on express and passenger trains starting from Mumbai Central. The west and south exits of the suburban section of the station have ticket windows for purchasing tickets for travel on the suburban trains. Suburban train tickets can also be purchased from automatic ticket vending machines (ATVMs) located at several locations in the station premises.

===Food and other facilities===
The concourse on the mainline side has an outlet of Rajdhani chain of restaurants serving authentic Indian food.

Bellasis Rail Café at Mumbai Central is located on the first floor near Bellasis Road overbridge connecting Mumbai Central station near the south end booking office. Items in this café are available in food packets, with ready to take away facility.

There are several stalls in the concourse and on the suburban platforms serving snacks, chips, bottled water and cold drinks (soda). There are book stalls in the main concourse and on the suburban platforms selling newspapers, magazines and other reading material. Train timetables are also available at the book stalls. Restrooms (toilets) are available in the concourse on the mainline side.

===Gardens===
There are two gardens located outside the station. One of the gardens houses a historic locomotive, popularly known as the &quot;Little red horse&quot;. The locomotive was built by English firm Kerr Stuart and Co. in 1928. The engine operated on the Devgarh-Baria Railway Narrow Gauge line, owned by the Princely state of Devgarh-Baria. The line was merged into Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway (BB&amp;CI) in August 1949, and later became part of the Western Railway. The engine served for 61 years, before being transferred to the Pratapnagar workshop for shunting duties in 1990. It was placed at the garden in front of the Mumbai Central station in 1991 to commemorate its platinum jubilee.

===WiFi Services===

RailTel, the telecom arm of the Indian Railways, on 22 January 2016 launched free public Wi-Fi service at Mumbai Central station in collaboration with Google.

&quot;We are delighted to launch India&#x27;s first high-speed public Wi-Fi service in partnership with Indian Railways&quot;, Google South East Asia and India VP &amp; Managing Director Rajan Anandan said.

<doc id="626625" wikidata="Q11659877" url="?curid=626625" title="HMS Cadiz (D79)">
<text>HMS &quot;Cadiz&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. She was named after the Battle of Cádiz, in which the French besieged the Spanish town in 1810, which was eventually lifted in 1812 after the French defeat at the Battle of Salamanca.

She was transferred to the Pakistan Navy in 1956, and commissioned as PNS &quot;Khaibar&quot;. She was sunk off her home port of Karachi by the Indian Navy missile boat, during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.

==History in the Royal Navy==
&quot;Cadiz&quot; was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company. She was launched on 16 September 1944 and commissioned on 12 April 1946.

Upon her commissioning, &quot;Cadiz&quot; joined the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet. In 1947, &quot;Cadiz&quot;, along with her sister ship , escorted the aircraft carrier to Norway, where the small group visited a variety of ports in the Scandinavian country. In 1950, &quot;Cadiz&quot; along with many other vessels of the Home Fleet, including three aircraft carriers and the battleship , undertook a Spring Cruise, visiting the Mediterranean where they performed a number of naval exercises as well as visiting a variety of ports in the region. In 1953, &quot;Cadiz&quot; took part in the Coronation Review to celebrate the Coronation of Elizabeth II. &quot;Cadiz&quot; was positioned in the middle of her sister-ships and . In the same year, &quot;Cadiz&quot; was placed in Reserve, along with the rest of the ships in the 5th Destroyer Squadron.

==History in the Pakistan Navy==

On 29 February 1956 the Admiralty announced that &quot;Cadiz&quot; was being sold to the Pakistan Navy. She was refitted and modernized with funds made available by the United States Mutual Defence Assistance Programme and commissioned as PNS &quot;Khaibar&quot;. The refit was undertaken by Alex Stephens and Sons Ltd, Govan, Glasgow. She was handed over to the Pakistan Navy on 1 February 1957.

===The sinking of PNS &quot;Khaibar&quot;===

During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, the Indian Navy launched a fast naval strike on the Pakistani Naval Headquarters of Karachi. On the night of 4 December 1971 as a part of Operation Trident, a task group consisting of 3 s from the 25th &quot;Killer&quot; Missile Boat Squadron, , , and , escorted by two anti-submarine s, and . approached Karachi.

At 2150 hrs, when the task group was south of Karachi, they detected Pakistani naval vessels. &quot;Nirghat&quot; launched 2 SS-N-2 Styx missiles on the largest target, which was &quot;Khaibar&quot;, 45 miles to its northwest. Both missiles struck the destroyer, sinking it. &quot;Khaibar&quot; went down with most hands on board. A Pakistani minesweeper, , was also sunk and another destroyer, was severely damaged, later scrapped as a result. The missile boats then hit the fuel storage tanks at Karachi Harbour, setting them ablaze.
