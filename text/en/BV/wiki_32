<doc id="616887" wikidata="Q7752972" url="?curid=616887" title="The Müller-Fokker Effect">
<text>The Müller-Fokker Effect is a satirical science fiction novel written by John Sladek in 1970. The first UK edition was published by Hutchinson with cover design by Bill Botten. It has long been out of print in the United States, having come out in a Pocket Books edition in 1973. A reprint was done in 1990 by Carroll &amp; Graf. The title is a pun with the insult &quot;motherfucker&quot;, and the book itself is suffused with wordplay of all stripes.

==Synopsis==
The time is &quot;somewhere in the near future&quot; from the 1970s, and Bob Shairp is a government worker for a project in which a human being&#x27;s individual qualities can be stored as computer data — on Müller-Fokker tapes.

These reel-to-reel tapes, flesh pink in color, can store an entire person&#x27;s identity in four tapes. The people recorded on the tapes can be reconstructed by encoding the tapes&#x27; data into a virus and infecting someone with that virus (see &quot;mind uploading&quot;). Of course, that person would have to be backed up too, and a game of musical chairs is set in motion.

Bob Shairp is being recorded for test purposes on the tapes when there is an accident and the chair he is sitting in explodes, destroying his body. Only from the tapes can he be resurrected.

This somewhat conventional science-fiction premise is something of a MacGuffin, as the novel&#x27;s other major characters struggle to possess the Müller-Fokker tape in numerous subplots that satirize various prominent forces in 1970s America, including the military, evangelism, men&#x27;s magazines, and radical anticommunist groups such as the John Birch Society. The novel also focuses heavily on parallels between the right-wing politics of Sladek&#x27;s time and Nazism: one main character is closely based on Adolf Hitler, recast as a semi-literate American racist obsessed with African Americans.

==Reception==
&quot;Locus&quot; editor Charles N. Brown described it as &quot;a Vonnegut-type black humor novel that starts out very well but goes on much too long with much too much crammed into it.&quot; However, he said &quot;the first 100 pages are really excellent.&quot;
&quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot; critic P. Schuyler Miller noted &quot;it was like Ron Goulart&#x27;s farces, only with more cutting edge—let&#x27;s say, Goulart programmed by a Swift tape.&quot;
In 1970 the public reception of the book however was low, and Sladek stopped writing science fiction novels that decade.

==Translations==
The book received an early German translation as (1970), published by W. Gebühr and was also translated into French as (1974) and published by Éditions Opta.

==In pop culture==
In the comic book series &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;, a character is seen reading the novel.

==Trivia==
The book&#x27;s original blurb reads: &quot;This, and only this, is the genuine novel of our time. Accept no imitations.&quot;

Presciently, though in a satirical context, the US president is Ronald Reagan.

The cover of the French translation of the book, published by Editions Opta, includes an image of comic book character Spider-Man shooting heroin.

<text>The Cleveland Dam is a concrete dam at the head of the Capilano River in Upper Capilano, North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada that holds back Capilano Lake, also known as Capilano reservoir. Part of the Capilano River Regional Park, it stores a portion of the Lower Mainland&#x27;s drinking water. It captures water from one of the three Metro Vancouver watersheds. Construction was started in 1951 and completed in 1954.

The dam is named after engineer Ernest Albert Cleveland who envisioned the need for the proper maintenance of a pristine and efficient water supply as well as sustainable use of water resources. He served as the first chief commissioner of the Greater Vancouver Water District from 1926 until his death in 1952.

==Accidents==
The Cleveland Dam had several failures of the drum gate, causing water to be uncontrollably released into the Capilano River running through Capilano River Regional Park. Warning sirens were not installed until after the death of two men in 2020.

In 1975, a nine-year-old girl was killed by a surge of water released from the dam. The area had no warning signs or alarm at the time. Signs were later added to warn visitors of the potential hazards of the dam.

In 2001, four fishermen were trapped in the river when the water level surged without a warning after the spillway&#x27;s drum gate inadvertently dropped open. WorkSafeBC issued several orders to reduce the risk to workers and the public, including but not limited to: &quot;spillway gate lockout, access to the riverway by workers where lockout is not required, mancheck systems, emergency rescue and evacuation, public warning signage, and warning alarms&quot;. However, some of the orders were ignored and public-facing warning alarms were never installed.

On October 1, 2020, the dam&#x27;s drum gate opened unexpectedly during maintenance, causing water to gush out onto Capilano River. The torrent of water killed one person with another person missing and presumed dead. Several park goers were trapped within Capilano River Regional Park. While many managed to escape by themselves, four people had to be rescued. The Capilano River&#x27;s water level rapidly increased by , pushing of water per second at its recorded peak. These flow rates normally only occur in the rainy season. The anglers at the river edge had no warning except the sound of rushing water as the dam has no public alarm system to warn of a water surge. The popular recreation site had many people scrambling to get out of the way while others in safe areas witnessed their rush to escape. After this accident, warning sirens were installed at three locations along the river.

==In popular culture==
The dam is prominently featured in the &quot;Smallville&quot; episode &quot;Leech,&quot; where Clark Kent loses his powers via a lightning strike while attempting to save a classmate from jumping from the dam, as well as in the episode &quot;Dichotic&quot; in the second season. The dam is portrayed in two episodes of the 1996 TV series The Sentinel. It is also featured in the second-season episode of the series &quot;Supernatural&quot;, titled &quot;Simon Said&quot;. A Cadillac goes over the dam into the Capilano River in the film &quot;The 6th Day&quot;. The dam is also a central location in the film &quot;Bad Girls from Valley High&quot;. The dam and reservoir were also used in &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot;. The Amazon TV series &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; features the dam in several scenes during the first season of the show as a meeting location near Canon City, within the neutral zone.

<doc id="616895" wikidata="Q1858126" url="?curid=616895" title="Trilliaceae">
<text>Trilliaceae was a family of flowering plants first named in 1846; however, most taxonomists now consider the genera formerly assigned to it to belong to the family Liliaceae. The APG IV system, of 2016 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), does not recognize such a family either and assigns the plants involved to family Melanthiaceae, tribe Parideae.

Nevertheless, some taxonomists still recognize a separate family Trilliaceae. The most important genus in North America is &quot;Trillium&quot;, and the taxonomy of that genus has always been controversial.

A recent treatment (Farmer and Schilling 2002) stated that the family Trilliaceae, which exhibits an arcto-tertiary distribution, comprises six genera. Three of these exhibit a wide distribution:
* &quot;Paris&quot; from Iceland to Japan,
* &quot;Daiswa&quot; from eastern Asia, and
* &quot;Trillium&quot; from North America and eastern Asia
Three are monotypic, endemic genera:
* &quot;Trillidium govanianum&quot;, with a tepaloid inflorescence, from the Himalayan Mountains;
* &quot;Kinugasa japonica&quot;, with petaloid sepals, from Japan; and
* &quot;Pseudotrillium rivale&quot;, newly segregated, with spotted petals, from the Siskiyou Mountains of California and Oregon.

Within Melanthiaceae, these are consolidated into three genera;
;Parideae
* &quot;Paris&quot; (including &quot;Daiswa&quot; and &quot;Kinugasa&quot;)
* &quot;Pseudotrillium&quot; 
* &quot;Trillium&quot; (including &quot;Trillidium&quot;)

<text>Kate Roberts (13 February 1891 – 14 April 1985) was one of the foremost Welsh-language authors of the 20th century. Styled (&#x27;The Queen of our Literature&#x27;), she is known mainly for her short stories, but also wrote novels. Roberts was a prominent Welsh nationalist. In 1963, she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Welsh scholar Idris Foster.

==Life==
Kate Roberts was born in the village of , on the slopes of , Caernarfonshire (Gwynedd today). She was the oldest child of Owen Roberts, a quarryman in the local slate industry, and Catrin Roberts. She had two half-sisters and two half-brothers (John Evan, Mary, Jane and Owen) from earlier marriages of her parents, and three younger brothers (Richard, Evan and David). She was born in the family cottage, . Later the life in the cottage and village made an all-important backdrop to her early literary work. Her autobiographical volume is a memorable portrayal of the district in that period.
She attended the council school at from 1895 to 1904, and Caernarfonshire School from 1904 to 1910. She went on to graduate in Welsh at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, which she attended from 1910 to 1913 under John Morris-Jones and Ifor Williams, and trained as a teacher. She taught in various schools in Wales ( Elementary School 1913–1914, County School 1915–1917, and County Girls&#x27; School, Aberdare 1917–1928).

Roberts met Morris T. Williams at Plaid Cymru (the Welsh nationalist party) meetings, and married him in 1928. Williams was a printer, and eventually they bought the printing and publishing house (&#x27;The Gee Press&#x27;), Denbigh, and moved to live in the town in 1935. The press published books, pamphlets and the Welsh-language weekly (&quot;The Banner&quot;), for which Roberts wrote regularly. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1946, she ran the press for another 10 years.

In 1965 Roberts bought Cae&#x27;r Gors and presented it to the nation, but at the time there was not enough money to restore it. It was not restored until 2005, after a long campaign to raise the money. It is now in the care of as a museum presentation of Roberts.

She remained in Denbigh after her retirement and died in 1985. 

=== Sexuality ===
Alan Llwyd&#x27;s 2011 biography of Roberts used diaries and letters to shed fresh light on her private life and her relationship with Morris. Llwyd suggests that Roberts may have had lesbian tendencies. For example, Roberts sent a letter to her husband describing the joy she felt when kissing another woman in , saying that nothing had ever made her more happy.

==Work==

Her first volume of short stories, (&quot;From the Swamp of the Hills&quot;), appeared in 1925. Perhaps her most successful book of short stories is (&quot;Tea in the Heather&quot;, 1959), a series about children. Of the novels that Roberts wrote, the most famous may have been (&quot;Feet in Chains&quot;, 1936), which reflected the hard life of a slate-quarrying family. The book was awarded a prize at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in Neath in 1934. She won the prize jointly with Grace Wynne Griffith and her novel . However it was alleged that was unworthy of the prize according to the historian Thomas Richards.

In 1960 Roberts published , a volume of autobiography.

Most of her novels and short stories are set in the Arfon region where she lived in North Wales. She herself said that she derived the material for her work &quot;from the society in which I was brought up, a poor society in an age of poverty... [where] it was always a struggle against poverty. But notice that the characters haven&#x27;t reached the bottom of that poverty, they are struggling against it, afraid of it.&quot;

Thus her work deals with the uneventful lives of humble people and how they deal with difficulties and disillusionments. It is remarkable for the richness of her language and for her perception. The role of women in society and progressive ideas about life and love are major themes.

Many of her works have been translated into other languages.

Roberts struck up a literary relationship with Saunders Lewis, which they maintained through letters over a period of forty years. These letters give a picture of life in Wales during the period and record the comments of two literary giants on events at home and abroad.

In 1981, &quot;Kate Roberts: Bro a Bywyd&quot;, a book of 101 biographical photos, edited with an introduction by Derek Llwyd Morgan, was published by , Cardiff. The plates include extensive photographs from Kate Roberts&#x27; life, her family, and the places she lived. Also letters, documents, certificates, monuments, and handbills; the text and descriptive captions entirely in Welsh.

<text>Polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(A) tail to an RNA transcript, typically a messenger RNA (mRNA). The poly(A) tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is part of the process that produces mature mRNA for translation. In many bacteria, the poly(A) tail promotes degradation of the mRNA. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.

The process of polyadenylation begins as the transcription of a gene terminates. The 3′-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off by a set of proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA&#x27;s 3′ end. In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing.

The poly(A) tail is important for the nuclear export, translation and stability of mRNA. The tail is shortened over time, and, when it is short enough, the mRNA is enzymatically degraded. However, in a few cell types, mRNAs with short poly(A) tails are stored for later activation by re-polyadenylation in the cytosol. In contrast, when polyadenylation occurs in bacteria, it promotes RNA degradation. This is also sometimes the case for eukaryotic non-coding RNAs.

mRNA molecules in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have polyadenylated 3′-ends, with the prokaryotic poly(A) tails generally shorter and fewer mRNA molecules polyadenylated.

==Background on RNA==
RNAs are a type of large biological molecules, whose individual building blocks are called nucleotides. The name &quot;poly(A) tail&quot; (for polyadenylic acid tail) reflects the way RNA nucleotides are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (&quot;transcribed&quot;) from a DNA template. By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5′ to 3′ direction. The 5′ end is the part of the RNA molecule that is transcribed first, and the 3′ end is transcribed last. The 3′ end is also where the poly(A) tail is found on polyadenylated RNAs.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) is RNA that has a coding region that acts as a template for protein synthesis (&quot;translation&quot;). The rest of the mRNA, the &quot;untranslated regions&quot;, tune how active the mRNA is. There are also many RNAs that are not translated, called non-coding RNAs. Like the untranslated regions, many of these non-coding RNAs have regulatory roles.

==Nuclear polyadenylation==

=== Function ===
In nuclear polyadenylation, a poly(A) tail is added to an RNA at the end of transcription. On mRNAs, the poly(A) tail protects the mRNA molecule from enzymatic degradation in the cytoplasm and aids in transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated, with the exception of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs. These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a poly(A) tail, ending instead in a stem-loop structure followed by a purine-rich sequence, termed histone downstream element, that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3′ end of the histone mRNA is formed.

Many eukaryotic non-coding RNAs are always polyadenylated at the end of transcription. There are small RNAs where the poly(A) tail is seen only in intermediary forms and not in the mature RNA as the ends are removed during processing, the notable ones being microRNAs. But, for many long noncoding RNAs – a seemingly large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates X chromosome inactivation – a poly(A) tail is part of the mature RNA.

===Mechanism===
The processive polyadenylation complex in the nucleus of eukaryotes works on products of RNA polymerase II, such as precursor mRNA. Here, a multi-protein complex &quot;(see components on the right)&quot; cleaves the 3′-most part of a newly produced RNA and polyadenylates the end produced by this cleavage. The cleavage is catalysed by the enzyme CPSF and occurs 10–30 nucleotides downstream of its binding site. This site often has the polyadenylation signal sequence AAUAAA on the RNA, but variants of it that bind more weakly to CPSF exist. Two other proteins add specificity to the binding to an RNA: CstF and CFI. CstF binds to a GU-rich region further downstream of CPSF&#x27;s site. CFI recognises a third site on the RNA (a set of UGUAA sequences in mammals) and can recruit CPSF even if the AAUAAA sequence is missing. The polyadenylation signal – the sequence motif recognised by the RNA cleavage complex – varies between groups of eukaryotes. Most human polyadenylation sites contain the AAUAAA sequence, but this sequence is less common in plants and fungi.

The RNA is typically cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II to slip off of the transcript. Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.

When the RNA is cleaved, polyadenylation starts, catalysed by polyadenylate polymerase. Polyadenylate polymerase builds the poly(A) tail by adding adenosine monophosphate units from adenosine triphosphate to the RNA, cleaving off pyrophosphate. Another protein, PAB2, binds to the new, short poly(A) tail and increases the affinity of polyadenylate polymerase for the RNA. When the poly(A) tail is approximately 250 nucleotides long the enzyme can no longer bind to CPSF and polyadenylation stops, thus determining the length of the poly(A) tail. CPSF is in contact with RNA polymerase II, allowing it to signal the polymerase to terminate transcription. When RNA polymerase II reaches a &quot;termination sequence&quot; (⁵&#x27;TTTATT3&#x27; on the DNA template and ⁵&#x27;AAUAAA3&#x27; on the primary transcript), the end of transcription is signaled. The polyadenylation machinery is also physically linked to the spliceosome, a complex that removes introns from RNAs.

===Downstream effects===
The poly(A) tail acts as the binding site for poly(A)-binding protein. Poly(A)-binding protein promotes export from the nucleus and translation, and inhibits degradation. This protein binds to the poly(A) tail prior to mRNA export from the nucleus and in yeast also recruits poly(A) nuclease, an enzyme that shortens the poly(A) tail and allows the export of the mRNA. Poly(A)-binding protein is exported to the cytoplasm with the RNA. mRNAs that are not exported are degraded by the exosome. Poly(A)-binding protein also can bind to, and thus recruit, several proteins that affect translation, one of these is initiation factor-4G, which in turn recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit. However, a poly(A) tail is not required for the translation of all mRNAs. Further, poly(A) tailing (oligo-adenylation) can determine the fate of RNA molecules that are usually not poly(A)-tailed (such as (small) non-coding (sn)RNAs etc.) and thereby induce their RNA decay.

===Deadenylation===
In eukaryotic somatic cells, the poly(A) tails of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated less and degraded sooner. However, it can take many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation process can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3′ untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored and translationally inactive. These short tailed mRNAs are activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.

In animals, poly(A) ribonuclease (PARN) can bind to the 5′ cap and remove nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level of access to the 5′ cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5′ cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Additionally, RNA triple helix structures and RNA motifs such as the poly(A) tail 3’ end binding pocket retard deadenylation process and inhibit poly(A) tail removal. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5′ cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other proteins are involved in deadenylation in budding yeast and human cells, most notably the CCR4-Not complex.

==Cytoplasmic polyadenylation==
There is polyadenylation in the cytosol of some animal cell types, namely in the germline, during early embryogenesis and in post-synaptic sites of nerve cells. This lengthens the poly(A) tail of an mRNA with a shortened poly(A) tail, so that the mRNA will be translated. These shortened poly(A) tails are often less than 20 nucleotides, and are lengthened to around 80–150 nucleotides.

In the early mouse embryo, cytoplasmic polyadenylation of maternal RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell to survive and grow even though transcription does not start until the middle of the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.

Cytoplasmic polyadenylation requires the RNA-binding proteins CPSF and CPEB, and can involve other RNA-binding proteins like Pumilio. Depending on the cell type, the polymerase can be the same type of polyadenylate polymerase (PAP) that is used in the nuclear process, or the cytoplasmic polymerase GLD-2.

== Alternative polyadenylation ==
Many protein-coding genes have more than one polyadenylation site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3′ end. The 3’ region of a transcript contains many polyadenylation signals (PAS). When more proximal (closer towards 5’ end) PAS sites are utilized, this shortens the length of the 3’ untranslated region (3&#x27; UTR) of a transcript. Studies in both humans and flies have shown tissue specific APA. With neuronal tissues preferring distal PAS usage, leading to longer 3’ UTRs and testis tissues preferring proximal PAS leading to shorter 3’ UTRs. Studies have shown there is a correlation between a gene&#x27;s conservation level and its tendency to do alternative polyadenylation, with highly conserved genes exhibiting more APA. Similarly, highly expressed genes follow this same pattern. Ribo-sequencing data (sequencing of only mRNAs inside ribosomes) has shown that mRNA isoforms with shorter 3’ UTRs are more likely to be translated.

Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3&#x27; UTR, it can also change which binding sites are available for microRNAs in the 3′ UTR. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3′ untranslated region.

The choice of poly(A) site can be influenced by extracellular stimuli and depends on the expression of the proteins that take part in polyadenylation. For example, the expression of CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results in the selection of weak poly(A) sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3′ untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like lysozyme and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins. RNA-binding proteins other than those in the polyadenylation machinery can also affect whether a polyadenylation site is used, as can DNA methylation near the polyadenylation signal. In addition, numerous other components involved in transcription, splicing or other mechanisms regulating RNA biology can affect APA.

==Tagging for degradation in eukaryotes==
For many non-coding RNAs, including tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA, polyadenylation is a way of marking the RNA for degradation, at least in yeast. This polyadenylation is done in the nucleus by the TRAMP complex, which maintains a tail that is around 4 nucleotides long to the 3′ end. The RNA is then degraded by the exosome. Poly(A) tails have also been found on human rRNA fragments, both the form of homopolymeric (A only) and heterpolymeric (mostly A) tails.

==In prokaryotes and organelles==
In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This poly(A) tail promotes degradation by the degradosome, which contains two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3′ end of RNAs and the 3′ extension provided by the poly(A) tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3′ end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation and degradation of the 3′ end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The poly(A) tail can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.

In as different groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising polyadenylation targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The stabilising ones start at the stop codon, and without them the stop codon (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part. Plant mitochondria have only destabilising polyadenylation. Mitochondrial polyadenylation has never been observed in either budding or fission yeast.

While many bacteria and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, they also have another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria, mitochondria, plastids and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea that have an exosome). It can synthesise a 3′ extension where the vast majority of the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.

==Evolution==
Although polyadenylation is seen in almost all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide distribution of this modification and the fact that it is present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium &quot;Mycoplasma gallisepticum&quot; and the salt-tolerant archaean &quot;Haloferax volcanii&quot; lack this modification.

The most ancient polyadenylating enzyme is polynucleotide phosphorylase. This enzyme is part of both the bacterial degradosome and the archaeal exosome, two closely related complexes that recycle RNA into nucleotides. This enzyme degrades RNA by attacking the bond between the 3′-most nucleotides with a phosphate, breaking off a diphosphate nucleotide. This reaction is reversible, and so the enzyme can also extend RNA with more nucleotides. The heteropolymeric tail added by polynucleotide phosphorylase is very rich in adenine. The choice of adenine is most likely the result of higher ADP concentrations than other nucleotides as a result of using ATP as an energy currency, making it more likely to be incorporated in this tail in early lifeforms. It has been suggested that the involvement of adenine-rich tails in RNA degradation prompted the later evolution of polyadenylate polymerases (the enzymes that produce poly(A) tails with no other nucleotides in them).

Polyadenylate polymerases are not as ancient. They have separately evolved in both bacteria and eukaryotes from CCA-adding enzyme, which is the enzyme that completes the 3′ ends of tRNAs. Its catalytic domain is homologous to that of other polymerases. It is presumed that the horizontal transfer of bacterial CCA-adding enzyme to eukaryotes allowed the archaeal-like CCA-adding enzyme to switch function to a poly(A) polymerase. Some lineages, like archaea and cyanobacteria, never evolved a polyadenylate polymerase.

Polyadenylate tails are observed in several RNA viruses, including Influenza A, Coronavirus, Alfalfa mosaic virus, and Duck Hepatitis A. Some viruses, such as HIV-1 and Poliovirus, inhibit the cell&#x27;s poly-A binding protein (PABPC1) in order to emphasize their own genes&#x27; expression over the host cell&#x27;s.

==History==
Poly(A)polymerase was first identified in 1960 as an enzymatic activity in extracts made from cell nuclei that could polymerise ATP, but not ADP, into polyadenine. Although identified in many types of cells, this activity had no known function until 1971, when poly(A) sequences were found in mRNAs. The only function of these sequences was thought at first to be protection of the 3′ end of the RNA from nucleases, but later the specific roles of polyadenylation in nuclear export and translation were identified. The polymerases responsible for polyadenylation were first purified and characterized in the 1960s and 1970s, but the large number of accessory proteins that control this process were discovered only in the early 1990s.

<text>Robert Thorburn Ayton Innes FRSE FRAS (10 November 1861 – 13 March 1933) was a British-born South African astronomer best known for discovering Proxima Centauri in 1915, and numerous binary stars. He was also the first astronomer to have seen the Great January Comet of 1910, on 12 January. He was the founding director of a meteorological observatory in Johannesburg, which was later converted to an astronomical observatory and renamed to Union Observatory. He was the first Union Astronomer. Innes House, designed by Herbert Baker, built as his residence at the observatory, today houses the South African Institute of Electrical Engineers.

==Biography==
He was born on 10 November 1861 in Edinburgh to John and Elizabeth (née Ayton) Innes. He had 11 younger siblings.

A self-taught astronomer, he went to Australia at an early age and made his living as a wine merchant in Sydney, where, using a home made 12-inch reflecting telescope, he discovered several double stars new to astronomy. Innes published a double star catalog in 1900
that assimilated all earlier observations by southern astronomers, to provide the longest baseline for orbit determination. He published another in 1927.
His catalogs were in turn incorporated into later catalogs of all known double stars. He also published some papers on perturbations in Mars&#x27; and Venus&#x27; orbits.

Despite having had no formal training in astronomy, he was invited to the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope by the HM Astronomer Sir David Gill in 1894 and appointed in 1896. While at the Cape, he discovered what is now known as Kapteyn&#x27;s Star which the latter had listed as one of a number included in the Cordoba Durchmusterung but missing from the later Cape Photographic Durchmusterung. Innes found what had happened to it: it has a very large proper motion and had moved considerably during the intervening time interval.

In 1903 he took up the position of Director of the new Transvaal Meteorological Observatory in Johannesburg, which became the Transvaal Observatory in 1906. He acquired the observatory&#x27;s first telescope, a 9-inch Grubb refractor, in 1909, and was appointed first Union Astronomer in 1912 at the establishment of the Union Observatory. The prime telescope from 1925 onwards was a 26.5-inch refractor, ideal for Innes&#x27; continued study of faint visual binary stars.

John Franklin-Adams, a pioneer of astrophotography, presented his 10-inch astrographic camera
to the Union Observatory, which Innes used in the discovery of Proxima Centauri. In 1915, he found a faint star fairly close to and sharing the same large proper motion with Alpha Centauri, which until then was believed to be the closest star system to the Sun. Innes believed, on rather slim evidence, that it was closer than Alpha and in 1917 named it Proxima. He was not able to measure its distance accurately with his 9-inch refractor or the short focus Franklin-Adams astrograph. The definitive distance was measured by Harold Lee Alden at the Yale observatory station in Johannesburg which was equipped with a long focus camera designed for stellar parallax work. Alden&#x27;s more precise measurements confirmed Proxima to be the closest star to the sun. No closer star has been found to date.

Visual double star observation was Innes&#x27; main contribution to astronomy. When he started observing them as an amateur in Australia, the choice plums had already been picked by earlier astronomers, notably James Dunlop and John Herschel. Many of Innes&#x27; discoveries were stars with faint companions that were missed by earlier observers. Most of his labor was the measurement of the relative positions of binary pairs with a filar micrometer. All known doubles were periodically re-measured to determine their orbits. With Thiele, Innes formulated a simplified method of specifying double star orbits. These orbital parameters when combined with other measurements, such as radial velocity allow the mass of each star of the binary pair to be determined. Mass, combined with luminosity and temperature or spectral type, is a fundamental parameter needed in theories of stellar structure and stellar evolution. 
The University of Leyden awarded Innes an honoris causa doctorate in 1923. He retired in 1927. Innes was a first rank chess player. He died suddenly on 13 March 1933 in England while pursuing a 3D cinema idea: He had amused observatory guests with a stereo cinema viewer,
and probably had in mind combining its principle with that of a blink comparator, which he used in finding stars of high proper motion, to make a screen 3D projector.

==Legacy==
Innes tirelessly campaigned for foreign investment in South Africa&#x27;s astronomy infrastructure - he believed that its clear skies were ideally suited for astronomical observation. He discovered some 1600 new pairs of double stars, had a great interest in stellar proper motions and devoted much time to the study of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites.

Once erroneously believed to be one of the closest stars to Earth,
Innes&#x27; star, which Innes discovered, bears his name.

== Honors ==
The following features have been named after him:
* The lunar crater Innes.
* The asteroid 1658 Innes.

<text>William Lawrence Greenly (September 18, 1813November 29, 1883) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan; he served as the sixth governor of Michigan.

==Early life in New York==
Greenly was born in Hamilton, New York. He graduated from Union College of Schenectady, New York in 1831, then studied law with Stower &amp; Gridley in Hamilton and was admitted to the bar at Albany, New York in 1834.

==Politics in Michigan==
Greenly moved to Adrian, Michigan in October 1836. He served as a member of the Michigan State Senate from the 2nd district from 1839 to 1840, and from the 3rd district from 1842 to 1843.

Greenly served as the fifth lieutenant governor of Michigan from 1846 to 1847 and became governor on March 4, 1847, after the resignation of Alpheus Felch to take a seat in the U.S. Senate. He completed Felch&#x27;s term through January 3, 1848. Greenly served through much of the Mexican–American War, where troops from Michigan were sent such as Company K, 3d Dragoons, as well as A, E, and G of the U. S. Infantry.

==Retirement and death==

After his brief time as governor, Greenly served as justice of the peace for 12 years. He was elected mayor of Adrian, Michigan in 1858, serving only one year. Greenly died on November 29, 1883 in Adrian at the age of 70. He is interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Adrian.

<text>William Turner Jr. is a fictional character in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; films. He appears in &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003), &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006), &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007), and &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017). He is portrayed by Orlando Bloom (and as a child by Dylan Smith in the prologue of &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;).

William Turner is a blacksmith&#x27;s apprentice working in Port Royal, Jamaica. He secretly loves the governor&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth Swann (played by Keira Knightley and Lucinda Dryzek), although he occupies a lower social class than she does. Will is the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner, and he works to free his father from service to Davy Jones. He marries Elizabeth Swann in &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, and they have a son named Henry (played by Dominic Scott Kay, Lewis McGowan, and Brenton Thwaites). Alongside Hector Barbossa, Turner serves as an additional foil to Jack Sparrow&#x27;s character, taking the role of the straight man with his subdued, good-natured personality.

Will is the only child of &quot;Bootstrap&quot; Bill Turner (portrayed by Stellan Skarsgaard). According to Jack Sparrow, Will strongly resembles his father, both in appearance and ability. However, his father was absent during his early childhood in England. Will grew up believing his father to be a merchant seaman. Following his mother&#x27;s death, Will, then about twelve years old, emigrated to Port Royal.

===&quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;===

Weatherby Swann and his daughter Elizabeth sail to Port Royal after Weatherby is appointed governor. Elizabeth spots Will clinging to a floating piece of a shipwreck. She discovers a gold medallion around his neck, and hides it to prevent anyone from believing that Will is a pirate. Later Elizabeth finds out the medallion is in fact Cursed Aztec Gold.

Over the next eight years, Will and Elizabeth maintain a respectful friendship, although Will conceals his romantic feelings for her. He is now a blacksmith&#x27;s apprentice in Port Royal. Will has developed into a master craftsman of fine swords, although his often-drunk master usually claims credit for Will&#x27;s exquisite workmanship. Will is also an exceptional, self-taught swordsman. The DVD commentary states that he is the best among the characters in the film, including Barbossa, Norrington, and Jack Sparrow. When Jack Sparrow attempts to evade arrest, Will engages him in a duel. Sparrow outwits Will in a sword fight; Will claims Jack &quot;cheated&quot; by ignoring the &quot;rules of engagement.&quot;

Will learns that his father was the pirate &quot;Bootstrap Bill&quot; Turner, who served aboard the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; when it was commanded by Captain Jack Sparrow. Despite Sparrow&#x27;s comments that Bootstrap was &quot;a good man,&quot; Will remains deeply conflicted over the fact that his father was a pirate. Will learns that when First Mate Barbossa and the crew mutinied and marooned Sparrow, only Bootstrap defended him. Infuriated by Bootstrap&#x27;s betrayal, Barbossa and his crew had looted a chest of Aztec gold. This resulted in them becoming undead and unable to feel physical pleasure. It was only after they had thrown Bootstrap overboard that they learned how to break the curse: they needed to return all of the gold pieces, and each pirate who took the gold had to make a blood offering as a form of repayment. Because Bootstrap only had one child, Barbossa decides to track down and kidnap the child in order to lift the curse.

It is revealed that the pirate&#x27;s medallion stolen by Elizabeth is one of the pieces of Aztec gold. Believing her to be the daughter of Bootstrap Bill, Barbossa kidnaps her. After Elizabeth is kidnapped, Will forms an alliance with Sparrow. He helps Sparrow escape from prison. They commandeer a ship and recruit a crew in Tortuga. They sail to Isla de Muerta, where Barbossa has taken Elizabeth. Unbeknownst to Will, Sparrow intends to use him to bargain back the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;. When Will learns his role in lifting the curse, he barters himself to Barbossa to free Elizabeth and the crew. In the end, Sparrow and Will succeed in lifting the curse; Sparrow kills Barbossa, and the pirate crew is defeated. At Sparrow&#x27;s execution in Port Royal, Will declares his love for Elizabeth before attempting to rescue Sparrow from the gallows. They are quickly subdued by redcoats, but Will refuses to abandon Sparrow. Elizabeth intervenes and saves Will by declaring her love for him and vouching for Sparrow. Will is pardoned, while Sparrow escapes by falling off the rampart and into the bay where the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; awaits.

===&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;===

Will returns with the other main characters from &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. 

For aiding Jack Sparrow&#x27;s escape, Will and Elizabeth are arrested just prior to their wedding ceremony by Lord Cutler Beckett, a man made wealthy and powerful by profits from the East India Trading Company. Beckett threatens Will and Elizabeth with execution for aiding Sparrow&#x27;s escape, but offers clemency if Will can find Sparrow&#x27;s compass for Beckett&#x27;s use. This magical compass will allow Beckett to find the heart of Davy Jones. Beckett also possesses a Letter of Marque with which he intends to recruit Jack as a privateer.

To save Elizabeth, Will hunts for Jack Sparrow and the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;. He finds the crew captive on Pelegosto, a cannibal-inhabited island. They escape, and are unexpectedly reunited with Pintel and Ragetti. Jack agrees to give Will his compass if he helps him find a key, though he has no idea what it unlocks. Jack seeks out Tia Dalma, a voodoo priestess who takes a particular interest in Will, proclaiming he has a &quot;touch of destiny.&quot; Dalma says the key is to the Dead Man&#x27;s Chest containing the heart of Davy Jones. Sparrow had once struck a bargain with Davy Jones to raise the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; from the ocean bottom and to make Jack captain for 13 years. Sparrow would then serve aboard the &quot;Dutchman&quot; for a century. When Jones attempts to collect on this deal, Jack reneges on the bargain.

The crew searches for Jones, and Will soon finds himself stranded on a wrecked vessel that Jack claimed was Jones&#x27; ghost ship, the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. When the real &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; suddenly arrives, Jack attempts to barter Will to Davy Jones to repay his blood debt, but Jones refuses, saying one soul is unequal to another. Instead, he keeps Will as a &quot;good faith&quot; payment and demands an additional 99 souls. Otherwise, Jack must surrender or face the Kraken.
Will, now an indentured sailor aboard Jones&#x27; ghost ship, meets his father &quot;Bootstrap&quot; Bill Turner. When Will challenges Davy Jones to Liar&#x27;s Dice, betting his soul against the key to the &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;, Bootstrap joins in and purposely loses to save his son from eternal enslavement. With Bootstrap&#x27;s help, Will steals the key from Jones and escapes in a longboat, vowing to one day free his father. A passing ship rescues Will, but Jones summons the Kraken to destroy it. Will survives and stows back aboard the &quot;Dutchman,&quot; now headed for Isla Cruces where the Dead Man&#x27;s Chest containing Jones&#x27; heart is buried.

On Isla Cruces, Will is reunited with Elizabeth, who has escaped jail and joined Jack Sparrow&#x27;s crew. Also present are Sparrow and former Commodore James Norrington, who has also joined the crew. They locate the chest. Will, Jack, and Norrington each claim the heart for their own purposes. Norrington ultimately steals the heart and the Letters of Marque, escaping just as Davy Jones&#x27; crew attacks.

The &quot;Black Pearl&quot; flees, outrunning the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, but Davy Jones again summons the Kraken. Will leads the crew in temporarily fending it off, gaining enough time to abandon ship. When Elizabeth realizes that Sparrow is the Kraken&#x27;s sole prey, she distracts him with a passionate kiss while handcuffing him to the mast. Unbeknownst to her, Will witnesses this and believes Elizabeth now loves Sparrow. From the longboat, the crew watches the Kraken drag the &quot;Pearl&quot; and Sparrow to Davy Jones&#x27; Locker.

Will, Elizabeth, and the crew seek refuge with Tia Dalma. Gibbs proposes a toast to their fallen captain, to which Will glumly raises his mug. Seeing Elizabeth&#x27;s tears and believing she loves Sparrow, he tries comforting her. Will and the crew agree to attempt to rescue Sparrow from the Locker.

===&quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;===
Will is next seen in Singapore with Elizabeth, Barbossa, Tia Dalma, and the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; crew. They attempt bargain with Sao Feng, the Pirate Lord of the South China Sea, for the navigational charts leading to World&#x27;s End and Davy Jones&#x27; Locker, so that they can rescue Jack Sparrow. Will had already attempted to steal the charts, but was captured. Ostensibly, the group&#x27;s mission is to rescue Jack Sparrow from the Locker, but, like the others, Will has a secret motive: to retrieve the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and free his father from Davy Jones. When Mercer and the East India Trading Company soldiers attack Sao Feng&#x27;s bathhouse, Feng strikes a secret bargain with Will: Jack Sparrow in exchange for the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;. Will and the others journey to World&#x27;s End on Feng&#x27;s ship, sailing over an enormous waterfall into the Locker. There, they find Jack aboard the &quot;Pearl&quot;. Jack sets sail with them, although he and Barbossa dispute who is captain. Will learns that Elizabeth sacrificed Jack to the Kraken. And though he now understands why Elizabeth has been distant and despondent, she believes that her unrelenting guilt over causing Sparrow&#x27;s doom is her burden alone to bear. Will tells her their relationship will not endure if they lack trust in one another and make their choices alone.

Sao Feng betrays Will in lieu of another bargain with Lord Beckett, though Beckett double-crosses Feng. Feng then offers Barbossa the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; in exchange for Elizabeth, who he mistakenly believes is the sea goddess, Calypso. Elizabeth is stunned that Will betrayed Jack Sparrow to achieve his goal. Ignoring Will, she agrees to Feng&#x27;s terms in exchange for the crew&#x27;s safety. Jack tosses Will in the brig, but he soon escapes. Still plotting to obtain the &quot;Pearl&quot;, Will leaves a trail of bodies for Lord Beckett to follow to Shipwreck Cove, the Brethren Court stronghold. Jack catches him, but surprisingly hands Will his magical compass before pushing him overboard. Clinging to a floating barrel, Will drifts towards Beckett&#x27;s ship, &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

Will is exchanged for Jack during parley with Beckett and Davy Jones. Elizabeth tells Will she now understands the burden he bears, but having been aboard the &quot;Dutchman&quot;, she believes Bootstrap can no longer be saved, although Will disagrees. When Barbossa releases Calypso from her human form, Will tells her that Davy Jones betrayed her to the First Brethren Court. This causes her to turn her fury against both the pirates and Jones, forming a giant maelstrom.

During the maelstrom battle, Will proposes to Elizabeth, convincing her this may be their only opportunity to wed. Barbossa performs an impromptu wedding as the battle continues.

Will defends Elizabeth from Davy Jones. He stabs Jones, but Jones is unharmed. Jones mortally wounds Will. Jack, who now possesses Jones&#x27; heart guides Will&#x27;s hand to stab the heart and kill Jones. Bootstrap carves out his son&#x27;s heart and places it in the Dead Man&#x27;s Chest. Will becomes the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;″s immortal captain. Now under Will&#x27;s command, the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; resurfaces, and the crew has reverted to human form. Will commands the &quot;Dutchman&quot; against the &quot;Endeavour&quot; and the combined firepower of the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; destroy the &quot;Endeavour&quot;, killing Cutler Beckett. The remaining armada retreats without a fight.

Will is now a psychopomp, bound to ferrying souls of those who died at sea to the next world. Will is allowed one day ashore before beginning his ten-year duty aboard the &quot;Dutchman&quot;. Bootstrap Bill decides to remain on the crew with his son. Elizabeth, a mortal, is unable to accompany them. Will spends his one day with Elizabeth on an island where they consummate their marriage. Before returning to the &quot;Dutchman&quot; at sunset, he entrusts the Dead Man&#x27;s Chest containing his beating heart to her care. The &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; disappears from the horizon amid the Green Flash.

Will returns ten years later, where he meets Elizabeth and their son, Henry.

===&quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;===

Orlando Bloom reprises his role as Will Turner in the fifth film, seen with barnacles forming upon his face, implying he&#x27;s failing at the responsibilities as Captain of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. At the start of the film, Henry Turner deliberately attempts to drown himself to lure in the &quot;Dutchman&quot;, believing that he has found a way to cure his father of his curse, but Will rejects this idea, certain that there is no way to free him from his duty, asking Henry to forget him. Nine years later, Jack Sparrow recruits Henry, his small crew, a girl named Carina Smyth (who is secretly the daughter of Barbossa) and Barbossa to help him find the Trident of Poseidon, the destruction of the Trident breaking all curses imposed by the sea, including the curse that binds Will to the &quot;Dutchman&quot;. At the film&#x27;s conclusion, Will is reunited with Elizabeth. In the post-credits sequence, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are asleep when their bedroom is entered by the shadow of an apparently resurrected Davy Jones. Will then awakens and, assuming that he was simply dreaming, goes back to sleep, not seeing a puddle of water and barnacles on the floor. Although the post-credits scene of &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; featured Will Turner having a dream of Davy Jones seemingly resurrected from the dead, directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg confirmed the scene was meant to &quot;pay respect to a legendary villain in the franchise&quot; as well as be a tease or hint that it could be the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; or &quot;just a dream or nightmare&quot;.

==Games/video games==
Will Turner appears in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; world, Port Royal/The Caribbean, of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;. In the Japanese version of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; as well as in the movies he&#x27;s voiced by Daisuke Hirakawa, who was also the Japanese voice for Legolas, another famous character portrayed by Bloom. Crispin Freeman provided the voice of Will for the U.S. version of the game since Orlando Bloom was unavailable due to the filming of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; and &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;. Freeman was also the voice of Will in the video game &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow&quot; and in the video game adaptation of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;.

Will Turner appears in the video game &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; and in &quot;Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game&quot; as a playable character in both games and was again voiced by Crispin Freeman. He also appears in the game &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean Online&quot; game as the character who gives the player their first sword. In the earlier versions of the game, Will urges the player to run and locate Tia Dalma after soldiers can be heard banging on his door. Will stays behind to confront them, drawing his sword. In the newer version, undead skeletons appear inside instead.

Will Turner appears as a playable character in the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;.

==Character development and portrayal==

Described as the &quot;traditional Errol Flynn type&quot; of character compared to Johnny Depp&#x27;s Keith Richards-inspired portrayal of Jack Sparrow, Will Turner was originally written as a prison guard who freed Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth Swann in early drafts of &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. Actor Orlando Bloom, who took the role of Turner after playing Legolas in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, stated that he read the script after Geoffrey Rush, whom he was working with on &quot;Ned Kelly&quot;, suggested it to him. Tobey Maguire, Jude Law, Ewan McGregor, Ben Peyton, Christian Bale and Heath Ledger were also considered for the role, with Tom Hiddleston also auditioning for the role.

By the end of filming the &quot;Pirates&quot; trilogy in 2006 and the release of &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; in 2007, both Bloom and Keira Knightley repeatedly stated that they were done with &quot;Pirates&quot; series, noting that there was closure for Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann in &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, and was quoted in saying they wanted to move on from the franchise, and so did not return for the fourth film &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;. However, Bloom made statements about returning to the &quot;Pirates&quot; franchise as early as October 2011. In 2012, Moviehole.Net reported that a &quot;separate Disney contact&quot; gave this one-line response: &quot;Will Turner&#x27;s story might not be finished...&quot; While there were discussions for him to reprise his role as Will Turner by 2014, his involvement in fifth film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; was announced in Disney D23. Bloom alluded to his character&#x27;s new &quot;gnarly&quot; appearance after taking over Davy Jones&#x27; post in &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, stating that it would be &quot;fun to do something where I’m rumbling round the bottom of the ocean, because I won’t look anything like me.&quot; Although it was announced as a supporting role, Bloom ultimately appeared as a cameo in &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, which was released in May 2017.

<text>Reload is the 34th album by Tom Jones, released in 1999. It contains 15 duets with a range of artists including Van Morrison, Cerys Matthews, Stereophonics, Robbie Williams, and Portishead, recorded with their usual record producers and in their usual studios. The tracks are mainly cover versions, with a new version of one of Jones&#x27; own songs, &quot;Looking Out My Window&quot; (1968), and one original track, &quot;Sex Bomb&quot;.

&quot;Reload&quot; became the highest seller of Jones&#x27;s career, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart in 1999 and again in 2000. Its biggest single was the collaboration with Mousse T, &quot;Sex Bomb&quot;, which reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart and was later used in a 2003 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (a show Jones had guest starred on in 1992). The album has sold more than four million copies worldwide. The album was not released in the US; instead the compilation &quot;Reloaded: Greatest Hits&quot; was issued there in 2003 and featured highlights from &quot;Reload&quot;.

<doc id="616927" wikidata="Q5327216" url="?curid=616927" title="Earthfall (novel)">
<text>Earthfall (1995) is a science fiction novel by American writer Orson Scott Card. It is the fourth book of the Homecoming Saga, a fictionalization of the first few hundred years recorded in the Book of Mormon.

==Plot summary==
The children of Wetchik are ready to board the starship &quot;Basilica&quot; and embark on their journey from the planet Harmony back to the origin of humanity: Earth. However, the rivalry between Nafai and Elemak promises the journey will be anything but peaceful. Each faction already has hidden plans to prematurely awaken from the long hibernation, to have the upper hand when the landing occurs. The children become pawns in their parents&#x27; power struggle - valuable potential adults that can strengthen each faction. But the Oversoul is ultimately in control, having uploaded a copy of itself into &quot;Basilica&#x27;s&quot; central computer, so that it can monitor the ship at all times.

After landing on Earth, the fragile peace wrought on board is merely a mask for the turmoils of passions that boil beneath. Not only do the colonists have to deal with the split, there are also the mysteriously symbiotic alien races that have evolved on Earth since humanity&#x27;s departure. The quest to understand the Angels (giant bats) and the Diggers (giant rats) that were foreshadowed in the dreams is not an easy one.

The focus throughout the course of this novel begins to drift away from the original generation of characters in order to delineate the passage of time. The factions that developed among the original generation have now spread to their children, through no fault of the children themselves. Nafai finds himself and his &quot;Nafari&quot; living and working primarily amongst the angel people, whereas the &quot;Elemaki&quot; associate much more closely with the diggers. It is this dissociation that eventually breaks nearly all the bonds—literally, for Hushidh and Cheveya—between Nafai and his older brother, Elemak. As Elemak&#x27;s rage and hatred for Nafai grow, he ingrains such feelings into his family and the digger people, laying the foundation for war.

After the death of Volemak the Nafari migrate northwards away from the landing site to found a new nation.

== Reception ==
A 1994 Kirkus review wrote, &quot;Card&#x27;s series would be more reader-friendly with fewer characters, and if the individual entries were more self-contained. Nevertheless, it continues to impress.&quot;

=== Prefixes ===

Prefixes can be used to distinguish nearby settlements with an otherwise same name. They can be attached or stand alone. Both settlements that are to be distinguished can have opposing prefixes (e.g. &quot;Niederschönhausen&quot; and &quot;Hohenschönhausen&quot;), but it is also common to attach the prefix only to one of them (e.g. &quot;Stettin&quot; and &quot;Neustettin&quot;).

*&quot;Alt-&quot;, &quot;Alten-&quot; or Low German &quot;Olden-&quot; (&quot;old&quot;). Examples: Alt Eberstein, Altenberg, Oldenburg.
*&quot;Groß-&quot; or &quot;Großen-&quot; (&quot;greater&quot;). Examples: Groß Kiesow, Großenhain.
*&quot;Hoh-&quot;, &quot;Hohen-&quot;, &quot;Höch-&quot; or &quot;Hoch-&quot; (&quot;high(er)&quot;, &quot;upper&quot;). Examples: Hohenschönhausen, Hohkönigsburg, Höchstadt.
*&quot;Klein-&quot; or Low German &quot;Lütten-&quot; (&quot;little&quot;). Examples: Klein Kiesow.
*&quot;Neu-&quot;, &quot;Neuen-&quot; or Low German &quot;Nien-&quot; (&quot;new&quot;). Examples: Neuburg am Inn, Neuenkirchen, Nienburg.
*&quot;Nieder-&quot; (&quot;lower&quot;; cf. English &quot;nether&quot;). Examples: Niederschönhausen.
*&quot;Ober-&quot; (&quot;upper&quot;, &quot;higher&quot;), or &quot;Oberst-&quot; (&quot;uppermost&quot;, &quot;highest&quot;). Examples: Oberhausen, Oberwesel, Oberstdorf.
*&quot;Wendisch-&quot;, &quot;Windisch- (Slovene) &quot; (&quot;Wendish&quot;) . Examples: Wendisch Baggendorf, Windischgarsten. This sometimes refers (particularly in present and former Austrian territories) to the original language of the inhabitants. Other examples: Böhmisch Krummau (Česky Krumlov), Unter-Deutschau (Nemška Loka).
*&quot;Unter-&quot; (&quot;lower&quot;; literally &quot;under&quot;). Examples: Unterliederbach.

Prefixes can also have a descriptive character. Examples are &quot;Lichten-&quot; or &quot;Lichter-&quot; (&quot;open range&quot;, e.g. Lichtenhagen), &quot;Schön-&quot; or &quot;Schöne-&quot; (&quot;nice&quot;, e.g. Schönwalde), &quot;Grün-&quot; or &quot;Grüne-&quot; (&quot;green&quot;, e.g. Grunwald).

Prefixes can also be used to indicate an (earlier) possession of the site. Examples are &quot;Kirch-&quot; (&quot;ecclesial possession&quot;, e.g. Kirch Jesar), &quot;Bischofs-&quot; (&quot;a bishop&#x27;s possession&quot;, e.g. Bischofswerda), &quot;Grafen-&quot; (&quot;a count&#x27;s possession&quot;, e.g. Grafenwöhr), &quot;Königs-&quot; (&quot;the king&#x27;s&quot;, e.g. Königs Wusterhausen, Königsberg), &quot;Kron-&quot; (possession of the crown, e.g. Kronstadt, Rügenwalde (once belonging to the princes of Rügen).

The prefix &quot;Bad&quot; (&quot;bath&quot;) indicates the place is an officially acknowledged spa. See Bad Kissingen, Bad Pyrmont, etc. Some places, like Aachen, do not use it although they could.

Often the name of the village founder or of the first settler constitute the first part of the place name (e.g. Oettingen, the founder was Otto; Gerolfingen, the founder was Gerolf, Rappoltsweiler, the founder was Ratbald or Ratbert). Mostly in the former Ostsiedlung area, the locator&#x27;s name was sometimes included as the first part of the name (e.g. Hanshagen, the locator was Hans).

=== Attachments ===

Some settlements have the name of a river or the province attached to their name to distinguish it from an (even distant) one carrying the same name. The distinguishing word can be added in parentheses, or connected to the name with prepositions &quot;an der&quot;/&quot;am&quot; (&quot;at&quot;), &quot;ob der&quot; (&quot;upon&quot;), &quot;auf&quot; (&quot;on&quot;) or &quot;in&quot;/&quot;im&quot; (&quot;in&quot;), or separated by a slash. Examples are:
*Frankfurt am Main
*Frankfurt (Oder) (also written &quot;Frankfurt an der Oder&quot; or &quot;Frankfurt/Oder&quot;)
*Freiburg im Breisgau
*Rothenburg ob der Tauber
*Bergen auf Rügen
*Lauenburg in Pommern (former German name of the Polish town)
*Kochel am See (&quot;at the lake&quot;, without the specific name of the lake)
*Kirchheim unter Teck (&quot;under the castle Teck&quot;)
*Lahr/Schwarzwald, etc.

Often, attachments or prepositions are abbreviated in the official names, e.g. Berg b.Neumarkt i.d.OPf. (&quot;Berg bei Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz&quot;), or compare Landau in der Pfalz and Landau a.d.Isar, or Langenfeld (Rheinland) and Stolberg (Rhld.)

Sometimes, a descriptive word is attached to a new settlement, that was once budding of another one and except for the attached word has the same name.

*&quot;(...)-Siedlung&quot; (&quot;settlement&quot;)
*&quot;(...)-Hof&quot; (&quot;farm&quot;), sometimes carrying an additional Roman number (e.g. Sanz Hof IV)
*&quot;(...)-Ausbau&quot; (&quot;expansion&quot;)

=== Others ===

The old Germanic &quot;Gaue&quot; districts were established by Charlemagne; earlier derivations were &quot;Gowe&quot; and &quot;Gouwe.&quot; One can still find the old &quot;Gouwe&quot; (Gau) for example in Haspengouw (Dutch name of Hesbaye) or Gäu as in Allgäu.

== German names from modern times ==
They usually follow the established patterns.
* Wuppertal (&quot;Wupper dale/valley&quot;), Karl-Marx-Stadt (&quot;Karl Marx city&quot;, name for Chemnitz during the DDR era), Wilhelmshaven (&quot;William&#x27;s haven/harbor&quot;, referring to King William I of Prussia).

== German place names derived from other languages ==

* Celtic names, used in prehistoric times in the southern and western parts of the German language area. Examples: Mainz (from Latin &quot;Moguntiacum&quot;, derived from a Celtic name), Remagen (from Celtic &quot;Rigomagos&quot; (&quot;king&#x27;s field&quot;), Latinized as &quot;Rigomagus&quot;), Wien (Vienna) (from Celtic &quot;Windobona&quot; (&quot;fair bottom country&quot;) [Latinized as &quot;Vindobona&quot;] or Celtic &quot;Wedunia&quot; (&quot;forest brook&quot;) [Latinized as &quot;Vedunia&quot;]), Zürich (from the Celtic word &quot;turicon&quot;, derived from &quot;turus&quot;; the old name of the town in its Romanized form was &quot;Turicum.&quot;)
* Latin names:
** from classical times, when the southern and western parts of the German language area belonged to the Roman Empire. Examples: Koblenz (from &quot;Confluentes&quot; &quot;joining rivers&quot;), Köln (Cologne) (from &quot;Colonia&quot; &quot;colony&quot;), Aachen (from &quot;Aquae&quot; &quot;springs&quot;), Augsburg and Augst (from &quot;Augusta&quot; &quot;city of Augustus&quot; and the Germanic suffix &quot;-burg&quot;).
** from medieval times, when Latin was the language of church and administration. Examples: München (Munich) (from &quot;monachus&quot;, &quot;monk&quot;, ultimately from Greek μοναχός - &quot;monachos&quot;), Münster (from &quot;monasterium&quot;, &quot;monastery&quot;, ultimately from Greek μοναστήριον - &quot;monastērion&quot;), Neumünster, Fraumünster, Grossmünster. See also &quot;minster&quot;.
* Slavic names: Prior to the medieval Ostsiedlung, Slavic languages like Polabian, Sorbian, Pomeranian, and Slovenian were spoken in the eastern parts of the Holy Roman Empire. The German settlers and administration in many cases adopted existing Wendish placenames, for example Rostock (from Old Polabian &quot;rostok&quot;, &quot;river fork&quot;), Dresden (from Sorbian &quot;Drežďany&quot;), and Berlin (possibly from a Polabian word meaning &quot;Swamp&quot;). For the same reason, many German placenames ending in &quot;-anz&quot; (e.g. Ummanz), &quot;-gard&quot; (e.g. Burg Stargard), &quot;-gast&quot; (e.g. Wolgast), &quot;-itz&quot; (e.g. Lancken-Granitz), &quot;-ow&quot; (e.g. Gützkow), and &quot;-vitz&quot; or &quot;-witz&quot; (e.g. Malschwitz) have Slavic roots. Due to spelling and pronunciation changes over the centuries, the original Wendish term in most cases is not preserved. Also, some placenames combine a German with a Wendish term (e.g. Altentreptow). The German suffix &quot;-&quot; can be related to the Slavic &quot;-ow&quot; and &quot;-ov&quot; when derived from the Old German spelling (u= w =double u; e.g. Prenzlau was earlier spelled &quot;Prenzlow&quot;).
* Scandinavian names: The region of Southern Schleswig was part of Duchy of Schleswig on the Jutland peninsula, which belonged to the Crown of Denmark until Prussia and Austria declared war on Denmark in 1864, leading to dozens of placenames of Danish origin, except in North Frisia and the southernmost area. Typical Scandinavian endings include -by, -bøl, -trup, -lund, -ved, -toft (in German form: -by, -büll, -trup, -lund, -witt, -toft). In some cases the South Jutlandic form has been eradicated from the Standard Danish variety of the name, but is still visible in the Germanised version:

In many other cases the Germanised versions are out of etymological context. Examples include the Danish ending &quot;-næs&quot; (peninsula) being replaced by &quot;-nitz&quot;, an unrelated Slavic ending which is common in eastern Germany. Such arbitrary translations were often made by the central Prussian government after the whole of Slesvig was ceded to Prussia after the war of 1864.

The South Jutlandic name of the town of Schleswig (Slesvig), from which the region derives its name, was &quot;Sljasvig&quot; with the stress on the second syllable.

<text>Generic routing encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco Systems that can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links or point-to-multipoint links over an Internet Protocol network.

==Example uses==
* In conjunction with PPTP to create VPNs.
* In conjunction with IPsec VPNs to allow passing of routing information between connected networks.
* In mobility management protocols.
* In A8/A10 interfaces to encapsulate IP data to/from Packet Control Function (PCF).
* Linux and BSD can establish ad-hoc IP over GRE tunnels which are interoperable with Cisco equipment.
* Distributed denial of service (DDoS) protected appliance to an unprotected endpoint.

===Example protocol stack===
Based on the principles of protocol layering in OSI, protocol encapsulation, not specifically GRE, breaks the layering order. It may be viewed as a separator between two different protocol stacks, one acting as a carrier for another.

==Delivery protocols==
GRE packets that are encapsulated within IP directly, use IP protocol type 47 in the IPv4 header&#x27;s &quot;Protocol&quot; field or the IPv6 header&#x27;s &quot;Next Header&quot; field.

For performance reasons, GRE can also be encapsulated in UDP packets. Better throughput may be achieved by using Equal-cost multi-path routing.

==Packet header==
===Extended GRE packet header (RFC 2890)===
The extended version of the GRE packet header is represented below:

; &quot;C (1 bit)&quot;: Checksum bit. Set to 1 if a checksum is present.
; &quot;K (1 bit)&quot;: Key bit. Set to 1 if a key is present.
; &quot;S (1 bit)&quot;: Sequence number bit. Set to 1 if a sequence number is present.
; &quot;Reserved 0 (9 bits)&quot;: Reserved bits; set to 0.
; &quot;Version (3 bits)&quot;: GRE Version number; set to 0.
; &quot;Protocol Type (16 bits)&quot;: Indicates the ether protocol type of the encapsulated payload. (For IPv4, this would be hex 0800.)
; &quot;Checksum (16 bits)&quot;: Present if the &quot;C&quot; bit is set; contains the checksum for the GRE header and payload.
; &quot;Reserved 1 (16 bits)&quot;: Present if the &quot;C&quot; bit is set; is set to 0.
; &quot;Key (32 bits)&quot;: Present if the &quot;K&quot; bit is set; contains an application-specific key value.
; &quot;Sequence Number (32 bits)&quot;: Present if the &quot;S&quot; bit is set; contains a sequence number for the GRE packet.

===Standard GRE packet header (RFC 2784)===
A standard GRE packet header structure is represented in the diagram below.
; &quot;C (1 bit)&quot;: Checksum bit. Set to 1 if a checksum is present.
; &quot;Reserved 0 (12 bits)&quot;: Reserved bits; set to 0.
; &quot;Version (3 bits)&quot;: GRE Version number; set to 0.
; &quot;Protocol Type (16 bits)&quot;: Indicates the ether protocol type of the encapsulated payload. (For IPv4, this would be hexadecimal 0x0800; for IPv6, it would be 0x86DD.)
; &quot;Checksum (16 bits)&quot;: Present if the &quot;C&quot; bit is set; contains the checksum for the GRE header and payload.
; &quot;Reserved 1 (16 bits)&quot;: Present if the &quot;C&quot; bit is set; its contents is set to 0.

===Original GRE packet header (RFC 1701)===
The newer structure superseded the original structure:
The original GRE RFC defined further fields in the packet header which became obsolete in the current standard:
; &quot;C (1 bit)&quot;: Checksum bit. Set to 1 if a checksum is present.
; &quot;R (1 bit)&quot;: Routing Bit. Set to 1 if Routing and Offset information are present.
; &quot;K (1 bit)&quot;: Key bit. Set to 1 if a key is present.
; &quot;S (1 bit)&quot;: Sequence number bit. Set to 1 if a sequence number is present.
; &quot;s (1 bit)&quot;: Strict source route bit.
; &quot;Recur (3 bits)&quot;: Recursion control bits.
; &quot;Flags (5 bits)&quot;: Reserved for future use, set to 0.
; &quot;Version (3 bits)&quot;: Set to 0.
; &quot;Protocol Type (16 bits)&quot;: Indicates the ether protocol type of the encapsulated payload.
; &quot;Checksum (16 bits)&quot;: Present if the &quot;C&quot; bit is set; contains the checksum for the GRE header and payload.
; &quot;Offset (16 bits)&quot;: Present if &quot;R&quot; bit or &quot;C&quot; bit is set; contains valid information, only if &quot;R&quot; bit is set. An offset field indicating the offset within the &quot;Routing&quot; field to the active source route entry.
; &quot;Key (32 bits)&quot;: Present if the &quot;K&quot; bit is set; contains an application-specific key value.
; &quot;Sequence Number (32 bits)&quot;: Present if the &quot;S&quot; bit is set; contains a sequence number for the GRE packet.
; &quot;Routing (variable)&quot;: Present if &quot;R&quot; bit is set; contains a list of source route entries, therefore is of variable length.

===PPTP GRE packet header===

The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) uses a variant GRE packet header structure, represented below. PPTP creates a GRE tunnel through which the PPTP GRE packets are sent.
; &quot;C (1 bit)&quot;: Checksum bit. For PPTP GRE packets, this is set to 0.
; &quot;R (1 bit)&quot;: Routing bit. For PPTP GRE packets, this is set to 0.
; &quot;K (1 bit)&quot;: Key bit. For PPTP GRE packets, this is set to 1. (All PPTP GRE packets carry a key.)
; &quot;S (1 bit)&quot;: Sequence number bit. Set to 1 if a sequence number is supplied, indicating a PPTP GRE data packet.
; &quot;s (1 bit)&quot;: Strict source route bit. For PPTP GRE packets, this is set to 0.
; &quot;Recur (3 bits)&quot;: Recursion control bits. For PPTP GRE packets, these are set to 0.
; &quot;A (1 bit)&quot;: Acknowledgment number present. Set to 1 if an acknowledgment number is supplied, indicating a PPTP GRE acknowledgment packet.
; &quot;Flags (4 bits)&quot;: Flag bits. For PPTP GRE packets, these are set to 0.
; &quot;Version (3 bits)&quot;: GRE Version number. For PPTP GRE packets, this is set to 1.
; &quot;Protocol Type (16 bits)&quot;: For PPTP GRE packets, this is set to hex 880B.
; &quot;Key Payload Length (16 bits)&quot;: Contains the size of the payload, not including the GRE header.
; &quot;Key Call ID (16 bits)&quot;: Contains the Peer&#x27;s Call ID for the session to which the packet belongs.
; &quot;Sequence Number (32 bits)&quot;: Present if the S bit is set; contains the GRE payload sequence number.
; &quot;Acknowledgement Number (32 bits)&quot;: Present if the A bit is set; contains the sequence number of the highest GRE payload packet received by the sender.

<text>In molecular biology, the five-prime cap (5′ cap) is a specially altered nucleotide on the 5′ end of some primary transcripts such as precursor messenger RNA. This process, known as mRNA capping, is highly regulated and vital in the creation of stable and mature messenger RNA able to undergo translation during protein synthesis. Mitochondrial mRNA and chloroplastic mRNA are not capped.

== Structure ==

In eukaryotes, the 5′ cap (cap-0), found on the 5′ end of an mRNA molecule, consists of a guanine nucleotide connected to mRNA via an unusual 5′ to 5′ triphosphate linkage. This guanosine is methylated on the 7 position directly after capping &quot;in vivo&quot; by a methyltransferase. It is referred to as a 7-methylguanylate cap, abbreviated m7G. The Cap-0 is the base cap structure, however, the first and second transcribed nucleotides can also be 2&#x27; O-methylated, leading to the Cap-1 and Cap-2 structures, respectively. This is more common in higher eukaryotes and thought to be part of the innate immune system to recognize mRNAs from other organisms.

In multicellular eukaryotes and some viruses, further modifications can be made, including the methylation of the 2′ hydroxy-groups of the first 2 ribose sugars of the 5′ end of the mRNA. cap-1 has a methylated 2′-hydroxy group on the first ribose sugar, while cap-2 has methylated 2′-hydroxy groups on the first two ribose sugars, shown on the right. The 5′ cap is chemically similar to the 3′ end of an RNA molecule (the 5′ carbon of the cap ribose is bonded, and the 3′ unbonded). This provides significant resistance to 5′ exonucleases.

Small nuclear RNAs contain unique 5′-caps. Sm-class snRNAs are found with 5′-trimethylguanosine caps, while Lsm-class snRNAs are found with 5′-monomethylphosphate caps.

In bacteria, and potentially also in higher organisms, some RNAs are capped with NAD+, NADH, or 3′-dephospho-coenzyme A.

In all organisms, mRNA molecules can be decapped in a process known as messenger RNA decapping. This is usually followed by degradation of the mRNA.

== Capping process ==
The starting point for capping with 7-methylguanylate is the unaltered 5′ end of an RNA molecule, which terminates at a triphosphate group. This features a final nucleotide followed by three phosphate groups attached to the 5′ carbon. The capping process is initiated before the completion of transcription, as the nascent pre-mRNA is being synthesized.

# One of the terminal phosphate groups is removed by RNA triphosphatase, leaving a bisphosphate group (i.e. 5′(ppN)[pN]n);
# GTP is added to the terminal bisphosphate by mRNA guanylyltransferase, losing a pyrophosphate from the GTP substrate in the process. This results in the 5′–5′ triphosphate linkage, producing 5′(Gp)(ppN)[pN]n;
# The 7-nitrogen of guanine is methylated by mRNA (guanine-&quot;N&quot;7-)-methyltransferase, with &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl--methionine being demethylated to produce &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl--homocysteine, resulting in 5′(m7Gp)(ppN)[pN]n (cap-0);
# Cap-adjacent modifications can occur, normally to the first and second nucleotides, producing up to 5′(m7Gp)(ppN*)(pN*)[pN]n (cap-1 and cap-2);
# If the nearest cap-adjacent nucleotide is 2′-&quot;O&quot;-ribose methyl-adenosine (i.e. 5′(m7Gp)(ppAm)[pN]n), it can be further methylated at the N6 methyl position to form &quot;N&quot;6-methyladenosine, resulting in 5′(m7Gp)(ppm6Am)[pN]n.

The mechanism of capping with NAD+, NADH, or 3′-dephospho-coenzyme A is different. Capping with NAD+, NADH, or 3′-dephospho-coenzyme A is accomplished through an &quot;ab initio capping mechanism,&quot; in which NAD+, NADH, or 3′-desphospho-coenzyme A serves as a &quot;non-canonical initiating nucleotide&quot; (NCIN) for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase and thereby directly is incorporated into the RNA product. Both bacterial RNA polymerase and eukaryotic RNA polymerase II are able to carry out this &quot;ab initio capping mechanism&quot;.

== Targeting ==
For capping with 7-methylguanylate, the capping enzyme complex (CEC) binds to RNA polymerase II before transcription starts. As soon as the 5′ end of the new transcript emerges from RNA polymerase II, the CEC carries out the capping process (this kind of mechanism ensures capping, as with polyadenylation). The enzymes for capping can only bind to RNA polymerase II, ensuring specificity to only these transcripts, which are almost entirely mRNA.

Capping with NAD+, NADH, or 3′-dephospho-coenzyme A is targeted by promoter sequence. Capping with NAD+, NADH, or 3′-dephospho-coenzyme A occurs only at promoters that have certain sequences at and immediately upstream of the transcription start site and therefore occurs only for RNAs synthesized from certain promoters.

== Function ==
The 5′ cap has four main functions:
# Regulation of nuclear export;
# Prevention of degradation by exonucleases;
# Promotion of translation (see ribosome and translation);
# Promotion of 5′ proximal intron excision.

Nuclear export of RNA is regulated by the cap binding complex (CBC), which binds exclusively to 7-methylguanylate-capped RNA. The CBC is then recognized by the nuclear pore complex and exported. Once in the cytoplasm after the pioneer round of translation, the CBC is replaced by the translation factors eIF4E and eIF4G of the eIF4F complex. This complex is then recognized by other translation initiation machinery including the ribosome.

Capping with 7-methylguanylate prevents 5′ degradation in two ways. First, degradation of the mRNA by 5′ exonucleases is prevented (as mentioned above) by functionally looking like a 3′ end. Second, the CBC and eIF4E/eIF4G block the access of decapping enzymes to the cap. This increases the half-life of the mRNA, essential in eukaryotes as the export and translation processes take significant time.

Decapping of a 7-methylguanylate-capped mRNA is catalyzed by the decapping complex made up of at least Dcp1 and Dcp2, which must compete with eIF4E to bind the cap. Thus the 7-methylguanylate cap is a marker of an actively translating mRNA and is used by cells to regulate mRNA half-lives in response to new stimuli. Undesirable mRNAs are sent to P-bodies for temporary storage or decapping, the details of which are still being resolved.

The mechanism of 5′ proximal intron excision promotion is not well understood, but the 7-methylguanylate cap appears to loop around and interact with the spliceosome in the splicing process, promoting intron excision.

<text>Harry Babbitt (November 2, 1913 – April 9, 2004) was an American singer and star during the Big Band era.

==Early career==
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Babbitt organized his own band after high school, directing the group in addition to singing and playing saxophone and drums. Later, his work as an announcer and soloist on a radio station in St. Louis caught the attention of bandleader Kay Kyser.

==Music career==
Babbitt joined the Kyser band in the winter of 1936. With Kyser he recorded several hits in his rich baritone. On some novelty tunes he adopted a high-pitched falsetto. Babbitt sang such hits as &quot;Three Little Fishies,&quot; &quot;(I&#x27;d Like to Get You on a) Slow Boat to China&quot; and &quot;Jingle, Jangle, Jingle,&quot; but his biggest hit was the cover of Vera Lynn&#x27;s &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot;. He also sang the Spike Jones holiday hit, &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth&quot; and did the laugh on Kyser&#x27;s &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; song with vocalist Gloria Wood. He appeared as a regular on Kyser&#x27;s radio program, &quot;Kay Kyser&#x27;s Kollege of Musical Knowledge&quot;, and in seven movies with Kyser, including &quot;That&#x27;s Right – You&#x27;re Wrong&quot; (1939), &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot; (1943) and &quot;Carolina Blues&quot; (1944).

Babbitt served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946, then returned to Kyser&#x27;s band, which he eventually left for good in 1949.

==Radio and television==
Babbitt was host of an early morning radio show, &quot;The Second Cup of Coffee Club&quot; on CBS. It ran 10 years in the 1940s and 1950s. He also co-starred with Mary Small on &quot;By Popular Demand&quot;, a weekly program on Mutual in 1945–1946.

Babbitt&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Variety&quot; called him &quot;a television pioneer,&quot; noting that &quot;he hosted two long-running musical shows on KTLA-TV in Los Angeles: &quot;Bandstand Review&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Opportunity&quot;. He also hosted an NBC program, &quot;Glamour Girl&quot;, which ran in 1953–1954 and provided &quot;wardrobe advice, beauty treatments and other tips ... designed to make the average woman a glamour girl.&quot;

==Later years==
Babbitt retired from showbusiness in 1964 and made money in real estate in Orange County, California. He also managed the Newport Tennis Club and headed public relations for a retirement community, both in Orange County.

After Kyser died, Babbitt went on tour with a new band, using Kyser&#x27;s name and music. He retired from that in the mid-1990s.

==Death==
Babbitt died at the age of 90 in Aliso Viejo, California. He and his wife, Betty, were married 69 years. He was survived by her, their sons Michael, Stephen and Christopher, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

<doc id="616948" wikidata="Q63344993" url="?curid=616948" title="Tea leaf grading">
<text>In the tea industry, tea leaf grading is the process of evaluating products based on the quality and condition of the tea leaves themselves.

The highest grades for Western and South Asian teas are referred to as &quot;orange pekoe&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;OP&quot;), and the lowest as &quot;fannings&quot; or &quot;dust&quot;. Pekoe tea grades are classified into various qualities, each determined by how many of the adjacent young leaves (two, one, or none) were picked along with the leaf buds. Top-quality pekoe grades consist of only the leaf buds, which are picked using the balls of the fingertips. Fingernails and mechanical tools are not used, to avoid bruising. Certain grades of leaf are better suited to certain varieties of tea. For example, most white tea is processed from the buds or shoots of the tea plant.

When crushed to make bagged teas, the tea is referred to as &quot;broken&quot;, as in &quot;broken orange pekoe&quot; (&quot;BOP&quot;). These lower grades include fannings and dust, which are tiny remnants created in the sorting and crushing processes.

The &quot;OP&quot; grade is also subdivided to include categories higher than OP, which are determined primarily by leaf wholeness and size; &quot;TGFOP1&quot; (Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe, First Grade) is an example of a higher grade of OP.

Broken, fannings and dust orthodox teas (&quot;orthodox tea&quot; meaning the leaves are processed only by traditional methods) have slightly different grades. CTC teas, which consist of leaves rendered to uniform fannings by machine, have yet another grading system.

==General classifications==
=== Grading by size ===
Although grading systems vary, the size of the leaf or broken pieces is an essential quality. Size is an important factor how tea is prepared as a beverage. In general, larger leaves or pieces require a longer steeping time. Also, if measured by volume, the larger sizes need more tea to produce the same strength beverage.

=== Grading by appearance ===
Some teas are graded by their appearance. Whole leaves are easier to grade by appearance than broken pieces.

=== Orange pekoe ===

Orange pekoe (), also spelled pecco, or OP is a term used in the Western tea trade to describe a particular genre of black teas (orange pekoe grading). Despite a purported Chinese origin, these grading terms are typically used for teas from Sri Lanka, India and countries other than China; they are not generally known within Chinese-speaking countries. The grading system is based upon the size of processed and dried black tea leaves.

The tea industry uses the term orange pekoe to describe a basic, medium-grade black tea consisting of many whole tea leaves of a specific size; however, it is popular in some regions (such as North America) to use the term as a description of any generic black tea (though it is often described to the consumer as a specific variety of black tea). Within this system, the teas that receive the highest grades are obtained from new flushes (pickings). This includes the terminal leaf bud along with a few of the youngest leaves. Grading is based on the &quot;size&quot; of the individual leaves and flushes, which is determined by their ability to fall through the screens of special meshes ranging from 8–30 mesh. This also determines the &quot;wholeness&quot;, or level of breakage, of each leaf, which is also part of the grading system. Although these are not the only factors used to determine quality, the size and wholeness of the leaves will have the greatest influence on the taste, clarity, and brewing time of the tea.

When used outside the context of black-tea grading, the term &quot;pekoe&quot; (or, occasionally, orange pekoe) describes the unopened terminal leaf bud (tips) in tea flushes. As such, the phrases &quot;a bud and a leaf&quot; or &quot;a bud and two leaves&quot; are used to describe the &quot;leafiness&quot; of a flush; they are also used interchangeably with pekoe and a leaf or pekoe and two leaves.

====Etymology====

The origin of the word &quot;pekoe&quot; is uncertain. One explanation is that it is derived from the transliterated mispronunciation of the Amoy (Xiamen) dialect word for a Chinese tea known as &quot;white down/hair&quot; (白毫; ). This is how &quot;pekoe&quot; is listed by Rev. Robert Morrison (1782–1834) in his Chinese dictionary (1819) as one of the seven sorts of black tea &quot;commonly known by Europeans&quot;. This refers to the down-like white &quot;hairs&quot; on the leaf and also to the youngest leaf buds. Another hypothesis is that the term derives from the Chinese &quot;báihuā&quot; &quot;white flower&quot; (), and refers to the bud content of pekoe tea.

Sir Thomas Lipton, the 19th-century British tea magnate, is widely credited with popularizing, if not inventing, the term &quot;orange pekoe&quot;, which seems to have no Chinese precedent, for Western markets. The &quot;orange&quot; in orange pekoe is sometimes mistaken to mean the tea has been flavoured with orange, orange oils, or is otherwise associated with oranges. However, the orange fruit is unrelated to the tea&#x27;s flavor. There are two explanations for its meaning, though neither is definitive:

# The Dutch House of Orange-Nassau, now the royal family, was already the most respected aristocratic family in the days of the Dutch Republic and came to control the &quot;de facto&quot; head of state position (Stadtholder) of Holland and Zealand. The Dutch East India Company played a central role in bringing tea to Europe and may have marketed the tea as &quot;orange&quot; to suggest association with the House of Orange.
# Colour: the copper colour of a high-quality, oxidized leaf before drying, or the final bright orange colour of the dried pekoes in the finished tea may be related to the name. These usually consist of one leaf bud and two leaves covered in fine, downy hair. The orange colour appears when the tea is fully oxidized.

===Fannings===
Fannings are small pieces of tea that are left over after higher grades of teas are gathered to be sold. Traditionally these were treated as the rejects of the manufacturing process in making high-quality leaf tea like the orange pekoe. Fannings with extremely small particles are graded &quot;Dust&quot; (See &quot;Dust grades&quot; below). Fannings and dusts are considered the lowest grades of tea, separated from broken-leaf teas which have larger pieces of the leaves. However, the fannings of expensive teas can still be more expensive and more flavourful than whole leaves of cheaper teas.

This traditionally low-quality tea has, however, experienced a huge demand in the developing world in the last century as the practice of tea drinking became popular. Tea stalls in India and the South Asian sub-continent and Africa prefer dust tea because it is cheap and also produces a very strong brew; consequently, more cups are obtained per measure of tea dust.

Because of the small size of the particles, a tea infuser is typically used to brew fannings. Fannings are also typically used in most tea bags, although some companies sell tea bags containing whole-leaf tea.

Some exporters focus primarily on broken-leaf teas, fannings, and dusts.

==Grades==
Choppy contains many leaves of various sizes. Fannings are small particles of tea leaves used almost exclusively in tea bags. Flowery consists of large leaves, typically plucked in the second or third flush with an abundance of tips. Golden flowery includes very young tips or buds (usually golden in colour) that were picked early in the season. Tippy includes an abundance of tips.

<text>In electromagnetism, electrostatic deflection refers to a way of modifying the path of a beam of charged particles by the use of an electric field applied transverse to the path of the particles. The technique is called electro&quot;static&quot; because the strength and direction of the applied field changes slowly relative to the time it takes for the particles to transit the field, and thus can be considered not to change (be static) for any single particle.

==Explanation==
The Lorentz force acts on any charged particle in an electrostatic deflection. Electrostatic deflection uses a special, simplified case of this general effect by limiting the field to an electric field. An electric field applies a force on a particle that is proportional to the strength of the field and to the charge on the particle. The direction of the applied force is the same as the direction of the electric field for positive charges and opposite for negative charges. For electrostatic deflection, the applied electric field is arranged so that it lies in the plane perpendicular to the initial direction of the stream. The particles are accelerated by this force in proportion to the charge of the particles. The path the particles follow depends on their sideways acceleration and their velocity when they enter the deflecting field. Therefore, it is important for good control of the direction that the particles in the stream have a uniform charge-to-mass ratio and that they move at a uniform speed.

==Uses==
The most common use for this technique is controlling the path of a stream of electrons in a vacuum. One application is in small cathode-ray tubes for oscilloscopes. In these tubes the electric field is created by two sets of paired electrodes, mounted at right angles, that the electron stream flows between. This arrangement allows independent deflection of the beam in two dimensions (usually perceived as up/down (vertical) and right/left (horizontal)). The electrodes are commonly called &quot;deflection plates&quot;. Traditionally, the electrons pass through the vertical deflection plates first, yielding slightly higher sensitivity because of the longer travel time from the vertical deflection plates to the phosphor screen as compared to the horizontal deflection plates. In very high speed oscilloscopes, the deflection plates were often complex structures, combining a series of sub-plates with an electrical delay line. By matching the propagation speed of the electrical signal with the transit speed of the electrons, maximum bandwidth (frequency response) was achieved.

The technique works well whenever a sufficiently uniform stream can be created, as discussed above. Therefore, it has been used in controlling macroscopic particle streams, for instance in fluorescence-activated cell sorting, as well. Another application was in one type of inkjet printer.

Electrostatic deflection is very useful for small deflection angles but is well known to be inferior to magnetic deflection for deflecting a charged particle beam into large angles - say over 10 degrees. The reason is that deflection aberrations become large as the deflection angle increases. This reduces the ability to finely focus the beam. Also in electrostatic deflection it has long been the practice to inject the beam midway between the charged deflection plates so as to avoid the fringe fields as much as possible. However it was found by computation methods that deflection aberrations would be significantly reduced if the beam were injected offset toward the attracting plate. That way the beam tends to follow equipotentials and the deflection force is normal to the beam direction. Thus offset, all the electrons in the beam are deflected into the same angle. There is an induced astigmatism that is correctable. This deflection idea has been tested and verified. Deflection angles of 50 degrees are reportedly possible without measurable deflection aberration. Optimal injection offset is approximately 1/3 of the plate gap toward the deflecting plate. The useful beam diameter is also approximately 1/3 of the gap.

<text>A watering can (or watering pot or watering jug) is a portable container, usually with a handle and a funnel, used to water plants by hand. It has been in use since at least A.D. 79 and has since seen many improvements in design. Apart from watering plants, it has varied uses, as it is a fairly versatile tool.

The capacity of the container can be anywhere from 0.5 litres (for indoor household plants) to 10 litres (for general garden use). It is usually made of metal, ceramic or plastic. At the end of the spout, a &quot;rose&quot; (a device, like a cap, with small holes) can be placed to break up the stream of water into droplets, to avoid excessive water pressure on the soil or on delicate plants.
== History ==

The term &quot;watering can&quot; first appeared in 1692, in the diary of keen cottage gardener Lord Timothy George of Cornwall. Before then, it was known as a &quot;watering pot&quot;.

In 1886 the &quot;Haws&quot; watering can was patented by John Haws. The patent read &quot;This new invention forms a watering pot that is much easier to carry and tip, and at the same time being much cleaner, and more adapted for use than any other put before the public.&quot;

The shower head end is called a &quot;rose&quot;, &quot;rose head&quot;, &quot;rosette&quot;, or &quot;sprinkler head&quot;.

== Modern uses ==
Watering cans are used by gardeners for watering plants, by road workers to apply bitumen to asphalt, as ornaments, and regularly in symbolic art pieces.

== In popular culture ==
*Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir painted a work entitled &quot;A Girl with a Watering Can&quot;.
*John Cleese, in a 1963 Cambridge University Footlights Revue (&quot;Cambridge Circus&quot;) sketch, &quot;Judge Not&quot;, described a watering can as: &quot;a large, cylindrical, tin-plated vessel with a perforated pouring piece, much used by the lower classes for the purpose of artificially moistening the surface soil&quot;.

<text>Nguyễn Du (; 3 January 1766 – 16 September 1820), courtesy name Tố Như () and art name Thanh Hiên (), is a celebrated Vietnamese poet and musician. He is most known for writing the epic poem &quot;The Tale of Kiều&quot;.

==Biography==

===Youth===

Nguyễn Du was born in a great wealthy family in 1765 in Bích Câu, Đông Kinh. His father, Nguyễn Nghiễm, was born in Tiên Điền village, Nghi Xuân, Hà Tĩnh, Vietnam. He was the seventh child of Nguyễn Nghiễm, a former prime minister under the Lê dynasty. By the age of 10, Du lost his father, and he also lost his mother at age 13, so for most of his teen years he lived with his brother Nguyễn Khản or with his brother-in-law Đoàn Nguyễn Tuấn.

At the age of 19 (some sources say 17), Du passed the provincial examination and received the title of &quot;tú tài&quot; (Bachelor&#x27;s degree), which made him (very roughly) the equivalent of a high school graduate. However, in Nguyễn Du&#x27;s time this was a far more difficult credential to obtain both because few people were affluent enough to devote themselves to study and because of exacting standards applied.

Du&#x27;s mother was his father&#x27;s third wife, noted for her ability at singing and composing poetry. In fact, she made her living by singing, which at that time was considered a disreputable occupation. It is said that Du may have inherited a part of his talents from his mother. He loved listening to traditional songs; and there was a rumor that, when he was 18, he himself eloped with a singer.

===Adulthood===

After passing the provincial exam, he was appointed to the position of a military advisor in the Royal (Trịnh) army. After the Trịnh lords were defeated in 1786 by Nguyễn Huệ (the second youngest, most able and popular of the three Tây Sơn brothers), Nguyễn Du refused to serve in the Tây Sơn administration. He was arrested and held for some time before moving back to his native village in the north of the country.

When Nguyễn Ánh defeated the Tây Sơn and took control over all of Vietnam in 1802, Nguyễn Du agreed to serve in his administration (many mandarins from the north refused to do this as it was widely felt that a mandarin should only serve one dynasty). At first he was given his old post of military advisor but after a decade he was promoted to ambassador to China (1813). While in China, he discovered and translated the Ming dynasty era tale that would become the basis for the &quot;Tale of Kiều&quot;. He was later appointed to two more diplomatic missions to Peking, but before he could depart for the last one, he died of a long illness for which he refused treatment.

Du&#x27;s father had been a minister under the Lê dynasty, and his family had benefited greatly under their rule. For most of his life, Nguyễn Du was haunted by what he felt was his own betrayal of the rightful rulers of Vietnam, which occurred when he accepted a post under the Nguyễn dynasty.

==&quot;The Tale of Kiều&quot;==

&quot;The Tale of Kiều&quot; (Vietnamese &quot;Truyện Kiều&quot;) was based on an earlier Chinese prose narrative, &quot;Kim Vân Kiều&quot;. It was written under a pen name as the story was quite critical of the basic tenets of Confucian morality. It is a tragic tale of two lovers forced apart by the girl&#x27;s loyalty to her family honor. In Vietnam, the poem is so popular and beloved that some people know the whole epic by heart and can recite it without a mistake.

The work is famous for its humane meaning and was translated into 20 languages, such as English, French, Japanese, Korean...

<text>John Louis Emil Dreyer (13 February 1852 – 14 September 1926), also Johan Ludvig Emil Dreyer, was a Danish astronomer who spent most of his career working in Ireland. He spent the last decade of his life in Oxford, England.

==Life==

Dreyer was born in Copenhagen. His father, Lieutenant General John Christopher Dreyer, was the Danish Minister for War and the Navy. When he was 14 he became interested in astronomy and regularly visited Hans Schjellerup at the Copenhagen observatory. He was educated in Copenhagen, taking an MA in 1872. While the same university later awarded him a PhD, in 1874. But in 1874, at the age of 22, he went to Parsonstown, Ireland. There he worked as the assistant of Lord Rosse (the son and successor of the Lord Rosse who built the Leviathan of Parsonstown telescope).

During 1878 he moved to Dunsink, the site of the Trinity College Observatory of Dublin University to work for Robert Stawell Ball. In 1882 he relocated again, this time to Armagh Observatory, where he served as Director until his retirement in 1916. In 1885 he became a British citizen. In 1916 he and his wife Kate moved to Oxford where Dreyer worked on editing the works of Tycho Brahe.

He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1916 and served as the society&#x27;s president from 1923 until 1925. He died on 14 September 1926 in Oxford, where he is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery.

A crater on the far side of the Moon is named after him.

==Works==

Dreyer compiled the &quot;New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars&quot;, basing it on William Herschel&#x27;s Catalogue of Nebulae, as well as two supplementary &quot;Index Catalogues&quot;. The NGC and IC catalogue designations are still widely used.

Dreyer was also a historian of astronomy. In 1890 he published a biography of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, and in his later years he edited Tycho&#x27;s publications and unpublished correspondence. These were published in a 15-volume edition, &quot;Opera Omnia&quot;, the last volume of which was published after his death.

His book &quot;History of the Planetary Systems from Thales to Kepler&quot; (1905), is currently printed with the title &quot;A History of Astronomy from Thales to Kepler&quot;.

He co-edited the first official history of the Royal Astronomical Society along with Herbert Hall Turner, &quot;History of the Royal Astronomical Society 1820–1920 (1923, reprinted 1987)&quot;.

<text>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, with Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) being the principal types. Crohn&#x27;s disease affects the small intestine and large intestine, as well as the mouth, esophagus, stomach and the anus, whereas UC primarily affects the colon and the rectum.

==Signs and symptoms==

In spite of Crohn&#x27;s and UC being very different diseases, both may present with any of the following symptoms: abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, severe internal cramps/muscle spasms in the region of the pelvis and weight loss. Anemia is the most prevalent extraintestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Associated complaints or diseases include arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). Associations with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) have also been reported. Diagnosis is generally by assessment of inflammatory markers in stool followed by colonoscopy with biopsy of pathological lesions.
==Causes==

IBD is a complex disease which arises as a result of the interaction of environmental and genetic factors leading to immunological responses and inflammation in the intestine.

=== Diet ===

People living with IBD are very interested in diet, but little is known about the impact of diet on these patients. Recent reviews underlined the important role of nutritional counselling in IBD patients. Patients should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation.

A 2022 study found that diets with increased intake of fruits and vegetables, reduction of processed meats and refined carbohydrates, and preference of water for hydration were associated with lower risk of active symptoms with IBD, although increased intake of fruits and vegetables alone did not reduce risk of symptoms with Crohn&#x27;s disease. A 2022 scientific review also found generally positive outcomes for IBD patients who adhered to the Mediterranean diet (high fruit and vegetable intake).

Dietary patterns are associated with a risk for ulcerative colitis. In particular, subjects who were in the highest tertile of the healthy dietary pattern had a 79% lower risk of ulcerative colitis.

Gluten sensitivity is common in IBD and associated with having flareups. Gluten sensitivity was reported in 23.6% and 27.3% of Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively.

A diet high in protein, particularly animal protein, and/or high in sugar may be associated with increased risk of IBD and relapses.

===Bile acids===

Emerging evidence indicates that bile acids are important etiological agents in IBD pathogenesis. IBD patients have a consistent pattern of an increased abundance of primary bile acids such as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (and their conjugated forms), and a decreased abundance of secondary bile acids such as lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid.

===Microbiota===
The human microbiota consists of 10–100 trillion microorganisms. Several studies have confirmed that the microbiota composition is different in patients with IBD compared to healthy individuals. This difference is more pronounced in patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease than in those with ulcerative colitis. In IBD patients, there is a decrease or absence of beneficial bacteria such as &quot;Bifidobacterium longum&quot;, &quot;Eubacterium rectale&quot;, &quot;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&quot;, and &quot;Roseburia intestinalis&quot;, while harmful species like &quot;Bacteroides fragilis&quot;, &quot;Ruminococcus torques&quot;, and &quot;Ruminococcus&quot; are more abundant.
The activation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species leads to oxidative stress for both host cells and the gut microbiome. Consequently, in IBD, there is a microbial imbalance, known as dysbiosis, characterized by an increase in functional pathways involved in the microbial response to oxidative stress. This oxidative stress can promote the growth of certain species such as &quot;R. gnavus&quot;. Another opportunistic bacterium called &quot;A. muciniphila&quot; contributes to IBD development and is more prevalent in individuals lacking NOD-like receptor 6 (NLRP6). Both &quot;R. gnavus&quot; and &quot;A. muciniphila&quot; are bacterial species that are more abundant in IBD.
Patients with IBD often exhibit stronger antibody and T-cell responses to microbial antigens. The gut microbiome employs various approaches to interact with the host immune system. For instance, &quot;B. fragilis&quot;, which is symbiotic in humans, can transfer immune regulatory molecules to immune cells through the secretion of outer membrane vesicles. This mechanism plays a protective role in IBD by activating the non-classical autophagy pathway, dependent on Atg16L1 and NOD2 genes. &quot;B. thetaiotaomicron&quot; induces the differentiation of T regulatory cells (Tregs) to modulate gut immunity, thus increasing the expression of Gata3 and FoxP3 genes.
The colonization of &quot;Clostridium&quot; spp. can enhance the aggregation of RORγT+ FOXP3 Treg cells, which inhibit the development of Th2 and Th17 cells. Ultimately, this colonization could decrease the response of colonic Th2 and Th17 cells.
Also &quot;F. prausnitzii&quot; attracts CD4 and CD8a (DP8α) regulatory T cells.
&quot;E. coli&quot; Nissle 1917 has the capability to inhibit the growth of &quot;Salmonella&quot; and other harmful bacteria. It prevents these pathogens from adhering to and invading intestinal epithelial cells, which significantly reduces the likelihood of inflammation in the gut and may also prevent the onset of IBD.

===Breach of intestinal barrier===

Loss of integrity of the intestinal epithelium plays a key role in IBD. Dysfunction of the innate immune system as a result of abnormal signaling through immune receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs)—which activates an immune response to molecules that are broadly shared by multiple pathogens—contributes to acute and chronic inflammatory processes in IBD colitis and associated cancer. Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota are an important environmental factor in the development of IBD. Detrimental changes in the intestinal microbiota induce an inappropriate (uncontrolled) immune response that results in damage to the intestinal epithelium. Breaches in this critical barrier (the intestinal epithelium) allow further infiltration of microbiota that, in turn, elicit further immune responses. IBD is a multifactorial disease that is nonetheless driven in part by an exaggerated immune response to gut microbiota that causes defects in epithelial barrier function.

===Oxidative stress and DNA damage===

Oxidative stress and DNA damage likely have a role in the pathophysiology of IBD. Oxidative DNA damage as measured by 8-OHdG levels was found to be significantly increased in people with IBD compared to healthy controls, and in inflamed mucosa compared with noninflamed mucosa. Antioxidant capacity as measured by the total action of all antioxidants detected in blood plasma or body fluids was found to be significantly decreased in people with IBD compared to healthy controls, and in inflamed mucosa compared with noninflamed mucosa.

==Genetics==

A genetic component to IBD has been recognized for over a century. Research that has contributed to understanding of the genetics include studies of ethnic groups (e.g., Ashkenazi Jews, Irish), familial clustering, epidemiological studies, and twin studies. With the advent of molecular genetics, understanding of the genetic basis has expanded considerably, particularly in the past decade. The first gene linked to IBD was NOD2 in 2001.

Genome-wide association studies have since added to understanding of the genomics and pathogenesis of the disease. More than 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs or &quot;snips&quot;) are now known to be associated with susceptibility to IBD. One of the largest genetic studies of IBD was published in 2012. The analysis explained more of the variance in Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis than previously reported. The results suggested that commensal microbiota are altered in such a way that they act as pathogens in inflammatory bowel diseases. Other studies show that mutations in IBD-associated genes might interfere with the cellular activity and interactions with the microbiome that promote normal immune responses. Many studies identified that microRNAs dysregulation involved in IBD and to promote colorectal cancer. By 2020, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was launched by a small consortium using IBD patient biopsy material in a search for therapeutic targets.

According to an article published on Nature, ETS2 gene plays a vital role in the development of the disease.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is usually confirmed by biopsies on colonoscopy. Fecal calprotectin is useful as an initial investigation, which may suggest the possibility of IBD, as this test is sensitive but not specific for IBD.

===Classification===

Inflammatory bowel diseases are autoimmune diseases, in which the body&#x27;s own immune system attacks elements of the digestive system. The chief types of IBD are Crohn&#x27;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Several other conditions are variously referred to either as being inflammatory bowel diseases or as being similar to but distinct from inflammatory bowel diseases. These conditions include:
* Microscopic colitis with subtypes
** Collagenous colitis
** Lymphocytic colitis
* Diversion colitis
* Behçet&#x27;s disease

=== Differential diagnosis ===

Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis are both common differential diagnoses for the other, and confidently diagnosing a patient with one of the two diseases may sometimes not be possible. No disease specific markers are currently known in the blood that would enable the reliable separation of patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis. Physicians tell the difference between Crohn&#x27;s disease and UC by the &quot;location&quot; and &quot;nature&quot; of the inflammatory changes. Crohn&#x27;s can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from mouth to anus (&quot;skip lesions&quot;), although a majority of the cases start in the terminal ileum. Ulcerative colitis, in contrast, is restricted to the colon and the rectum. Microscopically, ulcerative colitis is restricted to the mucosa (epithelial lining of the gut), while Crohn&#x27;s disease affects the full thickness of the bowel wall (&quot;transmural lesions&quot;). Lastly, Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis present with extra-intestinal manifestations (such as liver problems, arthritis, skin manifestations and eye problems) in different proportions. In 10–15% of cases, a definitive diagnosis neither of Crohn&#x27;s disease nor of ulcerative colitis can be made because of idiosyncrasies in the presentation. In these cases, a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis may be made.

Irritable bowel syndrome can present with similar symptoms as either disease, as can nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) enteritis and intestinal tuberculosis. Conditions that can be mistaken particularly for Crohn&#x27;s disease include Behçet&#x27;s disease and coeliac disease, while conditions that can be symptomatically similar to ulcerative colitis in particular include acute self-limiting colitis, amebic colitis, schistosomiasis and colon cancer. Other diseases may cause an increased excretion of fecal calprotectin, such as infectious diarrhea, untreated celiac disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal cystic fibrosis and neoplastic pediatric tumor cells.

Liver function tests are often elevated in IBD, and are often mild and generally return spontaneously to normal levels. The most relevant mechanisms of elevated liver functions tests in IBD are drug-induced hepatotoxicity and fatty liver.

==Treatment==
===Surgery===
CD and UC are chronic inflammatory diseases, and are not medically curable. However, Ulcerative Colitis can in most cases be cured by proctocolectomy, although this may not eliminate extra-intestinal symptoms. An ileostomy will collect feces in a bag. Alternatively, a pouch can be created from the small intestine; this serves as the rectum and prevents the need for a permanent ileostomy. Between one-quarter and one-half of patients with ileo-anal pouches do have to manage occasional or chronic pouchitis.

Surgery cannot cure Crohn&#x27;s disease but may be needed to treat complications such as abscesses, strictures or fistulae. Severe cases may require surgery, such as bowel resection, strictureplasty or a temporary or permanent colostomy or ileostomy. In Crohn&#x27;s disease, surgery involves removing the worst inflamed segments of the intestine and connecting the healthy regions, but unfortunately, it does not cure Crohn&#x27;s or eliminate the disease. At some point after the first surgery, Crohn&#x27;s disease can recur in the healthy parts of the intestine, usually at the resection site. (For example, if a patient with Crohn&#x27;s disease has an ileocecal anastomosis, in which the caecum and terminal ileum are removed and the ileum is joined to the ascending colon, their Crohn&#x27;s will nearly always flare-up near the anastomosis or in the rest of the ascending colon).

===Medical therapies===
Medical treatment of IBD is individualised to each patient. The choice of which drugs to use and by which route to administer them (oral, rectal, injection, infusion) depends on factors including the type, distribution, and severity of the patient&#x27;s disease, as well as other historical and biochemical prognostic factors, and patient preferences. For example, mesalazine is more useful in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn&#x27;s disease. Generally, depending on the level of severity, IBD may require immunosuppression to control the symptoms, with drugs such as prednisone, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNF inhibitors), azathioprine, methotrexate, or 6-mercaptopurine.

Steroids, such as the glucocorticoid prednisone, are frequently used to control disease flares and were once acceptable as a maintenance drug. Biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease, especially the TNF inhibitors, are used in people with more severe or resistant Crohn&#x27;s disease and sometimes in ulcerative colitis.

Treatment is usually started by administering drugs with high anti-inflammatory effects, such as prednisone. Once the inflammation is successfully controlled, another drug to keep the disease in remission, such as mesalazine in UC, is the main treatment. If further treatment is required, a combination of an immunosuppressive drug (such as azathioprine) with mesalazine (which may also have an anti-inflammatory effect) may be needed, depending on the patient. Controlled release budesonide is used for mild ileal Crohn&#x27;s disease.

===Nutritional and dietetic therapies===
Exclusive enteral nutrition is a first-line therapy in pediatric Crohn&#x27;s disease with weaker data in adults. Evidence supporting exclusive enteral nutrition in ulcerative colitis is lacking.

Nutritional deficiencies play a prominent role in IBD. Malabsorption, diarrhea, and GI blood loss are common features of IBD. Deficiencies of B vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids, and key minerals such as magnesium, zinc, and selenium are extremely common and benefit from replacement therapy. Dietary interventions, including certain exclusion diets like the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) can be beneficial for symptom management. Dietary fiber interventions, such as psyillium supplementation (a mixture of soluble and insoluble fibers), may relieve symptoms as well as induce/maintain remission by altering the microbiome composition of the GI tract, thereby improving regulation of immune function, reducing inflammation, and helping to restore the intestinal mucosal lining. Low serum levels of alanine transaminase can be a marker of sarcopenia which is underdiagnosed in patients with IBD and associated with a higher disease activity.

Anemia is commonly present in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease. Due to raised levels of inflammatory cytokines which lead to the increased expression of hepcidin, parenteral iron is the preferred treatment option as it bypasses the gastrointestinal system, has lower incidence of adverse events and enables quicker treatment. Hepcidin itself is also an anti-inflammatory agent. In the murine model very low levels of iron restrict hepcidin synthesis, worsening the inflammation that is present. Enteral nutrition has been found to be efficient to improve hemoglobin level in patients with IBD, especially combined with erythropoietin.

Gastrointestinal bleeding, occurring especially during ulcerative colitis relapse, can contribute to anemia when chronic, and may be life-threatening when acute. To limit the possible risk of dietary intake disturbing hemostasis in acute gastrointestinal bleeding, temporary fasting is often considered necessary in hospital settings. The effectiveness of this approach is unknown; a Cochrane review in 2016 found no published clinical trials including children.

Low levels of vitamin D are associated with crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis and people with more severe cases of inflammatory bowel disease often have lower vitamin D levels. It is not clear if vitamin D deficiency causes inflammatory bowel disease or is a symptom of the disease. There is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation therapy may be associated with improvements in scores for clinical inflammatory bowel disease activity and biochemical markers. Vitamin D treatment may be associated with less inflammatory bowel disease reoccurrence of symptoms (relapse). It is not clear if this treatment improves the person&#x27;s quality of life or what the clinical response to vitamin D treatment. The ideal treatment regime and dose of vitamin D therapy has not been well enough studied.

===Microbiome===
There is preliminary evidence of an infectious contribution to IBD in some patients that may benefit from antibiotic therapy, such as with rifaximin. The evidence for a benefit of rifaximin is mostly limited to Crohn&#x27;s disease with less convincing evidence supporting use in ulcerative colitis.

The use of oral probiotic supplements to modify the composition and behaviour of the microbiome has been considered as a possible therapy for both induction and maintenance of remission in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis. A Cochrane review in 2020 did not find clear evidence of improved remission likelihood, nor lower adverse events, in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease, following probiotic treatment.

For ulcerative colitis, there is low-certainty evidence that probiotic supplements may increase the probability of clinical remission. People receiving probiotics were 73% more likely to experience disease remission and over 2x as likely to report improvement in symptoms compared to those receiving a placebo, with no clear difference in minor or serious adverse effects. Although there was no clear evidence of greater remission when probiotic supplements were compared with 5‐aminosalicylic acid treatment as a monotherapy, the likelihood of remission was 22% higher if probiotics were used in combination with 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy. Whereas in people who are already in remission, it is unclear whether probiotics help to prevent future relapse, either as a monotherapy or combination therapy.

Fecal microbiota transplant is a relatively new treatment option for IBD which has attracted attention since 2010. Some preliminary studies have suggested benefits similar to those in &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection but a review of use in IBD shows that FMT is safe, but of variable efficacy. Systematic reviews showed that 33% of ulcerative colitis, and 50% of Crohn&#x27;s disease patients reach clinical remission after fecal microbiota transplant.

===Alternative medicine===
Complementary and alternative medicine approaches have been used in inflammatory bowel disorders. Evidence from controlled studies of these therapies has been reviewed; risk of bias was quite heterogeneous. The best supportive evidence was found for herbal therapy, with &quot;Plantago ovata&quot; and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy, wormwood in CD, mind/body therapy and self-intervention in UC, and acupuncture in UC and CD.

===Novel approaches===
Stem cell therapy is undergoing research as a possible treatment for IBD. A review of studies suggests a promising role, although there are substantial challenges, including cost and characterization of effects, which limit the current use in clinical practice.

=== Psychological interventions ===

Patients with IBD have a higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders compared to the general population, women with IBD are more likely than men to develop affective disorders since up to 65% of them may have depression and anxiety disorder.
Currently, there is no evidence to recommend psychological treatment, such as psychotherapy, stress management and patient&#x27;s education, to all adults with IBD in general. These treatments had no effect on quality of life, emotional well-being and disease activity. The need for these approaches should be individually assessed and further researched to identify subgroups and determine type of therapy that may benefit individuals with IBD. In adolescents population such treatments may be beneficial on quality of life and depression, although only short-term effects have been found, which also imposes the need for further research.

A meta analysis of interventions to improve mood (including talking therapy, antidepressants, and exercise) in people with IBD found that they reduced inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin. Psychological therapies reduced inflammation more than antidepressants or exercise.

== Treatment standards ==
Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Australia, the peak body for IBD in Australia, where prevalence is one of the highest in the world, reviewed the quality of care for patients admitted to Australian hospitals. They found that only one hospital met accepted standards for multidisciplinary care, but that care was improved with the availability of even minimal specialised services.

==Prognosis==

While IBD can limit quality of life because of pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, it is rarely fatal on its own. Fatalities due to complications such as toxic megacolon, bowel perforation and surgical complications are also rare. Fatigue is a common symptom of IBD and can be a burden.

Around one-third of individuals with IBD experience persistent gastrointestinal symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the absence of objective evidence of disease activity. Despite enduring the side-effects of long-term therapies, this cohort has a quality of life that is not significantly different to that of individuals with uncontrolled, objectively active disease, and escalation of therapy to biological agents is typically ineffective in resolving their symptoms. The cause of these IBS-like symptoms is unclear, but it has been suggested that changes in the gut-brain axis, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and the gut flora may be partially responsible.

While patients of IBD do have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, this is usually caught much earlier than the general population in routine surveillance of the colon by colonoscopy, and therefore patients are much more likely to survive.

New evidence suggests that patients with IBD may have an elevated risk of endothelial dysfunction and coronary artery disease.

The goal of treatment is toward achieving remission, after which the patient is usually switched to a lighter drug with fewer potential side effects. Every so often, an acute resurgence of the original symptoms may appear; this is known as a &quot;flare-up&quot;. Depending on the circumstances, it may go away on its own or require medication. The time between flare-ups may be anywhere from weeks to years, and varies wildly between patients – a few have never experienced a flare-up.

Life with IBD can be challenging; however, many with the condition lead relatively normal lives. IBD carries a psychological burden due to stigmatization of being diagnosed, leading to high levels of anxiety, depression, and a general reduction in the quality of life. Although living with IBD can be difficult, there are numerous resources available to help families navigate the ins and out of IBD, such as the Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA).

==Epidemiology==
IBD resulted in a global total of 51,000 deaths in 2013 and 55,000 deaths in 1990. The increased incidence of IBD since World War II has been correlated to the increase in meat consumption worldwide, supporting the claim that animal protein intake is associated with IBD. However, there are many environmental risk factors that have been linked to the increased and decreased risk of IBD, such as smoking, air pollution and greenspace, urbanization and Westernization. Inflammatory bowel diseases are increasing in Europe. Incidence and prevalence of IBD has risen steadily for the last decades in Asia, which could be related changes in diet and other environmental factors.

Around 0.8% of people in the UK have IBD. Similarly, around 270,000 (0.7%) of people in Canada have IBD, with that number expected to rise to 400,000 (1%) by 2030.

==Research==
The following treatment strategies are not used routinely, but appear promising in some forms of IBD.

Initial reports suggest that helminthic therapy may not only prevent but even control IBD: a drink with roughly 2,500 ova of the &quot;Trichuris suis&quot; helminth taken twice monthly decreased symptoms markedly in many patients. It is even speculated that an effective &quot;immunization&quot; procedure could be developed—by ingesting the cocktail at an early age.

Prebiotics and probiotics are focusing increasing interest as treatments for IBD. Currently, there is evidence to support the use of certain probiotics in addition to standard treatments in people with ulcerative colitis but there is no sufficient data to recommend probiotics in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease. Both single strain and multi-strain probiotics have been researched for mild to moderate cases of ulcerative colitis. The most clinically researched multi-strain probiotic with over 70 human trials is the De Simone Formulation. Further research is required to identify specific probiotic strains or their combinations and prebiotic substances for therapies of intestinal inflammation.

Currently, the probiotic strain, frequency, dose and duration of the probiotic therapy are not established. In severely ill people with IBD there is a risk of the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs (bacterial translocation) and subsequent bacteremia, which can cause serious adverse health consequences. Live bacteria might not be essential because of beneficial effects of probiotics seems to be mediated by their DNA and by secreted soluble factors, and their therapeutic effects may be obtained by systemic administration rather than oral administration.

In 2005 &quot;New Scientist&quot; published a joint study by Bristol University and the University of Bath on the apparent healing power of cannabis on IBD. Reports that cannabis eased IBD symptoms indicated the possible existence of cannabinoid receptors in the intestinal lining, which respond to molecules in the plant-derived chemicals. CB1 cannabinoid receptors – which are known to be present in the brain – exist in the endothelial cells which line the gut, it is thought that they are involved in repairing the lining of the gut when damaged.

The team deliberately damaged the cells to cause inflammation of the gut lining and then added synthetically produced cannabinoids; the result was that gut started to heal: the broken cells were repaired and brought back closer together to mend the tears. It is believed that in a healthy gut, natural endogenous cannabinoids are released from endothelial cells when they are injured, which then bind to the CB1 receptors. The process appears to set off a wound-healing reaction, and when people use cannabis, the cannabinoids bind to these receptors in the same way.

Previous studies have shown that CB1 receptors located on the nerve cells in the gut respond to cannabinoids by slowing gut motility, therefore reducing the painful muscle contractions associated with diarrhea. CB2, another cannabinoid receptor predominantly expressed by immune cells, was detected in the gut of people with IBD at a higher concentration. These receptors, which also respond to chemicals in cannabis, appear to be associated with apoptosis – programmed cell death – and may have a role in suppressing the overactive immune system and reducing inflammation by mopping up excess cells.

Activation of the endocannabinoid system was found efficient in ameliorating colitis and increasing the survival rate of mice, and reducing remote organ changes induced by colitis, further suggest that modulation of this system is a potential therapeutic approach for IBDs and the associated remote organ lesions.

Alicaforsen is a first generation antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to bind specifically to the human ICAM-1 messenger RNA through Watson-Crick base pair interactions in order to subdue expression of ICAM-1. ICAM-1 propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes (white blood cells) into inflamed tissue. Increased expression of ICAM-1 has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of people with ulcerative colitis, pouchitis and Crohn&#x27;s, where ICAM-1 over production correlated with disease activity. This suggests that ICAM-1 is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of these diseases.

Cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonists are found to decrease the induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 surface expression in human brain tissues and primary human brain endothelial cells (BMVEC) exposed to various pro-inflammatory mediators.

In 2014, an alliance among the Broad Institute, Amgen and Massachusetts General Hospital formed with the intention to &quot;collect and analyze patient DNA samples to identify and further validate genetic targets.&quot;

In 2015, a meta-analysis on 938 IBD patients and 953 controls, IBD was significantly associated with having higher odds of vitamin D deficiency.

Gram-positive bacteria present in the lumen could be associated with extending the time of relapse for ulcerative colitis.

Bidirectional pathways between depression and IBD have been suggested and psychological processes have been demonstrated to influence self-perceived physical and psychological health over time. IBD-disease activity may impact quality of life and over time may significantly affect individual&#x27;s mental well-being, which may be related to the increased risk to develop anxiety and/or depression. On the other hand, psychological distress may also influence IBD activity.

Higher rates of anxiety and depression are observed among those with IBD compared to healthy individuals, which correlated with disease severity. Part of this phenotypic correlation is due to a shared genetic overlap between IBD and psychiatric comorbidities. Moreover, anxiety and depression rates increase during active disease compared with inactive phases.

Flu vaccines are recommended for people with IBD in the UK; however, research suggests that vaccine uptake is low. Researchers analysed data on 13,631 adults with IBD on immune-suppressing drugs during the 2018 – 2019 flu season. Only half of this population received a vaccine during this period and few (32%) were vaccinated before the flu circulated in the community. This could be due to the belief that flu vaccines cause IBD flares; however, the same study did not find a link between vaccination and IBD flares.

==In other species==
IBD also occurs in dogs and is thought to arise from a combination of host genetics, intestinal microenvironment, environmental components and the immune system. There is an ongoing discussion, however, that the term &quot;chronic enteropathy&quot; might be better to use than &quot;inflammatory bowel disease&quot; in dogs because it differs from IBD in humans in how the dogs respond to treatment. For example, many dogs respond to only dietary changes compared to humans with IBD, who often need immunosuppressive treatment. Some dogs may also need immunosuppressant or antibiotic treatment when dietary changes are not enough. After having excluded other diseases that can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in dogs, intestinal biopsies are often performed to investigate what kind of inflammation is occurring (lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic, or granulomatous). In dogs, low levels of cobalamin in the blood have been shown to be a risk factor for negative outcome.

<doc id="616975" wikidata="Q124410" url="?curid=616975" title="Asian black bear">
<text>The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus), also known as the Asiatic black bear, moon bear and white-chested bear, is a medium-sized bear species native to Asia that is largely adapted to an arboreal lifestyle. It lives in the Himalayas, southeastern Iran, Pakistan, the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, Mainland Southeast Asia, the Korean Peninsula, China, the Russian Far East, the islands of Honshū and Shikoku in Japan, and Taiwan. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and is threatened by deforestation and poaching for its body parts, which are used in traditional medicine.

== Taxonomy ==
=== Ancestral and sister taxa ===
Biologically and morphologically, Asian black bears represent the beginning of the arboreal specializations attained by sloth bears and sun bears. Asian black bears have karyotypes nearly identical to those of the five other ursine bears, and, as is typical in the genus, they have 74 chromosomes. From an evolutionary perspective, Asian black bears are the least changed of the Old World bears, with certain scientists arguing that it is likely that all other lineages of ursine bear stem from this species. Scientists have proposed that Asian black bears are either a surviving, albeit modified, form of &quot;Ursus etruscus&quot;, specifically the early, small variety of the Middle Villafranchian (Upper Pliocene to Lower Pleistocene) or a larger form of &quot;Ursus minimus&quot;, an extinct species that arose 4,000,000 years ago. With the exception of the age of the bones, it is often difficult to distinguish the remains of &quot;Ursus minimus&quot; with those of modern Asian black bears.

Asian black bears are close relatives to American black bears, with which they share a common European ancestor; the two species are thought to have diverged 3,000,000 years ago, though genetic evidence is inconclusive. Both the American and Asian black species are considered sister taxa and are more closely related to each other than to the other species of bear. The earliest known specimens of Asian black bears are known from the Early Pliocene of Moldova. The earliest American black bear fossils, which were located in Port Kennedy, Pennsylvania, greatly resemble the Asian black species. The first mtDNA study undertaken on Asian black bears suggested that the species arose after the American black bears, while a second study could not statistically resolve the branching order of sloth bears and the two black species, suggesting that these three species underwent a rapid radiation event. A third study suggested that American black bears and Asian black bears diverged as sister taxa after the sloth bear lineage and before the sun bear lineage. Further investigations on the entire mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence indicate that the divergence of continental Asian and Japanese black bear populations might have occurred when bears crossed the land bridge between the Korean peninsula and Japan 500,000 years ago, which is consistent with paleontological evidence.

=== Subspecies ===

Until the Late Pleistocene, two further subspecies ranged across Europe and West Asia. These are &quot;U. t. mediterraneus&quot; from Western Europe and the Caucasus and &quot;U. t. permjak&quot; from Eastern Europe, particularly the Ural Mountains.

=== Hybrids ===
Asian black bears are reproductively compatible with several other bear species, and have on occasion produced hybrid offspring. According to Jack Hanna&#x27;s &quot;Monkeys on the Interstate&quot;, a bear captured in Sanford, Florida, was thought to have been the offspring of an escaped female Asian black bear and a male American black bear, and Scherren&#x27;s &quot;Some notes on hybrid bears&quot; published in 1907 mentioned a successful mating between an Asian black bear and a sloth bear. In 1975, within Venezuela&#x27;s &quot;Las Delicias&quot; Zoo, a female Asian black bear shared its enclosure with a male spectacled bear, and produced several hybrid descendants. In 2005, a possible Asian black bear–sun bear hybrid cub was captured in the Mekong River watershed of eastern Cambodia. An Asian black bear/brown bear hybrid, taken from a bile farm, is housed at the Animals Asia Foundation&#x27;s China Moon Bear Rescue .

== Characteristics ==
The Asian black bear has black fur, a light brown muzzle, and a distinct whitish or creamy patch on the chest, which is sometimes V-shaped. Its ears are bell shaped, proportionately longer than those of other bears, and stick out sideways from the head. Its tail is short, around long.
Adults measure at the shoulder, and in length. Adult males weigh with an average weight of about . Adult females weigh , and large ones up to .

The Asian black bear is similar in general build to brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;), but is lighter and smaller. The lips and nose are larger and more mobile than those of brown bears. The skulls of the Asian black bear is relatively small, but massive, particularly in the lower jaw. Adult males have skulls measuring in length and in width, while female skulls are long and wide. Compared to other bears of the genus &quot;Ursus&quot;, the projections of the skull are weakly developed; the sagittal crest is low and short, even in old specimens, and does not exceed more than 19–20% of the total length of the skull, unlike in the brown bear, which has a sagittal crest comprising up to 41% of the skull&#x27;s length.

Although mostly herbivorous, the jaw structure of Asian black bears is not as specialized for plant eating as that of giant pandas: Asian black bears have much narrower zygomatic arches, and the weight ratio of the two pterygoid muscles is also much smaller in Asian black bears. The lateral slips of the temporal muscles are thicker and stronger in Asian black bears.

In contrast to the polar bear, the Asian black bear has a powerful upper body for climbing trees, and relatively weak hind legs which are shorter than those in the brown bear and American black bear. An Asian black bear with broken hind legs can still climb effectively. It is the most bipedal of all bears, and can walk upright for over . The heel pads on the forefeet are larger than those of most other bear species. Their claws, which are primarily used for climbing and digging, are slightly longer on the fore foot at than the back foot at , and are larger and more hooked than those of the American black bear. On average, adult Asian black bears are slightly smaller than American black bears, though large males can exceed the size of several other bear species.

The famed British sportsman known as the &quot;Old Shekarry&quot; wrote of how an Asian black bear he shot in India probably weighed no less than based on how many people it took to lift its body. The largest Asian black bear on record allegedly weighed . Zoo-kept specimens can weigh up to . Although their senses are more acute than those of brown bears, their eyesight is poor, and their hearing range is moderate, the upper limit being 30 kHz.

== Distribution and habitat ==
During the Middle Pleistocene and early Late Pleistocene, the Asian black bear ranged from the Iberian Peninsula, the Balkans to the Ural Mountains. Today, it occurs very patchily in its former range from southeastern Iran eastward through Afghanistan and Pakistan, across the foothills of the Himalayas in India and Myanmar to mainland Southeast Asia, except Malaysia. Its range in northeastern and southern China is patchy, and it is absent in much of east-central China. Other population clusters exist in the southern Russian Far East and in North Korea. A small remnant population survives in South Korea. It also occurs on the Japanese islands of Honshu and Shikoku, as well as on Taiwan and the Chinese island of Hainan.

It typically inhabits deciduous forests, mixed forests and thornbrush forests. In the summer, it usually inhabits elevations of around in the Himalayas but rarely above . In winter, it descends to elevations below . In Japan, it also occurs at sea level.

There is no definitive estimate as to the number of Asian black bears: Japan posed estimates of 8–14,000 bears living on Honshū, though the reliability of this is now doubted. Although their reliability is unclear, rangewide estimates of 5–6,000 Asian black bears have been presented by Russian biologists. In 2012, Japanese Ministry of the Environment estimated the population at 15–20,000. Rough density estimates without corroborating methodology or data have been made in India and Pakistan, resulting in the estimates of 7–9,000 in India and 1,000 in Pakistan. Unsubstantiated estimates from China give varying estimates between 15 and 46,000, with a government estimate of 28,000.

=== Bangladesh ===
The Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh conducted an on-field survey of bears in Bangladesh from 2008 to 2010 that included Asian black bears. The survey was done in 87 different places, mostly in the north-central, northeastern and southeastern areas of Bangladesh that had historical presence of bears. The survey result says that most of the areas still has some isolated small bear populations, mainly the Asian black bears. According to the survey, the most evidence found relating to bears were of Asian black bears that included nests, footprints, local sightings, etc. There are many reports on the presence of Asian black bears in the central, north-central, northeastern and southeastern parts of Bangladesh.

Although Asian black bears still occur in different parts of Bangladesh, mainly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the population is very small. Conservationists fear that the species will soon be extinct in the country if necessary steps to protect it are not taken in the near future.

=== China ===
Three subspecies of the Asian black bear occur in China: the Tibetan subspecies (&quot;U. thibetanus thibetanus&quot;), the Indochinese subspecies (&quot;U. thibetanus mupinensis&quot;), and the northeastern subspecies (&quot;U. thibetanus ussuricus&quot;), which is the only subspecies of bear in northeastern China. Asian black bears are mainly distributed in the conifer forests in the cold and temperate zones of northeast China, the main areas being Changbai, Zhang Guangcai, Lao Ye, and the Lesser Xingan Mountains. Within Liaoning province, there are about 100 Asian black bears, which only inhabit the five counties of Xinbin, Huanren, Benxi, Kuandian, and Fencheng. Within Jilin province, Asian black bears occur mainly in the counties of Hunchun, Dunhua, Wangqing, Antu, Changbai, Fusong, Jiaohe, Huadian, Panshi, and Shulan. In Heilongjiang province, Asian black bears occur in the counties of Ningan, Bayan, Wuchang, Tonghe, Baoqing, Fuyuan, Yichun, Taoshan, Lanxi, Tieli, Sunwu, Aihui, Dedu, Beian, and Nenjiang. This population has a northern boundary of about 50° N and the southern boundary in Fengcheng is about 40°30&quot; N.

=== Korea ===
By the 1990s, poaching, habitat destruction, and eradication during the Japanese occupation had led to the local extinction of the species from South Korea. In 2004, the South Korean government initiated a reintroduction program in Jiri Mountain National Park. The effort has been successful, with bears now inhabiting the park and dispersing into northern forests. In 2021, the park&#x27;s bear population appeared to have reached its carrying capacity. In Korea, most of the Asian black bears live in the broad-leaved forest of the alpine region, more than 1,500 meters north of Jirisan. As of April 2018, there were 56 bears living in the wild of Jirisan.

=== Pakistan ===
A historical and fundamental study from 1977 has provided a first comprehensive overview of the Asiatic black bear distribution across various regions of the Pakistan, including Kaghan Valley, Neelum, Astore, Dir, Kohistan, Chitral, Chilas, Rondu Valley, Gabral, Khanspur, Muree Hills, Koh e Sufaid, Kuchmina, Shin Ghar, Takht e Suliman, Khalifat Ziarat, Wam Tangi, Kalat, Kharan, Khuzdar, Jhal Jao Hills, Pab Range Hills, and Kirthar Hills. However, since then, many of these areas have not been revisited to confirm its presence, particularly in the southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Sindh. According to a 2025 review, the studies on the Asiatic black bear were mainly focused on the Himalayan black bear in the northern regions of Pakistan, mainly in the Hindukush Himalayas, with Mansehra district and Azad Jammu Kashmir as main research areas, in Mansehra district, particularly in areas such as Kaghan and the Siran Valley, including Neelum, Machiara National Park, Pir Chinasi, Pir Hasimar, Musk Deer National Park, Toli Pir National Park, Moji Game Reserve, Banjosa, Leepa Valley, Hatian Bala, Haveli, Bagh, and Muzaffarabad, and in other areas such as Battagram, Kohistan, Bajaur, Astore, Diamer, and Kumrat. The Baluchistan black bear occurs throughout the mountainous Balochistan region in western Pakistan, south-eastern Iran and south-western Afghanistan. The Baluchistan black bear is now limited in southwestern Pakistan and southeast Iran.

=== Siberia ===
In Siberia, the Asian black bear&#x27;s northern range runs from Innokenti Bay on the coast of the Sea of Japan southwest to the elevated areas of Sikhote Alin crossing it at the sources of the Samarga River. At this point, the boundary directs itself to the north, through the middle course of the Khor, Anyui and Khungari rivers, and comes to the shore of the Amur, crossing it at the level of the mouth of the Gorin River. Along the Amur river, the species&#x27; presence has been noted as far as 51° N. Lat. From there, the territorial boundary runs southwest of the river&#x27;s left bank, passing through the northern part of Lake Bolon and the juncture point of the Kur and Tunguska. Asian black bears are encountered in the Urmi&#x27;s lower course. Within the Ussuri krai, the species is restricted to broad-leaved Manchurian-type forests.

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwan, the endemic subspecies of Asian black bear, the Formosan black bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus formosanus&quot;), is confined to the mountain ranges in the central regions of the island. It lives along the Central and Snow Mountain Range, with populations in the latter being more common. The largest population seems to live in Lala mountain in Chatienshan Reserve, the (Snow) Mountain area in Shei-Pa National Park and Taroko National Park south to Tawushan Reserve through Yushan National Park. It inhabits rugged areas at elevations of . This population is estimated to comprise 200 to 600 individuals.

== Behavior and ecology ==

Asian black bears are diurnal, though they become nocturnal near human habitations. They will walk in a procession of largest to smallest. They are good climbers of rocks and trees, and will climb to feed, rest, sun, elude enemies and hibernate. Some older bears may become too heavy to climb. Half of their life is spent in trees and they are one of the largest arboreal mammals. In the Ussuri territory in the Russian Far East, Asian black bears can spend up to 15% of their time in trees. Asian black bears break branches and twigs to place under themselves when feeding on trees, thus causing many trees in their home ranges to have nest-like structures on their tops. Asian black bears will rest for short periods in nests on trees standing fifteen feet or higher.

Asian black bears do not hibernate over most of their range. They may hibernate in their colder, northern ranges, though some bears will simply move to lower elevations. Nearly all pregnant sows hibernate. Asian black bears prepare their dens for hibernation in mid-October, and will sleep from November until March. Their dens can either be dug-out hollow trees (60 feet above ground), caves or holes in the ground, hollow logs, or steep, mountainous and sunny slopes. They may also den in abandoned brown bear dens. Asian black bears tend to den at lower elevations and on less steep slopes than brown bears. Female Asian black bears emerge from dens later than do males, and female Asian black bears with cubs emerge later than barren females. Asian black bears tend to be less mobile than brown bears. With sufficient food, Asian black bears can remain in an area of roughly , and sometimes even as little as .

Asian black bears have a wide range of vocalizations, including grunts, whines, roars, slurping sounds (sometimes made when feeding) and &quot;an appalling row&quot; when wounded, alarmed or angry. They emit loud hisses when issuing warnings or threats, and scream when fighting. When approaching other bears, they produce &quot;tut tut&quot; sounds, thought to be produced by bears snapping their tongue against the roof of their mouth. When courting, they emit clucking sounds.

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
Within Sikhote-Alin, the breeding season of Asian black bears occurs earlier than in brown bears, starting from mid-June to mid-August. Birth also occurs earlier, in mid-January. By October, the uterine horns of pregnant females grow to . By late December, the embryos weigh 75 grams. Sows generally have their first litter at the age of three years. Pregnant females generally make up 14% of populations. Similar to brown bears, Asian black bears have delayed implantation. Sows usually give birth in caves or hollow trees in winter or early spring after a gestation period of 200–240 days. Cubs weigh 13 ounces at birth, and will begin walking at four days of age, and open their eyes three days later. The skulls of newborn Asian black bear cubs bear great resemblance to those of adult sun bears. Litters can consist of 1–4 cubs, with 2 being the average. Cubs have a slow growth rate, reaching only 2.5 kg by May. Asian black bear cubs will nurse for 104–130 weeks, and become independent at 24–36 months. There is usually a 2–3 year interval period before females produce subsequent litters. The average lifespan in the wild is 25 years, while the oldest Asian black bear in captivity died at the age of 44.

=== Feeding ===

Asian black bears are omnivorous, and will feed on insects, beetle larvae, invertebrates, termites, grubs, carrion, bees, eggs, garbage, mushrooms, grasses, bark, roots, tubers, fruits, nuts, seeds, honey, herbs, acorns, cherries, dogwood, and grain. Although herbivorous to a greater degree than brown bears, and more carnivorous than American black bears, Asian black bears are not as specialized in their diet as giant pandas are: while giant pandas depend on a constant supply of low calorie, yet abundant foodstuffs, Asian black bears are more opportunistic and have opted for a nutritional boom-or-bust economy. They thus gorge themselves on a variety of seasonal high calorie foods, storing the excess calories as fat, and then hibernate during times of scarcity. Asian black bears will eat pine nuts and acorns of the previous year in the April–May period. In times of scarcity, they enter river valleys to gain access to hazelnuts and insect larvae in rotting logs. From mid-May through late June, they will supplement their diet with green vegetation and fruit. Through July to September, they will climb trees to eat bird cherries, pine cones, vines and grapes. On rare occasions they will eat dead fish during the spawning season, though this constitutes a much lesser portion of their diet than in brown bears. In the 1970s, Asian black bears were reported to kill and eat Hanuman langurs in Nepal. They appear to be more carnivorous than most other bears, including American black bears, and will kill ungulates with some regularity, including domestic livestock. Wild ungulate prey can include muntjacs, serow, takin, malayan tapir wild boar and adult water buffaloes, which they kill by breaking their necks.

=== Interspecific predatory relationships ===

The Asian black bear&#x27;s range overlaps with that of the sloth bear in central and southern India, the sun bear in Southeast Asia and the brown bear in the southern part of the Russian Far East. Asian black bears seem to intimidate Himalayan brown bears in direct encounters. They eat the fruit dropped by Asian black bears from trees, as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb. Ussuri brown bears may attack Asian black bears.

Asian black bears are occasionally attacked by tigers and brown bears. Leopards are known to prey on bear cubs younger than two years old. Packs of wolves and Eurasian lynxes are potential predators of bear cubs as well.
Asian black bears usually dominate Amur leopards in physical confrontations in heavily vegetated areas, while leopards are uppermost in open areas, though the outcome of such encounters is largely dependent on the size of the individual animals.

Tigers occasionally attack and consume Asian black bears. Russian hunters found their remains in tiger scats, and Asian black bear carcasses showing evidence of tiger predation. To escape tigers, Asian black bears rush up a tree and wait for the tiger to leave, though some tigers will pretend to leave, and wait for the bear to descend. Tigers prey foremost on young bears.
Some are very tenacious when attacked: Jim Corbett observed a fight between a tiger and the largest Asian black bear he had ever seen. The bear managed to chase off the tiger, despite having half its nose and scalp torn off. He twice saw Asian black bears carry off tiger kills when the latter was absent.
Asian black bears are usually safe from tiger attacks once they reach five years of age. One fatal attack of a tiger on a juvenile Asian black bear has been recorded in Jigme Dorji National Park.
One Siberian tiger was reported to have lured an Asian black bear by imitating its mating call. However, Asian black bears are probably less vulnerable to tiger attacks than brown bears, due to their habit of living in hollows or in close set rocks.

== Conservation ==
The Asian black bear is listed as a protected animal in China&#x27;s National Protection Wildlife Law, which stipulates that anyone hunting or catching bears without permits will be subject to severe punishment.

Although the Asian black bear is protected in India, due to being listed as vulnerable in the Red Data Book in Appendix I of CITES in India and in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act and its 1991 amendment, it has been difficult to prosecute those accused of poaching Asian black bears due to lack of witnesses and lack of Wildlife Forensic Labs to detect the originality of confiscated animal parts or products. Moreover, due to India&#x27;s wide-stretching boundaries with other nations such as Pakistan, Tibet, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, it is difficult to police such borders, which are often in mountainous terrain.

Five Asian black bear populations, occurring in Kyushu, Shikoku, West-Chugoku, East-Chugoku and Kii areas, were listed as endangered by the Environmental Agency in the Japanese Red Data Book in 1991. Small isolated populations in the Tanzawa and Shimokita areas of mainland Honshū were listed as endangered in 1995. Beyond recognizing these populations as endangered, there is still a lack of efficient conservation methods for Japanese black bears.

Asian black bears occur as an infrequent species in the Red Data Book of Russia, thus falling under special protection and hunting is prohibited. There is currently a strong movement to legalize the hunting of Russian black bears, which is supported by most of the local scientific community.

As of January 30, 1989, Taiwan&#x27;s Formosan black bears have been listed as an endangered species under the Natural and Cultural Heritage Act on, and was later listed as a Conserved Species Category I.

The Vietnamese government issued Decision 276/QD, 276/1989, which prohibits the hunting and exporting of Asian black bears. The Red Book of Vietnam lists Vietnamese black bears as endangered.

The Korean Government designated the Asian black bear as Natural Monument No. 329 and it is considered an extinction crisis. At the present time, the Endangered Species Restoration Center of Korea National Park Service is going through species restoration business.

== Threats ==

The main habitat threat to Asian black bears is overcutting of forests, mainly due to human populations increasing to over 430,000 in regions where bears are distributed, in the Shaanxi, Ganshu, and Sichuan provinces. 27 forestry enterprises were built in these areas between 1950 and 1985 (excluding the lumbering units belonging to the county). By the early 1990s, the Asian black bear distribution area was reduced to only one-fifth of the area that existed before the 1940s. Isolated bear populations face environmental and genetic stress in these circumstances. However, one of the most important reasons for their decrease involves overhunting, as Asian black bear paws, gall bladders and cubs have great economic value. Asian black bear harvests are maintained at a high level due to the harm they cause to crops, orchards and bee farms. During the 1950s and 1960s, 1,000 Asian black bears were harvested annually in the Heilongjiang Province. However, purchased furs were reduced by 4/5, even by 9/10 yearly in the late 1970s to the early 1980s. Asian black bears have also been declining annually in Dehong Dai and Jingpo Nations Autonomous Prefecture and the Yunnan Province.

Poaching for gall bladders and skin are the main threats faced by Asian black bears in India.

Although the poaching of Asian black bears is well known throughout Japan, authorities have done little to remedy the situation. The killing of nuisance bears is practiced year-round, and harvest numbers have been on the increase. Box traps have been widely used since 1970 to capture nuisance bears. It is estimated that the number of shot bears will decrease in time, due to the decline of old traditional hunters and the increase of a younger generation less inclined to hunt. Logging is also considered a threat.

Although Asian black bears have been afforded protection in Russia since 1983, illegal poaching, fueled by a growing demand for bear parts in the Asian market, is still a major threat to the Russian population. Many workers of Chinese and Korean origin, supposedly employed in the timber industry, are actually involved in the illegal trade. Some Russian sailors reportedly purchase bear parts from local hunters to sell them to Japanese and Southeast Asian clients. Russia&#x27;s rapidly growing timber industry has been a serious threat to the Asian black bear&#x27;s home range for three decades. The cutting of trees containing cavities deprives Asian black bears of their main source of dens, and forces them to den on the ground or in rocks, thus making them more vulnerable to tigers, brown bears and hunters.

In Taiwan, Asian black bears are not actively pursued, though steel traps set out for wild boars have been responsible for unintentional bear trappings. Timber harvesting has largely stopped being a major threat to Taiwan&#x27;s Asian black bear population, though a new policy concerning the transfer of ownership of hill land from the government to private interests has the potential to affect some lowland habitat, particularly in the eastern part of the nation. The building of new cross island highways through bear habitat is also potentially threatening.

Vietnamese black bear populations have declined rapidly due to the pressures of human population growth and unstable settlement. Vietnamese forests have been shrinking: of the of natural forests, about disappear every year. Hunting pressures have also increased with a coinciding decline of environmental awareness.

South Korea remains one of two countries to allow bear bile farming to continue legally. As reported in 2009, approximately 1,374 Asian black bears reside in an estimated 74 bear farms, where they are kept for slaughter to fuel the demands of traditional Asian medicine. In sharp contrast, fewer than 20 Asian black bears can be found at Jirisan Restoration Center, located in Korea&#x27;s Jirisan National Park.

== Relationships with humans ==
=== In folklore and literature ===
In Japanese culture, the Asian black bear is traditionally associated with the mountain spirit (&quot;yama no kami&quot;) and is characterized variously as &quot;mountain man&quot; (&quot;&quot;), &quot;mountain uncle&quot; (), &quot;mountain father&quot; (), a loving mother, and a child. Being a largely solitary creature, the Asian black bear is also viewed as &quot;lonely person&quot; (&quot;sabishigariya&quot;). Asian black bears feature very little in lowland Japanese folklore, but are prominent in upland Japan, a fact thought to reflect the bear&#x27;s greater economic value in upland areas. According to the local folklore in Kituarahara-gun in Niigata, the Asian black bear received its white mark after being given a silk-wrapped amulet by , which left the mark after being removed.
In Hindu mythology, the Asian black bear Jambavantha (also known as Jambavan or Jamvanta) is believed to have lived from Treta Yuga to Dvapara Yuga. In the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Jambavantha assists Rama in finding his wife Sita and battle her abductor, Ravana.

The Asian black bear in Thailand is called &quot;mi khwai&quot; (), meaning &quot;buffalo bear&quot;, not due to its appearance, but a v-shaped patch of fur under its neck similar to that of a buffalo. There is also a Thai idiom &quot;bon meuan mi kin pheung&quot; (), literally &quot;grumbling like a bear eating honey&quot;, referring to people who display behaviors of grumbling and mumbling express dissatisfaction. This idiom comes from the behavior of this species of bear when it climbs trees in search of honey and young bees. While eating honey, it makes a murmuring sound.

Asian black bears are briefly mentioned in Yann Martel&#x27;s novel &quot;The Life of Pi&quot;, in which they are described by the protagonist&#x27;s father as being among the most dangerous animals in his zoo.

=== Attacks on humans ===
Although usually shy and cautious animals, Asian black bears are more aggressive towards humans than the brown bears of Eurasia and American black bears. David W. Macdonald theorizes that this greater aggression is an adaptation to being sympatric with tigers. According to Brigadier General R. G. Burton:

In response to a chapter on Asian black bears written by Robert Armitage Sterndale in his &quot;Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon&quot; on how Asian black bears were no more dangerous than other animals in India, a reader responded with a letter to &quot;The Asian&quot; on May 11, 1880:

At the turn of the 20th century, a hospital in Srinagar, Kashmir received dozens of Asian black bear victims annually. When Asian black bears attack humans, they rear up on their hind legs and knock victims over with their front paws. Then they bite them on an arm or leg and snap on the victim&#x27;s head, this being the most dangerous part of the attack.
Asian black bear attacks have been increasing in Kashmir since the Kashmir conflict. In November 2009, in the Kulgam district of Indian-administered Kashmir, an Asian black bear attacked four insurgents after discovering them in its den, and killed two of them.

In India, attacks on humans have been increasing yearly, and have occurred largely in the northwestern and western Himalayan region. In the Chamba District of Himachal Pradesh, the number of Asian black bear attacks on humans has gradually increased from 10 in 1988–89 to 21 in 1991–92. There are no records of predation on humans by Asian black bears in Russia, and no conflicts have been documented in Taiwan. Asian black bear attacks on humans were reported from Junbesi in Langtang National Park, Nepal in 2005, and occurred in villages as well as in the surrounding forest.

Nine people were killed by Asian black bears in Japan between 1979 and 1989. In September 2009, an Asian black bear attacked a group of 9 tourists, seriously injuring four of them at a bus station in the built-up area of Takayama, Gifu.
The majority of attacks tend to occur when Asian black bears are encountered suddenly, and in close quarters. Because of this, Asian black bears are generally considered more dangerous than brown bears, which live in more open spaces and are thus less likely to be surprised by approaching humans. They are also likely to attack when protecting food.

2016 saw several attacks by Asian black bears in Japan. In May and June four people were killed by Asian black bears in Akita prefecture while picking bamboo shoots, and in August a female safari park worker in Gunma prefecture was killed when an Asian black bear climbed into her car and attacked her.

=== Livestock predation and crop damage ===
In the past, the farmers of the Himalayan lowlands feared Asian black bears more than any other pest, and would erect platforms in the fields, where watchmen would be posted at night and would beat drums to frighten off any interlopers. However, some Asian black bears would grow accustomed to the sound and encroach anyway.

Of 1,375 livestock kills examined in Bhutan, Asian black bears accounted for 8% of attacks. Livestock predation, overall, was greatest in the summer and autumn periods, which corresponded with a peak in cropping agriculture; livestock are turned out to pasture and forest during the cropping season and, subsequently, are less well-guarded than at other times.

Livestock killed by Asian black bears in Himachal Pradesh, India increased from 29 in 1988–1989 to 45 in 1992–1993.

In the remoter areas of Japan, Asian black bears can be serious crop predators: the bears feed on cultivated bamboo shoots in spring, on plums, watermelons and corn in the summer, and on persimmons, sweet potatoes and rice in the autumn. Japanese black bears are estimated to damage 3,000 bee hives annually. When feeding on large crops such as watermelons or pumpkins, Asian black bears will ignore the flesh and eat the seeds, thus adversely affecting future harvests. Asian black bears can girdle and kill trees by stripping their bark for the sap. This can cause serious economic problems in Asia&#x27;s valuable timber forests. In the late 1970s, 400–1,200 hectares of land had been affected by Asian black bears bark-stripping Japanese conifers. There is evidence that 70-year-old conifers (commanding the highest market values) may also have been bark-stripped.

Asian black bears will prey on livestock if their natural food is in poor supply. They have been known to attack bullocks, either killing them outright, or eating them alive.

=== Tameability and trainability ===
Along with sun bears, Asian black bears are the most typically used species in areas where bears are used either in performances or as pets. Asian black bears have an outstanding learning ability in captivity, and are among the most common species used in circus acts. According to Gary Brown:

Asian black bears are easily tamed, and can be fed with rice, maize, sweet potatoes, cassavas, pumpkins, ripe fruit, animal fat and sweet foods. Keeping captive Asian black bears is popular in China, especially due to the belief that milking the bear&#x27;s gall bladder leads to quick prosperity. Asian black bears are also popular as pets in Vietnam.

=== Hunting and exploitation ===
==== Hunting ====

According to &quot;The Great and Small Game of India, Burma, and Tibet&quot;, regarding the hunting of Asian black bears in British India:

The book also describes a second method of black bear hunting involving the beating of small patches of forest, when the bears march out in single file. However, black bears were rarely hunted for sport, because of the poor quality of their fur and the ease by which they could be shot in trees, or stalked, as their hearing was poor.

Although easy to track and shoot, Asian black bears were known by British sportsmen to be extremely dangerous when injured. Brigadier General R.G. Burton wrote of how many sportsmen had been killed by Asian black bears after failing to make direct hits.

Today, Asian black bears are only legally hunted for sport in Japan and Russia. In Russia, 75–100 Asian black bears are legally harvested annually, though 500 a year are reportedly harvested illegally.

After the introduction of Buddhism in Japan, which prohibited the killing of animals, the Japanese compromised by devising different strategies in hunting bears. Some, such as the inhabitants of the Kiso area in the Nagano Prefecture, prohibited the practice altogether, while others developed rituals in order to placate the spirits of killed bears. In some Japanese hunting communities, Asian black bears lacking the white chest mark are considered sacred. In the Akita Prefecture, bears lacking the mark were known by &quot;matagi&quot; huntsmen as (all-black) or (black-chested), and were also considered messengers of &#x27;. If such a bear was shot, the huntsman would offer it to &#x27;, and give up hunting from that time on. Similar beliefs were held in Nagano, where the completely black Asian black bears were termed or cat-bear. communities believed that killing an Asian black bear in the mountains would result in a bad storm, which was linked to the belief that bear spirits could affect weather. The would generally hunt Asian black bears in spring or from late autumn to early winter, before they hibernated. In mountain regions, Asian black bears were hunted by driving them upland to a waiting hunter, who would then shoot it. Bear hunting expeditions were preceded by rituals, and could last up to two weeks. After killing the bear, the would pray for the bear&#x27;s soul. Asian black bear hunts in Japan are often termed , meaning &quot;bear conquest&quot;. The word itself is often used in Japanese folklore to describe the slaying of monsters and demons.

Traditionally, the Atayal, Taroko, and Bunun people of Taiwan consider Asian black bears to be almost human in their behaviors, and thus unjust killing of bears is equated with murder and will cause misfortunes such as disease, death, or crop failure. The Bunun people call Asian black bears &quot;Aguman&quot; or &quot;Duman&quot;, which means devil. Traditionally, a Bunun hunter who has accidentally trapped an Asian black bear has to build a cottage in the mountains and cremate the bear within it. The hunter must stay in the cottage alone, away from the village until the end of the millet harvest, as it is believed that the killing of an Asian black bear will cause the millet crop to burn black. In the Tungpu area, Asian black bears are considered animals of the &quot;third category&quot;: animals with the most remote relationship to humans and whose activity is restricted outside human settlements. Therefore, when Asian black bears encroach upon human settlements, they are considered ill omens. In this situation, the community can either destroy the trespassing bears or settle somewhere else. The Rukai and Paiwan people are permitted to hunt Asian black bears, though they believe that doing so will curse the hunters involved: Rukai people believe that hunting Asian black bears can result in disease. Children are forbidden from eating bear meat, which is itself not permitted to be taken within homes.

==== Products ====
Asian black bears have been hunted for their body parts in China since the Stone Age.
In the 19th century, its fur was considered of low value. Grease was the only practical use for their carcasses in British India, and bears living near villages were considered ideal, as they were almost invariably fatter than forest-dwelling ones. In the former USSR, the Asian black bear yielded fur, meat and fat of greater quality than those of the brown bear.
Today, bile is in demand, as it supposedly cures various diseases, treats the accumulation of blood below the skin, and counters toxic effects. Products also include bone &#x27;glue&#x27; and fat, both used in traditional medicine and consumed as a tonic. Asian black bear meat is also edible.

<doc id="616979" wikidata="Q133292" url="?curid=616979" title="Scilloideae">
<text>Scilloideae (named after the genus &quot;Scilla&quot;, &quot;squill&quot;) is a subfamily of bulbous plants within the family &quot;Asparagaceae&quot;. Scilloideae is sometimes treated as a separate family Hyacinthaceae, named after the genus &quot;Hyacinthus&quot;. Scilloideae or Hyacinthaceae include many familiar garden plants such as &quot;Hyacinthus&quot; (hyacinths), &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot; (bluebells), &quot;Muscari&quot; (grape hyacinths) and &quot;Scilla&quot; and &quot;Puschkinia&quot; (squills or scillas). Some are important as cut flowers.

Scilloideae are distributed mostly in Mediterranean climates, including South Africa, Central Asia and South America. Their flowers have six tepals and six stamens with a superior ovary, which previously placed them within the lily family (Liliaceae), and their leaves are fleshy, mucilaginous, and arranged in a basal rosette.

The Scilloideae, like most lily-like monocots, were at one time placed in a very broadly defined lily family (Liliaceae). The subfamily is recognized in modern classification systems such as the APG III system of 2009. It is also treated as the separate family Hyacinthaceae, as it is by many researchers and was in earlier APG systems. Determining the boundaries between genera within the Scilloideae is an active area of research. The number of genera varies widely from source to source, from about 30 to about 70. The situation has been described as being in a &quot;state of flux&quot;.

== Description ==


The subfamily contains many popular spring-flowering garden bulbs, such as hyacinths (&quot;Hyacinthus&quot;), grape hyacinths (&quot;Muscari&quot;), bluebells (&quot;Hyacinthoides&quot;) and squills (&quot;Scilla&quot;). Other members are summer- and autumn-flowering, including &quot;Galtonia&quot; and &quot;Eucomis&quot; (&#x27;pineapple lilies&#x27;). Most are native to Mediterranean climate zones and neighboring areas in the Mediterranean Basin and South Africa. Others are found in Central Asia, the Far East and South America.

Morphologically the subfamily is characterised by having 6 tepals and 6 stamens with a superior ovary, a characteristic which placed them within the older order of Liliales in many older classification systems, such as the Cronquist system, but they now separate from them within the Asparagales order. They have also been included in the family Liliaceae.

Roots: contractile and mucilaginous.

Leaves: fleshy and mucilaginous arranged in a basal rosette, alternate and spiral, simple, margin entire, with parallel venation, sheathing at the base, without stipules and hair simple.

Flowers: arranged in scapiflorous inflorescences (in racemes, in spikes, and in heads). The peduncles are articulated. The flowers are hermaphroditic, actinomorphic, often showy.

Perianths: six tepals divided into two whorls, free or joined (connate). When joined, the perianth forms a tubular bell. The tepals are imbricate and petaloid. The corolla may be white, yellow, violet, blue, brown and even black (see images).

Androecium: composed of 6 stamens (exceptionally 3, as in Albuca, for example), with the filaments free or adnate to the tube, often appendiculate. The anthers are dorsifixed and pollen dehiscence occurs by longitudinal openings. The pollen is monosulcate (having a linear furrow).

Gynoecium: superior ovary, tricarpelate, connate and trilocular. Single stigma, capitate to 3-lobed. May contain from one to several ovules in each locule. They have nectaries at the septa of the ovaries.

Fruit: dehiscence loculicidal.

Seed: Seed morphology is diverse, from globular to flattened, and occasionally aril. The seed coat usually contains phytomelan (phytomelanin), one of the defining characteristics of the order, a black pigment present in the seed coat, creating a dark crust.

Chromosomes: Chromosome size varies widely, from 1.2 to 18 μm in length, karyotype bimodal or trimodal. The basic chromosome number is also very variable (X = 2, 6, 7, 10, 15, 17, etc.).

== Systematics ==
When treated as a subfamily, the name Scilloideae is derived from the generic name of the type genus, &quot;Scilla&quot;, and is attributed to Gilbert Thomas Burnett in 1835. When treated as a family, the name Hyacinthaceae is derived from the type genus &quot;Hyacinthus&quot;, and is usually attributed to August Batsch from (&quot;ex&quot;) a 1797 publication by Moritz Borkhausen.

=== Phylogeny ===

The monophyly of Scilloideae is well supported by studies based on molecular data. These studies also give support to the exclusion of &quot;Camassia&quot;, &quot;Chlorogalum&quot; and related genera, i.e. the former Hyacinthaceae subfamily Chlorogaloideae, now placed in the subfamily Agavoideae.

The exact position of the Scilloideae within the broadly defined Asparagaceae is less clear. One possible phylogeny for the seven subfamilies recognised within the family is shown below.

Although generally agreeing on the main division of the Asparagaceae into two clades, studies have produced slightly different relationships among the Agavoideae, Aphyllanthoideae, Brodiaeoideae and Scilloideae. For example, Seberg et al. (2012) present analyses based on parsimony and on maximum likelihood. In the first, the Scilloideae are sister to the Agavoideae; in the second, they are sister to the Brodiaeoideae.

=== Early classifications ===

Detailed historical accounts of taxonomic issues relating to the modern subfamily Scilloideae have been provided by Pfosser &amp; Speta (1999) and Chase et al. (2009). The lilioid monocots have long created classification problems. At one extreme, e.g. in the Cronquist system of 1968, they have been regarded as one large family (Liliaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;). At the other extreme, e.g. in the Dahlgren system of 1985, they have been divided between orders and split into many often small families. Dahlgren divided the lilioid monocots in search of monophyly, but in practice he was unsuccessful. His major contribution was to split the Liliaceae into two families, the true Liliaceae, Liliaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, and the Hyacinthaceae (families which are now placed in separate orders, Liliales and Asparagales).

Splitting off the Hyacinthaceae from the Liliaceae was originally suggested by Batsch in 1786. Batsch&#x27;s version of the family only superficially resembles the modern version, but did include &quot;Hyacinthus&quot; and &quot;Lachenalia&quot;. The group was reduced to a tribe by Endlicher in 1836, and included &quot;Camassia&quot;. In 1866 Salisbury redistributed the genera into several families.
In the 1870s, Baker used tribes to divide up the Liliaceae &quot;s.l.&quot;. introducing the Hyacintheae, Scilleae, Massonieae, and Chlorogaleae. In 1887 Engler divided the Liliaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; into two tribes, Lilieaoe and Scilleae. In the twentieth century, Fritsch proposed the division of Liliaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; into smaller more homogeneous families. In the 1930s the Viennese school elevated Engler&#x27;s tribes to subfamilies. They questioned the inclusion of such different groups as Lilioideae and Scilloideae within the same family, and even Scilloideae was considered to be composed of at least three groups. By 1969, Huber was recognizing the Scilloideae as the family Hyacinthaceae, and dividing it into tribes. How many tribes were recognised and how the genera were distributed within those tribes depended on the diagnostic characters chosen. Huber used seeds, while Schulze in 1980 used pollen. Morphology and chromosome analysis were supplemented by chemotaxonomy, due to the presence of cardiac steroids, such as the bufadienolids in the Urgineoideae and cardenolids in Ornithogaloideae. Even Linnaean genera such as &quot;Hyacinthus&quot;, &quot;Scilla&quot; and &quot;Ornithoglum&quot; proved heterogeneous and characters useful in other families failed to define satisfactory taxa.

=== Modern classifications ===

Modern classification systems for plants are largely derived from molecular phylogenetic analysis. The initial molecular analysis of the Liliaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; was based on the Dahlgren system, as for example in the work by Chase et al. in 1995. When it was discovered that the Dahlgren families were not monophyletic, the tendency was to create new families out of each identified clade, as in the first Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system of 1998, the APG system. This placed many lilioid families and genera in the order Asparagales (a term derived from Dahlgren, and the largest monocot order). One of the 29 families into which the Asparagales were divided was the Hyacinthaceae.

With further work it was evident that these 29 families, some of which had few genera, could be grouped into larger clades. The APG II system of 2003 was a compromise. It divided the Asparagales into 14 broadly defined families, while allowing an alternative system in which some of the larger families could be replaced by smaller ones. The Hyacinthaceae was one of these optional smaller families, which could alternatively be sunk into a broadly defined Asparagaceae.

This compromise approach was abandoned in the APG III system of 2009, which allowed only the broader families. The paper presenting the system states &quot;The area around Asparagaceae is difficult from the standpoint of circumscription. Although Asparagaceae s.l. are heterogeneous and poorly characterized, Asparagaceae s.s., Agavaceae, Laxmanniaceae, Ruscaceae and even Hyacinthaceae have few if any distinctive features.&quot; At the same time, Chase et al. provided subfamilies to replace the alternative narrowly defined families of APG II. The Hyacinthaceae became the subfamily Scilloideae of the family Asparagaceae.

Many sources have adopted the APG III system; for example, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families places genera such as &quot;Hyacinthus&quot; only in the broadly defined Asparagaceae. Other sources prefer to retain the narrower families of APG II; for example, Seberg et al. say that it &quot;remains a moot point whether the difficult-to-recognize bracketed families of APG II are a worse or a better choice than the equally difficult-to-recognize subfamilies of APG III&quot;, and in their analyses of the phylogeny of the Asparagales they continue to use families such as Hyacinthaceae.

=== Tribes ===

In 1990, Pfosser and Speta stated that their earlier classification of the Hyacinthaceae into the subfamilies Hyacinthoideae, Ornithogaloideae, Oziroeoideae and Urgineoideae continued to be supported by ongoing studies. (They further divided the subfamilies Hyacinthoideae and Ornithogaloideae into tribes.) A part of reducing the Hyacinthaceae to the subfamily Scilloideae, Chase et al. (2009) suggested dividing it into four tribes, corresponding to Pfosser and Speta&#x27;s four subfamilies: Hyacintheae , Ornithogaleae , Oziroëeae and Urgineeae . The possible relationship of the four tribes is represented in the following cladogram, which has, however, only &quot;moderate&quot; statistical support.

The exact boundaries between genera within these tribes remains controversial; the situation has been described as being in a &quot;state of flux&quot;.

==== Oziroëeae ====
Species are found only in western South America. They have flowers with stamens which are joined to the petals, rounded seeds and the embryo as long as the seed. The basic chromosome numbers are &quot;n&quot; = 15, 17. The tribe contains only the genus &quot;Oziroë&quot;.

==== Ornithogaleae ====
In terms of the number of species, this is the largest tribe. Its species are distributed in Europe, western Asia and Africa. They have flowers with three stamens which have flattened filaments. Their seeds are flattened and angular. The basic chromosome numbers range from &quot;n&quot; = 2 to &quot;n&quot; = 10. In the treatment by Manning et al. (2009) and Stevens at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, the tribe contains four genera, &quot;Albuca&quot; (about 110–140 species), &quot;Dipcadi&quot;, &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; (about 160 species, including &quot;Galtonia&quot; and &quot;Neopatersonia&quot;) and &quot;Pseudogaltonia&quot;. By contrast, Martínez-Azorín et al. (2011) divide the tribe into 19 genera.

==== Urgineeae ====

Species within this tribe contain bufadienolides and are distributed mainly in Africa, Madagascar, and the Mediterranean through to India. The seeds are flattened and winged with the head barely attached to the endosperm. The basic chromosome numbers are &quot;n&quot; = 6, 7 and 10. Depending on the source, the tribe may include the genera &quot;Bowiea&quot;, &quot;Drimia&quot; (including &quot;Urginea&quot;), &quot;Schizobasis&quot; (sometimes included in &quot;Drimia&quot;) and &quot;Fusifilum&quot; (also sometimes included in &quot;Drimia&quot;).

==== Hyacintheae ====

In terms of the number of species, this is the second largest tribe. Its species have leaves with pustules or spots, rounded seeds and contain homoisoflavanones. The tribe can in turn be divided into three clades (subtribes):

* &quot;Pseudoprospero&quot; 
: The only species in the genus, &quot;Pseudoprospero firmifolium&quot;, is from eastern South Africa. It has two ovules per carpel with one seed per locule and a basic chromosome number &quot;n&quot; = 9.

* Massoniinae 
: Species are distributed in Africa south of the Sahara and India. There are two or more ovules per carpel. The seeds have elaiosomes. The basic chromosome number is 5 to 10+ (many 20). The subtribe contains about 13–20 genera (depending on the treatment), including &quot;Daubenya&quot;, &quot;Drimiopsis&quot;, &quot;Eucomis&quot;, &quot;Lachenalia&quot; (about 110 species), &quot;Ledebouria&quot; (about 80 species), &quot;Massonia&quot; (including &quot;Whiteheadia&quot;), &quot;Merwilla&quot;, &quot;Schizocarphus&quot; and &quot;Veltheimia&quot;.

* Hyacinthinae 
: Species are distributed in Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa and the Middle East, and then again in the Far East. There are two to eight ovules per carpel; elaiosomes are present in the seeds; and the basic chromosome number is 4 to 8+. The subtribe contains about 14–25 genera (depending on the treatment), including &quot;Bellevalia&quot; (about 50 species), &quot;Brimeura&quot;, &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot;, &quot;Muscari&quot; (about 50 species), &quot;Scilla&quot; (about 30 species) and &quot;Prospero&quot; (about 25 species).

=== Genera and species ===

Some genera that were formerly placed within the Scillioideae (as Hyacinthaceae), e.g., &quot;Chlorogalum&quot; and &quot;Camassia&quot;, are currently placed in the Agavoideae.

Both historically and , there has been &quot;considerable disagreement over generic limits&quot; in the remaining Scilloideae, with different sources listing from 15 to 45 genera for sub-Saharan Africa alone. The total number of genera has been given as anything between about 30 (with about 500–700 species) and 70 (with about 1000 species).

==== List of genera ====
Unless otherwise noted, the list below is based on genera accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as in the family Asparagaceae (with synonyms from the same source), with assignments to the subfamily Scilloideae based on the Germplasm Resources Information Network. As noted above, other sources divide up some of these genera, creating a significantly larger number; thus the genus &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; as conceived by Manning et al. (2009) is divided by Martínez-Azorín et al. (2011) into a more narrowly circumscribed &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; plus an additional 11 genera.

== Distribution and ecology ==

Scilloideae are widely but discontinuously distributed. The genus &quot;Oziroe&quot; is found only in parts of western South America. Other genera occur in Africa south of the Sahara and parts of the Arabian Peninsula, on both sides of the Mediterranean, further north in Europe through the Middle East to India, and on the east coast of Asia, in China, Korea and Japan. Scilloideae are found in temperate to tropical habitats, but are more diverse in areas of Mediterranean climate (i.e., with a pronounced dry season during the summer).

Scilloideae reproduce both sexually and asexually. The showy flowers of many species of the subfamily are pollinated by a wide range of insects including bees, wasps, flies and moths, as well as birds. Both nectar and pollen act as incentives to pollinating species. Vegetative reproduction may be by bulbils or by seeds through apomixis. The dispersal of seeds may occur by water, wind, or by ants attracted by elaiosomes.

== Uses ==
=== Cultivation ===
Many members of the subfamily are popular garden plants, such as &quot;Hyacinthus&quot;, &quot;Muscari&quot;, &quot;Scilla&quot;, &quot;Puschkinia&quot;, &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot;, and &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; (including those formerly placed in &quot;Galtonia&quot;).

In South Africa the species of &quot;Eucomis&quot;, &quot;Ornithogalum&quot;, &quot;Veltheimia&quot;, among others, are grown as ornamentals. &quot;Ornithogalum thyrsoides&quot; and the different cultivars of hyacinths are important in the cut flower market.

=== Medicinal use ===
&quot;Drimia maritima&quot;, the sea squill, has been used as a medicinal plant since ancient times. Its use for treatment of edema is mentioned in a papyrus from 1554 BC, the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. Bufadienolides isolated from &quot;Drimia maritima&quot; and &quot;Drimia indica&quot; are used for the production of substances for the treatment of heart conditions.

=== Food ===

The Scilloideae are only occasionally used as food plants for humans. In Italy the bulbs of &quot;Leopoldia comosa&quot; are grown for food and in Greece they are consumed as pickles. In France the inflorescence of &quot;Ornithogalum pyrenaicum&quot; is consumed as a vegetable. In Africa some tribes consume the bulbs of &quot;Ledebouria apertiflora&quot; and &quot;Ledebouria revoluta&quot;.

== Toxicity ==
Many Scilloideae produce poisonous steroidal saponins such as bufadienolides and cardenolides, making them inedible.

Several species are toxic. In South Africa, for example, &quot;Ornithogalum thyrsoides&quot;, and several &quot;Ledebouria&quot; species (&quot;Ledebouria cooperi&quot;, &quot;L. inguinata&quot;, &quot;L. ovatifolia&quot;, &quot;L. revoluta&quot;), &quot;Ornithogalum saundersiae&quot; and several members of the tribe Urgineeae are poisonous to livestock. Scilliroside (a bufadienolide) is used to poison rats, traditionally by spreading dried chips of &quot;Drimia maritima&quot; bulbs.

<text>Orquesta típica, or simply a típica, is a Latin American term for a band which plays popular music. The details vary from country to country. The term tends to be used for groups of medium size (about 8 to 12 musicians) in some well-defined instrumental set-up.

==Argentina and Uruguay==

In Argentina and Uruguay, the term orquesta típica is associated with tango music. The orquesta típica usually comprises a string section (three or four violins, and sometimes viola and cello), three or more bandoneons, and a rhythm section (piano and double bass). An orquesta típica is an expanded version of a sexteto típico, which includes 2 bandoneons, 2 violins, double bass and piano.

==Cuba==

In Cuba, a típica is an ensemble mainly composed of wind instruments, which was very popular in the mid-19th century. One of the earliest, Orquesta Flor de Cuba, had the following make-up: cornet, trombone, figle (ophicleide), two clarinets, two violins, double bass, kettle drum, and güiro. The ophicleide was a sort of bass bugle with keys, invented in 1817, now superseded by the tuba and/or baritone horn, the name surviving for a pipe organ stop; the trombone would be more typically a valved rather than a slide instrument.

In the early 20th century, there were still several popular orquestas típicas, such as those directed by Enrique Peña and Félix González. In 1915, charangas began to replace orquestas típica, a process which was largely complete by 1925. Charangas would become, along with son conjuntos and Cuban-style big bands, one of the main precursors of the salsa ensemble, which is characterized by the inclusion of multiple trombones. Salsa ensembles can also feature trumpets along with piano, double bass, güiro, conga and bongó. In the salsa context, the term &quot;típico&quot; usually refers to the sound of the conjuntos of the 1940s, such as Arsenio Rodríguez&#x27;s, or to those of the original charangas danzoneras (charangas típicas), such as Arcaño y sus Maravillas, since orquestas típicas never reached the United States.

<doc id="616985" wikidata="Q5157263" url="?curid=616985" title="Computability logic">
<text>Computability logic (CoL) is a research program and mathematical framework for redeveloping logic as a systematic formal theory of computability, as opposed to classical logic, which is a formal theory of truth. It was introduced and so named by Giorgi Japaridze in 2003. 

In classical logic, formulas represent true/false statements. In CoL, formulas represent computational problems. In classical logic, the validity of an argument depends only on its form, not on its meaning. In CoL, validity means being always computable. More generally, classical logic tells us when the truth of a given statement always follows from the truth of a given set of other statements. Similarly, CoL tells us when the computability of a given problem &quot;A&quot; always follows from the computability of other given problems &quot;B1...,Bn&quot;. Moreover, it provides a uniform way to actually construct a solution (algorithm) for such an &quot;A&quot; from any known solutions of &quot;B1...,Bn&quot;.

CoL formulates computational problems in their most general—interactive—sense. CoL defines a &quot;computational problem&quot; as a game played by a machine against its environment. Such a problem is &quot;computable&quot; if there is a machine that wins the game against every possible behavior of the environment. Such a game-playing machine generalizes the Church–Turing thesis to the interactive level. The classical concept of truth turns out to be a special, zero-interactivity-degree case of computability. This makes classical logic a special fragment of CoL. Thus CoL is a conservative extension of classical logic. Computability logic is more expressive, constructive and computationally meaningful than classical logic. Besides classical logic, independence-friendly (IF) logic and certain proper extensions of linear logic and intuitionistic logic also turn out to be natural fragments of CoL. Hence meaningful concepts of &quot;intuitionistic truth&quot;, &quot;linear-logic truth&quot; and &quot;IF-logic truth&quot; can be derived from the semantics of CoL.

CoL systematically answers the fundamental question of what can be computed and how; thus CoL has many applications, such as constructive applied theories, knowledge base systems, systems for planning and action. Out of these, only applications in constructive applied theories have been extensively explored so far: a series of CoL-based number theories, termed &quot;clarithmetics&quot;, have been constructed as computationally and complexity-theoretically meaningful alternatives to the classical-logic-based first-order Peano arithmetic and its variations such as systems of bounded arithmetic.

Traditional proof systems such as natural deduction and sequent calculus are insufficient for axiomatizing nontrivial fragments of CoL. This has necessitated developing alternative, more general and flexible methods of proof, such as cirquent calculus.

==Language== 
 The full language of CoL extends the language of classical first-order logic. Its logical vocabulary has several sorts of conjunctions, disjunctions, quantifiers, implications, negations and so called recurrence operators. This collection includes all connectives and quantifiers of classical logic. The language also has two sorts of nonlogical atoms: &quot;elementary&quot; and &quot;general&quot;. Elementary atoms, which are nothing but the atoms of classical logic, represent &quot;elementary problems&quot;, i.e., games with no moves that are automatically won by the machine when true and lost when false. General atoms, on the other hand, can be interpreted as any games, elementary or non-elementary. Both semantically and syntactically, classical logic is nothing but the fragment of CoL obtained by forbidding general atoms in its language, and forbidding all operators other than ¬, ∧, ∨, →, ∀, ∃.

Japaridze has repeatedly pointed out that the language of CoL is open-ended, and may undergo further extensions. Due to the expressiveness of this language, advances in CoL, such as constructing axiomatizations or building CoL-based applied theories, have usually been limited to one or another proper fragment of the language.

==Semantics== 
The games underlying the semantics of CoL are called &quot;static games&quot;. Such games have no turn order; a player can always move while the other players are &quot;thinking&quot;. However, static games never punishes a player for &quot;thinking&quot; too long (delaying its own moves), so such games never become contests of speed. All elementary games are automatically static, and so are the games allowed to be interpretations of general atoms.

There are two players in static games: the &quot;machine&quot; and the &quot;environment&quot;. The machine can only follow algorithmic strategies, while there are no restrictions on the behavior of the environment. Each run (play) is won by one of these players and lost by the other.

The logical operators of CoL are understood as operations on games. Here we informally survey some of those operations. For simplicity we assume that the domain of discourse is always the set of all natural numbers: {0,1,2...}. 

The operation ¬ of &quot;negation&quot; (&quot;not&quot;) switches the roles of the two players, turning moves and wins by the machine into those by the environment, and vice versa. For instance, if &quot;Chess&quot; is the game of chess (but with ties ruled out) from the white player&#x27;s perspective, then ¬&quot;Chess&quot; is the same game from the black player&#x27;s perspective. 

The &quot;parallel conjunction&quot; ∧ (&quot;pand&quot;) and &quot;parallel disjunction&quot; ∨ (&quot;por&quot;) combine games in a parallel fashion. A run of &quot;A&quot;∧&quot;B&quot; or &quot;A&quot;∨&quot;B&quot; is a simultaneous play in the two conjuncts. The machine wins &quot;A&quot;∧&quot;B&quot; if it wins both of them. The machine wins &quot;A&quot;∨&quot;B&quot; if it wins at least one of them. For example, &quot;Chess&quot;∨¬&quot;Chess&quot; is a game on two boards, one played white and one black, and where the task of the machine is to win on at least one board. Such a game can be easily won regardless who the adversary is, by copying his moves from one board to the other.

The &quot;parallel implication&quot; operator → (&quot;pimplication&quot;) is defined by &quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot; = ¬&quot;A&quot;∨&quot;B&quot;. The intuitive meaning of this operation is &quot;reducing&quot; &quot;B&quot; to &quot;A&quot;, i.e., solving &quot;A&quot; as long as the adversary solves &quot;B&quot;.

The &quot;parallel quantifiers&quot; ∧ (&quot;pall&quot;) and ∨ (&quot;pexists&quot;) can be defined by ∧&quot;xA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;A&quot;(0)∧&quot;A&quot;(1)∧&quot;A&quot;(2)∧... and ∨&quot;xA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;A&quot;(0)∨&quot;A&quot;(1)∨&quot;A&quot;(2)∨... These are thus simultaneous plays of &quot;A&quot;(0),&quot;A&quot;(1),&quot;A&quot;(2)..., each on a separate board. The machine wins ∧&quot;xA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) if it wins all of these games, and ∨&quot;xA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) if it wins some.

The &quot;blind quantifiers&quot; ∀ (&quot;blall&quot;) and ∃ (&quot;blexists&quot;), on the other hand, generate single-board games. A run of ∀&quot;xA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) or ∃&quot;xA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a single run of &quot;A&quot;. The machine wins ∀&quot;xA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) (respectively ∃&quot;xA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) if such a run is a won run of &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for all (respectively at least one) possible values of &quot;x&quot;, and wins ∃&quot;xA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) if this is true for at least one. 

All of the operators characterized so far behave exactly like their classical counterparts when they are applied to elementary (moveless) games, and validate the same principles. This is why CoL uses the same symbols for those operators as classical logic does. When such operators are applied to non-elementary games, however, their behavior is no longer classical. So, for instance, if &quot;p&quot; is an elementary atom and &quot;P&quot; a general atom, &quot;p&quot;→&quot;p&quot;∧&quot;p&quot; is valid while &quot;P&quot;→&quot;P&quot;∧&quot;P&quot; is not. The principle of the excluded middle &quot;P&quot;∨¬&quot;P&quot;, however, remains valid. The same principle is invalid with all three other sorts (choice, sequential and toggling) of disjunction.

The &quot;choice disjunction&quot; ⊔ (&quot;chor&quot;) of games &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, written &quot;A&quot;⊔&quot;B&quot;, is a game where, in order to win, the machine has to choose one of the two disjuncts and then win in the chosen component. The &quot;sequential disjunction&quot; (&quot;sor&quot;) &quot;A&quot;&quot;B&quot; starts as &quot;A&quot;; it also ends as &quot;A&quot; unless the machine makes a &quot;switch&quot; move, in which case &quot;A&quot; is abandoned and the game restarts and continues as &quot;B&quot;. In the &quot;toggling disjunction&quot; (&quot;tor&quot;) &quot;A&quot;⩛&quot;B&quot;, the machine may switch between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; any finite number of times. Each disjunction operator has its dual conjunction, obtained by interchanging the roles of the two players. The corresponding quantifiers can further be defined as infinite conjunctions or disjunctions in the same way as in the case of the parallel quantifiers. Each sort of disjunction also induces a corresponding implication operation the same way as this was the case with the parallel implication →. For instance, the &quot;choice implication&quot; (&quot;chimplication&quot;) &quot;A&quot;⊐&quot;B&quot; is defined as ¬&quot;A&quot;⊔&quot;B&quot;. 

The &quot;parallel recurrence&quot; (&quot;precurrence&quot;) of &quot;A&quot; can be defined as the infinite parallel conjunction &quot;A&quot;∧A∧A∧... The sequential (&quot;srecurrence&quot;) and toggling (&quot;trecurrence&quot;) sorts of recurrences can be defined similarly.

The &quot;corecurrence&quot; operators can be defined as infinite disjunctions. &quot;Branching recurrence&quot; (&quot;brecurrence&quot;) ⫰, which is the strongest sort of recurrence, does not have a corresponding conjunction. ⫰&quot;A&quot; is a game that starts and proceeds as &quot;A&quot;. At any time, however, the environment is allowed to make a &quot;replicative&quot; move, which creates two copies of the then-current position of &quot;A&quot;, thus splitting the play into two parallel threads with a common past but possibly different future developments. In the same fashion, the environment can further replicate any of positions of any thread, thus creating more and more threads of &quot;A&quot;. Those threads are played in parallel, and the machine needs to win &quot;A&quot; in all threads to be the winner in ⫰&quot;A&quot;. &quot;Branching corecurrence&quot; (&quot;cobrecurrence&quot;) ⫯ is defined symmetrically by interchanging &quot;machine&quot; and &quot;environment&quot;. 

Each sort of recurrence further induces a corresponding weak version of implication and weak version of negation. The former is said to be a &quot;rimplication&quot;, and the latter a &quot;refutation&quot;. The &quot;branching rimplication&quot; (&quot;brimplication&quot;) &quot;A&quot;⟜&quot;B&quot; is nothing but ⫰&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;, and the &quot;branching refutation&quot; (&quot;brefutation&quot;) of &quot;A&quot; is &quot;A&quot;⟜⊥, where ⊥ is the always-lost elementary game. Similarly for all other sorts of rimplication and refutation.

==As a problem specification tool== 
The language of CoL offers a systematic way to specify an infinite variety of computational problems, with or without names established in the literature. Below are some examples. 

Let &quot;f&quot; be a unary function. The problem of computing &quot;f&quot; will be written as ⊓x⊔y(&quot;y&quot;=&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)). According to the semantics of CoL, this is a game where the first move (&quot;input&quot;) is by the environment, which should choose a value &quot;m&quot; for &quot;x&quot;. Intuitively, this amounts to asking the machine to tell the value of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;). The game continues as ⊔y(&quot;y&quot;=&quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)). Now the machine is expected to make a move (&quot;output&quot;), which should be choosing a value &quot;n&quot; for &quot;y&quot;. This amounts to saying that &quot;n&quot; is the value of &quot;f&quot;(m). The game is now brought down to the elementary &quot;n&quot;=&quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;), which is won by the machine if and only if &quot;n&quot; is indeed the value of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;). 

Let &quot;p&quot; be a unary predicate. Then ⊓&quot;x&quot;(&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)⊔¬&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) expresses the problem of deciding &quot;p&quot;, ⊓&quot;x&quot;(&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&amp;¬&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) expresses the problem of semideciding &quot;p&quot;, and ⊓&quot;x&quot;(&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)⩛¬&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) the problem of recursively approximating &quot;p&quot;. 

Let &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; be two unary predicates. Then ⊓&quot;x&quot;(&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)⊔¬&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;))⟜⊓&quot;x&quot;(&quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)⊔¬&quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) expresses the problem of Turing-reducing &quot;q&quot; to &quot;p&quot; (in the sense that &quot;q&quot; is Turing reducible to &quot;p&quot; if and only if the interactive problem ⊓&quot;x&quot;(&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)⊔¬&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;))⟜⊓&quot;x&quot;(&quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)⊔¬&quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) is computable). ⊓&quot;x&quot;(&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)⊔¬&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;))→⊓&quot;x&quot;(&quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)⊔¬&quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) does the same but for the stronger version of Turing reduction where the oracle for &quot;p&quot; can be queried only once. ⊓x⊔&quot;y&quot;(&quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)↔&quot;p&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)) does the same for the problem of many-one reducing &quot;q&quot; to &quot;p&quot;. With more complex expressions one can capture all kinds of nameless yet potentially meaningful relations and operations on computational problems, such as, for instance, &quot;Turing-reducing the problem of semideciding &quot;r&quot; to the problem of many-one reducing &quot;q&quot; to &quot;p&quot;&quot;. Imposing time or space restrictions on the work of the machine, one further gets complexity-theoretic counterparts of such relations and operations.

==As a problem solving tool== 
The known deductive systems for various fragments of CoL share the property that a solution (algorithm) can be automatically extracted from a proof of a problem in the system. This property is further inherited by all applied theories based on those systems. So, in order to find a solution for a given problem, it is sufficient to express it in the language of CoL and then find a proof of that expression. Another way to look at this phenomenon is to think of a formula &quot;G&quot; of CoL as program specification (goal). Then a proof of &quot;G&quot; is – more precisely, translates into – a program meeting that specification. There is no need to verify that the specification is met, because the proof itself is, in fact, such a verification. 

Examples of CoL-based applied theories are the so-called &quot;clarithmetics&quot;. These are number theories based on CoL in the same sense as first-order Peano arithmetic PA is based on classical logic. Such a system is usually a conservative extension of PA. It typically includes all Peano axioms, and adds to them one or two extra-Peano axioms such as ⊓&quot;x&quot;⊔&quot;y&quot;(&quot;y&quot;=&quot;x&quot;&#x27;) expressing the computability of the successor function. Typically it also has one or two non-logical rules of inference, such as constructive versions of induction or comprehension. Through routine variations in such rules one can obtain sound and complete systems characterizing one or another interactive computational complexity class &quot;C&quot;. This is in the sense that a problem belongs to &quot;C&quot; if and only if it has a proof in the theory. So, such a theory can be used for finding not merely algorithmic solutions, but also efficient ones on demand, such as solutions that run in polynomial time or logarithmic space. It should be pointed out that all clarithmetical theories share the same logical postulates, and only their non-logical postulates vary depending on the target complexity class. Their notable distinguishing feature from other approaches with similar aspirations (such as bounded arithmetic) is that they extend rather than weaken PA, preserving the full deductive power and convenience of the latter.

<text>Percy Erskine Nobbs (11 August 1875 – 5 November 1964) was a Scottish-Canadian architect who was born in Haddington, East Lothian, and trained in the United Kingdom. Educated at the Edinburgh Collegiate School and Edinburgh University, he spent most of his career in the Montreal area. Often working in partnership with George Taylor Hyde, Nobbs designed a great many of what would become Montreal&#x27;s heritage buildings and was a key Canadian proponent of the Arts and Crafts Movement in architecture. He served as the director of McGill University&#x27;s School of Architecture for ten years. He designed many buildings on the campus as well as McGill&#x27;s Coat of Arms, which continues to be used today.

==Architecture career==
He designed the fire station on Euston Road in the &quot;Arts and Crafts&quot; style. It was built in 1901-2 and still stands. Nobbs had already received awards and won prizes as a practicing architect when he came to McGill University in 1903 to teach architecture. He got permission to practice architecture while teaching and soon obtained commissions for private homes and institutional buildings. His designs for homes had the distinction of paying a great deal of attention to the siting and orientation of the building and the placement of the windows. He considered this at least as important as what the home actually looked like. He called it &quot;building for Prospect as well as Aspect,&quot; and designed many an impressive mansion in this way. The magnitude of such mansions can be grasped by studying through his various plans and blueprints, such as the house of the Quebec Alpha of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity in Montreal. The initial plans divided the house across 4 floors, 11 bedrooms, a library, and 2 servants&#x27; rooms. These documents are currently kept in the Canadian Architecture Collection of the McGill University Archives.

In partnership with Cecil Burgess, Percy Erskine Nobbs designed the J.B. Porter House on McTavish Street, Montreal, which has been demolished. In 1906-1907 Nobbs was in a temporary partnership with David Robertson Brown.

==Projects==

Nobbs designed the interior decorative program of the Currie Hall at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. The Currie Building decorations evoke the achievements of the Canadian Corps in the Great War, and with the British Monarchy.

Nobbs and Hyde designed many McGill University buildings: Power House (1909); Strathcona Medical Building (1923); Pathology Building (1923); Pulp &amp; Paper Research Institute (1927). Nobbs and Hyde remodeled many McGill University buildings: MacDonald Engineering Building, reconstruction after a fire in 1907; a major addition to the University Library, McTavish Street (1921–22); addition of West Wing at Royal Victoria College (1930–31). Nobbs and Hyde provided interiors and furniture for the Osler Memorial Library (1923). Many of his drawings for McGill University buildings can be found in his archive, held in the Canadian Architecture Collection at McGill University.

Nobbs and Hyde designed some commercial buildings around Montreal as well as the University Club building (1913) on Mansfield Street.

Nobbs and Frank Darling designed the master plan for the University of Alberta in 1909–1910. With Cecil S. Burgess, Nobbs designed the Provincial College of Medicine (1920–21). Nobbs designed the Arts Building (1914–15); laboratories and Power House (1914);

Nobbs and Hyde won the competition for the war memorial in Regina.

He designed the University Club building in Montreal, associated with McGill University, which was completed in 1913 and was eventually registered as a monument historique of Quebec. He also designed the McGill University Coat of Arms three years into his directorship at the McGill School of Architecture, which continues to be used by the university today.

==Other activities==
He was an accomplished athlete in fencing, representing Canada at the 1908 Olympics and for all of his life he was a true fisherman and founded the Atlantic Salmon Federation due to his love of fishing. He published two books, now both out of print, entitled &quot;Fencing Tactics&quot; and &quot;Salmon Tactics&quot;. His talent as a draftsman and painter—he was an RCA—was also quite exceptional.

==Honours==
He was elected an Academician of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1920 and, in 1924, became President of the Quebec Association of Architects. In 1928, he was named President of the Town Planning Institute of Canada. In 1929, he was elected to the Royal Society of Arts and also became President of the Royal Architectural Institute in Canada.

<text>Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse, (17 November 1840 – 29 August 1908) was a member of the Irish peerage and an amateur astronomer. His name is often given as Laurence Parsons.

==Biography==
He was born at Birr Castle, Parsonstown, King&#x27;s County, Ireland, the son and heir of the astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse who built the &quot;Leviathan of Parsonstown&quot; telescope, largest of its day, and his wife, the Countess of Rosse (née Mary Field), an amateur astronomer and pioneering photographer. Lawrence succeeded his father in 1867 and was educated first at home by tutors, like John Purser, and after at Trinity College Dublin and Oxford University. He was the brother of Charles Algernon Parsons, inventor of the steam turbine.

He served as Chancellor of the University of Dublin between 1885 and 1908. He was Lord Lieutenant of King&#x27;s County and Custos Rotulorum of King&#x27;s County from 1892 to his death. He was also a Justice of the Peace for the county and was appointed High Sheriff of King&#x27;s County for 1867–68. He was knighted KP in 1890.

Lord Rosse also performed some preliminary work in association with the practices of the electrodeposition of copper sulfate upon silver films circa 1865 whilst in search of the design for a truly flat mirror to use in a telescope. However, he found it impossible to properly electroplate copper upon these silver films, as the copper would contract and detach from the underlying glass substrate. His note has been cited as one of the earliest confirmations in literature that thin films on glass substrates experience residual stresses. He revived discussion in on his work &quot;Nature&quot;&#x27;s August 1908 edition after witnessing similar techniques used to present newly devised searchlights before the Royal Society.

Although overshadowed by his father (when astronomers speak of &quot;Lord Rosse&quot;, it is almost always the father that they refer to), he nonetheless pursued some astronomical observations of his own, particularly of the Moon. Most notably, he discovered NGC 2. In 1880 Otto Boeddicker, a young astronomer from Germany, became his chief assistant.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in December 1867 and delivered the Bakerian lecture there in 1873. He was vice-president of the society in 1881 and 1887. From 1896 he was President of the Royal Irish Academy. In May 1902 he was at Carnavon to receive the honorary degree LL.D. (Legum Doctor) from the University of Wales during the ceremony to install the Prince of Wales (later King George V) as Chancellor of that university.

==Marriage and children==

He married Frances Cassandra Hawke, daughter of Edward Harvey-Hawke, 4th Baron Hawke and Frances Fetherstonhaugh, on 1 September 1870. They had three children:

* William Parsons, 5th Earl of Rosse (14 June 1873 – 10 June 1918), married Frances Lois Lister-Kaye, daughter of Sir Cecil Lister-Kaye, 4th Baronet and Lady Beatrice Adeline Pelham-Clinton
* Hon. Geoffry Lawrence Parsons (24 May 1874 – 13 May 1956), married Margaret Betty Gladstone, daughter of Sir John Gladstone, 4th Baronet
* Lady Muriel Frances Mary Parsons (13 November 1876 – 10 April 1927), married Brigadier-General Harold Maxwell Grenfell, son of Pascoe du Pre Grenfell and Sophia Grenfell

<doc id="616992" wikidata="Q2589818" url="?curid=616992" title="Controlled burn">
<text>A controlled burn or prescribed burn (Rx burn) is the practice of intentionally setting a fire to change the assemblage of vegetation and decaying material in a landscape. The purpose could be for forest management, ecological restoration, land clearing or wildfire fuel management. A controlled burn may also refer to the intentional burning of slash and fuels through burn piles. Controlled burns may also be referred to as hazard reduction burning, backfire, swailing or a burn-off. In industrialized countries, controlled burning regulations and permits are usually overseen by fire control authorities.

Controlled burns are conducted during the cooler months to reduce fuel buildup and decrease the likelihood of more dangerous, hotter fires. Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some trees and reveals soil mineral layers which increases seedling vitality. In grasslands, controlled burns shift the species assemblage to primarily native grassland species. Some seeds, such as those of lodgepole pine, sequoia and many chaparral shrubs are pyriscent, meaning heat from fire causes the cone or woody husk to open and disperse seeds.

Fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and has been used by indigenous people across the world for millennia to promote biodiversity and cultivate wild crops, such as fire-stick farming by aboriginal Australians. Colonial law in North America and Australia displaced indigenous people from lands that were controlled with fire and prohibited from conducting traditional controlled burns. After wildfires began increasing in scale and intensity in the 20th century, fire control authorities began reintroducing controlled burns and indigenous leadership into land management.

==Uses==
=== Forestry ===
Controlled burning reduces fuels, improves wildlife habitat, controls competing vegetation, helps control tree disease and pests, perpetuates fire-dependent species and improves accessibility. To improve the application of prescribed burns for conservation goals, which may involve mimicking historical or natural fire regimes, scientists assess the impact of variation in fire attributes. Parameters measured are fire frequency, intensity, severity, patchiness, spatial scale and phenology.

Furthermore, controlled fire can be used for site preparation when mechanized treatments are not possible because of terrain that prevents equipment access. Species variation and competition can drastically increase a few years after fuel treatments because of the increase in soil nutrients and availability of space and sunlight.

Many trees depend on fire as a way to clear out other plant species and release their seeds. The giant sequoia, among other fire-adapted conifer species, depends on fire to reproduce. The cones are pyriscent so they will only open after exposed to a certain temperature. This reduces competition for the giant sequoia seedlings because the fire has cleared non-fire-adapted, competing species. Pyriscent species benefit from moderate-intensity fires in older stands; however, climate change is causing more frequent high intensity fires in North America. Controlled burns can manage the fire cycle and the intensity of regenerate fires in forests with pyriscent species like the boreal forest in Canada.

&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; or mountain ash of Australia also shows a unique evolution with fire, quickly replacing damaged buds or stems in the case of danger. They also carry their seeds in capsules which can be deposited at any time of the year . During a wildfire, the capsules drop nearly all of their seeds and the fire consumes the eucalypt adults, but most of the seeds survive using the ash as a source of nutrients. At their rate of growth, they quickly dominate the land and a new, like-aged eucalyptus forest grows. Other tree species like poplar can easily regenerate after a fire into a like-aged stand from a vast root system that is protected from fires because it is underground.

=== Grassland restoration ===
Native grassland species in North America and Australia are adapted to survive occasional low intensity fires. Controlled burns in prairie ecosystems mimic low intensity fires that shift the composition of plants from non-native species to native species. These controlled burns occur during the early spring before native plants begin actively growing, when soil moisture is higher and when the fuel load on the ground is low to ensure that the controlled burn remains low intensity.

=== Wildfire management ===
Controlled burns reduce the amount of understory fuel so when a wildfire enters the area, a controlled burn site can reduce the intensity of the fire or prevent the fire from crossing the area entirely. A controlled burn prior to the wildfire season can protect infrastructure and communities or mitigate risks associated with many dead standing trees such as after a pest infestation when forest fuels are high. 

=== Agriculture ===
In the developing world, the use of controlled burns in agriculture is often referred to as slash and burn. In industrialized nations, it is seen as one component of shifting cultivation, as a part of field preparation for planting. Often called field burning, this technique is used to clear the land of any existing crop residue as well as kill weeds and weed seeds. Field burning is less expensive than most other methods such as herbicides or tillage, but because it produces smoke and other fire-related pollutants, its use is not popular in agricultural areas bounded by residential housing.

Prescribed fires are broadly used in the context of woody plant encroachment, with the aim of improving the balance of woody plants and grasses in shrublands and grasslands.

In Northern-India, especially in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, unregulated burning of agricultural waste is a major problem. Smoke from these fires leads to degradation in environmental quality in these states and the surrounded area.

In East Africa, bird densities increased months after controlled burning had occurred.

=== Greenhouse gas abatement ===
Controlled burns on Australian savannas can result in a long-term cumulative reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. One working example is the West Arnhem Fire Management Agreement, started to bring &quot;strategic fire management across of Western Arnhem Land&quot; to partially offset greenhouse gas emissions from a liquefied natural gas plant in Darwin, Australia. Deliberately starting controlled burns early in the dry season results in a mosaic of burnt and unburnt country which reduces the area of stronger, late dry season fires;&lt;ref name=&quot;savanna.cdu.edu.au/arnhem_fire_proj&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; it is also known as &quot;patch burning&quot;.

== Procedure ==
Health and safety, protecting personnel, preventing the fire from escaping and reducing the impact of smoke are the most important considerations when planning a controlled burn. While the most common driver of fuel treatment is the prevention of loss of human life and structures, certain parameters can also be changed to promote biodiversity and to rearrange the age of a stand or the assemblage of species.

To minimize the impact of smoke, burning should be restricted to daylight hours whenever possible. Furthermore, in temperate climates, it is important to burn grasslands and prairies before native species begin growing for the season so that only non-native species, which send up shoots earlier in the spring, are affected by the fire.

=== Ground ignition ===

Back burning or a back fire is the term given to the process of lighting vegetation in such a way that it has to burn against the prevailing wind. This produces a slower moving and more controllable fire. Controlled burns utilize back burning during planned fire events to create a &quot;black line&quot; where fire cannot burn through. Back burning or backfiring is also done to stop a wildfire that is already in progress. Firebreaks are also used as an anchor point to start a line of fires along natural or man-made features such as a river, road or a bulldozed clearing.

Head fires, that burn with the prevailing wind, are used between two firebreaks because head fires will burn more intensely and move faster than a back burn. Head fires are used when a back burn would move too slowly through the fuel either because the fuel moisture is high or the wind speed is low. Another method to increase the speed of a back burn is to use a flank fire which is lit at right angles to the prevailing wind and spreads in the same direction.

==== Grassland or prairie burning ====

In Ontario, Canada, controlled burns are regulated by the Ministry of Natural Resources and only trained personnel can plan and ignite controlled burns within Ontario&#x27;s fire regions or if the Ministry of Natural Resources in involved in any aspect of planning a controlled burn. The team performing the prescribed burn is divided into several roles; the Burn Boss, Communications, Suppression and Ignition. The planning process begins by submitting an application to a local fire management office and after approval, applicants must submit a burn plan several weeks prior to ignition.

On the day of the controlled burn, personnel meet with the Burn Boss and discuss the tactics being used for ignition and suppression, health and safety precautions, fuel moisture levels and the weather (wind direction, wind speed, temperature and precipitation) for the day. On site, local fire control authorities are notified by telephone about the controlled burn while the rest of the team members fill drip torches with pre-mixed fuel, fill suppression packs with water and put up barricades and signage to prevent pedestrian access to the controlled burn. Driptorches are canisters filled with fuel and a wick at the end that is used to ignite the lines of fire. Safe zones are established to ensure personnel know where the fire cannot cross either because of natural barriers like bodies of water or human-made barriers like tilled earth. During ignition, the Burn Boss relays information about the fire (flame length, flame height, the percent of ground that has been blackened) to the Communications Officer who documents this information. The Communications Officer relays information about the wind speed and wind direction so the Burn Boss can determine how the direction of both flames and smoke and plan their lines of fire accordingly. Once the ignition phase has ended in a section, the suppression team &quot;mops up&quot; by using suppression packs to suppress smoldering material. Other tools used for suppression are RTVs equipped with a water tank and a pump and hose that is installed in a nearby body of water. Finally, once the mop up has finished, the Burn Boss declares the controlled burn over and local fire authorities are notified.

==== Slash pile burning ====
There are several different methods used to burn piles of slash from forestry operations. Broadcast burning is the burning of scattered slash over a wide area. Pile burning is gathering up the slash into piles before burning. These burning piles may be referred to as bonfires. High temperatures can harm the soil, damaging it physically, chemically or sterilizing it. Broadcast burns tend to have lower temperatures and will not harm the soil as much as pile burning, though steps can be taken to treat the soil after a burn. In lop and scatter burning, slash is left to compact over time, or is compacted with machinery. This produces a lower intensity fire, as long as the slash is not packed too tightly.

The risk of fatal fires that stem from burning slash can also be reduced by proactively reducing ground fuels before they can create a fuel ladder and begin an active crown fire. Predictions show thinned forests lead to a reduction in fire intensity and flame lengths of forest fires compared to untouched or fire-proofed areas.

===Aerial ignition===
Aerial ignition is a type of controlled burn where incendiary devices are released from aircraft.

==History==

There are two basic causes of wildfires. One is natural, mainly through lightning, and the other is human activity. Controlled burns have a long history in wildland management. Fire has been used by humans to clear land since the Neolithic period. Fire history studies have documented regular wildland fires ignited by indigenous peoples in North America and Australia prior to the establishment of colonial law and fire suppression. Native Americans frequently used fire to manage natural environments in a way that benefited humans and wildlife in forests and grasslands by starting low-intensity fires that released nutrients for plants, reduced competition for cultivated species, and consumed excess flammable material that otherwise would eventually fuel high-intensity, catastrophic fires.

=== North America ===
The use of controlled burns in North America ended in the early 20th century, when federal fire policies were enacted with the goal of suppressing all fires. Since 1995, the US Forest Service has slowly incorporated burning practices into its forest management policies.

Fire suppression has changed the composition and ecology of North American habitats, including highly fire-dependent ecosystems such as oak savannas and canebrakes, which are now critically endangered habitats on the brink of extinction. In the Eastern United States, fire-sensitive trees such as the red maple are increasing in number, at the expense of fire-tolerant species like oaks.

==== Canada ====
In the Anishinaabeg Nation around the Great Lakes, fire is a living being that has the power to change landscapes through both destruction and the regrowth and return of life following a fire. Human beings are also inexorably tied to the land they live on as stewards who maintain the ecosystems around them. Because fire can reveal dormant seedlings, it is a land management tool. Fire was a part of the landscapes of Ontario until early colonial rule restricted indigenous culture in across Canada. During colonization, large scale forest fires were caused by sparks from railroads and fire was used to clear land for agriculture use. The public perception of forest fires was positive because the cleared land represented taming the wilderness to an urban populace. The conservation movement, which was spearheaded by Edmund Zavitz in Ontario, caused a ban on all fires, both natural wild fires and intentional fires.

In the 1970s, Parks Canada began implementing small prescribed burns however, the scale of wildfires each year outpaces the acreage of land that is intentionally burnt. In the late 1980s, the Ministry of Natural Resources in Ontario began conducting prescribed burns on forested land which led to the created of a prescribed burn program as well as training and regulation for controlled burns in Ontario.

In British Columbia, there was an increase in the intensity and scale of wildfires after local bylaws restricted the use of controlled burns. In 2017, following one of the worst years for wildfire in the province&#x27;s history, indigenous leadership and public service members wrote an independent report that suggested returning to the traditional use of prescribed burns to manage understory fuel from wildfires. The government of British Columbia responded by committing to using controlled burns as a wildfire management tool.

==== United States ====
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality began requiring a permit for farmers to burn their fields in 1981, but the requirements became stricter in 1988 following a multi-car collision in which smoke from field burning near Albany, Oregon, obscured the vision of drivers on Interstate 5, leading to a 23-car collision in which 7 people died and 37 were injured. This resulted in more scrutiny of field burning and proposals to ban field burning in the state altogether.

With controlled burns, there is also a risk that the fires get out of control. For example, the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire, the largest wildfire in the history of New Mexico, was started by two distinct instances of controlled burns, which had both been set by the US Forest Service, getting out of control and merging.

The conflict of controlled burn policy in the United States has roots in historical campaigns to combat wildfires and to the eventual acceptance of fire as a necessary ecological phenomenon. Following colonization of North America, the US used fire suppression laws to eradicate the indigenous practice of prescribed fire. This was done against scientific evidence that supported prescribed burns as a natural process. At the loss to the local environment, colonies utilized fire suppression in order to benefit the logging industry.

The notion of fire as a tool had somewhat evolved by the late 1970s as the National Park Service authorized and administered controlled burns. Following prescribed fire reintroduction, the Yellowstone fires of 1988 occurred, which significantly politicized fire management. The ensuing media coverage was a spectacle that was vulnerable to misinformation. Reports drastically inflated the scale of the fires which disposed politicians in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana to believe that all fires represented a loss of revenue from tourism. Paramount to the new action plans is the suppression of fires that threaten the loss of human life with leniency toward areas of historic, scientific, or special ecological interest.

There is still a debate amongst policy makers about how to deal with wildfires. Senators Ron Wyden and Mike Crapo of Oregon and Idaho have been moving to reduce the shifting of capital from fire prevention to fire suppression following the harsh fires of 2017 in both states.

Tensions around fire prevention continue to rise due to the increasing prevalence of climate change. As drought conditions worsen, North America has been facing an abundance of destructive wildfires. Since 1988, many states have made progress toward controlled burns. In 2021, California increased the number of trained personnel to perform controlled burns and created more accessibility for landowners.

=== Europe ===
In the European Union, burning crop stubble after harvest is used by farmers for plant health reasons under several restrictions in cross-compliance regulations. 

In the north of Great Britain, large areas of grouse moors are managed by burning in a practice known as muirburn. This kills trees and grasses, preventing natural succession, and generates the mosaic of ling (heather) of different ages which allows very large populations of red grouse to be reared for shooting. The peat-lands are some of the largest carbon sinks in the UK, providing an immensely important ecological service. The governments has restricted burning to the area but hunters have been continuing to set the moors ablaze, releasing a large amount of carbon into the atmosphere and destroying native habitat.

===Africa===
The Maasai ethnic group conduct traditional burning in savanna ecosystems before the rainy season to provide varied grazing land for livestock and to prevent larger fires when the grass is drier and the weather is hotter. In the past few decades, the practice of burning savanna has decreased because rain has become inadequate and unpredictable, there are more frequent occurrences of large accidental fires and Tanzanian government policies prevent burning savanna.

<doc id="616993" wikidata="Q1158891" url="?curid=616993" title="Steamroller">
<text>A steamroller (or steam roller) is a form of road roller – a type of heavy construction machinery used for leveling surfaces, such as roads or airfields – that is powered by a steam engine. The leveling/flattening action is achieved through a combination of the size and weight of the vehicle and the &quot;rolls&quot;: the smooth wheels and the large cylinder or drum fitted in place of treaded road wheels.

The majority of steam rollers are outwardly similar to traction engines as many traction engine manufacturers later produced rollers based on their existing designs, and the patents owned by certain roller manufacturers tended to influence the general arrangements used by others. The key difference between the two vehicles is that on a roller the main roll replaces the front wheels and axle that would be fitted to a traction engine, and the driving wheels are smooth-tired.

The word &quot;steamroller&quot; frequently refers to road rollers in general, regardless of the method of propulsion.

==History==

Before about 1850, the word steamroller meant a fixed machine for rolling and curving steel plates for boilers and ships.
From then on, it also meant a mobile device for flattening ground.
An early steamroller was patented by Louis Lemoine in France in 1859 and demonstrated sometime before February 1861. In Britain, a 30-ton steamroller was designed in 1863 by William Clark and partner W.F. Batho. Having failed to impress the British municipal road authorities it was transferred to Kolkata where it continued to work.

The company Aveling and Porter was the first to successfully sell the product commercially and subsequently became the largest manufacturer in Britain. In 1866 they produced a prototype roller with rollers fitted to the rear of a standard 12 nominal-horsepower-traction engine. This experimental machine was described by local papers as &#x27;the world&#x27;s first steamroller&#x27; and it caused a public spectacle.

In 1867, the steam road roller was patented and the company began production of the first practical steam roller – the new machine&#x27;s rollers were mounted at the front instead of the back and it weighed in excess of 30 tons. It was tested on the Military Road in Chatham, Star Hill in Rochester and in Hyde Park, London and the machine proved a huge success. Within a year, they were being exported around the world, including to France, India and the United States. A New York City chief engineer said of one of these, that &quot;in one day&#x27;s rolling at a cost of 10 dollars, as much work was accomplished as in two days&#x27; rolling with a 7 ton roller drawn by eight horses at a cost of 20 dollars a day.&quot; The heavier rollers were found to be hard to handle and the weight of the machines was reduced to around 10 tons.

Aveling and Porter refined their product continuously over the following decades, introducing fully steerable front rollers and compound steam engines at the 1881 Royal Agricultural Show. The move to asphalt for road construction resulted in the demand for steamrollers that could rapidly reverse so they could roll the tar while still hot. Machines that could do this were introduced in the first decade of the 20th century.

Production ended around 1950.

==Configurations==

The majority of rollers were of the same basic 3-roll configuration, gear-driven, with two large smooth wheels (rolls) at the back and a single wide roll at the front (in actuality, the wide roll usually consisted of two narrower rolls on the same axle, to make steering easier). However, there was also a distinctive variant, the &quot;tandem&quot;, which had two wide rolls, one front, one rear. Those made by Robey &amp; Co used their standard steam wagon engine and pistol boiler fitted in a girder frame with rolls and a chain drive to produce a quick-reversing roller suitable for modern road surfaces such as tarmacadam and bituminous asphalt. A number of Robey &amp; Co. tandem rollers were modified to make a further variant, the tri-tandem, which was a tandem with a third roll, mounted directly behind the rear one. Robey supplied the parts, but the modification was undertaken by Goodes of Royston. Ten tandem and two tri-tandem Robey rollers survive in preservation, and one of the tri-tandems is known to have been used to construct parts of the M1 motorway.

A variation of the basic configuration was the &quot;convertible&quot;: an engine which could be either a steam roller or a traction engine and could be changed from one form to the other in a relatively short time – &quot;i.e.&quot;, less than half a day. Convertible engines were liked by local authorities, since the same machine could be used for haulage in the winter and road-mending in the summer.

==Design features==
Although most steam roller designs are derived from traction engines, and were manufactured by the same companies, there are a number of features that set them apart.

===Wheels===
The most obvious difference is in the wheels. Traction engines were generally built with large fabricated spoked steel wheels with wide rims. Those intended for road use would have continuous solid rubber tyres bolted around the rims, to improve traction on tarmac. Engines intended for agricultural use would have a series of strakes bolted diagonally across the rims, like the tread on a modern pneumatic tractor tyre, and the wheels were typically wider to spread the load more evenly.

Steam rollers, on the other hand, had smooth rear wheels and a roller at the front. The roller consisted of a pair of adjacent wide cylinders supported at both ends. This replaced the separate wheels and axle of a traction engine.

===Smokebox===
In the conventional arrangement, the front roller is mounted centrally, forward of the chimney. In order to allow enough clearance from the boiler (and hence a larger front roll), the smokebox is extended forward substantially at the top to incorporate a support plate on which to mount the bearing for the roller assembly. This gives the distinctive, hooded look to the front of a steam roller. It also necessitates a different design of smokebox door – it has to hinge up or down, rather than opening sideways, due to the limited access available. Access to the boiler tubes for cleaning is limited and the brush usually has to be inserted through the small gap between the top of the roll and the fork.

===Special equipment===
The front and rear rolls were usually fitted with scraper bars. As the vehicle moved along, these removed any surface material that had become stuck to the roll, to prevent a build-up of material and ensure a flat finish was maintained.

Some steam rollers were fitted with a scarifier mounted on the tender box at the rear. They could be swung down to road level and used to rip up the old surface before a road was remade.

Another accessory was a tar sprayer – a bar mounted on the back of the roller. This was not a common fixture.

==Manufacturers==
Britain was a major exporter of steam rollers over the years, with the firm of Aveling and Porter probably being the most famous and the most prolific.

Many other traction engine manufacturers built steam rollers, but after Aveling and Porter, the most popular were Marshall, Sons &amp; Co., John Fowler &amp; Co., and Wallis &amp; Steevens.

In America, the was a large builder. J. I. Case made a roller variant of their farm engines, but had a small market share. Other nations had makers including the Czechs, Swiss, Swedes, Germans (notably Kemna) and Dutch which produced steam rollers.

==Usage==
In the UK, a number of companies owned fleets of steam rollers and contracted them out to local authorities. Many were still in use into the 1960s, and part of the M1 motorway was made using steam rollers. A few steam rollers were being used for road maintenance in the early 1970s, and this may go some way to explaining why diesel-powered rollers are still colloquially known as &quot;steam&quot; rollers today.

===Preservation===

Many steam rollers are preserved in working order, and can be seen in operation during special live steam festivals, where operating scale models may also be displayed. At some of the UK steam fairs and rallies, demonstrations of road building using the old techniques, tools and machines are re-enacted by &#x27;Road Gangs&#x27; in authentic dress. Steam rollers feature prominently in these demonstrations. The annual Great Dorset Steam Fair has a section dedicated to road-making machinery, including a line-up of working steam rollers.

A number of steamrollers ended their working lives in children&#x27;s playgrounds to provide something for children to play on.

==Popular culture==
Two popular American bands were named after steamrollers, Buffalo Springfield and Mannheim Steamroller. Parni Valjak (trans. &quot;Steamroller&quot;) is the name of the popular Croatian and Yugoslav rock band, and the group has used the name Steam Roller on their English language releases.

Two different steamrollers appear as prominent characters in the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; television series; George and Buster, both of whom are based on the Aveling-Barford R class design.

British steeplejack and engineering enthusiast Fred Dibnah was known as a national institution in Great Britain for the conservation of steam rollers and traction engines. The first engine he restored to working order was an Aveling &amp; Porter steam roller, registration no. DM3079. Built in 1912, it was a 10-ton slide-valve, single-cylinder, 4-shaft, road roller. Originally named &quot;Allison&quot;, after his first wife, Fred renamed the engine &quot;Betsy&quot; (his mother&#x27;s name) following his divorce – Fred&#x27;s view being &quot;wives may change but your mother remains your mother!&quot; This roller was featured in many of Fred&#x27;s early television programmes. It may still be seen at steam rallies in Britain and was in steam at the Great Dorset Steam Fair in 2011.

Author Terry Pratchett instructed his collaborator Neil Gaiman that anything Pratchett had been working on at the time of his death should be destroyed by a steamroller. Pratchett&#x27;s daughter and literary executor Rhianna Pratchett also stated that she had no desire to try to finish her father&#x27;s work or continue the &quot;Discworld&quot; franchise without him. Accordingly, Pratchett&#x27;s assistant Rob Wilkins brought Pratchett&#x27;s computer hard drive to the Great Dorset Steam Fair, where a steamroller was driven over it.

==As a symbol==
The steamroller has a strong symbolism of an irresistible, onward-pushing force. The Imperial Russian Army was nicknamed &quot;steamroller&quot; during World War One, as it was huge in size, and Russia initiated the war with an offensive. The &quot;Russian Steamroller&quot; is one of the personifications of Russia, along with the Russian bear, double-headed eagle and Mat Zemlya.

<doc id="617003" wikidata="Q788461" url="?curid=617003" title="Autoradiograph">
<text>An autoradiograph is an image on an X-ray film or nuclear emulsion produced by the pattern of decay emissions (e.g., beta particles or gamma rays) from a distribution of a radioactive substance. Alternatively, the autoradiograph is also available as a digital image (digital autoradiography), due to the recent development of scintillation gas detectors or rare-earth phosphorimaging systems. The film or emulsion is apposed to the labeled tissue section to obtain the autoradiograph (also called an autoradiogram). The &quot;auto-&quot; prefix indicates that the radioactive substance is within the sample, as distinguished from the case of historadiography or microradiography, in which the sample is marked using an external source. Some autoradiographs can be examined microscopically for localization of silver grains (such as on the interiors or exteriors of cells or organelles) in which the process is termed micro-autoradiography. For example, micro-autoradiography was used to examine whether atrazine was being metabolized by the hornwort plant or by epiphytic microorganisms in the biofilm layer surrounding the plant.

==Applications==
In biology, this technique may be used to determine the tissue (or cell) localization of a radioactive substance, either introduced into a metabolic pathway, bound to a receptor or enzyme, or hybridized to a nucleic acid. Applications for autoradiography are broad, ranging from biomedical to environmental sciences to industry.

=== Receptor autoradiography ===
The use of radiolabeled ligands to determine the tissue distributions of receptors is termed either &quot;in vivo&quot; or &quot;in vitro&quot; receptor autoradiography if the ligand is administered into the circulation (with subsequent tissue removal and sectioning) or applied to the tissue sections, respectively. Once the receptor density is known, &quot;in vitro&quot; autoradiography can also be used to determine the anatomical distribution and affinity of a radiolabeled drug towards the receptor. For &quot;in vitro&quot; autoradiography, radioligand was directly applying on frozen tissue sections without administration to the subject. Thus it cannot follow the distribution, metabolism and degradation situation completely in the living body. But because target in the cryosections is widely exposed and can direct contact with radioligand, &quot;in vitro&quot; autoradiography is still a quick and easy method to screen drug candidates, PET and SPECT ligands. The ligands are generally labeled with 3H (tritium), 18F (fluorine), 11C (carbon) or 125I (radioiodine). Compare to &quot;in vitro&quot;, &quot;ex vivo&quot; autoradiography were performed after administration of radioligand in the body, which can decrease the artifacts and are closer to the inner environment.

The distribution of RNA transcripts in tissue sections by the use of radiolabeled, complementary oligonucleotides or ribonucleic acids (&quot;riboprobes&quot;) is called in situ hybridization histochemistry. Radioactive precursors of DNA and RNA, [3H]-thymidine and [3H]-uridine respectively, may be introduced to living cells to determine the timing of several phases of the cell cycle. RNA or DNA viral sequences can also be located in this fashion. These probes are usually labeled with 32P, 33P, or 35S. In the realm of behavioral endocrinology, autoradiography can be used to determine hormonal uptake and indicate receptor location; an animal can be injected with a radiolabeled hormone, or the study can be conducted &quot;in vitro&quot;.

===Rate of DNA replication===

The rate of DNA replication in a mouse cell growing &quot;in vitro&quot; was measured by autoradiography as 33 nucleotides per second. The rate of phage T4 DNA elongation in phage-infected &quot;E. coli&quot; was also measured by autoradiography as 749 nucleotides per second during the period of exponential DNA increase at .

===Detection of protein phosphorylation===

Phosphorylation means the posttranslational addition of a phosphate group to specific amino acids of proteins, and such modification can lead to a drastic change in the stability or the function of a protein in the cell. Protein phosphorylation can be detected on an autoradiograph, after incubating the protein in vitro with the appropriate kinase and γ-32P-ATP. The radiolabeled phosphate of latter is incorporated into the protein which is isolated via SDS-PAGE and visualized on an autoradiograph of the gel. (See figure 3. of a recent study showing that CREB-binding protein is phosphorylated by HIPK2.)

=== Detection of sugar movement in plant tissue ===
In plant physiology, autoradiography can be used to determine sugar accumulation in leaf tissue. Sugar accumulation, as it relates to autoradiography, can described the phloem-loading strategy used in a plant. For example, if sugars accumulate in the minor veins of a leaf, it is expected that the leaves have few plasmodesmatal connections which is indicative of apoplastic movement, or an active phloem-loading strategy. Sugars, such as sucrose, fructose, or mannitol, are radiolabeled with 14-C], and then absorbed into leaf tissue by simple diffusion. The leaf tissue is then exposed to autoradiographic film (or emulsion) to produce an image. Images will show distinct vein patterns if sugar accumulation is concentrated in leaf veins (apoplastic movement), or images will show a static-like pattern if sugar accumulation is uniform throughout the leaf (symplastic movement).

===Other techniques===

This autoradiographic approach contrasts to techniques such as PET and SPECT where the exact 3-dimensional localization of the radiation source is provided by careful use of coincidence counting, gamma counters and other devices.

Krypton-85 is used to inspect aircraft components for small defects. Krypton-85 is allowed to penetrate small cracks, and then its 
presence is detected by autoradiography. The method is called &quot;krypton gas penetrant imaging&quot;. The gas penetrates smaller openings than the liquids used in dye penetrant inspection and fluorescent penetrant inspection.

== Historical events ==
The task of radioactive decontamination following the &quot;Baker&quot; nuclear test at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads in 1946 was far more difficult than the U.S. Navy had prepared for. Though the task&#x27;s futility became apparent and the danger to cleanup crews mounted, Colonel Stafford Warren, in charge of radiation safety, had difficulty persuading Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy to abandon the cleanup and with it the surviving target ships. On August 10, Warren showed Blandy an autoradiograph made by a surgeonfish from the lagoon that was left on a photographic plate overnight. The film was exposed by alpha radiation produced from the fish&#x27;s scales, evidence that plutonium, mimicking calcium, had been distributed throughout the fish. Blandy promptly ordered that all further decontamination work be discontinued. Warren wrote home, &quot;A self X ray of a fish ... did the trick.&quot;

<text>Laser hair removal is the process of hair removal by means of exposure to pulses of laser light that destroy the hair follicle. It had been performed experimentally for about twenty years before becoming commercially available in 1995–1996. One of the first published articles describing laser hair removal was authored by the group at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1998. Laser hair removal is widely practiced in clinics, and even in homes using devices designed and priced for consumer self-treatment. Many reviews of laser hair removal methods, safety, and efficacy have been published in the dermatology literature.
R. Rox Anderson and Melanie Grossman discovered that it was possible to selectively target a specific chromophore with a laser to partially damage basal stem cells inside the hair follicles. This method proved to be successful, and was first applied in 1996. In 1997, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved this tactic of hair removal. As this technology continued to be researched, laser hair removal became more effective and efficient; thus, it is now a common method in removing hair for long periods of time.

==Procedure==

The primary principle behind laser hair removal is &quot;selective photothermolysis&quot; (SPTL), the matching of a specific wavelength of light and pulse duration to obtain optimal effect on a targeted tissue with minimal effect on surrounding tissue. Lasers can cause localized damage by selectively heating dark target matter, melanin, thereby heating up the basal stem cells in the follicle which causes hair growth, the hair follicle, while not directly heating the rest of the skin. Light is absorbed by dark objects but reflected by light objects and water, so laser energy can be absorbed by dark material in the hair or skin, with much more speed and intensity than just the skin without any dark adult hair or melanin.

Melanin is considered the primary chromophore for all hair removal lasers currently on the market. Melanin occurs naturally in the skin and gives skin and hair their color. There are two types of melanin in hair. Eumelanin gives hair brown or black color, while pheomelanin gives hair blonde or red color. Because of the selective absorption of photons of laser light, only hair with color such as black, brown, or reddish-brown hair or dirty blonde can be removed. White hair, light blonde and strawberry blonde hair does not respond well. Laser works best with dark coarse hair. Light skin and dark hair are an ideal combination, being most effective and producing the best results, but lasers such as the are able to target black hair in patients with dark skin with some success. 


Hair removal lasers have been in use since 1997 and have been approved for &quot;permanent hair reduction&quot; in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Under the FDA&#x27;s definition, &quot;permanent&quot; hair reduction is the long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing after a treatment regime. Many patients experience complete regrowth of hair on their treated areas in the years following their last treatment. This means that although laser treatments with these devices will permanently reduce the total number of body hairs, they will not result in a permanent removal of all hair.

Laser hair removal has become popular because of its speed and efficacy, although some of the efficacy is dependent upon the skill and experience of the laser operator, and the choice and availability of different laser technologies used for the procedure. Some will need touch-up treatments, especially on large areas, after the initial set of 3–8 treatments.

== Comparisons with other removal techniques ==

=== Intense pulsed light ===
IPL, though technically not containing a laser, is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;laser hair removal&quot;. IPL-based methods, sometimes called &quot;phototricholysis&quot; or &quot;photoepilation&quot;, use xenon flash lamps that emit full spectrum light. IPL systems typically output wavelengths between 400 nm and 1200 nm. Filters are applied to block shorter wavelengths, thereby only using the longer, &quot;redder&quot; wavelengths. IPLs offer certain advantages over laser, principally in the pulse duration. While lasers may output trains of short pulses to simulate a longer pulse, IPL systems can generate pulse widths up to 250 ms, which is useful for larger diameter targets. Some current IPL systems have proven to be more successful in the removal of hair and blood vessels than many lasers.

A 2006 review article in the journal &quot;Lasers in Medical Science&quot; compared intense pulsed light (IPL), and both alexandrite and diode lasers. The review found no statistical difference in short-term effectiveness, but a higher incidence of side effects with diode laser-based treatment. Hair reduction after six months was reported as 68.75% for alexandrite lasers, 71.71% for diode lasers, and 66.96% for IPL. Side effects were reported as 9.5% for alexandrite lasers, 28.9% for diode lasers, and 15.3% for IPL. All side effects were found to be temporary and even pigmentation changes returned to normal within six months.

=== Electrolysis ===
Electrolysis is another hair removal method that has been used for over 135 years. Like newer laser technology used properly and with several treatments, electrolysis can be used to remove 100% of the hair from an area and is effective on hair of all colors, if used at an adequate power level with proper technique. But the treatment is slow and tedious compared with typical newer laser hair removal. More hair may grow in certain areas that are prone to hormone-induced growth (e.g. a woman&#x27;s chin and neck) based on individual hormone levels or changes therein, and one&#x27;s genetic predisposition to grow new hair.

A study conducted in 2000 at the ASVAK Laser Center in Ankara, Turkey, comparing alexandrite laser and electrolysis for hair removal on 12 patients concluded that laser hair removal was 60 times faster, less painful and more reliable than electrolysis. The type of electrolysis performed in the study was galvanic electrolysis, rather than thermolysis or a blend of the two. Galvanic current requires 30 seconds to more than a minute to release each hair whereas thermolysis or a blend can require much less. This study thus did not test the capability of all forms of modern electrolysis.

=== Shaving ===
Shaving is a technique in which one removes hair from the skin with a razor. Shaving, however, is only temporary and can lead to irritation of the shaved area.

=== Waxing ===
Waxing is another option for hair removal. This method is an efficient way of removing hair; it is longer-lasting than shaving but not permanent. The ancient Egyptians developed a similar mechanism, sugaring, in which one would mix oil and honey then apply it to the skin.

==Regulation==
In some countries, including the U.S., hair removal is an unregulated procedure that anyone can do. In some places, only doctors and doctor-supervised personnel can do it, while in other cases permission extends to licensed professionals, such as regular nurses, physician assistants, estheticians, and/or cosmetologists.

In Florida, the use of lasers, laser-like devices and intense pulsed light devices is considered medicine, and requires they be used only by a physician (M.D. or D.O.), a physician assistant under the supervision of a physician, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner under a protocol signed by a physician. An electrologist working under the direct supervision and responsibility of a physician is also allowed to perform laser hair removal in the state of Florida.

==Types==

Several wavelengths of laser energy have been used for hair removal, from visible light to near-infrared radiation. These lasers are characterized by their wavelength, measured in nanometers (nm):
Pulse width (or duration) is one of the most important considerations. The length of the heating pulse relates directly to the damage achieved in the follicle. When attempting to destroy hair follicles the main target is the germ cells which live on the surface of the hair shaft. Light energy is absorbed by the melanin within the hair and heat is generated. The heat then conducts out towards the germ cells. As long as a sufficient temperature is maintained for the required time then these cells will be successfully destroyed. This is absolutely critical – attaining the required temperature is not sufficient unless it is kept at that temperature for the corresponding time. This is determined by the Arrhenius Rate Equation. To achieve these conditions the laser/IPL system must be able to generate the required power output. The main reason why hair removal fails is simply because the equipment cannot generate the desired temperature for the correct time.

Spot size, or the width of the laser beam, directly affects the depth of penetration of the light energy due to scattering effects in the dermal layer. Larger beam diameters or those devices that has a linear scanning results in deeper deposition of energy and hence can induce higher temperatures in deeper follicles. Hair removal lasers have a spot size about the size of a fingertip (3–18 mm).

Fluence or energy density is another important consideration. Fluence is measured in joules per square centimeter (J/cm2). It&#x27;s important to get treated at high enough settings to heat up the follicles enough to disable them from producing hair.

Epidermal cooling has been determined to allow higher fluences and reduce pain and side effects, especially in darker skin. Three types of cooling have been developed:

*Contact cooling: through a window cooled by circulating water or other internal coolant. This type of cooling is by far the most efficient method of keeping the epidermis protected since it provides a constant heat sink at the skin surface. Sapphire windows are much more conductive than quartz.
*Cryogen spray: sprayed directly onto the skin immediately before and/or after the laser pulse
*Air cooling: forced cold air at -34 °C

In essence, the important output parameter when treating hair (and other skin conditions) is power density – this is a combination of energy, spot diameter and pulse duration. These three parameters determine what actually happens when the light energy is absorbed by the tissue chromophore be it melanin, hemoglobin or water, with the amount of tissue damaged being determined by the temperature/time combination.

==Number of sessions==
Hair grows in several phases (anagen, telogen, catagen) and a laser can only affect the currently active growing hair follicles (early anagen). Hence, several sessions are needed to damage the hair in all phases of growth and force it to revert to a vellus non-colored small hair.

Multiple treatments depending on the type of hair and skin color have been shown to provide long-term reduction of hair. Most people need a minimum of eight treatments. Current parameters differ from device to device but manufacturers and clinicians generally recommend waiting from three to eight weeks between sessions, depending on the area being treated. The number of sessions depends on various parameters, including the area of the body being treated, skin color, coarseness of hair, reason for hirsutism, and sex. Certain areas (notably men&#x27;s facial hair) may require considerably more treatments to achieve desired results.

Laser does not work well on light-colored hair, red hair, grey hair, white hair, as well as fine hair of any color, such as vellus. For darker skinned patients with black hair, the long-pulsed with a cooling tip can be safe and effective when used by an experienced practitioner.

Typically the shedding of the treated hairs takes about two to three weeks. These hairs should be allowed to fall out on their own and should not be manipulated by the patient for certain reasons, chiefly to avoid infections. Pulling hairs after a session can be more painful as well as counteract the effects of the treatment.

==Side effects and risks==

Some normal side effects may occur after laser hair removal treatments, including itching, pink skin, redness, and swelling around the treatment area or swelling of the follicles (follicular edema). These side effects rarely last more than two or three days. The two most common serious side effects are acne and skin discoloration.

Some level of pain should also be expected during treatments. Numbing creams are available at most clinics, sometimes for an additional cost. Some numbing creams are available over the counter. Use of strong numbing creams over large skin areas being treated at one time must be avoided, since it can cause serious harm, and even death. Typically, the cream is applied about 30 minutes before the procedure. Icing the area after the treatment helps relieve the side effects faster. Ibrahimi and Kilmer reported a study of a novel device of diode handpiece with a large spot size which used vacuum-assisted suction to reduce the level of pain associated with laser treatment.

Unwanted side effects such as hypo- or hyper-pigmentation or, in extreme cases, burning of the skin call for an adjustment in laser selection or settings. Risks include the chance of burning the skin or discoloration of the skin, hypopigmentation (white spots), flare of acne, swelling around the hair follicle (considered a normal reaction), scab formation, purpura, and infection. These risks can be reduced by treatment with an appropriate laser type used at appropriate settings for the individual&#x27;s skin type and treatment area.

Some patients may show side effects from an allergy to either the hair removal gel used with certain laser types or to a numbing cream, or to simply shaving the area too soon after the treatment.

<text>Armin Otto Leuschner (January 16, 1868 – April 22, 1953) was an American astronomer and educator.

== Early life and education==

Leuschner was born on January 16, 1868, in Detroit, Michigan, but raised in Germany. He returned to the United States for university studies, graduating from the University of Michigan in 1888 with a degree in mathematics. Leuschner then became the first graduate student at Lick Observatory, but due to conflicts with his advisor, Lick director Edward S. Holden, he left Lick before finishing his Ph.D. Leuschner subsequently returned to Germany and attended the University of Berlin, where in 1897 he earned his doctorate with a highly praised thesis on the orbits of comets.
==Career==
Leuschner returned to California as an associate professor in astronomy at University of California, Berkeley, where he remained for over half a century. He founded an observatory there for student instruction, later renamed in his honor Leuschner Observatory. Together with Lick director James E. Keeler, Leuschner shaped the combined graduate program at Berkeley and Lick into one of the nation&#x27;s foremost centers of astronomical education. Leuschner&#x27;s own research continued to focus on the orbits of asteroids and comets; this subject required tremendous amounts of detailed computation, which made the work well-suited to be shared with a long series of students, many of whom went on to successful astronomical careers of their own. More than sixty students received their doctorate under Leuschner&#x27;s guidance.

In 1913, Leuschner became dean of the entire Graduate School at Berkeley, and later was appointed head of all World War I related training at the university. 

He was a founding member of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, served a term as the president of the American Association of University Professors, and chaired the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s committee on comets and minor planets for two decades.

Leuschner was one of the first astronomers to dispute Pluto as being Planet X as predicted by Lowell. By 1932 he was already suggesting that Pluto had a mass less than the Earth, and that the discovery of Pluto was an accidental by-product of the Lowell search.

<text>Michael Francis Rowland (September 12, 1963 – February 9, 2004) was an American jockey. He was born in Saratoga Springs, New York.

During his career, Rowland won 3,997 races.

Rowland died at University Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio from head injuries suffered during a race on February 4 at Turfway Park, when his mount broke down and collapsed. Two other jockeys were injured. He was placed on life support, but never regained consciousness.

Turfway Park established the Michael F. Rowland Fund, as well as the Michael F. Rowland Award to honor the jockey who best exemplifies Rowland&#x27;s work ethic, professionalism, and perseverance. The inaugural award recipient was Luis Antonio Gonzalez, a jockey based at Thistledown Racecourse near Cleveland. Thistledown racecourse also started a memorial fund for the Rowland family.

In 2006, Rowland was posthumously inducted into the Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>John Stenhouse (21 October 1809 – 31 December 1880) was a British chemist. In 1854, he invented one of the first practical respirators.

He was a co-founder of the Chemical Society in 1841.

==Life==

John Stenhouse was born in Barrhead in Glasgow on 21 October 1809. He was the eldest son of William Stenhouse, a calico-printer in the family firm of John Stenhouse &amp; Co of 302 High Street, Glasgow, and Elizabeth Currie; he was the only one of their children to survive beyond infancy.

After education at the Glasgow Grammar School, he studied at the University of Glasgow from 1824 to 1828. Initially he intended to pursue a career in literature, but later his interests switched to chemistry, which he studied first under Professor Thomas Graham at the university and then under Dr. Thomas Thomson at Anderson&#x27;s University in Glasgow (now part of the University of Strathclyde, one of whose buildings is named after him). During 1837–1839, he attended the chemical lectures at Glasgow University, whence he left to pursue chemistry research for two years under Justus Liebig at the University of Giessen in Germany. He then returned to Glasgow. In 1841 he was a co-founder of the Chemical Society of London. In 1848 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He received an honorary doctorate (LLD) from the University of Aberdeen in 1850.

In his early years Stenhouse had been living on a fortune that had been left to him in his father&#x27;s will. However, in 1850 the Glasgow Commercial Exchange Company failed and his inheritance was lost. He then sought a professorship at Owens College, now the University of Manchester, but was unsuccessful. However, in February 1851 he was appointed Lecturer on Chemistry to the medical school at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. (August Kekulé (1829-1896), who would become an eminent organic chemist, was one of his laboratory assistants during this time.) In 1857 Stenhouse suffered a stroke, which left him partially paralyzed and forced him to resign his position. He left England to convalesce with his mother in Nice (then still part of Italy) until her death in February 1860. In June of that year he returned to England and opened a laboratory in an outbuilding of an abandoned factory on Rodney Street, King&#x27;s Cross, London; there he supported himself by assaying, consulting, and performing other contract work. He also recommenced his researches in chemistry, even though he could not perform experiments with his own hands. He hired assistants (mainly graduates from the Royal College of Chemistry) to do the work for him. These assistants included Raphael Meldola (1849-1915), who would become an eminent organic chemist, and Charles E. Groves (1841-1920), who co-authored of many of Stenhouse&#x27;s papers, which ultimately numbered in excess of 100.

From 1865 to 1870 he was an assayer to the Royal Mint (where his former professor Thomas Graham was Master of the Mint). In 1871 he received the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his chemical researches. In 1877 he became a Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry. He died a natural death on 31 December 1880, age 72, at his home in Pentonville, Islington, London and was buried in the &quot;New Cemetery&quot; of Glasgow Cathedral now partly absorbed by a car park (north of the cathedral).

==Discoveries==
Stenhouse focused on organic chemistry, particularly the chemical products of plants—and the derivatives that could be made from those products—which were of medical or commercial value; e.g., Stenhouse discovered betorcinol, a homologue of orcinol, and erythritol, both of which are found in lichens. He also discovered lead trinitro-orcinate now commonly used in non-corrosive priming compositions, even though this application was only developed decades after his death.

He was the author of many ingenious and useful inventions in dyeing (patents 13 Oct 1855 and 12 June 1856), waterproofing (patents 8 Jan 1861 and 21 Jan 1862), sugar manufacture, and tanning; but he will always be known for his application of the absorbent properties of wood charcoal to disinfecting and deodorising purposes in the form of charcoal air-filters and charcoal respirators, which have proved of great value (patents 19 July 1860 and 21 May 1867). Among other patents which he took out was one for the manufacture of glue (7 May 1857) and another for the manufacture or preparation of materials for sizing or dressing yarns and textile fabrics (29 April 1868).

<text>Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey, England. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes&#x27; walk from the town&#x27;s high street. It is down the line from .

==Services==
Services at Epsom are operated by Southern and South Western Railway.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 
* 3 tph to of which 1 continues to 
* 1 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours.

On Saturday evenings (after approximately 18:45) and on Sundays, there is no service south of Dorking to Horsham.


==History==

The railway first reached the town in 1847 when an extension of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) from West Croydon was opened with a terminus in the former Station Road (now Upper High Street). This station was initially named Epsom, subsequently renamed Epsom Town.

In 1859 a joint venture between the LBSCR and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) extended the LSWR from Wimbledon to Epsom, where it joined with the LBSCR, and then ran on to Leatherhead. The lines were connected south of the LBSCR station and a new Epsom station was established on the present site. However competition between the companies remained and the new station was operated by the LSWR only, with the tracks configured so that LBSCR trains ran non-stop on the central tracks.

In 1867 the line was extended south from Leatherhead to Dorking and Horsham, and in 1885 a branch from Leatherhead was built to Effingham Junction, where it connected to the line from Surbiton to Guildford. These extensions provided greater connections for Epsom to much of the rest of Surrey.

After the First World War, the railway companies were merged into the Southern Railway, which set about removing duplication. In 1929 work was completed on building a completely new station on the site of the former LSWR station and the tracks at Epsom were rearranged so that the two island platforms provided cross-platform interchange, although as late as the 1960s there were survivals of different systems of the lines of the two former railway companies in that the semaphore signals on the up platforms to London were upper quadrant (on platform 3) for trains to Victoria and London Bridge, but were lower quadrant (on platform 4) for the Waterloo line. The former LBSCR station Epsom Town was closed in 1929, (though some of the building remains abandoned and bricked up behind modern developments on Upper High Street, visible from the line from Ewell East).

When Thameslink services started in 1988 by British Rail its secondary southern route ran to Epsom via Elephant &amp; Castle, West Croydon and Sutton, continuing to Guildford. Thameslink services to Epsom were withdrawn in 1994.

For many years the southern ends of the platforms had a large signal box above them, dating from 1929. It was not listed, and despite extensive roof repairs it was demolished in March 1992.

The Oyster Pay as you go was extended to Epsom on 25 February 2019, allowing Oyster cards and contactless cards to be used.

==Derailment Incident: 12 September 2006==
Train 2D57, the 19:09 service from London Waterloo to Effingham Junction, became derailed on the approach to Epsom at about 19:42 on Tuesday 12 September 2006. The train was formed of two four-car class 455 electric multiple units (EMUs). The leading bogie of the fourth coach was derailed towards the left as it passed over a set of trailing points on a right-hand curve at about 17 miles per hour (27 km/h). The train came to a stop partially in Epsom station, and passengers were quickly evacuated onto the platform. There were no injuries, and there was only minor damage to the train and the track.

As the train approached Epsom, the driver shut off power and reduced speed to comply
with the permanent speed restriction round the curve into the station, entering the
curve at 19.2 mph (30.9 km/h). He felt a judder, and looked back, observing blue flashes
and smoke from the rear of the train. He assumed there was a fault with the train, and
attempted to coast into the station. As the fourth coach came into his field of vision, the
driver saw that it was derailed and made an emergency brake application. The train then
stopped within five seconds.

In the report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch into the accident, the maintenance of track and points was heavily criticised. The removal of a remote rail lubricator by Network Rail was also criticised.

==Redevelopment==

Redevelopment of Epsom station began in November 2010 and was completed in July 2013.

<doc id="617018" wikidata="Q777698" url="?curid=617018" title="Breaking character">
<text>In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition) and film, breaking character occurs when an actor fails to maintain the illusion that they are the character they are supposedly portraying. This is considered unprofessional while performing in front of an audience or camera (except when the act is a deliberate breaking of the fourth wall). British English uses a slang term, corpsing, to specifically describe one of the most common ways of breaking character—when an actor loses their composure and laughs or giggles inappropriately during a scene. The British slang term is derived from an actor laughing when their character is supposed to be a corpse. From the American critical perspective, the British slang term can also carry a deeper secondary meaning: by breaking character, the actor has pulled the audience out of the dramatic work and back to reality, effectively killed the character they are attempting to portray, and figuratively turned the character into a corpse. Thus, corpsing is &quot;the worst thing&quot; that an actor can do on stage. An actor&#x27;s breaking character often results in an abandonment of a take in recorded or filmed drama.

==Famous breaks in film==
The advent of DVD players, with the use of their precise pause and slow-motion functions, has made it far easier to spot breaks in character in motion pictures, and many internet sites collect such examples.

Example:
*Catherine Schell, who found it difficult to act with Peter Sellers in &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot; and maintain her composure. Several scenes showing her laughing at his antics remain in the film.

==On television==
Examples of actors breaking character on television include:

* Lucille Ball, in a rare example of breaking character for her, was forced to break character during filming of &quot;Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower&quot;, a season 1 episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. In the climactic scene, the titular shower filled with water due to a drain malfunction, and Ball nearly drowned attempting to unplug it. Co-star Vivian Vance hastily reworked the script to allow Ball to recover her composure. Ball&#x27;s near-drowning was included in the finished episode, which was one of several from the series to lapse into the public domain.

* Many instances of breaking character have occurred on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where showrunner Lorne Michaels is known to strongly discourage character breaks:
**Christina Applegate and David Spade could not stop laughing at Chris Farley&#x27;s motivational speaker character, Matt Foley. 
**The band members in the &quot;More Cowbell&quot; sketch broke character reacting to Will Ferrell&#x27;s antics. Jimmy Fallon often broke character, which became one of his trademarks.
** Perhaps the most severe example of an entire cast breaking is the first appearance of the Debbie Downer character, where in a 2004 skit featuring Rachel Dratch, guest host Lindsay Lohan and others, Dratch eventually struggles to exclaim to exaggerated effect &quot;By the way ... I can&#x27;t have children!&quot;
** While playing NewsNation host Bobbi Moore in an April 13, 2024 &quot;SNL&quot; skit, Heidi Gardner, who has built a reputation for maintaining composure during comedy scenes, drew considerable attention for corpsing in what &quot;Vulture&quot; magazine characterized &quot;in spectacularly charming fashion&quot;.
* In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Feast of Steven&quot;, actor William Hartnell breaks character to wish the audience a merry Christmas, with actors Peter Purves and Jean Marsh also breaking character, erupting in laughter. The Christmas address was scripted, but the laughter was not. 
* On &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Jon Stewart or one of the correspondents occasionally broke character during a segment. One example was a piece on an allegation of a homosexual relationship involving the then Prince Charles and the British tabloids&#x27; shameless use of innuendo and euphemisms to spread the rumor while avoiding libelous statements. The segment had Stephen Colbert &quot;reporting&quot; from Britain and explaining, in terms laden with homoerotic imagery, that it would be journalistically irresponsible to go into detail about the story. He then peeled a banana and took a huge bite of it in imitation of fellatio, causing himself to smile and Stewart to begin giggling off screen. By the end of the segment, Colbert was laughing so hard he could barely speak.
*Tim Conway took great pleasure in pushing his Carol Burnett Show co-stars to lose composure and break out in helpless laughter – in particular, Harvey Korman, in their Dentist Sketch as well as many others. Vicki Lawrence, as Mama in one of their many &quot;The Family&quot; sketches, scored a rare turnabout on Conway (as Mickey, Ed&#x27;s (Korman) hardware-store employee), who had reduced Burnett and Van Dyke to fits of laughter in the Siamese Elephant Sketch. After Conway&#x27;s repeated interruptions during the sketch, making a bizarre story incrementally even more so, the cast attempted to resume the sketch – prompting Lawrence to break the fourth wall and ask Eunice (Carol Burnett) &quot;You sure that little asshole&#x27;s through?&quot; which brought down the cast and studio audience as well. Needless to say, the scene ended up on the cutting-room floor and is recognized as one of the best-known &quot;blooper&quot; outtakes in TV history. Asked about the scene, years later, Lawrence cryptically replied that the scene may have been an outtake, but wasn&#x27;t a blooper. She never fully elaborated afterward.

==Virtual and gaming environments==

Breaking character or corpsing is also being used more frequently to describe a participant-player who, having assumed the role of a virtual character or avatar and is acting within a virtual or gaming environment, then breaks out of that character. For example, this could be a player-character behaving inappropriately within the social-cultural environment depicted by the virtual or gaming environment or the participant-player (momentarily or entirely) leaving the character suspended and/or lifeless.

==Professional wrestling==

Breaking character is not solely limited to performances in traditional theater, television, and film; the phenomenon is not unheard of in professional wrestling, which is normally highly scripted.

== Fictional depictions of breaking character ==
In Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s opera &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, commedia dell&#x27;arte actor Canio kills his real-life wife and her lover onstage.

<text>Ernest Heinrich Wemme (1861–1914) was a German businessman and philanthropist who came to prominence in Portland, in the U.S. state of Oregon. He was an active business investor during the pioneering era of automobiles and aviation.

==Biography==
A farmer&#x27;s son born in the village of Crostau, Kingdom of Saxony, as Ernest Heinrich Wemme, he had only a grade-school education. Facing enrollment in the German army, he immigrated to the United States at 18 years of age, not intending to stay. He later said he &quot;went broke and couldn&#x27;t get away.&quot;

According to an account published in 1932 by August Wemme, his brother, Henry Wemme began his career in Portland in 1883, &quot;with a spool of thread and a needle or two as capital.&quot;

One of his ventures was as a supplier of tents and other supplies to those joining the Klondike Gold Rush. Wemme purchased canvas and cotton, having more material &quot;than all the rest of the dealers on the coast put together&quot;, just as the boom to Alaska came to an end. However, the large payments for excess materials occurred just as the USS Maine was sunk, starting the Spanish–American War. Wemme was given an order for 32,000 tents, plus &quot;an open order for hospital tents, telling me to make all I could.&quot; Instead of going bankrupt, Wemme used up his large surplus of materials and made a substantial profit.

Wemme owned the first automobile in Oregon, a Stanley Steamer bought in 1899 from what became the Locomobile Company of America. He also introduced other automobiles to the Portland area, including a Haynes-Apperson, an Oldsmobile, a Reo, and a Pierce-Arrow. He was president of the Portland Automobile Association. Each of his successive cars bore the Oregon license plate #1.

In 1906 he sold Willamette Tent &amp; Awning to Max S. Hirsch (who had worked for his relatives at the Meier &amp; Frank department store for the previous 20 years and sold his M&amp;F stock for $50,000 in order to finance the purchase of Wemme&#x27;s business. The firm became known as Hirsch-Weis and then White Stag). Wemme invested most of his wealth in downtown Portland real estate. In 1910, he was a noted advocate for building the Columbia River Highway.

In 1912, Wemme bought the Barlow Toll Road for $5,400. He built bridges and made other improvements worth $25,000, then gave it to the people of Oregon as a free highway. Wemme, Oregon, is an unincorporated area along the Mount Hood Corridor and is named after him.

He at least briefly turned his attention to aviation, becoming the Pacific Northwest agent for the biplanes by Curtiss. One of his automobile salesmen, Eugene Ely volunteered to fly Wemme&#x27;s first Curtiss biplane to Oregon. Ely crashed without serious injury, and soon went to work for Curtiss.

He developed the Overlook neighborhood in North Portland.

&quot;As for his personality, Wemme usually dressed like a poverty-stricken laborer. He seldome wore pressed clothes or had his shoes shined and he was generally unshaven. He was always mouthing an unlighted cigar, the liquid qualities of which ran down both sides of his mouth and chin. He worked like a horse and lived like a hermit.&quot; He never married.

Wemme died December 17, 1914, in Short Hills, a suburb of Los Angeles; he is buried in Riverview Cemetery in Portland, Oregon. Wemme&#x27;s brother&#x27;s book bemoans a probate dispute over &quot;an estate appraised at more than a million dollars…&quot;; the book was written to
get before the American people…the facts as how E. Henry Wemme&#x27;s will was set aside, rendered null and void, and how both heirs of his body and the E. Henry Wemme Endowment Fund (now administered by the Oregon Community Foundation) was pillaged and plundered and dissipated, and to show how and why I have been cast into prison, where I still languish at the age of sixty three… August Wemme later lived in a &quot;skid row hotel&quot; in Portland, and in an apparent bout of senility, left a suitcase filled with gold from his inheritance on a train in Chicago.

Wemme&#x27;s will, drawn and executed by Portland lawyer and friend, George W. Joseph, bequeathed half to the Christian Science Church and half to German heirs. The dispute evolved into a major political fracas, going as far as the Oregon Supreme Court; in the process, Joseph was disbarred, and also launched a strong run for Governor of Oregon, though he died shortly after earning the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination. The case ultimately went to the United States Supreme Court before the estate was divided among several heirs in the U.S. and Germany.

Ultimately, half of his estate went to &quot;found and maintain a large home for wayward girls&quot;. It is now known as the Salvation Army White Shield Home in Northwest Portland, located at . It serves pregnant teens and young mothers who are in the foster system, typically due to being from a violent or abusive family.

<doc id="617026" wikidata="Q6908243" url="?curid=617026" title="Moore Theological College">
<text>Moore Theological College, otherwise known simply as Moore College, is the theological training seminary of the Diocese of Sydney in the Anglican Church of Australia. The Anglican Archbishop of Sydney holds &quot;ex officio&quot; the presidency of the Moore Theological College Council.

The college has a strong tradition of conservative evangelical theology with an emphasis on the study of the Bible in its original languages, the use of primary sources in theology, the heritage of the Reformation and the integration of theology and ministry practice. It gives particular attention to full-time study in the context of a Christian learning community as an appropriate context for training for full-time Christian ministry, however it also offers part-time and online learning opportunities. The college trains both men and women at every level of its program. On 1 July 2021, Moore College was recognised by the Australian Government&#x27;s Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency as an Australian University College.

==Overview==
The college is one of the largest Anglican seminaries in the world, with normally around 300 full-time students in its BD and BTh programs. Over its history, it has had 13 principals and over 4000 graduates. While Anglican in foundation and governance, it has also trained Presbyterians, Baptists, Congregationalists and others who are sympathetic to the evangelical ethos and theology of the college. The college has also prepared missionaries, church planters and independent church pastors. It attracts students from around the world into its undergraduate and postgraduate programs.

While the largest group studying in its four-year full-time undergraduate program is typically those preparing for Anglican ordained ministry, Moore has also trained other Christian workers. Moore graduates also serve as school chaplains, Christian studies teachers and scripture teachers, university chaplains and staff workers, cross-cultural missionaries, social workers, community workers, hospital and nursing home/retirement village chaplains and refugee advocacy workers.

Moore College has an international reputation as the home of evangelical biblical theology. In the 1950s through to the 1970s Donald Robinson pioneered a way of seeing how the whole Bible fits together as God&#x27;s unfolding purposes. The underlying pattern of promise and fulfilment unfolds as God&#x27;s gospel promise of salvation, first for the Jews and then for all the nations, is given to Abraham, partially fulfilled in Israel&#x27;s history, and realised in the coming of the Christ. In the 1980s and 1990s these ideas were developed by Robinson&#x27;s pupil, Graeme Goldsworthy, in a series of books, &quot;Gospel and Kingdom&quot;, &quot;According to Plan&quot;, and &quot;Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture&quot;. Biblical theology in this mode has been characteristic of the work done at Moore College since Robinson&#x27;s time as vice principal.

Robinson was also influential in developing a doctrine of the church which in a distinctive way resisted the strongly ecumenical tone of the mid twentieth century. A study of the terminology and contextual associations of &#x27;church&#x27; in the Bible led Robinson to insist &#x27;church&#x27; is a gathering, either fundamentally around Christ in heaven and instantiated throughout the world in local congregations. Each congregation is the church and associations of congregations (denominations), while valuable, cannot attribute to themselves the identity and privileges of &#x27;church&#x27;. Such structures exist to support the local congregation in its life as a community of faithful men and women committed to the global gospel mission. Broughton Knox gave these conclusions added theological depth in his own studies of &#x27;fellowship&#x27; and the critical nature of &#x27;relationship&#x27;. While this perspective was sometimes decried as &#x27;congregationalism&#x27;, both men were active throughout their lives in the work of the Diocese of Sydney, and Robinson himself became a bishop and in time Archbishop of Sydney. They cannot be construed as congregationalists in any pure sense of the word. However, their teaching gave a priority to the local congregation over denominational and ecumenical concerns and located the unity of the church, something to be maintained rather than established, in the unity of the heavenly gathering around the throne of Christ.

Moore College has played a role in the shape of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney by training the vast majority of the diocese&#x27;s clergy including the last five Archbishops of Sydney, three of which were also full-time members of the college faculty. Members of the current faculty also serve in various capacities in the diocese, including its Synod, Standing Committee, the Social Issues Committee and the Sydney Diocesan Doctrine Commission.

==History==
Thomas Hobbes Scott, the first Archdeacon of New South Wales (1825–29), shared his vision for a tertiary training college in the colony in the 1830 Report of the Church and Schools Corporation. With this vision in mind, one of the early settlers of the colony of New South Wales, Thomas Moore, made provision in his will to leave a substantial portion of his considerable fortune to found a college to train young men in &#x27;the principles of the United Church of England and Ireland&#x27;. Moore died in 1840, but the vision was realised when Bishop Frederic Barker opened Moore College on 1 March 1856 in Moore&#x27;s former home in Liverpool, New South Wales. In terms of the date of opening, at least, the college is, therefore, the third oldest tertiary institution in Australia after the University of Sydney (1850) and the University of Melbourne (1853). It began with three students and one full-time tutor, the principal. For almost the first one hundred years of its life (1856–1953), the principals of the college came from the United Kingdom and Ireland. Marcus Loane was the first Australian-born principal of the college (1953–58). The current principal, Mark D. Thompson, took up office in May 2013.

After a theological controversy which, alongside a downturn in student enrollments, led to the dismissal of the principal of the day (T. E. Hill), the teaching activity of the college was suspended in 1888. It reopened in 1891, at the present site in Newtown adjacent to the University of Sydney. The college began to grow in student numbers and influence, particularly under the important principalships of Nathaniel Jones (1897–1911) and later T. C. Hammond (1935–1953). However, the college&#x27;s most notable leader in 20th century was Broughton Knox (1959-1985). His vision, drive and shrewd management of the college saw it built into a theological college with an international reputation, a noted faculty and students spreading out from Sydney to many other parts of Australia and the globe.

The site on which the college reopened in 1891 has expanded considerably since then. Numerous adjacent buildings have been acquired or built. The Broughton Knox Teaching Centre was opened in 1994. In 2017 a major new building was opened which houses, amongst other things, the Donald Robinson Library and Marcus Loane Hall.

By 1985 the Donald Robinson Library held 90,000 books and it has since grown to contain close to 300,000 works including numerous manuscripts and other items of significance to Anglican, Australian and Evangelical history. In recent years it has developed a significant body of electronic resources and a growing collection of rare books, including the Latimer Library, which was once housed in Latimer House Oxford and was acquired by the library in 2020. In the 1970s the college established its own theological bookstore, I.M.P.A.C.T. Books, which was later renamed MooreBooks. With the advent of internet books sales, Moore Books became financial unsustainable and was closed in 2012.

Well-known Moore College theologians and writers have included Broughton Knox, Donald Robinson, Paul Barnett, Peter Jensen, Graeme Goldsworthy, Peter O&#x27;Brien, David Peterson, Barry Webb, John Woodhouse, Peter Bolt, Mark D. Thompson, Andrew G. Shead, Paul R. Williamson, and Edward Loane. Through the influence of Moore College, Sydney Anglicanism has maintained its distinctive Evangelical perspective within worldwide Anglicanism.

In 2021 Moore College received approval to develop new student accommodation for 91students to replace the existing John Chapman House on the corner of City Road and Carillon Avenue in Newtown, New South Wales.

==Annual events==
In 1977 the college began to host an annual lecture series, the Annual Moore College Lectures, which have been a showcase of leading contemporary biblical and theological scholarship, and most of which have been subsequently published. International guests who have contributed to the lecture series have included J. I. Packer, F. F. Bruce, D. A. Carson, Kenneth Kantzer, Henri Blocher, Mike Ovey, Ashley Null, Gerald Bray, Michael Horton, Kevin Vanhoozer, Carl Trueman and James Hely Hutchinson. Past and present Moore College faculty have also contributed to this lecture series.

Also in the late 1970s, an annual school of theology began to be held which enabled faculty and graduates to explore subjects of interest and importance in the wider Christian community. Subjects treated have included the church, the Spirit, the ethics of life and death, biblical theology, justification, emotions in the Christian life, a celebration of the John Calvin Quincentenary (2009), the Quincentenary of the Reformation (2017), and various books of the Bible (incl. Galatians, Exodus, and the Psalms). The school still continues as a biennial School of Biblical Theology.

==Academic and practical training for Christian ministry==
When the College opened in 1856, the principal developed a curriculum which enabled the college to offer its own &#x27;college certificate&#x27;. By the end of the nineteenth century, however, the college was preparing students for the Oxford and Cambridge Preliminary Examination for Holy Orders. In 1907, students began to sit examinations leading to the University of Durham&#x27;s Licentiate of Theology. A long association with the Australian College of Theology began soon after, with students preparing for the ACT&#x27;s Licentiate in Theology examinations, and from the 1970s until 2001, its Bachelor of Theology degree. At the same time, from 1958 to 1986, around 200 students were prepared for the external Bachelor of Divinity degree of London University, tutored by the Moore College faculty. Students received the &#x27;Moore College Diploma&#x27;, an unaccredited award, for work done during the fourth year of study.

In 1992, the four-year program of study at Moore College was redesigned as an integrated package and became the College&#x27;s own Bachelor of Divinity degree. This degree and the college&#x27;s three-year Bachelor of Theology degree were originally accredited by the New South Wales Government&#x27;s Department of Education and Training, doing away with the need for the accreditation through the Australian College of Theology. In 2011, the college became a self-accrediting Australian Higher Education Provider, able to design and accredit its own programs of study.

The college currently offers a suite of diplomas and degrees:

* Diploma of Biblical Theology-DBT (online, 1 year full-time)
* Advanced Diploma of Bible, Mission and Ministry-AdvDipBMM (part-time, 1 year full-time)
* Bachelor of Theology-BTh (3 years full-time)
* Bachelor of Divinity-BD (4 years full-time)
* Master of Arts in Theology-MA(Theol) (part-time, 2 years full-time) 
* Master of Theology-MTh (part-time, 2 years full-time) 
* Doctor of Philosophy-PhD (3 years full-time) 

==Community courses==
In the 1940s, under Hammond, the college began to train lay preachers within the Diocese of Sydney. This initially involved attending evening lectures by the principal, other members of the faculty and some graduates of the college. The notes from these courses formed the basis of the later correspondence course, the Sydney Preliminary Theological Certificate, which was widely used within Sydney and, in time, internationally. In the 1960s Knox invited B. Ward Powers to develop a three year correspondence course that would parallel the full-time course of the college for ministry candidates. Evening lectures continued alongside this correspondence course and eventually became the Diploma of Biblical Studies.

In late 2013 a significant review of the college&#x27;s correspondence and evening course was undertaken. The opportunity was taken to move into the online learning space. A chief concern of the review was to keep these courses as flexible as possible to allow them to be used in less resourced places throughout the world. The &#x27;Department of External Studies&#x27; was renamed Moore Distance and a variety of initiatives were undertaken to explore the possibilities. In 2020 these were brought together under the heading of the P.T.C. The P.T.C. is the college&#x27;s unaccredited online course of preliminary theological education.

This course is used in places around the world, in some cases becoming the basic training for church planters and pastors. These include Nigeria and India. Translation is under way into Chinese, Tamil, Hindi and Hausa languages. The college has also provided some of this information for use by other organisations such as MOCLAM and African Enterprise.

In 2017 the college began to offer an accredited entrance level diploma entirely online, the Diploma of Biblical Theology. A number of the units of this course provide for advanced standing in the college&#x27;s full-time degree program.

==Centres==
Moore College has developed four academic and ministry centres alongside its mainstream academic program:

# the Priscilla and Aquila Centre, which promotes, resources and encourages the ministry of women in partnership with men;
# the Centre for Christian Living, which seeks to provide accessible resources to the general Christian public for intelligent gospel engagement with the wider community;
# the Centre for Global Mission, which supports Christian organisations worldwide by providing high quality theological training resources;
# the Centre for Ministry Development, which provides specialised continuing training and education for graduates and others involved in Christian ministry;

In addition to these centres, the John Chapman Preaching Initiative is a network of activities designed to promote excellence in biblical expository preaching.

<text>Barry Nelson (born Robert Haakon Nielsen; April 16, 1917 – April 7, 2007) was an American actor, noted as the first actor to portray Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent James Bond.

==Early life==
Nelson was born in San Francisco, the son of Norwegian immigrants, Betsy (née Christophersen) and Trygve Nielsen. His year of birth has been subject to some debate, but is listed as 1917 on both his 1943 Army Air Forces enlistment record and his 1993 voter registration records. He graduated from UC Berkeley in 1941, where he performed as an actor in student theatre productions.

==Career==
With MGM, Nelson made his screen debut in the role as Paul Clark in &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; (1941) starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, with Donna Reed. He followed that with his role as Lew Rankin in the film noir &quot;Johnny Eager&quot; (1942) starring Robert Taylor and Lana Turner.

During his service in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, Nelson debuted on the Broadway stage in Moss Hart&#x27;s play &quot;Winged Victory&quot; (1943) in the role of Bobby Grills. His next Broadway appearance was as Peter Sloan, playwright, in Hart&#x27;s &quot;Light Up the Sky&quot; (1948). He appeared on Broadway with Barbara Bel Geddes in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot;. During the play&#x27;s run, he also starred in a CBS half-hour drama called &quot;The Hunter&quot;, premiering in July 1952. He played Bart Adams, a wealthy young American whose business activities involved him in a series of adventures. He also appeared with Lauren Bacall in the Abe Burrows comedy &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; in 1965 and with Dorothy Loudon in &quot;The Fig Leaves Are Falling&quot; in 1969. Nelson performed another Broadway role, that of Gus Hammer in &quot;The Rat Race&quot; (1949).

He was the first actor to play James Bond on screen in a 1954 adaptation of Ian Fleming&#x27;s novel &quot;Casino Royale&quot; on the television anthology series &quot;Climax!&quot; (preceding Sean Connery&#x27;s interpretation in &quot;Dr. No&quot; by eight years). Reportedly this was considered a pilot for a possible James Bond television series, though it is not known if Nelson intended to continue playing the character. Nelson played James Bond as an American agent whom some in the program call &quot;Jimmy&quot;. In 2004, Nelson said, &quot;At that time, no one had ever heard of James Bond...I was scratching my head wondering how to play it. I hadn&#x27;t read the book or anything like that because it wasn&#x27;t well-known.&quot; Bond did not become well known in the U.S. until President John F. Kennedy listed &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; among his 10 favorite books in a March 17, 1961, &quot;Life&quot; article.

The program also featured Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre, the primary villain. Nelson later noted the opportunity to work with Lorre was the reason he took the role. Originally broadcast live, the production was believed lost until a kinescope emerged in the 1980s. It was released to home video and is currently available on DVD as a bonus feature with the 1967 film adaptation of the novel.

During the 1959 television series, Nelson starred in 39 episodes of &quot;Hudson&#x27;s Bay&quot;, playing Johnathon Banner.

Nelson appeared as Grant Decker in &quot;Threat of Evil&quot;, a 1960 episode of &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;. His additional television credits include guest appearances on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (episode &quot;Stopover in a Quiet Town&quot;), &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, and in later years playing a hobo on an episode of &quot;The Ropers&quot;. He appeared regularly on television in the 1960s, having been one of the &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; mystery guests and later serving as a guest panelist on that popular CBS quiz show. Nelson was also a semi-regular panelist on the daytime and nighttime versions of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; for three years of its run from 1962 to 1965, as well as a guest panelist a few times in 1967. Nelson appeared second-most-frequently on the daytime show in the three years he was a semi-regular. He was one of the various hosts of the NBC Radio program &quot;Monitor&quot; during the mid-1960s. Nelson appeared in both the stage and screen versions of &quot;Mary, Mary&quot;.

He directed the 1968 play &quot;The Only Game in Town&quot;, as well as starring as Joe. In 1978, he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his role as Dan Connors in the Broadway musical &quot;The Act&quot; (1977) with Liza Minnelli. Nelson had a notable role as Stuart Ullman, the manager of the Overlook Hotel, in the Stanley Kubrick horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980). His final appearance on Broadway was as Julian Marsh in &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1986).

&quot;He was a very naturalistic, believable actor,&quot; said his agent, Francis Delduca. &quot;He was good at both comedy and the serious stuff.&quot;

==Personal life==
Nelson was married twice – first to actress Teresa Celli, from whom he was divorced in 1951 (according to his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary), and later to Nansilee (&quot;Nansi&quot;) Hoy, to whom he was married until his death.

Nelson and his second wife divided their time between homes in New York and France.

Nelson died on April 7, 2007, while traveling in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, nine days before his 90th birthday.

<text>A winery is a building or property that produces wine, or a business involved in the cultivation and production of wine, such as a wine company. Some wine companies own many wineries. Besides wine making equipment, larger wineries may also feature warehouses, bottling lines, laboratories, and large expanses of tanks known as tank farms. Wineries may have existed as long as 8,000 years ago.

==Ancient history==
The earliest known evidence of winemaking at a relatively large scale, if not evidence of actual wineries, has been found in the Middle East. In 2011 a team of archaeologists discovered a 6000 year old wine press in a cave in the Areni region of Armenia, and identified the site as a small winery. Previously, in the northern Zagros Mountains in Iran, jars over 7000 years old were discovered to contain tartaric acid crystals (a chemical marker of wine), providing evidence of winemaking in that region. Archaeological excavations in the southern Georgian region of Kvemo Kartli uncovered evidence of wine-making equipment (containers called &quot;qvevri&quot;) dating back 8000 years. In 2017 the remnants of an 8000-year-old facility for large-scale production was found 20 miles south of Tbilisi, Georgia.

==Purpose==

Wineries typically employ winemakers to produce various wines from grapes by following the winemaking process. This process involves the fermentation of fruit, as well as blending and aging of the juice. The grapes may be from vineyards owned by the winery or may be brought in from other locations. Many wineries also give tours and have cellar doors or tasting rooms where customers can taste wines before they make a purchase.

==Types and locations==

While some associate wineries with large winemaking regions such as Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley in California, the Barossa Valley in Australia or the legendary wine regions of France (Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne) and Italy, wineries can be found nearly everywhere. The east coast of the United States also has winemaking regions like New York&#x27;s Finger Lakes region, Aquidneck Island, RI and Long Island, NY and Cape May, NJ. Wineries do not have to be located adjacent to vineyards; grapes can be shipped anywhere. In addition, people make wine out of other fruits and plants (dandelion wine, apple wine, strawberry wine, honey wine, passion fruit wine), so these specialty wineries tend to pop up where the other substances are grown. For example, a winery in Hawaii produces pineapple wine.

==Farm wineries==

A class of winery license known as the farm winery allows farms to produce and sell wines on site. Farm wineries differ from commercial wineries in that the fruit which is the source of the wine is usually produced on the farm, and the final product is also sold on the farm. States such as New York have given a special permit to open a satellite store in a tourist area. New York&#x27;s passing of the Farm Winery Act of 1976 set an example for other states to pass similar laws.

Farm wineries usually operate at a smaller scale than commercial wineries. Farm wineries are a form of value added marketing, known as agritourism, for farmers who may otherwise struggle to show a profit.

==Micro-winery==
A micro-winery can either be at a small farm vineyard is a small wine producer or may not have its own vineyard, and instead sources its grape product from outside suppliers. The concept is similar to a microbrewery, in that small batches of product are made primarily for local consumption. The concept of the micro-winery is not as easily accepted as that of the microbrewery, however, as the general public has been conditioned to associate a winery as having a vineyard. A winery uses similar wine-making equipment as a major commercial winery, just on a smaller scale. Glass carboys and sanitary plastic pails are often seen in the facilities of a micro-winery. Typically, each batch of wine yields 23 Liters (6 US gallons). One of the primary differences of a micro-winery as compared to a typical winery is that a micro-winery is typically able to offer a wider range of wines; as it is not tied to the grapes it grows. New York State provides a specific micro-winery license that requires the microwinery to purchase local ingredients.

==Urban winery==
The urban winery is a recent phenomenon whereby a wine producer chooses to locate their winemaking facility in an urban setting within a city rather than in the traditional rural setting near the vineyards. With advances in technology and transportation, it is not a problem for an urban winery to grow their grapes in a remote location and then transport them to the urban facility for crushing, fermentation and aging. Urban wineries have been opened in cities across the United States including San Francisco; Sacramento; Portland, Oregon; Seattle; Frederick, Maryland; New York; Cincinnati; San Diego; and Los Angeles to name a few. Wilridge Winery was the first urban winery in Seattle.

==Winery wastewater==

Winery wastewater is primarily generated during the cleaning of winemaking equipment and facilities. The quantity and quality of wastewater shows seasonal variations. Wastewater handling involves collection, possible treatment, then disposal and/or reuse.

Peak wastewater generation occurs during the &quot;crush&quot;, in other words, when grapes are actively being processed into juice for fermentation. This process requires large amounts of clean water and results in a high wastewater output. To a lesser degree, wastewater is produced if boilers or water conditioning equipment is used.

<doc id="617041" wikidata="Q6505425" url="?curid=617041" title="Lay presidency">
<text>Lay presidency is a form of celebrating the Lord&#x27;s Supper (sometimes called the Eucharist) whereby the person presiding over the sacrament is not an ordained minister of religion. Similarly, when the celebrant is a deacon rather than a presbyter, the term diaconal presidency is used.

==Use==
Most independent Christian churches have a form of lay presidency as part of their communal worship. Mainstream denominations have been less inclined to allow lay people to preside over the sacrament, preferring to use ordained ministers or priests for this role.

==Denominations which use lay presidency==
In the United Methodist Church lay presidency is the norm. While many are ordained as presbyters (Elders) most clergy in the UMC are commissioned or licensed local pastors. These laypersons while called clergy in the Book of Discipline are nonetheless not ordained. These lay persons are only allowed to celebrate the sacraments in their appointments. 

==Theological considerations==
One area of conflict for Evangelical Christians in mainline churches is that, while the sacrament is a symbolic preaching of the gospel, only authorized and ordained ministers may preside, whereas non-ordained people are not allowed to do this, despite being allowed to preach the gospel in some cases. This may be seen as elevating the importance of the sacrament over the preaching of the gospel - that the symbolic preaching is more important than the literal. Evangelical elements in some mainline churches, for example the Diocese of Sydney within the Anglican Church of Australia, are considering introducing lay presidency due to this.

==North American Lutheran view==
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada authorise lay and diaconal presidency in certain extraordinary circumstances, within a finite time period and location, and only with the approval of the synodical bishop. In some cases, individuals who have received a pastoral call are authorized to celebrate the Lord&#x27;s Supper prior to their eventual ordination, although this practice is not in accord with the denomination&#x27;s own worship statement, The Use of the Means of Grace. 

Lay presidency of any kind would seem to be in conflict with Called to Common Mission, the full communion agreement between the ELCA and the Episcopal Church, which prohibits the practice. Theological opinions around the appropriateness of lay presidency are not uncommon in the ELCA, which is a merger of traditions that include both quasi-sacramental and purely functional understandings of ordained ministry. While the ELCA adopted the historic episcopate as part of Called to Common Mission, Lutherans have historically not understood ordination as leaving an indelible character on the minister. Nevertheless, ordained pastors who leave the ministerial roster and are later reinstated are not re-ordained, which would seem to indicate an implicit acceptance of this sacramental character. Lay presidency would also seem to contradict Article 14 of the Augsburg Confession, which states that &quot;no one should publicly teach in the Church or administer the Sacraments unless [he/she] be regularly called.&quot;

<doc id="617045" wikidata="Q1935482" url="?curid=617045" title="Mille Miglia">
<text>The Mille Miglia (, &quot;Thousand Miles&quot;) was an open-road, motorsport endurance race established in 1927 by the young Counts Francesco Mazzotti and Aymo Maggi. It took place in Italy 24 times from 1927 to 1957 (13 times before World War II, and 11 times from 1947).

Like the older Targa Florio and later the Carrera Panamericana in Mexico, the &quot;MM&quot; made grand tourers like Alfa Romeo, BMW, Ferrari, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche famous. The race brought out an estimated 5 million spectators.

From 1953 until 1957, the Mille Miglia was also a round of the World Sports Car Championship.

Since 1977, the &quot;Mille Miglia&quot; has been reborn as a regularity race for classic and vintage cars. Participation is limited to cars, produced no later than 1957, which had attended (or were registered to) the original race. The route (Brescia–Rome round trip) is similar to that of the original race, maintaining the point of departure/arrival in Viale Venezia in Brescia.

== Car numbering ==
Unlike modern day rallying, where cars are released with larger professional-class cars going before slower cars, in the Mille Miglia the smaller, slower, lower displacement cars started first. This made organisation simpler, as marshals did not have to be on duty for as long of a period, and it minimised the period that roads had to be closed. From 1949, cars were assigned numbers according to their start time. For example, the 1955 Moss/Jenkinson car, #722, left Brescia at 07:22 (see below), while the first cars had started at 21:00 the previous day. In the early days of the race, even winners needed 16 hours or more, so most competitors had to start before midnight and arrive after dusk, if at all.

==History==
=== Before World War II ===

The Mille Miglia race was established by the young Counts Aymo Maggi and Franco Mazzotti, sports manager Renzo Castagneto, and motoring journalist Giovanni Canestrini, apparently in response to the Italian Grand Prix being moved from their home town of Brescia to Monza. Together with a group of wealthy associates, they chose a race from Brescia to Rome and back, a figure-eight shaped course of roughly 1,500 km—or a thousand Roman miles. Later races followed twelve other routes of varying total lengths.

The first race started on 26 March 1927, with seventy-seven (77) starters—all Italian—of which fifty-one (51) reached the finishing post at Brescia by the end of the race. The first Mille Miglia covered 1,618 km, corresponding to just over 1,005 American or British miles. Entry was strictly restricted to unmodified production cars, and the entrance fee was set at a nominal 1 lira. The winner, Giuseppe Morandi, completed the course in just under 21 hours 5 minutes, averaging nearly 78 km/h (48 mph) in his 2-litre OM-produced car; Brescia-based Officine Meccaniche (OM) swept the top three places.

Tazio Nuvolari won the 1930 Mille Miglia in an Alfa Romeo 6C. Having started after his teammate and rival Achille Varzi, Nuvolari was leading the race, but was still behind Varzi, the holder of provisional second position, on the road. In the dim half-light of early dawn, Nuvolari tailed Varzi with his headlights off, thereby not being visible in the latter&#x27;s rear-view mirrors. He then overtook Varzi on the straight roads approaching the finish at Brescia, pulling alongside and flicking his headlights on.

The event was usually dominated by local Italian drivers and marques, but three races were won by foreign cars. The first one was in 1931, when German driver Rudolf Caracciola, famous in Grand Prix racing, and riding mechanic Wilhelm Sebastian won with their big supercharged Mercedes-Benz SSKL, averaging for the first time more than 100 km/h (63 mph) in a Mille Miglia. Caracciola had received very little support from the factory due to the economic crisis at that time. He did not have enough mechanics to man all necessary service points. After performing a pit stop, they had to hurry across Italy, cutting the triangle-shaped course short in order to arrive in time before the race car.

The race was briefly stopped by Italian leader Benito Mussolini after an accident in 1938 killed a number of spectators. This race saw 11 spectator fatalities; a Lancia Aprilla being driven by Angelo Mignanego and Dr. Luigi Bruzzo, just before they entered Bologna, went off the road and crashed into a whole group of spectators lining the road to watch the race. Ten people were killed, five of whom were children, and 26 were injured; both competitors survived. Earlier in the race, another accident took the life of a 12-year-old girl in Padova. These accidents caused such an uproar in Italian society that the decision making of the race’s future went to the top of the Italian fascist government: Mussolini himself. The race was not run in 1939, and when it resumed in April 1940, shortly before Italy entered World War II, it was dubbed the &quot;Grand Prix of Brescia&quot;, and held on a short course in the plains of northern Italy that was lapped nine times.

This event saw the debut of the first Enzo Ferrari-owned marque AAC (Auto Avio Costruzioni) with the Tipo 815. Despite being populated mainly by Italian car makers, it was the aerodynamically-improved BMW 328, driven by Germans Huschke von Hanstein/Walter Bäumer, that won the high-speed race with an all-time high average of , even though the 1940 event was run on a much shorter and localised 100 km (62.5 mi) circuit.

=== After World War II ===

The Italians continued to dominate their race after the war, now again on a single big lap through Italy. Mercedes made another good effort in 1952 with the underpowered Mercedes-Benz 300 SL &quot;Gullwing&quot;, scoring second, with the German crew Karl Kling/Hans Klenk that later in the year would win the Carrera Panamericana. Caracciola, in a comeback attempt, was fourth.

Few other non-Italians managed podium finishes in the 1950s, among them Juan Manuel Fangio, Peter Collins, and Wolfgang von Trips.

==== Stirling Moss at the Mille Miglia ====

In 1955, Mercedes made another attempt at winning the Mille Miglia; this time, with careful preparation and a more powerful car, the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR, which was based on the Formula One car (Mercedes-Benz W196), entirely different from their sports cars carrying the 300 SL name.

Both young German Hans Herrmann, who had remarkable previous efforts with Porsche, and Briton Stirling Moss relied on the support of navigators. Meanwhile, Juan Manuel Fangio (car #658) preferred to drive alone as usual, as he considered open road races dangerous after his co-pilot and friend was killed during a race across South America. Karl Kling also drove alone, in the fourth Mercedes, #701.

Similar to his teammates, Moss and his navigator, motor race journalist Denis Jenkinson, ran a total of six reconnaissance laps beforehand, enabling &quot;Jenks&quot; to make course notes (pace notes) on a scroll of paper 18 ft (540 cm) long, which he read from and gave directions to Moss during the race by a coded system of 15 hand signals. Although this undoubtedly helped them, Moss&#x27;s innate ability and the 300 SLR&#x27;s exceptional build quality were clearly the predominant factors. Moss was competing against drivers with a large amount of local knowledge of the route, so the reconnaissance laps were considered an equaliser, rather than an advantage.

Car #704 with Hans Herrmann and Hermann Eger was said to be fastest in the early stages. Herrmann had already had a remarkable race in 1954, when the gate on a railway level crossing was lowered in the last moment before the fast train to Rome passed. Driving a very low Porsche 550 Spyder, Herrmann decided it was too late for a brake attempt; knocked on the back of the helmet of his navigator Herbert Linge to make him duck; and they barely passed below the gates and before the train, to the surprise of the spectators. Herrmann was less lucky in 1955, having to abandon the race after a brake failure on the Futa Pass between Florence and Bologna, while Kling crashed just outside Rome.

After 10 hours, 7 minutes and 48 seconds, Moss/Jenkinson arrived in Brescia in their Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR with the now-famous #722, setting the event record at an average of , which was fastest ever on this variant of the course, not to be beaten in the remaining two years. Fangio arrived a few minutes later in the #658 car, but having started 24 min earlier, it actually took him about 30 minutes longer, having engine problems at Pescara, through Rome. By the time Fangio reached Florence, a fuel injection pipe had broken, and he was running on seven cylinders. This race was unusual in that it didn&#x27;t rain at any part of the route; it almost always rained at least once somewhere along all the routes used throughout the race’s history. The extended good weather helped Moss and Jenkinson to set their all time record.

=== The end ===

The race was known for its danger, not only to drivers, but also to spectators. Over its 30-year history, a total of 56 people died. The deaths involved 24 drivers/co-drivers and 32 spectators. Most of these fatal accidents occurred on the fastest parts of the route, and almost always involved spectator fatalities. The most notorious part was the very fast first 200 miles of the circuit between Brescia and Ravenna, where more than half the fatalities during the 1950s happened. With the exception of 1927, 1931–1934 and 1936–1937, there was at least one fatal accident every year, and of the 56 total known fatalities during this race, 35 of them occurred between 1948 and 1957—an average of nearly four per race.

Racing the Mille Miglia ended after two fatal crashes involving multiple people occurred during the 1957 race. The first crash involved the factory-entered 4.0-litre Ferrari 335 S. Eleven people were killed at the village of Guidizzolo: Spanish driver Alfonso de Portago, American co-driver/navigator Edmund Nelson, and nine spectators. Five of the spectators killed were children who were standing along the race course. Portago was called in as a last-minute replacement, and was already unsettled by a race he felt was too dangerous. The crash was caused by a worn tire striking the sharp edge of a cat&#x27;s eye in the road.
The second crash took the life of Netherlands driver Joseph Göttgens at Florence, driving a Triumph TR3 in heavy rain.

From 1958 to 1961, the Mille Miglia resumed as a rally-like event, limited to legal speeds with a few special stages that were driven at racing speed. After 1961, this once-prestigious race was permanently discontinued.

===Circuit variants===
The original route from 1927 to 1930 was run anti-clockwise, and headed down to Rome via Piadena, Parma, Modena, Bologna, Florence, Siena and Viterbo, then it headed north up a mountainous route through Perugia and Gubbio, then would join the Adriatic sea route at Porto Recanati, then through Pesaro, Rimini, Forli, Bologna, Ferrara, Padova, and Treviso. This variant used to use a route that went into the Dolomite town of Feltre; then headed south towards Vicenza, Verona; and then finally, towards Brescia. The first part of the circuit was changed in 1931, bypassing the Piadena route and going directly south towards Cremona, and then going east and rejoining the existing route at Parma. This route was used until 1933. 

The next route, used from 1934 to 1936, saw Feltre and the Dolomites section bypassed, and a route that ran near Venice was added, but the rest of the route was the same. From 1937 to 1938, the route was substantially modified. Although the top half remained more or less the same, the bottom half was rerouted at Florence to run west towards Lucca and Pisa, and then ran along the Tyrrehennian West Coast down through Livorno, Grosseto and Vetralla before reaching Rome. The circuit then went up and cut through the mountainous range, bypassing Perugia right up to Pesaro, and joining the existing route. This was the last of the pre-WWII Mille Miglia circuits that ran through Bologna twice. The 1940 event was called the &quot;Grand Prix of Brescia&quot;, and was run on a very fast course in northern Italy, that went from Brescia, went west at the village of Le Grazie, and then went north from Cremona back to Brescia.

In 1947, the race was run clockwise for the first time, and the circuit route was modified. This was the longest of all the Mille Miglia routes, at . Treviso and Venice were bypassed, and the route from the 1937 variant remained the same; but from Piacenza, the route went further west towards Alessandra, and then went north and east from Turin to Novara, Milan, Bergamo, and finally ending at Brescia. 

In 1949, the race was reverted to being run anti-clockwise, and was also rerouted. This was perhaps the fastest variant of the Mille Miglia circuit route- Bologna, Modena, Florence, and the Futa and Raticosa Passes were all bypassed as this variant ran largely along the Italian coasts; also bypassed was the whole northwestern section, which included Turin and Milan, with a new route going through Cremona, and rejoining at Piacenza, and shortened the route down to its intended length at . At Parma, the circuit ran south through another route through the Apennine mountains towards La Spezia and Massa, before rejoining the 1947 variant at Pisa. The circuit was then rerouted to go through the mountain towns of Rieti and L&#x27;Aquila, and then went further east towards Pescara, where it went along the Adriatic coast before rejoining the 1947 circuit at Pesaro. The circuit then cut past Forli, and went through Ravenna, before rejoining the previous route at Ferrara.

The 1950 variant saw the race being switched back to being run clockwise permanently. The circuit remained largely the same up until Pisa; the route that went east to Florence that was first introduced in 1937 was re-introduced, and then part of the original route up through the Futa and Raticosa Passes to Bologna, then going west towards Modena and Piacenza was also re-introduced. 

For the 1951 event, the direct route between Ravenna and Rimini was bypassed, and the circuit was diverted from Ravenna to Forli, and back to Rimini again. However, more significantly, the Tyhrennian coast section first introduced in 1937 was eliminated, and part of the original route that ran from Rome to Florence via Viterbo and Siena was re-introduced. The route was not changed until 1954, when a new section was introduced to pay tribute to Tazio Nuvolari, which diverted from Cremona and ran through his hometown of Mantua, which was the final iteration of the circuit used for the original race.

== Mille Miglia Storica ==

Since 1977, the race was revived as the &quot;Mille Miglia Storica&quot;, a parade for pre-1957 cars that takes several days, which also spawned the 2007 documentary film &quot;Mille Miglia – The Spirit of a Legend&quot;.

== Mille Miglia Museum ==
Since November 2004, the former Monastery of Sant&#x27;Eufemia in Brescia houses the &quot;Mille Miglia Museum&quot;, which illustrates the history of this car race with films, memorabilia, dresses, posters, and a number of classic cars that are periodically replaced by other in case of participation in events.

== Name usage ==
Owner of the trademark logo of Mille Miglia is the Automobile Club Brescia.

Mille Miglia was also the name of Alitalia&#x27;s frequent flyer program.

Mille Miglia is also the name of a jacket, named after the race, inspired by the 1920s racewear and designed by Massimo Osti for his CP Company clothing label. The garment features goggles built into the hood and originally had a small circular window in the sleeve enabling the wearer to see their watch. The jackets have been produced for a long period and are still popular with British football casuals.

As a sponsor and timekeeper of the Storica event, the event has lent its name and its trademark logo to Chopard for a series of sports watches. For promotions, Chopard uses photographs from the event by photographer Giacomo Bretzel.

Mille Miglia Red is the name for a colour used by Chevrolet on its Corvette models. The colour was offered between 1972 and 1975.

In 1982 the Mille Miglia endurance race was revived as a road rally event.

&quot;Mille Miglia&quot; is also the title of a song from Lucio Dalla&#x27;s album &quot;Automobili&quot; (1976). The song describes anecdotes about the 1947 edition of the race.

Kaneko released two arcade games based on the race in 1994 (&quot;1000 Miglia: Great 1000 Miles Rally&quot;) and 1995 (&quot;Mille Miglia 2: Great 1000 Miles Rally&quot;). SCi Games released a PlayStation game simply named &quot;Mille Miglia&quot; and endorsed by Stirling Moss in 2000 in PAL regions.

In 2008, Alfa Romeo created a limited-edition version of its Tipo 939 Spider called the &quot;Mille Miglia&quot;. Only 11 cars were built—eight left-hand drive and three right-hand drive—with each numbered car corresponding to one of the marque&#x27;s Mille Miglia victories. Each car carried a small metal plate with details of the race.

== In media ==
The film &quot;Ferrari&quot; (2023), directed by Michael Mann and written by Troy Kennedy Martin, follows the personal and professional struggles of Enzo Ferrari, the Italian founder of the car manufacturer Ferrari, during the summer of 1957 as Scuderia Ferrari prepares to compete in the 1957 Mille Miglia. Adam Driver portrays the titular subject, and Penélope Cruz, Shailene Woodley, Sarah Gadon, Gabriel Leone, Jack O&#x27;Connell, and Patrick Dempsey co-star.

<text>The red-cockaded woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis) is a woodpecker endemic to the southeastern United States. It is a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

== Description ==
The red-cockaded woodpecker is small- to mid-sized species, being intermediate in size between North America&#x27;s two most widespread woodpeckers (the downy and hairy woodpeckers). This species measures in length, spans across the wings and weighs . Among the standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . Its back is barred with black and white horizontal stripes. The red-cockaded woodpecker&#x27;s most distinguishing feature is a black cap and nape that encircle large white cheek patches. Rarely visible, except perhaps during the breeding season and periods of territorial defense, the male has a small red streak on each side of its black cap called a &quot;cockade&quot;, hence its name. The species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN and as Threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

== Behavior ==
The red-cockaded woodpecker feeds primarily on ants, beetles, cockroaches, caterpillars, wood-boring insects, and spiders, and occasionally fruit and berries. The vast majority of foraging is on pines, with a strong preference for large trees, though they will occasionally forage on hardwoods and even on corn earworms in cornfields.

Red-cockaded woodpeckers are a territorial, nonmigratory, cooperative breeding species, frequently having the same mate for several years. The nesting season runs from April to June. The breeding female lays three to four eggs in the breeding male&#x27;s roost cavity. Group members incubate the small white eggs for 10–13 days. Once hatched, the nestlings remain in the nest cavity for about 26–29 days. Upon fledging, the young often remain with the parents, forming groups of up to nine or more members, but more typically three to four members. There is only one pair of breeding birds within each group, and they normally only raise a single brood each year. The other group members, called helpers, usually males from the previous breeding season, help incubate the eggs and raise the young. Juvenile females generally leave the group before the next breeding season, in search of solitary male groups. The main predators of red-cockaded nests are rat snakes, although corn snakes also represent a threat. Studies have also explored the possibility that southern flying squirrels might have a negative impact on red-cockaded woodpecker populations due competition over cavities and predation on eggs and nestlings. 

== Distribution and habitat ==
Historically, this woodpecker&#x27;s range extended in the southeastern United States from Florida to New Jersey and Maryland, as far west as eastern Texas and Oklahoma, and inland to Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Today it is estimated that there are about 5,000 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers, or 12,500 birds, from Florida to Virginia and west to southeast Oklahoma and eastern Texas, representing about one percent of the woodpecker&#x27;s original population (over 1 million individuals at one point). They have become locally extinct (extirpated) in Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, and Tennessee.

The red-cockaded woodpecker makes its home in fire-dependent pine savannas. Longleaf pines (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;) are most commonly preferred, but other species of southern pine are also acceptable. While other woodpeckers bore out cavities in dead trees where the wood is rotten and soft, the red-cockaded woodpecker is the only one that excavates cavities exclusively in living pine trees. The older pines favored by the red-cockaded woodpecker often suffer from a fungal infection called red heart rot which attacks the center of the trunk, causing the inner wood, the heartwood, to become soft. Cavities are generally excavated over 1 to 3 years.

The aggregate of cavity trees is called a cluster and may include 1 to 20 or more cavity trees on 3 to 60 acres (12,000 to 240,000 m2). The average cluster is about 10 acres (40,000 m2). Cavity trees that are being actively used have numerous, small resin wells which exude sap. The birds keep the sap flowing apparently as a cavity defense mechanism against rat snakes and possibly other predators. The typical territory for a group ranges from about 125 to 200 acres (500,000 to 800,000 m2), but observers have reported territories running from a low of around 60 acres (240,000 m2), to an upper extreme of more than 600 acres (2.40 km2). The size of a particular territory is related to both habitat suitability and population density. Where red-cockaded woodpeckers occur at high densities, individuals appear to spend more time in territorial defense, potentially at the expense of foraging and time allocated to reproduction, resulting in reduced clutch size and fledgling production.
== Ecology ==

The red-cockaded woodpecker is a keystone species in southern pine forest ecosystems. Their cavities are used secondarily by at least 27 species of vertebrates, including small birds (e.g., eastern bluebirds, tufted titmouse, and great crested flycatcher), mammals (e.g., evening bat), herpetofauna (e.g., broad-headed skinks, gray treefrogs), and invertebrates (e.g., wasps, bees, moths, and ants). 

Pileated woodpeckers (&quot;Dryocopus pileatus&quot;), often enlarge cavities created by red-cockaded woodpeckers, making the tree uninhabitable to the red-cockaded woodpecker, but providing habitat for larger birds like eastern screech owls, wood ducks, and American kestrels. Smaller animals, like the red-bellied woodpecker, red-headed woodpecker, and southern flying squirrel may compete with red-cockaded woodpeckers for unenlarged nests.

== Conservation ==
The red-cockaded woodpecker suffers from habitat fragmentation when habitable pines are removed. When a larger cluster of birds gets split up, it is difficult for the young to find mates and eventually becomes an issue regarding species dispersal. While dispersing in search of new places to settle, the red-cockaded woodpecker encounters habitats of competing woodpecker species.

The red-cockaded woodpecker has been the focus of conservation efforts even before the passing of the Endangered Species Act in 1973. In Florida, pairs are being released at DuPuis Management Area and other privately-owned land.

Due to the high importance of nesting habitat on the woodpecker&#x27;s reproduction, much management has been dedicated to create ideal and more numerous nesting sites. Nesting clusters have been spared from forestry activity to preserve old-growth, large diameter trees. The nesting sites themselves have also been managed to make them more appealing. The use of controlled burning has been used to reduce deciduous growth around nesting colonies. The red-cockaded woodpecker has been shown to prefer nesting sites with less deciduous growth. The use of controlled burning must be exercised with caution due to the highly flammable resin barriers formed by the woodpecker.

In an effort to increase the red-cockaded woodpecker population, states such as Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia&#x27;s wildlife management are creating artificial cavities in Longleaf Pine trees. There are two methods in which wildlife management officers use to insert cavities in long leaf pines. The most respected and latest approach is to carve out a nesting cavity in the tree and insert a man-made rot-resistant wooden box with a PVC pipe small enough for only a red-cockaded woodpecker to fit through. These boxes, also known as &quot;inserts&quot;, can last up to 10 years. The older and less used approach is to drill a cavity into the tree in hopes that the birds will settle there and nest.

Due to the energetically expensive process of excavating new cavities, more energy is expended competing for existing home ranges rather than colonizing new areas. Cavities are highly sought-out resources by all cavity dwelling species and red-cockadeds have been observed roosting in them as early as the same night the boxes are installed. Alpha males usually reside in the best cavity, alpha females in the second best cavity until breeding season when their male partners allow their cavity to turn into the nest cavity. Juveniles are left with the lower quality cavities or no cavities at all, forcing them to roost on a branch outside overnight. Due to the fact that each family member requires a cavity to roost, land managers may choose to insert additional artificial cavities to boost survival of juveniles. Red-cockaded woodpeckers will even recolonize abandoned ranges when cavities are created.

In addition to the creation of new cavities, methods for protecting existing cavities are also used. The most common technique employed is a restrictor plate. The plate prevents other species from enlarging or changing the shape of the cavity entrance. These restrictor plates must be carefully monitored, however, to ensure that no hindrance is given to the woodpecker. Adjustments must also be made as the tree grows. Southern flying squirrel exclusion devices may be considered as well. A study suggested that managers establish new woodpecker clusters away from streams and limit the use of excess cavities, both factors important in the recruitment of flying squirrels. Application of capsaicin on flying squirrel at cavities could be a cost-effective method.

===Intentional habitat destruction by landowners===

Private landowners are prohibited from modifying habitats or taking animals that are protected by the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In response to the listing of the red-cockaded woodpecker, it became common in Eastern Texas for landowners to begin cutting down the long-leaf pine trees so that the woodpeckers would not nest in their trees. By eliminating the trees on a piece of privately owned land, the land owners no longer have to abide by the requirements of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists. By removing available habitat for the species, landowners are able to benefit economically and maintain construction rights to the property. This led to the development of the Safe Harbor Agreements in which landowners agreed to manage their land in consistency with the conservation of a species of special conservation concern in return for relaxed ESA protection rules that allow a more flexible management of their own land.

<text>Richmond, population 3,232 (2016), is a town nestled amidst rolling farmlands on the Saint-François River between Sherbrooke and Drummondville, in the heart of Estrie in Quebec, Canada.

==History==

Originally settled by colonists from New England, Montreal and the Richelieu River valley 1798, Richmond is one of the oldest settlements in the former region of the Eastern Townships.

Richmond grew in importance during the 1800s when it became a key railway junction. The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad opened between Montreal and Portland, Maine, on April 4, 1853 and was purchased four months later and absorbed into the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR)&#x27;s system. Two years later, the GTR opened a line from the mainline in Richmond northeast to Lévis to connect Montreal with Quebec City. The line was eventually extended further east to Rivière-du-Loup and a connection with the Intercolonial Railway, which operated trains on the GTR through Richmond to Montreal until 1897.

The town itself was first called &quot;Richmond&quot; in 1820, when a post office was inaugurated. By the 1860s Richmond was an important centre, with a college, literary institute and a public library.

Richmond&#x27;s importance has waned since the 1930s, however, as the railways have also come to play a lesser role in the economy. The GTR was absorbed into the Canadian National Railways (CNR) and the line to Levis was abandoned in favour of more direct lines from Montreal to Quebec City. In 1989, CNR sold the entire railway line from Montreal to Portland, via Richmond, to a short line operator.

===Richmond today===
Richmond as it exists today was created on December 29, 1999 following the merger of the &quot;old&quot; town of Richmond on the right bank of the Saint-François and the village of Melbourne, located on the other side.

===Origin of the name &quot;Richmond&quot;===
The name &quot;Richmond&quot; is in memory of Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond and Lennox (1764–1819), Governor General of Upper Canada from 1818 to 1819.

===Origin of the name &quot;Melbourne&quot;===
The origin of the name &quot;Melbourne&quot; is uncertain, but the village is believed to have been named for Melbourne, Derbyshire or Melbourne, Hampshire.

==Climate==
Richmond has a humid continental climate typical of southern Quebec. Precipitation is high year-round, resulting in warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. There is a significant temperature difference between seasons as typical of the North American interior, with as July high and as the high for January.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Richmond had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="617058" wikidata="Q423333" url="?curid=617058" title="Transcription preinitiation complex">
<text>The preinitiation complex (abbreviated PIC) is a complex of approximately 100 proteins that is necessary for the transcription of protein-coding genes in eukaryotes and archaea. The preinitiation complex positions RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at gene transcription start sites, denatures the DNA, and positions the DNA in the RNA polymerase II active site for transcription.

The minimal PIC includes RNA polymerase II and six general transcription factors: TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Additional regulatory complexes (such as the mediator coactivator and chromatin remodeling complexes) may also be components of the PIC.

Preinitiation complexes are also formed during RNA Polymerase I and RNA Polymerase III transcription.

==Assembly (RNA Polymerase II)==

A classical view of PIC formation at the promoter involves the following steps:

* TATA binding protein (TBP, a subunit of TFIID) binds the promoter, creating a sharp bend in the promoter DNA.
** Animals have some TBP-related factors (TRF; TBPL1/TBPL2). They can replace TBP in some special contexts.
* TBP recruits TFIIA, then TFIIB, to the promoter.
* TFIIB recruits RNA polymerase II and TFIIF to the promoter.
* TFIIE joins the growing complex and recruits TFIIH which has protein kinase activity (phosphorylates RNA polymerase II within the CTD) and DNA helicase activity (unwinds DNA at promoter). It also recruits nucleotide-excision repair proteins.
* Subunits within TFIIH that have ATPase and helicase activity create negative superhelical tension in the DNA.
* Negative superhelical tension causes approximately one turn of DNA to unwind and form the transcription bubble. 
* The template strand of the transcription bubble engages with the RNA polymerase II active site.
* RNA synthesis begins.
* After synthesis of ~10 nucleotides of RNA, and an obligatory phase of several abortive transcription cycles, RNA polymerase II escapes the promoter region to transcribe the remainder of the gene.

An alternative hypothesis of PIC assembly postulates the recruitment of a pre-assembled &quot;RNA polymerase II holoenzyme&quot; directly to the promoter (composed of all, or nearly all GTFs and RNA polymerase II and regulatory complexes), in a manner similar to the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP).

== Other preinitiation complexes ==

=== In Archaea ===
Archaea have a preinitiation complex resembling that of a minimized Pol II PIC, with a TBP and an Archaeal transcription factor B (TFB, a TFIIB homolog). The assembly follows a similar sequence, starting with TBP binding to the promoter. An interesting aspect is that the entire complex is bound in an inverse orientation compared to those found in eukaryotic PIC. They also use TFE, a TFIIE homolog, which assists in transcription initiation but is not required.

=== RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) ===
Formation of the Pol I preinitiation complex requires the binding of selective factor 1 (SL1 or TIF-IB) to the core element of the rDNA promoter. SL1 is a complex composed of TBP and at least three TBP-associated factors (TAFs). For basal levels of transcription, only SL1 and the initiation-competent form of Pol I (Pol Iβ), characterized by RRN3 binding, are required.

For activated transcription levels, UBTF (UBF) is also required. UBTF binds as a dimer to both the upstream control element (UCE) and core element of the rDNA promoter, bending the DNA to form an enhanceosome. SL1 has been found to stabilize the binding of UBTF to the rDNA promoter.

The subunits of the Pol I PIC differ between organisms.

=== RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) ===
Pol III has three classes of initiation, which start with different factors recognizing different control elements but all converging on TFIIIB (similar to TFIIB-TBP; consists of TBP/TRF, a TFIIB-related factor, and a B″ unit) recruiting the Pol III preinitiation complex. The overall architecture resembles that of Pol II. Only TFIIIB needs to remain attached during elongation.

After months of planning a &quot;perfect crime,&quot; they abduct a woman at random, strangle her, and plant evidence implicating Richard&#x27;s marijuana dealer, janitor Ray Feathers. Detective Cassie Mayweather and her new partner, Sam Kennedy, investigate. Cassie has sex with Sam early on as she had with previous partners, but won&#x27;t let him see her chest, and curtly sends him home afterwards.

Footprints at the crime scene lead to Richard, and vomit nearby implicates Justin. Both have alibis, and deny knowing each other, but Cassie is convinced that Richard is the murderer and Justin is involved. Sam criticizes her refusal to consider other suspects, as most of the physical evidence points away from the two boys. Cassie&#x27;s boss, Captain Rod Cody, and her ex, Assistant D.A. Al Swanson, fearing Richard&#x27;s influential parents, take Cassie off the case. Richard kills Ray, and makes it appear like a suicide. Sam, following the planted evidence, tracks down Ray. When he finds Ray dead, the woman&#x27;s murder appears solved; but Sam decides that Cassie may be right, and continues the investigation.

Justin, who has a crush on classmate Lisa Mills, works up the courage to ask her out. A jealous Richard seduces Lisa, then gives Justin a video clip of them having sex. Justin is enraged, but regains control, knowing Sam is still watching them. Cassie begins receiving calls from her ex-husband Carl Hudson, who went to prison for stabbing her in the chest 17 times. His parole hearing is coming up, and he wants her to speak on his behalf. Cassie confides to Sam that although she became a cop to prove to herself that she wasn&#x27;t a victim, she is terrified at the prospect of seeing Carl again. She also confesses that Richard reminds her of Carl, which is why she is convinced of Richard&#x27;s guilt, and obsessed with proving it.

Sam and Cassie bring Richard and Justin in for separate interrogations, trying to induce them to implicate each other, but neither of them talk, and both are released. At the victim&#x27;s home, Cassie determines how the boys carried out the abduction and altered the physical evidence. Justin and Richard, knowing that Cassie is closing in on them, flee to an abandoned house, where Richard produces two revolvers and proposes a mutual suicide. On the count of three, Justin shoots into the air, but Richard does not. Justin demands to see Richard&#x27;s gun, which is unloaded. As a furious Justin is about to shoot Richard, Cassie arrives. Richard grabs Justin&#x27;s gun and shoots at Cassie, wounding Justin instead. Cassie gives chase, but Richard strangles her on a rickety balcony jutting out over a cliff. Cassie gains the upper hand and knocks Richard off the balcony; he falls to his death. Justin grabs Cassie, who is hanging on the edge of the balcony, and pulls her back into the house.

Cassie assures Justin that she will intercede on his behalf to get him tried as a juvenile, since he was an innocent dupe, manipulated by the ruthless Richard. Then she notices a mark on her neck caused by Richard&#x27;s large ring, and realizes that the dead woman&#x27;s neck did not have a similar mark. Confronted with the evidence, Justin confesses that he strangled the victim, proving his &quot;courage&quot; to Richard, and is arrested.

Cassie faces her fears and enters the courtroom to testify at Carl&#x27;s parole hearing. The bailiff calls her to the stand by her legal name: Jessica Marie Hudson.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film was released April 19, 2002 in the United States and Canada and grossed $9.3 million in 2,663 theaters its opening weekend, ranking #3 at the box office. The film grossed a total of $56,714,147 worldwide — $31,945,749 in the United States and Canada and $24,768,398 in other territories.

=== Critical reception ===
Reviews for the film were mixed-to-negative. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 30% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A predictable police procedural that works better as a character study rather than a thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert awarded three stars out of a possible four, stating: &quot;Bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability, creating a character you&#x27;d like to like, and could like, if she weren&#x27;t so sad, strange and turned in upon herself. She throws herself into police work not so much because she&#x27;s dedicated as because she needs the distraction, needs to keep busy and be good to assure herself of her worth. As she draws the net closer, and runs into more danger and more official opposition, the movie more or less helplessly starts thinking to itself about that cliff above the sea, but at least the climax shows us that Bullock can stay in character no matter what.&quot;

A. O. Scott, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that &quot;much of this new Barbet Schroeder film -- a star vehicle for Sandra Bullock, who is also an executive producer -- follows well-worn paths of the cops-and-psycho-killer routine.&quot; He describes Haywood and Pendleton as &quot;a pair of teenage Nietzsche-heads who might be appearing in a remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rope&quot; for The WB network.&quot; Scott adds,

The real surprise, given the secondhand material, is that not everything proceeds by rote in &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot;, which opens today [19 April 2002] nationwide. The rickety structure of the movie&#x27;s main plot sustains some clammy and fascinating psychological inquiry, and one suspects that, as in &quot;Single White Female&quot;, Mr. Schroeder&#x27;s interest is less in the story than in the possibilities it affords for exercising his perverse, chilly curiosity about power, intimacy and the varieties of human distress. This movie is most interesting as a study of two parallel relationships, neither one primarily sexual (though sexuality is the subtext of one and the half-accidental consequence of the other), but both saturated with enough longing, envy, tenderness and loathing to make actual sex a bit redundant.&quot;

Scott also remarks briefly on &quot;the scene in which [Cassie] is attacked by an angry baboon. The baboon, at least, is unexpected, though also inexplicable.&quot;

<text>Hooper is a 1978 American action comedy film directed by Hal Needham and starring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jan-Michael Vincent, Brian Keith, Robert Klein, James Best and Adam West. The film serves as a tribute to stuntmen and stuntwomen in what was at one time an underrecognized profession. At the time of filming, Field and Reynolds were in a relationship, having met on the set of &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; the previous year.

==Plot==
Sonny Hooper is the stunt coordinator on the action film &quot;The Spy Who Laughed at Danger&quot;, directed by Roger Deal and starring Adam West. Sonny&#x27;s antics and wisecracks are a trial for the egotistical director and his officious but cowardly assistant, Tony. Years of numerous &quot;gags&quot; and his use of alcohol and painkillers are beginning to take their toll. Sonny lives with his girlfriend Gwen Doyle, whose father Jocko is a retired stuntman.

Sonny is coerced by a friend into performing at a charity show, where he meets Delmore &quot;Ski&quot; Shidski, a newcomer who makes a spectacular entrance. They become friends after a barroom brawl, and Sonny invites Ski to work with him on the film. They begin a friendly rivalry in which the dangerous stunts escalate. After a freefall from a record , Sonny quietly consults with his doctor, who warns him that one more bad fall could render him quadriplegic.

Roger decides to change the film&#x27;s ending, adding a climactic earthquake complete with many explosions, fires and car crashes. Sonny and Ski would race through the carnage to a nearby gorge, where the bridge explodes before they can cross it. Roger suggests they rappel down one side of the gorge and up the other to safety, but Ski proposes jumping a car over the gorge, with Hooper adding that a rocket car can make the jump. Roger loves the idea, ignoring the warnings that Sonny and Ski might not survive the landing even if the car lands on its wheels. Max Berns, the movie&#x27;s producer and a longtime friend of Sonny&#x27;s, warns Roger that the film is already over budget and they can&#x27;t afford the $100,000 Hooper wants to perform the rocket car jump. Roger tells Max he wants the rocket car ending and to make cuts elsewhere. Tony is sent to talk Hooper down from his high price, but fails.

Meanwhile, Jocko suffers a stroke, but denies the gravity of his condition. Seeing Jocko in the hospital motivates Sonny to promise Gwen that he will quit the business after the film wraps. Then, Sonny&#x27;s assistant and best friend Cully reveals the rocket car stunt and Sonny&#x27;s secret visit to his doctor to a horrified Gwen. Sonny later tells Roger that he is backing out of the gag, but Max convinces him to reconsider, as no qualified stuntman is available, or willing, to replace him and Ski cannot do it alone. Having no other choice, and even after Gwen threatens to leave him, Sonny goes through with the gag.

Sonny and Ski perform the first part of the gag perfectly. As they arrive at the now-demolished bridge, they find that the rocket pressure is below the minimum needed to make the jump, but they attempt it anyway. The rocket car clears the gorge, but overshoots the prepared landing area and lands hard on the far side. Ski emerges from the car on his own, but the impact is more of a shock to Sonny&#x27;s system. Gwen tearfully pushes her way through the gathering crowd as the chief engineer extracts Sonny from the car. Sonny slowly comes out of his daze and takes Gwen in his arms.

As Sonny, Ski, Gwen, Cully and Jocko view the bridge lying in the river and the gorge the rocket car had jumped, Roger comes up to them and tries to apologize for all the grief he gave him during filming, but he comes off as trying to justify himself. Sonny&#x27;s response is to knock Roger out with a single punch. He, Gwen, Ski, Cully and Jocko then triumphantly walk off the set.

==Production==
The film was initially called &quot;The Stuntman&quot; and Reynolds committed to the film early and inexpensively. Lamont Johnson was originally due to direct in 1975. However, the project was shelved in 1976 after the Motion Picture Association of America ruled in an arbitration suit filed by director Richard Rush that its title was too similar to his planned film &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; (1980). Reynolds also quit the project in order to focus on his next films &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977) and &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; (1977).

The project was reactivated in 1977 under the title &quot;Hollywood Stuntman&quot; with Hal Needham as director and with Lawrence Gordon joining later as executive producer. Reynolds, who had been interested in the film because he started his acting career as a stuntman, also rejoined the film in order to fulfill his contract with Warner Bros. Principal photography on the film began on January 31, 1978, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. However, in March 1978 Rush filed another MPAA appeal forcing Warner Bros. to change the title of the film to Hooper.

It was rumored that the Roger Deal character in the film was a send-up of Peter Bogdanovich, who had made two films with Reynolds.

The &quot;destruction of Los Angeles&quot; sequence that concludes both &quot;The Spy Who Laughed at Danger&quot; and &quot;Hooper&quot; was filmed in the Tuscaloosa, Alabama area, with all but the final rocket car jump staged at the by-that-time-disused Northington General Hospital, a World War II military hospital near the University of Alabama. The huge stunt sequence was referred to by the crew as &quot;Damnation Alley.&quot;

The rocket car jump took place on US Highway 78E between Sumiton, Alabama. and Graysville, Alabama over the Locust Fork River (Lat.33°42&#x27;17.84&quot;N Long. 86°59&#x27;33.74&quot;W). The bridge was in the process of being demolished due to damage from a traffic accident involving a fuel truck.

==Reception==
&quot;Hooper&quot; enjoyed success at the box office being one of the top ten films of 1978, but ultimately the film was deemed a letdown in comparison to Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, second only to &quot;Star Wars&quot; in box office gross the year before. &quot;Hooper&quot; opened in 97 theaters and grossed $1,049,831 in its opening week. It expanded to 454 theaters and grossed $4,614,456 the following week before expanding again to 849 theaters and grossing $9,437,484. After 70 days of release, &quot;Hooper&quot; had grossed $55 million. It was withdrawn from release by year end having earned Warners&#x27; rentals of $31.5 million. The film was reissued in May 1979 and earned Warners a further $3.4 million bringing its rental to $34.9 million and its gross to $78 million in the United States and Canada, nearly 40% less than the gross of &quot;Smokey&quot; in 1977 ($126 million). The film has a score of 63% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews.

Janet Maslin wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Mr. Reynolds is one of the most effortlessly appealing movie stars around, but consolidating his following has always been a problem: There are fans who like to watch him tearing up the highway, and there are fans who enjoy his delightfully flippant self-mockery, with all the covert thoughtfulness it implies. This time, Mr. Reynolds has made a movie to please fans of all persuasions, and to please them a great deal.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the work of the four lead performers was &quot;a delight&quot; that &quot;boosts an otherwise pedestrian story with lots of crashes and daredevil antics into a touching and likeable piece.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, &quot;None of this makes very much sense. But sense is not the point in Reynolds-Needham films. Just thrills, spills, and Reynolds&#x27; leer. That&#x27;s proving to be one of the most potent combinations in today&#x27;s film industry.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the &quot;excellent&quot; script, &quot;inspired &quot; casting, and direction by Needham that &quot;brings such affection and amiability to the film that its people seem real even when what they&#x27;re doing is patently fake—not in their awesome stunts but rather in their off-hours shenanigans.&quot; David Ansen wrote in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Hooper&#x27; doesn&#x27;t dig very deep into its Hollywood subject, but it&#x27;s a good example of decent, no-frills filmmaking that lets a surprising amount of feeling seep through the cracks of its all-action formula.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a rousing and sweet-tempered sentimental comedy&quot; that &quot;should finally secure Reynolds a preeminent position in the affections of contemporary moviegoers.&quot; Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was less enthused, calling the film &quot;trite&quot; and containing &quot;frolicsome humor that is not contagious.&quot;

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound (Robert Knudson, Robert Glass, Don MacDougall and Jack Solomon).

==&quot;Blooper reel&quot; credits==
&quot;Hooper&quot; was also one of the first films to make use of the blooper reel credit roll. The technique showed a smaller screen of outtakes from the film to one side while the film&#x27;s credits roll slowly up the other side. Needham refined this technique for later films such as &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;, &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; and the &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; films. (In &quot;Hooper&quot; the credit reel was mostly a montage of many of the stunts performed in the film itself, owing to the film&#x27;s tribute to the stunt industry.) This technique was later used in other films, including the animated &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, for which the bloopers were intentionally created, and in TV series including &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; and &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Most of Jackie Chan&#x27;s films also feature blooper reel credit rolls, due to his experience in &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;.

<text>Canadian nationality law details the conditions by which a person is a national of Canada. The primary law governing these regulations is the Citizenship Act, which came into force on February 15, 1977 and is applicable to all provinces and territories of Canada.

With few exceptions, almost all individuals born in the country are automatically citizens at birth. Foreign nationals may naturalize after living in Canada for at least three years while holding permanent residence and showing proficiency in the English or French language.

Canada is composed of several former British colonies whose residents were British subjects. After Confederation into a Dominion within the British Empire in 1867, Canada was granted more autonomy over time and gradually became independent from the United Kingdom. Before 1947, Canadians were seen as British subjects. The Canadian Citizenship Act started on 1 January 1947, defining people as Canadian. Although Canadian citizens have not been British subjects since 1977, they continue to enjoy certain privileges in UK immigration law. As Commonwealth citizens, Canadians may both vote in British elections, and serve in public office there, including as MPs.

== History ==
=== Fragmented development ===

European settlement of North America began with the arrival of the first colonists from England and France in the 16th century. The rival empires competed to expand their territorial control until British victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War and annexation of French Canada in 1763. Despite the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, British presence on the continent continued to expand through the 19th century, often in contest with the United States as the two powers raced to settle the Pacific Northwest. British nationality law applied to the North American colonies, as was the case elsewhere in the British Empire. Residents of these colonies and all other imperial citizens were British subjects; any person born in British North America, the United Kingdom, or anywhere else within Crown dominions was a natural-born British subject.

British nationality law during this time was uncodified and did not have a standard set of regulations, relying instead on precedent and common law. Until the mid-19th century, it was unclear whether naturalization rules in the United Kingdom were applicable in other parts of the Empire. Each colony had wide discretion in developing their own procedures and requirements for admitting foreign settlers as subjects.

Naturalization in Britain was achieved through individual Acts of Parliament until 1844, when a more streamlined administrative process was introduced. The North American colonies emulated this system in their own naturalization legislation, which was enacted in all local legislatures by 1868. In 1847, the Imperial Parliament formalised a clear distinction between subjects who naturalized in the UK and those who did so in other territories. Individuals who naturalized in the UK were deemed to have received the status by imperial naturalization, which was valid throughout the Empire. Those naturalizing in colonies were said to have gone through local naturalization and were given subject status valid only within the relevant territory; a subject who locally naturalized in British Columbia was a British subject there, but not in England or New Zealand. Nevertheless, locally naturalized British subjects were still entitled to imperial protection when travelling outside of the Empire.

Married women generally followed the nationality status of their husbands. Upper Canada enacted local legislation in 1849 that automatically naturalized foreign women who married British subjects, mirroring regulations enacted in the UK in 1844. After Britain established marital denaturalization for British subject women who married non-British men in 1870, Canada adapted its rules to match this in 1881. The 1870 regulations provided that any British subject who acquired a foreign nationality automatically lost subject status.

=== Post-confederation policies ===
On July 1, 1867, three British North American colonies (the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia) united to form the Dominion of Canada. The status of Canadians as British subjects remained unchanged despite the creation of this federation. Federal nationality legislation enacted in 1868 superseded laws of the new provinces; naturalization in one of the provinces became automatically valid in all of them. Foreigners were able to naturalize as British subjects in Canada after residing in the Dominion for at least three years, fulfilling a good character requirement, and swearing an oath of allegiance. By 1880, Britain had transferred all of its remaining North American territory to Canada except Newfoundland Colony, which became a separate Dominion in 1907.

The first law defining a &quot;Canadian citizen&quot; is the Immigration Act, 1910. A citizen under this definition did not hold a substantive Canadian citizenship and the term was only a label for those who had the right to enter and remain in Canada; Canadians continued to be British subjects. Under the Act, a Canadian &quot;citizen&quot; was any person born in Canada who had not denaturalized, a British subject domiciled in Canada for at least three years, or an individual naturalized in Canada who had not since lost British subject status and remained permanently resident in the Dominion.

==== Discriminatory policies against Asian migrants ====
Chinese immigration to Canada began in the 1850s during the British Columbia gold rushes. Growing hostility and anti-Chinese sentiment led to a concerted movement within the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia to restrict Chinese immigration. The provincial legislature attempted to discourage this migration with the Chinese Regulation Act of 1884, imposing an annual $10 fee on every Chinese person resident in the province and a $100 fine on recreational opium use. However, the law was struck down by the Supreme Court of British Columbia for legislating on issues beyond the scope of the provincial government. Laws directly restricting Chinese immigration were passed by the legislature in 1884 and 1885 but similarly struck down by orders in council. Fearing open violence if the situation were to continue, the federal government enacted the Chinese Immigration Act, 1885, which limited the number of Chinese migrants who could land in Canada to one per 50 tons of cargo and imposed a $50 head tax on every Chinese person who entered the Dominion. These measures also applied to British subjects of Chinese ancestry, but not those who were already resident in Canada. The entrance tax was increased to $100 in 1900 and to $500 in 1903.

When Japanese migrants started entering British Columbia in large numbers beginning in 1901, the local legislature attempted to legislate restrictions on this movement, but these measures were again struck down by the federal government in 1902, 1905, and 1907. Treaty obligations stemming from the Anglo-Japanese Alliance made total restriction impossible but the Dominion was able to limit Japanese migration to Canada in most cases with agreement from the Japanese government. Only individuals with government-approved work contracts, agricultural laborers for Japanese-owned farms, returning residents, and domestic workers for Japanese residents would be allowed entry.

Migration from India was also limited beginning in 1908, despite the fact that Indians were British subjects. Any person who landed in Canada from a country other than that of their birth or citizenship could be denied entry into the Dominion. Because there was no direct steamship service from India, this measure directly limited persons from India. Similar measures were created targeting British subjects from Hong Kong. All &quot;Asiatic immigrants&quot; were required beginning in 1908 to hold at least $200 of currency to enter Canada. The 1910 Immigration Act further enabled the federal government to limit the entrance of &quot;immigrants belonging to any race deemed unsuited to the climate or requirements of Canada&quot;.

=== Imperial common code ===
The Imperial Parliament brought regulations for British subject status into codified statute law for the first time with passage of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914. British subject status was standardised as a common nationality across the Empire. Dominions that adopted this Act as part of local legislation were authorised to grant subject status to aliens by imperial naturalization. A Dominion could define a citizenship for its own citizens, although that status would only be effective within the local Dominion&#x27;s borders. Canada adopted the common code in 1914, and Newfoundland in 1916.

The 1914 regulations codified the doctrine of coverture into imperial nationality law, where a woman&#x27;s consent to marry a foreign national was also assumed to be intent to denaturalise; British women who married foreign men automatically lost their British nationality. There were two exceptions to this: a wife married to a husband who lost his British subject status was able to retain British nationality by declaration, and a British-born widow or divorcée who had lost her British nationality through marriage could reacquire that status without meeting residence requirements after the dissolution of her marriage. Minor children whose parents voluntarily lost British subject status by renunciation or acquiring a foreign nationality were considered to have automatically British nationality as well, but could resume their status as British subjects by declaration within one year of reaching age 21.

Canada became an independent member of the League of Nations and the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1920. Each country was able to nominate a candidate to be a judge on this court. It would have been possible for a successful Canadian candidate, as a British subject, to be turned down from the court if a British subject from Australia or another part of the Empire was also selected as a judge. The Canadian Nationals Act, 1921 was enacted to allow Canada to differentiate its own nationals in international bodies. Under this law, a Canadian national was any British subject who qualified as a Canadian citizen under the Immigration Act, 1910.

By the end of the First World War, the Dominions had exercised increasing levels of autonomy in managing their own affairs and each by then had developed a distinct national identity. Britain formally recognised this at the 1926 Imperial Conference, jointly issuing the Balfour Declaration with all the Dominion heads of government, which stated that the United Kingdom and Dominions were autonomous and equal to each other within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Full legislative independence was granted to the Dominions with passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931.

Women&#x27;s rights groups throughout the Empire pressured the imperial government during this time to amend nationality regulations that tied a married woman&#x27;s status to that of her husband. Because the British government could no longer enforce legislative supremacy over the Dominions after 1931 and wanted to maintain a strong constitutional link to them through the common nationality code, it was unwilling to make major changes without unanimous agreement among the Dominions on this issue, which it did not have. Imperial legal uniformity was nevertheless eroded during the 1930s; New Zealand and Australia amended their laws in 1935 and 1936 to allow women denaturalized by marriage to retain their rights as British subjects, and Ireland changed its regulations in 1935 to cause no change to a woman&#x27;s nationality after her marriage. Canada partially reformed its rules on martial denaturalization in 1932; women who had not acquired foreign nationality on marriage were permitted to retain their British nationality.

=== Canadian citizenship created ===

Following the Second World War, growing assertions of local national identity separate from that of Britain and the Empire led the Canadian government to develop a new substantive citizenship status based on a purely Canadian idea of nationhood. This was created with passage of the Canadian Citizenship Act, 1946, which came into force on January 1, 1947. All British subjects who were born, naturalized, or resident for at least five years in Canada automatically acquired Canadian citizenship on that date. British subjects born to a father who himself was born or naturalized in Canada. Women no longer automatically took the nationality of their husbands when they married, but any British subject woman who was already married to someone qualifying as a Canadian citizen when the 1946 Act came into force automatically acquired citizenship on that date. Minor children born overseas to a Canadian father or unmarried Canadian mother who had already been admitted into Canada also automatically became Canadian citizens. All citizens of Canada and any other Commonwealth country remained defined as British subjects under this Act. The Act later became applicable in Newfoundland when it joined Canada in 1949.

All other noncitizens could acquire citizenship by naturalization after fulfilling a general residence requirement and demonstrating proficiency in English or French. Candidates must have continuously resided in Canada for one year immediately preceding an application. Wives of Canadian citizens had no further residence requirement, but all other applicants were additionally required to have been resident in the country for at least four of the preceding six years, for a total requisite period of five years. Applicants who had been domiciled in Canada for at least 20 years were exempted from the language requirement. Successful completion of the naturalization process was dependent on the outcome of an interview with a citizenship judge to verify an applicant&#x27;s background and fulfillment of the citizenship requirements. Non-local British subjects applying for naturalization were not subject to this judicial requirement.

==== Provisions for automatic loss of citizenship ====
Children born abroad to a Canadian father or unmarried Canadian mother after the 1946 Act came into force were eligible to became Canadian citizens, provided that their births were registered at a Canadian diplomatic mission within two years. On reaching age 21, these individuals were required to make a formal declaration of their intention to retain Canadian citizenship within one year. If they had acquired nationality of another country by birth or at any point as a minor, they were also required to renounce their other nationalities. Eligible minor children who had not already lawfully entered Canada when the Act became effective were subject to the same conditions for retaining Canadian citizenship on reaching age 21. The time limit to make a declaration of citizenship retention was later extended from one year to three years, before an applicable person&#x27;s 24th birthday. Alternatively, they would also remain citizens if they were domiciled in Canada on reaching age 24.

Canadian citizens residing overseas who voluntarily acquired a foreign nationality other than through marriage automatically lost their Canadian citizenship. Canadians who became foreign nationals by marriage, who held another nationality by birth, or had otherwise become foreign nationals as minors could retain Canadian citizenship unless they made a formal declaration of renunciation. The 1946 Act further contained extensive measures for revoking citizenship from Canadians who were not natural-born. Individuals who became domiciled outside of Canada for six years, showed disloyalty to the monarch, obtained naturalization through fraudulent means, or traded with an enemy nation during a time of war were liable to have their citizenship revoked. Honorably discharged former service members of the Canadian Armed Forces were exempt from the six-year overseas residence limit. The maximum period of absence from Canada was extended to 10 years in the 1950s and later repealed in 1967.

=== Reform and abolition of British subject status ===
The creation of Canadian citizenship unilaterally broke the system of a common imperial nationality. Combined with the approaching independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, comprehensive reform to imperial nationality law was necessary at this point to address ideas that were incompatible with the previous system. The British Nationality Act 1948 abolished the common code and each Commonwealth country would enact legislation to create its own nationality. British subject was redefined to mean any citizen of a Commonwealth country. Commonwealth citizen is defined in this Act to have the same meaning. British subject/Commonwealth citizen status co-existed with the citizenships of each Commonwealth country. The change in naming indicated a shift in the base idea of British subject status; allegiance to the Crown was no longer a requirement to possess the common status, which would be maintained by voluntary agreement among the various members of the Commonwealth. Irish citizens were treated as if they were British subjects, despite Ireland&#x27;s exit from the Commonwealth in 1949.

All British subjects under the reformed system initially held an automatic right to settle in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Non-white immigration into the UK was systemically discouraged, but strong economic conditions in Britain following the Second World War attracted an unprecedented wave of colonial migration. In response, the British Parliament imposed immigration controls on any subjects originating from outside the British Islands with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. Ireland had continued to allow all British subjects free movement despite independence in 1922 as part of the Common Travel Area arrangement, but moved to mirror Britain&#x27;s restriction in 1962 by limiting this ability only to people born on the islands of Great Britain or Ireland. Britain somewhat relaxed these measures in 1971 for patrials, subjects whose parents or grandparents were born in the United Kingdom, which gave effective preferential treatment to white Commonwealth citizens.

As a sign of Canada&#x27;s changing relationship with Britain, British subjects lost voting eligibility for federal elections in 1975. Provincial governments progressively phased out this entitlement until it was fully abolished in 2006. Preferences that were afforded to non-local British subjects in the naturalization process were abolished in 1977. British subject status itself was removed from Canadian law in that year as well, although Canadians and citizens from other Commonwealth countries remain defined as Commonwealth citizens.

By the 1970s and 1980s, most colonies of the British Empire had become independent and remaining ties to the United Kingdom had been significantly weakened. The UK itself updated its nationality law to reflect the more modest boundaries of its remaining territory and possessions with the British Nationality Act 1981, which redefined British subject to no longer also mean Commonwealth citizen. Canadian citizens remain Commonwealth citizens in British law and are still eligible to vote and stand for public office in the UK.

=== Expanding access to citizenship ===
The Citizenship Act 1977 expanded the available pathways to citizenship and allowed more situations to retain it. The retention requirement was abolished for individuals born overseas to natural-born or naturalized Canadians, and any applicable person who had not yet reached age 24 at that point was no longer required to make a declaration of retention; individuals born after February 1953 have not been subject to this requirement. Births overseas also no longer needed to be registered within two years to maintain eligibility for Canadian citizenship. However, persons born abroad to Canadian parents who themselves were born abroad became subject to a retention requirement before age 28. The general residence requirement for acquiring citizenship was reduced to three years and remaining gender imbalances were removed from nationality regulations; citizenship has been transferrable by descent to children through mothers as well as fathers regardless of marital status since 1977. Additionally, automatic denaturalisation of Canadians acquiring foreign nationalities was repealed.

As part of a 1988 agreement with the Japanese Canadian community in compensation for their internment during the Second World War, any individual of Japanese ancestry who was expelled from Canada or had their citizenship revoked between 1941 and 1949 was eligible for a special restoration of citizenship. This right to citizenship also extended to the descendants of applicable persons. The requirement for an interview with a citizenship judge in the naturalization process was largely replaced by the Canadian Citizenship Test in 1995. Applicants who failed this test are still required to be interviewed by a judge, although the rate of successfully passing the test is over 90 percent.

Naturalization requirements became more stringent in 2014, after passage of the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act. The general residence requirement was increased to a minimum of four of the preceding six years and applicants became required to be physically present in Canada for at least 183 days per year. The age range for candidates mandated to take citizenship and language tests was broadened to include all individuals aged 14 to 64 (previously 18 to 54) and the language requirement itself became stricter. While candidates were previously screened for language knowledge through their ability to pass the citizenship test, naturalization candidates became required to attain a level 4 rating in a Canadian Language Benchmark evaluation.

==== Restoration of involuntarily lost citizenship ====
When the 1977 Act was enacted, a provision was included that allowed children born abroad to unmarried Canadian mothers (but not fathers) who had not had their births registered within two years an extension to that deadline to register as Canadian citizens. In the 2004 Federal Court case &quot;Augier v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)&quot;, it was ruled that the exclusion of children born to unmarried Canadian fathers infringed upon rights of equality granted by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Individuals born abroad to unmarried Canadian fathers before 1977 could apply for citizenship during a limited application period that ended on August 14, 2004. Citizenship granted through this process was not retroactive from birth and was only applicable from the date it was granted.

Following the 2007 implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, Canadian citizens became required to hold Canadian passports when crossing the Canada–United States border. When applying for passports, a large number of individuals who believed themselves to be citizens discovered that they did not actually hold Canadian citizenship due to previous provisions concerning automatic loss under the 1946 Act. Legislation enacted in 2009 addressed this issue by restoring citizenship to specific categories of individuals who had involuntarily lost that status. This group of affected people became known as the Lost Canadians. Citizenship was restored to any person who: had naturalized as a Canadian citizen but resided overseas for more than 10 years before 1967, had acquired foreign nationality through their own or a parent&#x27;s naturalization, had been born abroad to an applicable parent (married Canadian father or unmarried Canadian mother) before 1977 and did not have their birth registered with Canadian authorities or failed to apply for citizenship retention before age 24, or had been born abroad to a Canadian parent who themself was born abroad after 1977 but failed to apply for retention before age 28. Any person born abroad to a Canadian parent in the second or subsequent generations after the 1977 Act came into force but had not yet reached age 28 on 17 April 2009 was able to retain Canadian citizenship without application. However, citizenship has not been transferrable by descent past the first generation born abroad since that date.

Further changes became effective in 2015 that granted Canadian citizenship to certain groups of individuals who had never become citizens and their descendants. Canadian citizenship was granted to individuals who: were born or naturalized in Canada but lost British subject status before the 1946 Act came into force, were non-local British subjects ordinarily resident in Canada but did not qualify as Canadian citizens when that status was created, were born outside Canada in the first generation to a parent in either of the preceding categories, were born outside Canada in the first generation to a parent who did become a Canadian citizen when the 1946 Act became effective but who themself did not acquire citizenship, or were a foreign-born adoptee who was adopted before 1947 by a parent who became a Canadian citizen and who qualified to pass citizenship by descent. Any person who voluntarily renounced British subject status or had it revoked did not qualify to receive citizenship by this special grant.

== Acquisition and loss of citizenship ==
=== Entitlement by birth, descent, or adoption ===
Nearly all individuals born in Canada receive Canadian citizenship by birth, including those who were born in Canadian airspace, internal and territorial waters, and Canadian-registered ships and aircraft. The only exceptions are children born to two foreign parents with at least one who is employed by a foreign government, an employee of a foreign government, or an organization with diplomatic immunity. Abandoned children found before the age of seven are assumed to have been born in Canada, unless contrary evidence is found within seven years of discovery.

Children born overseas are Canadian citizens by descent if either parent is a citizen otherwise than by descent (meaning by birth in Canada or naturalization). Citizenship by descent is limited to only one generation born outside of the country, other than children or grandchildren of members of the Canadian Armed Forces. Adopted children are treated as if they were naturally born to the adopting parents and are subject to the same regulations regarding birthplace and descent.

=== Naturalization ===
Foreign permanent residents or status Indians over the age of 18 may become Canadian citizens by grant after residing in Canada for more than three years. Candidates must be physically present in the country for at least 1,095 days during the five-year period immediately preceding their applications. This requirement may be partially met by time spent within the country before acquiring permanent residency; applicants may count each day within the preceding five-year period that they were present in Canada as a temporary resident or protected person as half a day of physical presence for this condition, up to a maximum of 365 days.

Applicants must have filed income taxes for three of the preceding five years, and those between the ages of 18 and 54 must additionally demonstrate proficiency in either the English or French language and pass the Canadian Citizenship Test. Minor children under the age of 18 who have a Canadian parent or are naturalizing at the same time as a parent are not required to fulfill the physical presence or tax filing requirements, but those applying separately are subject to those conditions. Successful applicants over the age of 14 are required to take an oath of citizenship.

Permanent residents in the Canadian Armed Forces may alternatively fulfill the physical presence requirement with 1,095 days of completed military service during the preceding six-year period. Foreign military servicemembers attached to the CAF with an equivalent amount of completed service time are exempt from holding permanent residence or filing income taxes. Stateless individuals under the age of 23 who were born overseas to at least one parent with Canadian citizenship after 17 April 2009 and meet the 1,095-day physical presence requirement for a four-year period may also be granted citizenship.

The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship has discretionary power to waive language and citizenship test requirements for any candidates in compassionate circumstances, and the citizenship oath requirement for applicants with mental disabilities. The Minister also may grant citizenship extraordinarily without any requirements to persons who are stateless, subject to &quot;special and unusual hardship&quot;, or have made exceptional contributions to the country. These atypical grants have been conferred more than 500 times since 1977, often on athletes competing for Canada internationally. The Parliament of Canada occasionally bestows honorary Canadian citizenship on exceptional foreigners, but this distinction is symbolic and does not grant awarded individuals substantive rights in Canada.

Before 2015, the physical presence requirement was 1,095 days within a four-year period. Between 17 June 2015 and 11 October 2017, this was extended to 1,460 days within a six-year period, with an additional presence requirement of 183 days per year in four of those six years. Time spent within the country as a non-permanent resident was not counted toward the stricter presence requirements. The age range of applicants subject to language and citizenship tests during this regulatory period was between the ages of 14 and 65.

=== Renunciation and revocation ===
Canadian citizenship can be relinquished by applying for renunciation, provided that the applicant already possesses or will possess another nationality. Individuals who automatically acquired citizenship in 2009 or 2015 because of amendments to nationality law in those years have a special route for renunciation that only requires that they are citizens of another country and costs no fees.

Former citizens who renounced their nationality may subsequently apply for nationality restoration, after reacquiring permanent residency and being physically present in Canada for at least 365 days during the two-year period preceding their applications. They must also have filed income taxes for the prior year. Individuals who had their citizenships revoked are ineligible for nationality resumption and must follow the naturalization process instead.

Citizenship may be revoked from individuals who fraudulently acquired it, and renunciations may be similarly rescinded from persons who provided false information during that process. The Federal Court holds decision-making power for all revocation cases, except where the individual in question specifically requests the IRCC Minister to make that decision. Additionally, between 28 May 2015 and 19 June 2017, Canadians holding another citizenship who were convicted of treason or terrorism were liable for potential citizenship revocation.

==Canadian royal family==
Although the King of Canada primarily resides in the United Kingdom, the sovereign is the physical embodiment of the Canadian state, and is therefore considered Canadian. Members of the royal family are personal subjects of the Canadian monarch and not foreigners for the purpose of diplomatic or military protocol, but they fall within the definition of a foreign national unless they acquired Canadian citizenship or permanent residence and there is no legal provision that grants them automatic citizenship or permanent residence. The King and other royal family members have occasionally described Canada as &quot;home&quot; and themselves as Canadian.

<doc id="617074" wikidata="Q834397" url="?curid=617074" title="Impossible Princess">
<text>Impossible Princess (briefly retitled Kylie Minogue in Europe) is the sixth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, released on 22 October 1997, by Deconstruction, BMG and Mushroom Records. The singer asserted greater creative control over the project — writing every song on the album and producing material for the first time — compared to her previous work, assisted by Brothers in Rhythm, Manic Street Preachers, David Ball and Rob Dougan. Influenced by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s, sonically, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; is a departure from Minogue&#x27;s previous work. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from dance music, including trip hop, electronica, and rock. Lyrically, the album focuses on Minogue&#x27;s self-discovery after a series of trips worldwide and delves into freedom of expression, relationships, and emotions.

Upon its release, critical and public reception of &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; was divided over its new musical direction and Minogue&#x27;s intimate lyrics. Commercially, the album reached the top 10 in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom; the British media, however, mocked its lack of success in Europe. Four singles were released from the album, including two UK top-20 entries &quot;Did It Again&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot;. Minogue embarked on the Intimate and Live tour in 1998 to support the album.

In retrospect, music commentators have praised &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; as Minogue&#x27;s most personal and misunderstood work. The album has been noted to have a cult following amongst fans after various retrospective re-evaluations of the album. To celebrate 25 years since the album&#x27;s original release, it was released on vinyl for the first time in October 2022, leading to its resurgence and reaching new peaks on record charts.

==Background==
Minogue left her label PWL in 1992 because of creative differences and signed a three-album deal with Deconstruction Records the following year. She worked with a diverse group of collaborators to experiment with different sounds, including the British duo Brothers in Rhythm. Their first offering was Minogue&#x27;s self-titled album in late 1994, which peaked at number three in Australia and number four in the United Kingdom. Besides promotional commitments for the album, Minogue expanded her acting career by taking part in several projects. Among them were big-budget films &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1994) and &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; (1996), which were received poorly by critics. Minogue worked with Australian musician Nick Cave and his band, the Bad Seeds on their 1995 single &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot;, which peaked at number two in Australia and number eleven in the UK. The song earned three ARIA Awards for Best Pop Release, Single, and Song of the Year in 1996.

Minogue&#x27;s friendship with Cave continued over the years; on Cave&#x27;s advice, Minogue recited the lyrics to her 1987 song &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; as poetry at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in July 1996. In December, she made a surprise appearance at a Manic Street Preachers concert at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, singing &quot;Little Baby Nothing&quot; with them. The track was planned initially as a duet with Minogue but did not materialise during her years under contract with PWL. Both 1996 live performances were viewed as the starting point of her new alter ego, &quot;IndieKylie&quot;, a pseudonym that dealt with Minogue&#x27;s move to rock music. Minogue began a romantic relationship with French photographer Stéphane Sednaoui and embarked on a series of trips with him throughout North America, Asia, and Australasia to gain inspiration for her upcoming record. By the end of the trip, Minogue was enamoured by the experience and felt &quot;truly anonymous and free to be [herself]&quot;.

==Recording and development==

Plans for &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; began in mid-1995 after meetings with Brothers in Rhythm had taken place and recording the album began. By June 1997, the album had been in production for twenty-one months, and Deconstruction were adding the final touches to it. The album took nearly two years to record—the longest period Minogue had worked on a project since her time acting on the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; (from 1986 to 1988). Many changes of direction, remixes and cowriters lengthened the process which at times upset and infuriated Minogue. Brothers in Rhythm member Steve Anderson explained this was &quot;due to the pure perfectionism&quot; of everyone involved; Minogue felt the album was worth the wait.

Minogue&#x27;s trips with Sednaoui, her Deconstruction label mates, and clients of Sednaoui&#x27;s work including Björk, Garbage, and Tricky inspired the album. Sednaoui and Cave were key factors during the production. In the biography &quot;Kylie&quot; (2014), Sean Smith notes Sednaoui had a huge effect on Minogue&#x27;s belief in herself and contributed to her vision of the future, while Cave helped her to embrace the past. Minogue began writing lyrics after Sednaoui and Cave convinced her to take creative control over her next musical project. She wrote every track on the album—in contrast, she co-wrote only one song on her 1994 studio album. She did not have any specific method for writing: she wrote constantly in her notebook and composed many songs during the holidays. &quot;Cowboy Style&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot; were among the earliest songs Minogue wrote for the album; the lyrics and melodies came easily to her. Minogue imagined performing &quot;Too Far&quot; while working on its lyrics, which she did at a local cafe. She found the track easy to write and did not sound like anything she had written before. She wanted to put herself into the album as much as possible, and felt the songs were more personal: &quot;I&#x27;ve written lyrics before, but they&#x27;ve been safe–just neatly rhymed words and that&#x27;s that. Now I have songs in which, from beginning to end, I don&#x27;t want another word, I don&#x27;t want a word removed,&quot; Minogue said.

===Sessions with Brothers in Rhythm===
Brothers in Rhythm put together a few songs initially planned for &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; but scrapped them because Minogue had started writing and they saw she had development as an artist. In order to work closely with Brothers in Rhythm, Minogue shared a house with them across the road from the Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, where each morning she would present a set of lyrics from the night before to Brothers in Rhythm producer Dave Seaman. Minogue then sang her ideas for the melody to the duo who tried to compose the backing tracks, find a suitable style, record rough demos, and add subtle lyric and melody ideas to each of them. Production took place mainly at Real World, where the rough demos were rearranged. Strings were added at Sarm West Studios in London, and the tracks were then sent back to Real World for the final mixes, handled by engineer Alan Bremner.

From those sessions, Brothers in Rhythm developed five more songs that ended up on the final tracklist: &quot;Did It Again&quot;, &quot;Limbo&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Say Hey&quot;, and &quot;Cowboy Style&quot;. &quot;Too Far&quot; was written at Sarm West, where Anderson came up with the piano line on the final version. According to Anderson, the production grew as the song was created, and many ideas on the demos made it onto the finished tracks. &quot;Limbo&quot;, &quot;Too Far&quot;, &quot;Did It Again&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Style&quot;, were released in their original demo form because Minogue felt the rawness of the tracks worked better than being polished. Anderson considered &quot;Too Far&quot; and &quot;Drunk&quot; to be the examples of Minogue&#x27;s artistic progression, and her poetry lyrics were different from standard pop song structure. Pete Hadfield, the label&#x27;s director, was ill, leaving Minogue to take partial creative control over the project. To help produce the album, she attended each session with Anderson and Seaman to learn about composing, arranging instruments, and distorting sections of the album&#x27;s tracks. As a result, she is credited as a co-producer with Brothers in Rhythm on the songs &quot;Too Far&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, and &quot;Say Hey&quot;; she played the synthesizer and provided backing vocals.

===Other collaborations===

Deconstruction encouraged Minogue to work with other artists, besides her sessions with Brothers in Rhythm, to produce enough potential tracks to release as singles. Like she had done on her 1994 album, Minogue was open to the idea of experimenting her sounds with different producers. She wrote &quot;Through The Years&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, and &quot;Limbo&quot; during her sessions with the electronic producers Dave Ball and Ingo Vauk at their home studios; Minogue wrote the lyrics to &quot;Through the Years&quot; within 10 minutes of hearing Ball and Vauk&#x27;s track. Minogue had heard of Rob Dougan&#x27;s work and thought that it would be interesting to work with him; they wrote and produced &quot;Jump&quot;. She worked on two songs with English band Olive, but they were scrapped. Cave wrote a track for the album based on Minogue&#x27;s lyrics, entitled &quot;Soon&quot;, but she was disappointed with her recording and dropped it.

Minogue said that James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers had a clear idea of how he wanted her to sound during their first session at his home. Minogue found it difficult to re-write Bradfield&#x27;s demo of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anyone&quot;, so he had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written, with help from Nicky Wire, to create the finished version of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anyone&quot;. She found this method of writing interesting and did it again with Bradfield and Sean Moore on &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot;. She felt the lyrics worked together, and was pleased with the final result. Bradfield and frequent collaborator Dave Eringa produced both tracks.

==Musical styles==
Musically, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; experiments and blends different musical styles, as Minogue wanted the album to reflect her many sides. It is a departure from her previous sound, encompassing various elements from dance music. Music critics commented on the album&#x27;s musical diversity. Marcel Anders of &quot;Orkus&quot;, and Nick Levine at Digital Spy labelled it a dance record, while a writer from &quot;Who&quot; magazine wrote the album ranges from trip hop, torch songs to scratchy guitar pop, and disco tracks. &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; writers pointed out trance, rock, and alternative influences, and described the album as &quot;something you would expect Björk to make&quot;. Michael Dwyer of &quot;The West Australian&quot; found the club-oriented production made the album standout. Chris True of AllMusic and Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; identified the record as part of the electronica and Britpop movements that spanned the mid-to-late 1990s.
&quot;Impossible Princess&quot; incorporates live instrumental tracks, such as a trumpet solo by English trumpeter Guy Barker on &quot;Through the Years&quot;. Minogue found this unusual because she was familiar only with the use of synthesizers on her tracks, and considered the album a mixture between synthetics and real instruments. The album contains several guitar-driven songs, such as &quot;Did It Again&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anyone&quot;. &quot;Did It Again&quot; blends drums and electric guitar, which Smith found similar to the sound of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966). &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anyone&quot; is a rock song heavily influenced by Middle Eastern beats. Moore played drums and Bradfield played guitars on the joyful Britpop-style tracks &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anyone&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot;. Critics compared the latter track to Motown music and the work of Manic Street Preachers.

&quot;Cowboy Style&quot; is a country number that was influenced by Celtic music and tribal percussion. Ian Phillips of &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; wrote that the orchestral pop ballad &quot;Dreams&quot; uses a mixture of eerie-sounding strings, booming bass, and drums. Cinquemani described the chaotic drum and bass &quot;Too Far&quot; as a blend of crisp breakbeats, a Moby-style piano progression and lush strings; &quot;Drunk&quot; as a trance song; and &quot;Limbo&quot; as a hybrid between rock and techno in the style of The Chemical Brothers. &quot;Jump&quot; is a dark trip hop track, while &quot;Say Hey&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; are subtle electronic-infused songs. &quot;Through the Years&quot; contains muted horns, experimental vocal tracks and mournful lyrics; Cinquemani compared it to Björk&#x27;s 1993 single &quot;Venus as a Boy&quot;.

The record&#x27;s vocals feature segments of spoken word and rapping, alongside whispering and singing. John Mangan of Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper felt the songs were tailored-made for her voice. A writer from &quot;Who&quot; noted Minogue was developing her own voice on the album, saying she is &quot;whispering breathlessly one moment, shrieking like a young Sinéad O&#x27;Connor the next&quot;. Another writer from the same publication felt that Minogue &quot;never sounded more human&quot;, with many songs showcasing her unique phrasing. In the biography &quot;Kylie: Naked&quot; (2012), Nigel Goodall and Jenny Stanley-Clarke likened Minogue&#x27;s vocals to those of Tori Amos, Björk, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Kate Bush and Madonna. Cinquemani and Dwyer also compared Minogue&#x27;s seductive delivery to Madonna, and described her vocals as a &quot;sexy [and] reliable secret weapon&quot;. Larry Flick of &quot;Billboard&quot; commented that Minogue had dropped the pitch-perfect vocals and let her &quot;odd noises flow freely&quot; on the album.

==Themes==
&quot;Impossible Princess&quot; deals with the theme of romantic relationships, self-discovery, emotional pain and freedom of expression. Critics and Dave Seaman noted that Minogue&#x27;s personal input was more significant on this album. Most of the album is autobiographical, based upon Minogue&#x27;s life during the two years preceding the album. Sean Smith believed the songs reveal her life more than any interview, as they were more &quot;complex, serious, introspective and challenging&quot; than the songs on her previous albums. Minogue discuss her paranoia, pain and anger in &quot;Too Far&quot;, in which she sings in a quick, rambling way about suffering from claustrophobia. Negative stories that the British press had published about Minogue inspired &quot;Did It Again&quot;. The track sees Minogue struggling to find the right identity. She uses an aggressive vocal style and whines about how she is messed up despite having it all. &quot;Jump&quot; advises the public to accept her and her personal choices throughout the course of her career.

&quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anyone&quot; does not have a linear storyline; the set of lyrics was taken from four songs, each interpreting a different mood and story. Cinquemani noted the energetic track sees Minogue wildly declare her independence while admitting her inborn vulnerability. &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot; talks about Minogue&#x27;s experiences while away from people and being happy. Written in Japan, the fifth track, &quot;Breathe&quot;, expresses her ability to contemplate and feel peaceful while in an intense environment. &quot;Dreams&quot; discussing the persistence of pushing boundaries and experimentation throughout her career. Phillips wrote that &quot;Dreams&quot;, the closing cinematic track, tells a thought-provoking fairytale.

The record&#x27;s remaining tracks discuss her relationship with Sednaoui. &quot;Cowboy Style&quot; details Minogue meeting Sednaoui for the first time. Minogue wrote &quot;Limbo&quot; in Spain, in which she discusses her inability to leave a certain country to meet someone, because of problems with its bureaucracy. Inspired by her relationship with Sednaoui, &quot;Say Hey&quot; highlights the need for communication, though not delving into conversation. Flick highlighted the self-examining lyrics of &quot;Limbo&quot; and &quot;Say Hey&quot;, commenting that Minogue had liberated darker thoughts from her subconscious on the album. The theme of frustration lingers in &quot;Drunk&quot;, which has Minogue feeling unsatisfied with the relationship, despite having so much feeling for someone. Minogue mentions meeting an ex-boyfriend on &quot;Through the Years&quot;, feeling insecure and doubtful about the entire situation.

==Artwork and title==

Stéphane Sednaoui shot the images and designed the cover sleeve. Inspired by French and Japanese pop culture, Sednaoui took inspiration from Nobuyoshi Araki&#x27;s erotic work and tried to convey a similar aesthetic to the photos. Initially, the cover art was based on a string of experimental images of Minogue in geisha costume; the concept was later revisited for the music video of &quot;GBI (German Bold Italic)&quot; (1997), Minogue&#x27;s collaboration with Towa Tei. The final cover depicts Minogue sitting and surrounded by swirling multi-coloured lights, dressed in a blue sleeveless Véronique Leroy minidress, with no title or name imprinted. Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album with a hologram sleeve, Sednaoui had to photograph separate artwork for those editions. The three dimensional lenticular sleeve required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue in the dark. To create the long-exposure effect of the lights circulating around the singer, Sednaoui fully dressed in a black bodysuit so he could not be seen in the final shot. The shoot took a week to complete, and Minogue had to pose for hours. She remarked &quot;the shoot was so very difficult but we knew that once we got it right it would be amazing&quot;. In 2004, Minogue donated the dress worn for the cover shot to the Cultural Gifts Program of the Arts Centre Melbourne.

The record&#x27;s title is a reference to the 1994 novel, &quot;Poems to Break the Harts of Impossible Princesses&quot;, written by Billy Childish. A copy of the book had been dedicated to Minogue but was accidentally passed on to Nick Cave, who eventually gave it to Minogue not long after, when she started working on the album. She recalled only looking at the title of the book and saying, &quot;It had me written all over it.&quot; Additionally, she believed the book&#x27;s poems summarised where she was at that point in her life under the spotlight. Minogue considered the title to be ironic, imaginary and that it conjured up a lot of truths from her life, saying, &quot;Sometimes my life feels so good that it&#x27;s almost too much–it&#x27;s like a joke–and sometimes it should be so good... but it doesn&#x27;t feel that way.&quot; The title is referenced in the chorus of the album track &quot;Dreams&quot;.

==Release==
Deconstruction planned to have the album out in January 1997, but postponed its release to May. Even with copies of the album already printed in mid-1997, it was delayed again to September. On 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car accident. Because of the impact of her death, Minogue and Deconstruction felt the album&#x27;s title was inappropriate and delayed its release for three months. The album also missed the planned January 1998 release. Frustrated with the constant delays, Minogue came to an agreement with her label to re-title it &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; in Europe and the United Kingdom. It is her third self-titled studio album, following her debut in 1988 and her 1994 album. Released on 28 March 1998, the album had the original cover design; the 1997 copyright year; and Minogue&#x27;s tribute to Sednaoui in the credits, despite having ended their relationship in late 1997.
On 22 October 1997, Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) released the album in the Japanese market, which included the bonus track &quot;Tears&quot;. The following month, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; was produced in both CD and cassette formats in Russia and Poland. The standard edition of &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; was finally made available in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in early January 1998, and was issued in Europe and the United Kingdom in March that year. The following month, BMG distributed it as a cassette tape in Malaysia, whilst the standard edition with new artwork was released in Taiwan. Deconstruction cancelled plans to release &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; in North America following the sudden closure of her US distributor Imago Records in late 1994.

In May 2003, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; was remastered by Festival Mushroom in Australia and New Zealand, and BMG for European and UK regions, as a double CD album; the release contained a bonus disc featured remixes and three unreleased recordings: &quot;Love Takes Over Me&quot;, &quot;Tears&quot;, and &quot;This Girl&quot;. The album re-instated the &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; title in Europe and the United Kingdom upon its re-release. In October 2022, 25 years after its original release, BMG released the album for the first time on vinyl. Using its original title &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;, the 25th Anniversary edition was reissued with three different coloured wax pressings and a limited edition Picture Disc variant.

Because of constant delays in 1997, Mushroom Records premiered six of the album tracks—&quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot;, &quot;Too Far&quot;, &quot;Say Hey&quot;, &quot;Limbo&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anyone&quot;, and &quot;Did It Again&quot;—on a special sample compact disc in Australia. Deconstruction conducted a similar promotional campaign in Europe and distributed six different songs on a sample cassette tape. &quot;Live and Other Sides&quot; was released accompanied by Australian releases of the album at HMV in 1998, with two unreleased &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; tracks, one unreleased &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; track, and three live tracks. Another EP, &quot;Other Sides&quot;, featured the two B-sides, &quot;Love Takes Over Me&quot; and &quot;Tears&quot; and an unreleased &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; track, &quot;Take Me with You&quot;. Minogue&#x27;s fourth remix album, &quot;Mixes&quot;, includes singles from the album; it was released in the UK in August 1998. In Australia, the remix album was replaced by &quot;Impossible Remixes&quot;, featuring the previously unreleased &quot;Breathe (TNT Club Mix)&quot;. Several album tracks and three unreleased tracks from &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; appear on &quot;Hits+&quot; (2000) released in Europe.

==Promotion==
===Live performances and tour===

Minogue&#x27;s press campaign for the album began in mid-1997, including interviews with magazines and a performance at the Radio 1 Roadshow in Newquay on 21 August 1997. The promotional campaign was aimed at album buyers, rather than the singles market. The label stressed Minogue&#x27;s wide-reaching appeal by setting up press cover interviews for her in various markets: broadsheets, dance specialists, tabloids, gay magazines, and style monthlies. During the release week in March 1998, Deconstruction and Minogue held a release party at Tower Records in London. She conducted a small-concert tour travelling to Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong through October 1997; it was her first time in both New Zealand and Hong Kong. Minogue expanded the tour by adding venues in Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. She appeared on several television shows to promote the album&#x27;s singles. She promoted the album at the 1998 Mardi Gras ceremony in Sydney, Australia.

In May 1998, Minogue announced the Intimate and Live concert tour, which began on 2 June at the Palais Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, that same year. Initially, she wanted to finish the tour in Melbourne on 4 July, but because of high demand in England, Minogue hosted three additional concert performances there. The tour attracted positive reviews from both attendees and publications, praising the idea of a smaller venue show. She received compliments for her vocal performance and her stage presence. Each concert had drawn in approximately 2,000 audience members in Australia, and the media there deemed it a commercial success. To complete the tour&#x27;s promotion, an accompanying live album and DVD, shot at the Capitol Theatre, Sydney, were released on 30 November (album) and 23 July 2003 (DVD).

===Singles===
Minogue wanted to introduce the album in a way that would intrigue and surprise the public. &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot; was chosen as the lead single in September 1997. David Mould directed the music video shot in the Desert of Tabernas in Spain; it features Dexter Fletcher as Minogue&#x27;s lover. Released a week after Diana&#x27;s death, &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot; was a commercial disappointment: it peaked at number 22 in the UK, Minogue&#x27;s first single to not reach the top 20 there. It reached number 27 in Australia, and number 46 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, her last charting release there in the 1990s.

The second single was &quot;Did It Again&quot;, released on 24 November 1997 with the B-side &quot;Tears&quot;. Minogue promoted the single heavily on television in the UK, which led to it peaking at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart in December where it remained for another six weeks. In Australia, it peaked at number 15 and lasted 17 weeks in the top 50, one of her longest spanning singles on the chart. Petro Romanhi directed the accompanying music video shot in London, in which Minogue portrays four different versions of herself: SexKylie, CuteKylie, IndieKylie, and DanceKylie. &quot;Breathe&quot;, Minogue&#x27;s final single under Deconstruction, was released on 9 March 1998 featuring mixes from Sash! and Todd Terry. Welsh film director Kieran Evans directed the accompanying music video in which Minogue floats in an airspace of spiral effects. The single reached number 23 in Australia and inside the top 20 in the UK.

Because of popular demand, &quot;Too Far&quot; was released on 12&quot; vinyl in May 1998 as a promotional single. Two remixes were made for the single: a Brothers in Rhythm remix that contains new vocals and adlibs from Minogue, and a Europop remix by Junior Vasquez. &quot;Too Far&quot; was planned to be the final single and was to be released commercially as a vinyl triple pack, but these plans were scrapped. Instead, &quot;Cowboy Style&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s final single, with &quot;Love Takes Over Me&quot; on the B-side, on 5 October 1998 and distributed only in Australia. It was not released in the UK because of Minogue&#x27;s departure from Deconstruction in November. Owing to a limited number of issued formats, the track only charted for a single week at number 39 on the Australian regional top 50.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, critical reception of &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; was sharply divided. UK magazine &quot;Q&quot; lambasted the record&#x27;s repetitious nature, while &quot;Music Week&quot; acknowledged the improvement in Minogue&#x27;s vocal range and abilities. Ben Willmott of &quot;NME&quot; criticised the production of collaborator James Dean Bradfield, and labelled Minogue a &quot;total fraud&quot; for introducing new musical genres that were disparate from her previous work.

Some reviewers, mostly from outside of the UK, gave overwhelming praise to its production and Minogue&#x27;s contribution. An editor at &quot;Who&quot; magazine and Cameron Adams of &quot;Herald Sun&quot; called it Minogue&#x27;s best and most complete work, praising her vocal delivery. Mangan commended her songwriting skills and the diverse set of styles, writing that the album &quot;sounds right and constitutes another step in the right direction.&quot; Adams opined that Minogue had produced &quot;the classy, personal pop album she has always threatened.&quot; Dwyer highlighted the club-dance tracks as the better cuts, adding that the album shows Minogue&#x27;s progress musically despite its wide range of styles and collaborators. Flick commented that Minogue &quot;has finally found her voice—both literally and spiritually&quot;.

Retrospective reviews of &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; have been much more positive. In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2011), British writer Colin Larkin gave it three out of five stars, classifying it as &quot;recommended&quot; and &quot;highly listenable&quot;. True found the album stronger and more natural than her previous efforts, and it flows together as an album. Cinquemani was impressed with the album&#x27;s personal and unified cord, saying it is &quot;the work of an artist willing to take risks&quot;. Levine noticed its lack of commercial appeal, while praising the diverse set genres and Minogue&#x27;s input. He called the album a &quot;brave, revealing and rarely less than surprising&quot; piece of work. While reviewing her tenth album &quot;X&quot; (2007), Evan Sawdey of &quot;PopMatters&quot; commented that &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; is &quot;one of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created.&quot;

==Public reaction==
During its commercial release, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; was criticised by the British public, who did not appreciate Minogue&#x27;s move into indie music and electronica. The audience failed to identify with her new intimate image, dubbed as &quot;IndieKylie&quot;, and was unimpressed with her new musical direction, viewing it as a trend-chasing attempt. The backlash resulted in &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; making little impact on British record charts, which led British publications to label &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; Minogue&#x27;s worst-selling studio album at the time in those regions. A year after its release, Virgin Radio mocked the album&#x27;s sales, stating: &quot;We&#x27;ve done something to improve Kylie&#x27;s records: we&#x27;ve banned them.&quot;

Several factors were named as reasons for the poor public perception: the lack of promotional activity, the three-year gap since her last album, the constant delays and title changes, and the change of musical direction. Minogue cited the incohesive material, her &quot;IndieKylie&quot; image portrayed by the media, as well as the long gap between albums, as the main reasons for the album&#x27;s commercial failure; while Baker felt it was the lack of proper promotion and management on Deconstruction&#x27;s end. Anderson felt the release of &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot; as the lead single overshadowed Minogue&#x27;s involvement on the track, and the album as a whole. Minogue said that after the single release, she had to &quot;keep telling people that this isn&#x27;t an indie-guitar album. I&#x27;m not about to pick up a guitar and rock.&quot; James Dean Bradfield admitted he felt guilty that the single release had &quot;landed [Minogue] with a whole new set of problems&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
Under the title &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;, the album debuted and peaked at number 10 on the UK Albums Chart, making it the third-highest debuting album of that week and Minogue&#x27;s sixth top-10 entry. It fell to number 22 the following week and again to number 41, its final charting position was at number 70. The album sold 20,000 copies in the first two weeks of release, just ten percent of the expected sales figures. The album entered its fifth and final week, during the start of May 1998, at number 91. In a similar run, the album charted at number 10 on the Scottish Albums Chart. The album had sold 64,483 copies in the UK as of October 2020.

The album debuted and peaked at number four on the Australian Albums Chart on 25 January 1998. It stalled at number eight during its second and third weeks, but fell outside the top ten in its fourth. By 26 April, the album had spent 14 weeks on the chart and was placed at number 48 before leaving the chart. Whilst embarking on her Intimate and Live tour in June, it entered the top ten for three non-consecutive weeks between June and July. The album appeared in the top 50 for 35 weeks, making it Minogue&#x27;s longest-charting album at the time. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the Platinum by for physical shipments of 70,000 units.

The 2022 vinyl reissue reached number five on the UK Albums Chart on 28 October 2022, eclipsing its original number-ten peak in 1998. The album opened with 6,384 album-equivalent unit, all but 44 of which were vinyl LPs; it was the third best-selling vinyl album of the week. It was the first time the album charted under the title &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;, giving Minogue her fifteenth top-five entry. The album also reached new chart peaks in Scotland and Australia, peaking at numbers four and three, respectively.

==Accolades and impact==
&quot;Impossible Princess&quot; gained four nominations at the 1998 ARIA Music Awards show, which was held in October. The album was nominated for Best Pop Release, Best Female Musician, and Album of the Year—her first nomination in this category. She lost Album of the Year to &quot;Unit&quot; (1997) by Regurgitator, while losing Pop Release and Female Musician to Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia. The following year, Minogue was nominated for Best Female Artist for &quot;Cowboy Style&quot;, which lost to Imbruglia&#x27;s &quot;Wishing I Was There&quot; (1998). The music video for &quot;Did It Again&quot; won the 1998 International Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award – MTV Australia.

Because of pressure from the British press and public, Minogue contemplated retiring from the music industry for good. She decided instead to part with Deconstruction and BMG in November 1998. In 1999, Minogue signed to Parlophone and released her studio album &quot;Light Years&quot; in 2000 to a positive reception. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Tim Jonze believes that &quot;Light Years&quot; saved her career, while Louise Bruton of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, said that &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; is the low point &quot;she needed to reach the great heights of 2000&#x27;s &quot;Light Years&quot;&quot;. Minogue has considered &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; the most disappointing moment in her career, and commented that if she wrote another album of personal songs, &quot;it would be seen as &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; 2 and be equally critiqued&quot;.

Retrospectively, the album has been regarded by music critics as Minogue&#x27;s most personal and misunderstood work. True and Cinquemani applauded her writing contribution, calling it her &quot;great leap forward&quot; in terms of musical composition. On the 20th anniversary of the album, Ben Neutze of &quot;Daily Review&quot; opined that it stands as &quot;the most intriguing chapter of her career, and the only significant glimpse at who this pop icon might be when stripped of other glorious facades.&quot; Caz Tran of ABC Online called it &quot;the creative detour [Minogue] needed to take&quot; regarding her evolution and self-discovery. Levine and Larrisa Dubecki of &quot;The Age&quot; viewed the album as one of the key re-inventions of her recording career. Several critics noticed the sonic and lyrical similarities between the album and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998) by Madonna. Cinquemani observed that despite the success of &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; brought a harsh reaction from the public. Owen Myers of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described both albums, alongside Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; (1997), as &quot;a trilogy of A-list experimental pop records in 1997-8 that addressed their artists’ fears, anxieties, and dreams.&quot; Media publications &quot;Flavorwire&quot;, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Faster Louder&quot; listed the album as one of the most underrated pop albums.

<text>South Norwalk is a neighborhood in Norwalk, Connecticut which corresponds to the city&#x27;s Second Taxing District. Often referred to as SoNo, the neighborhood was originally settled as Old Well, then chartered as the city of South Norwalk on August 18, 1870. The cities of Norwalk and South Norwalk were incorporated on June 6, 1913. South Norwalk underwent major redevelopment during the early 21st century, with many new apartments being constructed, often in close proximity to South Norwalk station, and generally more expensive than existing housing.

South Norwalk is a diverse neighborhood both from a socioeconomic and racial perspective.

The neighborhood hosts the annual SoNo Arts Festival, an event that showcases local artists, businesses, and musical acts. The annual Norwalk Oyster Festival, sponsored by the Norwalk Seaport Association, is held at Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Park, across the Norwalk Harbor in East Norwalk.

==History==
===Old Well===
The area of present-day South Norwalk developed out of a local well referred to as the &quot;Old Well&quot;, where sailing ships would refill their water casks. Said well was in service since at least 1738, when a deed referred to nearby Washington Street as &quot;the highway that leads to ye landing place called Ye Old Well&quot;. The well&#x27;s location was depicted as east of Water Street, and about 75 feet South of Washington Street in a 1867 map by American cartographer Frederick W. Beers, although the exact location is unknown, though presumed to be near the site of Donovan’s Tavern, since sailors are said to have frequented the tavern.

The area evolved into a settlement named Old Well. after the well, and was involved in coastal trade, manufacturing, and shipbuilding, as well as having many farms with diversified crops.

“Old Well was scarcely a village in those days, but rather a group of farms, and the well which gave the place its name was on Water street, near the corner of Haviland street, on the property of Eliakim Raymond, a patriarch of several Norwalk lines. His house stood at the corner of Washington and Water streets before the Revolution and was burned with rest of the town.&quot;

===City of South Norwalk===
&quot;Norwalk was made a borough in 1836, and the village of Old Well, named from an ancient well where vessels were supplied with water, was incorporated into a city in 1868, and named South Norwalk two years afterward.&quot; &quot;South Norwalk, formerly called &quot;Old Well&quot; was organized a city August 18, 1870, under a charter granted by the Legislature of Connecticut, July 5 of the same year&quot;. In 1873, the City of South Norwalk was incorporated within the Town of Norwalk, although it maintained its city status and retained control over its own assets. &quot;The 1870 charter was revised by the Legislature April 19, 1882, and the city continued its existence under this revised charter until May 27, 1897, when the Legislature approved a revised and amended charter, under which the city has since continued and worked.&quot;

Around this time, Norwalk had refused to share its water system with South Norwalk, contributing to a sense of ill will between the two cities, which would compete for economic development throughout subsequent decades.

&quot;In the 1800s, industrialization started to take place--large factories manufacturing goods such as firearms, buttons, shoes, cloth and hats were increasing in Connecticut and in Norwalk. Workers came up from Chesapeake, Maryland, to work as oystermen. Wealthy owners and managers of businesses lived on &quot;Golden Hill&quot; overlooking South Norwalk. Immigrants came into Norwalk from many places. One of the largest [group] to come here in the early 1900s was the Hungarians; there were also many Eastern European Jews and Italians, among others.&quot;

Horse-drawn trolleys began serving South Norwalk in the 1860s, until being upgraded to electric trolleys in 1894.

Industrialization in South Norwalk resulted in the city becoming a center for local industry, hosting its own railroad station, the Norwalk Harbor, an electric trolley system, its own water company, electric company, and well-developed school system.

==== Consolidation into Norwalk ====
Despite the industrialization of South Norwalk, various economic forces pressured the city South Norwalk to merge into Norwalk, as both cities were often too small independent of one another to host large industries. South Norwalk was hesitant to consolidate into Norwalk, due to South Norwalk&#x27;s industry surpassing that of Norwalk. South Norwalk, alongside East Norwalk, even tried to leave the Town of Norwalk altogether in 1902, with South Norwalk&#x27;s mayor Mortimer M. Lee touting that South Norwalk had &quot;a large water system, a splendid electric light plant, a separate sewer system, a public library and a library building and schools second to none&quot;. In 1903 the Connecticut State Legislature passed a bill to create an independent Town of South Norwalk, but it was vetoed by then-governor Abiram Chamberlain.

As a compromise, Norwalk allowed for South Norwalk, East Norwalk, and Rowayton to join Norwalk as taxing districts, allowing them to largely maintain their own municipal services while within Norwalk.

=== Within Norwalk ===

In 1935, South Norwalk&#x27;s trolley system was discontinued, and replaced by a bus service.

South Norwalk began suffering from a period of deindustrialization in the 1950s, as many industries, including Norwalk&#x27;s sizable hat industry, either went into decline or relocated out of New England. This industrial decay led to the enactment of various urban renewal projects beginning in the 1960s, namely, the demolition of older buildings and factories along western Washington Street to build new offices, a shopping center, and low-cost housing. The Norwalk Redevelopment Agency planned to continue this effort in the 1970s, with plans to replace the older buildings along eastern Washington Street, but were thwarted by local residents, who successfully got the buildings added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

In 1988, the Maritime Aquarium was opened in a disused factory building.

During the 21st century, South Norwalk has seen a period of redevelopment centered around the construction of new apartments, many of which are located near South Norwalk station.

== Geography ==
Administratively, the Norwalk Second Taxing District, synonymous with South Norwalk, is bordered by Route 1 (locally signed as Connecticut Avenue) to the north, and the Norwalk Harbor and the Norwalk River to the east. The neighborhood&#x27;s southern border runs from Windsor Place to Neptune Avenue, up against the Norwalk River, and the neighborhood&#x27;s western border runs from Windsor Place up to Connecticut Avenue.

== Demographics ==
All of South Norwalk is represented by the 06854 ZIP Code, which also includes some areas to its south and west. As of 2020, the ZIP Code has an average family income of $74,597, slightly below the Connecticut average of $79,855; the poverty rate is 14.5%, higher than the Connecticut total of 9.8%; 34.2% of the population has a Bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, below the state total of 40.0%; the ZIP code has an employment rate 65.4%, higher than the Connecticut total of 61.7%; 22.0% of the population lacks health care coverage, significantly higher than the state total of 5.1%; 22.5% of the population is under 18 years old, slightly higher than the state total of 20.6%; the average household size is 3.25, slightly higher than the state total of 3.08.

<doc id="617085" wikidata="Q7698990" url="?curid=617085" title="Temporary residency in Canada">
<text>In Canada, temporary residency () applies to those who are not Canadian citizens but are legally in Canada for a temporary purpose, including international students, foreign workers, and tourists.

Whereas &quot;Permanent Residence&quot; (PR) is a requirement for Canadian citizenship, temporary residency has little to do with citizenship, in that one cannot go from temporary resident to citizen without first going through another program. More specifically, the classes of Temporary Resident Documents under IMM1442 are as follows:

* Temporary Student — study permit (also IMM1208),
* Temporary Worker — work permit (also IMM 1102),
* Temporary Visitor — visitor record (also IMM 1097),
* Temporary Resident Permit holder who require the permit to overcome inadmissibility issues

Some foreign nationals require a Temporary Resident Visa () to visit Canada.

It is against Canadian federal law to bring in temporary foreign workers if Canadian workers are available. For an employer to hire a foreign worker or to allow a foreign worker to in Canada, they may need obtain a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). A positive LMIA or a confirmation letter grants permission to the employer who proves that there is a need for a foreign worker to fill the job as no Canadian worker is available and that such hiring will not negatively impact the Canadian labour market.

== Temporary Foreign Worker Program ==
The Temporary Foreign Worker Program (, TFWP) is a program of the Government of Canada that allows employers in Canada to hire foreign nationals. Workers brought in under the program are referred to as Temporary Foreign Workers (TFWs) and are allowed to work in positions that are not filled by Canadians. The aim was to address skill shortages and promote economic growth. Initially, the program was aimed at nurses and farm workers, but today it gives highly skilled and less skilled workers the opportunity to work in Canada. Unlike applicants for permanent residence, the Canada&#x27;s Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) does not have a cap on the number of applicants admitted; instead, numbers are dictated primarily by employer demand.

Between 1993 and 2013, the total number of TFW more than doubled to 338,189 workers; between 2006 and 2014 alone, over 500,000 workers were brought into Canada under the program. When TFWP began in 1973, most of the individuals brought in were high-skill workers, such as medical specialists. In 2002, however, a &quot;low-skilled workers&quot; category was added, which now makes up most of the temporary foreign workforce. In 2006, the program was expanded, introducing fast-tracking for some locations. It was revised again in 2013, raising wages, charging employer fees, and removing the accelerated applications.

From 2002 and 2011, the number of temporary foreign workers (TFW) residing in Canada had a three-fold increase, from about 101,000 to 300,000. For the first time in 2007, overall temporary migration overtook permanent migration, with the highest increase being in the number of TFWs that entered the country, and within that the largest increase accounted for those in lower-skilled occupations in farming, caregiving, service &amp; retail, clerical work, manufacturing and construction. There was also a 73% increase in the number of entries and re-entries into the country in the 2002-2008 period.

The expansion of the TFWP to accommodate workers in lower-skilled occupations has been influenced by general increased employer demand of lower-skilled workers, particularly in the oil, gas, and construction sectors. In 2002, the pilot project for Hiring Foreign Workers in Occupations that Require Lower Levels of Formal Training was introduced. The project has since evolved to better suit employers needs, for example by increasing the length of the work permit from 12 to 24 months. However this is not the case for those entering through 2 occupation-specific programs: the Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP) or the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP).

In 2018, the number of workers allowed increased by 36% and more than 17,600 permits were issued.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian government, together with the TFWP, sought out to increase protection for foreign workers through protective legislation.

===Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program===

Implemented in 1966, more than 29,000 agricultural workers enter Canada every year through this program from the Caribbean and Mexico. The program exists as an agreement between sending countries and the Canadian government to provide seasonal agricultural workers during peak Canadian production. Particular sectors that report labour shortages are often the fruits, vegetables and horticultural sectors. Those who enter through this program can work for a maximum of 8 months per year.

In 2009, half of agricultural migrants were from Mexico (about 15,800 people). Among these migrants, 75% have been re-entering the program for 4 years or more, while 57%, for 6 years or more.

===Live-in Caregiver Program===

Replacing the foreign domestic movement (FDM) in 1992, the Live-in Caregiver program accepts between 2,500 and 3,500 caregivers each year. According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, &quot;Live-in caregivers are individuals who are qualified to provide care for children, elderly persons or persons with disabilities in private homes without supervision.&quot;

Applicants to the program must meet certain criteria, some of which include: high school education, equivalent to Canadian standards, language ability, as well as a written contract by an employer and Employment and Social Development Canada approval that labour shortages necessitate hiring abroad.

Recruitment into this program is seen to be racialized and gendered, as 95.6% of Canada&#x27;s live-in caregivers are women from the Philippines. Despite this, and unlike the SAWP, no formal labour agreement exists to govern these migratory flows. Rather, an informal Filipino community network, as well as the Philippine government&#x27;s labour export strategy facilitates and regulates the continuous migratory flows between the two countries. Also unlike those who enter through the SAWP, LCP applicants can apply for permanent residency at the end of their 2-year contract.

== International Experience Canada ==
The International Experience Canada (IEC) program provides young nationals from select countries, with the opportunity to travel and work in Canada for a maximum of 24 months. Interested candidates are randomly selected depending on the spots available for their country of origin and for the category in which they are eligible.

There are three categories under IEC:
# Working Holiday,
# Young Professionals, and
# International Co-op Internship.
In order to be able to participate in the IEC, the country or territory that the candidate is a citizen of must have an agreement with Canada, allowing them to apply for an IEC work permit.

Alternatively, if they do not belong to any such country or territory, they must be able to make use of a recognized organization (RO). ROs, for the purposes of IEC, include: AIESEC, GO International, International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience (IAESTE), International Rural Exchange (IRE), Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN), Stepwest, WAP Working Holidays, University of British Columbia, and University of New Brunswick.

Furthermore, the candidate will also have to successfully meet the eligibility requirements for their country or territory of citizenship as well as of the specific pool that they are applying for. Usually, countries that have an agreement with Canada as to the IEC program allow candidates to participate in the program only 1 time. Other countries, though allowing a candidate to apply 2 times, will require the candidates to apply in different pools each of the times that they apply for the IEC.

Those holding a refugee travel document that has been issued by a country with a youth mobility agreement with Canada are not eligible to participate in the IEC program. While dependents cannot be taken along on the IEC, dependents might apply for visiting, studying, or working Canada. The applications are to be assessed separately and not along with that of the IEC candidate.

== Employment ==
Apart from their temporary status, TFWs have the same employment rights as Canadian workers, and can phone a free 1-800 number for help. However, because of the way in which the Canadian residence of a temporary foreign worker is tied to an employer, some TFWs have said they have been treated worse than Canadian co-workers.

Foreign agricultural workers make up roughly 60% of all workers coming into the country under the TFWP.

==Criticism and debate==
Criticism surrounding temporary residents of Canada has been contentious and subjective topic in the Canadian government and the public. Under the 29th Canadian Ministry, two-thirds of Canadians (65%) believe that the government admits too many temporary residents and prospective immigrants with its current immigration plan, according to a poll conducted by Léger

In May 2014, the TFWP was the focus of debate between the 28th Canadian Ministry and the New Democratic Party official opposition questioned at the House of Commons about the program. &quot;CBC&quot; reported that some employers were said to be abusing the TFWP by bringing in temporary foreign workers to areas where qualified local workers were collecting Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. During Question Period, Harper said that the government had addressed this issue before 2013, and that changes had been made to both the EI and TFW programs in order to address these issues. He stated that the NDP did not cooperate at the time in the introduction of the changes, and that NDP Members of Parliament requested more foreign workers in their own ridings.

In January 2014, Employment Minister Jason Kenney pledged a second round of reforms citing employee frustration. In April, issues with the program came under scrutiny by &quot;CBC&quot; relating to the procurement of temporary foreign unskilled labour by McDonald&#x27;s Canada. On 24 April, Kenney announced that the TFWP had been suspended for the food-services industry. It has since been renewed.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic the Canadian government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his 29th Ministry gradually admitted a large number of TFW&#x27;s, and increase the number of permanent residents Canada welcomes each year to 500,000 in 2025, a decision that drew considerable attention and scrutiny. This was done against the Public Service of Canada wishes, who warned of lack of adequate housing and infrastructure. 

As of 2021, there are over 775,000 temporary foreign workers in Canada, with them representing 4% of the workforce. The majority of temporary foreign workers are employed in low-prestige jobs, such as fast food workers. Several economists have said temporary foreign workers and international students increasingly form the backbone of low-wage labour. Mike Moffatt, an economist and professor at the University of Western Ontario, said that “What we’re basically bringing in a lot of is, essentially, temporary foreign workers under student permits to work fast-food jobs and things like that.”

=== Media investigations ===
Since 2013, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) began reporting on issues surrounding the hiring of temporary foreign workers by companies who 

On 6 April 2013, &quot;CBC News&quot; reported that Canadian IT workers at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) were losing their jobs to replacement foreign workers, who were brought from India by outsourcing firm iGATE. Existing RBC employees trained their replacements before they themselves were laid off, causing their appeal to the media. RBC responded to the controversy by issuing a statement denying the charges and offering clarification of the situation. While a reported 45 employees lost their jobs, the bank nevertheless had indicated that they intended to expand this practice in the coming year.

Additionally in 2013, CBC found that, in Saskatchewan, 65% of recent newly created jobs were held by temporary foreign workers, and in Nova Scotia over one thousand employers had requested foreign workers. &quot;CBC&quot; also reported that a Chinese company that owns a mine in British Columbia was attempting to import workers from China. According to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, one of the requirements of the job was the ability to speak Mandarin Chinese.

In October 2013, The Huffington Post reported that the Alberta Federation of Labour said foreign workers were displacing Canadian workers in Fort McMurray. The report claimed that 270 Canadian workers employed by a Toronto-based firm were to be replaced by foreign workers employed by an Italian firm. On 23 October, &quot;Global News&quot; reported that Farmers of North America, in Saskatoon, was helping farmers recruit TFWs in order to help them. The Canadian Federation of Agriculture reportedly estimated that Canada was in need of 30,000 seasonal and longer-term farm workers. Employment Canada acknowledged that there was a shortage of agricultural workers.

In December 2014, CBC reported that Microsoft Canada obtained an exemption from the federal government that will allow the company to bring in an unspecified number of TFW to British Columbia. The trainee foreign workers (most of whom would be citizens of India and China) were to be hired without requiring Microsoft to look for Canadian workers who could fill the positions.

=== Issues with the Live-in Caregiver Program ===
The exploitation of migrant labour has been a key issue amongst labour and civil society groups. Many have suggested that the structure of Canadian temporary migration programs, particularly the Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP), perpetuate social and economic inequalities in the long-term. There are little provincial employment standards regarding the recruitment and monitoring of the LCP, which leaves migrant workers vulnerable to exploitation. At present, only the province of British Columbia requires that workers be registered by their employers under the Domestic Workers&#x27; Registry. Employment agencies, on the other hand, are only regulated in two provinces, British Columbia, and Alberta, and their regulation only amounts to operating licensing requirements.

The lack of systemic regulation makes it difficult for contract violations to be contested. Under the law, contracts should specify total work hours, vacation time, wages, and benefits. However, in a study conducted by a Montreal organization, PINAY, together with the McGill University School of Social Work, it was found that in 25% of the 148 live-in caregivers studied, employers did not sign a contract at all, and 43% claimed that they weren&#x27;t paid for overtime work.

Another issue with temporary migrants is the limited mobility afforded to them within the confines of their stipulated contracts. What sets the LCP apart from the TFWP is that applicants are required to have a minimum secondary school education as well as domestic service training. Research has even found that a large number of those applying through the LCP program are overqualified and have post-secondary education, and training as registered practitioners and nurses from their origin countries. However, due to the live-in requirement and the length of the LCP contract, deskilling occurs, wherein educational qualifications and training once held by immigrants prior to entering the program are not utilized or developed. This leads to downward occupational mobility as re-entry into the labour market with a skilled position becomes difficult upon the end of the contract, and once permanent residency is achieved.

=== Abuse of workers and accusations of modern slavery in Canada ===
In 2017, the Toronto Star conducted an investigation that revealed a large number of cases of incorrect accommodation, lack of access to medical care, violence and abuse.

In July 2024, a report for the United Nations Human Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery Tomoya Obokata described the program as a &quot;breeding ground for contemporary slavery&quot;. Obokata&#x27;s report found many instances of debt bondage, wage theft, lack of personal protective equipment, abuse, and sexual misconduct. Immigration minister Marc Miller gave a statement to Reuters saying that the program was &quot;in need of reform&quot; and that the low-wage stream needed to be examined.

<doc id="617092" wikidata="Q524181" url="?curid=617092" title="Hamelin de Warenne, Earl of Surrey">
<text>Hamelin de Warenne, Earl of Surrey ( 1130 – 7 May 1202) (&quot;alias&quot; Hamelin of Anjou and, anachronistically, Hamelin Plantagenet), was an Anglo-Angevin nobleman, being an elder half-brother of the first Plantagenet English monarch King Henry II.

==Origins==
Hamelin was an illegitimate son of Geoffrey of Anjou, Count of Anjou. He was thus a half-brother of King Henry II of England, and an uncle to both King Richard I and King John.

==Marriage and children==
King Henry II arranged for him to marry Isabel de Warenne, 4th Countess of Surrey, the widow of William of Blois, one of the wealthiest heiresses in England. The marriage occurred in April 1164, following which he was recognised as &quot;Comte de Warenne&quot; (that being the customary designation for what more technically should be &quot;Earl of Surrey&quot;) and adopted the surname &quot;de Warenne&quot;, as did his descendants. By his wife he had one son and three daughters, as follows:
*William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, only son and heir, who married Maud Marshal, daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke&lt;ref name=&quot;CPXII/1-500g&quot;&gt;George Edward Cokayne, &quot;The complete peerage; or, A history of the House of lords and all its members from the earliest times&quot;, Vol. XII/1, Ed. Geoffrey H. White (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1953), p. 500 n. g&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adela de Warenne, who married firstly Robert de Newburgh and, secondly William FitzWilliam of Sprotborough. She was a mistress of her half-first cousin King John, and by him was the mother of Richard FitzRoy, feudal baron of Chilham, in Kent.
*Maud de Warenne (&quot;alias&quot; Matilda), who married, firstly, Henry II, Count of Eu and Lord of Hastings, secondly, Henry d&#x27;Estouteville, Seigneur de Valmont.
*Isabel de Warenne, who married, firstly, Robert de Lacy of Pontefract Castle in Yorkshire, and secondly, Gilbert de l&#x27;Aigle, Lord of Pevensey Castle in Sussex.

==Career==

Warenne was prominent at the royal court of King Henry II, and at those of his sons and successors King Richard I and King John. Warenne&#x27;s lands in England centered on Conisbrough Castle in Yorkshire, which was a powerful castle he rebuilt. He also possessed the &quot;third penny&quot; (an entitlement to one third of the fines levied in the county courts) of his County of Surrey and held the castles of Mortemer and Bellencombre in Normandy.

In 1164 Hamelin joined in the denunciations of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, although after Becket&#x27;s murder he became a great believer in Becket&#x27;s sainthood, having reportedly been cured of blindness by the saint&#x27;s intervention. In 1176 he escorted his niece Joan to Sicily for her marriage, where she became Queen of Sicily.

He remained loyal to Henry II through all the problems during the later part of his reign when many nobles deserted him, and continued as a close supporter of that king&#x27;s eldest son and his own nephew, Richard I. During Richard&#x27;s absence on the Third Crusade, he took the side of the regent William Longchamp. Hamelin was present at the second coronation of King Richard in 1194 and at King John&#x27;s coronation in 1199.

==Death and succession==
He died in 1202 and was buried in the chapter house of Lewes Priory in Sussex. He was succeeded by his son William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey.

<text>Grandizo Munis (18 April 19124 February 1989) was a Spanish Trotskyist politician turned left-communist following his break with the Fourth International.

== Biography ==

Grandizo first entered revolutionary politics as a member of the Izquierda Comunista de España (ICE). This group was led by Andreu Nin and was in sympathy with the views of Leon Trotsky and therefore affiliated to the International Communist League.

Trotsky was opposed to the name of the group, which he argued was imprecise and badly expressed the program of the Bolshevik-Leninists. In addition, he entered into a dispute with Nin and the ICE when they refused his suggestion to enter the youth organisation of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE). The majority of the ICE then split with Trotsky, leaving a small remnant grouping which included Grandizo Munis.

With the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Munis was a member of the tiny Seccion Bolshevik-Leninista. This organisation sought to influence the ranks of the larger Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) and also worked closely with the more left-wing anarchists of the Durruti Column.

The Trotskyists were among the very few to oppose the Popular Front government and openly took part in the May Days of 1937. This event led to their suppression by the government, which was now dominated by the Stalinists. This meant that Munis was forced into illegality and had to flee for fear of his life. , a number of Spanish anti-fascist fighters 

He was arrested on February 13, 1938 but the next year, shortly before the fall of Barcelona, he was able to escape the Monjuic Prison, cross Franco&#x27;s lines and eventually pass over the border to France. He made his fate public in an interview with the French Trotskyist newspaper &quot;La Lutte Ouvrière&quot; published in its February 24 and March 3, 1939, issues.

In the spring of 1940 Munis fled France to Mexico, where he had a meeting with Trotsky, then to New York, where he attended the May 1940 Emergency Conference of the Fourth International. Back in Mexico, that August he spoke at Leon Trotsky&#x27;s funeral.

Munis spent the remainder of the war years in Mexico, where he reestablished a section of the Fourth International among Spanish exiles. He managed to produce two issues of a printed magazine &quot;19 de Julio&quot;, then began a mimeographed periodical, &quot;Contra la Corriente&quot;. Some of the articles in these journals were translated into the SWPs theoretical organ &quot;Fourth International&quot;. He was assisted in this effort by the French surrealist poet Benjamin Péret, who had also fled to Mexico.

During the war and immediate post-war years Munis began to have differences with the Fourth International Secretariat based in New York, and with the Socialist Workers Party of the United States. These first began with a critique of the SWP leaders&#x27; actions during the Minneapolis trials. On an ideological level he claimed that the USSR was no longer a workers&#x27; state of any kind, but state capitalist. He also rejected united fronts with Stalinist parties and key parts of the Transitional Program including nationalization and a government of traditional workers parties. He also had organizational differences with the Fourth International. He was supported in some of these criticism by Natalya Sedova, the widow of Leon Trotsky.
At the Second World Congress of the Fourth International Munis blocked with Max Shachtman of the Workers Party but was eventually condemned by the Secretariat.

After the war Munis settled in Paris and began publishing a new periodical &quot;Revoluciòn&quot;, which proclaimed its official break with the Fourth International in November 1948. By 1949 his following was calling itself the Grupo Comunista Internacionalista de España. In 1951 Munis and J. Costa returned to Spain to organize an underground movement in the wake of the Barcelona tramway strike. They were unsuccessful and arrested by the Francoist authorities in 1952 and sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment. Munis was released in 1957 and returned to Paris, where he began publishing a new organ, &quot;Alarma&quot;. With the relaxation of the Francoist regime in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Munis group was able to establish a small following within Spain, though Munis himself continued to live in France. By the time of Franco&#x27;s death, in the mid-1970s this group numbered about 50 people. However, differences between the exiles in Paris and the younger personnel in Barcelona precipitated a purge by the exiles of the Spanish group until there were only two or three members left in 1983.

Munis also had followers in several other countries and in the late 1970s these were organized into the Revolutionary Workers Ferment with sections in France, Italy, Greece and the United States. The American group, the FOR Organizing Committee of the United States or FOCUS left in 1981 in solidarity with the expelled Spanish members.

Munis wrote many articles and books in his life, the best known being &quot;A Second Communist Manifesto&quot; and a history of the Spanish Civil War.

<text>Édouard Rod (31 March 185729 January 1910) was a French-Swiss novelist.

==Early life and education==
He was born at Nyon, in western Switzerland, studied at Lausanne, where he wrote his doctoral thesis about the Oedipus legend (&quot;Le développement de la légende d&#x27;Œdipe dans l&#x27;histoire de la littérature&quot;), and Berlin, and in 1878 relocated to Paris.

==Career==
In 1881, he dedicated his novel, &quot;Palmyre Veulard&quot;, to Zola, of whom he was at this time of his career a faithful disciple. A series of novels of similar tendency followed. In 1884, he became editor of the magazine &quot;Revue contemporaine&quot;, and in 1887 succeeded Marc Monnier as professor of comparative literature at Geneva, where he remained until 1893.

His novel &quot;La Course à la mort&quot; (1888) marks a change of his literary style: in it he forsook the so-called naturalistic novel for analysis of moral motives. He is at his best in presenting cases of conscience, the struggle between passion and duty, and the virtues of renunciation. &quot;Le Sens de la vie&quot; (1889), one of his most famous books, is a complement to &quot;La Course à la mort&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Les Trois cœurs&quot; (1890), &quot;Le Sacrifice&quot; (1892), &quot;La Vie privée de Michel Teissier&quot; (1893), translated as &quot;The Private Life of an Eminent Politician&quot; (1893); &quot;La Seconde Vie de Michel Teissier&quot; (1894), &quot;Le Silence&quot; (1894), &quot;Les Roches blanches&quot; (1895), &quot;Le Dernier Refuge&quot; (1896), &quot;Le Ménage du pasteur Naudi&quot; (1898), a study of Protestant France; &quot;L&#x27;eau courante&quot; (1902), &quot;L&#x27;Inutile effort&quot; (1903), &quot;Un Vainqueur&quot; (1904), &quot;L&#x27;Indocile&quot; (1905), and &quot;L&#x27;Incendie&quot; (1906). M. Rod&#x27;s books of literary criticism include &quot;Les Idées morales du temps présent&quot; (1897), &quot;Essai sur Goethe&quot; (1898), &quot;Stendhal&quot; (1892), and some collected essays. He published &quot;L&#x27;Affaire J.-J. Rousseau&quot; in 1906, and in the same year he produced from an episode in the life of that philosopher a play of three acts, &quot;Le Réformateur&quot;, which was produced at the Nouveau-Théâtre in Paris.

He died in the southeastern French town of Grasse in January 1910.

==Comment==
Although liked by Tolstoy, Chekhov was not impressed by Rod. From the letters of Anton Chekhov, to Suvorin, 24 July 1891:

:You once praised Rod, a French writer, and told me Tolstoy liked him. The other day I happened to read a novel of his and flung up my hands in amazement. He is equivalent to our Matchtet, only a little more intelligent. There is a terrible deal of affectation, dreariness, straining after originality, and as little of anything artistic as there was salt in that porridge we cooked in the evening at Bogimovo. In the preface, this Rod regrets that he was in the past a “naturalist,” and rejoices that the spiritualism of the latest recruits of literature has replaced materialism. Boyish boastfulness which is at the same time coarse and clumsy... “If we are not as talented as you, Monsieur Zola, to make up for it we believe in God.”

<text>James Gurney (born June 14, 1958) is an American artist and author known for his illustrated book series &quot;Dinotopia&quot;, which is presented in the form of a 19th-century explorer&#x27;s 
journal from an island utopia cohabited by humans and dinosaurs. 

Gurney is also a paleoartist who depicts and restores in his paintings extinct fauna such as both avian and non-avian dinosaurs.

==Life and education==
James Gurney was born on June 14, 1958, in Glendale, California. He grew up in Palo Alto, California, the youngest of five children of Joanna and Robert Gurney, a mechanical engineer. 

Growing up, he showed great interest in dinosaurs but found few books on the subject in his local library or school. The first dinosaur fossil he saw was that of an Allosaurus at a museum. His fascination with dinosaurs led to an interest in archaeology. As a youth, he dug up his home&#x27;s back yard looking for arrowheads or lost temples.

He studied anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, receiving a bachelor of arts degree with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1979. He then studied illustration at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, for a couple of semesters. 

Gurney met his wife, fellow artist Jeanette, as a sketching partner in Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, California. Together they moved to the Hudson Valley of New York, where they raised their two sons. Gurney welcomed his family around when painting, setting up a play space in the studio near his painting table. The couple are still avid outdoor painters, living in a small town in the Hudson Valley.

==Career==
Prompted by a cross-country adventure on freight trains, he and Thomas Kinkade coauthored &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Guide to Sketching&quot; in 1982. 

Gurney and Kinkade also worked as painters of background scenes for the animated film &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (1983), co-produced by Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta.

Gurney&#x27;s freelance illustration career began in the 1980s, during which time he developed his characteristic realistic renderings of fantastic scenes, painted in oil using methods similar to the academic realists and Golden Age illustrators. He painted more than 70 covers for science fiction and fantasy paperback novels, and he created several stamp designs for the U.S. Postal Service, most notably &quot;The World of Dinosaurs&quot; in 1996.

Starting in 1983, he began work on over a dozen assignments for &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, including reconstructions of the ancient Moche, Kushite, and Etruscan civilizations, and the Jason and Ulysses voyages for Tim Severin.

The inspiration that came from researching these archaeological reconstructions led to a series of lost-world panoramas, including &quot;Waterfall City&quot; (1988) and &quot;Dinosaur Parade&quot; (1989).

With the encouragement of retired publishers Ian and Betty Ballantine, he discontinued his freelance work and committed two years&#x27; time to writing and illustrating &quot;Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time&quot;, published in 1992. The book made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestseller List, and won Hugo, World Fantasy, Chesley, Spectrum, and Colorado Children&#x27;s Book awards. It sold over a million copies and was translated into 18 languages.

Sequels of &quot;Dinotopia&quot; that are both written and illustrated by Gurney include &quot;Dinotopia: The World Beneath&quot; (1995), &quot;Dinotopia: First Flight&quot; (1999), and &quot;Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara&quot; (2007). 

Original artwork by Gurney from the &quot;Dinotopia&quot; books has been exhibited at the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution, the Norman Rockwell Museum, the Royal Tyrrell Museum and is currently on tour to museums throughout the United States and Europe.

Most recently, he has written two art-instruction books: &quot;Imaginative Realism: How to Paint What Doesn&#x27;t Exist&quot; (2009), a book about drawing and painting things that do not exist; and &quot;Color and Light: A Guide for the Realist Painter&quot; (2010). These books are based upon Gurney&#x27;s blog posts, in which he gives practical advice to realist and fantasy artists. 

On February 21, 2012, Gurney was inducted as a Living Master by the Art Renewal Center.

The dinosaur &quot;Torvosaurus gurneyi&quot; was named in honor of Gurney in 2014.

<text>Aram-Naharaim ( &quot;ʾĂram Nahărayim&quot;) is the biblical term for an ancient land along the great bend of the Euphrates River. 

It is mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament. In Genesis, it is used somewhat interchangeably with the names &quot;Paddan Aram&quot; and &quot;Haran&quot; to denote the place where Abraham stayed briefly with his father Terah&#x27;s family after leaving Ur of the Chaldees, while &quot;en route&quot; to Canaan (Gen. 11:31), and the place from which later patriarchs obtained wives, rather than marry daughters of Canaan.

Both the Septuagint (early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) and Flavius Josephus translate the name as &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;. Ancient writers later used the name &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; for all of the land between the Tigris and Euphrates. However, the usage of the Hebrew name &quot;Aram-Naharaim&quot; does not match this later usage of &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;, the Hebrew term referring to a northern region within Mesopotamia.

The translation of the name as &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; was not consistent – the Septuagint also uses a more precise translation &quot;Mesopotamia of Syria&quot; as well as &quot;Rivers of Syria&quot;.

<doc id="617121" wikidata="Q65122115" url="?curid=617121" title="Game semantics">
<text>Game semantics (, translated as &quot;dialogical logic&quot;) is an approach to formal semantics that grounds the concepts of truth or validity on game-theoretic concepts, such as the existence of a winning strategy for a player, somewhat resembling Socratic dialogues or medieval theory of Obligationes.

==History==
In the late 1950s Paul Lorenzen was the first to introduce a game semantics for logic, and it was further developed by Kuno Lorenz. At almost the same time as Lorenzen, Jaakko Hintikka developed a model-theoretical approach known in the literature as &quot;GTS&quot; (game-theoretical semantics). Since then, a number of different game semantics have been studied in logic.

Shahid Rahman (Lille III) and collaborators developed dialogical logic into a general framework for the study of logical and philosophical issues related to logical pluralism. Beginning 1994 this triggered a kind of renaissance with lasting consequences. This new philosophical impulse experienced a parallel renewal in the fields of theoretical computer science, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and the formal semantics of programming languages, for instance the work of Johan van Benthem and collaborators in Amsterdam who looked thoroughly at the interface between logic and games, and Hanno Nickau who addressed the full abstraction problem in programming languages by means of games. New results in linear logic by Jean-Yves Girard in the interfaces between mathematical game theory and logic on one hand and argumentation theory and logic on the other hand resulted in the work of many others, including S. Abramsky, J. van Benthem, A. Blass, D. Gabbay, M. Hyland, W. Hodges, R. Jagadeesan, G. Japaridze, E. Krabbe, L. Ong, H. Prakken, G. Sandu, D. Walton, and J. Woods, who placed game semantics at the center of a new concept in logic in which logic is understood as a dynamic instrument of inference. There has also been an alternative perspective on proof theory and meaning theory, advocating that Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;meaning as use&quot; paradigm as understood in the context of proof theory, where the so-called reduction rules (showing the effect of elimination rules on the result of introduction rules) should be seen as appropriate to formalise the explanation of the (immediate) consequences one can draw from a proposition, thus showing the function/purpose/usefulness of its main connective in the calculus of language (, , , , , ).

==Classical logic==
The simplest application of game semantics is to propositional logic. Each formula of this language is interpreted as a game between two players, known as the &quot;Verifier&quot; and the &quot;Falsifier&quot;. The Verifier is given &quot;ownership&quot; of all the disjunctions in the formula, and the Falsifier is likewise given ownership of all the conjunctions. Each move of the game consists of allowing the owner of the principal connective to pick one of its branches; play will then continue in that subformula, with whichever player controls its principal connective making the next move. Play ends when a primitive proposition has been so chosen by the two players; at this point the Verifier is deemed the winner if the resulting proposition is true, and the Falsifier is deemed the winner if it is false. The original formula will be considered true precisely when the Verifier has a winning strategy, while it will be false whenever the Falsifier has the winning strategy.

If the formula contains negations or implications, other, more complicated, techniques may be used. For example, a negation should be true if the thing negated is false, so it must have the effect of interchanging the roles of the two players.

More generally, game semantics may be applied to predicate logic; the new rules allow a principal quantifier to be removed by its &quot;owner&quot; (the Verifier for existential quantifiers and the Falsifier for universal quantifiers) and its bound variable replaced at all occurrences by an object of the owner&#x27;s choosing, drawn from the domain of quantification. Note that a single counterexample falsifies a universally quantified statement, and a single example suffices to verify an existentially quantified one. Assuming the axiom of choice, the game-theoretical semantics for classical first-order logic agree with the usual model-based (Tarskian) semantics. For classical first-order logic the winning strategy for the Verifier essentially consists of finding adequate Skolem functions and witnesses. For example, if &quot;S&quot; denotes formula_1 then an equisatisfiable statement for &quot;S&quot; is formula_2. The Skolem function &quot;f&quot; (if it exists) actually codifies a winning strategy for the Verifier of &quot;S&quot; by returning a witness for the existential sub-formula for every choice of &quot;x&quot; the Falsifier might make.

The above definition was first formulated by Jaakko Hintikka as part of his GTS interpretation. The original version of game semantics for classical (and intuitionistic) logic due to Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz was not defined in terms of models but of winning strategies over &quot;formal dialogues&quot; (P. Lorenzen, K. Lorenz 1978, S. Rahman and L. Keiff 2005). Shahid Rahman and Tero Tulenheimo developed an algorithm to convert GTS-winning strategies for classical logic into the dialogical winning strategies and vice versa.

Formal dialogues and GTS games may be infinite and use end-of-play rules rather than letting players decide when to stop playing. Reaching this decision by standard means for strategic inferences (iterated elimination of dominated strategies or IEDS) would, in GTS and formal dialogues, be equivalent to solving the halting problem and exceeds the reasoning abilities of human agents. GTS avoids this with a rule to test formulas against an underlying model; logical dialogues, with a non-repetition rule (similar to threefold repetition in Chess). Genot and Jacot (2017) proved that players with severely bounded rationality can reason to terminate a play without IEDS.

For most common logics, including the ones above, the games that arise from them have perfect information—that is, the two players always know the truth values of each primitive, and are aware of all preceding moves in the game. However, with the advent of game semantics, logics, such as the independence-friendly logic of Hintikka and Sandu, with a natural semantics in terms of games of imperfect information have been proposed.

== Intuitionistic logic, denotational semantics, linear logic, logical pluralism ==
The primary motivation for Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz was to find a game-theoretic (their term was &quot;dialogical&quot;, in German ) semantics for intuitionistic logic. Andreas Blass was the first to point out connections between game semantics and linear logic. This line was further developed by Samson Abramsky, Radhakrishnan Jagadeesan, Pasquale Malacaria and independently Martin Hyland and Luke Ong, who placed special emphasis on compositionality, i.e. the definition of strategies inductively on the syntax. Using game semantics, the authors mentioned above have solved the long-standing problem of defining a fully abstract model for the programming language PCF. Consequently, game semantics has led to fully abstract semantic models for a variety of programming languages, and to new semantic-directed methods of software verification by software model checking.

 and Helge Rückert extended the dialogical approach to the study of several non-classical logics such as modal logic, relevance logic, free logic and connexive logic. Recently, Rahman and collaborators developed the dialogical approach into a general framework aimed at the discussion of logical pluralism.

== Quantifiers ==
Foundational considerations of game semantics have been more emphasised by Jaakko Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu, especially for independence-friendly logic (IF logic, more recently &quot;information&quot;-friendly logic), a logic with branching quantifiers. It was thought that the principle of compositionality fails for these logics, so that a Tarskian truth definition could not provide a suitable semantics. To get around this problem, the quantifiers were given a game-theoretic meaning. Specifically, the approach is the same as in classical propositional logic, except that the players do not always have perfect information about previous moves by the other player. Wilfrid Hodges has proposed a compositional semantics and proved it equivalent to game semantics for IF-logics.

More recently and the team of dialogical logic in Lille implemented dependences and independences within a dialogical framework by means of a dialogical approach to intuitionistic type theory called &quot;immanent reasoning&quot;.

== Computability logic == 
Japaridze’s computability logic is a game-semantical approach to logic in an extreme sense, treating games as targets to be serviced by logic rather than as technical or foundational means for studying or justifying logic. Its starting philosophical point is that logic is meant to be a universal, general-utility intellectual tool for ‘navigating the real world’ and, as such, it should be construed semantically rather than syntactically, because it is semantics that serves as a bridge between real world and otherwise meaningless formal systems (syntax). Syntax is thus secondary, interesting only as much as it services the underlying semantics. From this standpoint, Japaridze has repeatedly criticized the often followed practice of adjusting semantics to some already existing target syntactic constructions, with Lorenzen’s approach to intuitionistic logic being an example. This line of thought then proceeds to argue that the semantics, in turn, should be a game semantics, because games “offer the most comprehensive, coherent, natural, adequate and convenient mathematical models for the very essence of all ‘navigational’ activities of agents: their interactions with the surrounding world”. Accordingly, the logic-building paradigm adopted by computability logic is to identify the most natural and basic operations on games, treat those operators as logical operations, and then look for sound and complete axiomatizations of the sets of game-semantically valid formulas. On this path a host of familiar or unfamiliar logical operators have emerged in the open-ended language of computability logic, with several sorts of negations, conjunctions, disjunctions, implications, quantifiers and modalities. 

Games are played between two agents: a machine and its environment, where the machine is required to follow only computable strategies. This way, games are seen as interactive computational problems, and the machine&#x27;s winning strategies for them as solutions to those problems. It has been established that computability logic is robust with respect to reasonable variations in the complexity of allowed strategies, which can be brought down as low as logarithmic space and polynomial time (one does not imply the other in interactive computations) without affecting the logic. All this explains the name “computability logic” and determines applicability in various areas of computer science. Classical logic, independence-friendly logic and certain extensions of linear and intuitionistic logics turn out to be special fragments of computability logic, obtained merely by disallowing certain groups of operators or atoms.

<text>A beth midrash (, &quot;House of Learning&quot;; : &quot;batei midrash&quot;), also beis medrash or beit midrash, is a hall dedicated for Torah study, often translated as a &quot;study hall&quot;. It is distinct from a synagogue (&quot;beth knesseth&quot;), although the two are often coextensive. In Yiddish the &quot;beth midrash&quot; may be referred to as a &quot;zal&quot;, i.e. &quot;hall&quot;. &quot;Beis midrash&quot; can also refer to a yeshiva gedolah, the undergraduate-level program in Orthodoxy, for boys over 12th grade.

The Arabic term &quot;madrasah&quot; is derived from the same Semitic root, and refers to any type of educational institution. The root דרש means &quot;to seek [knowledge]&quot; and is then generalized to mean &quot;expound&quot;.

==History==
Early rabbinic literature, including the Mishnah, makes mention of the &quot;beth midrash&quot; as an institution distinct from the &quot;beth din&quot; and Sanhedrin. It was meant as a place of Torah study and interpretation, as well as the development of &quot;halakha&quot; (the practical application of the Jewish Law).

The origin of the &quot;beth midrash&quot;, or &quot;house of study&quot;, can be traced to the early rabbinic period, following the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE) in which the destruction of the Temple took place. The earliest known rabbinical school was established by Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai at Yavne. Other official schools were soon established under different rabbis. These men traced their ideological roots back to the rabbis of the late Second Temple period, specifically the Houses of Hillel and Shammai, two schools of thought.

By late antiquity, the &quot;beth midrash&quot; had developed along with the synagogue into a distinct though somewhat related institution. The main difference between the &quot;beth midrash&quot; and &quot;beth ha-keneseth&quot; (synagogue) is that the &quot;beth ha-keneseth&quot; is sanctified for prayer only and that even the study of Torah would violate its sanctity while in the &quot;beth midrash&quot; both Torah study and prayer are allowed. For this reason most synagogues designate their sanctuary as a &quot;beth midrash&quot; so that in addition to prayer the study of the Torah would also be permitted.

==Structure==
There are generally either benches or chairs for sitting, along with tables on which books are placed. In Lithuanian yeshivas the &quot;beth midrash&quot; will have &quot;shtenders&quot; (standing desks resembling lecterns; the Yiddish word is derived from the German &quot;Ständer&quot;).

A characteristic &quot;beth midrash&quot; has many hundreds of books, including at least several copies of the entire Talmud, Torah, Tanach, &quot;siddurim&quot; (prayer books), &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot;, &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot;, &quot;Aruch HaShulchan&quot; and other frequently consulted works.

In modern times, &quot;batei midrash&quot; are typically found as the central study halls of yeshivas or independent &quot;kollels&quot;, both institutions of Torah study. The location and institution of study are often interchanged, so in popular parlance, yeshivot are sometimes referred to as &quot;batei midrash&quot;. A &quot;beth midrash&quot; may also be housed in a synagogue, or vice versa. In antiquity, this is a matter of debate (see below). Many &quot;batei midrash&quot; originally serve the community but attract a yeshiva in the course of their existence.

==Virtual ==
A virtual is an online forum that provides articles for self-study and live, online classes, which sometimes makes use of &quot;breakout groups&quot; to provide for &quot;chavrusa-style&quot; learning typical of a traditional beth midrash study hall.

<text>Joseph Francis Buck (born April 25, 1969) is an American sportscaster for ESPN. 

The son of sportscaster Jack Buck, he worked for Fox Sports from its 1994 inception through 2022, including roles as lead play-by-play announcer for Fox&#x27;s National Football League and Major League Baseball coverage. He served as a television play-by-play announcer for the World Series over a 25-year span from 1996 to 2021 (with the exceptions of 1997 and 1999, in which Bob Costas called those particular World Series for NBC). 

In 2022, Buck moved to ESPN from Fox Sports. He is the lead play-by-play announcer for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Buck was born in St. Petersburg, Florida (where the St. Louis Cardinals—for whom his father, Jack Buck, broadcast—then conducted their spring training), and raised in the St. Louis area, where he attended St. Louis Country Day School. He began his broadcasting career in 1989 while he was an undergraduate at Indiana University Bloomington.

==Career==

===Before Fox===
Buck called play-by-play for the then-Louisville Redbirds, a minor league affiliate of the Cardinals, and was a reporter for ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the Triple-A All-Star Game in 1989. In 1991, he did reporting for St Louis&#x27; CBS affiliate KMOV. Also, in 1991 Buck began broadcasting for the Cardinals on local television and KMOX Radio, filling in while his father was working on CBS telecasts. In the 1992–93 season, he was the play-by-play voice for University of Missouri basketball broadcasts.

Buck continued to call Cardinals games after being hired by Fox Sports, initially with his father on KMOX and later on FSN Midwest television. As his network duties increased, however, his local workload shrank, and before the 2008 season, it was announced that he would no longer be calling Cardinals telecasts for FSN Midwest. This marked the first time since 1960 that a member of the Buck family was not part of the team&#x27;s broadcasting crew.

=== Fox Sports (1994–2021) ===

====Hiring at Fox====
In 1994, Buck was hired by Fox, and at the age of 25 became the youngest man ever to announce a regular slate of National Football League (NFL) games on network television.

====&quot;Major League Baseball on Fox&quot;====

In 1996, he was named Fox&#x27;s lead play-by-play voice for Major League Baseball, teaming with Tim McCarver, who had previously worked with his father on CBS. That year, he became the youngest man to do a national broadcast (for all nine innings and games, as a network employee as opposed to simply being a representative of one of the participating teams) for a World Series, surpassing Sean McDonough, who called the 1992 World Series for CBS at the age of 30. McDonough had replaced Jack Buck as CBS&#x27;s lead baseball play-by-play man after he was fired in late 1991.

On September 8, 1998, Buck called Mark McGwire&#x27;s 62nd home run that broke Roger Maris&#x27; single-season record. The game was nationally televised live in prime time on Fox. It was a rarity for a nationally televised regular season game not to be aired on cable since the end of the &quot;Monday&quot;/&quot;Thursday Night Baseball&quot; era on ABC in 1989.

During Fox&#x27;s broadcast of the 2002 World Series, Buck paid implicit tribute to his father, who had died a few months earlier (he had read the eulogy at his father&#x27;s funeral) by calling the final out of Game 6 (which tied the series at 3–3, and thus ensured there would be a Game 7 broadcast the next night) with the phrase, &quot;We&#x27;ll see you tomorrow night.&quot; This was the same phrase with which Jack Buck had famously called Kirby Puckett&#x27;s home run off Braves pitcher Charlie Leibrandt, which ended Game 6 of the 1991 World Series. Since then, Joe has continued to use this phrase at appropriate times, including Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS, in which the Boston Red Sox famously rallied off New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera in the 9th inning to avoid elimination. When David Ortiz&#x27;s walk-off home run finally won it for the Red Sox in the 12th inning, Buck uttered, &quot;We&#x27;ll see you later tonight,&quot; alluding to the fact that the game had extended into the early morning. He also used the phrase at the end of Game 6 of the 2011 World Series when the Cardinals&#x27; David Freese hit a walk-off home run in the 11th inning against the Rangers to send the series to a seventh game (it was 20 years and a day since Kirby Puckett&#x27;s home run). The similarity of both the call and the game situation resulted in mentions on national news broadcasts.

Another notable Red Sox game in the ALCS was in , Game 2 against the Detroit Tigers at Fenway Park. The Red Sox were trailing 5–1 in the bottom of the eighth inning, with the bases loaded with David Ortiz at-bat. Ortiz hit a game-tying grand slam off Tigers&#x27; closer Joaquín Benoit. His call: &quot;Hard hit into right, back at the wall,&quot; and then he calls, &quot;TIE GAME!&quot; as the ball flies over Torii Hunter, who flipped over the outfield wall.

Later with Fox, Buck called a limited selection of regular-season games each year (typically featuring big-market teams such as the Yankees, Red Sox, Dodgers, Cardinals in which he called games for, and/or Cubs), as well as the All-Star Game, one of the League Championship Series, and the World Series. From 2016 to 2021, he was paired with color analyst John Smoltz and field reporter Ken Rosenthal. Besides working with Tim McCarver for 18 seasons (1996–2013), Buck also worked with former MLB player and current MLB Network/Fox Sports analyst Harold Reynolds and baseball insider Tom Verducci for 2 seasons (2014–2015). About a month or two after the 2015 World Series, Reynolds and Verducci were demoted to the #2 team and John Smoltz moved up from the #2 team (with Matt Vasgersian) to take Reynolds and Verducci&#x27;s places.

From 1996 to 2021, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games for Fox, the most of any play-by-play announcer on network television.

As the lead play-by-play announcer for MLB on Fox, Buck called games between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox that were broadcast on Fox and FS1. He called many notable moments in the rivalry, including Aaron Boone&#x27;s walk off home run in Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS, saying &quot;The Boston Red Sox...were five outs away in the eighth inning, leading by three, as Boone hits it to deep left. That might send the Yankees to the World Series. Boone the hero of Game 7!&quot;

====&quot;NFL on Fox&quot;====
Soon after arriving at Fox, Buck became the play-by-play man on Fox&#x27;s #4 NFL broadcast team, with Tim Green as his color commentator. After three years, he stopped doing NFL games to concentrate on his baseball duties full-time. During the 2001 season, Buck occasionally filled in for Curt Menefee as Fox&#x27;s number-six play-by-play man.

Buck became Fox&#x27;s top play-by-play man in 2002, replacing Pat Summerall. For many seasons, he was teamed with Troy Aikman as color commentator and Erin Andrews as the sideline reporter. (Buck also worked with Cris Collinsworth from 2002 to 2004, before the latter&#x27;s move to Showtime, NFL Network, and NBC.) Buck is only the third announcer to handle a television network&#x27;s lead MLB and NFL coverage in the same year (following NBC&#x27;s Curt Gowdy and ABC&#x27;s Al Michaels). By 2002, his Fox duties forced him to cut his local Cardinals schedule to 25 games. (Eventually, Buck left the Cardinals altogether to join Fox Sports &quot;full-time&quot; in 2008.) Notable games he called included Super Bowl XLII, Miracle at the New Meadowlands, Super Bowl LI, the Minneapolis Miracle, and the final Green Bay Packers home game in Milwaukee at County Stadium.

During the 2006 season, Buck briefly hosted Fox&#x27;s pre-game show &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;, with him and Curt Menefee jointly replacing James Brown. To accommodate his involvement, the show began to broadcast on-site from the location of Fox&#x27;s top game of the week. In 2007, Buck stepped down as host to focus on his play-by-play duties, and &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; reverted to primarily being broadcast from Fox Sports&#x27; studios in Los Angeles.

====Two-sport, same-day doubleheader====
On October 14, 2012, Buck called a doubleheader, first with the New York Giants-San Francisco 49ers game at Candlestick Park at 1:25 PM PDT, then traveled via trolley for the seven-mile journey up the west shore of the San Francisco Bay to call Game 1 of the NLCS between the St. Louis Cardinals and the San Francisco Giants at AT&amp;T Park at 5:15 PM PDT.

The opportunity presented itself again on October 28, 2018, when Fox would carry the Green Bay Packers and Los Angeles Rams from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as its featured NFL game before Game 5 of the 2018 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers, to be played five miles away at Dodger Stadium. However, Buck chose to concentrate on baseball, citing traffic concerns in Los Angeles and already being busy calling the NFL and MLB simultaneously. Thom Brennaman, who had served as Buck&#x27;s fill-in during the MLB postseason in the past, handled the Packers-Rams game.

====USGA tournaments====
In April 2014, it was announced that Buck would team with Greg Norman to anchor Fox&#x27;s new package of United States Golf Association telecasts, most prominently the U.S. Open tournament. The pair made their broadcast debut at the Franklin Templeton Shootout (an event also hosted by Norman) on December 12–14, 2014. Norman was fired by Fox and replaced with Paul Azinger in 2016.

===HBO Sports (2009–2010)===
On February 5, 2009, Buck signed with HBO to host a sports-based talk show for the network called &quot;Joe Buck Live&quot;, with a format similar to that of &quot;Costas Now&quot;, the monthly HBO program previously hosted by Bob Costas.
The show&#x27;s debut on June 15, 2009, made national headlines due to the tension-filled banter between Buck and guest Artie Lange, a comedian from &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, who made several jokes at Buck&#x27;s expense. Two more episodes aired in 2009. In March 2010, Buck told a St. Louis radio station that HBO might be planning to cancel &quot;Joe Buck Live&quot;, adding that he &quot;won&#x27;t miss&quot; the program and that it involved &quot;a lot more effort and hassle than I ever expected&quot;. HBO subsequently confirmed the show&#x27;s cancellation to &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot;.

===ESPN/ABC (2022–present)===
On March 16, 2022, ESPN announced that it had signed Buck and Aikman to a multi-year deal with ESPN, which saw them become the new lead broadcast team of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; beginning in the 2022 NFL season, and also work on projects for ESPN+. The move ended their 20-season tenure as Fox&#x27;s lead NFL broadcast team. As compensation for Buck leaving Fox Sports with one year left on his contract, ESPN sublicensed one of its Big Ten college football games for the 2022 season to Fox.

In May 2022, Buck made his on-air debut at ESPN during the 2022 PGA Championship, hosting an alternate broadcast on ESPN2 and ESPN+ produced by Peyton and Eli Manning, featuring ESPN golf analyst Michael Collins and other celebrity guests.

In 2022, Buck was offered to fill in for an ESPN-broadcast MLB game as well, but declined, telling a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; podcast that he was no longer interested in calling baseball, since &quot;I feel like I&#x27;ve done all I could do there. If someday I wanna go back and call a few games—maybe. But I don&#x27;t have that itch.&quot; In 2025, ESPN announced that Buck would call an MLB Opening Day game that season featuring the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Yankees.

===Other notable appearances===
In the late 1990s, Buck hosted a weekly sports news show, &quot;Goin&#x27; Deep&quot;, for Fox Sports Net cable. He also called horse racing and professional bass fishing events early in his Fox career, as well as the network&#x27;s first Cotton Bowl Classic telecast in 1999.

Since 2001, Buck has hosted the &quot;Joe Buck Classic&quot;, a celebrity pro-am golf tournament that is played each May to raise money for St. Louis Children&#x27;s Hospital.

In 2007, Buck filmed a pilot episode for a prospective late-night talk and comedy program with former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer and director Matt Piedmont. Piedmont and Buck wrote and produced the pilot with Piedmont directing, filming in New York City and Los Angeles, and featuring Molly Shannon, David Spade, and Paul Rudd. Buck co-hosted the program with Abebe Adusmussui, an actual New York City taxi driver. The pilot was not picked up as a series, however.

Buck has also appeared in various national television commercials for such clients as Holiday Inn and Budweiser beer. One of the more memorable spots for the latter had Buck goaded into using the catchphrase, &quot;Slamma-lamma-ding-dong!&quot; A 2008 commercial for National Car Rental had him using the catchphrase, &quot;Now that&#x27;s a good call&quot;. Buck has also done local commercials in the St. Louis market for the Suntrup chain of automobile dealerships.

He also contributes occasional opinion pieces to &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and is a key contributor on KSLG/Team 1380 on the &quot;ITD Morning After&quot; program in St. Louis.

In the week before calling Super Bowl XLVIII, Buck starred in a Web video for &quot;Funny or Die&quot; in which he tries to report on the game from New York City but continues to get interrupted by locals who dislike him.

On February 12, 2013, Buck made a guest appearance during Fox Sports Midwest&#x27;s broadcast of a St. Louis Blues hockey game. Alongside their current commentators Darren Pang and John Kelly, he discussed his father Jack Buck having called Blues hockey along with Kelly&#x27;s father Dan in the late 1960s. Buck briefly took over play-by-play from Pang and Kelly, stepping aside when the Los Angeles Kings inevitably scored a power-play goal on the Blues (joking in response that &quot;I clearly bring no mojo to the party&quot;).

In 2014, Buck was named as the new host of &quot;NFL Films Presents&quot;, to coincide with the program&#x27;s move from ESPN2 to Fox Sports 1.

From 2015 to 2018, Buck hosted &quot;Undeniable with Joe Buck&quot;, a sports interview series on Audience Network.

Buck published an autobiography, &quot;Lucky Bastard&quot;, in 2016.

He has appeared in several television programs as himself, including &quot;Pitch&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Conan&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, and &quot;Brockmire&quot;; the film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (also starring Jimmy Fallon); and in the &quot;Carpet Brothers&quot; sketch on &quot;Funny or Die Presents&quot; as The Legit Don Stritt. Buck&#x27;s voice is also heard in recorded conversations between Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky calling Game 5 of the Yankees-Indians ALDS in 1997. The tapes were released at the height of the scandal involving Lewinsky and President Bill Clinton.

Andrew Marchand of the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported on April 17, 2021, that Buck would serve as a guest host on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; as the game show continues to search for a replacement after the death of longtime host Alex Trebek. Sony Pictures Television confirmed four days later that Buck&#x27;s stint would air from August 9 to 13.

In 2021, Buck and his family appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;, competing against the family of actor Oliver Hudson.

In 2022, Buck became the announcer on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Domino Masters&quot; hosted by Eric Stonestreet. Buck also competed in season seven of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Ram&quot; of Team Bad. He was unmasked in the competition&#x27;s second week at the time when Stonestreet was a guest panelist as he and Robin Thicke correctly guessed Buck during the final guesses.

On May 24, 2024, Buck was scheduled to call a Cardinals-Cubs baseball game on Bally Sports Midwest alongside his close friend Chip Caray. It would have marked the first time Buck had called a baseball game since the 2021 World Series. However, the game was rained out. He returned to the booth and called a Cardinals-Rangers game with Chip Caray on July 29, 2024.

== Criticism and controversies ==
Buck is generally regarded as &quot;one of the most heavily criticized&quot; announcers in sports, with various fans complaining that he is biased on his calls towards or against particular teams. Buck attributes this to the fact that most fan bases, especially Major League Baseball fans, are used to hearing local announcers and not those working national broadcasts: &quot;Fans are used to hearing their hometown guys. When you come at it objectively, people aren&#x27;t used to it.&quot;

Reporting from the field following the game in which Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris&#x27; single-season home run record in 1998, Buck began his postgame interview on Fox by requesting (and getting) a hug from McGwire, which led to criticisms of Buck&#x27;s on-air professionalism from some sources.

In January 2005, Buck drew fire for his on-air comments during an NFL playoff game between the Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers. After Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss simulated mooning the Green Bay crowd in the end zone, Buck called it a &quot;disgusting act&quot;. The moon was a response to Packers fans, who traditionally moon the Vikings players aboard the team bus, which Buck did not know about. Buck&#x27;s comment also indicated that he incorrectly believed that Moss had mooned the fans. It prompted Red McCombs, then the owner of the Minnesota Vikings, to request that Buck be removed from covering their upcoming playoff game, saying that Buck&#x27;s comments &quot;suggested a prejudice that surpassed objective reporting.&quot; Buck also received criticism from other members of the media who felt he &quot;over-reacted&quot; and was being &quot;inconsistent&quot; given his network&#x27;s history of programming. Buck was much more restrained in his call of the New York Jets&#x27; Isaiah Crowell using the football to simulate cleaning himself after defecation during a 2018 &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; contest against the Cleveland Browns. &quot;That will draw a flag every time,&quot; Buck simply commented.

In 2007, Buck was scheduled to call only eight regular-season MLB games out of a 26-game schedule for Fox (along with a handful of regional Cardinals telecasts on FSN Midwest). In an interview with Richard Sandomir of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, he defended his reduced baseball commitment: 

In 2008, Buck drew criticism for comments he made during an appearance on ESPN Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Herd with Colin Cowherd&quot;, in which he admitted to spending &quot;barely any&quot; time following sporting events he doesn&#x27;t broadcast and facetiously claimed that he preferred watching &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; instead.

In June 2015, Buck announced he had quit his Twitter account. Buck explained that he quit Twitter because he found himself engaging negative people and allowing criticism to affect how he was doing his job. He would return to Twitter four months later to engage in friendly banter with a Kansas City Royals fan who started a petition to have him removed from the Fox broadcast team for the Royals&#x27; appearance in the 2015 ALCS.

Also in June 2015, Buck and co-announcer Greg Norman were criticized for their &quot;mistake-filled, error-prone mess&quot; in covering the 2015 U.S. Open in golf. In particular, they were questioned for prematurely anointing Dustin Johnson as the winner &quot;at the start of a back nine&quot;.

Before a 2020 NFL broadcast between the Packers and Buccaneers in Tampa, Buck and his partner Troy Aikman were caught on a hot mic questioning the necessity of a military flyover when only 15,000 fans were allowed in Raymond James Stadium for the game. &quot;That&#x27;s your hard-earned money and your tax dollars at work,&quot; Buck commented. An Armed Forces spokesperson later said there is no additional cost to conduct the flyovers. Meanwhile, Buck and Aikman faced accusations of being unpatriotic. Joe Buck said the comments were taken out of context and were sarcasm not meant for broadcast.

On January 2, 2023, Buck served as the announcer for a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals in which Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Buck claimed four times on the broadcast that despite the life-threatening injury, he had been told the league was adamant to resume play within minutes. The NFL&#x27;s executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent denied the claims, saying those plans were never relayed to Buck and called his comments &quot;insensitive&quot;. The following day, Buck responded to the NFL and Vincent, and stood by the claim that he was told both teams had five minutes to warm-up before resuming the game. A similar report regarding the players warming-up to resume play was aired on Westwood One.

==Personal life==
From 1993 to 2011, Buck was married to Ann Archambault, with whom he has two daughters. He married NFL Network and now ESPN reporter and former Bronco cheerleader Michelle Beisner on April 12, 2014. They have twin sons. The couple reside in Ladue, Missouri.

Buck is a fan and season ticket holder of the NHL&#x27;s St. Louis Blues. He revealed in a tweet in 2023 that he was a Houston Oilers fan growing up, and he supports St. Louis Cardinals in baseball.

=== Vocal cord ailment ===
In 2011, shortly after broadcasting Super Bowl XLV for Fox, Buck claimed to have developed a virus on the nerves of his left vocal fold. Despite the ailment, which according to Buck &quot;came out of the blue&quot; and hampered his ability to raise his voice, he continued to broadcast baseball for Fox during the 2011 season and resumed as Fox&#x27;s lead NFL announcer that fall.

In 2016, Buck revealed that the problem was not due to a virus, but rather to vocal cord paralysis likely caused by anesthesia used during multiple hair transplantation procedures.

<text>Baccio Pontelli (c. 1449 – c. 1494) was an Italian architect and worker in wood inlays, who designed the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. Baccio is an abbreviation of Bartolomeo.

Pontelli was born in Florence; in 1459 his father declared he was ten years old. He trained in artistic woodwork such as marquetry in the workshop of Giuliano and Benedetto da Maiano in Florence, and was influenced by Francesco di Giorgio Martini during a trip to Urbino (1480–1482), where he worked on the Studiolo of Duke Federico de Montefeltro, in the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino. He worked in Florence and later in Urbino on inlays. 

Acting as an architect in Rome, he participated in the pope Sixtus IV&#x27;s urban renewal. His exact contributions are unclear; he was perhaps more given more work supervising construction than designing. The tendency of Giorgio Vasari to attribute most Papal building commissions in the period to his fellow-Florentine has rather confused matters. That said, his projects included: Santa Aurea and fortifications in Ostia; the Ponte Sisto in Rome; the hospital of Santo Spirito in Sassia; the church Sant&#x27;Agostino; the facade of Santa Maria del Popolo; San Pietro in Vincoli; Santi Apostoli and design for the Sistine Chapel. 

In the last years of his life he worked in the Marche region on the military fortresses of Acquaviva Picena Jesi, Osimo and Senigallia. In 1494 he is recorded working at various places in the Kingdom of Naples. He died at Urbino and is buried in the church of St Dominic it there, where a nephew placed an epitaph in 1577.

<text>Charles Quinton Murphy (July 12, 1959 – April 12, 2017) was an American stand-up comedian and actor. He was best known as a writer and cast member of the Comedy Central sketch-comedy series &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; as well as the co-star of the sitcom &quot;Black Jesus&quot;. He was the older brother of actor and comedian Eddie Murphy.

==Early life==
Murphy was born on July 12, 1959, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. His mother Lillian Murphy was a telephone operator and his father, Charles Edward Murphy, was a transit police officer, actor, and comedian.

As an adolescent, Murphy spent ten months in jail. In 1978 on the day of his release, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served for six years as a boiler technician.

==Career==
Murphy made his first film appearance in the 1970 comedy-drama film &quot;The Landlord&quot;. The film was shot in a neighborhood where Murphy lived and he appears in a brief scene as a boy stealing hubcaps. Murphy had minor roles in several films in the late 1980s and early 1990s and worked behind the scenes with hip hop group K-9 Posse, a duo composed of his half-brother Vernon Lynch Jr. and Wardell Mahone. On their 1988 self-titled debut, Murphy was credited as the album&#x27;s executive producer as well as songwriter on &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Brother&quot; and &quot;Say Who Say What.&quot; He also made an appearance in the video for the duo&#x27;s first single, &quot;This Beat Is Military.&quot; Murphy&#x27;s first major role in a motion picture was in the 1993 film &quot;CB4&quot;, playing the antagonist Gusto.

Murphy gained national attention as a recurring performer on &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, particularly in the &quot;Charlie Murphy&#x27;s True Hollywood Stories&quot; sketches. In these, Murphy recounts his misadventures as part of his brother&#x27;s entourage, including encounters with various celebrities such as Rick James and Prince. After &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; host Dave Chappelle left the show, Murphy and Donnell Rawlings hosted the &quot;lost episodes&quot; compiled from sketches produced before his departure.

In 2005, he appeared in &quot;King&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (alongside Anthony Anderson and Jay Mohr). In the film, Murphy portrayed Herb, a gay ex-con who is hired by King (Anderson) to fake his kidnapping. Murphy also did voiceovers for Budweiser radio commercials, provided the voice for Iraq War veteran/criminal Ed Wuncler III on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim series &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, and the voice for a pimp named Jizzy-B in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; and as an albino Black graffiti artist named White Mike in &quot;Marc Ecko&#x27;s Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure&quot;. Murphy provided the voice for Spock on the G4TV&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek 2.0&quot; shorts, and the dog in his younger brother Eddie&#x27;s 2007 film, &quot;Norbit&quot;.

On March 20, 2009, he began his own sketch comedy series &quot;Charlie Murphy&#x27;s Crash Comedy&quot; on Crackle. A stand-up special, &quot;Charlie Murphy: I Will Not Apologize&quot; premiered on Comedy Central in late February 2010.
Murphy also made special appearances in &quot;1000 Ways to Die&quot; and the TBS sitcom &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot; as Frank Kingston. In 2014–15, Murphy played Vic on the Adult Swim live-action show &quot;Black Jesus&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Murphy was a resident of Tewksbury Township, New Jersey. He was married to Tisha Taylor Murphy from 1997 until her death from cervical cancer in December 2009. The couple had two children together, and Murphy had a child from a previous relationship. He was a karate practitioner.

Murphy died from leukemia on April 12, 2017, at age 57 in New York City, New York.

The third-season premiere of &quot;Black Jesus&quot; and his brother&#x27;s film, &quot;Dolemite Is My Name&quot;, were dedicated to Murphy. Murphy was the one who piqued his brother&#x27;s interest in the biopic&#x27;s subject, Rudy Ray Moore.

<text>HMS &quot;Sirius&quot; (F40) was a of the Royal Navy (RN) built by H.M. Dockyard Portsmouth, and was the penultimate RN warship to be built there for a period of forty years, until Vosper Thornycroft built . &quot;Sirius&quot; was launched on 22 September 1964 and commissioned on 15 June 1966. The ship continued in front line service until February 1992.

==Construction==
&quot;Sirius&quot; was one of three &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates ordered in the Autumn of 1962 for the Royal Navy as part of the 1962–63 construction programme. The ship was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 9 August 1963, was launched on 22 September 1964 and was completed and commissioned on 15 June 1966.

&quot;Sirius&quot; was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was fitted with Y-136 machinery, built by J Samuel White. Two oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. The anti-aircraft defence was provided by a quadruple Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launcher on the hangar roof and two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

As built, &quot;Sirius&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long-range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short-range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried over the ship&#x27;s bridge to direct the 4.5-inch guns, while a GWS22 director for Seacat was mounted on the hangar roof. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 or Type 182 search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar. While she had a well for a Type 199 Variable depth sonar (VDS), this was never fitted, and the well was soon plated over.

==Operational history==
Following commissioning, &quot;Sirius&quot; joined the 24th Escort Squadron, and took part in that year&#x27;s Portsmouth Navy Day. On 28 November 1966, &quot;Sirius&quot; set out from Portsmouth for the Far East, in order to join the Singapore-based 2nd Destroyer Squadron. Early in 1967, she interrupted her passage out to Singapore to carry out a deployment on the Beira Patrol, which was designed to prevent oil reaching landlocked Rhodesia via the then Portuguese colony of Mozambique. After &quot;Sirius&quot; reached her station at Singapore, the frigate took part in a number of &#x27;fly-the-flag&#x27; visits to a variety of ports. &quot;Sirius&quot; also took part in the Coronation of Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou IV of Tonga. The following year, &quot;Sirius&quot; deployed to the West Indies. In 1968 she took part in Portsmouth &#x27;Navy Days&#x27;. Between 1966 and 1968 she was commanded by Derek Reffell.

In April 1970, &quot;Sirius&quot; again deployed to the West Indies, where she would perform the role of guard ship in that region, relieving . On 1 August 1970, the ferry &quot;Chistena&quot; sank off St. Kitts, killing 233 people. &quot;Sirius&quot; took part in rescue operations, recovering bodies from the sea. Only 91 people survived the ferry sinking. For the actions of her crew, &quot;Sirius&quot; was awarded the Wilkinson Sword of Peace. The West Indies Guardship deployment was eventually replaced by the Atlantic Patrol Task. In 1973, &quot;Sirius&quot; became guard ship to the West Indies once more, performing a variety of duties while there, including counter-drug operations. Later in the same year she appeared in an official government documentary during AAW and ASW exercises, along with RAS with RFA Grey Rover (A269) and a port visit to Madeira.
In 1974, &quot;Sirius&quot; joined Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), a multi-national squadron of NATO, taking part in naval exercises in the process and visiting a variety of ports, and one of many deployments with NATO&#x27;s multi-national squadrons. In 1975, &quot;Sirius&quot; began her modernisation which included the removal of her single 4.5-in twin gun in favour of the Exocet anti-ship missile system, as well as the amount of Sea Cat missiles she carried, increased. The modernisation was completed in October 1977. In 1978, &quot;Sirius&quot; became the leader of the 6th Frigate Squadron.

In September 1982, &quot;Sirius&quot; deployed to the Falkland Islands to perform a Falkland Islands patrol in the tense aftermath of the Falklands War. The following year, &quot;Sirius&quot; received the towed array sensor. In 1988, &quot;Sirius&quot;, as part of the group deployment Exercise &#x27;Outback 88&#x27;, deployed to the Far East and Pacific, attended Exercise Starfish with New Zealand, Australian, Malaysian and Singaporean naval units, and visited Australia for the 1988 bicentennial naval Salute, visiting a variety of ports in the process.

&quot;Sirius&quot; was paid off on 17 February 1992 and was stricken on 28 February 1993. She was subsequently towed to Pembroke Dockyard in preparation for her to be sunk as a target. However, her sinking was delayed by environmentalist groups. In 1998, &quot;Sirius&quot; was finally sunk as a target in the Atlantic Ocean by the submarine and the Type 23 frigate, . Her sinking left just one &quot;Leander&quot;, , afloat in the United Kingdom; &quot;Scylla&quot; was later sunk as an artificial reef on 27 March 2004.

<text>The Lockheed Hudson is a light bomber and coastal reconnaissance aircraft built by the American Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. It was initially put into service by the Royal Air Force shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War and primarily operated by it thereafter. The Hudson was a military conversion of the Model 14 Super Electra airliner, and was the first significant aircraft construction contract for Lockheed — the initial RAF order for 200 Hudsons far surpassed any previous order the company had received. 

The Hudson served throughout the war, mainly with Coastal Command but also in transport and training roles, as well as delivering agents into occupied France. It was also used extensively with the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s anti-submarine squadrons and by the Royal Australian Air Force.

==Design and development==
In late 1937 Lockheed sent a cutaway drawing of the Model 14 to various publications, showing the new aircraft as a civilian aircraft and converted to a light bomber. This attracted the interest of various air forces and in 1938, the British Purchasing Commission sought an American maritime patrol aircraft for the United Kingdom to support the Avro Anson.

The Commission ordered 200 aircraft for use by the Royal Air Force and the first aircraft started flight trials from Burbank, California on 10 December 1938. The flight trials showed no major issues, and deliveries to the RAF began on 15 February 1939. Production was sped up after the British indicated they would order another 50 aircraft if the original 200 could be delivered before the end of 1939. Lockheed sub-contracted some parts assembly to Rohr Aircraft Corp of San Diego and increased its workforce, allowing the company to produce the 250th aircraft seven and a half weeks before the deadline.

A total of 350 Mk I and 20 Mk II Hudsons were supplied (the Mk II had different propellers). These had two fixed Browning machine guns in the nose and two more in the Boulton Paul dorsal turret. The Hudson Mk III added one ventral and two beam machine guns and replaced the 1,100 hp Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9-cylinder radials with 1,200 hp versions (428 produced).

The Hudson Mk V (309 produced) and Mk VI (450 produced) were powered by the 1,200 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp 14-cylinder two-row radial. The RAF also obtained 380 Mk IIIA and 30 Mk IV Hudsons under the Lend-Lease program.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
By February 1939, RAF Hudsons began to be delivered, initially equipping No. 224 Squadron RAF at RAF Leuchars, Scotland in May 1939. By the start of the war in September, 78 Hudsons were in service. Due to the United States&#x27; neutrality at that time, early series aircraft were flown to the Canada–US border, landed, and then towed on their wheels over the border into Canada by tractors or horse drawn teams, before then being flown to Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) airfields where they were then dismantled and &quot;cocooned&quot; for transport as deck cargo, by ship to Liverpool. The Hudsons were supplied without the Boulton Paul dorsal turret, which was installed on arrival in the United Kingdom.

Although later outclassed by larger bombers, the Hudson achieved some significant feats during the first half of the war. On 8 October 1939, over Jutland, a Hudson became the first Allied aircraft operating from the British Isles to shoot down an enemy aircraft (earlier victories by a Fairey Battle on 20 September 1939 over Aachen and by Blackburn Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm on 26 September 1939 had been by aircraft based in France or on an aircraft carrier). Hudsons also provided top cover during the Battle of Dunkirk. On 23 July 1941 a Hudson shot down a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor, while escorting a shipping convoy off Ireland.

On 27 August 1941, a Hudson of No. 269 Squadron RAF, operating from Kaldadarnes, Iceland, attacked and damaged the causing the submarine&#x27;s crew to display a white flag and surrender – the aircraft achieved the unusual distinction of capturing a naval vessel. The Germans were taken prisoner and the submarine taken under tow when Royal Navy ships subsequently arrived on the scene. A PBO-1 Hudson of the United States Navy squadron VP-82 became the first US aircraft to destroy a German submarine, when it sank southwest of Newfoundland on 1 March 1942. was destroyed on 7 July 1942 while running on the surface off Cape Hatteras by a Hudson of the 396th Bombardment Squadron (Medium), United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). A Hudson of No. 113 Squadron RCAF became the first aircraft of the RCAF&#x27;s Eastern Air Command to sink a submarine, when Hudson &quot;625&quot; sank on 31 July 1942.

A Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Hudson was involved in the Canberra air disaster of 1940, in which three ministers of the Australian government were killed.

On 10 August 1942 RAAF 13 squadron sank IJN auxiliary netlayer Fukuei Maru No. 15 off Beco, Portuguese Timor.

In 1941, the USAAF began operating the Hudson; the Twin Wasp-powered variant was designated the A-28 (82 acquired) and the Cyclone-powered variant was designated the A-29 (418 acquired). The US Navy operated 20 A-29s, redesignated the PBO-1. A further 300 were built as aircrew trainers, designated the AT-18.
Following Japanese landings at Kota Bharu during the Malayan campaign, Hudsons from No. 1 Squadron RAAF became the first Allied aircraft to make an attack in the Pacific War, sinking a Japanese transport ship, the &quot;Awazisan Maru&quot;, off Kota Bharu at 0118h local time, an hour before the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Its opponents found that the Hudson had exceptional manoeuvrability for a twin-engine aircraft; it was notable for the tight turns achievable if either engine was briefly feathered. 
High-scoring Japanese ace Saburō Sakai, praised the skill and fighting abilities of an RAAF Hudson crew killed in action over New Guinea after being engaged by nine highly manoeuvrable Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes on 22 July 1942. The crew, captained by P/O Warren Cowan, in Hudson Mk IIIA &quot;A16-201&quot; (bu. no. &quot;41-36979&quot;) of No. 32 Squadron RAAF, was intercepted over Buna by nine Zeroes of the &quot;Tainan Kaigun Kōkūtai&quot; led by Sakai. The Hudson crew accomplished many aggressive and unexpected turns, engaging the Japanese pilots in a dogfight for more than 10 minutes. It was only after Sakai scored hits on the rear/upper turret that the Hudson could be destroyed. Its crew made such an impression on Sakai that, after the war&#x27;s end, he sought to identify them. In 1997, Sakai wrote formally to the Australian government, recommending that Cowan be &quot;posthumously awarded your country&#x27;s highest military decoration&quot;.

On 23 November 1942, the crew of a No. 3 Squadron, Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Hudson Mk IIIA, &quot;NZ2049&quot;, (&quot;41-46465&quot;) after spotting an enemy convoy near Vella Lavella, was engaged by three Japanese floatplane fighters. After skilled evasive manoeuvring at an altitude of less than 50 feet (15 metres), by the Hudson&#x27;s captain, Flying Officer George Gudsell, the crew returned with no casualties to Henderson Field, Guadalcanal.

Hudsons were also operated by RAF Special Duties squadrons for clandestine operations; No. 161 Squadron in Europe and No. 357 Squadron in Burma.

===Postwar use===

After the war, numbers of Hudsons were sold by the military for civil operation as airliners and survey aircraft. In Australia, East-West Airlines of Tamworth, New South Wales (NSW), operated four Hudsons on scheduled services from Tamworth to many towns in NSW and Queensland between 1950 and 1955. Adastra Aerial Surveys based at Sydney&#x27;s Mascot Airport operated seven L-414s between 1950 and 1972 on air taxi, survey and photographic flights.

A total of 2,941 Hudsons were built.

The type formed the basis for development of the Lockheed Ventura resulting in them being withdrawn from front line service from 1944, though many survived the war to be used as civil transports, primarily in Australia and a single example was briefly used as an airline crew trainer in New Zealand.
