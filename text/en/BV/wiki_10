<text>The homestead principle is the principle by which one gains ownership of an unowned natural resource by performing an act of original appropriation. Appropriation could be enacted by putting an unowned resource to active use (as with using it to produce some product),
joining it with previously acquired property, or by marking it as owned (as with livestock branding).

Homesteading is one of the foundations of Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism and right-libertarianism.

== In political philosophy ==

=== Mohammad ===
In Islam, a &quot;dead&quot; land (not previously owned or under use by the public) can be owned by &quot;reviving&quot; it, as per the prophetic saying: &quot;If anyone revives dead land, it belongs to him, and the unjust root has no right.&quot;

This principle, however, does not deprive the community from some common rights in the land, including the right to pass water through it to the neighbor&#x27;s land, for example.

=== John Locke ===

In his 1690 work &quot;Second Treatise of Government&quot;, Enlightenment philosopher John Locke advocated the Lockean proviso which allows for homesteading.

Locke famously saw the mixing of labour with land as the source of ownership via homesteading:
:Though the earth and all inferior creatures be common to all men, yet every man has a &quot;property&quot; in his own &quot;person&quot;. This nobody has any right to but himself. The &quot;labour&quot; of his body and the &quot;work&quot; of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever, then, he removes out of the state that Nature hath provided and left it in, he hath mixed his &quot;labour&quot; with it, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his &quot;property&quot;.

Furthermore, Locke held that individuals have a right to homestead private property from nature only so long as &quot;there is enough, and as good, left in common for others&quot;. The Lockean proviso maintains that appropriation of unowned resources is a diminution of the rights of others to it, and would only be acceptable if it does not make anyone else worse-off.

=== Pope Pius XI ===
In his encyclical &quot;Quadragesimo Anno&quot;, Pope Pius XI affirmed homesteading as the source of ownership:That ownership is originally acquired both by occupancy of a thing not owned by any one and by labor, or, as is said, by specification, the tradition of all ages as well as the teaching of Our Predecessor Leo clearly testifies. For, whatever some idly say to the contrary, no injury is done to any person when a thing is occupied that is available to all but belongs to no one; however, only that labor which a man performs in his own name and by virtue of which a new form or increase has been given to a thing grants him title to these fruits (Paragraph 52).

=== Murray Rothbard ===

Libertarian philosopher and Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard argued that homesteading includes all the rights needed to engage in the homesteading action, including nuisance and pollution rights. He writes:
:Most of us think of homesteading unused resources in the old-fashioned sense of clearing a piece of unowned land and farming the soil. ... Suppose, for example, that an airport is established with a great deal of empty land around it. The airport exudes a noise level of, say, decibels, with the sound waves traveling over the empty land. A housing development then buys land near the airport. Some time later, the homeowners sue the airport for excessive noise interfering with the use and quiet enjoyment of the houses.

:Excessive noise can be considered a form of aggression but in this case the airport has already homesteaded decibels worth of noise. By its prior claim, the airport now &quot;owns the right&quot; to emit decibels of noise in the surrounding area. In legal terms, we can then say that the airport, through homesteading, has earned an easement right to creating decibels of noise. This homesteaded easement is an example of the ancient legal concept of &quot;prescription&quot;, in which a certain activity earns a prescriptive property right to the person engaging in the action.

Rothbard interpreted the physical extent to which a homesteading act establishes ownership in terms of the relevant &quot;technological unit&quot;, which is the minimal amount necessary for the practical use of the resource. He writes:
=== Anthony de Jasay ===
Hungarian political philosopher Anthony de Jasay argued that a homesteader, having a claim prior to any other, must be prima facie considered the owner of the resource, in accordance with the principle &quot;let ownership stand&quot;:

:[If] taking first possession of a thing is a feasible act of his that is admissible if it is not a tort (in this case not trespass) and violates no right; but this is the case by definition, i.e., by the thing being identified as &quot;unowned&quot;. Taking exclusive possession of it is, in terms of our classification of possible acts, a liberty, and as such only a contrary right can obstruct or oppose it.

: 14   The opponent of this simple thesis is trying to have it both ways: He is both asserting that the thing has no legitimate first owner from whom a second or nth owner could have legitimately obtained it by agreed transfer, and that there is nevertheless somebody who has been and still is entitled to use the thing and therefore can validly object to being excluded from it. But an entitlement to use the thing is an at least partial antecedent ownership claim needing an owner, or the permission of an owner, before it can be made; ownership cannot both exist yet not exist.

: If, on the other hand, the objectors have been using the thing without being entitled to it, because no third party had excluded them by taking first possession, and because they were unable, unwilling, or uninterested to perform the act of taking first possession themselves (whatever that act may consist of), their enjoyment of the thing was precarious, not vested. Its appropriation by a third party may have deprived them of an uncovenanted advantage, but it did not violate their rights.

=== Hans-Hermann Hoppe ===

Similarly to de-Jasay, Hans-Hermann Hoppe argues that the denial of the homesteading rule entails a performative contradiction. That is because honest argumentation must presuppose an intersubjectively ascertainable (i.e. justifiable) norm, and all norms not relying on the original establishment of a physical (and therefore evident) link to the owner are subjective in nature, and therefore contradict the presuppositions of argumentation. He writes:
: Further, if one were not allowed to appropriate other resources through homesteading action, i.e., by putting them to use before anybody else does, or if the range of objects to be homesteaded were somehow limited, this would only be possible if ownership could be acquired by mere decree instead of by action. However, this does not qualify as a solution to the problem of ethics, i.e., of conflict-avoidance, even on purely technical grounds, for it would not allow one to decide what to do if such declarative claims happened to be incompatible.

: More decisive still, it would be incompatible with the already justified self-ownership, for if one could appropriate resources by decree, this would imply that one could also declare another person&#x27;s body to be one&#x27;s own. Thus, anyone denying the validity of the homesteading principle – whose recognition is already implicit in arguing two persons&#x27; mutual respect for each other&#x27;s exclusive control over his own body – would contradict the content of his proposition through his very act of proposition making.

=== Ayn Rand ===
Ayn Rand did not elaborate on the characteristics of homesteading, but she expressed support for compatible laws such as favourably citing the &quot;Homestead Act&quot; (1862):
:A notable example of the proper method of establishing private ownership from scratch, in a previously ownerless area, is the Homestead Act of 1862, by which the government opened the Western frontier for settlement and turned &quot;public land&quot; over to private owners. The government offered a 160 acre farm to any adult citizen who would settle on it and cultivate it for five years, after which it would become his property.

:Although that land was originally regarded, in law, as &quot;public property&quot;, the method of its allocation, in fact, followed the proper principle (&quot;in fact&quot;, but not in explicit ideological &quot;intention&quot;). The citizens did not have to pay the government as if it were an owner; ownership began with them, and they earned it by the method which is the source and root of the concept of &quot;property&quot;: By working on unused material resources, by turning a wilderness into a civilized settlement. Thus, the government, in this case, was acting not as the owner but as the custodian of ownerless resources who defines objectively impartial rules by which potential owners may acquire them.

=== Linda and Morris Tannehill ===
Linda and Morris Tannehill argued in their 1970 book &quot;The Market for Liberty&quot; that physically claiming the land (e.g. by fencing it in or prominently staking it out) should be enough to obtain good title:
:An old and much-respected theory holds that for a man to come into possession of a previously unowned value it is necessary for to mix his labor with the land to make it his own. But this theory runs into difficulties when one attempts to explain what is meant by &#x27;mixing labor with land&#x27;. Just how much labor is required, and of what sort? If a digs a large hole in his land and then fills it up again, can he be said to have mixed his labor with the land? Or is it necessary to effect a somewhat permanent change in the land?

: If so, how permanent? ... Or is it necessary to effect some improvement in the economic value of the land? If so, how much and how soon? ... Would a man lose title to his land if he had to wait ten months for a railroad line to be built before he could improve the land? ... And what of the naturalist who wanted to keep his land exactly as it was in its wild state to study its ecology? ... [M]ixing one&#x27;s labor with the land is too ill-defined a concept and too arbitrary a requirement to serve as a &quot;criterion&quot; of ownership.

== In law ==
There are two different legal systems from which land ownership, and its scope, derive: Common law and statute law. A frequent issue of contention in both cases is the ownership of resources passing across property, such as streams or rivers, to which others downstream may assert property / water rights, and underground resources, such as subterranean water and minerals.

For limits to ownership &quot;above&quot; land, an old principle in the law is &quot;ad coelum&quot;, meaning that property rights extend &quot;to the sky&quot; (and below the earth). In the past, rights to &quot;the sky&quot; have been unenforcable – birds need take little notice of humans&#x27; overhead property rights – but with modern technology extending human reach, the idea of &quot;ad coelum&quot; rights may change.

=== Common law ===

Common law provides the &quot;ad coelum&quot; (&quot;to the sky&quot;) doctrine by which landowners own everything below and above the land, up to the sky and below the earth to its core, with the exception of volatile minerals such as natural gas. The rules governing what constitutes homesteading were not specified by common law but by the local statutory law. Common law also recognizes the concept of adverse possession (&quot;squatters&#x27; rights&quot;). Murray Rothbard criticized this doctrine as incompatible with his own homestead principle as a literal application prevent aircraft from traveling over someone&#x27;s land, further arguing:
:But is the practical problem of aviation the only thing wrong with the ad coelum rule? Using the homesteading principle, the ad coelum rule never made any sense, and is therefore overdue in the dustbin of legal history. If one homesteads and uses the soil, in what sense is he also using all the sky above him up into heaven? Clearly, he isn&#x27;t.

So long as the aircraft did not damage or disturb the land, the owner would not have a claim. By the same principle, ownership of mineral and water resources on or under the land would also require homesteading, otherwise being left unowned.

=== Statutory law ===
In the 19th century, a number of governments formalized the homestead principle by passing laws that would grant property of land plots of certain standardized size to people who would settle on it and &quot;improve&quot; it in certain ways (typically, built their residence and started to farm at least a certain fraction of the land). Typically, such laws would apply to territories recently taken from their indigenous inhabitants, and which the state would want to have populated by farmers. Examples include:
* New South Wales: Crown Lands Acts (1861)
* Canada: &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; (1872)
* United States: Florida Armed Occupation Act (1842), Homestead Act (1862)

<doc id="612364" wikidata="Q6688396" url="?curid=612364" title="Louis Wolfson">
<text>Louis Elwood Wolfson (January 28, 1912 – December 30, 2007) was an American financier, a convicted felon, and one of the first modern corporate raiders, labeled by &quot;Time&quot; as such in a 1956 article. A self-made millionaire by 28, Wolfson is credited with creating the modern hostile tender offer, which laid the technical framework to the leveraged buyout. In later years, he was a major thoroughbred horse racing participant as the owner and breeder of 1978 American Triple Crown winner, Affirmed.

Wolfson was frequently in trouble with the law. In 1957, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ordered a ten-day suspension of trading in stock in a company Wolfson held &quot;to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices&quot;. In 1967, he was convicted of selling unregistered shares and obstruction of justice, for which he served nine months in a federal prison. The conviction eventually led to a scandal involving Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, who resigned in 1969 after returning a $20,000 retainer to a Wolfson foundation. In 1971, Wolfson was involved in a contentious legal battle with radio host Larry King over monies Wolfson supplied and King allegedly pocketed. Later King claimed Wolfson paid him $48,500 to influence President Richard Nixon&#x27;s incoming U.S. Attorney General, John N. Mitchell, into reviewing Wolfson&#x27;s past conviction.

==Early life==
Wolfson was born in St. Louis, Missouri, but his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, when he was one year old.

The child of Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, Wolfson and his seven siblings grew up in Jacksonville, where his father was a junk man/scrap metal dealer.
In his teens, he boxed professionally under the name &quot;Kid Wolf&quot;, earning from $25 to $100 per fight. Wolfson was an outstanding athlete and an All-Southern end for Jacksonville&#x27;s Andrew Jackson High School, who went to the University of Georgia to play football. He left the university after two years, never graduating.

After dropping out of college, he raised $10,000 to start in business: half from a wealthy Georgia football fan, Harold Hirsch, and half from his family.

==Financier==
He started the Florida Pipe and Supply Company to trade in building materials. Within a few years, he built this into a successful large business and was a millionaire at age 28.

In 1949, Wolfson purchased the Capital Transit Company from the North American Company for $2 million. Capital Transit held the streetcar and bus service franchise for Washington, D.C.; it had been managed conservatively and beyond its physical assets had a $7 million cash reserve. When the company disbursed $3 million in dividends to shareholders, the government revoked Capital Transit&#x27;s right to operate, and Wolfson sold his shares for $13.5 million.

A 1951 takeover of Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott made Wolfson Chairman and CEO of the marine construction and salvage firm, but Wolfson expanded the company into shipbuilding, chemicals, and money lending, becoming one of the first conglomerates. The corporation won numerous multimillion-dollar contracts for high-profile projects, including the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona, the United States Navy supercarrier Kitty Hawk and the Mackinac Bridge that linked Michigan&#x27;s lower and upper peninsulas. Wolfson became nationally known in 1955, when he unsuccessfully attempted a hostile takeover of Montgomery Ward and Co.

His Universal Marion Co. owned the &quot;Miami Beach Sun&quot; and the &quot;Jacksonville Chronicle&quot; newspapers and made movies through a subsidiary. The firm co-financed the production of Mel Brooks&#x27; first movie, &quot;The Producers&quot;, which won an Oscar and later became a major Broadway play. The building now known as the JEA Tower in Jacksonville was called the Universal-Marion Building when the firm was the largest tenant.
At its peak, his industrial and commercial empire had total assets estimated at a quarter of a billion dollars.

==Philanthropy==
As chairman of the Wolfson Family Foundation for 35 years until the late 1980s, Wolfson directed much of the foundation&#x27;s gifts to Jacksonville, Florida&#x27;s medical, educational, research and religious charitable entities. Louis&#x27;s father, Morris David Wolfson, began the philanthropy with a gift of $500,000 in 1946 to create Wolfson Children&#x27;s Hospital. Other gifts included the &quot;Wolfson Student Center&quot; at Jacksonville University, the &quot;River Garden/Wolfson Health and Aging Center&quot; and the &quot;Louis E. Wolfson Wellness Center&quot; at Baptist Medical Center Downtown.

Louis Wolfson worked to honor the memory of his older brother, Sam. The Duval County School Board named Samuel W. Wolfson High School after his brother and the Wolfson family funded construction of Sam W. Wolfson Baseball Park, the minor-league baseball facility in Jacksonville for decades until the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville was built in 2002-3.

==Legal and political controversies==
In November 1957, Louis Wolfson sold a trailer company controlled by one of his interests to Detroit&#x27;s Trans Continental Industries. His longtime friend, David Charnay, was chairman prior to Charnay&#x27;s purchase and global modernization of Four Star International. The trailer company became Trans Continental&#x27;s chief asset. Upon reviewing the sale from Louis Wolfson to David Charnay, the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered a ten-day suspension of trading in Trans Continental stock on the American and Detroit stock exchanges, based upon a conjectured and speculative reason: &quot;To prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices&quot;.

Wolfson started a charitable foundation, which in 1966 paid Supreme Court Justice and Wolfson friend Abe Fortas a $20,000 lifetime annual retainer for unspecified consultation. Researchers suspect this sum may have represented an attempted bribery to secure Fortas&#x27;s assistance with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wolfson had appealed his conviction all the way to the Supreme Court. Although the Supreme Court had refused to review his conviction and Fortas did not participate in that decision, it was viewed as an attempt to buy his way out of a conviction. Controversy surrounded Fortas and he returned the $20,000 retainer and ultimately resigned from the Supreme Court in 1969.

In 1967, Wolfson was convicted on charges stemming from stock sales. The conviction arose when Wolfson sold unregistered shares in Continental Enterprises, Inc. to the public. Wolfson controlled Continental Enterprises, an unlisted company which was a Florida-based real-estate and movie theater business with numerous other holdings. He never denied the charges but argued that the law was misapplied in his case. The second conviction was for charges of perjury and obstruction of justice during a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Merritt-Chapman. He served nine months at the Federal Bureau of Prisons Federal Prison Camp, Eglin, Eglin Air Force Base. He also paid a substantial fine.

In 1971, Wolfson filed a complaint against Larry King—then a Miami radio host, later a CNN personality—for allegedly pocketing $5,000, part of a $25,000 payment destined for New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who was investigating President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. King was arrested for grand larceny, but the original criminal charges were dismissed as the statute of limitations had elapsed. While a judge subsequently threw out the charge, King pled no contest to one count of passing bad checks. King was fired from WIOD after Wolfson wrote to TV and radio executives at WTVJ and WIOD claiming that King was &quot;a menace to the public&quot; and that his employers should pay for King&#x27;s &quot;treatment in a mental institution for six months so he can do no further harm in this community or any other.&quot;

==Criminal justice activism==
After his incarceration, Wolfson became a prison reform advocate. He told &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; in 1971 that he had watched sadistic wardens and guards &quot;contribute to the increase of crime. ...The medical attention was unbelievably bad. There was absolutely no uniform sentencing. ...Officials may say rehabilitation exists, but I assure you it doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

As a result of his efforts, the SEC began making hearing transcripts and testimony more available, and the U.S. Senate considered changing federal penal code to eliminate harsh sentences for first-time offenders.

&quot;It was a horrible 10 months and it ruined his life and changed him forever&quot;, his son said. &quot;If you ever said the word &quot;judge&quot;, he&#x27;d bring out a stack of papers to prove how he was falsely charged for ulterior political motives.&quot;
==Harbor View Farm and thoroughbred racing==
In 1960, he established Harbor View Farm in Fellowship, Marion County, Florida. He raced a number of successful thoroughbred horses including 1963 co-champion 2-year-old male Raise a Native, and 1965 Horse of the Year, Roman Brother.

Champion Hail to Reason, bred by Bieber-Jacobs Stable had raced in the name of Patrice Jacobs, his second wife. Together, in the name of Harbor View, they bred and raced the 1978 American Triple Crown winner Affirmed. Affirmed was voted Horse of the Year twice, in 1978 and 1979, and also was champion at 2 in 1977, at 3 in 1978, and at 4 in 1979.
The Wolfsons&#x27; stable led all North American owners in money earned in 1978, 1979, and 1980 and was the Eclipse Award winners as top breeder in 1978.

Additionally, two of Wolfson sons, Steve and Gary, bred It&#x27;s In The Air, American Co-Champion Two-Year-Old Filly in 1978, in the name of Happy Valley Farm.

Wolfson tried to buy Louisville&#x27;s Churchill Downs—home of the Kentucky Derby—for $46.1 million in 1985, but was unsuccessful.

In 1992, Louis Wolfson was inducted into the Horsemen&#x27;s Benevolent and Protective Association Hall of Fame.
His second and final marriage was to Patrice Jacobs, daughter of Hall of Fame trainer Hirsch Jacobs and Ethel D. Jacobs.

==Personal life==
Wolfson married twice. His first wife, Florence Monsky, died in 1968 from cancer. His second wife was Patrice Jacobs, to whom he remained married until his death. At the age of 95, Wolfson succumbed to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and colon cancer, dying on December 30, 2007, his 35th wedding anniversary, in Bal Harbour, Florida. He had four children, including son Marty.

<text>The Union progressiver Juden in Deutschland (UPJ; &quot;Union of Progressive Jews in Germany&quot;) is a &quot;Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts&quot;, a publicly chartered association, founded in 1997 as the congregational arm of Liberal (also Progressive or Reform) Judaism in Germany. It is headed by Irith Michelsohn and has around 5,200 members. It is an affiliate of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. Rabbi Walter Homolka was former President and was also the most senior rabbinic figure associated with the UPJ, and the Abraham-Geiger-Kolleg serves as rabbinical seminary since 1999.

Liberal – known internationally also as Reform or Progressive – Judaism has a long history in Germany. Abraham Geiger, Samuel Holdheim and the other great Reform rabbis considered founders of the movement led it in the mid-19th century. After the 1844-46 synods, the term &quot;Liberal&quot; substituted the formerly common &quot;Reform&quot; to denote the relative moderation maintained in communities which remained unified. Only the semi-independent, splinter Reform Congregation in Berlin followed a radical line. The Liberals did not formally consolidate as a denomination, but were rather a tendency within communal frameworks. Their focal point was the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums, their seminary. In 1898, Rabbi Heinemann Vogelstein was determined to counter conservative elements and formed a Liberal rabbinical association, Union of Liberal Rabbis. In 1908 a congregational arm followed, the Union for Liberal Judaism in Germany. These were founding members of the WUPJ in 1926. After World War II, the movement slowly recovered.

The publication work of the union began in 1997 with Seder ha-Tefillot, the Jewish prayer book by Jonathan Magonet in cooperation with Walter Homolka, translated from the Hebrew by Annette M. Böckler. In 1998 a Passover Haggadah was published. From 1999 to 2004 Annette M. Böckler translated W. Gunther Plaut&#x27;s commentary on the Torah into German.

The Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland) rejected the association and insisted on a single representative voice for Jewish organisations. In particular this concerned the contract with the government, signed with the Central Council on 27 January 2003, and its associated aid money.

In April 2004 open hostility broke out between the president of the Central Council, Paul Spiegel, and then chairman of the UPJ, Jan Mühlstein. Mühlstein called for financial equality between the Liberal Jewish organisations regarding the distribution of 3 million Euros of state funding annually, set by a contract with the government. On 20 November 2005 two Jewish State Associations with numerous congregations of the Union were absorbed into the Central Council, after the status of a corporate body of public rights was conferred to them. The Union is currently participating in the state funding through the Central Council.

== Tourist ==
Burning grass hill (Đồi cỏ cháy): The road to the Ba Quang burnt grass hill area is quite convenient. The distance from Thanh Nhat town (Ha Lang) to the hill area is about 6-7 km of concrete road, which can be traveled by motorbike or car. Tourists should note that when you reach the intersection of Khum Din hamlet, 3 km from Vinh Quy commune People&#x27;s Committee, turn right onto the small concrete road and continue for about 3 km to reach Ba Quang grass hill. The road here is considered relatively dangerous and difficult to travel, so visitors should choose to travel by motorbike, especially a manual transmission or high-clearance car.

<doc id="612367" wikidata="Q1552748" url="?curid=612367" title="Pulmonary valve">
<text>The pulmonary valve (sometimes referred to as the pulmonic valve) is a valve of the heart that lies between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, and has three cusps. It is one of the four valves of the heart and one of the two semilunar valves, the other being the aortic valve. Similar to the aortic valve, the pulmonary valve opens in ventricular systole when the pressure in the right ventricle rises above the pressure in the pulmonary artery. At the end of ventricular systole, when the pressure in the right ventricle falls rapidly, the pressure in the pulmonary artery closes the pulmonary valve.

The closure of the pulmonary valve contributes to the P2 component of the second heart sound (S2).

==Structure==
The pulmonary orifice lies nearly in the horizontal plane, and is situated at a superior level than the aortic orifice.

=== Cusps ===
At the apex of the infundibulum, the pulmonary orifice is guarded by three semilunar cusps - two anterior and one posterior, with free edges projecting upward into the lumen of pulmonary trunk. The cusps are named according to their positions during foetal development: the anterior, the posterior, and the septal cusp. The free edge of each cusp presents a fibrous nodule of semilunar cusp at the centre with two lateral thin portions, the lunule of semilunar cusp. Each cusp forms pocket like dilatation called pulmonary sinus at the initial portion of pulmonary trunk.

== Clinical significance ==
The right heart is a low-pressure system, so the P2 component of the second heart sound is usually softer than the A2 component of the second heart sound. However, it is physiologically normal in some young people to hear both components separated during inhalation.

<text>Ptolemy XI Alexander II (, &quot;Ptolemaĩos Aléxandros&quot;) was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty who ruled Egypt for a few days in 80 BC. He was a son of Ptolemy X Alexander I and Cleopatra Selene.

==Biography==
Ptolemy XI was born to Ptolemy X Alexander I and supposedly Cleopatra Selene.
His uncle Ptolemy IX Lathryos died in 81 BC or 80 BC, leaving only his sole legitimate daughter as his heir, and so Cleopatra Berenice (= Berenice III) ruled alone for a time. Rome&#x27;s Sulla wanted a pro-Roman ruler on the throne, and sent the young son of Ptolemy X to Egypt, displaying Ptolemy Alexander&#x27;s will in Rome as supposed justification for this obvious interference.

The will also apparently required Ptolemy XI to marry Berenice III, who was his stepmother, cousin, and possible half-sister. 
Nineteen days after the marriage, Ptolemy murdered his bride for unknown reasons, an unwise move since Berenice was very popular. Ptolemy was soon lynched by the citizens of Alexandria.

He was succeeded by his cousin Ptolemy XII, an illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX.

<text>Booneville is an Census Designated Place in Dallas County, Iowa, United States. It is part of the Des Moines–West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Booneville was laid out as a town in 1871 by surveyor A. J. Lyon. The community is named after the William and Susan Boone family, who were prominent local landowners. Early businesses in Booneville included a general store and post office, run by W. H. Baldwin, a drugstore, a hotel, two doctors, a blacksmith, a wagonmaker, and a stock dealer. The Methodist Episcopal Church was the first to hold services in town with a pastor who came from Van Meter.

The population was 62 in 1940. The 2020 census population was 266 residents.

Though once a thriving community, Booneville eventually saw a decline in population with reduced use of the local railroad as well as urban sprawl. The town of Booneville now comprises a restaurant and bar; a Methodist church; the United States Post Office for ZIP code 50038; and a small RV park (part of a mobile home community).

Booneville lies directly northeast of the Raccoon River, and a boat ramp near the town is used frequently.

Although Booneville lies in the annexation path of West Des Moines, situated only a few miles away to the east, West Des Moines officials have stated that there are no plans to annex Booneville in the near future.

<text>Jan Mühlstein (born 3 July 1949) is a journalist, German Jewish activist and the former chair of the Union of Progressive Jews in Germany.

== Life ==
Jan Mühlstein was born on 3 July 1949 in Most, Czechoslovakia. He grew up in a German-speaking Jewish family, which traditionally practised Liberal Judaism. In 1967, he began studying physics at the Charles University in Prague. After the defeat of the reformation movement known as the Prague Spring, in which Mühlstein participated actively, he emigrated to West Germany in 1969. From 1970 onwards, he studied physics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and completed a Ph.D. in theoretical quantum optics in 1977. During the next four years, he worked in the leadership of project energy research of the nuclear energy research facility in Jülich. Since 1982, Mühlstein has been working as a business journalist in Munich and is deputy chief editor of a journal covering the economics of the energy market.

Between 1977 and 1978, Mühlstein was a board member of the West German section of Amnesty International. He is a co-founder of the Liberal Jewish Community Munich &quot;Beth Shalom&quot;, whose chair he was until 2005. He was again elected as chair of Beth Shalom in May 2011. From 1999 until 2011, he was the chair of the Union of Progressive Jews in Germany. Mühlstein is particularly committed to promote religious plurality in Judaism.

Mühlstein is married to Dr. Verena Mühlstein (born 1953), author of a biography about Albert Schweitzer&#x27;s wife, Helene Bresslau, who is also active at Beth Shalom. One of his three daughters works as a rabbi at the West London Synagogue of British Jews.

<doc id="612372" wikidata="Q634415" url="?curid=612372" title="Midget submarine">
<text>A midget submarine is any submarine under 150 tons, typically operated by a crew of one or two but sometimes up to six or nine, with little or no on-board living accommodation. They normally work with mother ships, from which they are launched and recovered and which provide living accommodation for the crew and support staff.

Both military and civilian midget submarines have been built. Military types work with surface ships and other submarines as mother ships. Civilian and non-combatant military types are generally called submersibles and normally work with surface ships. Most early submarines would now be considered midget submarines, such as the United States Navy&#x27;s and the British Royal Navy&#x27;s (both named for the same designer).

==Military submarines==

===Uses===
Midget submarines are best known for harbor penetration, although only two World War II boats, the British X-craft and the unsuccessful Welman submarine, were specifically designed with this in mind. Japan&#x27;s &quot;Ko-hyoteki&quot;-class submarines were originally designed to take part in decisive fleet actions. However, as circumstances changed, they were given the task of harbor penetration. Germany&#x27;s various World War II designs were mostly designed to attack Allied shipping off landing beaches and harbors, although the &quot;Seehund&quot; had a great enough range to attack shipping off the Thames estuary.

Midget submarines have also seen some use in support roles. X-craft were used for reconnaissance, and the &quot;Seehund&quot; was used to carry supplies. A number of modern midget submarines have also been built for submarine rescue.

===Armament===
Midget submarines are commonly armed with torpedoes and mines in the form of, for example, detachable side loads and nose sections. Alternatively they may function as swimmer delivery vehicles to deliver frogmen to the vicinity of their targets, which are then attacked with limpet mines.

==Civilian==
In civilian use, midget submarines are generally called submersibles; commercial submersibles are used in, for example, underwater maintenance, exploration, archaeology, and scientific research. Other commercially available submersibles are marketed as novelty tourist attractions and as specialised tenders for wealthy yacht owners. Also, a growing number of amateur submariners homebuilt submersibles as a hobby.

== Types by nation ==

=== Belgium ===
* FNRS-2 pioneering research submersible

===Colombia===
* S.X.506 a 70-ton 5-man crew midget submarine designed by Italian shipbuilder Cosmos as a development of earlier S.X.404 by the same firm. Displacement is 58/70 t (surfaced/submerged), length is 23 m, beam is 2 m, draft is 4 m, and speed is 8.5/7 kn (surfaced/submerged). At a speed of 7 kn, range is 1200/60 nmi (surfaced/submerged). Payload includes externally attached torpedoes and swimmer delivery vehicles, and up to 8 divers can be carried in addition to the 5-man crew.

=== Finland ===
* MIR for research and submarine rescue

=== France ===
* FNRS-4 second generation research submersible
* Nautile research submersible to depth of 6 kilometers
* SP-350 &quot;Denise&quot; diving saucer

France also acquired a number of German midget submarines at the end of WW2.

=== Germany ===

Most German midget submarines were developed late in World War II in an attempt to stop the Allied invasion of Europe and used later to disrupt its supply lines. As a result, the submarines mostly engaged in open water attacks rather than harbour penetration.
* Biber (324 built by AG Weser of Bremen)
* Delphin (2 built) 2-man 5-ton torpedo with top speed of and submerged radius of at .
* Hai (midget submarine) prototype of improved Marder.

* Marder (~300 built) similar to Neger with breathing apparatus to allow submerged operation.
* Molch Completely electric motor driven WWII (1944–1945) Midget submarine. Total 393 built.
* Schwertwal (Grampus) Designed as super-fast Walter-type midget boat, but the prototype was not complete when scuttled in May 1945.
* Neger (~200 built) 1-man 5-ton torpedo with underslung G7E torpedo. Top speed 20 knots and range of 30 miles at 3 knots.
* Seehund type XXVIIB Most successful midget submarine in the Kriegsmarine. Operational deployment was between January 1945 – April 1945.
* V.80 4-man 76-ton prototype completed in 1940 to test Walther geared turbine propulsion system. Range was at .
* Orca class post-war midget submarine: 13.27 meter x 2.1 meter 5 men midget submarine with maximum depth of 100, maximum underwater speed of 5 kn, maximum range of 150 nmi, maximum endurance of 4 days, and maximum payload of 250 kg. Periscopes includes television camera, HF/HF communication and GPS antenna. There is also an underwater television camera and obstacle avoidance sonar with an effective range of 200 m. The low acoustic and magnetic signature midget sub displaces 28 t, powered by two computerized permanent magnetic electric motors that drive a single shaft low-cavitation and low noise propeller, which is controlled by fly-by-wire control system that is usually adopted for aircraft. The pressure hull is a modular design consisted of four modules that enables easy transportation and maintenance.

===India===
The Indian Navy is planning to acquire two midget submarines at an estimated cost of ₹2000 Crores for use as swimmer delivery vehicles. These submarines will be used for conducting underwater special operations by MARCOS. Both submarines will be constructed by Hindustan Shipyard Limited.

===Indonesia===
The Indonesian Navy has shown some interest in having a new Midget-class submarine, built by local shipyards, for coastal rather than open water patrol. The submarine was designed a number of years ago by a retired Indonesian Navy submariner officer, Colonel (Ret) Ir. R. Dradjat Budiyanto, Msc. The midget experiment project involves the construction of a submarine, designated MIDGET IM X −1, which will weigh about 150 – 250 tonnes, with a tubular frame design 24 – 30 meters long, and four torpedo tubes. The submarines will have minimum of 8 – 10 crew members including officers. They will have a 40 km range non-hull-penetrating optronic mast as the attack periscope, and a 20 km range navigation periscope.

Indonesian defence minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro has backed the project. Construction should commence at the Indonesian PT.PAL INDONESIA shipyard by late 2011, and will take about three or four years to complete.

* &quot;Siluro a Lenta Corsa&quot; (SLC), also known as &quot;Maiale&quot; (pig), a low speed human torpedo. On 3 December 1941, &quot;Sciré&quot; departed La Spezia carrying three Maiale to conduct what became the Raid on Alexandria (1941). At the island of Leros in the Aegean Sea, six Decima Flottiglia MAS crewmen came aboard, including Lieutenant Luigi Durand de la Penne. On December 18 &quot;Sciré&quot; released the manned torpedoes 1.3 miles from Alexandria commercial harbor, and they entered the harbor when the British opened the boom defence to let three of their destroyers pass. After many difficulties, de la Penne and his crewmate Emilio Bianchi successfully attached a limpet mine under , but had to surface as they attempted to leave and were captured. They refused to answer when questioned and were detained in a compartment aboard &quot;Valiant&quot;. Fifteen minutes before the explosion, de la Penne asked to speak to the &quot;Valiant&quot;&#x27;s captain and informed him of the imminent explosion but refused to give other information. He was returned to the compartment and neither he or Bianchi were injured by the detonation of the mine. The other four torpedo-riders were also captured, but their mines sank &quot;Valiant&quot;, the battleship , the Norwegian tanker &quot;Sagona&quot; and badly damaged the destroyer . The two battleships sank in only a few feet of water and were subsequently re-floated. Nevertheless, they were out of action for over a year.

* Type A &quot;Kō-hyōteki&quot;-class midget submarines were used in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the 1942 attack on Sydney Harbour, and the 1942 Allied attack on Diego Suarez Harbor, in which the type 97 torpedo was used operationally. The wreckage of one of the submarines sunk at Pearl Harbor was located by NOAA&#x27;s Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory (HURL) in August 2002. Photographic analysis conducted by the United States Naval Institute in 1999 indicated that one of the five &quot;Ko-hyoteki&quot;-class submarines managed to enter Pearl Harbor, and successfully fired a torpedo into . On 29 May 1942, one of two midget submarines managed to enter the Diego Suarez harbor and fire two torpedoes. One torpedo seriously damaged the battleship , while the second sank the oil tanker &quot;British Loyalty&quot; (6,993 tons).

=== Sweden ===
* Spiggen II class: midget submarine: 6 man crew midget sub displaces 14 t when submerged, with 5 kn speed and endurance of 2 weeks. Length: 11 m, beam: 1.4 m, height: 1.7 m.
* Sea Dagger: midget submarine developed by Kockums: a midget submarine of modular design with length of 16 – 20 m depending on various configurations totaling 4, including training, reconnaissance, diver delivery and small attack versions. All versions are consisted of 3 modules, two of which are identical for all versions, the bow and stern modules. The midsection has 4 modules to choose from, each for a specific mission. All versions lack the sail.
* UVS-1300 Malen: Originally built for navy purposes as sonar target. Midget submarine: 4 man crew midget sub displaces 11 t when submerged, with 5 kn speed and endurance of at least 1 week depending on fuel carried. Length: 10 m, beam: 1.4 m, height: 1.7 m.

=== Turkey ===
The Turkish navy has evaluated two midget submarine designs from German firm ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, Type 200 and Type 300 classes:
* Type 200: Displacement: 200 t surfaced, length: 25 m, beam: 4.2 m, draft 3.1 m, speed: 8 kn surfaced, range: 2100 nmi @ 8 kn surfaced, endurance: 2 weeks, armament: 2 21-in torpedo tubes with a maximum of 4 torpedoes, crew: 6 + 12 divers.
* Type 300: Displacement: 300 t surfaced, length: 30 m, beam: 4.2 m, draft 3.1 m, speed: 12 kn surfaced, range: 3100 nmi @ 8 kn surfaced, endurance: 2 weeks, armament: 2 21-in torpedo tubes with a maximum of 6 torpedoes, crew: 12.

=== United Kingdom ===

The Royal Navy has used a number of midget submarines. Most were developed during the Second World War. The decommissioning of the Stickleback class 1958–early 1960s marked the end of midget submarines designed for combat in the Royal Navy.
* Sleeping Beauty Motorized Submersible Canoe (MSC): developed by Special Operations Executive Station IX during the Second World War.
* Chariot manned torpedo: the British developed two types of manned torpedoes; the Chariot Mark I, of 1.6 ton, and the Chariot Mark II, of 2.3 ton. Sixty-four units were built.
* Stickleback class: a post Second World War development of the XE class.
* X class: used to attack German warships in the north of Norway. One notable target of a successful attack was the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The submarines had a crew of three (plus a diver) and carried two large mines containing Amatol – one on each side. Their strategy was to lay mines on the sea bottom beneath the target, set a time fuse, and leave. 
* XE class: used in the Far East against Japan, where they carried out a number of attacks and special missions.
* Welman submarine: a single-person submersible widely considered a failure.
* Welfreighter: a Station IX-developed special operations submersible with two crew and up to four passengers, designed to resemble a motorboat when surfaced. Over 100 were produced, beginning in September 1944; the extent of operational use is unclear.

=== United States ===

* Advanced SEAL Delivery System: canceled in 2009 due to cost overruns and reliability issues, and the only sub was destroyed in a fire in 2008.
* &quot;Aluminaut&quot;: the first aluminium submarine, used to recover sunken items, including DSV &quot;Alvin&quot; and an unarmed nuclear bomb.
* Bathyscaphe Trieste II (DSV-1): a sister ship to the Swiss-built Bathyscaphe Trieste
* DSV &quot;Alvin&quot; (DSV-2): performed thousands of dives, including one that explored the wreck of the .
* Code name: GIMIK(“&quot;Gizmo #1” and “Gizmo #2&quot;”) Office of Strategic Services Project HEU covert infiltration semi-submersibles for Operation NAPKO during WWII.
* Code name: SKIFF: (#1 and #2): Central Intelligence Agency craft nearly identical in design to GIMIK.
* &quot;Nemo&quot; (DSV-5): an acronym for Naval Experimental Manned Observatory, a test vehicle operated by the Navy from 1970 to 1986. &quot;Nemo&quot; was a spherical submersible with a transparent acrylic hull, and its primary purpose was to evaluate the utility of the panoramic vision enabled by its design. &quot;Nemo&quot; was found to be an effective observation platform, despite not being able to hover in place, and acrylic-hulled submersibles have continued to be built and operated in the US.
* DSRV-1 &quot;Mystic&quot;: a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle formerly operated by the US Navy. &quot;Mystic&quot; was replaced by the Submarine Rescue Diving Recompression System (SRDRS) in 2008 and donated to the Naval Undersea Museum.
* Dry Combat Submersible (DCS): a US Navy submarine under development by Lockheed Martin for transporting Navy SEALs to and from a mission site. It is the planned replacement for the cancelled Advanced SEAL Delivery System.
* USS &quot;X-1&quot;: an experimental US Navy midget submarine of the 1950s, used to explore how to defend harbors against attacks by very small submarines.

===Former Yugoslavia===
* &quot;Una&quot;-class: After the Yugoslav Wars, both Croatia and FR Yugoslavia held examples. Length: 18 m, beam: 3.7 m, diameter: 2.5 m, displacement: 76 t surfaced, 90 t submerged, crew: 4 + 6 divers. Surfaced and submerged speed is 4 kn for both, and the range is 200 nmi surfaced, 50 nmi submerged both @ 4 kn. M-100 lacks sail and its battery can only be charged when surfaced. Up to 4 R-1 swimmer delivery vehicle (SDV)s or two light (400 mm) torpedoes can be carried.
* Type M-100D: Development of Type M-100 Una class. Displacement is increased to around 88/100 t (surfaced/submerged), and the length is increased to approximately 21 m, beam is increased to 4.42 m, and diameter to 2.7 m. Speed is increased to 8/11 kn (surfaced/submerged), and range is increased to 550 nmi surfaced @ 10 kn when surfaced, and that of submerged remains the same as its predecessor M-100 Una class while the payload and crew also remain unchanged. A sail is added, and its battery can be charged while submerged.

<text>Paul Spiegel (31 December 1937, in Warendorf, Germany – 30 April 2006, in Düsseldorf, Germany) was leader of the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland) and the main spokesman of the German Jews. He was widely praised for his leadership of the German Jewish community, which had grown from the remnants left by the Nazis into the third largest Jewish community in western Europe.

==Early life==
Paul Spiegel was born into a Westphalian family of cattle dealers, originating from the small town Versmold. After the Nazi rise to power, the family fled at first to Brussels. Spiegel survived the Holocaust in Flanders where he was hidden by a family of farmers. Prior to that, his sister Rosa had been arrested during a police raid in Brussels; she was later killed in Bergen-Belsen. His father was arrested and held in Buchenwald, Auschwitz, and Dachau, but survived to reunite with Spiegel and his mother in Warendorf after the war. Spiegel described these events in his book &quot;At home again?&quot; (&quot;Wieder zu Hause?&quot;).

Siegel was the nephew of Siegmund, a cattle and horse trader, and Marga Spiegel, both of whom survived the Holocaust with the help of farmers and their families. Marga wrote the memoir &quot;Saviors in the Night&quot;, which was made into a film.

==Journalist==
In 1958, he began practical training as a journalist with the , now the , in Düsseldorf. He was also active as an editor at this newspaper until 1965, when he became editor of the Jewish Press Service and assistant to the secretary-general of the Zentralrat der Juden. During the 1960s he worked for various other newspapers as well.

==Zentralrat der Juden== 
In 1993 he became a member of the executive committee of the Zentralrat der Juden, first as vice president and later (as of 9 January 2000, following the death of Ignatz Bubis) as president. On 11 February 2004, Paul Spiegel received an honorary doctorate from the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, and was made an honorary citizen of Warendorf, the city of his birth. Since 1986 he ran an agency for artists and media in Düsseldorf.

===Equal status for Jewish community in Germany===
On the 58th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in 2003, Spiegel and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder signed an agreement that granted Germany&#x27;s Jewish community the same legal status as the country&#x27;s Christian religions, thereby tripling annual government funding of the Zentralrat der Juden to $3.8 million.

===Outspoken as leader===
Spiegel was an outspoken critic of lawyers who took what he felt were overly large fees to represent Jews who had been slave laborers during World War II, saying &quot;Earning money should not come before moralistic intentions.&quot; He also criticized the national Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, stating at its dedication in 2005 that it failed to address the basic question, &quot;Why were members of a civilized people in the heart of Europe capable of planning and carrying out mass murder?&quot;

==Death==
Paul Spiegel died in the morning hours of 30 April 2006, in Düsseldorf, after suffering from cancer. He is survived by his wife, Gisèle Spatz, whom he married in 1964, and their two daughters.

<text>KOI8-U (RFC 2319) is an 8-bit character encoding, designed to cover Ukrainian, which uses a Cyrillic alphabet. It is based on KOI8-R, which covers Russian and Bulgarian, but replaces eight box drawing characters with four Ukrainian letters Ґ, Є, І, and Ї in both upper case and lower case.

KOI8-RU is closely related, but adds Ў for Belarusian. In both, the letter allocations match those in KOI8-E, except for Ґ which is added to KOI8-F.

In Microsoft Windows, KOI8-U is assigned the code page number 21866. In IBM, KOI8-U is assigned code page/CCSID 1168.

KOI8 remains much more commonly used than ISO 8859-5, which never really caught on. Another common Cyrillic character encoding is Windows-1251. In the future, both may eventually give way to Unicode.

KOI8 stands for &quot;Kod Obmena Informatsiey, 8 bit&quot; () which means &quot;Code for Information Exchange, 8 bit&quot;.

The KOI8 character sets have the property that the Russian Cyrillic letters are in pseudo-Roman order rather than the natural Cyrillic alphabetical order as in ISO 8859-5. Although this may seem unnatural, it has the useful property that if the eighth bit is stripped, the text can still be read (or at least deciphered) in case-reversed transliteration on an ordinary ASCII terminal. For instance, &quot;Код Обмена Информацией&quot; in KOI8-U becomes &quot;kOD oBMENA iNFORMACIEJ&quot; (the Russian meaning of the &quot;KOI&quot; acronym) if the 8th bit is stripped.

==Character set==
The following table shows the KOI8-U encoding. Each character is shown with its equivalent Unicode code point.


Although RFC 2319 says that character 0x95 should be U+2219 (∙), it may also be U+2022 (•) to match the bullet character in Windows-1251.

Some references have a typo and incorrectly state that character 0xB4 is U+0403, rather than the correct U+0404. This typo is present in Appendix A of RFC 2319 (but the table in the main text of the RFC gives the correct mapping).

<text>The satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) is a bowerbird endemic to eastern Australia.

A rare natural intergeneric hybrid between the satin bowerbird and the regent bowerbird is known as Rawnsley&#x27;s bowerbird.

==Description==

Mature males have violet-blue eyes and are uniformly coloured black, however, light diffraction by the surface texture of the feathers results in an almost metallic sheen giving a deep shiny blue appearance. Immature males are coloured and marked the same as females and are often mistaken for them.

Females might be mistaken for the green catbird or spotted catbird with distinctively green/brown or otherwise entirely brown upper body and lighter under body with a distinct reticulated or scalloped pattern, but with very striking blue eyes.

==Distribution==
The satin bowerbird is common in rainforest and tall moist sclerophyll forest in eastern Australia from southern Queensland to Victoria. There is also an isolated population in the Wet Tropics of north Queensland.

==Diet==
Like all Ptilonorhynchidae, satin bowerbirds are predominantly frugivorous as adults, though they also eat leaves and a small amount of seeds and insects. As nestlings, however, they are largely fed on beetles, grasshoppers and cicadas until they can fly.

Satin bowerbirds are not in the least finicky in their food preferences, and have taken extremely readily to the numerous plants introduced since European settlement. Indeed, they are a major dispersal agent for a number of weedy plants, such as camphor laurel, the European olive and various species of privet. They are also often persecuted by horticulturalists because they frequently raid fruit and vegetable crops. Satin bowerbirds are aggressive when foraging, frequently attempting to displace other birds from fruit trees.

==Courtship==
Like all bowerbirds, the satin bowerbird shows highly complex courtship behaviour. Mate choice in satin bowerbirds has been studied in detail. Males build specialised stick structures, called bowers, which they decorate with blue, yellow, and shiny objects, including berries, flowers, snail shells, and plastic items such as ballpoint pens, drinking straws and clothes pegs. As the males mature they use more blue objects than other colours. It is theorized that the preference for blue objects is due to the colour accentuating the plumage of male satin bowerbirds or that the colour blue is more familiar and the designated colour for this species. Females visit these and choose which male they will allow to mate with them. In addition to building their bowers, males carry out intense behavioural displays called dances to woo their mates, but these can be treated as threat displays by the females. Nestbuilding and incubation are carried out by the females alone.

Recent research has shown that female mate choice takes place in three stages:
* Visits to the bowers, before nests have been built, while the males are absent
* Visits to the bowers, before nests have been built, while the males are present and displaying
* Visits to a selection of the bowers, after nests have been built, leading to copulation with (typically) a single male.

Experimental manipulations of the ornaments around the bowers have shown that the choices of young females (those in their first or second year of breeding) are mainly influenced by the appearance of the bowers, and hence by the first stage of this process. Older females, which are less affected by the threatening aspect of the males&#x27; displays, make their choices more on the basis of the males&#x27; dancing displays. It has been hypothesised that as males mature their colour discrimination develops and they are able to select more blue objects for the bower. It is not yet known whether this description would also hold true for other species of bowerbird.

Male satin bowerbirds are known to destroy and steal from the bowers of one another. The quality of a male&#x27;s own bower does not predict how often they will destroy others. However, males who exhibit more aggression by attacking others at feeding sites tend to destroy competitor bowers more frequently.

==Nesting and life cycle==
Satin bowerbirds nest between October and February. Typically two eggs but occasionally one or three are laid in a shallow nest of twigs on top of which are placed leaves of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; or &quot;Acacia&quot;. These leaves turn brown as the eggs are laid, and may serve as camouflage. The eggs are cream but streaked with brown, and are much larger than typical for a bird of its size at around ; they are laid every other day and hatch asynchronously after 21 days of incubation.

The young are able to fly three weeks after hatching, but remain dependent on the female for another two months, finally dispersing at the beginning of the southern winter (May or June).

Female satin bowerbirds mature at two to three years but males do not reach maturity until seven or eight years when they have moulted completely into their characteristic blue-black adult plumage. The satin bowerbird is the longest-lived passerine with anything approaching high-quality banding data: it is estimated that the average lifespan of the species is around eight or nine years, while the record longevity in the wild of twenty-six years is the greatest for any banded passerine.

<doc id="612389" wikidata="Q876616" url="?curid=612389" title="Akula-class submarine">
<text>The Akula&quot; class, Soviet designationProject 971 &quot;Shchuka-B (, NATO reporting name Akula) is a series of fourth generation nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) first deployed by the Soviet Navy in 1986. There are four sub-classes or flights of Shchuka-B, consisting of the original seven Project 971 boats (codenamed &quot;Akula I&quot;), commissioned between 1984 and 1990; six Project 971Is (Improved &quot;Akula&quot;s), commissioned between 1991 and 2009; one Project 971U (&quot;Akula II&quot;), commissioned in 1995; and one Project 971M (&quot;Akula III&quot;), commissioned in 2001. The Russians call all of the submarines &quot;Shchuka-B&quot;, regardless of modifications.

Some confusion may exist as the name &quot;Akula&quot; (Russian: Акула, meaning &quot;shark&quot; in Russian) was used by the Soviets for a different class of submarines, the Project 941, which is known in the West as the . The Project 971 was named &quot;Shchuka-B&quot; by the Soviets but given the designation &quot;Akula&quot; by the West after the name of the lead ship, K-284.

According to defense analyst Norman Polmar, the launch of the first submarine in 1985, &quot;shook everyone [in the West] up&quot;, as Western intelligence agencies had not expected the Soviet Union to produce such a boat for another ten years.

==Design==

The &quot;Akula&quot; incorporates a double hull system composed of an inner pressure hull and an outer &quot;light&quot; hull. This allows more freedom in the design of the exterior hull shape, resulting in a submarine with more reserve buoyancy than its western analogs.

The distinctive &quot;bulb&quot; or &quot;can&quot; located on top of the Akula&#x27;s rudder houses its towed sonar array when retracted. Most &quot;Akulas&quot; have the wake detection system () (SOKS) hydrodynamic sensors, which detect changes in temperature and salinity. They are located on the leading edge of the sail, on the outer hull casing in front of the sail and on the bottom of the hull forward of the sail.

&quot;Akulas&quot; (excluding &quot;Nerpa&quot;) are armed with four 533 mm torpedo tubes which can use Type 53 torpedoes or the RPK-2, RPK-6 missile, and four 650 mm torpedo tubes which can use Type 65 torpedoes or the RPK-7 missile. These torpedo tubes are arranged in two rows of four tubes each. The external tubes are mounted outside the pressure hull in one row, above the torpedo tubes, and can only be reloaded in port or with the assistance of a submarine tender. The 650 mm tubes can be fitted with liners to use the 533 mm weaponry. The submarine is also able to use its torpedo tubes to deploy naval mines. 

==Versions==
As with many Soviet/Russian craft, information on the status of the &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarines is sparse, at best. Information provided by sources varies widely.

===Project 971 (&quot;Akula I&quot;)===

Of the seven original &quot;Akula&quot;s, only three are known to still be in service. These boats are equipped with MGK-540 Skat-3 sonar system (NATO reporting name Shark Gill). The lead boat of the class, K-284 &quot;Akula&quot;, was decommissioned in 2001, apparently to help save money in the cash-strapped Russian Navy. K-322 &quot;Kashalot&quot; and K-480 &quot;Bars&quot; [currently &quot;Ak Bars&quot;] are in reserve. K-480 &quot;Bars&quot; was put into reserve in 1998, and was being dismantled in February 2010. &quot;Pantera&quot; returned to service in January 2008 after a comprehensive overhaul. All were retrofitted with the SOKS hydrodynamic sensors. All submarines before K-391 &quot;Bratsk&quot; have reactor coolant scoops that are similar to the ones of the SSBNs, long and tubular. &quot;Bratsk&quot; and subsequent submarines have reactor coolant scoops similar to the short ones on the Oscar IIs (the &quot;Typhoon&quot;, &quot;Akula&quot; and &quot;Oscar&quot; classes use the similar OK-650 reactor).

===Project 971 and 971I (Improved &quot;Akula I&quot;)===
The six &quot;Akula&quot;s of this class are all thought to be in service. They are quieter than the original &quot;Akula&quot;s. Sources also disagree as to whether construction of this class has been suspended, or if there are a further two units planned.

Improved &quot;Akula I&quot; Hulls: K-328 &quot;Leopard&quot;, K-461 &quot;Volk&quot;, K-154 &quot;Tigr&quot;, K-419 &quot;Kuzbass&quot;, K-295 &quot;Samara&quot; and K-152 &quot;Nerpa&quot;. These submarines are much quieter than early &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarines and all have the SOKS hydrodynamic sensors except &quot;Leopard&quot;.

===Project 971U (&quot;Akula II&quot;)===
K-157 &quot;Vepr&quot; is the only completed &quot;Akula II&quot; (see the table below). The &quot;Akula II&quot; is longer and displaces about 700 tons (submerged displacement) more than the &quot;Akula I&quot;. The added space was used for additional quieting measures. K-157 &quot;Vepr&quot; became the first Russian submarine that was quieter than the latest U.S. attack submarines of that time, which was the improved (SSN 751 and later). Two of these submarines were used to build the SSBNs.

===Project 971M (&quot;Akula III&quot;)===
The K-335 &quot;Gepard&quot; is the 14th submarine of the class and the only completed &quot;Akula III&quot; (see the table below) built for the Russian Navy. It was the first submarine commissioned in the Russian Navy since the &quot;Kursk&quot; disaster, as a result, its commissioning ceremony was an important morale boost for the Russian Navy with President Vladimir Putin in attendance. There is no NATO classification for the &quot;Akula III&quot;. It is longer and has a larger displacement compared to the &quot;Akula II&quot;, also it has an enlarged sail and a different towed-array dispenser on the vertical fin. Again, more noise reduction methods were employed. The &quot;Gepard&quot; was the most advanced Russian submarine before the submarines of the and &quot;Borei&quot; class were commissioned.

The Soviet advances in sound quieting were of considerable concern to the West, for acoustics was long considered the most significant advantage in U.S. submarine technology compared to the Soviets.

In 1983–1984 the Japanese firm Toshiba sold sophisticated, nine axis milling equipment to the Soviets along with the computer control systems, which were developed by Norwegian firm Kongsberg Vaapenfabrik. U.S Navy officials and Congressmen announced that this technology enabled the Soviet submarine builders to produce more accurate and quieter propellers. This is known as the Toshiba–Kongsberg scandal.

Due to the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, production of all &quot;Akula&quot;s slowed.

The 1999–2000 edition of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; incorrectly listed the first &quot;Akula III&quot; as &quot;Viper&quot; (the actual name is &quot;Vepr&quot;, &quot;wild boar&quot; in Russian), commissioned on 25 November 1995. &quot;Gepard&quot; (Cheetah), was launched in 1999 and was commissioned 5 December 2001.

==Operational history==
Between December 1995 and February 1996, submarine &quot;Volk&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean along the Russian aircraft carrier , where she monitored activities of several NATO submarines under Captain 1st rank S. V. Spravtsev.

Between April and June 1996, &quot;Tigr&quot; was deployed in the Atlantic, where she detected a U.S. SSBN and tracked it on its combat patrol. On 23 July 1996, its commander, Captain 1st rank Alexey Burilichev, received a Hero of the Russian Federation award.

In August 2009, the news media reported that two &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarines operated off the East Coast of the United States, with one of the submarines being identified as a Project 971 Shchuka-B type. U.S. military sources noted that this was the first known Russian submarine deployment to the western Atlantic since the end of the Cold War, raising concerns within U.S. military and intelligence communities. U.S. Northern Command confirmed that this 2009 &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarine deployment did occur. One of the boats was likely &quot;Gepard&quot; that finished a relatively lengthy combat patrol between June and September that year under the command of the Captain 1st rank Alexey Vyacheslavovich Dmitrov, who on 15 February 2012 was awarded a title Hero of the Russian Federation for courage shown at work. The other submarine could have been &quot;Tigr&quot; under the command of Captain E. A. Petrov, given that she performed a combat patrol sometime between March and November 2009. It is unlikely that other submarines of the project 971 could have been present in the Atlantic that year. &quot;Pantera&quot; was in Severemorsk during summer, while &quot;Vepr&quot;, &quot;Leopard&quot; and &quot;Volk&quot; did not report any kind of activity in that year (1-3 submarines of the project are usually active with the Northern Fleet at any given moment).

In August 2012, the news media reported that another &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarine operated in the Gulf of Mexico purportedly undetected for over a month, sparking controversy within U.S. military and political circles, with U.S. Senator John Cornyn of the Senate Armed Services Committee demanding details of this deployment from Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, the Chief of Naval Operations. Most likely, this was &quot;Tigr&quot;, as its commander Captain 1st rank Pavel Bulgakov received the Order of Courage on the Defender of the Fatherland Day on 22 February 2013.

==Units==
==&quot;Nerpa&quot; 2008 accident==
On 27 October 2008, it was reported that K-152 &quot;Nerpa&quot; of the Russian Pacific Fleet had begun her sea trials in the Sea of Japan before handover under a lease agreement to the Indian Navy. On 8 November 2008, while conducting one of these trials, an accidental activation of the halon-based fire-extinguishing system took place in the fore section of the vessel. Within seconds the halon gas had displaced all breathable air from the compartment. As a result, 20 people (17 civilians and 3 seamen) were killed by asphyxiation. Dozens of others suffered freon-related injuries and were evacuated to an unknown port in Primorsky Krai. This was the worst accident in the Russian navy since the loss of the submarine K-141 &quot;Kursk&quot; in 2000. The submarine itself did not sustain any serious damage and there was no release of radiation.

==Lease to India==

=== Chakra II ===

Three hundred Indian Navy personnel were trained in Russia for the operation of the Akula II submarine &quot;Nerpa&quot;. India has finalised a deal with Russia, in which at the end of the lease of these submarines, it has an option to buy them. The submarine is named INS &quot;Chakra&quot; as was the previous India-leased Soviet Charlie-I SSGN. &quot;Chakra&quot; was officially commissioned into the Indian Navy on 4 April 2012.

Whereas the Russian Navy&#x27;s Akula-II could be equipped with 28 nuclear-capable cruise missiles with a striking range of , the Indian version is reportedly armed with the -range Club-S nuclear-capable missiles. Missiles with ranges greater than cannot be exported due to arms control restrictions, since Russia is a signatory to the MTCR treaty.

In June 2021, &quot;Nerpa&quot; was reported in Singapore with Indian crew aboard and on its way back to Russia, despite one year remaining of the 10-year lease, commenced in April 2012. The stated reason was problems with maintenance of the nuclear reactors. Accordingly, the lease will not be prolonged after 2022, as was initially expected.

=== Chakra III ===
Russia said in December 2014 that it is ready to lease India more nuclear-powered submarines a day after President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to deepen defence ties.

In January 2015, it was reported that India was involved in negotiations involving the leasing of the &quot;Kashalot&quot; and the &quot;Iribis&quot;. 

On 7 March 2019, India and Russia signed a $3 billion deal for lease of another &quot;Akula&quot;-class nuclear-powered attack submarine. The submarine, dubbed as &quot;Chakra III&quot;, should be delivered to the Indian Navy by 2025.

As of November 2024, the deal was delayed until at least 2028 according to multiple sources.

<text>Zhanjiang is a port city on the southwestern panhandle of Guangdong province in South China. The prefecture-level city of Zhanjiang administers the whole of Leizhou Peninsula, facing Haikou city of Hainan across the Qiongzhou Strait.

As of the 2020 census, its population was 6,981,236 (6,994,832 in 2010) whom 1,931,455 lived in the built-up (or metro) area consisting of four urban districts: Chikan, Xiashan, Potou, and Mazhang. In 2007, the city was named China&#x27;s top ten livable cities by Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum.

==History==
===Imperial China era===
During the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), the area belonged to Xiang Shire. The imperial government of the Han dynasty (206 BC−220 AD) set Xuwen County as the administrator of the whole Leizhou Peninsula. It was one of the earliest departure points on the Maritime Silk Road. It was a city port soon after.
Great numbers of Putian colonists settled in the Leizhou peninsula, establishing colonies during the Song empire. They soon formed the Leizhou peninsula&#x27;s linguistic and ethnic majority, while others like the Baiyue, Cantonese, Tanka, foreigners lived on the coast of the peninsula.

===French leased territory===

The region served as a small fishing port when it was occupied by the French in 1898. The next year, the French forced the Chinese to lease a small enclave of Zhanjiang to them for 99 years (until 1997), as the British Empire did in Hong Kong&#x27;s New Territories and as the Germans did in the Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory, as the territory of Kouang-Tchéou-Wan. The local population fled before the arrival of the French, so upon French invitation, Cantonese peasants from north of Leizhou came to repopulate the empty French possession, thus the local language of communication was changed to Yue Chinese. The French wanted to develop the port, which they called Fort-Bayard, to serve southern China, in parts where France had exclusive rights to railway and mineral development. Their efforts, however, were hindered by the poverty of the surrounding land. The French controlled the small enclave until 1943, when the Japanese occupied the area during World War II. At the end of the war, the enclave was briefly ceded to the French before being formally returned to China in 1946 by General Charles de Gaulle, then the French head of state.

===Return to China===
Upon recovering the territory from the French, the Republic of China government decided to rename Kouang-Tchéou-Wan. The area was historically under the jurisdiction of Zhanchuan county, with a Zhanchuan customs post on the eastern island of the territory. As &quot;Zhanjiang&quot; was a historical variant of &quot;Zhanchuan&quot;, it was decided to name the city &quot;Zhanjiang&quot;.

Following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1949, Zhanjiang developed new importance. From 1957, Zhanjiang has developed into a major modern port serving southern China, usable by ships of up to 50,000 tons. In 1984 Zhanjiang was designated one of the &quot;open&quot; cities of China, where the central government invited foreign investment; this spurred the city&#x27;s further industrial development. It has shipyards and engineering works; automobile, electrical-appliance, and textile plants; and sugar refineries, flour and rice mills, and chemical works.

In the early 1990s a new rail line was completed, linking Zhanjiang with Guangzhou, the provincial capital. The line was later extended to Hai&#x27;an, at the southernmost tip of Leizhou Peninsula, where trains could be transported by Guangdong–Hainan Ferry (part of the Guangdong–Hainan Railway) across the Hainan Strait to Haikou city.

==Geography==

Zhanjiang is to the southwest of the city of Guangzhou on an inlet of the South China Sea. It is on the eastern coast of the Leizhou Peninsula.

The spoken language in Potou District and other districts is Yue Chinese brought by Cantonese peasants that trace their ancestry to rural Guangdong during the French occupation of downtown while the Min speaking majority fled before the French arrived. Leizhou Min is the prestige language spoken in Xiashan District, Mazhang District, Xuwen County, Leizhou City, etc. The dialect in Lianjiang County is Hakka Chinese.

== Climate ==
Zhanjiang has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa), with short, mild, overcast winters and long, very hot, humid summers. The monthly daily average temperature in January is 16.2 °C (60.6 °F), and in July is 29.1 °C (84.2 °F). From April to September, rainfall is the heaviest and most frequent. The summer and winter temperatures are moderated due to the influence of the nearby ocean.

==Administration==
Zhanjiang has direct jurisdiction over nine county-level divisions:

==Military==
Zhanjiang serves as headquarters of the South Sea Fleet of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy. It is also home base to the and 2nd Marine Brigades.

==Economy==
Zhanjiang is a port city and trade center with a diversified industrial base, including a shipyard, textile plants, sugar refineries. plants producing automobiles, chemicals and electrical appliances as well as rice mills. From 2012 to 2014, economy of Zhanijang grew to a new level. In 2013, with 92 different key projects, the total investment reaches 306.9 million. In 2014, the GDP of Zhanjiang was 225.87 billion yuan. The growth of GDP was 10 percent. Industrial enterprises above designated size added value of 73.49 billion yuan. Fixed Investment was 102 billion yuan and the growth was about 30 percent. Also, the total retail sales of consumer goods was 116 million dollars with growth of 13.e percent. The government believes that the GDP of Zhanjiang will be double on 2017 to achieve 400 billion and the speed of GDP growth will stay nearly 12 percent. With the opening up of the Wushi oil field in the South China sea, off the coast of Zhanjiang in 2016, the city has assumed further importance in the oil and gas exploration activities in the South China Sea.

===Port of Zhanjiang===
The Port of Zhanjiang is one of the finest deep water ports in China. Its historical name was Guangzhouwan. It is the southernmost port on the coast of mainland China and serves as a shipping outlet for much of Southwest China. The port of Zhanjiang, built in 1956, was the first modern port designed and developed after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and serves as the headquarters for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy&#x27;s South Sea Fleet. The Zhanjiang Port is one of the eight major ports in China, with an annual throughput of more than 2,600 million tons. As a natural port, it has a depth of approximately and three islands outside to support. The port allows easy access to the ocean from provinces in South and West China, and also allows Zhanjiang to be open to navigation with more than 100 countries. It is important to the development of steel industry in Zhanjiang. The port also services off shore support vessels plying to oil rigs and craft in the Wushi oil field.

===Agriculture===
Sugarcane production was Zhanjiang&#x27;s most prominent agricultural product in 2007: in 2006 it was 9,135,500 tons and it was 10,000,000 tons in 2007. Akoya cultured pearls, pineapples, bananas, papayas, seafood, farm-raised prawns and fish are other products that play a prominent role in the agricultural economy of Zhanjiang.

In 2014, the modern agriculture of Zhanjiang keeps increasing. There were 14 new leading enterprises of agriculture in the city. And the high-standard basic farmland increased 730 thousands mu of land.

With the effect of Guangdong and Taiwan Agricultural Cooperation Project, Zhanjiang and Taiwan keeps increasing the depth of cooperation. The aspects of cooperation includes tropical products, fishery industry, animal husbandry and ecological agriculture. The government is trying to improve the platform of cooperation and construct more test sites for cooperative agricultural experiments.

===Industry===
Industrial economy to make a breakthrough, a marked increase in the number of units. Zhanjiang in 2007 of all industrial output value of 112.134 billion yuan, up 17.1 percent, a growth rate of nearly four-year high of 15.3 billion net increase over the previous year. In 2007 the city&#x27;s industrial enterprises above designated size reached 714, 71 more than the year before, industrial output value of over 100 million of the 132 enterprises.

Zhanjiang Economic and Technological Development Zone was founded in 1984. Its total planned area is . The zone has a very good location for transportation. It is very convenient to get to the airport, the national highway G325 as well as the port. The major industries in the zone including automobile assembly, biotechnology and computer software.

The steel industry is developing during 2010 to 2013. The large-scale project of iron, steel and petrochemical began to construct in 2013. This project is aimed at promoting the local economy by producing 15 million metric tons of crude oil and 1 million tons of ethylene annually when the operation of the steel industry activate in 2017. The expected output of the project is near 300 billion yuan which will stimulate the development of economy of Zhanjiang notably. The main market of the steel industry will focus South China and Southeast Asia. But the protect of environment also becomes an important issue during the growth of industry. 8% of 50 billion yuan total investment in this project will be used to environmental protection and energy saving.

BASF announced the start of a US$10 billion investment project in November 2019. A ″Verbund″ site for the production of engineering plastics and thermoplastic polyurethane is expected to be operational by 2022. The site would be the third-largest BASF site worldwide, following Ludwigshafen, Germany, and Antwerp, Belgium.

===Business===
In 2007, the total value of retail sales of consumer goods in Zhanjiang totaled 38.216 billion yuan, an increase of 19.5% over the previous 12 years.

In 2014, Zhanjiang constructed a French-style street with the theme of travel and leisure.

<doc id="612400" wikidata="Q1236424" url="?curid=612400" title="Salvius Tryphon">
<text>Salvius Tryphon was an aulos player who was proclaimed king by the rebelling slaves of ancient Sicily during the Second Servile War against Rome.

==The Second Servile War==
In 104 BC the Consul Gaius Marius was recruiting soldiers (legionaries and Italian and foreign auxiliaries) for the war against the Cimbri and Teutones in Gaul. He requested support from King Nicomedes III of Bithynia and was refused, on the grounds that every able-bodied man in Bithynia had been enslaved by Roman tax-farmers for being unable to pay their dues. The Senate issued orders that no slaves were to be taken from among the allies of Rome, and that all such slaves should be immediately freed.

The Roman Propraetor of Sicily Publius Licinius Nerva, in obedience to the edict, at once freed around 800 slaves in his province; aside from awakening discontent among slaves from other nationalities who were not freed, this had the effect of alienating rich plantation owners who saw their slaves being taken from them. Alarmed, Nerva revoked the sentence of manumission, which provoked the slave population into revolt.

==King Tryphon==
Nerva then failed to react with decision; by false promises he was able to return one body of the rebels to slavery, while neglecting to address a more serious outbreak near Heraclea. A troop of 600 soldiers which he finally dispatched to quell this revolt was beaten and slaughtered; the slaves now gained confidence, having won a large supply of armaments and a strong leader, a former slave called Salvius. Following the example of Eunus, the slave-leader of the First Servile War, who had proclaimed himself an Antiochus of the Seleucid line, Salvius assumed the name Tryphon, from Diodotus Tryphon, a Seleucid ruler.

===Morgantia===
After his victory Salvius turned to besiege the city of Morgantia. Nerva tried to relieve the city but was badly beaten by Salvius&#x27; slave army. After they took Morgantia the rebel army&#x27;s ranks grew until they numbered 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. Athenion, another slave turned rebel, meanwhile rose in the west of Sicily, and marched to join his forces with Salvius&#x27;s.

===Rome Strikes Back===
The Senate sent the &quot;praetor perginus&quot; Lucullus to crush the rebellion. Salvius planned to respond to Lucullus&#x27; arrival by withdrawing into his fortress of Triocala and there hold out against the Romans. However, his general Athenion prevailed upon him not to hide behind the walls of and instead face the Romans in open battle. Marching to meet Lucullus, the rebels encamped at Scirthaea, twelve miles distant from the Roman camp. The next day, the two sides prepared for battle. According to Diodorus, Tryphon&#x27;s host numbered around 40,000 against Lucullus&#x27; 14,000. After much skirmishing, the main battle began as the two armies closed the gap separating them from their enemies and came together. At first it seemed as if the rebels would drive the Romans back, with Athenion and his cavalry inflicting heavy losses upon Lucullus. However, just as it seemed that the slaves might be victorious, Athenion was wounded and cut down from his horse. He was forced to feign death in order to save himself. The rebels, believing their brave general to be dead, lost heart and fled. Salvius Tryphon seeing his army vanishing before him, turned and joined them in flight back to his refuge in Triocala. Later that night, under cover of darkness, the wounded Athenion also escaped. With thousands of slaves cut down in the rout, Diodorus estimates that, as night fell, around 20,000 rebels lay dead, half of Tryphon&#x27;s army destroyed and Lucullus victorious.

While laying siege to the rebels stronghold Lucullus was recalled and it is alleged, spitefully cut short his campaign, retreating and burning provisions to render the task harder for his successor, Gaius Servilius.

==Death==
Salvius Tryphon died sometime after the battle of Scirthaea and was succeeded by Athenion. The Slave Revolt was crushed in 101 by the consul Manius Aquillius who supposedly killed Athenion with his own hand.

<doc id="612401" wikidata="Q4981213" url="?curid=612401" title="Midfield">
<text>In many sports, midfield is the part of a sports field that is near the line that is equally far from the end lines. That is, in American football it is the part of the field near the 50-yard line; in association football (soccer) and field hockey it is the part of the field that is between but roughly equally far from the two goalies. In association football, a player who is a &quot;left midfieler&quot;, &quot;center midfielder&quot;, or &quot;right midfielder&quot; plays much of the game in the midfield, whereas an &quot;attacker&quot; or &quot;forward&quot; plays closer to the opponent&#x27;s goalie and a &quot;defender&quot; or &quot;back&quot; plays closer to the player&#x27;s team&#x27;s goalie.

In these sports, center field is the part of the sports field that is near the line that connects the midpoints of the end lines. That is, in association football or field hockey, it is the part of the field near the line that could be drawn to connect the two goalies; in American football it would connect the two uprights. In association football, a player who is a &quot;center forward&quot;, &quot;center midfielder&quot; or &quot;center back&quot; plays much of the game along this line, whereas, from the perspective of the player&#x27;s goalie&#x27;s view, other players will be &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;.

In association football, the terms can be combined to give &quot;left forward&quot;, &quot;center forward&quot;, &quot;right forward&quot;, &quot;left midfielder, &quot;center midfielder&quot;, &quot;right midfielder&quot;, &quot;left back&quot;, &quot;center back&quot;, &quot;right back&quot;, and even subtler combinations such as &quot;left defensive-midfielder&quot;, &quot;right-center back&quot;, and &quot;center attacking-midfielder&quot;.

In contrast, the term midfield in baseball and cricket is used to describe the area between the infield (within the bases or near the wickets) and the outfield. In baseball, center field is the part of the outfield between left field and right field, and can be reached by going in a line from home plate past second base into the outfield.

He was promoted to major on 1 October 1935. During the Second World War, he was wounded and captured during Operation Market-Garden. He retired on 1 September 1948 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel.

He was elected Member of Parliament for Tiverton in 1945 (a constituency previously held by his grandfather Sir John Heathcoat-Amory, 1st Baronet). When the Conservatives came to power under Winston Churchill in 1951 he was appointed Minister of Pensions. In September 1953 he was appointed Minister of State for Trade. He joined Churchill&#x27;s Cabinet in July 1954 succeeding Sir Thomas Dugdale as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (continuing his responsibilities as Minister of State for Trade). In October 1954 these ministries merged under Heathcoat-Amory&#x27;s leadership. The Hon. Gwilym Lloyd George &quot;later&quot; Viscount Tenby had previously been charged with Food ministerial affairs. He remained in this post until being appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1958, by Harold Macmillan, an office he held until 1960. A highlight of Amory&#x27;s chancellorship was the raising of the Bank Rate to 6% in June 1960, in an effort to cool the economy after the election the previous autumn.

He stood down from the House of Commons in 1960 and was raised to the peerage as Viscount Amory, of Tiverton in the County of Devon, on 1 September of that year. From 1965 to 1970, he was Governor (Company Chairman) of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, North America&#x27;s oldest company (established by English royal charter in 1670). Viscount Amory was sworn of the Privy Council in 1953, and appointed GCMG in 1961 and KG in 1968. He also received the degree of Hon. LLD (Exon) in 1959, before serving as Chancellor of Exeter University from 1972 to 1981.

==Personal life==
Heathcoat-Amory was an accomplished sailor, who had his yacht brought up the Thames to take him away after making Budget speeches when Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Civil Service Sailing Association continues to award the annual &quot;Heathcoat Amory Trophy&quot; (donated by Viscount Amory) for outstanding sailing achievements by its members.

In 1972, Lord Amory succeeded his brother in the family baronetcy; he died unmarried at his home in Chevithorne on 20 January 1981, aged 81. The viscountcy became extinct upon his death and his younger brother succeeded him as Sir William Heathcoat-Amory, 5th Baronet, DSO.

<text>The Byzantine senate or Eastern Roman senate (, , or , ) was a continuation of the Roman Senate, established in the 4th century by Constantine I. It survived for centuries, but the senate&#x27;s powers varied greatly during its history and gradually diminished until its eventual disappearance in the 14th century.

The senate of the Byzantine Empire originally consisted of Roman senators who happened to live in the East, or those who wanted to move to Constantinople, and a few other bureaucrats who were appointed to the senate. Constantine offered free land and grain to any Roman senators who were willing to move to the East. When Constantine founded the Eastern senate in Byzantium, it initially resembled the councils of important cities like Antioch rather than the Roman Senate. His son Constantius II raised it from the position of a municipal to that of an imperial body but the senate in Constantinople had essentially the same limited powers as the senate in Rome. Constantius II increased the number of senators to 2,000 by including his friends, courtiers, and various provincial officials.

==Admission and composition==
The traditional principles that senatorial rank was hereditary and that the normal way of becoming a member of the senate itself was by holding a magistracy still remained in full force. By the time of the permanent division of the Roman Empire in 395, praetors&#x27; responsibilities had been reduced to a purely municipal role. Their sole duty was to manage the spending of money on the exhibition of games or on public works. However, with the decline of the other traditional Roman offices such as that of tribune the praetorship remained an important portal through which aristocrats could gain access to either the Western or Eastern Senates. The praetorship was a costly position to hold as praetors were expected to possess a treasury from which they could draw funds for their municipal duties. There are known to have been eight praetors in the Eastern Roman Empire who shared the financial burden between them. The late eastern Roman senate was very different from the Republican senate as the offices of aedile and tribune had long fallen into abeyance and by the end of the 4th century the quaestorship was on the point of disappearing, save as a provincial magistrate. The emperor or the senate itself could also issue a decree to grant a man not born into the senatorial order a seat in the senate. Exemption from the expensive position of praetor would also often be conferred on such persons that had become senators in this way.

The senate was mostly composed of statesmen and officials, ranging from the most important statesmen in the Empire such as the Master of Offices and the Master of Soldiers to provincial governors and retired civil servants. The senatorial families in Constantinople tended to be less affluent and less distinguished than those in the West (where the size of the senate had also been increased to 2,000 in the 4th century). Some aristocrats attempted to become senators in order to escape the difficult conditions that were imposed on them by late Roman emperors such as Diocletian (r. 284-305 AD). The &quot;curiales&quot; (Roman middle class) were often forced to become decurions where they were charged with participating in local government at their own expense as well as having to collect taxes and pay any deficits from their own pockets. As it was recognised that many who sought seats in the senate were doing so primarily to escape the harsh duties of the decurion Theodosius I decreed that they must complete their public service even if they became senators.

The senate was led by the Prefect of the City (Constantinople), who conducted all of its communications with the emperor. It was composed of three orders, the &quot;illustres&quot;, &quot;spectabiles&quot; and &quot;clarissimi&quot;. The members of the &quot;illustres&quot; were those who held the highest offices in Eastern Rome, such as the master of soldiers and praetorian prefects. The &quot;spectabiles&quot; formed the middle class of the senate and consisted of important statesmen such as proconsuls, vicars and military governors of the provinces. The &quot;clarissimi&quot; was the lower class of the senate and was attached to the governors of the provinces and to other lesser posts. Members of the lower two orders were permitted to live anywhere within the Empire and were generally inactive senators. The majority of active members in the senate were the &quot;illustres&quot;, whose important offices were usually based in Constantinople and so were able to attend the senate frequently. By the end of the 5th century the two lower classes were completely excluded from sitting in the senate. During the reign of Justinian I the numbers of &quot;clarissimi&quot; were significantly increased which caused many officials to be promoted to the rank of &quot;spectabiles&quot; and this in turn caused there to be an increase of the numbers of &quot;illustres&quot;, which had previously been the elite class of the senate. As a result, a new order, the &quot;gloriosi&quot;, was created to accommodate the highest ranking senators. It is important to note that being a Senator was generally a secondary career for most of the senate&#x27;s members, who usually possessed important positions within the administrative machinery of the Empire.

==Powers and functions==
Whilst the powers of the senate were limited, it could pass resolutions (&quot;senatus consulta&quot;) which the Emperor might adopt and issue in the form of edicts. It could thus suggest Imperial legislation, and it acted from time to time as a consultative body. Some Imperial laws took the form of &#x27;Orations to the senate&#x27;, and were read aloud before the body. The Western Roman emperor Valentinian III in 446 formulated a legislative procedure which granted to the senate the right of co-operation, where any new law was to be discussed at a meeting between the senate and the council before being confirmed by the emperor. This procedure was included in Justinian&#x27;s code although it is unclear whether it was fully adopted in the East. In addition the emperor would use the senate as a judicial court, and trials for high treason were sometimes referred to it. Ordinary crimes would also often be judged by a court consisting of the prefect of the city and five senators chosen by lot. The senate also maintained constitutional significance in that officially emperors were to be chosen by the military and the senate, although succession was almost always hereditary.

==Confrontations with the emperor==

There were incidents when the senate confronted the emperor and attempted to assert authority on the basis of their constitutional importance regarding the succession of an Emperor. In 457 they offered to enthrone the master of soldiers, the Alan Aspar, but the tribune and senator Leo I, who was Aspar&#x27;s subordinate, became emperor instead. In 532, some of the senators gave their support to the Nika rioters against Justinian I, who did not like or trust the wealthy senate. After 541, the senate lost many of its members due to a plague pandemic and during the ensuing economic turmoil, Justinian confiscated the wealth of many of the remaining senators. In 608 during the rule of Phocas, Heraclius the Elder and his son Heraclius were declared consuls with the backing of senate members in Carthage. Heraclius later was elected emperor. Previous emperor Phocas was deposed by the senate and arrested in a church by two senators.

When Emperor Heraclius died in 641, he left the Empire to be ruled by two of his sons: Constantine III from his first marriage with Eudokia and Heraklonas from his second marriage with Martina. Empress Martina demanded imperial power for herself (although most likely with intended favor for her son), and declared this in a grand ceremony held in the Hippodrome of Constantinople which was attended by the senate, other high officials and people of Constantinople. Opinion of the senate and the people being strongly against her, wanting Heraclius&#x27; sons to rule, Martina was forced to return to the Great Palace of Constantinople in defeat. However, Constantine died only four months later, leaving his half-brother Heraklonas as sole ruler, and rumours of Martina having assassinated him started to spread. Soon afterwards, a revolt led by general of the army named Valentinus began, and Heraklonas was forced to accept his young nephew Constans II, son of Constantine, as co-ruler. As a part of the negotiations, David brother of Heraklonas was also crowned as co-emperor. This, however, did not ease the discontent among the senate and the people, and soon the senate deposed Heraklonas. His nose was slit, Martina&#x27;s tongue cut out and they were exiled to Rhodes. Constans II became sole emperor, under the regency of the senate.
== Decline ==
The senate&#x27;s power was gradually reduced over the course of history, although it still existed into the 13th century. From the seventh century on, it could be said that it was less of an institution than a class of dignitaries, as many of its remaining powers as a body were removed under legal reforms by the emperors Basil I and Leo VI. 

The senate itself retained considerable prestige, especially in the 11th century when the &quot;court party&quot; came to power following the death of Basil II. With the final triumph of the military faction on the accession of Alexios I Komnenos, the senate began to fade into irrelevance and the title of senator could be bought from the emperor. In 1197 the senate was assembled—along with the clergy and guildsmen of the capital—to approve a special tax, the Alamanikon. The senators refused to be assessed for the tax, as it was contrary to custom, and the emperor was forced to tax the provinces and exempt the capital. The senate&#x27;s last known act was to elect Nikolaos Kanabos as emperor in opposition to Isaac II and Alexius IV during the Fourth Crusade. Under the Palaeologus dynasty the title of senator survived for a time, but in the crises of the mid 14th century the ancient office, said to have been founded 2,000 years prior by the first Roman leader, Romulus, finally vanished for good.

==Senate houses==
There were two senate houses in Constantinople. One, built by Constantine and restored by Justinian, was on the east side of the Augustaion, close to the Imperial Palace, at Magnaura, whilst the other was on the north side of the Forum of Constantine. The senate lost its houses in the 6th century and from then on assembled in the Great Palace of Constantinople.

<text>Speusippus (; ; c. 408 – 339/8 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher. Speusippus was Plato&#x27;s nephew by his sister Potone. After Plato&#x27;s death, c. 348 BC, Speusippus inherited the Academy, near age 60, and remained its head for the next eight years. However, following a stroke, he passed the chair to Xenocrates. Although the successor to Plato in the Academy, Speusippus frequently diverged from Plato&#x27;s teachings. He rejected Plato&#x27;s Theory of Forms, and whereas Plato had identified the Good with the ultimate &quot;principle&quot;, Speusippus maintained that the Good was merely secondary. He also argued that it is impossible to have satisfactory knowledge of any thing without knowing all the differences by which it is separated from everything else.

The standard edition of the surviving fragments and testimonies is Leonardo Tarán&#x27;s &quot;Speusippus of Athens: A Critical Study with a Collection of the Related Texts and Commentary&quot; (1982).

==Life==
Speusippus was a native of Athens, and the son of Eurymedon and Potone, a sister of Plato, he belonged to the deme of Myrrhinus. The pseudonymous &quot;Thirteenth Letter of Plato&quot; claims that Speusippus married his niece (his mother&#x27;s granddaughter). We hear nothing of his life until the time when he accompanied his uncle Plato on his third journey to Syracuse (Italy), where he displayed considerable ability and prudence, especially in his amicable relations with Dion. His moral worth is recognised even by Timon, though only that he may heap the more unsparing ridicule on his intellect.

The report about his sudden fits of anger, his greed, and his debauchery, are probably derived from a very impure source: Athenaeus and Diogenes Laërtius can adduce as authority for them scarcely anything more than the abuse in some spurious letters of Dionysius the Younger, who was banished by Dion, with the cooperation of Speusippus. Having been selected by Plato as his successor as the leader (&quot;scholarch&quot;) of the Academy, he was at the head of the school for only eight years (348/7–339/8 BC). He died, it appears, of a lingering paralytic illness, presumably a stroke. He was succeeded as the head of the school by Xenocrates.

==Philosophy==
Diogenes Laërtius gives us a list of some of the titles of the many dialogues and commentaries of Speusippus, which is of little help in determining their contents, and the fragments provided by other writers provide us with only a little extra.

===Epistemology===
Speusippus was interested in bringing together those things which were similar in their philosophical treatment, and in the derivation, and laying down, of the ideas of genera and species: for he was interested in what the various sciences had in common, and how they might be connected. Thus he furthered the threefold division of philosophy into Dialectics, Ethics, and Physics, for which Plato had laid the foundation, without losing sight of the mutual connection of these three branches of philosophy. Speusippus maintained that no one could arrive at a complete definition who did not know all the differences by which a thing which was to be defined was separated from the rest.

Like Plato, Speusippus distinguished between that which is the object of thought, and that which is the object of sensuous perception, between the cognition of the reason and sensuous perception. He tried, however, to show how perception can be taken up and transformed into knowledge, by the assumption of a perception, which, by participation in rational truth, raises itself to the rank of knowledge. By this he seems to have understood an immediate (in the first instance aesthetic) mode of conception; since he appealed, in support of this view, to the consideration that artistic skill has its foundation, not in sensuous activity, but in an unerring power of distinguishing between its objects, that is, in a rational perception of them.

===Metaphysics===
Speusippus rejected Plato&#x27;s Theory of Forms; whereas Plato distinguished between ideal numbers (i.e. the Platonic Forms of numbers) and mathematical numbers, Speusippus rejected the ideal numbers, and consequently the ideas. He tried to determine the idea of substance more distinctly by separating its types, the difference between which he considered would result from the difference between the &quot;principles&quot; (&quot;archai&quot;) on which they are based. Thus he distinguished substances of number, of size, of soul, while Plato had referred them, as separate entities, to the ideal numbers. 
Speusippus made still more kinds of substance, beginning with the One, and assuming principles for each kind of substance, one for numbers, another for spatial magnitudes, and then another for the soul; and by going on in this way he multiplies the kinds of substance.
Nevertheless, Speusippus also must have recognised something common in those different kinds of substances, inasmuch as, firstly, he set out from the absolute One, and regarded it as a formal &quot;principle&quot; which they had in common, and, secondly, he appears to have assumed that multitude and multiformity was a common primary element in their composition. But it is only the difficulties which led him to make this and similar deviations from the Platonist doctrine, of which we can get any clear idea, not the way in which he thought he had avoided those difficulties by distinguishing different kinds of &quot;principles&quot;. The criticism of Aristotle, directed apparently against Speusippus, shows how little satisfied he was with the modification of the original Platonist doctrine.

With this deviation from Plato&#x27;s doctrine is connected another which takes a wider range. As the ultimate &quot;principle&quot;, Speusippus would not, with Plato, recognise the &quot;Good&quot;, but, with others (who doubtless were also Platonists), going back to the older &quot;Theologi&quot;, maintained that the &quot;principles&quot; of the universe were to be set down as causes of the good and perfect, but were not the good and perfect itself, which must rather be regarded as the result of generated existence, or development, just as the seeds of plants and animals are not the fully formed plants or animals themselves.
Speusippus [supposes] that supreme beauty and goodness are not present in the beginning, because the beginnings both of plants and of animals are causes, but beauty and completeness are in the effects of these.

The ultimate &quot;principle&quot; he designated, like Plato, as the absolute One, but it was not to be regarded as an existing entity, since all entities can only be the result of development. When, however, with the Pythagoreans, he reckoned the &quot;One&quot; in the series of &quot;good&quot; things, he probably conceived it only in its opposition to the &quot;Many&quot;, and wished to indicate that it was from the &quot;One&quot; and not from the &quot;Many&quot;, that the good and perfect is to be derived. Nevertheless, Speusippus seems to have attributed vital activity to the primordial Unity, as inseparably belonging to it, probably in order to explain how it could grow, by a process of self-development, into the good, spirit, etc.; for spirit also he distinguished from the one, as well as from the good; and the good from pleasure and pain. Less worthy of notice is the attempt by Speusippus to find a more suitable expression for the material &quot;principle&quot;, the indefinite duality of Plato; and his Pythagorizing mode of treating the doctrine of numbers which we can see in the extracts of his treatise on the Pythagorean numbers.

===Ethics===

Diogenes Laertius&#x27; list of Speusippus&#x27; works includes titles on justice, friendship, pleasure, and wealth. Clement of Alexandria (fr. 77 Tarán) reports that Speusippus considered happiness to be &quot;a state that is complete in those things that are in accordance with nature, a condition desired by all human beings, while the Good aim at freedom from disturbance; and the virtues would be productive of happiness.&quot; This testimony suggests that Speusippus&#x27; ethics may have been an important background to ethical ideas of the Stoics (the will&#x27;s conformity with nature) and Epicureans (compare &quot;freedom from disturbance,&quot; &quot;aochlēsia&quot;, with the notion of &quot;ataraxia&quot;).

Modern scholars have detected a polemic between Speusippus and Eudoxus of Cnidus concerning the good. Eudoxus also accepts that the Good will be that at which all people aim, but identifies this as pleasure, as opposed to Speusippus&#x27; exclusive focus on moral goods. Texts of Aristotle and Aulus Gellius suggest that Speusippus insisted that pleasure was not a good, but that the Good was &quot;in between the opposites of pleasure and pain.&quot; It is possible that the dispute between Speusippus and Eudoxus influenced Plato&#x27;s &quot;Philebus&quot; (esp. 53c–55a).

Speusippus also seems to have developed further Plato&#x27;s ideas of justice and of the citizen, and the fundamental principles of legislation.

<text>Hans Freudenthal (17 September 1905 – 13 October 1990) was a Jewish German-born Dutch mathematician. He made substantial contributions to algebraic topology and also took an interest in literature, philosophy, history and mathematics education.

==Biography==
Freudenthal was born in Luckenwalde, Brandenburg, on 17 September 1905, the son of a Jewish teacher. He was interested in both mathematics and literature as a child, and studied mathematics at the University of Berlin beginning in 1923. He met L. E. J. Brouwer in 1927, when Brouwer came to Berlin to give a lecture, and in the same year Freudenthal also visited the University of Paris. He completed his thesis work with Heinz Hopf at Berlin, defended a thesis on the ends of topological groups in 1930, and was officially awarded a degree in October 1931. After defending his thesis in 1930, he moved to Amsterdam to take up a position as assistant to Brouwer. In this pre-war period in Amsterdam, he was promoted to lecturer at the University of Amsterdam, and married his wife, Suus Lutter, a Dutch teacher.

Although he was a German Jew, Freudenthal&#x27;s position in the Netherlands insulated him from the anti-Jewish laws that had been passed in Germany beginning with the Nazi rise to power in 1933. However, in 1940 the Germans invaded the Netherlands, following which Freudenthal was suspended from duties at the University of Amsterdam by the Nazis. In 1943 Freudenthal was sent to a labor camp in the village of Havelte in the Netherlands, but with the help of his wife (who, as a non-Jew, had not been deported) he escaped in 1944 and went into hiding with his family in occupied Amsterdam. During this period Freudenthal occupied his time in literary pursuits, including winning first prize under a false name in a novel-writing contest.

With the war over, Freudenthal&#x27;s position at the University of Amsterdam was returned to him, but in 1946 he was given a chair in pure and applied mathematics and foundations of mathematics at Utrecht University, where he remained for the rest of his career. He served as the 8th president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction from 1967 to 1970. In 1971 he founded the Institute for the Development of Mathematical Education (IOWO) at Utrecht University, which after his death was renamed the Freudenthal Institute. In 1972 he founded and became editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Geometriae Dedicata&quot;. He retired from his professorship in 1975 and from his journal editorship in 1981. He died in Utrecht in 1990, sitting on a bench in a park where he always took a morning walk.

==Contributions==
In his thesis work, published as a journal article in 1931, Freudenthal introduced the concept of an end of a topological space. Ends are intended to capture the intuitive idea of a direction in which the space extends to infinity, but have a precise mathematical formulation in terms of covers of the space by nested sequences of compact sets. Ends remain of great importance in topological group theory, Freudenthal&#x27;s motivating application, and also in other areas of mathematics such as the study of minimal surfaces.

In 1936, while working with Brouwer, Freudenthal proved the Freudenthal spectral theorem on the existence of uniform approximations by simple functions in Riesz spaces. In 1937 he proved the Freudenthal suspension theorem, showing that the suspension operation on topological spaces shifts by one their low-dimensional homotopy groups; this result was important in understanding the homotopy groups of spheres (since every sphere can be formed topologically as a suspension of a lower-dimensional sphere) and eventually formed the basis of stable homotopy theory. The Freudenthal magic square is a construction in Lie algebra developed by Freudenthal (and independently by Jacques Tits) in the 1950s and 1960s, associating each Lie algebra to a pair of division algebras.

In 1968, Freudenthal founded the journal, &quot;Educational Studies in Mathematics&quot; (ESM). Becoming one of the top-rated journals in the field of mathematics education, ESM was focused on publishing research around finding better ways to teach mathematics.

Later in his life, Freudenthal focused on elementary mathematics education. In the 1970s, his single-handed intervention prevented the Netherlands from following the worldwide trend of &quot;new math&quot;. He was also a fervent critic of one of the first international school achievement studies. He interpreted mathematics as a human activity where students should open a scientific eye on the world around them, mathematizing real situations, in a context that makes sense for the students. This approach is called &quot;Realistic Mathematics Education&quot; (RME).

Freudenthal published the Impossible Puzzle, a mathematical puzzle that appears to lack sufficient information for a solution, in 1969. He also designed a constructed language, Lincos, to make possible communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.

==Awards and honors==
In 1951, Freudenthal became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was also an honorary member of the International Academy of the History of Science.
He was awarded the Gouden Ganzenveer award in 1984.

In 2000, the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction instituted an award named in honor of Freudenthal, the Hans Freudenthal Medal. It is given in odd-numbered years (beginning in 2003) for an &quot;outstanding achievement in mathematics education research&quot; in the form of &quot;a major cumulative program of research&quot;. Recipients of the medal have included Celia Hoyles, Paul Cobb, Anna Sfard, Yves Chevallard, Luis Radford and Frederick Leung.

The asteroid 9689 Freudenthal is named after him.

<text>The Nùng (&quot;pronounced as noong&quot; ) are a Central Tai-speaking ethnic group living primarily in northeastern Vietnam and southwestern Guangxi. The Nùng sometimes call themselves Thổ, which literally means &quot;&quot; (indigenous or native to the land). Their ethnonym is often mingled with that of the Tày as Tày-Nùng. According to the Vietnam census, the population of the Nùng numbered about 856,412 by 1999, 968,800 by 2009, and 1,083,298 by 2019. They are the third largest Tai-speaking group, preceded by the Tày and the Thái (Black Tai, White Tai and Red Tai groups), and sixth overall among national minority groups.

They are closely related to the Tày and the Zhuang. In China, the Nùng together with the Tày are classified as Zhuang people.

==Subdivisions==

There are several subgroups among the Nùng: Nùng Xuồng, Nùng Giang, Nùng An, Nùng Phàn Slình, Nùng Lòi, Nùng Cháo, Nùng Quý Rỉn, Nùng Dín, Nùng Inh, Nùng Tùng Slìn etc.

Many of the Nùng&#x27;s sub-group names correspond to the geographic regions of the Nùng homeland. Hoàng Nam (2008:11) lists the following Nùng subgroups.
*&quot;Nùng Inh&quot;: migrated from Long Ying
*&quot;Nùng Phàn Slình&quot;: migrated from Wan Cheng
**&quot;Nùng Phàn Slình thua lài&quot;
**&quot;Nùng Phàn Slình cúm cọt&quot;
*&quot;Nùng An&quot;: migrated from An Jie
*&quot;Nùng Dín&quot;
*&quot;Nùng Lòi&quot;: migrated from Xia Lei
*&quot;Nùng Tùng Slìn&quot;: migrated from Cong Shan
*&quot;Nùng Quý Rỉn&quot;: migrated from Gui Shun
*&quot;Nùng Cháo&quot;: migrated from Long Zhou

==Relationship to the Zhuang and Tày==

The Zhuang, Nùng, and Tày people are a cluster of Tai peoples with very similar customs and dress known as the Rau peoples. In China, the Zhuang are today the largest non-Han Chinese minority with around 14.5 million population in Guangxi Province alone. In Vietnam, as of 1999, there were 933,653 Nùng people and 1,574,822 Tày people. Recently the Tày and Nùng have been referred to as a combined Tày-Nùng minority. However these ethnonyms are a recent phenomenon and did not exist until the modern age. According to Keith Taylor, the Vietnamese terms were &quot;categories of French colonial knowledge&quot; used to differentiate highlanders from lowlanders. The ethnic Zhuang was a product of the &quot;ethnic identification project&quot; pursued in 1950s China.

Many scholars of the Tai peoples consider the Zhuang and Nùng to be essentially the same people, a single ethnic group. During the early 11th century, ethnic identities and boundaries were more fluid than in the modern Sino-Vietnamese borderland. The Zhuang leader Nong Zhigao was defeated in 1055 by the Song dynasty. Had he won, it is possible that he might have established a state under his own clan name, Nong. Instead, his people in China continued to be referred to as Zhuang, which in their own language means &quot;cave&quot;, while in Vietnam they came to be known as Nùng. The majority ethnic group and now the largest minority, however, was and still is the same, the Zhuang/Nùng, who together number more than 15 million people. They are just recognized by different names in China and Vietnam. Nong Zhigao (V. Nùng Trí Cao) has sometimes been claimed by Vietnam as a Vietnamese native, but this is due to antagonism with modern China, while in previous times the Vietnamese sometimes saw him as primarily Chinese.

Like the Nùng, the Tày (originally Thổ) would have been classified as Zhuang had they lived in China. However unlike the Nùng, the Tày are considered the most Vietnamized of all the Thai peoples in Vietnam and lacquered their teeth black like the Viets. The Tày and Nùng frequently intermarried, although the Tày seem to have been held in higher regard.

==History==
===Rise of the Nùng===
During the early Song dynasty, the Huang clan was left in charge of the You and Zuo rivers. The Wei had settled on the Song-Viet border. However the power of the Nong clan increased and began to upset Huang supremacy. By the early Song, they ruled over an area known as Temo, which stretched from modern Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in the west to Jingxi in the east and Guangyuanzhou (Quảng Nguyên, now Cao Bằng province) in the south. Emperor Taizong of Song (r. 976-997) bestowed special favors on Nong leadership, acknowledging that they had succeeded the Huang in the Zuo River region.

The first member of the Nong clan to gain official recognition was Nong Minfu. It is not known when he was born, but a memorial in early 977 states that the &quot;peaceful and generous&quot; leader Nong Minfu of Guangyuanzhou had established himself over ten neighboring villages with the support of Southern Han (907-971). Minfu had supported Duan Siping (r. 937–944) of the Dali Kingdom and was rewarded with titles. Duan rewarded another leader in Temo with the title &quot;buxie&quot;. The Song bestowed the titles &quot;minister of works&quot; (&quot;sigong&quot;) and &quot;grand master of splendid happiness bearing the golden pocket with purple trimming&quot; (&quot;jinzi guanglu daifu&quot;) on Minfu. These titles were passed onto Minfu&#x27;s son, Nong Quanfu (, ). He was also granted additional authority of Dangyouzhou (modern Jingxi, Guangxi). His younger brother, Nong Quanlu, controlled Wennaizhou (modern Na Rì District). Such preferential treatment was viewed with anger in Đại Cồ Việt, which attacked a Song garrison in 1004 after it held a banquet for a Nong chieftain.

In 1005, a woman known as A Nong was born to a notable warrior chieftain who accepted titles from both the Song dynasty and the Early Lê dynasty of Đại Cồ Việt. A Nong learned to spin and weave from her mother. At some point she was separated from the other girls and learned the ways of a shaman. She married Nong Quanfu and became his primary political adviser. Her brother, Nong Dangdao, inherited Wulezhou near Guangyuanzhou. She gave birth to Nong Zhigao in 1025. A Nong induced Quanfu to kill his brother, the leader of the Cen clan, and take his lands. The Nong clan eventually controlled 14 major grottoes (&quot;dong&quot;) in comparison to only 5 for the Huang clan.

In 1035, Quanfu declared the founding of the Kingdom of Longevity (&quot;Changsheng Guo&quot; 長生國) and took for himself the exalted title &quot;Luminous and Sage Emperor&quot; (&quot;Zhaosheng Huangdi&quot; 昭聖皇帝) while A Nong became the &quot;Enlightened and Virtuous Empress&quot; (&quot;Mingde Huanghou&quot; 明德皇后). Another source says he founded the &quot;Chang Qi Guo&quot; and styled himself the first king of Dali, &quot;Tu Dan Chao&quot;. The local prefect of Tianzhou requested assistance from Yongzhou to deal with the rebellion, but officials there appear to have feared involvement and refused to offer aid. In 1039, the emperor of the Lý dynasty, Lý Thái Tông, invaded the newly found kingdom, captured Quanfu and four other male members of the Nong clan, and executed them. A Nong escaped with the 14-year old Zhigao into Song territory.

===Nùng Trí Cao===
In 1041, Nong Zhigao and his mother seized Dangyouzhou (modern Jingxi, Guangxi) and the Leihuo grotto settlement (modern Daxin County). A Nong married a wealthy merchant but Zhigao murdered this man. A Nong married a third time to Nong Xiaqing, expanding their territory further into Temo. In 1042, Zhigao declared the founding the Kingdom of the Great Succession (&quot;Dali Guo&quot; 大歷國, not to be confused with the Kingdom of Dali 大理). Đại Cồ Việt sent troops and captured him. He was held prisoner for a year before he was released with an honorary title and given control of Guangyuan, Leihuo, Ping&#x27;an, Pinpo, and Silang in return for a share of their natural resources, particularly gold. In 1048, Zhigao declared another state, the Kingdom of the Southern Heavens (&quot;Nantian Guo&quot;), and took a reign title, &quot;Auspicious Circumstances&quot; (&quot;Jingrui&quot;). He called the Viet court&#x27;s actions criminal and that his territory would not be annexed by China. In the fall of 1049, Zhigao&#x27;s forces pillaged Yongzhou. In 1050, Đại Cồ Việt launched an attack on Zhigao&#x27;s stronghold and evicted him, sending him fleeing into Song territory.

Nong Zhigao approached the Song at Yongzhou for assistance but was denied an audience until he staged a military demonstration beneath the walls. He then presented substantial tribute (tame elephants and lumps of gold and silver) and petitioned the emperor. The prefect of Yongzhou, Chen Gong, never passed on the petition to court. However, when the tribute reached the court, the Fiscal Commissioner Xiao Gu argued to the emperor that Zhigao should be granted title. The Song court refused because it considered Zhigao&#x27;s service to be the right of Đại Cồ Việt. The military commander Yuan Yun was dispatched to attack Zhigao but instead he wanted to offer Zhigao protection, and returned to the capital with tribute, arguing for a change in policy.

Zhigao&#x27;s followers set up shop and through the mineral wealth of his holdings formed close ties with Chinese traders, including jinshi degree holders Huang Wei and Huang Shifu. He also recruited other Nong clan members such as Nong Zhizhong and Nong Jianhou. Under the influence of Huang Wei and A Nong, Zhigao decided to declare independence. In 1052, Zhigao proclaimed the establishment of the Kingdom of the Great South (&quot;Danan Guo&quot;) and granted himself the title of Benevolent and Kind Emperor (&quot;Renhui Huangdi&quot;). In the spring of 1052, Zhigao ordered the villages under his control to be burnt and led 5,000 subjects on the path to Guangzhou. By summertime, he had taken Yongzhou and reached Guangzhou, where his 50,000 strong army became bogged down in a prolonged siege. Despite cutting off Guangzhou from water, the city was well stocked with provisions, and the defenders fought back with crossbow defenses. The district magistrate Xiao Zhu foiled a waterborne attack on Guangzhou by setting fire to their ships. After 57 days, Zhigao was forced to retreat as more Song reinforcements arrived. He held out at Yongzhou, defeating five Song commanders sent against him. The Song called in a veteran of the Song–Xia wars, Di Qing, to assume command of the anti-rebel forces. He gathered 31,000 men and 32 generals, including Fanluo tribal cavalry from the northwest that &quot;were able to ascend and descend mountains as though walking on level ground.&quot; Lý Thái Tông also offered to send 20,000 troops but the offer was refused out of fear that the troops would not leave afterwards.

One general, Chen Shu, attacked early with 8,000 men and suffered a defeat against the Zhuang forces. Di Qing executed him and 31 officers. He then marched his forces under cover of night and blocked the Kunlun Pass east of Yongzhou. Zhigao attacked the Song forces in early 1054. The Zhuang wore bright crimson uniforms and fought in units of three armed with long shields that advanced &quot;like fire.&quot; One man carried a shield while the other two hurled metal-tipped bamboo javelins. In the initial stages of battle, one Song commander was killed, and the Song army was momentarily forced to fall back. In the second engagement, the Zhuang forces could not withstand the Song infantry charges. The Song infantry hacked at the Zhuang shields with heavy swords and axes while the Fanluo cavalry attacked their wings, breaking their ranks. The Zhuang fled, suffering 5,341 casualties. Di Qing retook Yongzhou and executed the jinshi-holder Huang, two of Zhigao&#x27;s family, and 57 officials. Zhigao and his remaining family fled to seek help from the Zhuang clans, but he was not well liked, and the Huang chieftain, Huang Shouling, refused to aid him. He also requested aid from the Viet court, which sent the tribal commander Võ Nhị to assist the rebels. A Nong and her son Nong Zhiguang, as well as Zhigao&#x27;s sons Nong Jifeng and Nong Jizong, were caught at Temo in Yunnan by Zhuang forces allied with the Song. They were executed. Zhigao failed to raise more troops in Dali.

According to official accounts, Nong Zhigao was executed by the ruler of Dali and his head presented to Song authorities. However popular accounts claim he fled further south into modern northern Thailand, where his descendants thrive to this day. The Zhuang of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture identify as survivors of Zhigao&#x27;s rebel movement and other groups in Dali City, Xishuangbana, and northern Thailand claim to be descended from Zhigao. Many Zhuang songs refer to him as &quot;King Nong.&quot;

===Migration===

After the defeat of Nùng Trí Cao, Many of the Nùng rebels fled to Vietnam, concentrating around Cao Bằng and Lạng Sơn provinces and became known as the Nùng. Barlow (2005) suggests that many of the original 11th-century rebels who fled to Vietnam were absorbed by the related Tày peoples of the region.

With the end of the Song–Đại Việt war in 1078, the Nùng north of the border became more sinicized by accepting greater integration into the Chinese tributary system while the Tai-speaking people south of the border in Đại Việt remained in a patron-client relationship with the Viet court. These Tai-speaking communities lived in the mountainous areas of Việt Bắc and most of their interaction with Viets was through the Các Lái, Kinh (Vietnamese) merchants who had obtained government licenses for trade in the uplands in return for tribute to the court. Assimilation with broader society was not necessary unlike in China. The Viet court ruled the frontier region using a system similar to the Chinese Tusi known as thổ ty. Thổ ty officials who governed the frontier held hereditary positions and passed on their position from generation to generation. The thổ ty were &quot;de facto&quot; rulers and held absolute authority in their own areas. They paid tribute to both Chinese and Viet authorities. As late as the 19th century, imperial presence was not guaranteed. Central expansion and assertion of authority by the Nguyễn dynasty over these areas was often met by violent local opposition. Unlike the Chinese however, the Viets did offer princesses to the thổ ty to cement allegiances. Despite this, most Nùng communities were self ruled as late as 1953 when the Viet Minh took the Việt Bắc region.

As the strongest thổ ty, Nùng Trí Cao (C. Nong Zhigao) and his family members were deified by these communities. After the Lam Sơn uprising which ended the Ming occupation, the Viet ruler Lê Lợi consolidated support from border communities by acknowledging a variety of local deities. It&#x27;s suggested that a shrine to Nùng Trí Cao, the Great King of Kỳ Sầm Temple, was erected in the western outskirts of Cao Bằng in connection to the suppression of a rebel force by Lê forces in 1431. Worship of Nùng Trí Cao was widespread by the 19th century. In 1897, it was reported that local leaders had arranged the renovation of Kỳ Sầm Temple in conjunction with the Nùng clan. On the tenth day of the first lunar month a festival was held around the temple. Apparently &quot;Han Chinese&quot; from the Qing dynasty flooded the region during the festival so that Quảng Nguyên &quot;resembled nothing more than another region of China.&quot; Another festival focused on trade was held around the temple in the third lunar month during Thanh Minh (Qingming Festival).

The Nùng, although lacking a leader of the stature of Nùng Trí Cao, rose up in 1352, 1430, 1434.

In the 16th century the Zhuang from Guangxi and perhaps from southeast Yunnan began migrating into Vietnam. This movement was accelerated by the cycle of disasters and political events of the seventeenth century which brought larger numbers of Chinese immigrants into the region, such as the fall of the Ming, the rebellion of Wu Sangui, the Qing occupation, and the Muslim revolts in Yunnan.This migration was a peaceful one which occurred family by family. French administrators later identified a number of Nùng clans in the course of their ethnographic surveys. These had incorporated Chinese place names in their clan names and indicated the place of their origin in China, such as the &quot;Nùng Inh&quot; clan from Long Ying in the southwest of Guangxi. Other names also reflected the locations from where they came, indicating that they were primarily from the immediate frontier region of the southwest of Guangxi. The Nùng became increasingly numerous in the region, and were spread out through a long stretch of the Vietnamese northern border from Lạng Sơn to Cao Bằng. The Mạc dynasty, a Vietnamese dynasty ruled over the Vietnamese northeast highlands, profited from the migration in that they were able to draw upon Nùng manpower for their own forces.

In 1833, Nông Văn Vân, a Nùng chieftain, led a rebellion against Vietnamese rule. He quickly took control of Cao Bằng, Tuyên Quang, Thái Nguyên and Lạng Sơn provinces, aiming to create a separate Tày-Nùng state in the northern region of Vietnam. His rising was eventually suppressed by the Nguyễn dynasty in 1835. In the 1860s, the Nùng sided with Sioung (Xiong), a self-proclaimed Hmong king. Sioung&#x27;s armies raided gold from Buddhist temples and seized large tracts of land from other people.

The period from the Taiping Rebellion (1850–64) to the early twentieth century was marked by continual waves of immigration by Zhuang/Nùng peoples from China into Vietnam. These waves were a result of the continuous drought of Guangxi which made the thinly occupied lands of northern Vietnam an attractive alternative habitation. The immigration process was generally a peaceful one as the Nùng purchased land from the &quot;Tho&quot; owners. The Nùng were superior to the Tho in cultivating wet rice and transformed poor lands, facilitating later migrations into adjoining areas. The repeated violent incursions of the Taiping era and the Black Flag occupation accelerated the outflow of Tho as the bands from China were largely Zhuang who favored the Nùng at the expense of the Tho. The Tho who remained became alienated from the Vietnamese government which could not offer protection and became clients of the Chinese and the Nùng.

===Colonialism===
The Nùng dominance became so pronounced that when Sun Yat-sen wished to raise fighters in the region, he could recruit them from Nùng villages such as Na Cen and Na Mo, both on the Vietnamese side of the border. The French colonists saw this Nùng predominance as a threat, and found it convenient at that time to re-assert the primacy of the Vietnamese administrative system in the region. The French colonizers of the Tonkin Protectorate also saw the Nùng as potential converts to the colonial order and portrayed them as oppressed minorities who had suffered under Chinese and Viet rule. According to a 1908 military dispatch by Commandant LeBlond, they had been &quot;subjugated and held ransom during many long centuries, sometimes by the one, sometimes by the other, the [Nùng] race has become flexible and is frequently able to ascertain the stronger [neighbor], to which it would turn instinctively. French domination appears soft to him and benevolent, compared with that of Annamites or the Chinese.&quot; During the Cần Vương movement to restore Viet independence, the Nùng showed little interest in supporting the lowland Kinh Viets against the French. Some of the upland peoples supported the Black Flag Army who fought against the French, while others sided with the French.

The French, however, perhaps having less choice, tended to support the Tho and other minorities, often undifferentiated as &quot;Man&quot; in their reports—usually a reference to Yao—as a counterweight against the Nùng. In 1908, for example, following an incident in which Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s mercenary Nùng warriors had killed several French officers, the French offered a bounty of eight dollars for each head brought in by the &quot;Man&quot;. The bounty was paid 150 times.

When the Indochinese Communist Party was founded in 1930, its policy suggested upland peoples and minorities should be given full autonomy once the French colonial order was overthrown, however such policy was given little attention until 1941 when support from these communities became a strategic necessity. The Nùng assisted Ho Chi Minh in his activities. As a result of anti-French activities, temples of Nùng Trí Cao were destroyed. The French had more success with the Tai Dón people along the Lao-border, who established a regime known as Sip Song Chau Tai (&quot;French:&quot; Pays Taï) under the control of collaborator Đèo Văn Long. When war broke out in 1946, groups of Thai, H’mong and Muong in the northwest sided with the French and against the Vietnamese and even provided battalions to fight with the French troops. But The Nùng and Tày supported the Viet Minh and provided the Vietnamese leader, Ho Chi Minh, with a safe base for his guerrilla armies. After defeating the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, the Viet Minh tried to win the allegiance of all of the northern ethnic minorities by creating two autonomous zones, Thai–Meo Autonomous Zone and Viet Bac Autonomous Zone respectively, allowing limited self-government within a “unified multi-national state”. During the Vietnam War, many Nùng fought alongside the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).

In 1954, several thousand Nùng Phàn Slình came to South Vietnam as refugees and settled in Lâm Đồng Province

===Nationalism===

During the Vietnam War, Nùng villages in the Việt Bắc region received very little damage and avoided the devastation of upland communities in the Central Highlands. Although the Democratic Republic of Vietnam supervised state-sponsored migration to upland areas, the north did not experience a massive influx of Kinh Viets, so the ethnic balance around the Nùng Trí Cao temples remained fairly consistent. However the Viet Bac Autonomous Zone in which the Nùng and Tày were most numerous was revoked by Lê Duẩn and the government pursued a policy of forced assimilation of minorities into Vietnamese culture. All education was conducted in the Vietnamese language, traditional customs were discouraged or outlawed, and minority people were moved from their villages into government settlements. At the same time the government created &quot;“New Economic Zones”&quot; along the Chinese border and in the Central Highlands. Frequently this involved taking the best land in order to resettle thousands of people from the overcrowded lowlands. As tension arose between Vietnam and China in 1975, Hanoi feared the loyalty of the Nùng and the Chinese-Vietnamese. After the Sino-Vietnamese War, support for Nùng Trí Cao could be read as anti-Chinese, as he was mainly seen as a rebel against Chinese authority. Even so, during the 1980s, an estimated 250,000 ethnic Vietnamese were settled in the mountainous regions along the Chinese border, leading to a shortage of food in the region and much suffering.

Five temples dedicated to Nùng Trí Cao remained active into the 20th century. The keepers of the Kỳ Sầm Temple all bear the surname Nùng. Although a Romanized script has been created for the Nùng language, worshipers of the temple prefer Chinese, similar to the Zhuang in China, and sometimes Vietnamese. In the 1990s, the &quot;Doi Moi program&quot; shifted the policy of ethnic affairs towards liberalization and preservation. Part of this was the appeal of creating tourist attractions and revenue. The Kỳ Sầm Temple was renovated sometime prior to 2001 to portray a more nationalistic image. The exterior and interior pillars of the temple have been retouched and the Chinese-character inscriptions at the front and Quốc ngữ inscriptions on the walls have been removed. References to &quot;King Nùng&quot; who had &quot;raised high the banner proclaiming independence&quot; have been replaced with floral patterns and pictures of horses, generic symbols associated with local heroes. A large sign indicates the temple as a historical landmark.

==Culture==
===Economy===
When the Nùng moved into Vietnam from Guangxi during the 12th and 13th centuries, they developed slash-and-burn agriculture and worked on terraced hillsides, tending rice paddies and using water wheels for irrigation. The Nùng engage in similar forms of agriculture today, using their gardens to grow a variety of vegetables, corn, peanuts, and fruits such as tangerines, persimmons, anise and other spices, and bamboo as cash crops. Nùng material culture is similar to other highlanders. They live on higher elevation with houses built with clay on stilts near rivers to avoid flooding. Like the Tày, they are known for silversmithing, weaving, basketry, papermaking, and embroidery. Indigo, which represents faithfulness, is a popular choice of color for clothing. Typical motifs for embroidery are the sun, flowers, and stars.

===Customs===
Nùng society is patrilineal and grouped into clans denoted by the region in China they came from. In the past, men could marry outside the clan but women could marry only within the clan, however this practice has declined in the present day. Men could have multiple wives.

===Language===
The Nùng language is part of the Tai language family. Both the Nùng and Tay people used Sawndip script, also known as the Old Zhuang Script, to represent their language, which is closely related to the Zhuang language. Sawndip is a writing system based on Chinese characters to represent their language. In Vietnam, the Tay and Nùng people can no longer read Chinese and write the pronunciation of the characters next to them in the Vietnamese alphabet for their ritual manuscripts.

===Religion===
Many Nùng practice an indigenous religion with animistic, totemic and shamanic features similarly to other Tai ethnic groups. In addition, Nùng religious practices are heavily influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism. The Nùng worship Quan Âm (Guanyin) as the goddess of compassion and kindness.

Local religious services are led by a village shaman who oversees animal sacrifices and communication with the spiritual world. Nature spirits are known as the &quot;phi&quot; in Nùng cosmology. Ancestor worship is also practiced.

<text>Katsina is a Local Government Area and the capital city of Katsina State, in northern Nigeria.

Located some east of the city of Sokoto and northwest of Kano, close to the border with Niger Republic, in 2016, Katsina&#x27;s population was estimated at 429,000.

The city is the centre of an agricultural region noted for production of groundnuts, cotton, hides, millet and guinea corn and also has mills for producing peanut oil and steel. It was also a center for large scale livestock farming of cows, goats, sheep and chickens.

The city has a largely Muslim population, mainly from the Hausa and Fulani ethnic groups.

== History ==

Surrounded by city wall in length, Katsina is believed to have been founded circa 1100. In pre-Islamic times, Katsina&#x27;s semi-divine ruler was known as the &quot;Sarki&quot;, who faced a summary death-sentence if found to be ruling incompetently. From the 17th to the 18th century, Katsina was the commercial heart of Hausaland and became the largest of the seven Hausa city-states. Katsina was conquered by the Fulani during the Fulani War in 1807. In 1903, the Emir, Abubakar dan Ibrahim, accepted British rule, which continued until Nigerian independence from Britain in 1960.

The city&#x27;s history of western-style education dates back to the early 1950s, when the first middle school in northern Nigeria was established (Katsina Teachers College). There are now several institutions of higher learning, including two universities: Umaru Musa Yar&#x27;adua University and the private Alqalam University, a polytechnic Hassan Usman Katsina Polytechnic and a Federal College of Education, Katsina. The city of Katsina is also home to an 18th-century mosque featuring the Gobarau Minaret, a tower made from mud and palm branches.

=== Katsina Emirate ===
The Katsina Royal Palace, known as Gidan Korau, is a huge complex located in the centre of the ancient city. It is a symbol of culture, history and traditions of &#x27;Katsinawa&#x27;. According to historical account, it was built in 1348 CE by Muhammadu Korau, who is believed to have been the first Muslim King of Katsina. This explains why it is traditionally known as &#x27;Gidan Korau&#x27; (House of Korau). It is one of the oldest and among the first generation palaces, along with Daura, Kano and Zazzau. The palace was encircled with a rampart, &#x27;Ganuwar Gidan Sarki&#x27; (which is now gone). The main gate which leads to the palace is known as &#x27;Kofar Soro&#x27;, while the gate at the backyard is called &#x27;Kofar Bai&#x27; (now gone). The Emir&#x27;s residential quarters at the epicenter of the Palace is a large compound built in the typical traditional architectural style.

<doc id="612430" wikidata="Q4947521" url="?curid=612430" title="Boss Radio">
<text>Boss Radio was the name of two radio programming formats, both launched in the early 1960s: One in the United States, and one in the United Kingdom. Although the names were the same, the formats were quite different.

The word &quot;boss&quot; was early 1960s American slang for something fashionably attractive or impressive.

==Boss Radio in the United States==

Although developed earlier at other stations, the U.S. &quot;Boss Radio&quot; format is most closely associated with KHJ in Los Angeles, at 930 kHz AM.

KHJ, one of the first radio stations in Los Angeles, had gone on the air in 1922 and in later years was owned by RKO, a major U.S. corporation which produced movies, television and radio programming over its own stations. In the 1940s and 1950s, KHJ broadcast a mix of drama, mystery, soap operas, news, and music, both live and recorded. In the early 1960s the format was adult contemporary music. The audience ratings were dominated by KFWB, KRLA, KABC and KMPC, and KHJ lagged far behind the other stations.

Block programming gave way to Top 40 radio during the 1950s. Stations played from 40 to 75 current records each week. Disc jockeys were talkative and the jingles were often a full minute in length. Two California radio programming pioneers, Bill Drake and Gene Chenault, modified the Top 40 formula to include a smaller number of records, heavier rotation of the biggest hits, very short jingles and less talk. The new sound would come to be known as &quot;Boss Radio&quot;. KHJ General Manager Ken DeVaney originated the phrase. The word &quot;boss&quot; had come to mean something hip, new, exciting and the top of its class. Drake had tested some of the format elements in 1961 and 1962 while he served as program director and morning man at San Francisco&#x27;s KYA, a station that promoted itself at the time as &quot;The Boss of the Bay&quot;. At about the same time, competitor station KEWB promoted itself via its station ID jingles as &quot;Boss Radio&quot;.

Drake and Chenault introduced and further developed this format at KYNO in Fresno, KSTN in Stockton, and KGB AM in San Diego. In April 1965 they brought it to KHJ.

Within a few months the &quot;Boss Radio&quot; format had brought KHJ to the top of the ratings in the Los Angeles market. It also firmly established the careers of several &quot;boss jocks&quot; such as The Real Don Steele and Robert W. Morgan who helped to put &quot;Boss Radio&quot; on the air in Los Angeles, under the guidance of program director Ron Jacobs. (The other original Boss Jocks in the spring of 1965 included Roger Christian, Gary Mack, Dave Diamond, Sam Riddle, and Johnny Williams.)

As a result of the station&#x27;s success, several other stations adopted the format, notably KFRC in San Francisco, WFIL in Philadelphia, WRKO in Boston, and eventually reaching as far north as Canadian border blaster CKLW in Windsor, Ontario (targeting metro Detroit area). As a result of its powerful 50,000-watt signal and overnight signal propagation, CKLW was able to garner an international audience—even as far as Soviet Russia, making it almost certainly (though unprovably) the biggest of the &quot;Boss Radios&quot;.

==Swinging Radio England==

Swinging Radio England or &quot;SRE&quot; was the &quot;home of the boss jocks and much more music&quot;. The radio station began life in the spring of 1966 on board the former US Army/Navy Vessel USS Deal (FS-263, AKL-2, AG-131) &quot;MV Olga Patricia&quot;, renamed the &quot;Laissez Faire&quot;. The ship was anchored three and a half miles off the Frinton-on-Sea, Essex coast of Britain in international waters.

SRE&#x27;s format was not so much a format as a hybrid of formats. The station was totally unlike any other radio station that had previously been heard in Europe or probably anywhere else in the world at that time. While the PAMS jingles were a resung version of those heard on WABC in New York City and many other stations throughout the States, SRE had a custom melody line unused anywhere else in the world, the high-power &quot;bannerline&quot; news presentation had been lifted from WFUN in Miami, Florida and the DJs were using the heavy echo and the forced approach of stations such as KBOX in Dallas, Texas.

The U.S. &quot;boss jocks&quot; who came over with the ship trained the few English air personnel how to develop this same style of presentation. Everything was &quot;over the top&quot; when it came to the 50 kilowatt transmissions of SRE. While some listeners loved it, most remained tuned to the more relaxed top 40 formats of its competitors such as Wonderful Radio London and Radio Caroline South.

Swinging Radio England shared the ship from which it broadcast with another 50 kW station named Britain Radio, a beautiful music format station which called itself the &quot;Hallmark of Quality&quot;. These two 50 kW stations attempted to broadcast at full power by using caged antennas slung from a central broadcasting mast, which caused constant headaches for the radio engineers. Because of the difficulty in getting the two stations to stay on the air, much early investment money was squandered. Other problems also arose when the British government announced that it would introduce legislation to close all of the offshore stations.

Because of the technical difficulties and the slow start, compounded by a lack of advertising, SRE was forced to sign off the air during November 1966 in a cloud of adverse publicity surrounding its London based advertising sales arm which went out of business in a hailstorm of debt.

<text>International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is a set of U.S. Department of State regulations that control the export of defense and military technologies to safeguard national security and further its foreign policy objectives.

== Overview ==
The United States government has adopted two types of regulations to control exports of military-relevant items: ITAR, which cover weapons and defense articles specifically (such as missiles); and the Export Administration Regulations, which cover items that may have uses in defense articles (such as a radar component used in a certain missile).

Defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions List (USML) are covered by the ITAR, which implement the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), and are described in Title 22 (Foreign Relations), Chapter I (Department of State), Subchapter M of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Department of State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) interprets and enforces ITAR. The related Export Administration Regulations (Code of Federal Regulations Title 15 chapter VII, subchapter C) are enforced and interpreted by the Bureau of Industry and Security in the Commerce Department. The Department of Defense is also involved in the review and approval process. Physical enforcement of the ITAR (as well as all import and export laws of the United States) is performed by Homeland Security Investigations Special Agents (formerly U.S. Customs) under Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security.

For practical purposes, ITAR regulations dictate that information and material pertaining to defense and military-related technologies (items listed on the U.S. Munitions List) may only be shared with US persons unless authorization from the Department of State is received to &quot;export&quot; the material or information to a foreign person. US persons (including organizations; see legal personality) can face heavy fines if they have, without authorization or the use of an exemption, provided foreign persons with access to ITAR-protected defense articles, services or technical data.

The U.S. Munitions List changes over time. Until 1996–1997, ITAR classified strong cryptography as arms and prohibited their export from the U.S. Another change occurred as a result of Space Systems/Loral&#x27;s conduct after the February 1996 failed launch of the Intelsat 708 satellite. The Department of State charged Space Systems/Loral with violating the Arms Export Control Act and the ITAR.

ITAR does not apply to information related to general scientific, mathematical or engineering principles that are commonly taught in schools and colleges or information that is in the public domain. Nor does it apply to general marketing information or basic system descriptions. Broad interpretations of these exceptions have faced several legal challenges. For example, college professors have been prosecuted for breaches of the AECA as a result of access to USML items by foreign graduate students and companies have been penalized for alleged breaches of the AECA for failing to properly remove USML items from material used to market defense articles. The U.S. government has also taken action (albeit unsuccessfully) for the export of technical data that was allegedly already publicly available on the Internet.

== History ==
The AECA and ITAR were enacted in 1976 during the Cold War with the USSR and were intended to implement unilateral arms export controls that reflected those imposed on Eastern Bloc countries by the multilateral Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls.

U.S. Government enforcement activities have increased dramatically since 1999, when the U.S. Department of State took over export regulations for satellites. The U.S. Department of State has published 29 instances of Consent Agreements (agreements entered into by parties charged with breaches of ITAR) since 1999. This compares to 12 Consent Agreements in the preceding 22 years. ITAR&#x27;s prominence has also increased as its implications for foreign parties that handle USML items have become better understood (see &quot;Controversy&quot; below).

ITAR&#x27;s impact of increased regulations also meant America&#x27;s worldwide market share in satellite technology declined from 83 percent to 50 percent in 2008, states The Economist, which cited a report from Space Review. In early 2013 legislation was passed allowing the removal of satellite technology from ITAR regulation.

== Operation ==

=== Classification of defense articles ===
The ITAR regulate defense articles and defense services.

Defense articles can be broken down into two categories: (a) physical items (often referred to as &quot;commodities&quot;) and (b) technical data. The ITAR contain a list of defense articles called the US Munitions List (&quot;USML&quot;), which can be found at 22 CFR §121.1. The USML is broken down into the following categories:I: Firearms, close assault weapons and combat shotguns

II: Guns and armament

III: Ammunition/ordnance

IV: Launch vehicles, Guided missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs and mines

V: Explosives and energetic materials, propellants, incendiary agents and their constituents

VI: Surface vessels of war and special naval equipment

VII: Tanks and military vehicles

VIII: Aircraft and associated equipment

IX: Military training equipment

X: Personal Protective Equipment

XI: Military electronics

XII: Fire control, range finders, optical and guidance and control equipment

XIII: Materials and miscellaneous equipment

XIV: Toxicological agents, including chemical agents, biological agents, and associated equipment

XV: Spacecraft and associated equipment

XVI: Nuclear weapons related articles

XVII: Classified articles, technical data and defense services not otherwise enumerated

XVIII: Directed energy weapons

XIX: Gas turbine engines and associated equipment

XX: Submersible vessels, oceanographic and related articles

XXI: Articles, technical data, and defense services not otherwise enumeratedFor example, an M4 carbine, which is an assault rifle used by the U.S. military, would be identified under Category I paragraph (b):*(b) Fully automatic firearms to .50 caliber inclusive (12.7 mm).A flash suppressor for the M4 rifle then follows in paragraph (e):*(e) Silencers, mufflers, sound and flash suppressors for the articles in (a) through (d) of this category and their specifically designed, modified or adapted components and parts.Components, parts, and accessories for the M4 are in paragraph (h):(h) Components, parts, accessories and attachments for the articles in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this category.Finally, technical data and defense services relating to the M4 are in paragraph (i):(i) Technical data (as defined in §120.33 of this subchapter) and defense services (as defined in §120.32 of this subchapter) directly related to the defense articles described in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this category. Technical data directly related to the manufacture or production of any defense articles described elsewhere in this category that are designated as Significant Military Equipment (SME) shall itself be designated SME.Technical data is defined in the ITAR at 22 CFR §120.33 as:(1) Information, other than software as defined in &quot;22 CFR&quot; §120.40(g), which is required for the design, development, production, manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance or modification of defense articles. This includes information in the form of blueprints, drawings, photographs, plans, instructions or documentation.

(2) Classified information relating to defense articles and defense services on the U.S. Munitions List and 600-series items controlled by the Commerce Control List;

(3) Information covered by an invention secrecy order; or

(4) Software (&quot;see 22 CFR&quot; §120.40(g)) directly related to defense articles.

=== Registration ===
All U.S. manufacturers, exporters, and brokers of defense articles, defense services, or related technical data, as defined on the USML, are required to register with U.S. Department of State. Registration is primarily a means to provide the U.S. Government with necessary information on who is involved in certain manufacturing and exporting activities. Registration does not confer any export rights or privileges, but is a precondition for the issuance of any license or other approval for export. Registration fees start at US$2,250 per year.

=== Exporting defense articles ===
Under ITAR, a &quot;US person&quot; who wants to export USML items to a &quot;foreign person&quot; must obtain authorization from the U.S. Department of State before the export can take place.

A &quot;U.S. person&quot; can be
* a U.S. citizen;
* a permanent resident who does not work for a foreign company, a foreign government, or a foreign governmental agency/organization;
* a political asylee;
* a part of the U.S. government, or
* a corporation, business, organization, or group that is incorporated in the United States under U.S. law.

A foreign person is any person who is not a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. and includes foreign governments and organizations. This means that, for example, a foreign person who is visiting the U.S. will remain a foreign person for the purposes of ITAR and any export of USML items to them inside the U.S. must be subject to an export authorization. This is similar to the concept of &quot;Deemed Exports&quot; used by the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce in administration of the Export Administration Regulations although the Department of State does not use the term &quot;Deemed Export&quot; (see also &quot;Restrictions on Dual and Third Country Nationals below&quot;).

The export authorization may take the form of:
* a Foreign Military Sales (&quot;FMS&quot;) Case whereby the U.S. Government sells the USML items directly to a foreign government;
* an export license, such as a DSP-5 (Department of State Publication No. 5), which authorizes the temporary or permanent export of defense articles and/or technical data to a foreign person (but not technical assistance or defense services);
* a Warehouse and Distribution Agreement which is an agreement to establish a warehouse or distribution point abroad for defense articles to be exported from the United States for subsequent distribution to entities in an approved sales territory;
* a Technical Assistance Agreement (&quot;TAA&quot;) which authorizes a U.S. manufacturer/service provider to supply defense services to a foreign person (which could involve training or technical discussions regarding U.S. technology); or
* a Manufacturing License Agreement (&quot;MLA&quot;) which authorises a U.S. manufacturer to supply manufacturing know-how related to defense articles to a foreign person.

Where the export authorization relates to USML items that are classified information or are identified as &quot;Significant Military Equipment&quot; on the USML, a DSP-83 Nontransfer and Use Certificate will also be required.

Collaborative programs (also known as &quot;Armaments Cooperative Projects&quot; (&quot;ACPs&quot;)) between the U.S. and foreign Governments (such as the Joint Strike Fighter) may also authorize export of USML items (subject to strict controls).

== Restrictions on retransfer ==
ITAR also operates to prohibit the &quot;retransfer&quot; (also called &quot;re-export&quot;) of items on the USML by foreign persons unless the retransfer is specifically authorized under the relevant export authorization.

The prohibition on retransfer stems from the requirement for all export authorizations to include the statement that &quot;[t]he technical data or defense service exported from the United States in furtherance of this agreement and any defense article which may be produced or manufactured from such technical data or defense service may not be transferred to a person in a third country or to a national of a third country except as specifically authorized in this agreement unless the prior written approval of the Department of State has been obtained.&quot;

This means that if, for example, a foreign person wants to retransfer a USML item to another foreign person (such as a subcontractor), both foreign persons must be authorized under the relevant export authorization:
* where the export authorization is a FMS case, the foreign government must have &quot;third party transfer approval&quot; from the U.S. Government;
* if the export authorization is an export license such as a DSP-5, all foreign parties must be named on the license (for example, some may be &quot;intermediate consignees&quot;); and
* where the export authorization is a TAA or MLA, all foreign recipients must be named as parties to (or as &quot;authorized sublicensees&quot; under) the agreement.

Where a foreign person requires access to USML items exported under a specific export authorization, but that foreign person is not authorized under the export authorization, the export authorization must be amended and re-approved by the U.S. Department of State. This can be a time-consuming process.

== Restrictions on retransfer to dual nationals and third country nationals ==
ITAR treats access to USML items by &quot;dual-national&quot; and &quot;third country national&quot; employees of a foreign organization as a retransfer to the employees&#x27; other countries of nationality. As a result, access to USML items by such employees must be specifically authorized under the relevant export authorization. If access to USML items by dual and third country national employees of a foreign organization is authorized, it only authorizes transfer to the employee. It does not authorize export to the employee&#x27;s country of dual or third nationality.

If a U.S. export authorization is silent as to access by dual and third country national employees of a foreign party, the authorization has the effect of limiting access to employees who are nationals only of the country of their employer. This means that, for example, a TAA that includes a British company as the foreign person, but which does not include clauses authorizing access by dual and third country nationals will limit access to USML items supplied under the TAA to employees of the British company who are British citizens only.

This can cause significant problems for foreign governments and organizations from countries with large first generation immigrant populations (which is discussed in more detail under &quot;Controversy&quot;). As a result, the U.S. Government and the Australian Government have drawn attention to the importance for U.S. companies to consult closely with foreign persons who will be subject to a U.S. export authorization before it is submitted to the U.S. Department of State for approval.

Clauses approved by the U.S. Department of State must be included in TAAs and MLAs in order to authorize access to USML items by dual and third country national employees of foreign parties to the export authorization. These clauses will generally permit access by dual and third country nationals from NATO, EU, Japan, Switzerland, New Zealand and Australia (subject to certain conditions). Employees of foreign persons holding dual or third country nationality from countries proscribed under ITAR 126.1, such as Vietnam, The People&#x27;s Republic of China (&quot;PRC&quot;), North Korea, Syria, and Iran, will, as a general rule, not be authorized to have access to USML items. It is less-clear how dual and third country nationals are addressed in FMS cases and export licenses such as DSP-5s.

== Enforcement ==
The U.S. Government has substantially increased action against organizations and individuals responsible for breaches of ITAR since 1999. The most notable enforcement action was the $100M penalty applied to ITT as a result of the unauthorized retransfer of night vision technology to the PRC in 2007. Other major U.S. defense contractors penalized for alleged breaches of ITAR in recent years include (among others) Lockheed Martin, Motorola, Boeing, L-3 Communications, and Northrop Grumman.

In most cases, penalties against corporate entities involve a mandatory compliance component requiring the entity to spend funds on compliance measures, including the appointment of &quot;Internal Special Compliance Officers&quot;. Penalties may also require the party to submit to external audit. In serious cases, a party may be debarred from future exporting for a period of time.

U.S. Government policy also imposes a positive obligation on U.S. companies to fully disclose any breaches of ITAR to the U.S. Government. Failure to do so can significantly increase penalties applied by the U.S. Government.

The U.S. Government:
* will also penalize U.S. companies for breaches of ITAR caused by their overseas subsidiaries;
* is critical of companies that have not implemented effective export compliance programs; and
* treats breaches of ITAR as a strict liability offence and will penalize a successor or purchaser of a company that has breached ITAR as though it was responsible for the breaches.

The U.S. Government will also take action against individuals responsible for breaches of ITAR and such action can involve criminal penalties. Actions are often initiated by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and include:
* the prosecution of Dr J Reece Roth of the University of Tennessee in 2008 for breaches of ITAR as a result of access to USML items by a PRC graduate student;
* the prosecution of Yen Ching Peng, a Taiwanese national, in the U.S. in 2008 for breaches of ITAR as a result of attempts to export night vision technology and laser sights without the appropriate export authorizations;
* the indictment of three men — two U.S. nationals and a Vietnamese national — in 2008 on charges of illegally exporting night vision technology to Vietnam; and
* the prosecution of Chi Mak in 2007 as a result of (among other things) the attempted export of USML items to the PRC (Chi Mak was subsequently sentenced to 24½ years in federal prison).

Since 1990, the U.S. Government has also operated the &quot;Blue Lantern&quot; end-use monitoring program. Blue Lantern &quot;monitors the end-use of commercially exported defense articles, defense services, and related technical data subject to licensing or other authorizations under section 38 of the AECA.&quot; Blue Lantern checks are conducted following a careful selection process to identify transactions that appear most at risk for diversion or misuse. Unfavorable Blue Lanterns are reviewed by DTCC&#x27;s Enforcement Division. Where appropriate, parties involved in unfavorable Blue Lantern cases may be subject to civil enforcement actions or referred to law enforcement for criminal investigation.

== Compliance ==
Because failure to implement an effective export compliance program can be an exacerbating factor in the event of a breach of ITAR, the U.S. Government encourages U.S. exporters to implement internal export compliance programs. The U.S. Government may also require U.S. exporters that are party to an export authorization to develop a technology transfer control plan specific to that export authorization.

Other countries also encourage their nationals who are using USML items to implement internal export compliance programs to address ITAR requirements. It is notable that the failure of overseas companies to implement ITAR compliance programs has been criticized by the U.S. Department of State.

Companies in U.S. and overseas are increasingly using the ERP software to track the ITAR controlled items through the supply chain.

== ITAR reform ==
While political debate over the wisdom of placing all satellite and launch technology on the US Munitions List (USML) has been ongoing since the advent of ITAR regulation in 1999, there has been a shift in political opinion since 2007. In late 2012, the US Congress passed the 2013 defense authorization bill which, if signed into law, will allow U.S. satellite manufacturers to &quot;be more able to collaborate with international partners and [place] U.S. component makers on a more even footing in the global marketplace.&quot; The bill &quot;allows the president to remove commercial satellites and components from the U.S. Munitions List (USML) and allows him to decide which satellite technologies are the most important to protect. The bill still restricts the export and transfer of technology to China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.&quot;

The political changes in 2012 came after several years of a gradual shift in thinking. In 2010, the Congress formally requested &quot;an assessment of the national security risks of removing satellites and components from the USML. The study, known as the &quot;1248 report&quot;, was completed in April 2012.

While satellite technology had been subjected to ITAR since 1999, the U.S. had seen its share of global satellite manufacturing halved with, according to the Aerospace Industries Association, an estimated loss of $21 billion in revenue from 1999 to 2009.

As part of the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the U.S. Congress included a partial exemption from ITAR for the U.K. and Australia as long as their export controls laws were comparable to the U.S&#x27;s. On August 15, 2024, the State Department determined that export control regimes of Australia and the U.K. were comparable to the U.S&#x27;s which will allow for license-free trade for more than 70% of items covered by ITAR between the three AUKUS countries from September 1, 2024.

== Controversy ==

=== Harm to U.S. commercial and academic interests ===

There is an open debate between the Department of State and the industries and academia regulated by ITAR concerning how harmful the regulatory restrictions are for U.S.-domiciled businesses and higher education institutions.

==== Academic work and the &quot;Fundamental Research Exemption&quot; ====

Higher education institutions argue that ITAR prevents the best international students from studying and contributing in the United States, and prevents cooperation on certain types of international scientific projects. ITAR generally prohibits foreign persons from collaborating with US citizens on projects pertaining to items on the USML without export licensing, as such work can be construed to fall under one of the several enumerated definitions of &quot;export,&quot; such as:
* &quot;Disclosing (including oral or visual disclosure) or transferring technical data to a foreign person&quot;
* &quot;Performing a defense service on behalf of, or for the benefit of, a foreign person, whether in the United States or abroad&quot;
Where the definition of &quot;defense service&quot; includes &quot;the furnishing of assistance (including training) to foreign persons, whether in the United States or abroad in the design, development, engineering, manufacture, production, assembly, testing, repair, maintenance, modification, operation, demilitarization, destruction, processing or use of defense articles.&quot;

The ITAR specifies that the products of &quot;fundamental research&quot; are not considered controlled &quot;technical data,&quot; so long as they are published freely. Fundamental research is defined as university-based &quot;basic and applied research in science and engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from research the results of which are restricted for proprietary reasons or specific U.S. Government access and dissemination controls.&quot;

Research that does not meet the criteria of &quot;fundamental research&quot; cannot involve foreign persons without export licenses; however, research activities that are considered fundamental typically can involve foreign persons, even when they involve the design and construction of defense articles, as the US State Department has deemed such research activities to fall outside of the purview of training activities that would constitute the illegal export of a &quot;defense service.&quot; The need to make this distinction has led many U.S. research universities to adopt ITAR policies and compliance programs. These measures can vary widely; for example, MIT states that &quot;the intent of the ITAR is that research conducted on campus, without restrictions on publication or participation, is fundamental research from inception to publication as long as the intent is to publish the results,&quot; while Stanford University maintains a more nuanced and restrictive approach to research involving defense articles.

University interpretation and up-to-date understanding of export control regulations and willingness to seek opinions from the U.S. State Department affect the research that can be conducted on their campuses; for example, the University of Michigan successfully obtained an opinion from the Department of State stating that satellite development work on an (at the time) ITAR-controlled satellite being conducted by a student group containing both U.S. and non-U.S. citizens was considered fundamental research and was allowed to proceed. In contrast, as of March 2016, Stanford&#x27;s Export Control Officer maintains that all satellite systems are controlled defense articles under the ITAR (despite their reclassification under the EAR in 2014) and, based on NASA criteria for &quot;automatic&quot; designation of a research project as fundamental research, does not consider projects above TRL 4 to be fundamental research, limiting the activities of laboratories and project-based groups on campus. This and similar policies are particularly damaging to international students studying aerospace engineering or related fields at U.S. universities, as opportunities to gain practical experience in their studies through internships are, due to licensing requirements, typically not offered to them at U.S. aerospace companies, and on-campus projects, when allowed, offer an alternate route for developing skills like those obtained through internships and co-op programs.

==== Effects on the U.S. space industry ====

The Department of State insists that ITAR has limited effect and provides a security benefit to the nation that outweighs any impact that these sectors must bear. Every year, the Department of State can cite multiple arrests of ITAR violators by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and the FBI. It is apparent that companies and institutions within the affected areas are somewhat stifled by ITAR regulations, in addition to the trade the U.S. economy would receive, and the science technology that it would share, notwithstanding that its restrictions encourage U.S. allies (such as Australia and the UK) to procure defense equipment from other sources that may not be interoperable with U.S. equipment. Companies argue that ITAR is a significant trade barrier that acts as a substantial negative subsidy, weakening U.S. industries&#x27; ability to compete. U.S. companies point to announcements in Europe by TAS (Thales Alenia Space) promoting their &quot;ITAR-free&quot; telecommunication satellites.
In 2008, officials at the Department of State dismissed the burden on industry and educational institutions as minor compared to the contributions to national security provided by ITAR. They also view the announcements of &quot;ITAR-free&quot; items as anecdotal and not systemic.

There is evidence that ITAR considerations have been a factor in decisions by foreign governments to avoid U.S. products and decisions by U.S. companies to remove USML items from their products:
* In April 2006, the Australian Government was reported to have chosen EADS MRH-90 troop-lift helicopters in preference to U.S. Sikorsky models because &quot;the European bid offered the ADF better access to crucial computer source code than the Sikorsky bid&quot;.
* ITAR controls, as well as separate policy concerns, have hampered international cooperation in development of the F-35 Lightning II multirole fighter aircraft. Both the British and the Australian governments demanded a guarantee that the U.S. will fully disclose technology needed for the JSF project before they would commit to further involvement in the project.
* Concerns over connections between the Boeing 787 and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber prompted Boeing to take elaborate steps cleansing the commercial jet of any military technology. The issue arose when Boeing engineers, fearing indictment and penalties, refused to sign forms declaring that the 787 was &quot;ITAR-free.&quot; As a result, Boeing conducted extensive research on the source of technology implemented on the 787. They removed all military technology and either found a commercial source for the same technology or replaced it with technology derived from non-military sources.
* For the F-X2 program, the Brazilian government considered the French Dassault Rafale over the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet due to concerns over technology transfer barriers and ITAR regulations, regardless that the Brazilian Air Force and the majority of their pilots preferred the Super Hornet over other bidders. Nelson Jobim, Defense minister of Brazil, said: &quot;the U.S. government could give no upfront guarantee and Brazil had seen a series of U.S. technology embargoes.&quot; The lucrative contract was for 36 aircraft and will be extended to over 100 units in the next decade. In December 2013, it was announced that the Swedish Saab JAS 39 Gripen was selected, in a deal worth about $4.5 billion; Saab guaranteed the transfer of “all systems” as part of the deal, including software to ensure the Brazilian Air Force had the capability to customize the technology — and air force general Juniti Saito stated “the intellectual property of this new fighter will be ours”.

=== Registration fees ===
The U.S. Department of State charges back fees to manufacturers who have failed to register previously. Smaller exporters who may not have been aware of the requirement to register can potentially be charged crippling back fees when they first register. Allegations have been put to the U.S. Department of State-industry advisory group, the Defense Trade Advisory Group, that charging back fees discourages some manufacturers from registration.

=== Restrictions on foreign products ===
Restrictions on retransfer of USML items can also cause difficulties where those items have been incorporated into a product manufactured by a foreign person. If the foreign person wants to retransfer the product to another foreign person, it must obtain authorization from the U.S. Government before the retransfer can take place.

It is open to the U.S. Government to refuse to authorize retransfer of a foreign product that includes USML items:
* in 2006, the U.S. Government refused to authorize the sale of C-295 transport and maritime patrol aircraft manufactured by the Spanish aircraft manufacturer, EADS-CASA, to Venezuela because the aircraft included US-origin avionics and engine components controlled under the USML. As a consequence, EADS-CASA was forced to cancel a €500 million contract with Venezuela; and
* in 2006, Embraer of Brazil was also prevented from selling Super Tucano aircraft to Venezuela by the U.S.
As a consequence of the blocking of these sales, Venezuela has subsequently purchased aircraft and other military hardware from Russia and Belarus.
* In 2010 the will be using as much non-American equipment as possible, including technology from Canada, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel. The ITAR have also been blamed for the delay of the CH-148 Cyclone which is currently two years behind the original schedule.
* In 2010 the Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter was faced with delays and restrictions. The first 19 of the 28 CH-148 Cyclones will be delivered in an interim standard which does not meet the original contract requirements.

=== Restrictions on dual and third country nationals ===
The restrictions on access to USML items by dual and third country national employees of a foreign person can cause significant difficulties because the current accepted definitions of dual and third country nationals do not reflect the definition of &quot;US persons&quot;. The Department of State defines dual and third country nationality as follows:
* Third country national: an individual holding nationality from a country or countries other than the country of the foreign signatory to the agreement; and
* Dual national: holds nationality from the country of a foreign signatory and one or more additional foreign countries.

Although &quot;nationality&quot; is not defined under ITAR, it is accepted that the U.S. Government will take country of origin and continued ties or allegiance to a country into account when determining dual or third country nationality.

This means that a person who was born in the UK but is a U.S. permanent resident working in the U.S. for a U.S. company will be considered a U.S. person only (under the definition of &quot;US person&quot;). If, however, the same person emigrated to Canada, obtained Canadian citizenship and commenced employment with a Canadian company, she would be treated as a Canadian-British dual national for the purposes of any U.S. export authorization to which her employer was a party. If she did not obtain Canadian citizenship but instead became a temporary or permanent Canadian resident, she would be treated as a British third country national for the purposes of such U.S. export authorization.

It is also possible for a person who was born in one country to become a dual national for the purposes of ITAR without necessarily leaving his country of origin, simply by obtaining a foreign passport (thereby &quot;holding nationality&quot; from another country). This is frequently the case where the individual&#x27;s parent/s were born in a country that grants citizenship to children of its citizens, regardless of where the children were born, for example, a child born in Canada to parents who were born in the UK is able to obtain a British passport (see British nationality law). Once he has done so, he becomes a Canadian-British dual national for the purposes of ITAR.

Restrictions on access to USML items by dual and third country national employees of foreign persons essentially forces foreign persons to discriminate against their employees who do not meet the nationality criteria under an export authorization. Such discrimination may be illegal in some countries under anti-discrimination law (such as in Canada and Australia).

In addition, the prohibition on access by dual and third country nationals from countries proscribed under ITAR 126.1 can cause problems for countries with large immigrant populations from those countries (such as Canada and Australia, which both have large Overseas Chinese and Overseas Vietnamese immigrant populations: see immigration to Canada and immigration to Australia).

The U.S. Government actively enforces restrictions on access to USML items by dual and third country nationals. Example: General Dynamics Land Systems was fined US$20m in 2004 for breaches of the AECA by its predecessor, GM Defense, that included access to USML items by unauthorized dual nationals. The unauthorized access had included direct access to USML items and access to international computer systems on which USML items were stored by dual nationals from countries including Syria and the PRC.

=== ITAR and information technology ===
The ease with which USML items can be exported and retransferred using computer networks and removable media significantly increases the risk of unauthorized retransfer of USML items. As discussed above, carrying a laptop computer which contains USML items overseas is considered a retransfer of those items. Likewise, access to USML items on corporate systems, such as intranets, by foreign persons overseas or in the U.S., is considered a Retransfer of the items. Foreign employees working in the US cannot have access to the same network where ITAR data may be stored, nor may they have access to rooms or facilities where ITAR work is being done.

It is important to note that, in both cases, theoretical access to the USML items overseas or by foreign persons is sufficient to constitute a breach of ITAR. Files on a laptop carried overseas do not need to be opened overseas, and foreign persons do not need to have actual access to USML items on computer networks for a breach to occur.

Theoretical access to USML items by foreign persons (including dual and third country nationals) can create difficulties for the engagement of IT professionals from overseas as network administrators or the use of overseas companies to support IT systems. This also creates significant challenges for manufacturers of ITAR-related items with respect to hiring practices. Avoiding discrimination while screening applicants for their ability to access ITAR materials can often be an HR nightmare.

=== Satellite components ===

Before 1992, satellite components were classified as munitions, and ITAR export compliance was controlled by the State Department. After the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster resulted in a growing backlog of commercial satellite launches, ITAR kept the Soviet Union out of the market. In September 1988, U.S. President Ronald Reagan agreed to allow U.S. satellites to be launched on Chinese rockets. Communications satellites were gradually transferred from the State Department to the Commerce Department in 1992–1996, falling under the Export Administration Regulations.

After the failed launches of Apstar 2 (1995) and Intelsat 708 (1996), both on Chinese rockets, the satellite insurance companies required the satellite manufacturers to work with China to investigate the failures. The Commerce Department determined that the &quot;export&quot; of information as part of the failure analysis complied with the export license. However, the Justice Department maintained that a separate export license was required in addition to the original launch license. In 1998, Congress reclassified satellite technology as a munition and returned it to the control of the State Department under ITAR. Space Systems/Loral paid a $20 million fine in 2002 for Intelsat 708, and Hughes paid a $32 million fine in 2003 for Apstar 2. The ChinaSat 8 satellite, which had been scheduled for launch in April 1999 on a Long March 3B rocket, was placed in storage for a decade and finally launched on an Ariane 5 rocket in 2008.

China used the results of the insurance investigation to improve the reliability of its Long March rockets, which would not experience another mission failure until 2011. ITAR has been blamed for &quot;destroy[ing] an industry,&quot; reducing the market share of U.S. satellite makers by almost 25% from 1997 to 2007. The European company Thales Alenia Space developed a line of ITAR-free satellites that used no restricted U.S. components, allowing them to be launched on Chinese rockets between 2005 and 2012. However, the U.S. Department of State did not accept the ITAR-free status of these satellites and fined the US company Aeroflex $8 million for selling ITAR components. Thales Alenia was forced to discontinue its ITAR-free satellite line in 2013.

In May 2014, the United States Department of State reclassified satellites and several related components so they will no longer be treated as munitions whose export is controlled by ITAR, but will be covered instead under the Export Administration Regulations. Restrictions were loosened on 36 countries, strict controls remained on another 150 countries, and exports remained prohibited to 20 countries. An official at the Bureau of Industry and Security emphasized that &quot;no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it’s incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China&quot;. Thales Alenia had long complained that &quot;every satellite nut and bolt&quot; was being classified as ITAR-restricted, and the European Space Agency accused the United States of having no real interest in protecting U.S. satellite technology.

ITAR remains a major concern in the European aerospace industry as of 2016. The European Space Agency and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency have supplied components that were launched on Chinese rockets. European manufacturers of satellite components report that ITAR-free status is the first question they are asked by potential customers. Even U.S. companies have expressed interest in ITAR-free technology. The Chinese space industry has been able to sell in the global market by bundling Chinese satellites with Chinese rockets, avoiding ITAR.

<doc id="612451" wikidata="Q407918" url="?curid=612451" title="Ethanethiol">
<text>Ethanethiol, commonly known as ethyl mercaptan, is an organosulfur compound with the formula CH3CH2SH. It is a colorless liquid with a distinct odor. Abbreviated EtSH, it consists of an ethyl group (Et), CH3CH2, attached to a thiol group, SH. Its structure parallels that of ethanol, but with sulfur in place of oxygen. The odor of EtSH is infamous. Ethanethiol is more volatile than ethanol due to a diminished ability to engage in hydrogen bonding. Ethanethiol is toxic in high concentrations. It occurs naturally as a minor component of petroleum, and may be added to otherwise odorless gaseous products such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to help warn of gas leaks. At these concentrations, ethanethiol is not harmful.

==Preparation==
Ethanethiol is prepared by the reaction of ethylene with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of various catalysts. It is also prepared commercially by the reaction of ethanol with hydrogen sulfide gas over an acidic solid catalyst, such as alumina.

===Historic methods===
Ethanethiol was originally reported by Zeise in 1834. Zeise treated calcium ethyl sulfate with a suspension of barium sulfide saturated with hydrogen sulfide. He is credited with naming the C2H5S- group as mercaptum.

Ethanethiol can also be prepared by a halide displacement reaction, where ethyl halide is treated with aqueous sodium bisulfide. This conversion was demonstrated as early as 1840 by Henri Victor Regnault.

==Odor==
Ethanethiol has a strongly disagreeable odor that humans can detect in minute concentrations. The threshold for human detection is as low as one part in 2.8 billion parts of air (0.36 parts per billion). Its odor resembles that of leeks, onions, durian or cooked cabbage.

Employees of the Union Oil Company of California reported first in 1938 that turkey vultures would gather at the site of any gas leak. After finding that this was caused by traces of ethanethiol in the gas it was decided to boost the amount of ethanethiol in the gas, to make detection of leaks easier.

==Uses==
Ethanethiol is intentionally added to butane and propane (see: LPG) to impart an easily noticed smell to these normally odorless fuels that pose the threat of fire, explosion, and asphyxiation.

In the underground mining industry, ethanethiol or ethyl mercaptan is referred to as &quot;stench gas&quot;. The gas is released into mine ventilation systems during an emergency to alert mine workers. In Ontario, mining legislation dictates that &quot;The alarm system in an underground mine shall, consist of the introduction into all workplaces of sufficient quantities of ethyl mercaptan gas or similar gas to be readily detectable by all workers&quot;.

==Reactions==

Ethanethiol is a reagent in organic synthesis. In the presence of sodium hydroxide, it gives the powerful nucleophile EtS−. The salt can be generated quantitatively by reaction with sodium hydride.

Ethanethiol can be oxidized to ethyl sulfonic acid, using strong oxidizing agents. Weaker oxidants, such as ferric oxide or hydrogen peroxide give the disulfide, diethyl disulfide:
:2 EtSH + H2O2 → EtS-SEt + 2 H2O
Like other thiols, it behaves comparably to hydrogen sulfide. For example, it binds, concomitant with deprotonation to &quot;soft&quot; transition metal cations, such as Hg2+, Cu+, and Ni2+ to give polymeric thiolato complexes, Hg(SEt)2, CuSEt, and Ni(SEt)2, respectively.

<doc id="612453" wikidata="Q6906086" url="?curid=612453" title="Montmorency, Victoria">
<text>Montmorency ( ) is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Banyule local government area. Montmorency recorded a population of 9,250 at the 2021 census.

Montmorency was named after a local farm, Montmorency Estate, which in turn was named for the town of Montmorency, Val-d&#x27;Oise, where the French Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau lived briefly. Locals of Montmorency often refer to the suburb as &#x27;Monty&#x27;, and the nickname is incorporated into some local business names.

==History==

The first people on the land now known as Montmorency were the Wurundjeri-willam people.

Merchant Stuart Alexander Donaldson (1812–1867), the first Premier of New South Wales, owned the farming property known as &#x27;The Montmorency Estate&#x27; until the 1840s. The first evidence of a township was the building of a Presbyterian church in 1917 in the midst of small rural landholdings. Montmorency Primary School was opened in 1922, the year before Montmorency station was opened on the Hurstbridge railway line. Electricity was connected to the area in 1926. Montmorency Post Office opened around September 1923.

Whilst there was a residential nucleus from the 1920s, most of Montmorency consisted of orchards, dairying, and poultry farms until after the Second World War. The estimated population in 1922 was 200, including weekenders.

In 1950 the estimated population was 600, and facilities extended to two churches, a public hall, a sports ground and a tennis court. By the end of the decade the population had increased fivefold, although still with unoccupied building sites which had fine views. A modern shopping centre and factories had been built.

==Schools==

* Montmorency Primary School
* Montmorency Secondary College – Opened in 1969
* Montmorency South Primary School
* St. Francis Xavier Catholic Primary School – Opened in 1932

==Facilities==

The main commercial street is Were Street. A three-storey high ornamental aeration windmill stands at the corner of Were Street and Rattray Road. The footpaths of Were Street are inlaid with mosaic pictures representing scenes from oral histories of the suburb. This shopping strip is notable for the relatively low proportion of national chain stores and franchises among its businesses.

There is a second business precinct located 1.1 km to the south east of Were Street, on Grand Boulevard, mainly catering to small offices. In Mountain View Road there is an RSL which serves counter meals, a lawn bowls club, and the Montmorency Scout Hall with access to the Petrie Park Oval opposite all of these services.
Montmorency Football Club, an Australian rules football team, competes in the Northern Football League. Its playing field and clubhouse are located at Montmorency Park in the green belt between Para Road and the Plenty River. Lower Plenty Football Club are also in the same league and are also based at Montmorency Park.

Montmorency has hilly parklands adjoining the Plenty River on its western side and several neighbourhood parks, particularly in its south-east sector.

Public library services are provided by Yarra Plenty Regional Library. The nearest libraries are Diamond Valley Library in Greensborough, Watsonia Library and Eltham library.

==Transport==

Montmorency is close to outlying towns and suburbs such as Eltham, Greensborough, Templestowe and Doncaster, for it lies within the main feeder roads to these suburbs. The Box Hill 293, Frankston/Melbourne Airport 901 and Glenroy/Eltham 513/514 bus routes also service the area.

It lies on the Hurstbridge Line, and it takes around 48 minutes to reach Montmorency Station from the CBD of Melbourne.

==Notable people==
* Sharin Anderson - musician, grew up in Montmorency
* Mark Fraser - footballer, born 1971
* Gotye - musician, born 1980
* Peter Helliar - comedian and broadcaster
* Dayyan Eng - film director, lived in Montmorency as a teenager 
* Brett Wood - musician

<text>This article deals with the system of transport in [[Belgrade]], both public and private.

==Urban==
Belgrade has an extensive public transport system, which consists of buses, trams, trolley buses and trains operated by the city-owned GSP Belgrade and several private companies. All companies participate in Integrated Tariff System (ITS), which makes tickets transferable between companies and vehicle types. Tickets can be purchased in numerous kiosks or from the driver. They must be validated inside the vehicle and are valid for one ride only. On February 1, 2012, BusPlus, a modern electronic system for managing vehicles and transportation tickets in public transport was introduced, a system based on a vague contract which does not explicitly state the profit made by Apex Technology Solutions, and the giveaway of advertising space on bus stations. It was replaced by a new payment system called &quot;Beograd plus&quot; in 2023, and the payment systems were entirely discontinued since January 1, 2025, making Belgrade the first capital in Europe to use free public transport.

===Buses===
The main Belgrade Bus Station is located at Železnička 4, which is closed since 29 September 2024, and currently being demolished. It was replaced with a new bus station in New Belgrade.

City public bus transportation is operated by 4 main carriers:
*Gradsko saobraćajno preduzeće Beograd (GSP) – city-owned company
*Saobraćajno preduzeće Lasta
*GP-NP &quot;MobiLitas&quot; (consortium of private transporters). 
*ASP Strela Obrenovac
*Arriva LUV
*Poslovno udruženje Beobus
*Tamnava trans
*Domiko

Excluding electric buses, minibuses and seasonal lines, there are 223 regular lines and 23 night lines. Night lines are 15, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 37, 47, 51, 56, 68, 75, 101, 202, 301, 304, 401, 511, 601, 603, 704, 706.

Night lines that are abolished are: 7, 9, 11, 48, 96, 304, 701. 

Each of the regular lines is operated by GSP and by one of the other carriers. Since November 27 all night routes are operated by GSP Beograd. 

Private carriers were introduced in 1990s after many strikes in GSP, which had the monopoly till then. There were many unsuccessful efforts by the city after 2000 to unify them into the same ticket system. Finally, in 2004 it was agreed that ITS (integrated tariff system) will be introduced. These 6 companies will carry the public transportation till 2012, when the City Government will decide whether GSP is going to remain the only transport company.

====Regular bus lines====

The lines are usually denoted by their number, but sometimes letters are added as a designation. Lines serving the city have numbers up to 100, while lines reaching the suburbs or exclusively serving those are indicated by numbers over 100. Line 95 is the longest line in the city proper: connecting Borča to Block 45, it goes across the Danube via Pančevo Bridge and across the Sava via Branko&#x27;s Bridge. Line 583, which reaches to the village of Trbušnica is the longest in the city&#x27;s metropolitan area. Line 95 is more than 20 kilometres long, while line 583 stretches on for 73 kilometres. In contrast, line 66 is the shortest one, at just 700 metres.

====Electric buses====
There are two electric &quot;EKO&quot; bus lines in Belgrade, served by vehicles produced together by the Israeli-Bulgarian Chariot Motors and Chinese Higer Bus Company and Aowei Technology. Those are painted with a distinctive green color and are recharged in 10 minutes at the termini. The first buses entered service on 1 September 2016. 
* EKO 1 – Vukov spomenik – Naselje Belville. It was the first electric bus line introduced, crossing the Sava River via Branko&#x27;s Bridge. 
* EKO 2 – Dorćol /SRC Milan Gale Muškatirović/ – Beograd na vodi. The line was introduced on 24 January 2022.
In addition to those, there is a Vrabac (, meaning &quot;sparrow&quot;) line of electric minibuses serving the pedestrian streets in the centre of Belgrade. Those are free to passengers and painted with a blue color. The line is circular and has eight stops, going from Obilićev venac to Studentski trg, then Kosančićev venac and back to Obilićev venac.

====Seasonal buses====
In addition to regular lines, six seasonal ones exist. Five of them, operating under the names ADA-1 through ADA-5, provide public transport to Ada Ciganlija, known as the Belgrade&#x27;s sea. Those begin working on the last Saturday of June. The sixth one, line 400, goes from Voždovac to the peak of the Avala Mountain. It starts operation on May 1. All six lines work until September 1.
* ADA 1 – Trg republike – Ada Ciganlija – Vidikovac
* ADA 2 – Zemun /Kej oslobođenja/ – Ada Ciganlija
* ADA 3 – Konjarnik – Ada Ciganlija
* ADA 4 – Mirijevo – Ada Ciganlija
* ADA 5 – Bežanijska kosa – Ada Ciganlija
* 400 – Voždovac – Vrh Avale

===Tramways and trolleys===


The first tram line was introduced in 1892. The current extent of the network track has been unchanged since 1988, though with some re-routings of the tram lines. Trams and trolleys are operated exclusively by GSP Beograd. Trolleybuses are confined to the right bank, while the tram network reaches the left bank, too: lines 7, 9, 11 and 13 terminate at Block 45. Lines 7 and 9 use the Old Sava Bridge, while lines 11 and 13 go via the newer Ada Bridge.

====Tram lines====
Belgrade has 11 current trams (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14). Tram line 2 (&quot;dva&quot;) is a circular line around the downtown, so often downtown is referred to as &quot;krug dvojke&quot; (the circle of line 2)
* 2 – Pristаnište – Vukov spomenik – Pristаnište
* 3 – Kneževаc – Slavija – Omladinski stadion
* 5 – Kаlemegdаn (Donji grad) – Ustаničkа
* 6 – Tаšmаjdаn – Ustаničkа
* 7 – Ustаničkа – Block 45 (New Belgrade)
* 9 – Banjica – Block 45 (New Belgrade)
* 10 – Kalemegdan (Donji grad) – Banjica
* 11 – Kalemegdan (Donji grad) – Block 45 (New Belgrade)
* 12 – Bаnovo brdo – Omlаdinski stаdion
* 13 – Banovo brdo – Block 45 (New Belgrade)
* 14 – Ustanička – Banjica

====Tram network and termini====

All the revenue service track is constructed as parallel double track with terminal loops. 
There are 8 revenue service loops in the system: Kneževac, Omladinski stadion, Kalemegdan, Ustanička, Tašmajdan, Block 45, Banjica, Banovo brdo. 
There are further 9 auxiliary loops: Pristanište, Slavija, Autokomanda, Trošarina, Radio industrija, Gospodarska mehana, Topčider, Railway station, Rakovica. Only the first three are actively used for cutting short during the schedule disruptions. The loops Slavija and Autokomanda are located in roundabouts and are normally used for the revenue thru-traffic. Other auxiliary loops are used only as alternatives during the closures. The last two loops (Rakovica and Railway Station) are defunct. The track at Rakovica is disconnected from the main line. The loop at Railway station was recently reconstructed but is completely out of use due to unworkable design. The circular line 2 does not use loops at its terminus at Pristanište. It makes the service stops on the main line instead.

====Tram depots====

There are 3 tram depots in Belgrade. Sava is the central active service depot built in New Belgrade in 1988. Dorćol (&quot;Lower depot&quot;) is the historical electrical cars depot from 1894 which is used only for auxiliary and overhaul purposes. It is co-located with the active service trolleybus depot. The two single-track lines leading to it are the only exceptions to otherwise parallel double track network in the system and are not used in the revenue service. The third &quot;Upper depot&quot; is the historical horse-drawn cars depot from 1892. It retains its track but was recently disconnected from the main line. The depot is completely void of trams and is now housing only the overhead wiring maintenance unit. The plans to adapt it into the public transportation museum have never materialised.

====Trolleybus lines====

The first trolleybus line was introduced in 1947 to replace trams on the central corridor Kalemegdan-Slavija. The network extent is unchanged since late 1980s, though with minor relocation of the central terminus from Kalemegdan to Studentski trg in late 1990s. Belgrade has 7 current trolleybuses (19, 21, 22, 28, 29, 40 and 41).

* 19 – Trg Slavija – Konjаrnik
* 21 – Trg Slavija – Učiteljsko nаselje
* 22 – Trg Slavija – Kruševаčkа
* 28 – Studentski trg – Zvezdara
* 29 – Studentski trg – Medаković 3
* 40 – Zvezdara – Bаnjicа 2
* 41 – Studentski trg – Bаnjicа 2

====Trolley network and termini====

There are 4 revenue service terminal loops in the system: Studentski trg, Konjarnik, Banjica 2, Medaković 3. The peripheral termini Učiteljsko naselje, Kruševačka and Zvezdara have no purpose-built loops: the trolleybuses are circling around the city block instead.
Additionally, there are 3 auxiliary loops in the system: Slavija, Crveni krst and Banjica 1. The auxiliary loops are actively used for cutting short during the schedule disruptions (the line number carries the suffix &quot;L&quot; on the departures to be cut short). Crveni krst and Banjica 1 can be used only in the direction towards the peripheral termini, Slavija can be used in both directions. Due to the insufficient number of correct trolleybuses on line 21, buses marked 21A are operated, and two buses also operate on line 40.

===Minibuses===
In April 2007, six minibus lines were introduced (E1-E7, except E3) which criss-cross Belgrade. Minibuses are all air-conditioned, smaller and generally quicker than buses. However, tickets are bought inside a minibus and they are more expensive than ordinary ones – since minibuses are out of integrated tariff system.

==Rapid transit==

Belgrade is one of the few European capitals and cities with a population of over a million which have no metro/subway or another rapid transit system.

===Metro===

The idea of a metro system for Belgrade has been around for nearly a century. The Belgrade Metro started construction in November 2021 and the first line is scheduled to open in the year 2028. It is considered to be the third most important project in the country, after work on roads and railways. The two projects of highest priority are the Belgrade bypass and Pan-European corridor X.

===Inter-Cityrail===

On September 1, 2010, as an &quot;almost&quot; metro line and the actual metro&#x27;s 1st phase, the first line of Belgrade&#x27;s new urban BG:Voz system, separate from suburban commuter Beovoz system, started its operation. The first line at the time connected Pančevački Most Station with Novi Beograd Railway Station and used the semi-underground level of Beograd Centar rail station, two underground stations (Vukov Spomenik and Karađorđev park) and tunnels in the city centre that were built for ground rail tracks to Novi Beograd. The line had just 5 stations (Pančevački most, Vukov spomenik, Karađorđev park, Beograd Centar and Novi Beograd, which it shared with Beovoz), was 8 kilometer long and the commute took about 16 minutes. Train frequency was from 30 minutes with 15 minutes frequency during rush hour. The line uses the stock similar to suburban Soviet/Latvian electric rolling stocks with upper current collectors including ER31 with 3 doors along the side of car. In April 2011, the line was extended to Batajnica, and in December 2016 to Ovča. The new line has a daily riding of about 18500. A new line from Ovča to Resnik is planned to open in 2018.

==Suburban==
===Buses===
Suburban bus transportation is conducted by SP Lasta. Beside Lasta, certain number of suburban lines are operated by other carriers, too. 
Suburban transport on the territory of Belgrade is performed within the integrated tariff system 2 (ITS2), with over 300 lines and 2,500 daily departures. The network of suburban lines spreads radially from Belgrade to the centers of the suburban municipalities, from which Lasta&#x27;s local lines can be used to reach smaller places. Suburban buses depart from the Lasta Bus Station in Belgrade and from the terminus of Šumice near Konjarnik in the neighbourhood of Zvezdara and another in Banovo Brdo. Lasta transports passengers in the local transport in the areas of the Mladenovac, Sopot, Lazarevac, Obrenovac, Grocka, and Barajevo municipalities.

===Railway (now disfunct)===
Similar to French RER, suburban rail system Beovoz was operated by Serbian Railways, the national railway company. In its final stage, Beovoz had six lines with 41 stations and 70 km length:

*Line 1 Nova Pazova – Pančevo Vojlovica
*Line 2 Ripanj – Pančevo Vojlovica
*Line 3 Nova Pazova – Novi Beograd
*Line 4 Pančevo Vojlovica – Valjevo
*Line 5 Pančevo Glavna – Valjevo

This system became defunct in 2013.

The most of system&#x27;s stations are now used for the BG voz system.

==Taxi==
Taxi service is operated by 24 taxi companies, and is medium expensive (start is about 2.75 euros (320 Dinars).
Every Belgrade taxi company it sign on top of the vihicle.

==Bus==
Belgrade is connected by intercity bus lines with all major towns in Serbia, while during summer and winter tourist seasons there are also special seasonal lines.
There is a good connection with the cities in Republika Srpska and North Macedonia. The international bus lines to Western Europe are mainly focused on Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France, where buses can be taken for all other destinations.

SP Lasta, besides suburban transport, carries passengers in intercity transport on regular lines in Serbia and Montenegro and Republika Srpska and in international transport, as part of the Eurolines organization.

==Train==

The Belgrade railroad network is currently under reconstruction . The massive reconstruction scheme of the Belgrade railway junction calls for completion of the new central Prokop railway station that is to replace the historical Belgrade Main railway station (, &quot;Glavna železnička stanica&quot;) situated near the downtown and Sava river. Belgrade is directly connected by train with many European cities (Thessaloniki, Istanbul, Sofia, Bucharest, Budapest, Vienna, Kyiv, Moscow, etc).

In addition, there are 5 more railway stations in Belgrade (Centar – Prokop, Dunav, Rakovica, Novi Beograd, Zemun). Some long distance and international trains do not call at Central Station, but at Novi Beograd.

A new central railway station has been under construction since 1977 at the site named Prokop. The new railway station will be called &quot;Beograd Center&quot;; upon its completion all Belgrade rail traffic currently handled by the old railway station situated near the downtown district will be transferred to the new station freeing thousands of square meters of prime real estate along the Sava and substantially easing the rail travel into Belgrade. After years of delay, this ambitious project is set to be completed in the next few years pending the new international tender for its completion set to be announced by the government at the beginning of March 2006. The train terminals will be situated underground while the vast passenger terminal will be above ground featuring commercial spaces, possibly a hotel and other amenities. Most of the rough work on the station&#x27;s train terminals has been completed thus far. Belgrade has been restricted in its use of its vast waterfront precisely because of the large rail infrastructure that hug the river banks of the Old Town. Completion of this station is signaling a major boom in Belgrade&#x27;s waterfront development.

==Air==
The international airport, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, is located 12 km outside the city. It is connected with the city by the Belgrade – Zagreb highway. Bus line of public transport number 72 and A1 connect Airport with downtown. Airport provides connections with many cities in Europe, Asia and Africa.
A major expansion of the airport in Belgrade has been detailed with a development deal signed with DynaCorp. Inc. to build a regional air cargo hub, but the plan has failed. Belgrade airport also plans to build a third passenger terminal and another runway; however this may not be feasible in the immediate future.

Batajnica Air Base is a military airport located in the Batajnica suburb of Belgrade.

==River==

Belgrade has a commercial port on the banks of Danube named Luka Beograd. There is also a tourist port on the banks of the Sava welcoming various river cruise vessels from across Europe. Belgrade has several impromptu sporting marinas near the islands of Ada Ciganlija and Ada Međica harbouring small sail boats and sporting/recreational vessels. There are no regular passenger lines from the Belgrade Port (Luka Beograd), although tourist and individual lines run occasionally. Answering to the need for a real sporting/recreational marina a detailed plan for a marina in Dorćol on the banks of the Danube has been presented to the public, and an international tender for its development has been announced.

===Bridges===

There are nine bridges over the Sava and two over the Danube river, listed below:

====Sava====
*&quot;Obrenovac-Surčin Bridge&quot; (&quot;Most Obrenovac-Surčin&quot;), the two-lane road truss bridge over the Sava at Obrenovac — 30 km southwest of Belgrade, constructed by Mostogradnja between 1994 and 1999. The total length of the bridge is 446.5 m, with the longest span of 141 m. The bridge was originally designed to carry only two heating water pipelines, but was later redesigned and built as a road bridge with the two pipelines on side cantilevers. Finished in 2011.
*Obrenovac-Surčin Bridge (A2 motorway) Six lanes expressway bridge under construction. Opening is late 2019.
*The single-track railway truss bridge over Sava at Ostružnica — just outside the urbanized area of Belgrade, serving the freight bypass line. The bridge was badly damaged during the 1999 NATO bombing. Fully reconstructed in 2002.
*&quot;Ostružnica Bridge&quot; (&quot;Ostružnički most&quot;) is the three-lane semi-highway girder bridge over Sava at Ostružnica on the Belgrade bypass motorway — constructed by Mostogradnja between 1990 and 1998. Total length of the bridge is 1,789.6 m, with a 588 m long continuous steel structure crossing the river in five spans. The largest span is 198 m. The bridge was bombed by NATO during the Kosovo war in 1999 and fully reconstructed by 2004. The additional three-lane span is currently under construction and it will be opened in March 2020.
*&quot;Ada Bridge&quot; (&quot;Most na Adi&quot;) a 969 m long and 200 m tall pylon bridge with six-lane roadway and unlaid double-track mass transit right-of-way is opened in 2012.
*&quot;New Railroad Bridge&quot; (&quot;Novi železnički most&quot;) over the Sava — a double-track cable-stayed bridge built in 1979.
*&quot;Old Railroad Bridge&quot; (&quot;Stari železnički most&quot;) over the Sava — a single-track truss-bridge originally built in 1886.
*&quot;Gazela Bridge&quot; (&quot;Gazela&quot;) — a single-span six-lane motorway bridge over the Sava, the main traffic artery into the city, built in 1970.
*&quot;Old Sava Bridge&quot; (&quot;Stari savski most&quot;) — a 410 m long two-lane road and tram bridge. The main span is a tied arch bridge over 100 m in length. During World War II it was the only road bridge available in Belgrade, the current span being installed in 1942, and one of the few bridges in Europe which the retreating German forces failed to demolish. In October 1944, the bridge, already laden with explosives and prepared for demolition, was saved by a local resistance veteran Miladin Zarić who managed to cut the detonator wires. Adding new lanes and full reconstruction is scheduled for 2017. Total investment is 60 million Euros.
*&quot;Branko&#x27;s Bridge&quot; (&quot;Brankov most&quot;) — a 450 m long six-lane road girder bridge over Sava, connecting the center of Belgrade to the densely populated residential suburb of Novi Beograd. Originally built as &quot;Most kralja Aleksandra&quot; (Bridge of King Alexander) in 1934 it was a chain-bridge. The bridge was destroyed in 1941 and rebuilt in 1956 as a single-span bridgeč at the time it was the longest bridge of that kind in the world.

====Danube====
*&quot;Pupin Bridge&quot; (&quot;Pupinov most&quot;) is the newest six-lane road bridge over the Danube. Named after scientist Mihajlo Pupin, it was constructed by the China Road and Bridge Corporation and opened in December 2014.
*&quot;Pančevo Bridge&quot; (&quot;Pančevački most&quot;) — a 1,075 m long combined four-lane road and double-track railroad truss bridge over the Danube, originally built in 1935. It was destroyed during World War II, and rebuilt after the end of the war in 1946. The overhaul and installation of the second rail track was completed in 2015.

==Roads==

Belgrade is connected by motorways to Zagreb to the west, Novi Sad to the north and Niš to the south. The motorways feed traffic into a large interchange popularly called &quot;Mostar&quot;. A wide boulevard, Kneza Miloša street, connects the interchange to the city centre.

A traffic decongestion project named &quot;unutrašnji magistralni prsten&quot; (&quot;inner ring road&quot;) is set to begin with the goal of easing the congestion in the city centre and on the motorways.

<doc id="612455" wikidata="Q1641162" url="?curid=612455" title="Vice President of India">
<text>The vice president of India (ISO: ) is the deputy to the head of state of the Republic of India, i.e. the president of India. The office of vice president is the second-highest constitutional office after the president and ranks second in the order of precedence and first in the line of succession to the presidency. The vice president is also the &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the Rajya Sabha.

 of the Constitution of India states the manner of election of the vice president. The vice president is elected indirectly by members of an electoral college consisting of the members of both Houses of Parliament and not the members of state legislative assembly by the system of proportional representation using single transferable votes and the voting is conducted by Election Commission of India via secret ballot. The vice president also acts as the chancellor of the Panjab University and Delhi University.

Jagdeep Dhankhar of the Bharatiya Janata Party is the current vice president. He became vice president after defeating Indian National Congress candidate Margaret Alva in the 2022 Indian vice presidential election.

== Election, oath and term ==

=== Qualifications ===
As in the case of the president, to be qualified to be elected as vice president, a person must:
* Be a citizen of India.
* Be at least 35 years of age.
* Not to be hold any office of profit.

*Not necessary to be an MP but should be eligible for Rajya Sabha seat

Unlike in the case of the president, where a person is a member of the Lok Sabha, the vice president must be qualified for election as a member of the Rajya Sabha. This difference is because the vice president is to act as the &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the Rajya Sabha. At a time the vice president acts in either of two capacities (i.e. chairman of the Rajya Sabha or vice president of India); he cannot act in both offices simultaneously.

=== Election ===
The vice president is elected indirectly, by an electoral college consisting of members (elected as well as nominated) of both Houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha &amp; Rajya Sabha), by the system of proportional representation using single transferable votes and the voting is by secret ballot. The election of the vice president is slightly different from the election of the president as the members of state legislatures are not part of the electoral college but the nominated members of Rajya Sabha are part of it.

The nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the vice president must be subscribed by at least 20 electors as proposers and 20 electors as seconders. Every candidate has to make a security deposit of in the Reserve Bank of India.

The Election Commission of India, which is a constitutional autonomous body, conducts the election. The election is to be held no later than 60 days of the expiry of the term of office of the outgoing vice president. A returning officer is appointed for the election, usually the secretary-general of either House of Parliament, by rotation. The returning officer issues a public notice of the intended election, inviting nomination of candidates. Any person qualified to be elected and intending to stand for election is required to be nominated by at least twenty members of Parliament as proposers, and at least twenty other members of Parliament as seconders. The nomination papers are scrutinized by the returning officer, and the names of all eligible candidates are added to the ballot.

The election is held via proportional representation using single transferable votes by secret ballot. Voters stack-rank the candidates, assigning 1 to their first preference, 2 to their second preference, and so on. The number of votes required by a candidate to secure the election is calculated by dividing the total number of valid cast votes by two and adding one to the quotient by disregarding any remainder. If no candidate obtains the required number of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated and his or her second-preference votes are transferred. The process is repeated until a candidate obtains the requisite number of votes. Nominated members can also participate in the election.

After the election has been held and the votes counted, the returning officer declares the result of the election to the electoral college. Thereafter, the returning officer reports the result to the Government of India (Ministry of Law and Justice) and the Election Commission of India, and the government publishes the name of the person elected as vice president, in the Official Gazette.

The vice president may resign office by submitting a letter of resignation to the president. The resignation becomes effective from the day it is accepted.

If the Vice president resigns then the vacant post has to be filled as soon as possible whereas in the case of President, election has to be held within 6 months.

=== Election disputes ===
All disputes arising in connection with the election of the vice president are petitioned to the Supreme Court of India, which inquires into the matter. The petition is heard by a five-member bench of the Supreme Court, which decides on the matter. The decision of the Supreme Court is final.

The Supreme Court inquires into and decides upon all &quot;doubts&quot; and &quot;disputes&quot; arising out of or in connection with the election of the vice president per of the constitution. The Supreme Court can remove the vice president for committing electoral malpractices or upon being ineligible to be a Rajya Sabha member under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Subject to , Parliament has made applicable rules or procedure to petition the Supreme Court for resolving the &quot;disputes&quot; that arise only during the election process of the vice president but not the &quot;doubts&quot; that arise from his unconstitutional actions or deeds or changing citizenship during his tenure which may violate the requisite election qualifications. The Supreme Court shall also expeditiously decide any doubt raised by which the elected vice president could be ineligible to be a Rajya Sabha member for the unconstitutional acts committed before becoming vice president. Under , it is the responsibility of the Supreme Court to inquire and decide about the so-called unconstitutional acts committed by the vice president such as turning down the notice of the Rajya Sabha members to impeach the chief justice of India and other judges of Supreme Court and High Courts per and Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 or allowing a bill passed under simple majority instead of procedure applicable to constitutional amendment or falsely declaring a bill passed.

=== Oath or affirmation ===
 of the Constitution of India provides for the oath or affirmation for the office of vice president as follows:-
&quot;I, A.B., do swear in the name of God /solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established and that I will discharge the duty upon which I am about to enter.&quot;The president administers the oath of office and secrecy to the vice president.

== Term ==
The vice president holds office for five years. The vice president can be re-elected any number of times. However, the office may be terminated earlier by death, resignation, or removal. The Constitution does not provide a mechanism of succession to the office of vice president in the event of an extraordinary vacancy, apart from re-election. However, the deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha can perform the vice president&#x27;s duties as the chairman of the Rajya Sabha in such an event.

However, when the president dies in office and vice president takes over as president, the vice president can continue serving as the president for a maximum of 6 months within which a new president shall be elected.

== Removal ==
The Constitution states that the vice president can be removed by a resolution of the Rajya Sabha passed by an effective majority (majority of all the then members) and agreed by the Lok Sabha with a simple majority (). But no such resolution may be moved unless at least 14 days notice in advance has been given. Notably, the Constitution does not list grounds for removal. No vice president has ever faced removal or the chairman in the Rajya Sabha cannot be challenged in any court of law per 

The Supreme Court can inquire into and decide on the disputes related to election of the vice president as per of the constitution. However, the constitution does not mention any specific ground on which the vice president can be removed.

== Salary and pension ==
There is no provision for the salary of the vice president of India in that capacity. The vice president receives a salary in the capacity of the &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the Rajya Sabha, which is currently per month (revised from 125,000 in 2018). In addition, the vice president is entitled to free furnished residence, medical, travel, and other facilities. The constitution provides that when the vice president acts as the president or discharges the duties of the president, the vice president is entitled to the salary and privileges of the president. The pension for the vice president is 50% of the salary. In fact, he is the only official who does not get any salary and emoluments of his designated post (i.e. vice president).

<text>Fishboy: Denizen of the Deep was a black and white comic strip appearing in the British comic book &quot;Buster&quot; between 1968 and 1975, written by Scott Goodall and drawn by John Stokes and others. As with most UK comic strips, neither the writer nor artists were credited.

The title character is a British boy who was abandoned on a desert island as a baby and survived as a feral child by learning to breathe underwater and talk to shark and other sea creatures. He also developed webbed fingers and toes which gave him the ability to swim, as fast as a car.

The strip follows his adventures as a teenager as he travels the world&#x27;s seas searching for his long-lost parents and helping people in trouble.

Goodall also wrote &quot;Kid Chameleon&quot; for &quot;Cor!!&quot;, another comic strip featuring a feral boy on a similar quest.

Fishboy appears, dead and displayed in a case in a Scottish prison, in the 2005 comic &quot;Albion&quot;, as one of many comic book characters, who were imprisoned by the British government. He was captured off the coast of Japan. He seemingly grew more fish-like since his last appearance in &quot;Buster&quot;.

<doc id="612467" wikidata="Q209758" url="?curid=612467" title="Xenomorph">
<text>The xenomorph (also known as a Xenomorph XX121, Internecivus raptus, or simply the alien or the creature) is a fictional endoparasitoid extraterrestrial species that serves as the main antagonist of the &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; franchises.

The species made its debut in the film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and reappeared in the sequels &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992), &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), and &quot;&quot; (2024). The species returns in the prequel series, first with a predecessor in &quot;Prometheus&quot; (2012) and a further evolved form in &quot;&quot; (2017), and the 2019 short films &quot;Alien: Containment&quot;, &quot;Specimen&quot;, &quot;Night Shift&quot;, &quot;Ore&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. It also featured in the crossover films &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004) and &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; (2007), with the skull and tail of one of the creatures respectively appearing briefly in &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990), &quot;&quot; (2005), &quot;Predators&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Predator&quot; (2018), as a protagonist (named 6) in the video game &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; (2010), and will return in the upcoming FX television series &quot;&quot; (2025). In addition, the xenomorph appears in various literature and video game spin-offs from the franchises.

The xenomorph&#x27;s design is credited to Swiss surrealist and artist H. R. Giger, originating in a lithograph titled &quot;Necronom IV&quot; and refined for the series&#x27;s first film, &quot;Alien&quot;. The practical effects for the xenomorph&#x27;s head were designed and constructed by Italian special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Species design and life cycle have been extensively augmented, sometimes inconsistently, throughout each film.

Unlike many other extraterrestrial races in film and television science fiction (such as the Daleks and Cybermen in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, or the Klingons and Borg in &quot;Star Trek&quot;), the xenomorphs are not sapient they lack a technological civilization of any kind, and are instead primal, predatory creatures with no higher goal than the preservation and propagation of their own species by any means necessary, up to and including the elimination of other lifeforms that may pose a threat to their existence. Like wasps or termites, xenomorphs are eusocial, with a single fertile queen breeding a caste of warriors, workers, or other specialist strains. The xenomorphs&#x27; biological life cycle involves traumatic implantation of endoparasitoid larvae inside living hosts; these &quot;chestburster&quot; larvae erupt from the host&#x27;s body after a short incubation period, mature into adulthood within hours, and seek out more hosts for implantation.

==Concept and creation==

The script for the 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot; was initially drafted by Dan O&#x27;Bannon and Ronald Shusett. Dan O&#x27;Bannon drafted an opening in which the crew of a mining ship are sent to investigate a mysterious message on an alien planet. He eventually settled on the threat being an alien creature; however, he could not conceive of an interesting way for it to get onto the ship. Inspired after waking from a dream, Shusett said, &quot;I have an idea: the monster screws one of them&quot;, planting its egg in his body, and then bursting out of his chest. Both realized the idea had never been done before, and it subsequently became the core of the film. &quot;This is a movie about alien interspecies rape&quot;, O&#x27;Bannon said in the documentary &quot;Alien Evolution&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s scary because it hits all of our buttons.&quot; O&#x27;Bannon felt that the symbolism of &quot;homosexual oral rape&quot; was an effective means of discomforting male viewers.

The title of the film was decided late in the script&#x27;s development. O&#x27;Bannon had quickly dropped the film&#x27;s original title, &quot;Star Beast&quot;, but could not think of a name to replace it. &quot;I was running through titles, and they all stank&quot;, O&#x27;Bannon said in an interview, &quot;when suddenly, that word &quot;alien&quot; just came out of the typewriter at me. &quot;Alien&quot;. It&#x27;s a noun and it&#x27;s an adjective.&quot; The word &quot;alien&quot; subsequently became the title of the film and, by extension, the name of the creature itself.

Prior to writing the script to &quot;Alien&quot;, O&#x27;Bannon had been working in France for Chilean cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s planned adaptation of Frank Herbert&#x27;s classic science-fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot;. Also hired for the project was Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger. Giger showed O&#x27;Bannon his nightmarish, monochromatic artwork, which left O&#x27;Bannon deeply disturbed. &quot;I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work&quot; he remembered later. The &quot;Dune&quot; film collapsed, but O&#x27;Bannon would remember Giger when &quot;Alien&quot; was greenlit, and suggested to director Ridley Scott that he be brought on to design the Alien, saying that if he were to design a monster, it would be truly original.
After O&#x27;Bannon handed him a copy of Giger&#x27;s book &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, Scott immediately saw the potential for Giger&#x27;s designs, and chose &quot;Necronom IV&quot;, a print Giger completed in 1976, as the basis for the Alien&#x27;s design, citing its beauty and strong sexual overtones. That the creature could just as easily have been male or female was also a strong factor in the decision to use it. &quot;It could just as easily fuck you before it killed you,&quot; said line producer Ivor Powell, &quot;[which] made it all the more disconcerting.&quot; 20th Century Fox was initially wary of allowing Giger onto the project, saying that his works would be too disturbing for audiences, but eventually relented. Giger initially offered to completely design the Alien from scratch, but Scott mandated that he base his work on &quot;Necronom IV&quot;, saying that to start over from the beginning would be too time-consuming. Giger initially signed on to design the adult, egg, and chestburster forms, but ultimately also designed the alien planetoid LV-426 and the Space Jockey alien vessel.

Giger conceived the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes because he felt that it made them much more frightening if you could not tell they were looking at you. Giger also gave the Alien&#x27;s mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed &quot;biomechanical&quot;, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls-Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien&#x27;s animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.
Scott decided on the man-in-suit approach for creating the creature onscreen. Initially circus performers were tried, then multiple actors together in the same costume, but neither proved scary. Deciding that the creature would be scarier the closer it appeared to a human, Scott decided that a single, very tall, very thin man be used. Scott was inspired by a photograph of Leni Riefenstahl standing next to a Nuba man. The casting director found , rail-thin graphic designer Bolaji Badejo in a London pub. Badejo went to tai chi and mime classes to learn how to slow down his movements.

Giger&#x27;s design for the Alien evoked many contradictory sexual images. As critic Ximena Gallardo notes, the creature&#x27;s combination of sexually evocative physical and behavioral characteristics creates &quot;a nightmare vision of sex and death. It subdues and opens the male body to make it pregnant, and then explodes it in birth. In its adult form, the alien strikes its victims with a rigid phallic tongue that breaks through skin and bone. More than a phallus, however, the retractable tongue has its own set of snapping, metallic teeth that connects it to the castrating vagina dentata.&quot;

===Name===
This creature has no specific name; it was called an alien and an organism in the first film. It has also been referred to as a creature, a serpent, a beast, a dragon, a monster, a nasty, or simply, a thing. The term &quot;xenomorph&quot; (lit. &quot;alien form&quot; from the Greek &quot;xeno-&quot;, which translates as either &quot;other&quot; or &quot;strange&quot;, and &quot;-morph&quot;, which denotes shape) was first used by the character Lieutenant Gorman in &quot;Aliens&quot; with reference to generic extraterrestrial life. The term was erroneously assumed by some fans to refer specifically to this creature, and the word was used by the producers of some merchandise.

The species&#x27; binomial names are given in Latin as either &quot; &quot; (meant as &quot;murderous thief&quot;) in the &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; DVD or &quot; &quot; (meant as &quot;foul tongue from Acheron&quot;) in some comic books. The main Alien from &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; is listed in the credits as &quot;Grid&quot;, after a grid-like wound received during the film from a Predator&#x27;s razor net. &quot;&quot; actually credits the Alien as Xenomorph, while also listing a different variety of the creature as the Neomorph. In &quot;The Weyland-Yutani Report&quot;, the Alien encountered by the &quot;Nostromo&quot; was specifically referred to as &quot;Xenomorph XX121&quot;, and this name is spoken out loud by the android Rook in &quot;&quot;.

==Characteristics==

At its core, the &quot;xenomorph&quot; is a hostile parasitic pathogen (Chemical A0-3959X.91) whose mutable mechanisms are signaled by perturbances to its chemistry. It evolves to assume biological and physiological traits of its host, thereby enabling it to adapt to its environment. As the film series has progressed, the creature&#x27;s design has been modified in many ways, including differing numbers of fingers and limb joints and variations in the design of the Alien&#x27;s head.

===Appearance===

When standing upright, the Aliens are bipedal in form, though, depending on their host species, they will adopt either a hunched stance or remain fully erect when walking, sprinting, or in hotter environments. Their overall stance and general behavior seem to result from the mixture of the respective DNA of the embryo and its host. They have a skeletal, biomechanical appearance and are usually colored in muted shades of black, gray, blue or bronze. Their body heat matches the ambient temperature of the environment in which they are found, so they do not radiate heat, making them indistinguishable from their surroundings through thermal imaging. In most of the films, adult Aliens are capable of running and crawling along ceilings, walls, and other hard surfaces. They have great physical strength, having been shown to be capable of breaking through welded steel doors over time.

Aliens have segmented, blade-tipped tails. The sharp tip was initially a small, scorpion-like barb, but from &quot;Aliens&quot; onwards the blade design increased in size and changed in appearance to more closely resemble a slashing weapon. From &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; onwards, the tails have a flat ridge of spines at the base of the blade. This was introduced to help them swim convincingly, and was left intact in the subsequent crossovers. The original shooting script for &quot;Aliens&quot; and the novelization both featured a scene in which Lieutenant Gorman is &quot;stung&quot; by the barb tail and rendered unconscious; in the final cut of the movie, Gorman is knocked out by falling crates. As a weapon, the strength of the tail is very effective, having been shown to be strong enough to impale and lift a Predator with seemingly little effort.

They have elongated, cylindrical skulls with eyes underneath the &quot;visor&quot;. In the novelization of &quot;Alien&quot;, the character Ash speculates that the xenomorphs &quot;see&quot; by way of electrical impulse, similar to some fish&#x27;s Ampullae of Lorenzini. This method is illustrated in the original &quot;Alien vs Predator&quot; PC game and reused for the Predalien 28 years later. The Alien&#x27;s inner set of jaws is powerful enough to smash through bone and metal. How the creatures see is uncertain; in &quot;Alien 3&quot;, a spherical lens was used to illustrate the Alien&#x27;s point of view, so, when the film was projected anamorphically, the image exhibited severe distortion. In the novelization of the movie &quot;Alien&quot;, the creature is held mesmerized by a spinning green light for several minutes.

In &quot;Aliens&quot;, the adult creatures have a more textured head rather than a smooth carapace. In the commentary for &quot;Aliens&quot;, it was speculated that this was part of the maturation of the creatures, as they had been alive far longer than the original Alien, although James Cameron stated that he simply left the carapace off because he liked them better that way. The smooth design of the carapace would be used again in &quot;Alien 3&quot; and &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, although made narrower with a longer muzzle and more prominent chin. This design would be kept in &quot;Alien versus Predator&quot;, and abandoned in &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; in favor of the ribbed design.

Throughout their appearances, human-spawned Aliens have been shown to have different numbers of fingers. In &quot;Alien&quot;, the creature has webbed, six-fingered hands. In &quot;Aliens&quot;, the number of fingers is reduced to three, with two &quot;paired&quot; and a single, opposable thumb. The fingers are also shown to be much longer and more skeletal. In &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, the number of digits is increased to four, with two long middle fingers and a pair of thumbs. This design is kept in the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; films, though the hands were made bulkier in order to make the Aliens seem more formidable against the Predators.

Aliens have been alternatively portrayed as both plantigrade and digitigrade organisms, usually relative to their hosts. Human-spawned Aliens were usually portrayed as having humanoid hind limbs, while in &quot;Alien 3&quot; the featured Alien sported double-jointed legs due to its quadrupedal host. This characteristic would be continued in &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; for the human-spawned Aliens. Tom Woodruff, who had previously played the &quot;dog-alien&quot; in &quot;Alien 3&quot;, described the human-spawned Aliens in &quot;Resurrection&quot; as feeling more like a dog than the previous creature, despite having been born from human hosts. The human-spawned Alien warriors would revert to a plantigrade posture in &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;.

===Physiology===
Alien blood contains concentrated hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid and is capable of corroding almost any substance on contact with alarming speed. It is dull yellow in color and appears to be pressurized inside the body so that it spurts out with great force when the creature is wounded. Ron Cobb suggested the idea of the Alien having acidic blood as a plausible means to make the creature &quot;unkillable&quot;; if one were to use traditional firearms or explosives to attack it, its blood would eat through the hull of the ship. The &quot;Alien&quot; novelization suggests that, at least at the &quot;facehugger&quot; stage, the acid is not blood but a fluid maintained under pressure between a double layer of skin. In the &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; documentary &quot;Science of the Alien&quot;, it is hypothesized that the Aliens&#x27; acid blood could contain sulfuric acid due to its corrosiveness and the conspicuously toxic effects on living human tissue. The documentary also speculates that Aliens are immune to their own acidic and toxic liquids due to an endobiological build-up, similar to the human stomach&#x27;s ability to protect itself from its own digestive fluids. The documentary takes this hypothesis one step further and speculates that the Alien organism&#x27;s protection system against its own acidic blood is a bio-organically produced Teflon-like insulation. In the original &quot;Alien&quot;, the facehugger is shown to be able to &quot;spit&quot; acid, dissolving the faceplate of Kane&#x27;s helmet and allowing the creature immediate access inside. This ability is also exhibited by adult Aliens in &quot;Alien 3&quot; and &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;; much like a spitting cobra, they use it to blind their victims.

Aliens can produce a thick, strong resin that they use to build their hives and to cocoon their victims, and they can use the walls of their hives as camouflage. Aliens also salivate heavily in the form of a sticky, clear slime; while not a toxic substance in and of itself, it is common for the &quot;Alien&quot; films to use it as a suspense-building device, wherein a character will notice the falling saliva before noticing its source lying in wait above them.

===Intelligence===
During various events in &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; on the USM &quot;Auriga&quot;, the crossover film &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot; on the LV-426 colony Hadley&#x27;s Hope, and &quot;Alien 3&quot; when they are trying to trap the alien, the species displayed observational learning and problem-solving skills. It&#x27;s also shown the ability to operate machinery at a very basic level, with the queen in &quot;Aliens&quot; depicted operating an elevator.

On the USM &quot;Auriga&quot; in &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, the aliens kill one of their own, using its blood to melt through their enclosure and escape (according to the novelization, it was inspired to do so from genetic memories inherited from the original Ripley); in &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, they use a similar strategy to free the queen from her chains. An alien also uses acid spurting from its severed tail as an improvised weapon by flicking it, indicating awareness of the effects of their acid blood.

In the original film, it is implied that the alien cut the lights on board the &quot;Nostromo.&quot; On LV-426, the xenomorphs cut power in a section of the complex to gain access to the humans.

The novel for the film &quot;Aliens&quot; includes a scene where Bishop speculates on the reason why the queen established her &quot;nest&quot; at the base&#x27;s main power plant. His reasons range from an animalistic drive for warmth to an intentional strategic selection (any attacker could not destroy her without destroying the entire facility). In the director&#x27;s commentary for &quot;Aliens&quot;, James Cameron noted that the creatures in &quot;Aliens&quot; had been alive for far longer than the Alien in the original, and had more time to learn about their environment. In &quot;Alien 3&quot;, Ripley and the inmates try luring the Alien into the lead works. It becomes obvious that the Alien recognized the trap and the danger it held. At one point, it hesitates to enter the lead works. Later, it hunts down most of the prisoners just before going into the lead works.

===Life cycle===
Aliens are eusocial life-forms with a caste system ruled over by a queen. Their life cycle comprises several distinct stages: they begin their lives as an egg, which hatches a parasitoid larval form known as a facehugger, which then attaches itself to a living host by, as its name suggests, latching onto its face. In the &quot;Alien 3&quot; novelization, Ripley commented that this parasitoid would probably be able to use any host from as small as a cat to as large as an Asian elephant.

The facehugger then &quot;impregnates&quot; the host with an embryo, known as a &quot;chestburster&quot;. During this time, the host is kept in an unconscious state with normal vital functions. After depositing the embryo inside the host, the facehugger dies and releases its hold on its victim&#x27;s face and head, as shown in &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;. The host will then experience a short period of near-symptomless recovery during which the embryo is in gestation, followed by the sudden and painful eruption of the chestburster from the host&#x27;s chest, resulting in their death. The chestburster then matures to an adult phase, shedding its skin and replacing its cells with polarized silicon. 

Due to horizontal gene transfer during the gestation period, the alien also takes on some of the basic physical attributes of the host from which it was born (something noticed by Ripley in &quot;Alien 3&quot;, when the xenomorph plaguing the complex moved on four limbs, having gestated within a quadruped (a dog in the theatrical release and an ox in the director&#x27;s cut) whereas all the others she had previously seen had gestated within humans/bipeds), allowing the individual alien to adapt to the host&#x27;s environment (breathe the air, etc.). This is also shown in the two live-action crossover films, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004) and &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; (2007), where an embryo, having gestated within a Predator/Yautja, displayed Predator/Yautja physical traits (arthropod-like mandibles) from eruption onwards.

This process of horizontal gene transfer is also shown to be two-way; in &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (film and novelization), Ripley&#x27;s clone, Ripley-8, is shown exhibiting numerous xenomorph characteristics, physical and behavioural; this is touched more upon in the novelization (chapter 4), where it is described that when a host is infested with an xenomorph embryo, it does not just infest the host like a parasite, but also like a virus, &quot;a major breakthrough in adaptive evolution ... a way to guarantee that any host, any host at all, would provide whatever it was the developing embryo needed, even if/when the host&#x27;s body was inadequate.&quot;

The adult phase of the alien is known by various different names. The adult aliens have been referred to as &quot;drones&quot;, &quot;warriors&quot;, &quot;workers&quot;, and sometimes &quot;soldiers&quot;, similar to the way ants have been defined. The names of the adult phase have also been used to name different types of adult phases of the alien in numerous sources, including video games, comic books, novels, and the films, but only in the commentaries by the team who created the films. No official name has been given to the adult stage of the alien in the films themselves.

====Queen====

Queen aliens are significantly larger and stronger than the normal adults, being approximately tall. Their body structure also differs, having two pairs of arms, one large and one small. The queen&#x27;s head is larger than those of other adult Aliens and is protected by a large, flat crest, like a crown, which varies from queen to queen. Unlike other aliens, the queen&#x27;s external mouth is separately segmented from the rest of her head, allowing her to turn her mouth left and right almost to the point where it is facing perpendicular to the direction of the rest of her head. In the second film, &quot;Aliens&quot;, unlike other adults and queens, the queen had high-heel protrusions from her feet.

Egg-laying Alien queens possess an immense ovipositor attached to their lower torso, similar to a queen termite&#x27;s. Like some insect queens, there appears to be no need for an Alien queen&#x27;s eggs to be fertilized. When attached to her ovipositor, the queen is supported by a &quot;biomechanical throne&quot; that consists of a lattice of struts resembling massive insect legs.

In the original cut of &quot;Alien&quot;, the Alien possessed a complete lifecycle, with the still-living bodies of its victims converted into eggs. However, the scene showing the crew converted into eggs was cut for reasons of pacing, leaving the ultimate origin of the eggs obscure. This allowed &quot;Aliens&quot; director James Cameron to introduce a concept he had initially conceived for a spec script called &quot;Mother&quot;, a massive mother Alien queen which laid eggs and formed the basis for the Aliens&#x27; life cycle. Cameron conceived the queen as a monstrous analogue to Ripley&#x27;s own maternal role in the film. In that vein, some critics have compared it to Grendel&#x27;s mother.

The queen was designed by Cameron in collaboration with special effects artist Stan Winston, based upon an initial painting Cameron had done at the start of the project. The Winston Studio created a test foamcore queen before constructing the full hydraulic puppet which was used for most of the scenes involving the large Alien. Two people were inside working the twin sets of arms, and puppeteers off-screen worked its jaws and head. Although at the end of the film, the queen was presented full-body fighting the power-loader, the audience never sees the legs of the queen, save those of the small-scale puppet that appears only briefly. In &quot;Aliens&quot;, Cameron used very selective camera-angles on the queen, using the &#x27;&#x27; style of photography. Subsequently, the movie won an Oscar for Visual Effects. An adult queen was to reappear in &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;. The original mechanical head previously used in &quot;Aliens&quot; was provided by Bob Burns and was an altered design. It was repainted with a blend of green and brown, giving it a shimmering, insect-like quality. This color concept would be abandoned in &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; in favour of the original black color scheme.

In the climax of &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, the queen&#x27;s basic design was altered to make her more &quot;streamlined&quot; in appearance and her overall size was increased to six meters (20 feet) tall. Other changes include the removal of the &quot;high-heel&quot; protrusions on her legs, including additional spines on her head and making her waist thinner because there was no need for puppeteers inside her chest. The animatronic queen had 47 points of hydraulic motion.

&quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; (2007) introduced a younger form of the full-grown queen, albeit with traits inherited from its Predator host. Recalling the facehugger&#x27;s method of embryo implantation, the Predalien uses its inner mouth to directly deposit multiple chestburster embryos into pregnant female hosts, also using its mandibles to latch on the faces of said hosts, completely bypassing the need for facehuggers. This is explained by the Brothers Strause as a means of quickly building an army of Aliens before the young queen evolves into its sedentary, egg-laying state.

====Egg====
Adult xenomorphs are capable of creating their own reproductive egg (&#x27;ovamorph&#x27;) by embedding their prey into an organic substance that (in theory) metabolically reacts to merge host-parasite genetic material. The entire process is xeno-dominant, resulting in a facehugger. The eggs laid by the queen are ellipsoidal, leathery objects between one-half and one meter (two and three feet) high with a four-lobed opening at the top. The eggs can remain in a stasis mode for years, possibly indefinitely, until nearby movement is detected. As a potential host approaches, the egg&#x27;s lobes unfold like flower petals, and the parasitic facehugger extracts itself from the egg and attaches itself to the potential host.

Giger initially designed the eggs with a much more obvious vaginal appearance, complete with an &quot;inner and outer vulva&quot;. The producers complained that Catholic countries would ban the film if the allusion was too strong, so Giger doubled the lobes to four so that, in his words, &quot;seen from above, they would form the cross that people in Catholic countries are so fond of looking at&quot;.

The interior of the original egg was composed of &quot;Nottingham lace&quot; (caul fat), which is the lining of a cow&#x27;s stomach. In the first film, the quick shot of the facehugger erupting from the egg was done with sheep&#x27;s intestine. Initially, the egg remained totally stationary except for the hydraulic movement of the lobes; however, by &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, the entire egg was made to ripple as it opened. In the Director&#x27;s Cut of &quot;Alien&quot;, an additional scene shows still living crew members being cocooned into new eggs, either morphing into a new embryo or acting as a food source for the facehugger inside the egg. According to the novelization for &quot;Resurrection&quot;, the Egg, in and of itself, could be considered a living organism in its own right.

====Facehugger====

A facehugger is the second stage in the Alien&#x27;s metamorphosis. It has eight long, finger-like legs, which allow it to crawl rapidly, and a long tail adapted for making great leaps. These particular appendages give it an appearance somewhat comparable to chelicerate arthropods such as arachnids and horseshoe crabs.

The facehugger is a parasitoid; its only purpose is to make contact with the host&#x27;s mouth for the implantation process by gripping its legs around the victim&#x27;s head and wrapping its tail around the host&#x27;s neck. Upon making contact, the facehugger administers a cynose-based paralytic to the host in order to render it unconscious and immobile. During a successful attachment, the facehugger will insert an ovipositor down the host&#x27;s throat while simultaneously implanting an embryo. The host is kept alive, and the creature breathes for the host. Attempts to remove facehuggers generally prove fatal to the host, as the parasitoid will respond by tightening its tail around the host&#x27;s neck, and its acidic blood prevents it from being cut away. In addition, its grip on the host&#x27;s head is strong enough to tear the host&#x27;s face off if it is forcibly removed.

Once the Alien embryo is implanted, the facehugger will remain attached until the implant is secure, which can take anywhere from less than a minute to 16 hours. Once this happens, the parasite detaches, crawls away, and dies. The victim awakens with no awareness of the implantation, believing themselves to have been asleep, and appears to have a normal, healthy bodily function.

According to &quot;AVPR: Science of the Xenomorph&quot;, a behind-the-scenes documentary on &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;, it is theorized that facehuggers may implant a viral agent that &quot;commands&quot; the host&#x27;s cells to grow the chestburster, as opposed to an implanted embryo. This is an alternate explanation to horizontal gene transfer as to how the resulting xenomorph is able to adopt the characteristics of its host.

Giger&#x27;s original design for the facehugger was a much larger creature with eyes and a spring-loaded tail. Later, in response to comments from the filmmakers, Giger reduced the creature&#x27;s size substantially. At first, Giger assumed that the facehugger would wrap around the outside of the astronaut&#x27;s helmet, but Scott decided that it would have far more impact if the facehugger was revealed once the helmet was removed. Scott and Giger realized that the facehugger should burn through the helmet&#x27;s faceplate with its acid blood; subsequent redesigns of the space helmet included a far larger faceplate to allow for this.

Dan O&#x27;Bannon initially conceived the facehugger as somewhat resembling an octopus, possessing tentacles. However, when he received H. R. Giger&#x27;s designs, which substituted finger-like digits for tentacles, he found Giger&#x27;s design concept to be superior. Since no one was available at the time, O&#x27;Bannon decided to design the facehugger prop himself. The technical elements of the musculature and bone were added by Ron Cobb. Giger&#x27;s initial design for the smaller facehugger had the fingers facing forward, but O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s redesign shifted the legs to the side. When the foam rubber sculpture of the facehugger was produced, O&#x27;Bannon asked that it should remain unpainted, believing the rubber, which resembled human skin, was more plausible.

There has been some debate about the sexual appearance of the facehugger, some saying it unmistakably resembles female genitalia.

In &quot;Aliens&quot;, the facehuggers were redesigned by Stan Winston so that they would be capable of movement. Unlike the creatures in the first film, the creatures would take a much more active role in impregnating their victims. When Ripley throws one off her, the facehugger is now capable of scuttling across the floor and leaping at its prey, wrapping its tail around the victim&#x27;s throat. The facehugger is also shown to be capable of independently surviving outside of its egg. Due to the film&#x27;s budget, only two fully working facehuggers were built.

In &quot;Alien 3&quot;, another addition was planned but ultimately dropped, a &quot;super-facehugger&quot; that would carry the embryo of the queen Alien. This super-facehugger is briefly glimpsed in the Assembly cut of &quot;Alien 3&quot; but not identified as such. It made a brief appearance in the canonical &quot;Alien&quot; book called &quot;Alien: Sea of Sorrows&quot;, set after the events of &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, about the grandson of Ripley Clone 8, Ellen Ripley&#x27;s clone.

====Chestburster====

After impregnation, facehuggers die and the embryo&#x27;s host wakes up afterward, showing no considerable outward negative symptoms and a degree of amnesia regarding events at the time of implantation. Symptoms build acutely after detachment of the facehugger, the most common being sore throat, slight nausea, increased congestion, and moderate to extreme hunger. In later stages where the incubation period is extended in preparation of a queen birth, symptoms will include a shortness of breath, exhaustion, and hemorrhaging (detectable through biological scanners and present in nosebleeds or other seemingly random bleeding incidents), as well as chest pains caused by a lack of space due to the chestburster&#x27;s presence or even premature attempts to escape the host.

The incubating embryo takes on some of the host&#x27;s DNA or traits, such as bipedalism, quadrupedalism, possessing the mandibles of a Predator, and other structural changes that enable adaptation to its new environment. According to Weyland-Yutani medical scientists in &quot;Aliens: Colonial Marines&quot;, the chestburster will draw nutrients from the host&#x27;s body in order to develop a placenta as it grows, attaching itself to several major organs in the process. The placenta has cancerous qualities, such that even if the embryo were removed surgically, the placenta would simply cause the affected organs to shut down, resulting in death; the only exceptions to this are from human-xenomorph hybrid hosts like the cloned Ripley 8, who survived an extraction procedure without issue.

Over the course of one to 24 hours—indeterminable in some cases, and sometimes up to a week, in the case of some queens—the embryo develops into a chestburster, at which point, it emerges, violently and fatally ripping open the chest of the host.

There is no on-screen explanation of the reasons for the different incubation times. Fully-grown aliens may avoid harming species acting as hosts for un-emerged chestbursters, though this may only be in the case of a queen embryo.

When a chestburster erupts from the body of a human host, it is less than tall, although the embryo can vary in size from a guinea pig to a large dog depending on the size and species of the host. Its appearance and adaptive characteristics are also determined by the host. Typically, its first instinct upon emerging is to flee and hide until full maturation, as well as find a source of nutrition. However, it soon undergoes a dramatic growth spurt, reaching adult size in a matter of hours; in &quot;Alien&quot;, the chestburster had grown to in height by the time the &quot;Nostromo&quot; crew located it again. The chestburster is shown to have molted before reaching maturity. In &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;, Alien warriors who are still growing are shown, displaying shed skin. In the unrated cut, the Predalien is shown wiping off its final molted skin at the film&#x27;s start.

The chestburster was designed by &quot;Alien&quot; director Ridley Scott and constructed by special effects artist Roger Dicken. Giger had produced a model of a chestburster that resembled a &quot;degenerate plucked turkey&quot; and was far too large to fit inside a ribcage. Much to Giger&#x27;s dismay, his model reduced the production team to fits of laughter on sight. Scott drafted a series of alternative designs for the chestburster based on the philosophy of working &quot;back [from the adult] to the child&quot; and ultimately produced &quot;something phallic&quot;. The chestburster in the original &quot;Alien&quot; was armless, but arms were added in &quot;Aliens&quot; to facilitate the creature crawling its way out of its host&#x27;s corpse. This concept would be abandoned in &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, but it would return in &quot;Alien: Covenant&quot;.

===Cocoon===

The xenomorph lifecycle is expanded in the movie with the introduction of a &quot;cocoon&quot; stage, which bridges the gap between the chestburster and the fully-grown adult xenomorph stages as witnessed by the characters Bjorn and Kay while aboard the derelict &quot;Renaissance&quot; space station. It is shown that a chestburster which had emerged from their crewmate Navarro had attached itself to a wall and built a biomechanical protective cocoon around itself after shedding its skin. While inside the cocoon, the chestburster transformed into a fully-grown adult drone xenomorph.

===Alternative forms===
Aliens take on various forms depending on the characteristics of their hosts. Most of the Aliens seen to date have been human-spawned, but a number of Aliens born from other hosts have also been seen. Some of these are also a different variants or species altogether such as the Neomorph and Deacon.

====&quot;Dragon&quot;====
The &quot;Dog Alien&quot; or &quot;Ox Alien&quot;, (also known as &quot;Runner Alien&quot; in the expanded universe stories) and referred to in-film as &quot;Dragon&quot;, was introduced in &quot;Alien 3&quot;. The creature itself shares the same basic physical configuration and instincts as the other Aliens shown in the previous films, although there are several differences due to the host it was spawned from (a dog in the theatrical cut, an ox in the novelized version and the assembly cut). The dog Alien in its chestburster form is a miniature version of the adult, unlike the larval human- and Predator-spawned chestbursters. The adult is primarily quadrupedal, has digitigrade hind legs, and lacks the dorsal tubes of the human-spawned variety. The only differences behavior-wise was that this Alien behaved more like a dog or another quadrupedal animal that generally is prone to using its mouth instead of its front legs as its primary weapon to attack and maul its victims with its teeth. This Alien, even when actively provoked, would not attack or kill Ripley, due to the queen growing inside her. This, however, changed towards the movie&#x27;s climax, at which point the monster, after surviving a torrent of molten lead, burst from the liquid and went into a rampage, pursuing Ripley and presumably attempting to kill her until she destroyed it by showering it with freezing water, causing it to explode from thermal shock.

Originally, H. R. Giger was approached on July 28, 1990, by David Fincher and Tim Zinnemann, and was asked to redesign his own creations for &quot;Alien 3&quot;. Giger&#x27;s new designs included an aquatic face-hugger and a four-legged version of the adult Alien. Giger said in an interview &quot;I had special ideas to make it more interesting. I designed a new creature, which was much more elegant and beastly, compared to my original. It was a four-legged Alien, more like a lethal feline—a panther or something. It had a kind of skin that was built up from other creatures—much like a symbiosis.&quot; However, when Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis of Amalgamated Dynamics told Giger that they had their own design, Giger expressed himself as &quot;very upset&quot; and that the creature he had especially designed was his &quot;baby&quot;. Even after the production severed contact, Giger continued to fax suggestions to Fincher and made full-scale drawings and a sculpt of the Alien, all of which were rejected.

Giger would later be angered by the end credits of the released film presenting him as merely the creator of the original creature, and the fact that ADI personnel gave a series of interviews that minimized Giger&#x27;s contribution. Fox eventually reimbursed Giger, but only after he refused to be interviewed for their behind-the-scenes documentary of &quot;Alien 3&quot;.

However, Giger would comment that he thought the resulting film was &quot;okay&quot; and that the Alien was &quot;better than in the second film&quot;.

====Newborn====

In &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, due to significant genetic tampering in an attempt to recover DNA from the deceased Ellen Ripley and the Alien queen within her, the resulting cloned Aliens show a number of minor human traits. The cloned queen inherits a perversion of a human womb, and as a result, it ceases to lay eggs and gives birth to a humanoid mutant hybrid. Physically, the human/Alien Newborn is very different from other alien young, being larger, with pale, translucent skin, a skull-shaped face with eyes, a human tongue, and a complete absence of a tail. The Newborn fails to bond with its Alien queen mother, killing it, and imprinting on the Ripley clone instead.

The Newborn creature was originally scripted by Joss Whedon as being an eyeless, ivory-white quadruped with red veins running along the sides of its head. It had an inner jaw, with the addition of a pair of pincers on the sides of its head. These pincers would have been used to immobilize its prey as it drained it of blood through the inner jaw. The creature was originally going to rival the queen in size, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet asked ADI to make the human/Alien hybrid, known as the Newborn, more human than Alien. The Newborn&#x27;s eyes and nose were added to improve its expressions to make it a character, rather than just a &quot;killing machine&quot;, and give it depth as a human-like creature.

====Predalien====
This variation is the result of a facehugger impregnating a Predator. The &quot;Predalien&quot; was first depicted in a painting by Dave Dorman, and subsequently featured in the &quot;Aliens versus Predator&quot; comics and games. A Predalien chestburster debuted in the final scene of &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004), but did not make a full on film appearance as an adult until &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot; (2007).

The Predalien shares many characteristics with its hosts, such as long hair-like appendages, mandibles, skin color, blood that glows in the dark (though still acidic), and similar vocalizations. It is a large, bulky creature, and possesses physical strength greater than that of human-spawned Aliens. Like human-born Aliens, it is also shown to be stronger than its host species, as evidenced by its ability to pin, push, and knock a Predator away with ease.

====Deacon====
The dark-blue Deacon is a different species that makes an appearance in &quot;Prometheus&quot;, though it clearly shares traits similar to the xenomorph, including a similar life-cycle. The Deacon is the result of a &quot;Trilobite&quot; (which takes its name from a group of extinct marine arthropods), a large facehugger-like creature, attacking and impregnating an Engineer. After some time, it will burst out of its host, with the notable difference that it is &quot;born&quot; almost fully developed. Its fate is unknown, though the tie-in comic book &quot;Prometheus: Fire and Stone&quot;, also set on LV-223, features a mutated mountain with acidic veins which are implied to be the heavily mutated Deacon&#x27;s deadly back spines.

====Neomorph====
The pale-white Neomorph is featured in &quot;&quot;. It was created through exposure to spores found growing on the Engineer homeworld. The embryonic Neomorph gestates inside the host until it bursts out from wherever in said host they&#x27;ve metastasized (one is seen gaining entry through the ear and emerging from the spine, while a second one, inhaled by nose, later erupts from the host&#x27;s throat; other means of entry and egress are not made clear), using mostly its head, which is sharp and pointed, not unlike the Deacon. Similarly, the Deacon and Neomorph share the same type of Pharyngeal Jaw (similar to that of a Moray Eel) among other distinctly less biomechanical traits than the traditional xenomorph, though the latter does share with the Neomorph a tail strong enough to cause grevious injury; at one point, a violently thrashing Neomorph tail is seen to instantly remove a human jaw. This behavior is just one of several demonstrating the Neomorph&#x27;s far more feral nature; they are voracious predators, often eating the corpses of their victims, and they appear to lack their xenomorph cousins&#x27; hive structure, possibly since they propagate through mutated animal life.

====Offspring====
The Offspring, featured in &quot;&quot;, is the result of pregnant character Kay injecting a serum derived from the Xenomorph&#x27;s genome into her neck, leading to a rapid mutation of her unborn fetus. The creature is violently birthed in an egg, hatches, and rapidly grows to over 8 feet tall. It possesses fleshy skin, black eyes, a tail, a Xenomorph-like tongue with teeth, dorsal tubes, and overall facial similarities to the Engineers. It terrorizes the remaining crew of the Corbelan, damaging the android Andy and feeding off of its mother Kay before pursuing Rain, but is finally defeated by her jettisoning it into the planetary rings below. Although there is no evidence that the Offspring possesses higher thinking, it smiles when in an advantageous position.

<text>The Long Beach Naval Shipyard (Long Beach NSY or LBNSY), which closed in 1997, was located on Terminal Island between the city of Long Beach and the San Pedro district of Los Angeles, approximately 23 miles south of the Los Angeles International Airport. The primary role of NSY Long Beach at the time of its closure was overhaul and maintenance of conventionally-powered US Navy surface ships, but it also had served as the homeport for several auxiliary ships during its operating history.

==LBNSY description==

The Long Beach NSY industrial area encompassed of the total owned. There were 120 permanent, 39 semi-permanent, and 6 temporary buildings, for a total of 165 buildings. There were 17 different shop work areas and of covered building space. The shipyard had three graving docks, and five industrial piers. There were (measured linearly) of ship berthing space. Crane capacity ranged from to (portal) and from to (floating).
One of the large cranes at Long Beach NSY, &quot;YD-171&quot;, was nicknamed &quot;Herman the German&quot; based on its origin as a floating crane for the Kriegsmarine (one of four ships in the class). It is a large self-propelled crane standing tall with a lifting capacity of , and was claimed to be the largest floating crane in operation as of 1957. &quot;Herman the German&quot; was seized as a war prize following the end of World War II. &quot;Herman&quot; was dismantled and transported across the Atlantic through the Panama Canal to Long Beach, where it was reassembled and subsequently served at the Long Beach NSY from 1946 to 1996. While serving at Long Beach, it participated in the refurbishment of the battleships USS &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; in the 1980s and lifted the Hughes H-4 (&quot;Spruce Goose&quot;) from its original hangar in Long Beach when it was relocated to its geodesic dome from 1980 to 1982 for tourist display by the Wrather Corporation. Following the closure of the shipyard, the crane was sold to the Panama Canal Commission and was transported on the semi-submersible ship &quot;Sea Swan&quot; (IMO 8001000) to the Panama Canal Zone, where it currently serves as the floating crane &quot;Titan&quot;.

Dry Dock 1 had plan dimensions of , and Dry Docks 2 and 3 had plan dimensions of .

The total naval presence on Terminal Island included two installations (Long Beach Naval Shipyard, and Long Beach Naval Station, ), for a total of on Terminal Island and of off-base housing. Half to two-thirds of the area of the finished NSY was built on new fill, so structures were supported on piles.

==Dry Docks==
==History==
Navy presence on Terminal Island started in 1938. The Terminal Island Naval Dry Docks were authorized in June 1940, and construction began in August 1940 on one large drydock and two smaller docks. Recreation facilities, personnel and shop buildings were ordered in February 1942, and work began on Drydocks 2 and 3 and several piers in April 1942. On 9 February 1943, the Secretary of the Navy established the facilities as the US Naval Dry Docks, Roosevelt Base, California. Also in 1943, a barrack for Marines was built, work began on another approach pier, a drydock crane was erected, and several shop buildings were started. In 1944, work started on the pontoons destined to be used in a &quot;temporary&quot; bridge to Terminal Island. The pontoon bridge would not be removed until the opening of the Gerald Desmond Bridge in 1968. The name of this facility was changed to Terminal Island Naval Shipyard on 30 November 1945. On 15 November 1946, the adjoining Naval Station Long Beach was established. The shipyard was renamed Long Beach Naval Shipyard (NSY) in March 1948.

During World War II, the naval dry docks provided routine and battle damage repairs to a parade of tankers, cargo ships, troop transports, destroyers, and cruisers. Peak employment of 16,091 civilian employees was reached in August 1945.

Long Beach NSY was equipped with facilities and skills to perform all non-nuclear structural, sheet metal, boiler, rigging, electronics, electrical, insulating, lagging, ordnance, sandblasting, welding, machining, woodworking, painting, pipe fitting, and other work pertaining to the overhaul and repair of surface ships. The shipyard possessed complete design, engineering, combat systems, quality assurance, planning and public works capabilities to support its industrial work. Dry dock No. 1 was designated the West Coast nuclear powered aircraft carrier (CVN) emergency dry dock.

Long Beach NSY was placed in an inactive status on 1 June 1950. The Korean War began less than one month later, and the shipyard was reactivated on 4 January 1951.

Through the years the shipyard accomplished several special projects in addition to its primary mission. These included support or scientific projects in conjunction with programs like POLARIS, POSEIDON, and SEALAB.


===Closure===

Long Beach NSY was evaluated under every round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) for possible closure since the inception of the BRAC process in 1988. In 1993, California congressmen Horn and Rohrabacher cited the military value of the shipyard in a successful attempt to keep it open. Mare Island NSY was closed following the 1993 evaluations, and the vote in favor of keeping LBNSY open was narrowly decided by the BRAC Commission chairman&#x27;s tiebreaking vote.

However, two years later, the naval shipyard was recommended for closure in the 1995 round of BRAC evaluations (BRAC IV) by then-Defense Secretary William Perry. Although the commission toured Long Beach NSY in April 1995, the BRAC Commission elected not to override the recommendation to close Long Beach NSY, and closure was completed on 30 September 1997. By 2004, 72% of the land had been turned over to the City of Long Beach by the military.

The shipyard appears in a 1995 episode of &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot;.

===Civilian use===

In 1997, COSCO (The China Ocean Shipping Company) wanted to lease the space from the City, including building a $400 million cargo terminal. It was opposed by Rush Limbaugh, as the company was owned by the Communist run People&#x27;s Republic of China, and was being reviewed for national security by the Department of Defense.

After review by the DoD and CIA, the lease went through, at an agreed-upon payment of $14.5 million per year from the Chinese, with renewal scheduled after ten years. However, continued controversy and opposition by Republican lawmakers caused cancellation of the lease, and the new cargo terminal, which was in fact built by the Long Beach Harbor Department (Port of Long Beach), was leased to Hanjin Shipping, a South Korean firm. Hanjin was the majority partner in Total Terminals International (TTI), which was the primary tenant at Pier T until the financial collapse of Hanjin in August 2016. Hanjin entered talks to sell its stake in the Long Beach Terminal to its minority partner in TTI, Mediterranean Shipping Company in October 2016.

==Pacific Reserve Fleet, Long Beach==
Pacific Reserve Fleet, Long Beach was opened at Long Beach Naval Shipyard for use as part of the United States Navy reserve fleets, also called a &quot;mothball fleet&quot;. The Pacific Reserve Fleet, Long Beach was used to store the now many surplus ships after World War II. Some ships in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Long Beach were reactivated for the Korean War and Vietnam War. At its closing the ships stored at Pacific Reserve Fleet, Long Beach were either scrapped or moved to other reserve fleets. Three ships reactivated for the Korean War were three minesweepers on March 1, 1952 the: USS Competent (AM-316), USS Gladiator (AM-319) and USS Devastator (AM-318). USS Bucyrus Victory (AK-234) was placed in the fleet in August 1969 and sold for scrapping the same year. The USS Isle Royale (AD-29) was laid in the fleet and used as the headquarters of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Long Beach, in June 1962 she was put back in service for the Vietnam War.

<text>Thomas Flamank (died 27 June 1497) was a lawyer and former MP from Cornwall, who together with Michael An Gof led the Cornish rebellion of 1497, a protest against taxes imposed by Henry VII of England.

==Ancestry==
He was the eldest son of Richard Flamank or Flammock of Boscarne, by Johanna or Jane, daughter of Thomas Lucombe of Bodmin, and older brother of John Flamank, MP for Bodmin in 1515. Thomas Flamank himself had been MP for Bodmin in 1492. The family is of great antiquity at Bodmin, having held the manor of Nanstallon in uninterrupted succession from the fourteenth to the nineteenth century (1817). In early times the name appeared as Flandrensis, Flemang, Flammank, and in other forms Thomas Flamank married Elizabeth, daughter of John Trelawny of Menwynick, and had a daughter Joanna, wife of Peter Fauntleroy.

==Life==
In 1497 Henry VII was attempting to raise a subsidy in Cornwall for the despatch of an army to Scotland to punish James IV for supporting Perkin Warbeck. Michael Joseph, a blacksmith, was chosen by the people of St. Keverne to challenge the tax. When he and his followers reached Bodmin, they were joined by Thomas Flamank, whose father was one of the commissioners appointed to supervise the tax collection. Flamank argued that it was the business of the barons of the north, and of no other of the king&#x27;s subjects, to defend the Scottish border, and that the tax was illegal. He suggested that the Cornishmen should march on London and present a petition to the king setting forth their grievances, and urging the punishment of Archbishop Morton and Sir Reginald Bray, and other advisers of the king who were held responsible for his action.

As the Cornishmen proceeded into Devon, they were joined by others sympathetic to their cause. At Wells, James Tuchet, 7th Baron Audley, joined them and undertook the leadership. They marched towards London by way of Salisbury and Winchester. London was panic-stricken; but the rebels had grown disheartened by the lack of support shown them in their long march. Giles Daubeny, 8th Baron Daubeny, was directed to take the field with the forces which had been summoned for service in Scotland, a force numbering about 8,000 men.

By 16 June 1497, the Cornish army of about 9,000 had arrived at Blackheath. Daubeny was joined by the king and some of the nobles and gentry from nearby counties. The next morning battle was joined at Deptford Strand. After a fierce skirmish, Daubeny took Deptford Bridge and he and his troops moved onto the Heath. Daubeny, outdistancing his men, was taken prisoner, but soon released. Fighting continued and the Cornish found themselves surrounded. Although they fought bravely, they were a mob without artillery or cavalry against a trained and well-equipped army. The Cornish were soon put to flight.

Audley was beheaded at Tower Hill. Flamank and Joseph were hanged and beheaded at Tyburn (27 June), and their limbs exhibited in various parts of the city. Most of their followers were pardoned.

As noted in the above-mentioned vernacular history of the Cornish, when faced with being sentenced to death Thomas Flamank is recorded as having uttered the last words &quot;Speak the Truth and only then can you be free of your chains&quot;.

==Family and descendants==
He married Elizabeth Trelawny and had the following issue-

* Joan Flamank, m. Peter Fauntleroy

==Legacy==

In 1997, the five-hundredth anniversary of the Rebellion, a commemorative march (&quot;Keskerdh Kernow 500&quot;) was held, retracing the route of the original march from St. Keverne in Cornwall to London. A statue depicting An Gof and Flamank was unveiled in St. Keverne and a commemorative plaque was unveiled on Blackheath Common, and another, en route, at Guildford at the location of a preliminary skirmish.

Flamank, played by John Castle, appeared as a character in the ninth episode of the 1972 BBC television series &quot;The Shadow of the Tower&quot;, which focused on the reign of Henry VII.

<text>The hydrogen line, 21 centimeter line, or H I line is a spectral line that is created by a change in the energy state of solitary, electrically neutral hydrogen atoms. It is produced by a spin-flip transition, which means the direction of the electron&#x27;s spin is reversed relative to the spin of the proton. This is a quantum state change between the two hyperfine levels of the hydrogen 1 s ground state. The electromagnetic radiation producing this line has a frequency of (1.42 GHz), which is equivalent to a wavelength of in a vacuum. According to the Planck–Einstein relation , the photon emitted by this transition has an energy of []. The constant of proportionality, , is known as the Planck constant.

The hydrogen line frequency lies in the L band, which is located in the lower end of the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is frequently observed in radio astronomy because those radio waves can penetrate the large clouds of interstellar cosmic dust that are opaque to visible light. The existence of this line was predicted by Dutch astronomer H. van de Hulst in 1944, then directly observed by E. M. Purcell and his student H. E. Ewen in 1951. Observations of the hydrogen line have been used to reveal the spiral shape of the Milky Way, to calculate the mass and dynamics of individual galaxies, and to test for changes to the fine-structure constant over time. It is of particular importance to cosmology because it can be used to study the early Universe. Due to its fundamental properties, this line is of interest in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. This line is the theoretical basis of the hydrogen maser.

==Cause==

An atom of neutral hydrogen consists of an electron bound to a proton. The lowest stationary energy state of the bound electron is called its ground state. Both the electron and the proton have intrinsic magnetic dipole moments ascribed to their spin, whose interaction results in a slight increase in energy when the spins are parallel, and a decrease when antiparallel. The fact that only parallel and antiparallel states are allowed is a result of the quantum mechanical discretization of the total angular momentum of the system. When the spins are parallel, the magnetic dipole moments are antiparallel (because the electron and proton have opposite charge), thus one would expect this configuration to actually have &quot;lower energy&quot; just as two magnets will align so that the north pole of one is closest to the south pole of the other. This logic fails here because the wave functions of the electron and the proton overlap; that is, the electron is not spatially displaced from the proton, but encompasses it. The magnetic dipole moments are therefore best thought of as tiny current loops. As parallel currents attract, the parallel magnetic dipole moments (i.e., antiparallel spins) have lower energy.

In the ground state, the spin-flip transition between these aligned states has an energy difference of . When applied to the Planck relation, this gives:

:formula_1

where is the wavelength of an emitted photon, is its frequency, is the photon energy, is the Planck constant, and is the speed of light in a vacuum. In a laboratory setting, the hydrogen line parameters have been more precisely measured as:
: &quot;λ&quot; = 
: &quot;ν&quot; = 
in a vacuum.

This transition is highly forbidden with an extremely small transition rate of , and a mean lifetime of the excited state of around 11 million years. Collisions of neutral hydrogen atoms with electrons or other atoms can help promote the emission of 21 cm photons. A spontaneous occurrence of the transition is unlikely to be seen in a laboratory on Earth, but it can be artificially induced through stimulated emission using a hydrogen maser. It is commonly observed in astronomical settings such as hydrogen clouds in our galaxy and others. Because of the uncertainty principle, its long lifetime gives the spectral line an extremely small natural width, so most broadening is due to Doppler shifts caused by bulk motion or nonzero temperature of the emitting regions.

==Discovery==

During the 1930s, it was noticed that there was a radio &quot;hiss&quot; that varied on a daily cycle and appeared to be extraterrestrial in origin. After initial suggestions that this was due to the Sun, it was observed that the radio waves seemed to propagate from the centre of the Galaxy. These discoveries were published in 1940 and were noted by Jan Oort who knew that significant advances could be made in astronomy if there were emission lines in the radio part of the spectrum. He referred this to Hendrik van de Hulst who, in 1944, predicted that neutral hydrogen could produce radiation at a frequency of due to two closely spaced energy levels in the ground state of the hydrogen atom.

The 21 cm line (1420.4 MHz) was first detected in 1951 by Ewen and Purcell at Harvard University, and published after their data was corroborated by Dutch astronomers Muller and Oort, and by Christiansen and Hindman in Australia. After 1952 the first maps of the neutral hydrogen in the Galaxy were made, and revealed for the first time the spiral structure of the Milky Way.

==Uses==
===In radio astronomy===
The 21 cm spectral line appears within the radio spectrum (in the L band of the UHF band of the microwave window to be exact). Electromagnetic energy in this range can easily pass through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and be observed from the Earth with little interference. The hydrogen line can readily penetrate clouds of interstellar cosmic dust that are opaque to visible light. Assuming that the hydrogen atoms are uniformly distributed throughout the galaxy, each line of sight through the galaxy will reveal a hydrogen line. The only difference between each of these lines is the Doppler shift that each of these lines has. Hence, by assuming circular motion, one can calculate the relative speed of each arm of our galaxy. The rotation curve of our galaxy has been calculated using the hydrogen line. It is then possible to use the plot of the rotation curve and the velocity to determine the distance to a certain point within the galaxy. However, a limitation of this method is that departures from circular motion are observed at various scales.

Hydrogen line observations have been used indirectly to calculate the mass of galaxies, to put limits on any changes over time of the fine-structure constant, and to study the dynamics of individual galaxies. The magnetic field strength of interstellar space can be measured by observing the Zeeman effect on the 21-cm line; a task that was first accomplished by G. L. Verschuur in 1968. In theory, it may be possible to search for antihydrogen atoms by measuring the polarization of the 21-cm line in an external magnetic field.

Deuterium has a similar hyperfine spectral line at 91.6 cm (327 MHz), and the relative strength of the 21 cm line to the 91.6 cm line can be used to measure the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio. One group in 2007 reported D/H ratio in the galactic anticenter to be 21 ± 7 parts per million.

===In cosmology===
The line is of great interest in Big Bang cosmology because it is the only known way to probe the cosmological &quot;dark ages&quot; from recombination (when stable hydrogen atoms first formed) to the reionization epoch. After including the redshift range for this period, this line will be observed at frequencies from 200 MHz to about 15 MHz on Earth. It potentially has two applications. First, by mapping the intensity of redshifted 21 centimeter radiation it can, in principle, provide a very precise picture of the matter power spectrum in the period after recombination. Second, it can provide a picture of how the universe was re‑ionized, as neutral hydrogen which has been ionized by radiation from stars or quasars will appear as holes in the 21 cm background.

However, 21 cm observations are very difficult to make. Ground-based experiments to observe the faint signal are plagued by interference from television transmitters and the ionosphere, so they must be made from very secluded sites with care taken to eliminate interference. Space based experiments, even on the far side of the Moon (where they would be sheltered from interference from terrestrial radio signals), have been proposed to compensate for this. Little is known about other foreground effects, such as synchrotron emission and free–free emission on the galaxy. Despite these problems, 21 cm observations, along with space-based gravitational wave observations, are generally viewed as the next great frontier in observational cosmology, after the cosmic microwave background polarization.

===Relevance to the search for non-human intelligent life===
The Pioneer plaque, attached to the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft, portrays the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen and used the wavelength as a standard scale of measurement. For example, the height of the woman in the image is displayed as eight times 21 cm, or 168 cm. Similarly the frequency of the hydrogen spin-flip transition was used for a unit of time in a map to Earth included on the Pioneer plaques and also the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes. On this map, the position of the Sun is portrayed relative to 14 pulsars whose rotation period circa 1977 is given as a multiple of the frequency of the hydrogen spin-flip transition. It is theorized by the plaque&#x27;s creators that an advanced civilization would then be able to use the locations of these pulsars to locate the Solar System at the time the spacecraft were launched.

The 21 cm hydrogen line is considered a favorable frequency by the SETI program in their search for signals from potential extraterrestrial civilizations. In 1959, Italian physicist Giuseppe Cocconi and American physicist Philip Morrison published &quot;Searching for interstellar communications&quot;, a paper proposing the 21 cm hydrogen line and the potential of microwaves in the search for interstellar communications. According to George Basalla, the paper by Cocconi and Morrison &quot;provided a reasonable theoretical basis&quot; for the then-nascent SETI program. Similarly, Pyotr Makovetsky proposed SETI use a frequency which is equal to either

or
:2 × ≈ 

Since  is an irrational number, such a frequency could not possibly be produced in a natural way as a harmonic, and would clearly signify its artificial origin. Such a signal would not be overwhelmed by the H I line itself, or by any of its harmonics.

<doc id="612480" wikidata="Q3248904" url="?curid=612480" title="St Keverne">
<text>St Keverne () is a civil parish and village on The Lizard in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.

In addition to the parish, an electoral ward exists called &quot;St Keverne and Meneage&quot;. This stretches to the western Lizard coast at Gunwalloe. The population of the ward at the 2011 election was 5,220.

The Cornish rebellion of 1497 started in St Keverne. The leader of the rebellion Michael An Gof (&quot;the smith&quot; in Cornish) was a blacksmith from St Keverne and is commemorated by a statue in the village. Before his execution, An Gof said that he should have &quot;a name perpetual and a fame permanent and immortal&quot;. In 1997 a 500th anniversary march, &quot;Keskerdh Kernow 500&quot;, celebrating the rebellion, retraced the route of the original march from St Keverne, via Guildford to London.

== Geography ==
The parish is a large one. It includes some 10 miles of coast from Nare Point at the mouth of the Helford River to Kennack Sands, and the Manacles offshore. Settlements on the coast include Porthallow, Porthoustock and Coverack. Inland the parish includes the hamlets of Zoar, Laddenvean, Traboe, Trelan and Gwenter. The eastern part of Goonhilly Downs is also in the parish.

St Keverne lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

==Parish Church of St Akeveranus==
St Keverne was, in the Middle Ages, the site of an important monastery. The church is dedicated to St Akeveranus, although for a considerable period this was corrupted to Kieran; the form Keverne was revived at the Reformation.

The church is very large for a village church and in its present form is 15th-century: however parts of the stonework appear to have been reused from a previous church building. Unusually for Cornwall, the tower is topped by a spire. Other features of interest include the bench ends and a mural painting.

A 32-pounder carronade that divers recovered in 1978 from the wreck of HMS &quot;Primose&quot; stands by the lych-gate to the churchyard. (&quot;Primrose&quot; was wrecked on The Manacles off The Lizard on 21 January 1809 with the loss of 125 lives and only one survivor, a drummer boy.)

The peal of ten bells is one of the largest two peals in a Cornish parish church; until 2001 St Keverne had eight bells to which two more were then added (Carbis Bay already had a peal of ten).

==History and antiquities==
St. Keverne has been inhabited for many thousands of years, and there is evidence of human habitation from at least the Mesolithic period, c. 5550 BC. The area is rich in archaeological history from a variety of different periods, including flints, pottery, cists, round houses, and cliff castles.

===Prehistory===
The Mesolithic&lt;br&gt;
In 1967, A Mesolithic site known as Rock Mound was discovered at Poldowrian Site, which is situated near the Lankidden Cliff Castle. The Mesolithic site was dated between 5,550 and 5250 BC, from some hazelnut fragments. Flint tools were first discovered during attempts to plow the land for planting, and overall, nearly 48,000 flint tools were discovered.

Neolithic&lt;br&gt; 
During the Neolithic period and beyond, St. Keverne was one of the primary sources of clay for pottery. Gabbroic clay covers an area of approximately 7 square miles of the Lizard Peninsula, mainly in the area of St. Keverne Parish. The clay lies at a depth of 8 – 18 inches below the topsoil. In the late 1960s, Dr. D. Peacock examined numerous potsherds from around Cornwall, and came to the conclusion that they were all made from the same gabbroic clay from St. Keverne. Most of the paleolithic pottery from around Cornwall has been found to be made of gabbroic clay, such as the sherds at the Neolithic site of Carn Brea at Redruth.

Beaker Pottery&lt;br&gt; 
St. Keverne has yielded an exceptional amount of Beaker pottery. The Beaker Mound at Poldowrian has yielded one of the finest caches of Beaker pottery in Cornwall.

Bronze Age&lt;br&gt; 

Goonhilly Downs contains over 65 Bronze Age barrows, as well as the &quot;dry tree&quot; standing stone. A Bronze Age standing stone exists at Tremenheere, which means &quot;Standing Stone Farm&quot; (&quot;Tre&quot; = place/farm, &quot;Menhir&quot; = standing stone) and there is another place of the same name in Ludgvan. Other antiquities are a cist called the Three Brothers of Grugith on Crowza Downs and a destroyed fogou at Polkernogo.

Iron Age&lt;br&gt;
St. Keverne has a number of Iron Age sites, with two of the most dramatic being the cliff castles of Chynalls and Lankidden. All that is left in these sites are the faint markings of the ditches and banks that would have protected these castles, but during the Iron Age they would have provided a &quot;prominent focus within a landscape quite densely populated by contemporary settlements or &quot;rounds.&quot;&quot; Another notable Iron Age artefact originating in St. Keverne is the elaborately engraved bronze mirror discovered in a cist grave, in 1833. This mirror was accompanied by two brooches, some beads, and two rings.

===Middle Ages===
St Keverne was in Celtic times part of the Meneage which belonged to several small monasteries. The monastery at St Keverne survived the Norman Conquest but was seized soon after by a lay lord. (According to the Geld Inquest of 1083 the canons of St Achebranus held one hide in the hundred of Winningtone (i.e. Kerrier) that never paid geld.)

The Condura and Tregarne manors in St Keverne parish were associated with Condura, the Cornish Earl of Cornwall at the time of the Norman Conquest, according to antiquary William Hals.

By 1236 the churches and demesnes of Tregonan had come into the possession of the Cistercian abbey at Beaulieu and their title was confirmed by Richard, Earl of Cornwall in 1258. This was a valuable possession including as it did the rectorial tithe of a large and prosperous parish, the tithe of fish, and the lands of the churchtown. The right of sanctuary held by Beaulieu Abbey was extended to St Keverne. A small cell of monks was maintained at Tregonan; slight remains of the building there existed until the early 20th century. In the parish is Lesneague which can be derived from Cornish &quot;lis&quot; (court) and &quot;manahec&quot; (monks&#x27; land) which would indicate that it was once the seat of a local chieftain.

==Cornish wrestling==
There have been Cornish wrestling tournaments in St Keverne for prizes.
James Polkinghorne (1788–1851) was born at St Keverne and was one of the most famous champion Cornish wrestlers who had a number of famous contests against Devon fighters, including Flower, Jackman (1816) and Abraham Cann (1826), which drew very large crowds of spectators (c17,000).

Henry Cuttance (1807–?), from St Keverne, was a champion Cornish wrestler who the initiator in rallying the local people to assist in the rescue of the crew of the Norwegian schooner, the Elizabeth of Bergen, when it ran aground in 1846.

<text>were crewed torpedoes and suicide craft, used by the Imperial Japanese Navy in the final stages of World War II.

==Background==
In recognition of the unfavorable progress of the war, towards the end of 1943 the Japanese high command considered suggestions for various suicide craft. These suggestions were initially rejected, but later deemed necessary. Various suicide craft were developed in the Japanese Special Attack Units.

For the Navy, this meant &quot;Kamikaze&quot; planes, &quot;Ohka&quot; piloted bombs, &quot;Shinyo&quot; suicide boats, &quot;Kaiten&quot; submarines, and &quot;Fukuryu&quot; suicide divers or human mines. The &quot;Kamikazes&quot; were somewhat successful, and the second most successful were the &quot;Kaitens&quot;.

Research on the first Kaiten began in February 1944, followed on 25 July of the same year by the first prototype. By 1 August, an order for 100 units had been placed.

==Development==
The very first Kaiten was nothing much more than a Type 93 torpedo engine compartment attached to a cylinder that would become the pilot&#x27;s compartment with trimming ballast in place of the warhead and other electronics and hydraulics. The torpedo&#x27;s pneumatic gyroscope was replaced by an electric model, and controls were installed which gave the pilot full control of the weapon.

The original designers and testers of this new weapon were Lieutenant Hiroshi Kuroki and Lieutenant Sekio Nishina. They both died at the controls of Kaiten, Lieutenant Kuroki in a very early training prototype.

In total six models of Kaiten were designed, Types 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 were based on the Type 93 torpedo. Type 10 was the only model based on the Type 92 torpedo. Types 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10 were only manufactured as prototypes and never used in combat.

Early designs allowed the pilot to escape after the final acceleration towards the target. There is no record of any pilot attempting to escape or intending to do so, and this provision was dropped from later Kaiten, so that, once inside, the pilot could not unlock the hatches. The Kaiten was fitted with a self-destruct control, intended for use if an attack failed or the impact fuze failed.

==Pilots==
The island of Ōzushima, in the Inland Sea, was used as a training site. The island was equipped with cranes, torpedo testing pits, and launch ramps, and had a large shallow bay for test running and firing. The Kaiten Memorial Museum is now situated there.

Kaiten pilots were all men aged between 17 and 28. Initial training consisted of sailing fast surface boats by periscope and instrument readings alone. When a pilot had advanced past this basic training, he would begin training on Kaitens. Training craft were fitted with a dummy warhead that contained telemetry equipment and an emergency blowing tank that could return the craft to the surface should the trainee dive to a dangerous depth. Kaiten training started with basic circular runs to and from a fixed landmark at a reduced speed; the training advanced to faster and more hazardous runs around rocks and through channels in deeper waters. The more difficult runs required the pilot to surface and check the periscope repeatedly, and required conscientious adjusting of trim tank levels because of the reducing weight as oxygen was used up. When the instructors were confident about a pilot&#x27;s abilities, they would advance the pilot to open water training against target ships. Training at this level was often done at full attack speed, and either at night or in twilight. The final phase of training would be a submarine launch and more open water attack runs on target ships.

Training was dangerous, and 15 men died in accidents, most commonly collisions with the target vessels. Although the warheads were only dummies, the impact at ramming speed was enough to both cripple the Kaiten and severely injure the pilot.

In action, the Kaiten was always operated by one man, but the larger training models (Types 2, 4, and 5) could carry two or even four.

Kaiten pilots who were leaving for their final missions would leave testaments and messages behind for their loved ones.

==Deployment==
Kaiten were designed to be launched from the deck of a submarine or surface ship, or from coastal installations as a coastal defense weapon. The cruiser &quot;Kitakami&quot; was equipped to launch eight Kaiten and took part in sea launch trials of Type 1s. In addition, two destroyers of the &quot;Minekaze&quot;-class were converted to Kaiten carriers. &quot;Shiokaze&quot; could carry four, and &quot;Namikaze&quot; two. Twelve destroyers of the &quot;Matsu&quot;-class were to follow with capacity for one Kaiten, however only one, &quot;Take&quot;, was completed.

In practice, only the Type 1 craft, using the submarine delivery method, were ever used in combat. Twenty-one specially equipped submarines carried two, four, five, or six Kaiten, depending on their class. The Kaiten were lashed to the host vessel on wooden blocks with a narrow access tube connecting the submarine to the lower hatch of the Kaiten. This allowed the Kaiten crew to enter from the host submarine while submerged.
Kaiten had a very limited diving depth, which in turn limited the diving depth of the host submarine. This is one of several factors blamed for the very poor survival rate of submarines using them, eight submarines being lost for the sinking of only two enemy ships and damage to several others.

Once the target was acquired and the host submarine was within range, the pilot was briefed, the Kaiten&#x27;s starting air bottles were charged, and the cockpit was ventilated. The pilot then entered the vessel, the gyroscope was programmed with the correct bearing and depth and the pilot was given his final briefing.

The Kaiten separated from the host submarine and headed at speed in the direction fed into the gyroscope. Once within final attack range the Kaiten would surface and the pilot would check his range and bearing via periscope and make any adjustments necessary. He would then submerge to a suitable depth, arm the warhead and proceed on his final attack run. If he missed he could make adjustments and try again. If the mission failed he would detonate his vessel as a last resort.

==Types==
Of the six type classes created, only four were significant enough to be noted by the American technical missions to post-war Japan.

===Type 1===
Only the Type 1, a one-man model with a warhead, was used operationally. Over 300 were built, more than 100 of which were sent on suicide missions.

====General arrangement====
The Type 93 torpedo formed the majority of this model of Kaiten with the only alterations being the warhead yield being increased from and the control planes enlarged and altered to allow both gyroscope and pilot control. Between the torpedo warhead and the engine section is the torpedo compressed air flask, 6 (or 8 in later models) steering air bottles and the forward trim tank, followed by the control area and the pilot&#x27;s seat. In later models the Tetrachloromethane starting air bottle is located in the cockpit and a further smaller trimming tank is supplied for use at initial launch. The engine section is slotted in above the aft trim tank with the joint protected by a sheet metal cowl.

The pilot&#x27;s compartment was entered from below through the lower hatch, which was mated to the host submarine. There was a small hand-operated periscope with a vertical range of about 70 cm, controls to arm and detonate the weapon if the attack failed and steering, velocity and depth controls. Batteries to power the 20,000 rpm gyroscope were located under the pilot&#x27;s seat.

The air was filtered by sodium peroxide stored in the pilot&#x27;s compartment.

The Type 6 Kaiten was a Type 1 with a modified forward air tank.

====Performance====
After initial trials in water, it was decided to have a maximum surface cruising speed and, for technical reasons, a minimum running speed at any depth of and a submerged running trim of 1–3° nose-down.

Several problems were encountered during development and use; the most pressing were major water leaks into the pilot&#x27;s chamber during transport and deep diving, and explosions caused by ingress of water into the torpedo engine. These were never fully eliminated.

===Type 2===
In late 1944, Type 2 prototypes were tested in dry-dock and in controlled submerged conditions; however, they never met a standard satisfactory for open water running.

====General arrangement====
The Type 2 was fueled by diesel fuel oxidized by the product of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine hydrate catalyzed by potassium cuprocyanide; water was also used as a diluent in the combustion cycle. The engine was a custom design specifically created to satisfy the requirements of the Kaiten. It was of a U8 configuration and was in the aft compartment of the vessel. This compartment was open to the sea, with seawater used as coolant. The complete operation of the engine had to be simple for a pilot who was already under immense stress, so it was designed to be controlled by a single lever.

The general construction of the Type 2 is substantially different than that of the Type 1. In the forward part of the vessel is the warhead, followed by the fuel, trimming and 2 steering air tanks. The forward part of the midsection is occupied by the hydrogen peroxide chamber. This cylindrical tank required a complicated construction of welding five ribs evenly spaced around the circumference, then coating the inside of the tank with tin, then asphalt and finally with a thick tin plating. Construction of each tank took on average 2 weeks and the skill required was very high.

Behind the peroxide chamber is the pilot&#x27;s compartment. This is much more complex with more controls than that of the Type 1. From fore to aft controls available to the pilot are: depth control gear, trim tank controls, electric switches, gyroscope, rudder control, engine control lever, gauges for various applications, warhead safety gear, engine starter, fuel flow control, and lights with their respective switches.

In the aft quarter of the vessel is found the battery for the gyroscope and other electronics, the aft trim tanks and 2 hydrazine hydrate containers. These containers are made of steel lined with a rubber bag to prevent sea water (used to force the hydrazine hydrate to the engine) and the hydrazine hydrate from coming into contact with each other. Immediately behind these tanks is an auxiliary water tank, then the engine compartment.

The engine compartment is always completely filled with sea-water, so it only has mechanical components. Immediately after the midsection is the generator, the engine, the reduction gears, and finally the propeller and control planes.

====Performance====
The Type 2 had several improvements over the Type 1. It could stay relatively reliably on course with no pilot input and could withstand depths twice as deep as those of the Type 1.

Many problems were encountered in the design and engineering of the Type 2, mostly relating to the engine. In initial tests, water pressure caused deformation and seizing of the engine; although strengthening was added, the problem was never fully resolved. Once the engine was installed in a prototype Type 2, it was unable to reach the required power rating and this, along with the complexity of the manufacturing process of the Type 2 itself, led to the abandonment of the project.

====Specifications====

* Total weight: 
* Length: 
* Diameter: 
* Warhead 
* Detonation mechanism: Contact, manual electric fuze
* Engine: U8 engine. Wet heater 
* Propellant: Diesel, hydrogen peroxide, hydrazine hydrate, and sea water
* Maximum range: 
* Maximum speed: 
* Maximum operating depth: 
* Number built: 1 prototype (Hiro Naval Arsenal: 1)

===Type 4===

In early 1945, concerned with the slow pace of development and the unreliability of the supply of hydrogen peroxide, the Japanese admiralty decided to pursue another line of Kaiten development. Engineers responsible for Kaiten development were opposed to any new work and wished to continue their efforts on development and production of the Type 1.

In all about fifty Type 4 prototypes were made; however, they never went into full-scale production and were ultimately abandoned.

====General arrangement====
The Type 4 was an attempt to modify the Kaiten Type 2, to be fueled by the same kerosene and oxygen combination as the Type 93, Model 3 torpedo. The dimensions, equipment and engine were all identical to the Type 2 although the arrangement differed in several key areas.

The warhead is identical to the Type 2, although some later models had an access cover at the aft end of the warhead.

The forward end of the forward section contains the air vessels, there are four in this section, one Type 93 torpedo air vessel flanked either side by 2 small trim tanks on the keel and three smaller vessels directly above it. The vessels are held in place simply with wood packing. The smaller air vessels are a proprietary design that took some heavy research to perfect. They are sealed by the pressure of the gas, as the pressure rises, a slackly threaded cap presses up against a sealing ring which is screwed down with another cap, thus making an airtight seal. Directly aft of the air vessels is the fuel tank which is ringed by the main forward trim tanks. The fuel tank is lightly constructed and contains baffles to prevent sloshing. Just behind this are the 4 steering air bottles.

The pilot&#x27;s space is identical to that of the Type 2 (minus hydrogen peroxide specific circuit controls). Immediately behind the pilot are three more of the smaller oxygen cylinders however in some models these are omitted and chairs are placed for training purposes. Between the bulkheads joining this section with the engine section are two Type 93 generators, feeding the same Type 6 engine as in the Type 2 Kaiten.

The Type 5 Kaiten was a Type 4 with a modified forward air vessel.

====Performance====
The first uncrewed test runs of the Type 4 at cruising speed were made in early 1945, and it was noted that oxygen efficiency was very low. The same problem occurred in the first test run with a pilot, with sensor readings indicating a large percentage of unburned oxygen in the exhaust gasses.

The weapon made little progress in development and never exceeded a speed of 40 km/h in open sea trials; this combined with untraceable leaks in the engine and the consequent inefficiency of the propulsion system led to this design being filed as a failure and its eventual abandonment. The fact that by now the Kaiten Type 1 was in mass production was also a factor in the cancellation of the Type 4.

====Specifications====
* Total weight: 
* Length: 
* Diameter: 
* Warhead 
* Detonation mechanism: Contact, manual electric fuze
* Engine: U8 engine. Wet heater 
* Propellant: Kerosene and oxygen
* Maximum range: 
* Maximum speed: 
* Maximum operating depth: 
* Number built: approx. 50 produced

===Type 10===

The abandonment of the Types 2, 4 and their intermediaries, development of higher capacity batteries, abundance of Type 92 torpedoes and the ever-increasing urgency to be able to defend the Japanese mainland led to a change of methodology for the Kaiten design teams. The Type 10 was the result. It was essentially a Type 92 electric torpedo with a pilot chamber in-between the warhead and drive unit.

Over 500 units were ordered to be produced between August and October 1945, however, only around 6 (including prototypes) were ever completed.

====General arrangement====
The Type 10 is significantly smaller than the Type 1 and consequently has a much smaller warhead of . The forward section of the weapon contains the warhead and the manual electric fuze, but no contact detonator unlike other kaiten types. The midsection contains the first set of Type 92 batteries as well as a steering air bottle strapped to the underneath of the weapon. The pilot&#x27;s compartment contains firing, starting and gyroscope starting switches as well as a fixed periscope that could only be rotated but not raised or lowered, the rudder control, trim gauge and a sodium peroxide tin for air purification. The latter part of the weapon contained the remainder of the batteries and a small external steering air bottle. The control planes are identical to the Type 92 torpedo&#x27;s other than having a manually operated rudder fitted.

Unlike all previous Kaitens the Type 10 only had an upper hatch, so it could not be entered from within a host submarine. This reflects the design and operation purpose of the weapon as a land-launched coastal defense weapon.

====Performance====
On paper this model had several advantages over the previous types. Firstly it was very simple to construct and maintain. Because it had no pilot controls other than to start and steer it was not complicated to train pilots to use it. It was powered by electricity and consequently had no issue of weight reduction as the fuel was used up, a problem that had caused headaches for test pilots and combat pilots of all previous models. Unlike other models the engine of the Type 10 could be stopped and even reversed, although this would be of little practical value in a combat situation. Finally, it was very light and small, so it was easily transported to different bases of operation should the need arise.

In practice however, the Type 10 proved to be troublesome. Water leaks into the battery compartments and pilot&#x27;s compartment were commonly reported by test pilots. It was also very cramped and uncomfortable for the pilot. Japan surrendered before full development could finish.

====Deployment plans====
The Type 10 was designed and intended as a coastal defense weapon to counter the expected invasion of the Japanese mainland by Allied troops. On 16 July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Naval command ordered the construction of over 500 Type 10s to be stationed and readied for launch from several existing and new kaiten bases. &quot;Details available in the Deployment section above.&quot;

====Specifications====

* Total weight: 
* Length: 
* Diameter: 
* Warhead 
* Detonation mechanism: Manual electric fuze
* Engine: Electric motor 
* Propellant: 112 (28×4) battery cells producing 54 V at 120 A
* Maximum range: 
* Maximum speed: 
* Maximum operating depth: 
* Number built: 1 prototype and 2 or 6 produced

==Effectiveness==

When compared with the Type 93 torpedo which was surface-vessel–launched, Kaiten had the obvious advantages of having a pilot to guide the weapon, and of being launched from a submerged submarine. Despite these advantages, however, they were not nearly as effective on a one-for-one basis as the highly successful Type 93 torpedo on which they were based. United States sources claim that the only sinkings achieved by Kaiten attacks were the fleet oiler anchored at Ulithi on 20 November 1944, with the loss of 63 men; a small infantry landing craft (LCI-600), with the loss of three men; and the destroyer escort while operating northeast of Cape Engaño on 24 July 1945, with the loss of 113 men.

Contrary to the above, some Japanese sources give much larger numbers of Kaiten successes. Reasons given for this discrepancy are the fact that the submarine launching the Kaiten could only estimate success by listening for the detonation of their weapons, and also that the size of the explosion after the attack on USS &quot;Mississinewa&quot; gave the impression of a much larger number of ships sunk.

American losses attributed to Kaiten attacks came to a total of 187 officers and men. The losses of Kaiten crews and support staff were much higher. In total 106 Kaiten pilots lost their lives (including 15 killed in training accidents and two suicides after the war). In addition to the pilots, 846 men died when eight Japanese submarines carrying Kaiten were sunk, and 156 maintenance and support personnel were also killed. This contrasts markedly with the relative success by kill-ratio of the Kamikaze pilots.

===Deployments===
====First====
The of kaitens was launched against hostile vessels near Ulithi on 20 November 1944. The group consisted of two submarines, and &quot;I-36&quot;, carrying a total of eight Kaiten.

This mission gave the Kaiten their first sinking, , but at the cost of all eight Kaiten pilots. The first Kaiten launched from &quot;I-47&quot; was piloted by Sekio Nishina, one of the original designers of the weapon. He carried with him the ashes of the other creator, Hiroshi Kuroki, who died in a training accident very early in the Kaiten&#x27;s development.

At the same time, submarine &quot;I-37&quot; was sighted and engaged by US ships off of Leyte Island. The boat, together with her Kaiten, was sunk by Hedgehog attack from the destroyer escorts and , resulting in the loss of 117 officers and men.

====Second====
The of Kaiten operation was undertaken on 9 January 1945 against the U.S. anchorage at Hollandia, Ulithi, Manus, Kossol Roads and Apra Harbor.

&quot;I-36&quot; engaged US ships with Kaiten at Ulithi on 12 January 1945. One was destroyed by depth charges from VPB-21 but the others succeeded in damaging (with eight casualties) and sinking an infantry landing craft (USS &quot;LCI(L)-600&quot;) (with three deaths).

&quot;I-47&quot; launched a further four Kaiten off Hollandia but only succeeded in damaging the Liberty ship SS &quot;Pontus H. Ros&quot;.

At Ulithi was sunk by . None of the 122 men aboard survived.

&quot;I-53&quot; succeeded in launching her four Kaitens off Kossol Roads, but only two traveled any distance and none reached their targets.

 failed to even reach the launching areas for her Kaitens (Manus) and returned home without firing a single shot.

 launched all four Kaiten off Apra Harbor, of which one exploded immediately after launch. Sometime after deployment, pillars of smoke were seen in the distance along their general bearing.

====Third====
The departed on 20 February 1945 for Iwo Jima.

 was sighted and hunted for over two days underwater; crew compartment carbon dioxide saturation reached 6% before she managed to escape.

 was detected and attacked by a Grumman TBF Avenger on approaching Iwo Jima on 26 February and was sunk by Mark 24 Mines with the loss of all 85 hands.

 was detected and attacked by on 26 February. After an initial hedgehog and depth charge run a final depth charge run was commenced and shortly after small explosions and bubbles were observed. &quot;I-370&quot; was lost with all 84 officers and men aboard as well as all &quot;kaitens&quot; and their pilots.

====Fourth====
The was originally intended to supplement the previous attacks on Iwo Jima and launched on 1 March 1945. &quot;I-58&quot; and &quot;I-36&quot; were within a day of reaching Iwo Jima when they were recalled for a new operation. Both returned home safely.

====Fifth====
The consisted of &quot;I-44&quot;, &quot;I-47&quot;, &quot;I-56&quot; and &quot;I-58&quot; and was to attack the US anchorage at Okinawa. It sailed on 28 March 1945.

On 29 March &quot;I-47&quot; was attacked by a squadron of Grumman TBF Avengers and forced to dive. She was pursued for several hours until she had to surface. On surfacing she was hit by shrapnel which damaged the periscope and fuel tanks. She was forced to limp home for repairs.

&quot;I-56&quot; was detected on approaching Okinawa and hunted by the light carrier and destroyers , , , and . Heavy depth charging by aircraft from the carrier and the latter three destroyers sank her with all 122 hands on board.

&quot;I-58&quot; was hounded by aircraft and anti-submarine fire and arrived at her destination late. She returned without engaging the enemy.

&quot;I-44&quot;&#x27;s location and actions are unknown for the entirety of the mission. A submarine likely to be &quot;I-44&quot; was attacked in the vicinity of Okinawa on 29 April by an aircraft from . The submarine was hit first by a depth charge and finally by a Mark 24 mine. All 129 hands were lost.

====Sixth====
The consisted of &quot;I-47&quot; and &quot;I-36&quot;. They were to attack cargo and troop ships between Ulithi and Okinawa. &quot;I-47&quot; sailed on 20 April and &quot;I-36&quot; on 22 April.

On 27 April &quot;I-36&quot; attempted to attack a convoy of 28 US ships with Kaiten, but with no results. Two of the Kaiten could not be launched. While cruising east of Okinawa &quot;I-36&quot; sighted a supply vessel sailing unescorted. The commander attempted to launch Kaiten but failed, and a torpedo attack also failed when the torpedoes detonated prematurely.

On 2 May &quot;I-47&quot; launched two Kaiten against two US ships, and explosions were heard an hour later, after which &quot;I-47&quot; launched one Kaiten at an escort vessel. Later research indicates none of the Kaiten launched were successful and the explosions heard were probably from Kaiten pilots self-destructing or anti-submarine action.

====Seventh====
The consisted solely of and sailed on 5 May 1945 for north-west Saipan. She was damaged by a mine on 6 May and was unable to continue her mission until 17 May. On 27 May &quot;I-367&quot; sighted a four-ship logistics support convoy and launched two Kaiten. At least one was destroyed by gunfire from . The other Kaiten carried suffered mechanical failures and were unable to be launched. &quot;I-367&quot; returned to base safely.

====Eighth====
The of Kaiten-equipped submarines sailed on 24 May to patrol east of Guam.

&quot;I-36&quot; sighted a lone oil tanker on 22 June and opened an attack with her Kaiten, which both failed, and four conventional torpedoes, which exploded early damaging , a landing craft repair ship. On 28 June &quot;I-36&quot; launched a single Kaiten against , which the &quot;Antares&quot; sank with shellfire and called in a nearby destroyer, the USS &quot;Sproston&quot;. After the destroyer arrived and began depth charging, the submarine managed to launch one of the faulty Kaiten. Although the pilot failed to hit the destroyer, his actions helped the host submarine slip away. Further ships later arrived to hunt &quot;I-36&quot;, but she managed to escape with only a minor leak in the forward torpedo room and a damaged rudder. She would not see any further action in the war, and surrendered to the Allies after the official surrender was announced.

On 16 June the US submarine fired two torpedoes at the , both of which missed. On 27 June, a patrolling Lockheed Ventura sighted &quot;I-165&quot; and dropped three Mark 47 depth charges which sank her with her crew of 106.

 was detected by a minesweeper on 26 May, which alerted the aircraft carrier to search for the submarine. Five days later a patrolling Grumman TBF Avenger detected her and launched a volley of rocket fire, following up with a Mark 24 mine as the boat dived, the explosion of which was felt by the crew of away. The crew of 81 were all lost.

On 28 May sighted several ships but was unable to get close enough to launch &quot;kaiten&quot;. On 15 June a convoy was attacked with conventional torpedoes because &quot;kaiten&quot; could not be launched due to heavy weather. &quot;I-363&quot; returned to base safely.

====Ninth====
The was the last Kaiten-equipped group to go into combat. It was a large force consisting of &quot;I-47&quot;, &quot;I-53&quot;, &quot;I-58&quot;, &quot;I-363&quot;, , and &quot;I-367&quot;. They departed on 14 July headed for an area south-east of Okinawa. &quot;I-363&quot; and &quot;I-367&quot; engaged in no further action before the announcement of unconditional surrender and an end to all hostilities.

&quot;I-47&quot; launched a Kaiten at a lone merchant ship on 21 July, but without result. She saw no further action.

=====Sinking of USS &quot;Underhill.&quot;=====
Arguably the most successful attack by Kaiten was that on , a unit of the numerous class of destroyer escorts and at the time of her sinking escorting several cargo ships and troopships. After an Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Mitsubishi Ki-46 (Allied reporting name &quot;Dinah&quot;) reconnaissance plane spotted the convoy, the submarine &quot;I-53&quot;, attached to the &quot;Tamon&quot; group and carrying six Kaiten, was redirected to the expected location of the convoy.

The submarine launched a decoy mine ahead of the convoy&#x27;s position, causing the convoy to shift bearing to avoid the mine. This, however, was just diversionary and the mine was a dummy. USS &quot;Underhill&quot; after realising this noticed several sonar contacts, which were later revealed to be a Japanese submarine and several Kaiten. A depth charge run was made which did not succeed in killing the submarine although it is suspected that it did succeed in neutralizing one of the Kaiten. The depth charge run was followed by a ramming attempt on a submarine at periscope depth.

As the &quot;Underhill&quot; rammed the surfaced vessel (later revealed to be a Kaiten) it was struck by a second Kaiten waiting in ambush. Both pilots detonated their charges, one of which led to the detonation of the destroyer escort&#x27;s boilers, which led to her being torn in half by the explosions. The sinking resulted in the loss of almost half of her complement, including most of the officers.

One of the attacking Kaiten also attempted an attack on tank landing ship, &quot;LST-991&quot;, but unexplainedly passed under the ship&#x27;s keel. This may have been the same Kaiten which successfully rammed and sank &quot;Underhill&quot;.

Yutaka Yokota, a Kaiten pilot whose three missions were canceled due to mechanical failures, and who wrote a memoir of his Kaiten experiences, witnessed the attack on the &quot;Underhill&quot;.

Following the successful attack on the &quot;Underhill&quot;, &quot;I-53&quot; launched a further Kaiten at an unnamed vessel six days later. The attack was unsuccessful. On 3 August &quot;I-53&quot; was detected by and the destroyer began a series of unsuccessful Hedgehog attacks. &quot;I-53&quot; launched two Kaitens separated by 30 minutes, explosions were heard, and it was confirmed that the destroyer was damaged in the attack. She escaped pursuit and returned home.

&quot;I-58&quot; was patrolling the Guam-Leyte route on 28 July when she was forced to dive by an aircraft. A tanker and a destroyer, , were sighted and the commander decided to attack. Two Kaiten were launched, one of which was sunk by gunfire and the other by ramming, damaging the destroyer slightly in the process. A day later, &quot;I-58&quot; sighted and the commander, Mochitsura Hashimoto ordered two Kaiten prepared for attack. Once in firing range the commander realised it would be a waste of a Kaiten to attack such an easy target, and instead launched a spread of six Type 95 torpedoes, three of which hit, causing the cruiser to sink rapidly. On 9 August &quot;I-58&quot; came across a convoy led by and readied three of her Kaitens to attack, of which only one could be launched. This was followed by another rapidly prepared, and both made for . Although one narrowly missed the destroyer, both were destroyed by gunfire and depth charging. The convoy searched for other submarines, but &quot;I-58&quot; escaped. On 12 August a Kaiten was launched against and her escort . The Kaiten passed under the destroyer, then surfaced and self-detonated. A second object was spotted by the destroyer and depth charges were launched, after which an explosion occurred. Whether this was a Kaiten is unknown, as all six of &quot;I-58&quot;&#x27;s weapons were accounted for, but with two failures, perhaps one was repaired and launched later.

On 11 August &quot;I-366&quot; attacked a convoy north of Palau. The commander attempted to launch all of the Kaiten, but two failed, and the ones that were launched didn&#x27;t score a hit or even explode. Less than a week later, Japan surrendered and all submarines were ordered home, and &quot;I-366&quot; saw no further action.

====Tenth====
The consisting solely of , sailed on 16 August 1945 to attack Soviet convoys in the Sea of Japan. The mission was cancelled by headquarters before any action and &quot;I-159&quot; returned with all of her Kaiten on 18 August 1945.

<text>William Gambel (June 1823 – December 13, 1849) was an American naturalist, ornithologist, and botanist from Philadelphia. As a young man he worked closely with the renowned naturalist Thomas Nuttall. At the age of eighteen he traveled overland to California, becoming the first botanist to collect specimens in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and parts of California.

==Biography==
Gambel was born William Gamble Jr. in Philadelphia in June 1823. His father, William Gamble Sr., had immigrated from Northern Ireland and served in the War of 1812. After the death of his first wife, Gamble Sr. moved to Philadelphia, where he married Elizabeth Gamble in August 1822. They had three children: William and two daughters. Gamble Sr. died of pneumonia in 1832, and Elizabeth Gamble was left to raise the children on her own.

William proved to be a good student, perhaps influenced by his mother, who worked as a school teacher. For unexplained reasons, he began spelling his surname Gambel. In 1838 Gambel met the renowned naturalist Thomas Nuttall, and they quickly became friends. Nuttall had a broad expertise in all aspects of natural history, and through his influence, Gambel developed an affinity for botany, mineralogy, and ornithology. For the next few years Gambel served as a sort of apprentice for Nuttall.

In late 1838, they traveled together on a collecting trip to the Carolinas and the southern Appalachians. They returned to Philadelphia in April 1839 and then quickly set off again for a field trip to New Jersey to study and collect pre-Cambrian limestone minerals. In October 1839, they were back in Philadelphia to attend a meeting of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, where Gambel presented a gold nugget from North Carolina for the museum collection. In February 1840, Gambel accompanied Nuttall to Cambridge, Massachusetts where Nuttall had been invited to present a series of lectures at the Lowell Institute. They also made a couple of field trips to Maine, where they collected mineral specimens. By August 1840, the lecture series had ended and they returned to Philadelphia.

In March 1841, at the age of eighteen, Gambel set off on his own for California to collect plants and other specimens for Nuttall. He planned to take a more southerly route than that taken in 1834 by Nuttall and John Kirk Townsend. Upon reaching Independence, Missouri, he joined a group of traders and headed for Santa Fe, following the Santa Fe Trail. Gambel reached Santa Fe in June and spent the next couple months collecting plants. In September, Gambel joined a party heading to California and accompanied them along the Old Spanish Trail, arriving in Mexican Alta California in early November 1841, becoming the first botanist to enter California overland from the east.

Gambel spent the next year collecting along the coast from Los Angeles up to Monterey. In February 1842, he became the first botanist to collect on Santa Catalina Island off the coast of California. In addition to plants, Gambel collected bird specimens and observed them in their habitat. He later published his observations in &quot;Remarks on birds observed in Upper California, with descriptions of new species&quot; (1847/1849). The new bird species he collected included Gambel&#x27;s quail (&quot;Callipepla gambelii&quot;), mountain chickadee (&quot;Parus gambeli&quot;) and Nuttall&#x27;s woodpecker (&quot;Picoides nuttallii&quot;).

By midsummer, Gambel was out of money and became a clerk on the US Navy ship &quot;Cyane&quot;, commanded by Thomas ap Catesby Jones. For the next three years, Gambel served on several navy ships, visiting Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands, Peru and Chile. In a letter to his mother, Gambel said he had &quot;sailed farther than twice around the world.&quot; In March 1845, his ship left Chile and sailed to the East Coast via Cape Horn. Gambel returned to Philadelphia by July 1845.

While Gambel was in California, Nuttall returned home to England, where he remained for the rest of his life. In Philadelphia, Gambel published some of his zoological findings and sent many of his botanical specimens to Nuttall for publication. In 1845, Gambel entered the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania and received a medical degree in March 1848. He married Catherine Towson, a childhood sweetheart, in October. He also served briefly as the Recording Secretary at the Academy of Natural Sciences.

Gambel soon encountered difficulty in establishing a medical practice in Philadelphia. California was booming because of the Gold Rush and presented an opportunity for a new doctor. He shipped his medical books and equipment by sea and made arrangements for his wife to join him after he became settled. On April 5, 1849, Gambel and an acquaintance, Isaac Wistar, left for the difficult overland journey to California. In Independence, Missouri, they formed a larger party led by Wistar and made good progress westward. However, Gambel grew tired of the group&#x27;s fast pace and joined a slower-moving ox-train led by Captain Boone of Kentucky. Boone offered to relieve Gambel of any camp duties in exchange for his medical services.

The Boone party did not fare well crossing the deserts and mountains of the Great Basin. Most of the livestock and wagons were lost by the time they reached the Sierra Nevada range in October. Early snows were already falling in the high country, but Gambel and a few others pushed on to the western slopes. In December, Gambel reached Rose&#x27;s Bar, a gold mining camp on the Yuba River. The settlement was in the midst of a typhoid epidemic. Gambel tried to treat the ill miners, but he became sick himself and died December 13, 1849. He was buried at the base of a giant ponderosa pine, but the entire site was soon washed away by hydraulic mining.

Animals named in his honor include the Gambel&#x27;s quail and &quot;Gambelia&quot;, the genus of lizards. In 1848, a genus of flowering plants, &quot;Gambelia&quot;, from California and Mexico, was named after him. The common name and specific epithet of Gambel&#x27;s oak, &quot;Quercus gambelii&quot;, honors William Gambel.

<text>Rothwell is a market town in North Northamptonshire, England. It is close to three larger towns, situated 4 miles [6.4km] northwest of Kettering, 7 miles [11km] southeast of Market Harborough and 8 miles [12.8km] southwest of Corby. Rothwell&#x27;s nearest railway station is at Kettering on the Midland Main Line.

== Rothwell – &quot;the place of the red well&quot; ==

The ridge on which present day Rothwell stands, overlooking the gentle Ise Valley, has witnessed the comings and goings of successive generations. Four thousand years ago Bronze Age mourners buried their dead alongside offerings of food in vessels. The Romano-British people, two thousand years later, built a settlement in what is now &quot;Rothwell&quot;. Dark Age invaders came next and founded the Danish settlement of &quot;Rodewell&quot; or &quot;place of the red well&quot;, presumably so-called because of the area&#x27;s many freshwater springs coloured red by iron and other minerals.

There is an alternative explanation for the name however. According to AD Mills the name meant stream or spring by a clearing or clearings in the forest. Mills gives the name as Old English (i.e. Anglo-Saxon) rather than Danish 

By the early Middle Ages Rothwell, or &quot;Rowell&quot; as it is known locally, was already a town of some importance, dominating the then smaller settlement of Kettering (a state of affairs which persisted until the arrival in Kettering of the railway). A charter, granted by King John in AD 1204 permitting a weekly market and annual fair, confirmed the trade. Both a market and a fair are still extant. The market is held every Monday and the fair, called &quot;Rowell Fair&quot;, takes place on Market Hill during the week following Trinity Sunday. Rothwell Market House was completed in 1578.

The town has a rich history and possesses a large parish church, the longest in the county and complete with bone-crypt, and the Market House built by Thomas Tresham in 1578. Rothwell was once one of the three largest towns in Northamptonshire, the other two being Northampton and Stamford (which is now in Lincolnshire). Rothwell is also on the pilgrimage route from the former Benedictine Abbey at Peterborough to Santiago de Compostella, a route still used today.

==&quot;Rowell Fair&quot;==
In 1204 King John issued a royal charter granting Rothwell the right to hold a market every Monday:
&quot;John, by the grace of God King, be it known that we have granted, and by this our present charter do confirm to our beloved and faithful Richard - Earl of Clare and his heirs that they may have their market of Rowell on Monday, with all the liberties and free customs to that market belonging as it was formerly [held] on Sunday, so that nevertheless it be not the hurt of neighbouring markets. Besides which we grant and by this our charter we have confirmed to the same Earl Richard and his heirs, that they may have yearly, a fair at Rowell at the feast of the Holy Trinity for and during the five days, that is to say on the eve of the Holy Trinity and on that day and on three following days, so nevertheless that such fair will not be to the hurt of neighbouring fairs. Wherefore we will and firmly declare that the aforesaid Earl Richard and his heirs may and hold the aforesaid market and the aforesaid fair of us and our heirs in perpetuity well and in peace, freely and quietly, rightly, fully and with honour, with all the liberties and free customs as aforesaid.&quot;
&quot;Witness the Lord H. Archbishop of Canterbury, J Norwich and W. London Bishops etc.&quot;
&quot;Given at Westminster the 26th day of January, in the fifth year&quot;
The granting of the charter is celebrated annually by the week-long Rowell Fair. The fair is opened on the first Monday after Trinity Sunday each year by the Proclamation, which in 2016 took place on 23 May.
Starting at 6am at the west door of Holy Trinity church, the bailiff of the Lord of the Manor rides through the town accompanied by a guard of halberdiers and the Rowell Fair Society Band. At each public house he pauses to read aloud the charter. At the conclusion of each reading the crowd cheers &quot;God save the Queen and the Lord of the Manor&quot; and the band plays the National Anthem. The proprietor of the public house then serves the bailiff and his guards with drinks including the traditional Rowell Fair rum and milk. The local townspeople then attempt to disarm the halberdiers before the party moves on to the next public house.

Pubs in the town traditionally remain open after the proclamation, and so much merriment is to be had all through the morning. It has been suggested, however, that the traditional route for the fair should be moved to avoid town-centre traffic congestion.

==Religion==
=== Holy Trinity Church ===

The church is a Grade I listed building.

Although the south chancel wall, with its corbel table, complete with three round-headed windows date from the 11th century and the west tower dates from the 1170s, most of the church is 13th-century. The tower at one time had a spire, but in 1660 this collapsed, severely damaging the nave.

The church is long, making it the longest church in Northamptonshire.

The church organises events including, in June 2013, a concert by the accordionist John Kirkpatrick.

The church has one of only two known bone crypts or &quot;charnel houses&quot; in the country; it contains the remains of around 1,500 people. The other surviving ossuary is in St Leonard&#x27;s Church in Hythe, Kent. Holy Trinity has seven late 15th-century misericords, along with one from the 1980s, which is a floral decoration in memory of Doris Willcox who died in 1974.

===The United Reformed Church ===

Built in 1735, Rothwell United Reformed Church has a simple facade but has a remarkable interior in a sophisticated classical style. The history of Non-Conformism in Rothwell stretches as far back as 1655, making the town the birthplace of the movement in the English Midlands.

== Ironstone quarrying ==
Rothwell sits in an area rich in iron ore. From 1920 until 1962, ironstone was quarried from large, shallow pits to the south east of the town. These were connected by the steam worked narrow gauge Kettering Ironstone Railway to the ironworks north of Kettering. These quarries began north of the A6 but from 1925 production was focussed on an area bounded roughly by the A6 on the north,Loddingon Road on the west and Thorpe Malsor Reservoir on the south. There was also a quarry near Rothwell Grange on the north side of the A6 which operated between 1923 and 1946 which was connected to the same tramway.The Kettering Ironworks closed in 1959 and after that the ore was smelted at Corby or elsewhere. At first the quarries were worked by hand with the aid of explosives. From 1933 steam and from 1941 a diesel quarrying machine was introduced. The traces of the quarrying include a sunken field near the cemetery. 

There were also quarries to the north of the town. These operated from 1900 to 1926 and again from 1959 to 1967. During the first period the quarries were on both sides of the Desborough Road (operating from 1906 to 1925 on the east side of the road.) During this period the ore was taken by 3 ft. gauge tramway to sidings at the main Leicester to London railway near what was then Desborough and Rothwell Station. At the quarry end there were steam locomotives but to cross the valley between Rothwell and Desborough there was a cable worked section, taking the wagons first down into the valley and then up to the main line. Steam quarrying machines were used from 1911 onwards. During the second period of operation the ore was obtained from the quarry on the west side only of Desborough Road. It was taken first by lorry to just west of the road and from there carried by a five and a quarter mile aerial ropeway to Oakley, thence by tramway to Corby Works for smelting. Two electric (and one diesel) quarrying machines were used during this period. There are traces of these quarries including a gullett (a rock face area) which is now a nature reserve. Also a minor road was diverted. 

==Sport and leisure==
Rothwell has a Non-League football team Rothwell Corinthians F.C. who play at Seargeant&#x27;s Lawn, Desborough Road.

Until the close of the 2011–2012 season, Rothwell had another football club, Rothwell Town F.C. Having been as high up the football pyramid as Southern Football League Premier Division, the team are currently without a home, due to ownership/rent issues at the ground on Cecil Street, close to Rothwell Junior School.

== Twinning ==
Rothwell is twinned with the small French town of Droué, near Blois in central France.

== Schools ==
Rothwell has three schools. Rothwell Victoria Infant School, Rothwell Junior School and Montsaye Academy. Montsaye Academy is a secondary school with a sixth form.

Rothwell Victoria Infant School and Rothwell Junior School are partnered.

<doc id="612490" wikidata="Q134927" url="?curid=612490" title="Mount Emei">
<text>Mount Emei (; ), alternatively Mount Omei, is a mountain in Sichuan Province, China, and is the highest of the Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains of China. Mount Emei sits at the western rim of the Sichuan Basin. The mountains west of it are known as Daxiangling.
A large surrounding area of countryside is geologically known as the Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province, a large igneous province generated by the Emeishan Traps volcanic eruptions during the Permian Period.

Administratively, Mount Emei is located near the county-level city of the same name (Emeishan City), which is in turn part of the prefecture-level city of Leshan. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

== Name ==
Emei means &quot;moth-browed&quot;.

==Relevance to Buddhism==
Chinese people offer burning sandalwood near the mountain to send their &quot;prayers to heaven&quot;.

=== As a sacred mountain ===
Mount Emei is one of the Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains of China, and is traditionally regarded as the bodhimaṇḍa, or place of enlightenment, of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra. Samantabhadra is known in Mandarin as Pǔxián Púsà ().

Sources of the 16th and 17th centuries allude to the practice of martial arts in the monasteries of Mount Emei, which made the earliest extant reference to the Shaolin Monastery as the place of origin of Chinese martial arts.

Chinese Buddhist pilgrims regularly travel to the mountain.

=== Buddhist architecture on Emei ===
This is the location of the first Buddhist temple built in China in the 1st century CE.
The site has seventy-six Buddhist monasteries of the Ming and Qing dynasties, most of them located near the mountain top. The monasteries demonstrate a flexible architectural style that adapts to the landscape. Some, such as the halls of Baoguosi, are built on terraces of varying levels, while others, including the structures of Leiyinsi, are on raised stilts. Here the fixed plans of Buddhist monasteries of earlier periods were modified or ignored in order to make full use of the natural scenery. The buildings of Qingyinge are laid out in an irregular plot on the narrow piece of land between the Black Dragon River and the White Dragon River. The site is large and the winding footpath is long, taking several days to walk.

Cable cars ease the ascent to the two temples at Jinding (3,077 m), an hour&#x27;s hike from the mountain&#x27;s peak.

== Climate ==
The summit of Mount Emei has an alpine subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dwc&quot;), with long, cold (but not severely so) winters, and short, cool summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . Precipitation is common year-round (occurring on more than 250 days), but due to the influence of the monsoon, rainfall is especially heavy in summer, and more than 70% of the annual total occurs from June to September.

==Indigenous animals==
There are nearly 400 total species of animals, invertebrates and plants native to the mountain. There are at least six snake species native to the region, including the Chinese slug snake, Mandarin ratsnake, mountain water snake, Peters&#x27; odd-scaled snake, plus some potently venomous species, such as the Chinese green tree viper, the brown spotted pitviper and the Taiwan mountain pitviper.

Visitors to Mount Emei will likely see dozens of Tibetan macaques, which can often be viewed taking food from tourists. A famously well-fed, one-armed, elderly female macaque named Xing Xing has millions of views on YouTube, seemingly showing the macaques’ complete disdain for the hordes of tourists who are often offering them food directly in their faces. It seems that only one elderly woman who lives on the mountain, and her son, are able to be close to Xing Xing, to feed and pet her. Xing Xing appears to consider the woman her best friend, while shunning the offers of food from strangers. If tourists persist in holding food in the monkeys’ faces, they will aggressively grab at the person’s clothing and stare at them, and not let go. If the person continues to irritate the macaque, they are very easily angered and prone to bite. Still, local merchants sell nuts and other foods for the tourists to attempt to feed the monkeys. 

Other local animals include lizards, such as the Indian forest skink and the lacerta &quot;Takydromus intermedius&quot;, the frogs &quot;Rana adenopleura&quot; and &quot;Vibrissaphora liui&quot;, and a giant, half-metre long earthworm species, &quot;Pheretima praepinguis&quot;.

==Flora==
Mount Emei is known for its high level of endemism and approximately 200 plant species in various plant families have been described from this mountain.

A rare species of Fir tree is endemic to this mountain it is Abies fabri.

<doc id="612494" wikidata="Q769960" url="?curid=612494" title="August Revolution">
<text>The August Revolution (), also known as the August General Uprising (), was a revolution led by the Việt Minh against the Empire of Vietnam from 16 August to 2 September 1945. The Empire of Vietnam was led by the Nguyễn dynasty and was a puppet state of Japan within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Việt Minh, a political league &quot;de facto&quot; led by the Communist Party, was created in 1941 and designed to appeal to a wider population than what the communists could command. The Việt Minh was supported by the US. The revolution had the participation of factions that did not follow the Việt Minh.

The Japanese army in Vietnam did nothing to prevent the revolution as they &quot;de facto&quot; surrendered to the Allies and World War II ended. There was only a sporadic clash in Thái Nguyên with inconclusiveness. Japan still recognized its puppet as the legitimate government of Vietnam but the Empire of Vietnam refused Japan&#x27;s request for help because its prime minister did not want foreign army to suppress the Việt Minh when he supported Vietnamese nationalism and did not discover their communist nature, leading to the revolution happening peacefully. During and after the revolution, the communist Việt Minh had seized control of most of Vietnam, the rest was in the hands of non-communist faction. The Nguyễn dynasty with its puppet government of Trần Trọng Kim collapsed when its emperor Bảo Đại abdicated on 25 August 1945. He was later accepted as an advisor to the government of the Việt Minh and was &quot;elected&quot; a member of its National Assembly, but was later abandoned in China by the communists. The August Revolution sought to create a unified and independent state for Vietnam under the Việt Minh&#x27;s rule. Việt Minh leader Hồ Chí Minh declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) to replace the old Nguyễn dynasty on 2 September 1945, but this government was not recognized as an independent state by French colonialists. No country recognized the DRV while French sovereignty over Indochina was recognized by the Allies. The Việt Minh used its non-communist cover to successfully attract many non-communist nationalists, but there were many other non-communist nationalists who did not accept communist rule. The foundation of the DRV was the first time Vietnam became a republic. However, the return of France and communist monopoly led to the purges of non-communist dissidents and the formation of a rival state of ex-emperor Bảo Đại in 1949 as part of decolonization, a pro-French and anti-communist regime.

== Historical background ==

=== French colonialism ===
==== French colonial rule ====
All of Vietnam was under the French colonial rule from 1883 until the Japanese coup d&#x27;état of March 1945. In 1887, the French created the Indochinese Union including the three separately-ruled territories of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina, which were parts of Vietnam, and the newly acquired Cambodia; Laos was created at a later time. To justify their rule, the French claimed that it was their responsibility to help undeveloped regions in Asia become “civilized.” Without French intervention, they asserted, these places would remain backward, uncultured, and impoverished. In a view based more on solid reality, French imperialism was driven by the demand for resources, namely raw materials and cheap labour.

It is generally agreed that French colonial rule was politically repressive and economically exploitative to the original inhabitants; therefore, the Vietnamese struggle against French colonialism was well established by World War II, being close to a century in progress. Incursions by missionaries, gunboats, and diplomats in the 19th century had set off repeated periods of resistance because of the loyalty of the Vietnamese people to the Nguyễn monarchy and traditional Confucian values, which were completely in conflict with European, notably French, interests. From the beginning of the French occupation of Vietnam, thousands of poorly-armed Vietnamese reacted to foreign control with various rebellions, a major one being the Cần Vương movement (), a large-scale Vietnamese insurgency between 1885 and 1896 against French colonial rule in favour of restoring the de facto, and not just de jure, power of the native dynasty.

In 1917, a band of political prisoners, common criminals and mutinous prison guards seized the Thái Nguyên Penitentiary, the largest penal institution in northern Tonkin. The extraordinary regional and social diversity of its force makes the Thái Nguyên uprising a compelling prequel to the modern nationalist movements of the 1930s. Although all of the rebellions failed without exception, they remained a powerful symbol of resistance and calling to better days in the local population.

====Development of nationalist movements====
During the colonial period, the French (in their quest to civilize the people of South-East Asia) transformed Vietnamese society. Education and national industry were promoted, which had the unintended effect of stimulating the development of nationalist movements.

In the north, the anti-colonial nationalist movement was dominated by communism after Hồ Chí Minh created the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League in 1925. On 3 February 1930, a special conference was held in Hong Kong under the chairmanship of Hồ Chí Minh, and the Vietnamese Communist Party was then born. In October, following a Comintern directive, this name was changed to Indochinese Communist Party (ICP). Until the party was officially disbanded by Hồ Chí Minh in November 1945, it held a leading position in the Vietnamese anti-colonial revolution.

Ho Chi Minh went by many names during his rise to power, including Nguyen Tat Thanh &quot;Nguyen Who Will Be Victorious,&quot; Nguyen O Phap &quot;Nguyen Who Hates the French&quot; and Nguyen Ai Quoc &quot;Nguyen Who Loves His Country&quot;. The changes were used to further his cause of uniting the citizens and encouraging them to rebel. Ho Chi Minh means &quot;Ho Who Aspires To Enlightenment&quot;.

In the south, the anti-colonial nationalist movement was more complicated than in the north due to political divisions. The Cao Đài was the first of southern Vietnam&#x27;s three most influential politico-religious organizations to emerge in the colonial era. Officially founded by colonial civil servant Ngô Văn Chiêu in 1926, it would grow to be the largest of the region&#x27;s politically oriented religious entities, and in many ways the most powerful. More than a decade later, in 1939, Prophet Huynh Phu So introduced another politico-religious organization into southern Vietnam&#x27;s anti-colonial milieu by founding the Hòa Hảo.

His alleged miracle cures, preaching, and carrying out acts of extreme charity for the poor made Prophet Huynh Phu So, by the end of 1939, attract tens of thousands of adherents to the new Hòa Hảo organization. The third politico-religious organization called Bình Xuyên, can be traced back to the early 1920s, but Bình Xuyên did not become a truly organized political force until the end of the Second World War. All three organizations were major anti-colonial powers in southern Vietnam.

In the Saigon region, the Communists also contended with a Trotskyist left opposition. In April 1939, the United Workers and Peasants slate, led by the Trotskyist Tạ Thu Thâu, triumphed over both the Communist Party&#x27;s Democratic Front and the &quot;bourgeois&quot; Constitutionalists in elections to the colonial Cochinchina Council. Governor-General Brévié, who set the results aside, wrote to French Colonial Minister Mandel: &quot;the Trotskyists under the leadership of Ta Thu Thau, want to take advantage of a possible war in order to win total liberation.&quot; The Stalinists, on the other hand, are &quot;following the position of the Communist Party in France&quot; and &quot;will thus be loyal if war breaks out.&quot;

=== World War II and the Japanese occupation ===

==== Japanese occupation and 1945 coup ====
Before 1945, France and Japan had uneasily ruled Vietnam together for over four years.

In September 1940, just months after France capitulated to Germany, Japanese troops took advantage of French weakness to station troops in northern Vietnam for the purpose of cutting off the supply route to the southern flank of the China Theatre. From 1940 to March 1945, the French retained their administrative responsibilities, police duties, and even their colonial army in exchange for allowing Japanese troops and material to pass through Indochina. By 1943, however, there were signs that the Japanese might lose the war. The United States had begun the island-hopping sweep through the South Pacific. A seaborne Allied landing in Indochina and an overland attack from China became real threats to the Japanese. In addition, an upsurge of Gaullist sentiment in Indochina after Charles de Gaulle returned to Paris at the head of the French Provisional Government in September 1944 added to Japanese concerns.

In the evening of 9 March 1945, the Japanese forces attacked the French in every center and removed the French from administrative control of Indochina. In less than 24 hours, the majority of the French armed forces throughout Indochina was put out of combat. The entire French colonial system, which had been in existence for almost 87 years, came tumbling down. Practically all French civil and military leaders were made prisoners, including Admiral Decoux.

After the Japanese removed the French from administrative control in Indochina, they made no attempt to impose their own direct control of the civilian administration. Concerned primarily with the defense of Vietnam against an Allied invasion, the Japanese were not interested in Vietnamese politics although they also understood the desirability of a certain degree of administrative continuity. It was to their advantage to install a Vietnamese government that would acquiesce in the Japanese military presence. With that in mind, the Japanese persuaded the Vietnamese Nguyễn dynasty emperor, Bảo Đại, to co-operate with Japan and to declare Vietnam independent of France. On 11 March 1945, Bảo Đại did just that by abrogating the Franco-Vietnamese Treaty of Protectorate of 1884 (Vietnam became a French colony in 1883). In August, Vietnam regained Cochinchina (Southern Vietnam). Vietnam&#x27;s new &quot;independence,&quot; however, rested on the government&#x27;s willingness to co-operate with Japan and accept the Japanese military presence.

==== Opportunity for Vietnamese nationalists ====
From March to August 1945, Vietnam enjoyed what was essentially &quot;fake independence.&quot; In the aftermath of the coup, the Japanese most definitely wanted to minimize internal change in Indochina, which would have adversely affected their military objectives. The Trần Trọng Kim Cabinet was, from all available evidence, a government only in name and ruled over no state in fact. Indochinese affairs were still in the hands of the Japanese army in the context of war.

If the 9 March coup was a disaster for the French, it was an opportunity for Vietnamese nationalists. In fact, it marked a turning point in the Vietnamese revolution. Freed from French repression, which had continued unabated in the early phase of the Japanese occupation, Vietnamese revolutionaries had much greater freedom of movement.

In May 1941, Hồ Chí Minh formed the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh (League for the Independence of Vietnam), or Việt Minh for short, at the Eighth Plenum of the Indochinese Communist Party at Pác Bó in northern Vietnam. The Việt Minh encouraged the creation of &quot;national salvation associations&quot; and adopted guerrilla warfare as the cornerstone of its revolutionary strategy. After the coup, the Japanese were content to control the large cities and leave the countryside to the Vietnamese. The Việt Minh, in particular, took advantage of the situation to strengthen their power. During the five months of the Japanese interlude, the Việt Minh carried out propaganda activities and organizational work in the Vietnamese countryside to prepare for the anticipated popular insurrection.

However, the Việt Minh was not the only political organization to anticipate an opportunity. In fact, after the brief storm of bullets of 9 March, political parties, groups, and associations were formed throughout Vietnam. In the south, because of the weak status of the communist movement, the Việt Minh failed to take the leadership of the movements during the preparation for insurrection. Several politico-religious organizations mentioned above rapidly expanded their power. In the early of summer 1945, Hòa Hảo leaders opened talks with the heads of other southern nationalist groups in the south, including the Cao Đài and the Trotskyists, to fight for and defend an independent Vietnam when the war ended.

==== Vietnamese famine of 1945 ====
The famine of 1945 was another issue of utmost importance during the Japanese interlude. The famine was caused by both artificial and natural factors.

During the war, the Japanese had forced many rice farmers to grow other crops. As a result, rice production decreased, especially in the north, where crops had often been supplemented in the past by shipments from the south. Now, however, Japanese troops consumed the surplus from the south or converted it to fuel for military vehicles. Terrible flooding in the spring of 1945 added to the misery. Starving peasants flocked to the cities or died passively in the countryside.

The devastation contributed to the crisis of authority in the country. Neither the French nor the Japanese took effective measures to alleviate the famine, and Kim&#x27;s government could do nothing without Japanese consent. The misery and anger combined to foster a new interest in politics, especially among the younger generation, which the Việt Minh turned to its advantage.

During the famine, the Việt Minh conducted raids on Japanese granaries and the rice storage facilities of Vietnamese landlords. In the long run, the Việt Minh thus increased popular support, highlighted the impotency of Kim&#x27;s government and intensified popular feelings against the French and Japanese. The Việt Minh succeeded in creating People&#x27;s Revolutionary Committees all over the north. The committees were to take over local administration when the Việt Minh launched the general insurrection.

== August Revolution ==

When the Japanese surrendered to the Allies on 15 August 1945, the Việt Minh immediately launched the insurrection that they had already prepared for a long time. &#x27;People&#x27;s Revolutionary Committees&#x27; across the countryside took over administrative positions, often acting on their own initiative, and in the cities, the Japanese stood by as the Vietnamese took control. On the morning of 19 August, the Việt Minh took control of Hanoi, seizing northern Vietnam in the next few days.

On 25 and 30 August 1945, Emperor Bảo Đại abdicated twice and turned over the imperial seal to the Việt Minh government, leading to the fall of the Nguyễn dynasty and Empire of Vietnam. He was then offered a position as supreme advisor. On 2 September, Hồ Chí Minh declared independence for the newly established Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headquartered in Hanoi. The same day, Japan signed the Instrument of Surrender to officially surrender to the Allies.

However, while the people celebrated their victory in the north, the Việt Minh faced various problems in the south, which was politically more diverse than the north. The Việt Minh had been unable to establish the same degree of control in the south as in the north. There were serious divisions in the independence movement in the south, where the Việt Minh, Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo, other nationalist groups and the Trotskyists competed for control.

On August 24 the Việt Minh declared a provisional administration, a Southern Administrative Committee, in Saigon. When, for the declared purpose of disarming the Japanese, the Việt Minh accommodated the landing and strategic positioning of British and British-Indian troops, the rival political groups turned out in force. On September 7 and 8, 1945, in the delta city of Cần Thơ the Committee had to rely on what had been the Japanese-auxiliary, &quot;Jeunesse d&#x27;Avant-Garde/Thanh Nien Tienphong&quot; [Vanguard Youth]. They fired upon crowds demanding arms against a French colonial restoration. 

In the north, Lê Trọng Nghĩa, who later became the head of the Intelligence Department for both the Communist Party and the military, said of events in Hanoi: &#x27;The government did not hand over power or collapse, the Việt Minh made the decision to destroy what was there, the entire administration. We were bold. Approaching the Japanese, harnessing the energy around the popularity of the Democratic Party of Vietnam to influence the outcome of the people&#x27;s uprising, and using our covert operatives within the puppet apparatus to collapse things within&#x27;.

=== Preparation and supply ===

In Hanoi on 15–20 April 1945 the Tonkin Revolutionary Military Conference of the Việt Minh issued a resolution that was reprinted on pages 1–4 on 25 August 1970 in the &quot;Nhân Dân&quot; journal. It called for a general uprising, resistance and guerilla warfare against the Japanese by establishing 7 war zones across Vietnam named after past heroes of Vietnam, calling for propaganda to explain to the people that their only way forward was violent resistance against the Japanese and exposing the Vietnamese puppet government that served them. The conference also called for training propagandists and having women spread military propaganda and target Japanese soldiers with Chinese language leaflets and Japanese language propaganda. The Việt Minh&#x27;s Vietnamese Liberation Army published the &quot;Resistance against Japan&quot; (&quot;Kháng Nhật&quot;) newspaper. They also called for the creation of a group called &quot;Chinese and Vietnamese Allied against Japan&quot; by sending leaflets to recruit overseas Chinese in Vietnam to their cause. The resolution called on forcing the French in Vietnam to recognise Vietnamese independence and for Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s France (Allied French) to recognise their independence and cooperate with them against Japan. 

Archimedes Patti stated that when he arrived in Kunming in March 1945, the French colonials were either unwilling or unable to assist him in establishing an American intelligence network in Indochina and so he turned to &quot;the only source [available],&quot; the Việt Minh. Patti was introduced to Ho Chi Minh by Colonel Austin Glass, the OSS expert in Indochina. Patti met Ho Chi Minh on the French Indochinese-Chinese border in late April 1945. Patti agreed to provide intelligence to the allies if he could have &quot;a line of communication with the allies.&quot;

On 16 July 1945, the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Special Operations &quot;Deer Team&quot; and 3 French special operatives arrived by parachute at the Việt Minh headquarters at Kim Lung. The remaining six members of the OSS &quot;Deer Team&quot; would arrive by parachute on 29 July. When the &quot;Deer Team&quot; arrived they were greeted by Võ Nguyên Giáp who apologised for their leader&#x27;s absence as Ho Chi Minh was weak and dying suffering from &quot;malaria, dengue fever, dysentery, or a combination of all three.&quot;, as OSS medic Paul Hoagland was a trained nurse he supplied Ho Chi Minh with the right medicine to let him recover from his illness. Though there is controversy if the Americans saved Ho Chi Minh from &quot;an early grave&quot; or if he would have recovered without their help.

In the first six days of August 1945 the OSS &quot;Deer Team&quot; build a training camp for the Việt Minh, this training camp consisted of 3 barracks with one being for the Việt Minh recruits, another one being for the OSS members, and another serving as a warehouse, infirmary, and radio centre. Chairman Ho referred to these barracks as the &quot;Bo Doi Viet-My&quot;, the Vietnamese-American Force. The Việt Minh supplied the OSS with 110 recruits of which the &quot;Deer Team&quot; would choose the 40 most promising to give special training instructing them how to use American weapons and drilling them like American soldiers from 9 to 15 August. More weapons and ammunition were dropped near them during the third OSS aid drop on 10 August. Võ Nguyên Giáp wanted to make sure that his newly equipped forces would be witnessed by as many people as possible showcasing them to people who would cheer them on and welcome them as liberators. By the time of the Japanese surrender OSS Major Alison Kent Thomas had already given most of his weapons to the Việt Minh&#x27;s Vietnamese-American Force, which became an issue when he received a message from Kunming, China that he was to return all OSS equipment to an American base stationed in China. However, by the time Thomas received this message both the Việt Minh&#x27;s Vietnamese-American Force and the OSS &quot;Deer Team&quot; were on the road to Hanoi to proclaim a revolution. 

While in early August 1945 the end of the war still seemed far away, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki it would become clear that the Japanese were on the losing side and as American troops moved closer to the Japanese Mainland, Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s sense of urgency would grow causing him to ramp up preparations in order to proclaim a swift and decisive revolution following the official surrender of Japan in order to take the country before the French could return. In order to retain his leadership he knew that he had to demonstrate both legitimacy and strength and quickly called for a meeting between the Việt Minh and other Vietnamese nationalist political figures, on 13 August many delegates met at Tan Trao where they established the &quot;National Insurrection Committee&quot;, its first order was to commence a general military insurrection on 14 August.

On 8 August 1945, Hanoi&#x27;s political situation became more and more heated due to the upheavals of the Second World War. The Japanese army suffered one defeat after another on allied fronts. During that time, the Việt Minh leadership instructed to conduct secret contacts with Khâm sai Phan Kế Toại, who represented the Court of the Nguyễn dynasty in the North, asking him to side with the Việt Minh. Toại was puzzled by the Việt Minh&#x27;s invitation to join their government.

According to later accounts the American government claimed that it only gave &quot;a few revolvers&quot; to the Việt Minh but according to author David Halberstam this is contradicted by &quot;a considerable of evidence&quot; suggesting that the Allied forces supplied the Việt Minh with 5,000 weapons during the summer of 1945. According to both Communist and French accounts the Việt Minh&#x27;s military numbered only around 5,000 at the time of the fall of Japan. As 5,000 weapons would have been a highly significant amount American intelligence scholar Bob Bergin questioned Halberstam&#x27;s claims as he provided no evidence, meanwhile Bergin estimated that perhaps only around 200 or so weapons had been given to the Việt Minh by the Americans during this period. Bergin noted that Ho Chi Minh learned from his own experiences that the Americans wouldn&#x27;t supply him with a sufficient amount of weapons if he asked for them and that an insufficient supply of weapons had always plagued the Việt Minh. The weapons supplied to them were supposed to have been used by the Vietnamese-American Force if the war would have continued. 

During an event known as &quot;Gold Week&quot;, Ho Chi Minh asked the Vietnamese people to contribute their gold to the Việt Minh to be able to purchase more armaments from both the Imperial Japanese forces and Chiang&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army, within only a short amount of time people &quot;from all walks of life&quot; had contributed 370 kilograms of gold and 20,000,000 piastres for the purchasing of weaponry. Historian Bernard B. Fall later commented on the success of &quot;Gold Week&quot; saying that the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army was able to purchase 3,000 rifles, 50 automatic rifles, 600 submachine guns, and 100 mortars of American manufacture. According to Fall the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army also secured substantial French and Japanese stocks of firearms and other military equipment (31,000 rifles, 700 automatic weapons, 36 artillery pieces, and 18 tanks) which were supposed to have been secured by the Chinese after the surrender of Japan, but were unable to.

=== Initial stages of the revolution ===
On 16 August the first National People&#x27;s Congress was formed and it consisted of delegates from all the different political parties that formed the Việt Minh, the first National People&#x27;s Congress included various mass organisations and representatives of different ethnic groups and religious groups. During the meeting the attendees were greeted by disciplined soldiers well-armed in uniform and at building photographs of Claire Lee Chennault were prominently displayed next to portraits of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin and the Chinese Communist Mao Zedong indicating that the Việt Minh enjoyed &quot;secret&quot; support from the Allies. During the meeting Ho Chi Minh emphasised that for the revolution to be successful they would rapidly need to take power in order to be able to provide strong opposition when the Allied forces will occupy French Indochina. 3 days later the Việt Minh would successfully take Hanoi and most of northern Vietnam.

When OSS Indochina operations chief Archimedes Patti arrived in Hanoi on 21 August with an OSS team, and accompanied by a five-man French military team to handle prisoner-of-war (POW) matters, he was shocked to see the situation in Hanoi. Patti soon found himself having to calm down the French and was worried that the demonstrations in Hanoi could soon turn into bloody situations. Patti radioed the American military base in Kunming telling them to persuade the OSS &quot;Deer Team&quot; and the 3 OSS Special Operations teams in northern Tonkin to return to Kunming as soon as possible and that no further help should be given to the Việt Minh. Archimedes Patti hoped to quickly distance the Americans from both the French and the Việt Minh to avoid getting involved in the internal struggles going on Vietnam. However, this was already too late as the &quot;Deer Team&quot; at this point was already fighting alongside the Việt Minh against the Japanese. 

From 20 to 25 August the Việt Minh engaged in the Battle of Thái Nguyên against the Japanese. Earlier on 16 August 1945 the OSS &quot;Deer Team&quot; had joined the Việt Minh despite Major Thomas having received clear orders to &quot;sit tight until further orders&quot; from the OSS. While the reasons for the battle of Thái Nguyên remain unclear, Bob Bergin speculates that the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) leaders wanted to test the combat capabilities of the Vietnamese-American Joint Force and that they had hoped for an easy victory that would both psychologically and politically reenforce the legitimacy and strength of the Việt Minh. According to American historian Douglas Pike, the battle of Thái Nguyên was the event that officially &quot;marked the liberation of Vietnam&quot;. During the battle itself only sporadic fighting broke out, as the Japanese were situated in an old French fort and the Americans were all, except for Major Thomas, away from the battle in an outside safehouse. On 25 August the final battle at Thái Nguyên ended with the Japanese &quot;surrendering&quot; agreeing to stay confined to their post. This marked the liberation of the city of Thái Nguyên from Japanese rule, after the battle ended Thái Nguyên erupted in celebrations and held an independence parade. From this point onwards the Americans completely disassociated themselves from engaging in the August Revolution.

In a telegram sent to Tokyo, the Japanese ambassador to Indochina in Hanoi confirmed: &quot;On the afternoon of the 19th, the Ambassador was &#x27;invited&#x27; to attend a meeting with the leaders of Etsumei (Việt Minh) and participated in discussions with them, considered as official authorities.&quot;

=== Events in Huế ===

According to Nguyễn Kỳ Nam on 12 August 1945 a Japanese general entered the city of Huế and asked to meet with the Minister of Justice Trịnh Đình Thảo saying that there were urgent and confidential matters. At that time, the journalist Nguyễn Kỳ Nam was present because he was General Manager of the Ministry of Justice office in Huế of the Trần Trọng Kim cabinet. He informed the minister that he had come from Saigon, Cochinchina to ask for an audience with the Emperor to ask for permission to deal with the Việt Minh&#x27;s uprising. 

On 17 August 1945, the government of Trần Trọng Kim held a national rally, but because of the support of the people, the rally turned into a march in support of the Việt Minh forces. As the imperial government of Vietnam saw the success of the August Revolution minister Trần Đình Nam suggested to Trần Trọng Kim to dissolve the government in favour of the Việt Minh in solidarity around the strongest and most enthusiastic organisation noting that this would disallow foreigners to play &quot;divide and conquer&quot; in Vietnam. Among his suggestions was not just to dissolve the cabinet but to abolish the Nguyễn dynasty altogether and ask for the Emperor to abdicate, in response Trần Trọng Kim got furious at Trần Đình Nam for daring to suggest that the Emperor should relinquish his position causing a heated debate between the two men.

On 23 August, the Việt Minh-led uprising in Huế won. The people directing the uprising were Nguyễn Chí Thanh and Tố Hữu. The uprising was contributed by the Frontline Youth (&quot;Thanh niên tiền tuyến&quot;, also known as the &quot;Thanh niên Phan Anh&quot;), which was originally the policing department of Trần Trọng Kim&#x27;s government but when the revolution broke out, it turned to support the Việt Minh.

=== Events in Cochinchina ===

In Saigon-Cholon, the important symbolic act of the transfer of power was Field Marshal Count Hisaichi Terauchi&#x27;s pledge on 22 August to Trần Văn Giàu and Phạm Ngọc Thạch – two senior representatives of the Việt Minh – that the Japanese would not intervene if the Việt Minh seized power. Terauchi also handed over his personal sword (&quot;Wakizashi&quot;) and personal gun to Việt Minh representatives as a symbolic act. 

When the British entered southern French Indochina after the surrender of Japan they became politically involved and imposed martial law in order to keep anti-colonial forces under control.

=== Abdication of Emperor Bảo Đại ===

The telegram sent by &quot;Un comité de patriotes représentant tous les partis et toutes les couches de la population&quot; set an ultimatum of 12 hours for Bảo Đại to abdicate, otherwise they couldn&#x27;t guarantee that he or his family would survive the August Revolution. Bảo Đại claimed that he had attempted to contact the American President Harry S. Truman, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek, King George VI, and General Charles de Gaulle for help but that none of them answered. A young tutor of Crown Prince Nguyễn Phúc Bảo Long begged for Bảo Đại to take shelter in the Imperial Tomb but he refused. Bảo Đại later received a second telegram from Hanoi asking for his abdication. 

It is not known who convinced Emperor Bảo Đại to abdicate, as it might have been Huỳnh Thúc Kháng or Phạm Khắc Hòe. The latter drew a comparison with this situation and the fate of King Louis XVI of France.
A French military force entitled &quot;Lambda&quot; consisting of 6 men led by the French captain Castelnat parachuted 28 kilometers from Huế in order to try to prevent Emperor Bảo Đại from abdicating. However, they were captured by the Việt Minh as soon as their parachutes hit the ground. 

The abdication of Emperor Bảo Đại was officially announced on 25 August 1945. The imperial edict ending the Nguyễn dynasty was composed by Emperor Bảo Đại with the help of Prince Nguyễn Phúc Vĩnh Cẩn on the night of 22 August 1945 at the Kien Trung palace within the Citadel of Huế. The next morning, when the representatives of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Trần Huy Liệu and Cù Huy Cận came to the palace to receive the documents of resignation, Emperor Bảo Đại at first gave the declaration to Trần Huy Liệu, but Liệu then convinced the Emperor to hold a formal ceremony announcing his abdication. 

Together with his edict declaring his abdication, Emperor Bảo Đại also promulgated an edict which was directed at the imperial family of the Nguyễn dynasty, reminding them of his attachment to the &quot;dân vi qúi&quot; philosophy and of his vow that he would rather be only a citizen of an independent country than the puppet ruler of an enslaved country. He called on the members of the imperial family to support the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and that they should also work to preserve Vietnam&#x27;s independence. Both of these edicts made it clear that Emperor Bảo Đại&#x27;s will to step aside on behalf of the new government in Hanoi. The edicts also contained the notion that he was unambiguously transmitting his mandate voluntarily rather than under any form of coercion. 

As a part of his official abdication, Emperor Bảo Đại personally gave his regalia to representatives of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in ceremony. In this ceremony he handed over the &quot;Hoàng Đế chi bảo&quot; (皇帝之寶) seal weighing around 10 kilograms and the jade-encrusted silver sword (&quot;An dân bảo kiếm&quot;, known as the &quot;Sword of the State&quot;) to the Communist government. The passing of the ceremonial seal and sword had been seen as symbolically &quot;passing the Mandate of Heaven over to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam&quot;.

The August Revolution was proclaimed to be successful, on 25 August 1945, President Hồ Chí Minh together with the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Trung ương Đảng) and the National Committee for the Liberation of the People (Ủy ban Dân tộc giải phóng) returned to Hanoi. The abdication of Emperor Bảo Đại further symbolised the end of the military government and the beginning of a civilian government for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. 

It is said that during the ceremony the Bảo Đại Emperor said that he would rather &quot;be a citizen of a free country than the Emperor of an enslaved country&quot;. At the end of the abdication ceremony it is reported that the crowd loudly exclaimed &quot;&quot;Việt Nam độc lập muôn năm!&quot;, &quot;Việt Nam Dân chủ Cộng hòa muôn năm!&quot;&quot; (Ten thousand years to an independent Vietnam! Ten-thousand years to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!).
On the afternoon of 27 August and the morning of 28 August 1945, Phạm Khắc Hòe had an inventory of assets in the imperial Citadel to hand over to the Revolutionary Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The most valuable items were the historical pearl and ivory objects of the Nguyễn Emperors. These were stored in a large tunnel behind the Palace of Heavenly Purity. Phạm Khắc Hòe would organise the handover ceremony that was to be held on 30 August 1945.

Following his abdication former Emperor Bảo Đại accepted President Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s offer to become an advisor to the new Vietnamese government in Hanoi. Hồ Chí Minh gave him the title of &quot;Conseiller suprême du gouvernement&quot; (Supreme-councilor of the government), but Bảo Đại understood that this position was one that could have easily resulted in his death if he ever stepped out of line. President Hồ Chí Minh hoped that he could make Bảo Đại into the &quot;Souphanouvong of Vietnam&quot; but failed.

=== Declaration of independence ===
=== Events in Saigon following the declaration of independence ===

On 2 September 1945, thousands of people from many provinces and in Saigon flocked to Norodom square (near the Notre Dame Cathedral) waiting to hear President Ho Chi Minh read Declaration of Independence in Hanoi. But due to the bad weather and the level of technology at that time, Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s proclamations to the nation did not reach the people attending the rally. Trần Văn Giàu, Chairman of the Administrative Committee of Nam Bộ, stepped on the stage to call on the people to unite around Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s government, raise vigilance against the colonisers in case they return to invade Vietnam again. The rally soon turned into an anti-French protest, in response the French started shooting at the protestors killing 47 and injuring more.

In Saigon, the brutal reassertion of French authority under the protection of British, British-Indian and British-commandeered Japanese, forces triggered a general uprising on 23 September. But the various militias were not only hit hard by the newly disembarked French forces, as they fell back into the countryside they were also assailed by the Việt Minh, who hunted down and executed their leaders (among their victims, the Trotskyists Tạ Thu Thâu and Phan Văn Hùm).

== Aftermath ==


=== Allied occupation and Việt Minh consolidation ===

Just as Hồ Chí Minh and the Việt Minh had begun to extend DRV control to all of Vietnam, the attention of his new government was shifting from internal matters to the arrival of Allied troops. At the Potsdam conference in July 1945, the Allies divided Indochina into two zones at the 16th parallel, attaching the southern zone to the Southeast Asia command and leaving the northern part to Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Republic of China to accept the surrender of the Japanese.

The occupation period proved to be a great challenge for Ho Chi Minh and the ICP. When British forces from the Southeast Asia Command arrived in Saigon on 13 September, they brought along a detachment of French troops. The acquiescence of British occupation forces in the south allowed the French to move rapidly to reassert control over the south of the country, where its economic interests were strongest, DRV authority was weakest and colonial forces were the most deeply entrenched.

However, in the north, the occupation period became the critical opportunity for the Việt Minh to consolidate and triumph over domestic rivals. On 20 August, Chiang Kai-shek gave orders for the Chinese First Front Army, under the command of General Lu Han of Yunnan, to cross into Vietnam to accept the surrender of the Japanese 38th Army. The Chinese, unlike the British in the south, refused to prepare the way for an immediate French return; to maintain order in Hanoi and keep the city functioning, they allowed the Vietnamese Provisional Government to remain in control. With that breathing space, Hồ Chí Minh was able to maneuver against and then to eliminate his domestic rivals, thus strengthening Việt Minh control over northern Vietnamese politics.

=== Entry of Chinese troops into northern Vietnam ===
General Lu Han&#x27;s 200,000 Chinese soldiers occupied north Vietnam starting August 1945. 90,000 arrived by October, the 62nd army came on 26 September to Nam Dinh and Haiphong. Lang Son and Cao Bang were occupied by the Guangxi 62nd army corps and the red river region and Lai Cai were occupied by a column from Yunnan. Vietnamese VNQDD fighters accompanied the Chinese soldiers. Ho Chi Minh ordered his DRV administration to set quotas for rice to give to the Chinese soldiers and rice was sold in Chinese currency in the red River delta. Lu Han occupied the French governor general&#x27;s palace after ejecting the French staff under Sainteny. Chinese soldiers occupied northern Indochina north of the 16th parallel while the British under the South-East Asia Command of Lord Mountbatten occupied the south. Chiang Kai-shek deliberately withheld his crack and well trained soldiers from occupying Vietnam since he was going to use them to fight the Communists inside China and instead sent undisciplined warlord troops from Yunnan under Lu Han to occupy north Vietnam and Hanoi north of the 16th parallel to disarm and get Japanese troops to surrender.

Ho Chi Minh confiscated gold taels, jewellery and coins in September 1945 during &quot;Gold Week&quot; to give to Chinese forces occupying northern Vietnam. Rice to Cochinchina by the French in October 1945 were divided by Ho Chi Minh, and the northern Vietnamese only received one third while the Chinese soldiers were given two thirds by Ho Chi Minh. For 15 days elections were postponed by Ho Chi Minh in response to a demand by Chinese general Chen Xiuhe on 18 December 1945 so that the Chinese could get the Dong Minh Hoi and VNQDD to prepare. The Chinese left only in April–June 1946. Ho Chi Minh gave golden smoking paraphernalia and a golden opium pipe to the Chinese general Lu Han after gold week and purchased weapons with what was left of the proceeds.

Starving Vietnamese were dying throughout northern Vietnam in 1945 due to the Japanese seizure of their crops by the time the Chinese came to disarm the Japanese and Vietnamese corpses were all throughout the streets of Hanoi and had to be cleaned up by students. While Chiang Kai-shek, Xiao Wen (Hsiao Wen) and the Kuomintang central government of China was disinterested in occupying Vietnam beyond the allotted time period and involving itself in the war between the Viet Minh and the French, the Yunnan warlord Lu Han held the opposite view and wanted to occupy Vietnam to prevent the French returning and establish a Chinese trusteeship of Vietnam under the principles of the Atlantic Charter with the aim of eventually preparing Vietnam for independence and blocking the French from returning.

Ho Chi Minh sent a cable on 17 October 1945 to American President Harry S. Truman calling on him, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Premier Stalin and Premier Attlee to go to the United Nations against France and demand France not be allowed to return to occupy Vietnam, accusing France of having sold out and cheated the Allies by surrendering Indochina to Japan and that France had no right to return. Ho Chi Minh dumped the blame on Dong Minh Hoi and VNQDD for signing the agreement with France for returning its soldiers to Vietnam after he had to do it himself. Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Viet Minh tried to organize welcome parades for Chinese soldiers in northern Vietnam and covered for instances of bad behavior by warlord soldiers, trying to reassure Vietnamese that the warlord troops of Lu Han were only there temporarily and that China supported Vietnam&#x27;s independence. Viet Minh newspapers said that the same ancestors (huyết thống) and culture were shared by Vietnamese and Chinese and that the Chinese heroically fought Japan and changed in the 1911 revolution and was attacked by western imperialists so it was &quot;not the same as feudal China&quot;. Ho Chi Minh forbade his soldiers like Trần Huy Liệu in Phú Thọ from attacking Chinese soldiers and Ho Chi Minh even surrendered Vietnamese who attacked Chinese soldiers to be executed as punishment in the Ro-Nha incident in Kiến An district on 6 March 1946 after Hồ Đức Thành and Đào Văn Biểu, special commissioners sent from Hanoi by Ho&#x27;s DRV examined the case. Ho Chi Minh appeased and granted numerous concessions to the Chinese soldiers to avoid the possibility of them clashing with the Viet Minh, with him ordering Vietnamese not to carry out anything against Chinese soldiers and pledging his life on his promise, hoping the Chinese would disarm the Japanese soldiers and finish their mission as fast as possible.

Chinese communist guerilla leader Chu Chia-pi came into northern Vietnam multiple times in 1945 and 1948 and helped the Viet Minh fight against the French from Yunnan. Other Chinese Communists, including general Chen Geng, also did the same.

=== French war crimes after the revolution ===
Vietnamese civilians were robbed, raped and killed by French soldiers in Saigon when they came back in August 1945. Vietnamese women were also raped in north Vietnam by the French like in Bảo Hà, Bảo Yên District, Lào Cai province and Phu Lu, which caused 400 Vietnamese who were trained by the French to defect on 20 June 1948. Buddhist statues were looted and Vietnamese were robbed, raped and tortured by the French after the French crushed the Viet Minh in northern Vietnam in 1947–1948 forcing the Viet Minh to flee into Yunnan, China for sanctuary and aid from the Chinese Communists. A French reporter was told &quot;We know what war always is, We understand your soldiers taking our animals, our jewellery, our Buddhas; it is normal. We are resigned to their raping our wives and our daughters; war has always been like that. But we object to being treated in the same way, not only our sons, but ourselves, old men and dignitaries that we are.&quot; by Vietnamese village notables. Vietnamese rape victims became &quot;half insane&quot;.

=== 6 March Franco-Vietnamese Accord ===

As southern Vietnam&#x27;s disunited resistance forces struggled to push back French advances, Hồ Chí Minh and the DRV started to negotiate with France in the hope of preserving national independence and to avoid war. In March 1946, the two sides reached an accord.

Instead of obtaining French recognition of Vietnamese &quot;independence,&quot; Hồ Chí Minh agreed to his government being weakly identified as a &quot;free state&quot; within the Indochinese Federation under the French Union. For their part, the French agreed to two provisions that they had no intention of honouring. French troops north of the 16th parallel were limited to 15,000 men for a period of five years, and a referendum was to be held on the issue of unifying the Vietnamese regions. The agreement entangled the French and Vietnamese in joint military operations and fruitless negotiations for several months.

However, the status of southern Vietnam was the sticking point. The March accord, which called for a referendum to determine whether the south would rejoin the rest of the country or remain a separate French territory, left the fate of former Cochin China in flux.

=== First Indochina War ===

The preliminary accord was but the first step toward an intended overall and lasting agreement. Southern Vietnam&#x27;s future political status had to be negotiated. From June to September 1946, Hồ Chí Minh met with French representatives in Vietnam and France to discuss that and other issues. Unfortunately, almost immediately after the signing of the 6 March accord, relations began to deteriorate. Negotiations at Dalat and then at Fontainebleau broke down over the issue of the fate of southern Vietnam. As talks failed to bring results, both sides began to prepare for a military solution. Provocations by both French and DRV troops led to the outbreak of full-scale guerrilla war on 19 December 1946. Nearly one year after the August Revolution, the DRV and France were fighting the First Indochina War.

<doc id="612507" wikidata="Q7978983" url="?curid=612507" title="Webster v. Reproductive Health Services">
<text>Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989), was a United States Supreme Court decision on upholding a Missouri law that imposed restrictions on the use of state funds, facilities, and employees in performing, assisting with, or counseling an abortion. The Supreme Court in &quot;Webster&quot; allowed for states to legislate in an aspect that had previously been thought to be forbidden under &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973).

==Background==
The state of Missouri passed a law that in its preamble stated that &quot;the life of each human being begins at conception&quot;, and &quot;unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being.&quot;

The statute
# required that all Missouri state laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with rights equal to those enjoyed by other persons, subject to limits imposed by the federal constitution, and federal court rulings;
# prohibited government-employed doctors from aborting a fetus they believed to be viable;
# prohibited the use of state employees or facilities to perform or assist abortions, except where the mother&#x27;s life was in danger; and
# prohibited the use of public funds, employees, or facilities to &quot;encourage or counsel&quot; a woman to have an abortion, except where her life was in danger.

The United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri struck down the above provisions, and prohibited their enforcement. This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which ruled that these provisions violated &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and later Supreme Court decisions. William L. Webster, then Missouri Attorney General, appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. It was argued before the Court on April 26, 1989.

==Opinion of the Court==

The Court overturned the decision of the lower courts, stating that:
# The Court did not need to consider the constitutionality of the law&#x27;s preamble, as it is not used to justify any abortion regulation otherwise invalid under &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.
# The prohibitions on the use of public employees, facilities, and funds did not violate any of the Court&#x27;s abortion decisions, as no affirmative right to the use of state aid for nontherapeutic abortions existed. The state could allocate resources in favor of childbirth over abortion if it so chose.
# Provisions requiring testing for viability after 20 weeks of pregnancy were constitutional, but those limiting abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy were unconstitutional.

Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion of the Court for all but Parts II-D and III; however, only Justices White and Kennedy joined that opinion in its entirety. In discussing the fetal viability section, the plurality asserted that the right to abortion was a &quot;liberty interest protected by the Due Process clause&quot; subject to restriction by any laws which would permissibly further a rational state interest such as protecting potential life. The plurality said that this would require the court to &quot;modify and narrow &quot;Roe&quot; and succeeding cases.&quot;

Part II-A was about statutory construction. The Missouri Act&#x27;s preamble included a legislative finding, &quot;inter alia&quot;, that &quot;[the] life of each human being begins at conception&quot; and unborn children have &quot;protectable interests in life&quot;. The Court of Appeals applied &quot;Akron&quot;&#x27;s dictum that &quot;a state may not adopt one theory of life when life begins to justify its regulation of abortions&quot; to invalidate the preamble. Chief Justice Rehnquist&#x27;s opinion declined to decide the constitutionality of the preamble, quoting from &quot;Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory&quot;: 

Lacking any authoritative construction of the statute by the state courts, without which no constitutional question arises, and lacking the authority to give such a controlling construction ourselves, and with a record which presents no concrete set of facts to which the statute is to be applied, the case is plainly not one to be disposed of by the declaratory judgment procedure.

Justices O&#x27;Connor and Scalia joined Rehnquist&#x27;s opinion except for the section on viability testing. Each wrote a separate concurring opinion. Justice O&#x27;Connor said the preamble did not prohibit abortions and agreed with the Chief Justice that fears the preamble could bar access to post-fertilization contraceptives and IVF fertility treatment were &quot;too hypothetical&quot; to support declaratory judgment or injunctive remedies. 

O&#x27;Connor said that narrowing &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in the context of the &quot;Webster&quot; litigation, where upholding Missouri&#x27;s law could arguably be squared with &quot;Roe&quot;, would violate an important principle of judicial restraint. She then explained that she voted to uphold Missouri&#x27;s law because she did not feel that it would place an undue burden on the right to abortion.

Justice Scalia, who was angered by the refusal of the plurality, as well as Justice O&#x27;Connor, to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, wrote a sharp opinion concurring in the judgment. In his concurrence he argued that the Court ought to have overturned &quot;Roe&quot;, rather than attempting to uphold both &quot;Roe&quot; and the laws at issue, and he attacked Justice O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s justification for declining to overturn &quot;Roe&quot;. He also agreed with Blackmun&#x27;s assertion that the approach of the plurality would make &quot;Roe&quot; a dead letter.

===Dissent===
Justice Blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, which focused on the plurality&#x27;s desired narrowing of &quot;Roe&quot; as described in the section on the viability testing requirement. He wrote that the plurality&#x27;s approach would allow a state to put virtually any restriction on abortion so long as it was rationally related to promoting potential life, and that this in effect would overturn &quot;Roe&quot;. Noting that the plurality and Scalia together were only a single vote away from effectively overruling &quot;Roe&quot;, he wrote &quot;I fear for the future&quot; and &quot;a chill wind blows.&quot;

Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissent, where he concurred with the plurality in allowing the state to prohibit public funds from being allocated for abortion counselling, but argued the court otherwise should have upheld the lower courts in striking down the remaining restrictions.

<text>A register is the range within pitch space of some music or often musical speech. It may describe a given pitch or pitch class (or set of them), a human voice or musical instrument (or group of them), or both, as in a melody or part. It is also often related to timbre and musical form. In musical compositions, it may be fixed or &quot;frozen&quot;.

==Relation to other musical elements or parameters==
Register is often understood in relation to other elements of music, sometimes called parameters.

===Relation to pitch===
A &quot;higher&quot; register may be said to indicate a &quot;higher&quot; pitch. For example, violins may be said to be in a &quot;higher&quot; register than cellos. This is often denoted concisely using subscripted numerals in scientific pitch notation.

===Relation to timbre===
The register in which an instrument plays, or in which a part is written, affects the quality of sound, or its timbre.

===Relation to form===
Register is also used structurally in musical form, with the climax of a piece usually being in the highest register of that piece.

====Fixed or &quot;frozen&quot; register====
Some modernist and especially twelve-tone or serial pieces have fixed register (sometimes called frozen register), allowing a pitch class to be expressed through only one pitch. This technique is often associated with or attributed to Anton Webern, and it later appears in the music of Arthur Berger, Pierre Boulez, Elliott Carter, and Karlheinz Stockhausen.

==Practical contexts==
===Human voice===
A &quot;register&quot; of the human voice, such as whistle register, is a series of tones of like quality originating through operation of the larynx. The constituent tones result from similar patterns of vibration in the vocal folds, which can generate several different such patterns, each resulting in characteristic sounds within a particular range of pitches. The term has wide application and can refer to any of several aspects of the human voice, including the following:

* A particular segment of the vocal range;
* A resonance area such as chest voice or head voice;
* A phonatory process;
* A certain vocal timbre; or
* A region of the voice set off by vocal breaks.

Speech pathologists and many vocal pedagogues recognize four vocal registers: the vocal fry, modal, falsetto, and whistle. To delineate these registers, pathologists specify vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, sequential pitches, and type of sound.

===Wind instruments===
In the context of wind instruments, the word register usually distinguishes pitch ranges produced using different normal modes of the air column, with higher registers produced by overblowing. The timbres of different woodwind instrument registers tend to be markedly different.

====Flute====
The Western concert flute plays approximately three and a half octaves and generally has three complete registers and one partial register. The musical note C4 (corresponding to middle C on the piano) would be in that instrument&#x27;s first register, whereas the second register — where overblowing is needed — begins at E5.

====Clarinet====
On the clarinet, the notes from (written) G4 or A4 to B4 sometimes are regarded as a separate &quot;throat register&quot;, even though both they and the notes from F4 down are produced using the instrument&#x27;s lowest normal mode. The timbre of the throat notes differs, and the throat register&#x27;s fingerings also are distinctive, using special keys and not the standard tone holes used for other notes.

<text>In cryptography, MISTY1 (or MISTY-1) is a block cipher designed in 1995 by Mitsuru Matsui and others for Mitsubishi Electric.

MISTY1 is one of the selected algorithms in the European NESSIE project, and has been among the cryptographic techniques recommended for Japanese government use by CRYPTREC in 2003; however, it was dropped to &quot;candidate&quot; by CRYPTREC revision in 2013. However, it was successfully broken in 2015 by Yosuke Todo using integral cryptanalysis; this attack was improved in the same year by Achiya Bar-On.

&quot;MISTY&quot; can stand for &quot;Mitsubishi Improved Security Technology&quot;; it is also the initials of the researchers involved in its development: Matsui Mitsuru, Ichikawa Tetsuya, Sorimachi Toru, Tokita Toshio, and Yamagishi Atsuhiro.

MISTY1 is covered by patents, although the algorithm is freely available for academic (non-profit) use in RFC 2994, and there&#x27;s a GPLed implementation by Hironobu Suzuki (used by, e.g. Scramdisk).

==Security==
MISTY1 is a Feistel network with a variable number of rounds (any multiple of 4), though 8 are recommended. The cipher operates on 64-bit blocks and has a key size of 128 bits. MISTY1 has an innovative recursive structure; the round function itself uses a 3-round Feistel network. MISTY1 claims to be provably secure against linear and differential cryptanalysis.

==KASUMI==
KASUMI is a successor of the MISTY1 cipher which was supposed to be stronger than MISTY1 and has been adopted as the standard encryption algorithm for European mobile phones. In 2005, KASUMI was broken, and in 2010 a new paper was published (explained below) detailing a practical attack on the cipher; see the article for more details.

In the paper &quot;Block Ciphers and Stream Ciphers&quot; by Alex Biryukov, it is noted that KASUMI, also termed A5/3, is a strengthened version of block cipher MISTY1 running in a Counter mode.

However, in 2010 Dunkelman, Keller, and Shamir showed that KASUMI is not as strong as MISTY1; the KASUMI attack will not work against MISTY1.

<text>Lunar Prospector was a spacecraft that orbited the Moon for 19 months in 1998-99. From a low polar orbit, it mapped surface composition including lunar hydrogen deposits, measured magnetic and gravity fields, and studied lunar outgassing events. The mission ended July 31, 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole.

Data from the mission provided detailed mapping of the surface composition of the Moon, and helped to improve understanding of the origin, evolution, current state, and resources of the Moon. The mission identified the presence of hydrogen, implying deposits of ice on the Moon. Several articles on the scientific results were published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;.

&quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; was the third mission selected by NASA for full development and construction as part of the Discovery Program. It was managed by NASA Ames Research Center with the prime contractor being Lockheed Martin; it cost $62.8 million. The Principal Investigator for the mission was Alan Binder. His personal account of the mission, &quot;Lunar Prospector: Against all Odds&quot;, is highly critical of the bureaucracy of NASA overall, and of its contractors.

== Spacecraft and subsystems ==
The spacecraft was a graphite-epoxy drum, in diameter and high with three radial instrument booms. A extension boom at the end of one of the 2.5 m booms held the magnetometer. Total initial mass (fully fueled) was . It was spin-stabilized (nominal spin rate 12 rpm) with its spin axis normal to the ecliptic plane. The spacecraft was controlled by six hydrazine monopropellant 22-newton thrusters (two aft, two forward, and two tangential). Three fuel tanks mounted inside the drum held of hydrazine pressurized by helium. The power system consisted of body-mounted solar cells which produced an average of 186 W and a 4.8 A·h rechargeable NiCd battery. 

Communications were through two S band transponders, a slotted, phased-array medium-gain antenna for downlink, and an omnidirectional low-gain antenna for downlink and uplink. The on-board computer was a Harris 80C86 (based on Intel&#x27;s 8086) with 64 kilobytes of EEPROM and 64 kilobytes of static RAM. All control was from the ground, the computer echoing each command to the ground for verification there. Once the command was ground-verified, an &quot;execute&quot; command from the ground told the computer to proceed with execution of the command. The computer built telemetry data as a combination of immediate data and also read from a circular queue buffer which allowed the computer to repeat data it had read 53 minutes earlier. This simple solid-state recorder ensured that all data collected during communications blackout periods would be received, providing the blackout was not longer than 53 minutes.

The probe also carried a small amount of the remains of Eugene Shoemaker (April 28, 1928 – July 18, 1997), astrogeologist and co-discoverer of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, to the Moon for a space burial.

In 2013 an unidentified piece of space junk was discovered in an unstable orbit around the Earth, and assigned the provisional number WT1190F. After it crashed into the Indian Ocean, the object was identified as probably the translunar injector of Lunar Prospector.

== Mission profile ==

Following launch on January 7, 1998 UT (January 6 EST) aboard a four-stage Athena II rocket, &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; had a 105-hour cruise to the Moon. During the cruise, the three instrument booms were deployed. The MAG and APS collected calibration data, while the GRS, NS, and ER outgassed for one day, after which they also collected calibration data in cislunar space. The craft was inserted into an 11.6-hour period capture orbit about the Moon at the end of the cruise phase. After 24 hours &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; was inserted into a 3.5-hour period intermediate orbit, followed 24 hours later (on January 13, 1998) by transfer into a preliminary mapping orbit, and then on January 16 by insertion into the near-circular altitude nominal lunar polar mapping orbit with an inclination of 90 degrees and a period of 118 minutes. Lunar calibration data was collected during the 11.6- and 3.5-hour orbits. Lunar mapping data collection started shortly after the 118 minute orbit was achieved. The data collection was periodically interrupted during the mission as planned for orbital maintenance burns, which took place to recircularize the orbit whenever the periselene or aposelene was more than to from the 100 km nominal orbit; this occurred about once per month. On December 19, 1998, a maneuver lowered the orbit to to perform higher resolution studies. The orbit was altered again on January 28 to a orbit, ending the one year primary mission and beginning the extended mission.

The mission ended on July 31, 1999 at 9:52:02 UT (5:52:02 EDT) when &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; was steered into a deliberate collision in a permanently shadowed area of the Shoemaker crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that the impact would liberate water vapor from the suspected ice deposits in the crater and that the plume would be detectable from Earth; however, no such plume was observed.

The &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; mission was the third mission selected by NASA for full development and launch as part of NASA&#x27;s Discovery Program. Total cost for the mission was $63 million including development ($34 million), launch vehicle (~$25 million) and operations (~$4 million).

== Instruments ==
The spacecraft carried six instruments: a Gamma Ray Spectrometer, a Neutron Spectrometer, a Magnetometer, an Electron Reflectometer, an Alpha Particle Spectrometer, and a Doppler Gravity Experiment. The instruments were omnidirectional and required no sequencing. The normal observation sequence was to record and downlink data continuously.

=== Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) ===
The &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) produced the first global measurements of gamma-ray spectra from the lunar surface, from which are derived the first &quot;direct&quot; measurements of the chemical composition for the entire lunar surface. 

The GRS was a small cylinder which was mounted on the end of one of the three radial booms extending from &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot;. It consisted of a bismuth germanate crystal surrounded by a shield of borated plastic. Gamma rays striking the bismuth atoms produced a flash of light with an intensity proportional to the energy of the gamma ray which was recorded by detectors. The energy of the gamma ray is associated with the element responsible for its emission. Due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, multiple passes were required to generate statistically significant results. At nine passes per month, it was expected to take about three months to confidently estimate abundances of thorium, potassium, and uranium, and 12 months for the other elements. The precision varies according to element measured. For U, Th, and K, the precision is 7% to 15%, for Fe 45%, for Ti 20%, and for the overall distribution of KREEP 15% to 30%. The borated plastic shield was used in the detection of fast neutrons. The GRS was designed to achieve global coverage from an altitude of approximately and with a surface resolution of .

The instrument mapped the distribution of various important elements across the Moon. For example, the &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; GRS identified several regions with high iron concentrations.

The fundamental purpose of the GRS experiment was to provide global maps of elemental abundances on the lunar surface. The GRS was designed to record the spectrum of gamma rays emitted by:
# the radioactive decay of elements contained in the Moon&#x27;s crust; and
# elements in the crust bombarded by cosmic rays and solar wind particles.
The most important elements detectable by the GRS were uranium (U), thorium (Th), and potassium (K), radioactive elements which generate gamma rays spontaneously, and iron (Fe), titanium (Ti), oxygen (O), silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca), elements which emit gamma rays when hit by cosmic rays or solar wind particles. The uranium, thorium, and potassium in particular were used to map the location of KREEP (potassium, rare-earth element, and phosphorus containing material, which is thought to have developed late in the formation of the crust and upper mantle, and is therefore important to understanding lunar evolution). The GRS was also capable of detecting fast (epithermal) neutrons, which complemented the neutron spectrometer in the search for water on the Moon.

=== Neutron Spectrometer (NS) ===
Based on the &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; Neutron Spectrometer (NS) data, mission scientists have determined that there is evidence for lunar water ice in the polar craters of the Moon, an estimated 3 billion tonnes (800 billion US gallons).

The neutron spectrometer was a narrow cylinder colocated with the Alpha Particle Spectrometer at the end of one of the three radial &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; science booms. The instrument had a surface resolution of . The neutron spectrometer consisted of two canisters each containing helium-3 and an energy counter. Any thermal neutrons colliding with the helium atoms give an energy signature which can be detected and counted. One of the canisters was wrapped in cadmium, and one in tin. The cadmium screens out thermal (low energy or slow-moving) neutrons, while the tin does not. Thermal neutrons are cosmic-ray-generated neutrons which have lost much of their energy in collisions with hydrogen atoms. Differences in the counts between the two canisters indicate the number of thermal neutrons detected, which in turn indicates the amount of hydrogen in the Moon&#x27;s crust at a given location. Large quantities of hydrogen would likely be due to the presence of water.

The NS was designed to detect minute amounts of water ice which were believed to exist on the Moon. It was capable of detecting water ice at a level of less than 0.01%. For the polar ice studies, the NS was slated to examine the poles to 80 degrees latitude, with a sensitivity of at least 10 ppm by volume of hydrogen. For the implanted hydrogen studies, the NS was intended to examine the entire globe with a sensitivity of 50 ppmv. The Moon has a number of permanently shadowed craters near the poles with continuous temperatures of . These craters may act as cold-traps of water from incoming comets and meteoroids. Any water from these bodies which found its way into these craters could become permanently frozen. The NS was also used to measure the abundance of hydrogen implanted by solar wind.

=== The Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS) ===

The Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS) was a cube approximately colocated with the neutron spectrometer on the end of one of the three radial &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; science booms. It contained ten silicon detectors sandwiched between gold and aluminum disks arranged on five of six sides of the cube. Alpha particles, produced by the decay of radon and polonium, leave tracks of charge on the silicon wafers when they impact the silicon. A high voltage is applied to the silicon, and the current is amplified by being funneled along the tracks to the aluminum disk and is recorded for identification. The APS was designed to make a global examination of gas release events and polonium distribution with a surface resolution of and a precision of 10%.

The APS was designed to detect radon outgassing events on the surface of the Moon. The APS recorded alpha particle signatures of radioactive decay of radon gas and its byproduct product, polonium. These putative outgassing events, in which radon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide are vented, are hypothesized to be the source of the tenuous lunar atmosphere, and may be the result of the low-level volcanic/tectonic activity on the Moon. Information on the existence, timing, and sources of these events may help in a determination of the style and rate of lunar tectonics.

The APS was damaged during launch, ruining one of the five detecting faces. Additionally, due to sunspot activity peaking during the mission, the lunar data was obscured by solar interference. The information was eventually recovered by subtracting out the effects of the solar activity.

=== Doppler Gravity Experiment (DGE) ===

The Doppler Gravity Experiment (DGE) was the first polar, low-altitude mapping of the lunar gravity field. The &quot;Clementine&quot; mission had previously produced a relatively low-resolution map, but the &quot;Prospector&quot; DGE obtained data approximately five times as detailed: the &quot;first truly operational gravity map of the Moon&quot;. The practical benefits of this are more stable long-term orbits and better fuel efficiency. Additionally, the DGE data is hoped to help researchers learn more about lunar origins and the nature of the lunar core. The DGE identified three new near-side mass concentration regions.

The purpose of the &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; DGE was to learn about the surface and internal mass distribution of the Moon. This is accomplished by measuring the Doppler shift in the S-band tracking signal as it reaches Earth, which can be converted to spacecraft accelerations. The accelerations can be processed to provide estimates of the lunar gravity field, from which the location and size of mass anomalies affecting the spacecraft orbit can be modeled. Estimates of the surface and internal mass distribution give information on the crust, lithosphere, and internal structure of the Moon.

This experiment provided the first lunar gravity data from a low polar orbit. Because line-of-sight tracking was required for this experiment, only the near-side gravity field could be estimated using this Doppler method. The experiment was a byproduct of the spacecraft S band tracking, and so has no listed weight or power requirements. The experiment was designed to give the near-side gravity field with a surface resolution of and precision of 5 mGal (0.05 mm/s²) in the form of spherical harmonic coefficients to degree and order 60. In the extended mission, in which the spacecraft descended to an orbit with an altitude of and then to , this resolution was expected to improve by a factor of 100 or more.

The downlink telemetry signal was transmitted at 2273 MHz, over a ±1 MHz bandwidth as a right-hand circularly polarized signal at a nominal power of 5 W and peak power of 7 W. Command uplinks were sent at 2093.0542 MHz over a ±1 MHz bandwidth. The transponder was a standard Loral/Conic S-Band transponder. An omnidirectional antenna can be used for uplink and downlink, or a medium gain helix antenna can be used (downlink only). Since the spacecraft was spin-stabilized, the spin resulted in a bias in the Doppler signal due to the spacecraft antenna pattern spinning with respect to the Earth station of 0.417 Hz (27.3 mm/s) for the omnidirectional antenna, and −0.0172 Hz (−1.12 mm/s) for the medium gain antenna. LOS data was sampled at 5 seconds to account for the approximately 5 second spin rate of the spacecraft, leaving a residual of less than 0.1 mm/s.

The detailed data collected has shown that for low lunar orbit the only stable or &quot;frozen orbits&quot; are at inclinations near 27º, 50º, 76º, and 86º.

=== Electron Reflectometer and Magnetometer (MAG/ER) ===

The Magnetometer and Electron Reflectometer (collectively, MAG/ER) detected anomalous surface magnetic fields on the Moon, which are in stark contrast to a global magnetosphere (which the Moon lacks). the Moon&#x27;s overall magnetic field is too weak to deflect the solar wind, but MAG/ER discovered a small surface anomaly that can do so. This anomaly, about in diameter, has therefore been referred to as &quot;the smallest known magnetosphere, magnetosheath and bow shock system in the Solar System.&quot; Due to this and other magnetic features of the Moon&#x27;s surface, hydrogen deposited by solar wind is non-uniformly distributed, being denser at the periphery of the magnetic features. Since hydrogen density is a desirable characteristic for hypothetical lunar bases, this information may be useful in choosing optimal sites for possible long-term Moon missions.

The electron reflectometer (ER) and magnetometer (MAG) were designed to collect information on the lunar magnetic fields. the Moon has no global magnetic field, but it does have weak localized magnetic fields at its surface. These may be paleomagnetic remnants of a former global magnetic field, or may be due to meteor impacts or other local phenomena. This experiment was to help map these fields and provide information on their origins, allow possible examination of distribution of minerals on the lunar surface, aid in a determination of the size and composition of the lunar core, and provide information on the lunar induced magnetic dipole.

The ER determined the location and strength of magnetic fields from the energy spectrum and direction of electrons. The instrument measured the pitch angles of solar wind electrons reflected from the Moon by lunar magnetic fields. Stronger local magnetic fields can reflect electrons with larger pitch angles. Field strengths as small as 0.01 nT could be measured with a spatial accuracy of about at the lunar surface. The MAG was a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer similar in design to the instrument used on Mars Global Surveyor. It could measure the magnetic field amplitude and direction at spacecraft altitude with a spatial resolution of about when ambient plasma disturbances are minimal.

The ER and the electronics package were located at the end of one of the three radial science booms on &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot;. The MAG was in turn extended further on a boom—a combined from &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; in order to isolate it from spacecraft generated magnetic fields. The ER and MAG instruments had a combined mass of and used 4.5 watts of power.

<doc id="612521" wikidata="Q190608" url="?curid=612521" title="Rui Costa">
<text>Rui Manuel César Costa (; born 29 March 1972) is a Portuguese former professional footballer who is the 34th president of sports club S.L. Benfica. He also succeeded Luís Filipe Vieira as president of the club&#x27;s SAD board of directors.

Costa spent the majority of his football career with Benfica in Portugal and Fiorentina and AC Milan in Italy. In a top-flight career spanning 17 years, he won several trophies, including one Primeira Liga title, one Taça de Portugal, one Serie A title, three Coppa Italia, one UEFA Champions League and one UEFA Super Cup. A Portuguese international, he amassed 94 caps and scored 26 goals for &quot;A Seleção&quot; and represented the country in three UEFA European Championships and one FIFA World Cup.

Costa usually played as an attacking midfielder and was particularly known for his excellent technique, playmaking ability, and eye for goal from midfield. He is regarded as one of the best midfielders in world football and one of Portugal&#x27;s best players of all time. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 as one of the 125 greatest living football players.

== Club career ==

=== Benfica ===
At age five, Costa joined the infant indoor football team of Damaia Ginásio Clube. Costa tried his luck at Benfica. Within ten minutes of training, Portugal legend Eusébio, who was supervising the youngsters, was impressed with Costa&#x27;s skills. Up until 1990, Costa played for Benfica&#x27;s youth squads. In his first full season, he was loaned to A.D. Fafe on a season-long deal.

In 1991, after the Under-21 World Cup, which Portugal won after a penalty kick scored by Costa, he returned to Benfica. In his first full season with Benfica, he was featured regularly in Benfica&#x27;s team. In his next two seasons, his role in the team would prove to be pivotal as Benfica captured two trophies. He formed a formidable midfield partnership with João Vieira Pinto. During his last two seasons with Benfica in his first spell with the club, he won the Taça de Portugal in 1993 and the Portuguese First Division title in 1993–94. This would be Benfica&#x27;s last league title for the next ten seasons.

=== Fiorentina ===
At the end of his third season in Benfica&#x27;s senior squad, Fiorentina offered for the 21-year-old midfielder.

His departure from Fiorentina was discussed every season, since many clubs constantly showed interest in signing him. However, he only left Fiorentina one season before their bankruptcy in the 2001–02 season. With the Florentine club, Costa won the Coppa Italia twice, also winning a Supercoppa Italiana. In June 2001, Fiorentina agreed to sell both Costa and Francesco Toldo to Parma for 140 billion lire. Despite both players&#x27; refusal to join, Costa and Toldo were sold to AC Milan and Inter Milan, respectively, for the same total transfer fee.

=== AC Milan ===
Fatih Terim was the coach of Fiorentina in the 2000–01 season. When he was leaving Fiorentina for AC Milan, he took Costa with him, paying 85 billion lire (€43,898,836) for the player. In so doing, Costa became Milan&#x27;s most expensive transfer of all time.

On 27 September 2001, Costa scored his first goal for Milan to open a 4–0 home win (6–0 aggregate) in the first round of the UEFA Cup against BATE Borisov. He added further goals in wins over CSKA Sofia (second round) and Hapoel Tel Aviv (quarter-finals) in a run to the last four. He was hampered by injuries throughout the whole season, including a wrist injury on his debut, while his form was inconsistent. Playing away at Fiorentina, he greeted his former club&#x27;s fans in tears, which led to an angry reaction when he returned to Milan.

Ahead of his second season at Milan, Costa&#x27;s faced competition from Brazilian new signing Rivaldo, but secured a starting place against him. On 24 September 2002, he assisted three goals in a 4–0 Champions League group win at Deportivo de La Coruña, leading a television commentator to call him three times better than Zinedine Zidane. He scored his first domestic goal on 18 December, equalising in a 5–1 win (6–2 aggregate) against Ancona at the San Siro in the second leg of the last 16 of the Coppa Italia. In the 6–3 aggregate final win over Roma in May, he played only 30 minutes as a substitute as Brazilians Rivaldo and Serginho were preferred in attacking midfield. This was to rest him for the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final against Juventus, in which he was substituted injured for Massimo Ambrosini near the end of regulation time in a goalless draw that the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; won on penalties at Old Trafford. On 29 August, he played in the 1–0 victory over Porto in the 2003 UEFA Super Cup, in which he crossed for the only goal by Andriy Shevchenko.

From 2003–04, Costa&#x27;s playing time was limited by the emergent Brazilian youngster Kaká. He contributed his first three league goals to Milan&#x27;s title-winning campaign, starting with one in a 5–0 home win over Ancona on 25 January.

=== Return to Benfica ===
On 25 May 2006, Costa&#x27;s return to Benfica in the upcoming season was announced in a press conference. He had been released from Milan, after both the player and the club reached an agreement to end his €4.6 million per year contract, in order to fulfill his long-held dream of returning to Benfica. Costa started on his return in a 2006–07 UEFA Champions League qualifier against Austria Wien in August 2006, and the second leg saw Costa score in his home return. Despite Costa being used as a regular under manager Fernando Santos when available, the season was impaired with injuries: he suffered a muscle tear in October, which kept him out of action for three months, and another muscular injury in February.

Prior to the end of the season, Costa announced the following one would be his last as a professional. After assuring the qualification to the Champions League group stage, which included a brace from Costa against Copenhagen, Benfica was drawn against Costa&#x27;s former club Milan.; he returned to play one last time at the San Siro on 18 September 2007. Costa remained a first team choice under José Antonio Camacho and Fernando Chalana and his displays would earn him the SJPF Player of the Month award for September 2007 and Benfica&#x27;s Player of the Year award for 2007. Costa played his final match on 11 May 2008 at the Estádio da Luz against Vitória de Setúbal. He was substituted in the 86th minute to a standing ovation from the spectators. The season, as well as the previous one, ended trophyless.

== International career ==
===Youth and Euro 96===
Costa was part of the Portugal national under-20 team under manager Carlos Queiroz who won the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship on home soil. After a goalless draw with Brazil in the final at his club ground of the Estádio da Luz, he scored the winning penalty in the final.

On 31 March 1993, Costa made his debut for the senior national team in a 1–1 draw away to Switzerland, in 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification. In his third game on 19 June in another qualifier at home to Malta, he scored his first goal in a 4–0 win. He was part of the squad at UEFA Euro 1996 in England, where they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by runners-up the Czech Republic.

===Euro 2000===
Costa was sent off for the only time in his entire career on 6 September 1997, in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier away to Germany. While being substituted, he was shown a red card by referee Marc Batta for leaving the pitch too slowly, meaning that Portugal could not bring Sérgio Conceição on as a replacement. Minutes after the dismissal, the Germans equalised through Ulf Kirsten, meaning that they and not the Portuguese would go to the final tournament in France. Costa said on the 20th anniversary of the controversy that he would only forgive Batta if he apologised to the Portuguese nation.

In UEFA Euro 2000 qualification, Costa scored six times in home and away victories over Liechtenstein (two each) and Hungary. At the finals in Belgium and the Netherlands, he assisted the last two goals by João Pinto and Nuno Gomes in a 3–2 comeback win over England in a run to the semi-finals.

===2002 World Cup and Euro 2004===
Portugal were eliminated at the group stage in the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea. Costa was dropped for Pinto after a shock 3–2 opening loss to the United States, but came on as a substitute in the next game and finished Capucho&#x27;s cross to conclude a 4–0 win over Poland.

Before UEFA Euro 2004 on home soil, Costa and Luís Figo criticised the decision of manager Luiz Felipe Scolari to select his Brazilian compatriot Deco – a player in Costa&#x27;s same position. After being substituted at half time in another shock opening loss, this time to Greece, Costa was dropped for Deco in the next match against Russia. He came off the bench in that game and finished a Cristiano Ronaldo cross to secure a 2–0 victory. In the quarter-finals against England, again as a substitute, he scored a long-range goal in extra time as the game finished 2–2 and went to penalties; he missed in the shootout but his team prevailed.

Costa retired from international football after the unexpected defeat to the Greeks again in the Euro 2004 final. He scored 26 goals in 94 games, making him ninth-highest capped player and seventh-highest goalscorer.

== Style of play ==
Costa is considered by pundits to have been one of the greatest midfielders both of his generation, as well as one of Portugal&#x27;s best players ever, and was regarded as one of the best playmakers in the world in his prime. A classic number 10, he usually played in a creative role as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers, but was also capable of playing in midfield as a deep-lying playmaker, as a second striker, or as a winger. A quick, technically gifted and elegant player, throughout his career, he was renowned for his excellent dribbling skills, close control, intelligent movement, vision, and precise passing, which made him an effective assist provider, and enabled him to create space for his teammates, or orchestrate his teams&#x27; attacking moves. Although he was mainly known to be a creative team player, he also possessed an eye for goal from midfield, and was an accurate striker of the ball with either foot, in particular from outside the area. He was also an accurate free kick and penalty taker. Despite his talent and ability, however, he was also known for being inconsistent.

== Media ==
Costa was sponsored by American sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In 1996, he starred in a Nike commercial titled &quot;Good vs Evil&quot; in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Appearing alongside football players from around the world, including Ronaldo, Paolo Maldini, Eric Cantona, Luís Figo and Patrick Kluivert, they defend &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; against a team of demonic warriors, before it culminates with Cantona striking the ball and destroying evil. Rui Costa features in EA Sports&#x27; FIFA football video game series; he was included in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 16&quot;.

== Post-playing career ==

=== Sporting director ===
The day after his last professional match, Costa was presented as director of football at Benfica. During the summer 2008 transfer window, Costa brought head coach Quique Sánchez Flores, playmaker Pablo Aimar, winger José Antonio Reyes, and striker David Suazo, the latter two on loan. The following Summer, Costa tried to strengthen the team after a disappointing league campaign the previous season; he signed striker Javier Saviola, attacking midfielder Ramires, and defensive midfielder Javi García, led by manager Jorge Jesus. Benfica would win the 2009–10 Primeira Liga, the first league title since 2004–05, and the Taça da Liga that season, defeating Porto in the final.

=== Administration ===
On 14 May 2008, Costa was appointed an administrator of Benfica SAD. For the 2020–24 quadrennial, he became a vice-president of the club&#x27;s board of directors, as part of Luís Filipe Vieira&#x27;s list for a sixth consecutive mandate. After acting as interim president of the club and its SAD from 9 July 2021, in the aftermath of Vieira suspending his presidency due to arrest in operation &quot;Cartão Vermelho&quot; (Red Card), Costa was elected the 34th president of Benfica on 9 October, assuming office the following day. With 84.48% of the votes, he defeated candidate Francisco Benitez, who received 12.24%.

During election campaign, Costa had pledged, among other promises, a forensic audit of the club&#x27;s SAD (released in June 2024), a revision of the club&#x27;s statutes (the board&#x27;s first proposal, criticized by the Commission for Revision of the Statutes, was made available on 14 July 2023 and is open for discussion and improvement suggestions by club members), transparency regarding football transfers, retention of players &quot;made in Seixal&quot;, a reduction of the number of players, a maximum wage for players, and improvements to Estádio da Luz.

Including his interim role, the men&#x27;s football team was trophyless under his first year of presidency. Back in January 2022, Costa had said that his signature on player contracts under investigation by authorities in &quot;Cartão Vermelho&quot; did not imply he was in collusion with anyone. During the 2022–23 winter transfer window, Costa promised not to release central midfielder Enzo Fernández unless a club paid the player&#x27;s buyout clause, but Fernández left Benfica via negotiation on 31 January 2023, with Benfica paying to &quot;intermediary services&quot; for the transfer. After signing with Roger Schmidt, Benfica&#x27;s first non-Portuguese manager since Flores, the club won the 2022–23 Primeira Liga, ending a four-year trophy wait. Benfica started the next season by winning the Portuguese Super Cup, but failed to win any other trophy, despite an investment of €100 million.

== Personal life ==
Costa was married to Rute from 1994 to 2013, and fathered two sons. The elder, Filipe, is CEO of Footlab, a football agency, while the younger, Hugo, is a footballer.

<text>The Ryongchŏn disaster was a train disaster that occurred on 22 April 2004 in the town of Ryongchŏn, North Korea, near the border with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. At least 54 people were killed, including some Syrian scientists.

The disaster occurred when flammable cargo exploded at Ryongchon Station at around 13:00 local time (04:00 GMT). The news was released by South Korean media outlets, which reported that up to 3,000 people had been killed or injured in the blast and subsequent fires. The North Korean government declared a state of emergency in the region, but little information has been made public by the North Korean government. Shortly after the accident, the North Korean government cut telephone lines to the outside world.

As of 2024, it remains the second-deadliest rail accident in North Korea, and the third-deadliest in Korean history, being surpassed by the Gupo Mugunghwa-Ho Derailment (South Korea) and the Dancheon train disaster (North Korea).

==Effects==
The Red Cross was allowed into the area, in an unusual concession from the North Korean authorities, becoming the only outside agency to see the disaster area. According to the initial agency report, 160 people were killed and 1,300 were injured in the disaster. However, official casualty reports the following day listed 54 deaths and 1,249 injuries. A wide area was reported to have been affected, with some airborne debris reportedly falling across the border in China. (Satellite pictures published by the BBC purported to show widespread damage in the town, but these were later retracted; they actually show Baghdad from an earlier date, and the strong black-white contrast was misinterpreted.) The Red Cross reported that 1,850 houses and buildings had been destroyed and another 6,350 had been damaged.

On 23 April 2004, the United Nations received an appeal for international aid from North Korea&#x27;s government. The following day, a few diplomats and aid workers were allowed into the country to assess the disaster.

==Cause==
The cause and nature of the accident have been the subject of considerable speculation, with several different accounts being reported.
* It was initially reported that the explosion was the result of a collision between two trains carrying gasoline (petrol) and liquified petroleum gas, possibly donated by China to alleviate the ongoing North Korean fuel shortage.
* Diplomats and aid workers in North Korea later suggested that the explosion took place when explosive materials were being shunted in rail cars, possibly being triggered by a collision with a live electric power cable. This is corroborated by reports by North Korean officials to Russia&#x27;s Itar-Tass news agency, and by government sources to Japan&#x27;s Kyodo news service. The material was said to be intended for use in canal construction. The official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that there had been a leak of ammonium nitrate, a substance which is used in some explosives, as a fertilizer, and in rocket fuel. The &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; attributed the disaster to &quot;the explosion of a train carrying ammonium nitrate&quot;.
KCNA, the state news service, apparently confirmed the Xinhua report by stating the incident was &quot;due to the electrical contact caused by carelessness during the shunting of wagons loaded with ammonium-nitrate fertilizer&quot;.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-il passed through the station several hours before the explosion as he returned from a meeting in China. It was suggested that the explosion might have been an assassination attempt, but South Korean intelligence services believed that it was an accident. One theory is that one of the trains involved was carrying fuel from China. If the incident did involve a train collision, it has been suggested that the cause of the accident may have been a miscommunication related to the changes in train timetables due to Kim Jong-il&#x27;s itinerary.

Other observers have suggested that the poor state of North Korea&#x27;s railway system may have contributed to the disaster. It accounts for about 90% of freight transport; a lack of fuel forces most vehicles off roads. The railway, built by the Japanese during their occupation of the country, is reported to be in poor repair, with elderly rolling stock running no faster than (in part due to the poor state of North Korea&#x27;s electrical supply).

==North Korean government response==
According to North Korean defector Thae Yong-ho, Kim Jong-il ordered the execution of several transport officials after the disaster.

<doc id="612526" wikidata="Q5496844" url="?curid=612526" title="Freddy (weather)">
<text>Freddy is an animated weatherman. The short animated series covers 20 different weather conditions, complete with sound effects. It is currently shown in Hong Kong on the TVB television channel during the weather report. Freddy&#x27;s purpose is to show the next day&#x27;s predicted weather. Freddy was created in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and TVB pays license fees for his continual use.

==Appearance==
Freddy wears a yellow suit and has a pink face; his design has not generally changed over the years.

==Freddy and the weather==
Freddy&#x27;s actions gives a short forecast of the day&#x27;s weather:
* For extreme heat, he melts;
* For lightning, he gets struck by lightning and runs away;
* For rain, a rain cloud drifts in and he opens his umbrella;
* For heavy rain, the rain fills the screen;
* For strong winds, he is blown away;
* For cold, he turns to ice;
* For fog, he holds up a lantern for light.
* For sunny conditions, a flower sprouts, he picks it and walks.

At the same time, there are various sound effects including falling rain, thunder, blowing wind, footsteps, and Freddy&#x27;s whistling and reactive cries such as &quot;oooh&quot;, &quot;aaah&quot; and &quot;awww&quot;.

==Other markets==
Freddy (also known as &quot;Freddy Forecast&quot; or &quot;Freddy the Forecaster&quot;) has been shown in 19 television markets in the United States, such as KNOE-TV in Monroe, Louisiana; KTVO TV in Kirksville, Missouri; WJBF in Augusta, Georgia and many other stations. The series also ran in Perth, Australia for many years.

In Shenzhen, China, Shenzhen Television&#x27;s news bulletin at noon uses a similar character and features Shenzhen&#x27;s skyline in the background.

===Hong Kong (TVB)===

In Hong Kong, where Freddy is known as () in Cantonese and Mandarin, the character is utilised on TVB&#x27;s weather forecasts, for both its English (TVB Pearl) and Chinese (TVB Jade) channels. In 1993, he became computer-animated.

The skyline behind him on TVB&#x27;s broadcasts is regularly updated to keep abreast of the ever-changing skyline of Hong Kong. It appears as if he is walking on the water surface of Victoria Harbour. As of January 2008, Freddy was upgraded to his third incarnation.

During the 1980s weather reports, in case of fine weather Freddy would pick flowers, which was criticised as an example of destroying public property. After receiving complaints, TVB changed this in the 1990s to him walking and whistling merrily.

<doc id="612534" wikidata="Q7735386" url="?curid=612534" title="Frug (dance)">
<text>The Frug ( or /frug/) was a dance craze from the mid-1960s, which included vigorous dance to pop music. It evolved from another dance of the era, the Chicken. The Chicken, which featured lateral body movements, was used primarily as a change of pace step while doing the Twist. As young dancers grew more tired they would do less work, moving only their hips while standing in place. They then started making up arm movements for the dance, which prompted the birth of the Swim, the Monkey, the Dog, the Watusi, the Mashed Potato, and the Jerk. The Frug is sometimes referred to as the Surf, Big Bea, and the Thunderbird.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; episode &quot;The Senior Play&quot; (Season 7, Episode 9) the principal of the high school is appalled by a demonstration of the Frug dance and insists it must not be included in the senior play. But with the help of Helen Crump (who demonstrates the Jitterbug from her generation) and the kids demonstrating the Charleston from the principal&#x27;s generation, he sees that the then contemporary dancing of young people is not much different from previous generations.

The movie &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1969) contains a number called &quot;The Rich Man&#x27;s Frug&quot;, a wildly energetic dance number comprising three &quot;movements&quot; (&quot;The Aloof&quot;, &quot;The Heavyweight&quot; and &quot;The Big Finish&quot;) that showcases director Bob Fosse&#x27;s distinctive choreography style, particularly his creative use of unusual poses, gestures, and arm movements. The evolution of Frug also signified maturation of theatricality in Fosse&#x27;s choreography, departing regimentation towards visual dissonance, where every dancer could perform their own moves.

In 1964, in &quot;In the Red Light: A History of the Republican Convention in 1964,&quot; published in the November 1964 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;, Norman Mailer wrote: &quot;The American mind had gone from Hawthorne and Emerson to the Frug, the Bounce, and &#x27;Walking the Dog&#x27;, from &quot;The Flowering of New England&quot; to the cerebrality of professional football in which a quarterback must have not only heart, courage, strength and grace but a mind like an I.B.M. computer.&quot; The piece is collected in Mailer&#x27;s &quot;Cannibals and Christians&quot; (1966).

Indie rock band Rilo Kiley have a song titled &quot;Frug&quot; (also about the dance) on their 1999 self-titled debut, &quot;The Initial Friend EP&quot;, and was also the band&#x27;s first music video. &quot;Frug&quot; was also included in the soundtrack to the Christina Ricci film &quot;Desert Blue&quot;, which led to the band&#x27;s heightened popularity and eventual signing to a record label. &quot;Frug&quot; was later included as the final song on the band&#x27;s B-sides and rarities compilation, &quot;Rkives&quot;.

<text>The CZ 75 is a semi-automatic pistol made by Czech firearm manufacturer ČZUB. First introduced in 1975, it is one of the original &quot;wonder nines&quot; and features a staggered-column magazine, all-steel construction, and a hammer forged barrel. It is widely distributed throughout the world and is the most common handgun in the Czech Republic.
Firearms expert Colonel Jeff Cooper considered the CZ 75, at least its original version (short rail), to be the best 9mm service pistol ever made.

==History==
===Development of CZ 75===
The armament industry was an important part of the interwar Czechoslovak economy and made up a large part of the country&#x27;s exports. However following the 1948 communist coup d&#x27;état, all heavy industry was nationalized and was cut off from its Western export market behind the Iron Curtain. While most other Warsaw Pact countries became dependent on armaments imports from the Soviet Union, most of the Czechoslovak weaponry remained domestic (for example, the Czechoslovak army used the Vz. 58 assault rifle, while other communist bloc countries used variants of the AK-47).

Following the Second World War, brothers Josef and František Koucký participated to some extent on designing all of CZUB&#x27;s post-war weapons. Kouckýs signed their designs together, using only the surname, making it impossible to determine which one of them developed particular ideas.

By 1969, František Koucký was freshly retired, however the company offered him a job on designing a new 9×19mm Parabellum pistol. Unlike during his previous work, this time he had a complete freedom in designing the whole gun from scratch. The design he developed was in many ways new and innovative (see Design details).

Although the model was developed for export purposes (the standard pistol cartridge of the Czechoslovak armed forces was the Soviet 7.62×25mm Tokarev, which was later replaced with the Warsaw Pact standard 9mm Makarov pistol cartridge), Koucký&#x27;s domestic patents regarding the design were classified as &quot;secret patents&quot;. Effectively, nobody could learn about their existence, but also nobody could register the same design in Czechoslovakia. At the same time Koucký as well as the company were prohibited from filing for patent protection abroad. Consequently, a large number of other manufacturers began offering pistols based on CZ 75 design (see Clones, copies, and variants by other manufacturers).

The first CZ 75 models manufactured between 1975 and 1979 were made of high quality forged steel, with a hammer and a hand-finished finish due to the low cost of labor in socialist Czechoslovakia.
These models, referred to as the short rail, are among the rarest among collectors (less than 14,697 examples of this quality version were manufactured between 1975 and 1979).

In order to increase its production of CZ75s at a lower cost in order to export them, the Česká Zbrojovka company looked for alternative sources of supply for the manufacture of steel frames for the pistol in the late 1970s. Negotiations on the production of pistols outside Czechoslovakia had already begun in 1977 between Merkuria (Czechoslovak exporter) and the Spanish company Alfa in Eiba. An agreement was reached in 1979 with Alfa to produce cast frames in order to increase production, at the cost of a significant reduction in finishing and lower quality steel compared to the &quot;short rail&quot; models forged in Czechoslovakia.
In March 1979, tests on these Spanish cast frames revealed cracks. This resulted in the decision to strengthen the frame and slide for the second generation design due to lower quality steel, thus changing the appearance of the pistol at the rail level, making it longer.

The first cast and manufactured carcasses arrived in Spain in January 1980. Although this cooperation did not meet expectations, it helped CZ to increase its production considerably in the early 1980s. By the mid-1980s, however, CZ had stopped using the Spanish source.
Not satisfied with the Spanish frames, the CZ company managed to perfect their own manufacturing process on a larger scale, developing their own in-house casting facilities, and new guns from this point on were machined from cast frames, a method they still use today.

The pistol was not sold in Czechoslovakia until 1985, when it became popular among sport shooters. It was adopted by the Czech armed forces only after the Velvet Revolution in 1989.

===Development of sport variants of CZ 75===
The increasing popularity of the IPSC competitions in the Czech Republic led to the inception of CZUB&#x27;s factory team in 1992. Initially, the sport shooters were using CZ 75s and CZ 85s. Stanislav Křižík designed a new version called &quot;CZ 75 Champion&quot; already in 1992. This version had a SA trigger, a muzzle brake and adjustable weights. 150 weapons were initially made in 9×19mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W and 9×21mm. The design was further modified (i.e. the adjustable weights were eliminated, a new compensator was developed), however its main shortcoming of the same capacity as the standard CZ 75 magazines (15/16 in 9mm, 12 in .40 S&amp;W) remained.

The &quot;CZ 75 ST (Standard)&quot; and &quot;CZ 75 M (Modified)&quot; were introduced in 1998. These had a different frame from standard versions allowing for more modifications. While the ST had become very successful, M was not initially designed for use with red-dot sights, the use of which led to limited lifespan of its frame.

The popular ST version was further developed mostly with aim of prolonging its lifespan, which led to introduction of &quot;CZ 75 TS (Tactical Sports)&quot; in 2005. It uses a longer barrel (132 mm) and has also a higher weight (1,285 g) compared to the standard model. High-capacity magazines may use either 20 of the 9mm rounds or 17 of the .40 rounds. As of 2013, the model is used by the CZUB&#x27;s factory shooters in the IPSC Standard division, with a custom-made version &quot;CZ 75 Tactical Sports Open&quot; being also available.

In 2009, the sale of &quot;CZ 75 TS Czechmate&quot; began. The model is a development of the CZ 75 TS Open, available in 9×19mm Parabellum and 9×21mm with magazine capacity of 20 or 26 rounds. As standard, the gun is sold with US made C-More Systems&#x27; red-dot sight. CZUB claims that its factory shooter Martin Kameníček had shot 150,000 rounds through the gun in five years, in which time he only needed to change the barrel once in order to maintain precision.

==Design details==
The CZ 75 is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses the Browning linkless cam locking system similar to that used in the Browning Hi-Power pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked together on firing, using locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of the slide. An enclosed cam track integral with the barrel is actuated by the slide release lever&#x27;s transverse pin. After the first few millimetres of the recoil stroke, the barrel is cammed downwards at the rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the spent cartridge.

The CZ 75 was one of the first Wonder Nine handguns; most models have double-action/single action triggers and feature a frame-mounted manual safety. This allows the CZ 75 to be carried with the hammer cocked with safety applied and a round chambered, ready for use simply by switching the safety off, a configuration known as &quot;condition 1&quot;. The hammer must be dropped manually by pulling the trigger while lowering the hammer with the firer&#x27;s thumb under control to uncock the hammer for a double-action first shot. Once lowered in this manner, a double-action first shot can be achieved in a similar manner to other double-action pistols without actuating any controls. Subsequent shots will be single-action unless the hammer is again manually lowered. Some recent models have a decocking lever that doubles as a manual safety.

The CZ 75&#x27;s slide rides inside its frame rails rather than outside, similar to the SIG P210. The original models produced from 1975 to 1980 featured a distinctively shorter, 115mm long slide rails. The frames on these first model or &quot;short rail&quot; pistols were forged. Starting in 1980, CZUB modified the design by lengthening the slide rails to 140mm, transitioned to lower cost cast frames, and introduced a &quot;half-cock&quot; safety notch on the hammer to prevent it from inadvertently striking the firing pin during manual manipulation. These changes resulted in the basic mold of all subsequent CZ 75 models.

Starting in the mid-1990s, the CZ 75 was updated to the B model, chiefly with the addition of a firing pin block. Almost all CZ 75 models produced after this time, excepting some competition models, employ this safety feature.

==Variants==

===75 Steel Full Size===
;CZ 75 &quot;First Model&quot; or &quot;Short Rail&quot;: The original CZ 75, produced from 1975 to 1980 and distinctly marked by the shorter slide rails, forged frame, and lack of a half-cocked hammer position. Total production around 20,000.
;CZ 75 &quot;Pre-B&quot;: Produced from 1980 to 1993, introduced longer slide rails, cast frame, and half-cocked hammer.

===Competition===

;CZ 75 SP-01/SP-01 Tactical: Similar to the P-01 with accessory rail, but with all-steel construction and utilizing the full-size frame and slide as well as incorporating extended-capacity 18-round magazines. It is available with an ambidextrous manual safety (SP-01) or with an ambidextrous decocker (SP-01 Tactical). The CZ 75 (SP-01) was designed for multiple purposes including but not limited to: a military/law enforcement duty sidearm, sidearm for counter-terrorism forces, and field/target shooting. Used in the 2005 IPSC World Shoot XIV by World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in the production division).
;CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow: New generation of CZ 75 SP-01 pistol especially adapted according to suggestions as proposed by users from communities worldwide, with an additional input from the Team CZ shooters Angus Hobdell and Adam Tyc. Based on the SP-01, it has no firing pin block resulting in improved trigger travel. It also features a slightly reshaped grip and safety, a “weaker” recoil spring for easier loading, and fiber optic front sight and tactical “Novak style” rear sight.
;CZ 75 Shadow 2: In 2016, with the cooperation of the elite IPSC shooters of the Česká zbrojovka team, an improved version of the Shadow was released, called the Shadow 2. It included a longer barrel, a reshaped, lighter-weight slide, more aggressive slide serrations, improved grip ergonomics, aggressive grip checkering, and a smaller fiber optic in the front sight.

;CZ 75 SP-01 Phantom: The CZ 75 Phantom has a polymer frame, is 33% lighter than steel frame models, with accessory rail and a forged steel slide with a weight saving scalloped profile. Two Interchangeable grip rear strap inserts are included with the Phantom to accommodate users with different sized hands. The pistol is further outfitted with a decocking lever. Czech Army Paratroopers of the 4th Rapid Deployment Brigade are fully equipped with this pistol from January 2012.
;CZ 75 Standard IPSC: A CZ 75 variant designed specifically for IPSC competition with extended grip, single-action trigger, heavy-duty free-falling magazines, and an enlarged magazine well.
;CZ 75 Tactical Sport: Replacing the ST IPSC was the tactical sports model, which featured minor improvements over its very similar predecessor. Available in 9×19mm (20 rounds) or .40 S&amp;W (17 rounds). Discontinued in 2018. 
;CZ 75 Champion: A competition version designed for Open Division IPSC competition, with three port compensator, adjustable trigger, extended magazine release, ambidextrous safeties, fully adjustable sights and two-tone finish, with blued slide and satin nickel frame.

;CZ 75 Kadet/Kadet 2: A .22 LR caliber slide/ barrel assembly and magazine kit to fit onto most standard CZ 75B frames (except the Tactical Sport and SP-01 Phantom). The Kadet also used to be sold as a complete pistol (slide assembly and frame), but is now only sold as a slide assembly to be mounted on existing frames. The 2nd generation conversion kit currently being sold is called the &quot;Kadet 2&quot;, and includes a dedicated .22 slide stop that locks the slide back on an empty magazine. Night sights are optional.

===Polymer===
;CZ P-07 Duty: The CZ P-07 Duty is a compact, polymer-framed CZ 75 variant notable for having a redesigned trigger mechanism. The redesign has reduced the number of parts as well as improved the trigger pull. The exterior restyling was greatly influenced by the SPHINX 3000 design (itself being an enhanced Swiss CZ 75 clone). Chambered in 9mm Luger and .40 S&amp;W, the CZ P-07 DUTY also includes the ability to change the manual safety to a decocking lever and vice versa through an exchange of parts. Introduced in 2009.
;CZ P-09 Duty: Full-size version of the P-07, boasting 19 round capacity in 9mm. Introduced in 2013. 
;CZ P-09 Kadet: A .22 LR caliber slide/barrel assembly and magazine kit to fit onto standard CZ P-09 frames, similar to the CZ 75 Kadet/Kadet 2. The Kadet is sold as a complete pistol (slide assembly with frame) or a standalone slide assembly to be mounted on existing frames, and can be used as a training gun for the standard P-09. The frame is made from mechanically and thermally stable polymer reinforced with glass fibre, equipped with an underside MIL-STD-1913 rail for accessories. The slide has two pairs of cocking grooves for comfortable handling, and adjustable iron sights. The gun has easy-to-change manual safety and decocking controls, with three interchangeable grip backstraps in small, medium and large sizes.

;CZ 85B: A CZ 85 with a firing pin block
;CZ 85BD: A CZ 85 B with a decocking lever, instead of a safety
;CZ 85 Compact: A limited production compact CZ 85 with under-barrel accessory rail and chambered in .40 S&amp;W. Identical to the current CZ 75 compact in .40 S&amp;W.
;CZ 85 Combat: adds an adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. Lacks a firing pin safety so that firing pins can be replaced without special fitting.

===97 (.45 ACP)===
;CZ 97B: .45 ACP version of the CZ 75 B
;CZ 97 BD: .45 ACP version of the CZ 75 BD

===Others===
;CZ 75 Automatic: A selective-fire variant introduced in 1992 intended for law enforcement and military use.

<doc id="612541" wikidata="Q6685436" url="?curid=612541" title="Lou Castro">
<text>Luis Miguel Castro (November 25, 1876 – September 24, 1941), nicknamed &quot;Jud&quot; and &quot;Count&quot;, was a professional baseball infielder who was born in Medellín, Colombia. He is considered the first Latin American to play in recognized Major League Baseball. Castro was a second baseman who played 42 games with the Philadelphia Athletics in their pennant-winning 1902 season.

== Early life ==
Luis Miguel Castro was born to Nestor Castro, a banker, and Inez Agnes Vasquez in Medellín on November 25, 1876. Castro&#x27;s father fled the country during a of civil war; that experience was apparently traumatic for the young Castro, who told a Philadelphia reporter in 1902 (during another period of civil war) that he would &quot;never go back home&quot; because of the political violence. &quot;If they don’t have a rebellion every few months the whole country gets an impatient idea that something has gone wrong. Then they begin a revolution to right it.&quot;

Castro attended Manhattan College, a Catholic school, then located in Harlem. In 1895, at 18, he joined the college&#x27;s Manhattan Jaspers baseball team, playing as a right-handed utility infielder, outfielder, and even as a pitcher; he was named by Sporting Life as one of the top college players on the East Coast by 1898.

== Career ==
Castro was signed by Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack while he was playing semi-pro ball in the Connecticut League. He was a replacement for Nap Lajoie, whose contract with the Athletics had been challenged in court by the cross-town Philadelphia Phillies; when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court barred Lajoie from playing for any other team in the state, the future Hall-of-Famer was traded to the Cleveland Bronchos, and Castro was called up as his replacement.

In his brief 42-game stint with the Athletics, he posted a .245 batting average, with one home run and 15 runs batted in, 35 hits, 18 runs scored, 8 doubles, 1 triple and two stolen bases in 143 at bats. Castro proved a decent hitter but a poor defender, and played sparingly through the second half of the season. Nevertheless, the Athletics would eventually win the American League pennant, and Castro, well-liked among his teammates, reportedly took it upon himself to act as master of ceremonies at the team&#x27;s celebratory banquet.

Castro was released by the Athletics in 1903. He played in the Eastern League (today&#x27;s International League), first with the Rochester Bronchos, who later traded him to the Baltimore Orioles; Castro hit .329 and led the league in triples (23). The next year he signed a $2,000 contract with the Portland Browns of the Pacific Coast League, briefly acting as team captain. On the West Coast, his foreign ancestry was more apparent, with one California newspaper describing him as walking &quot;like a Mexican.&quot; Nevertheless, he was relatively well-liked and well known for his genial demeanor and practical jokes.

Castro played for various teams in the American Association and Southern Association, and managed teams in the South Atlantic and Virginia Leagues.

== Ancestry ==
During his playing career, newspapers variously described Castro as being Colombian, Spanish, Mexicans, Venezuelan, and Cuban. Castro himself was vague about his ancestry. In 1902, he claimed to be the nephew of Venezuela&#x27;s then-president, Cipriano Castro, earning him the sobriquet &quot;The President of Venezuela&quot;; he later denied the relationship in 1909 after President Castro had been deposed.

Castro applied for U.S. citizenship on July 10, 1917, noting his birthplace as Medellin, Colombia. However, in subsequent documents (a 1922 passport application and the 1930 US census) he listed his birthplace as New York. This has led to confusion about his birthplace. Baseball researcher Gary Ashwill suggests that Castro was not granted citizenship and, fearing reprisal, lied about his American birth from that point on. It is also possible that it was to receive economic benefits in his old age, as he did from the Association of Professional Baseball Players of America in 1937. What is clear is that Castro probably wanted to pass for an American citizen by birth.

Several baseball databases such as Baseball Reference and Baseball Almanac originally reflected his birthplace as New York, but the discovery of the ship&#x27;s information and passenger list provides a solid and perhaps irrefutable proof about his immigration to America. Despite the fact that he was not the first player who was brought by a team to play in the Major Leagues, Castro is recognized and credited as the first Major League Baseball player ever born in a Latin American country.

== Death and legacy ==
Castro died in New York City at the age of 64. 

He was buried with no tombstone at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Flushing, Queens, New York. According to the Society for American Baseball Research, Castro is at Division 10, row 9, number 18 in this cemetery. On July 20, 2021, Queens State Senator Jessica Ramos unveiled a new tombstone for Castro on Colombian Independence Day at the cemetery.

<doc id="612544" wikidata="Q578738" url="?curid=612544" title="Marty Turco">
<text>Marty Vincent Turco (born August 13, 1975) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played 11 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played nine seasons with the Dallas Stars and one season each with the Chicago Blackhawks and Boston Bruins. Due to his puck-handling prowess, Canadian hockey personality Don Cherry named Turco &quot;the smartest goalie in the NHL&quot;. Turco currently serves as an in-studio analyst at NHL Network.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
After playing minor hockey for the S.S. Marie Legion program in his hometown, Turco was undrafted by the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He signed as a 17-year-old with the Cambridge Winterhawks Jr. B. team in 1992 and played two seasons with the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) team before accepting an NCAA scholarship to play college hockey for the University of Michigan, a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). At Michigan, Turco won two NCAA championships.

Turco was drafted in the fifth round of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the Dallas Stars and went on to play for Michigan that fall. Turco earned many awards in his four years at Michigan, including Rookie of the Year in 1995, Tournament MVP in 1998 and nominations to the first All-Star team in 1997, the second All-Star team in 1998 and the All-Tournament Team in 1996 and 1998. After graduating, Turco went to play for Dallas&#x27; International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Kalamazoo Wings. In 1999, he was named IHL Rookie of the Year.

===Dallas Stars===
After two years playing for the K-Wings, Turco was given the opportunity to be a backup for Ed Belfour in Dallas. He spent the next two years with the Stars gaining experience as the team&#x27;s backup. After the 2001–02 season, Dallas decided to make Turco the starting goaltender, allowing Belfour to sign with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

In his first year as the starting goaltender, 2002–03, Turco&#x27;s goals against average (GAA) of 1.72 set a modern NHL record. (Miikka Kiprusoff broke Turco&#x27;s record the next season with a 1.69 GAA.) Turco played in the NHL All-Star Game during the season and was named to the second All-Star team following the season, finishing second in Vezina Trophy voting as well, behind Martin Brodeur, for the NHL&#x27;s top regular season goaltender. His .932 save percentage was also best in the NHL that year. However, he was unable to lead the Stars past the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the Western Conference Semifinals of the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs.

During the 2003–04 season, Turco continued to give the Stars quality goaltending, again playing (and starting) in the All-Star Game. The Stars lost to the Colorado Avalanche in the first round of the 2004 playoffs.

In the 2005–06 season, Turco won a career-best 41 games, eight of them in shootouts. Turco&#x27;s experience in the 2006 playoffs was similar to the prior season, again losing in five games to the Avalanche.

On April 13, 2007, in the Stars&#x27; first and only playoff series of the 2006–07 season, Turco recorded his first ever playoff shutout against the Vancouver Canucks to tie the series 1–1. After the game, he said, &quot;We know we can beat these guys here [Vancouver], or at home, or anywhere.&quot;

Turco went on to lose against the Canucks at home in Game 3, dropping a 2–1 overtime victory, when Taylor Pyatt got a quick one-time shot off a feed from Bryan Smolinski. In Game 4, once again the Stars could not put up a win, losing to the Canucks 2–1 off of goals from Mattias Öhlund, then the game winner from Trevor Linden. The Stars then went on to win Game 5 in the series with 1–0 overtime win. Brenden Morrow scored the game&#x27;s only goal 6:22 into the first overtime period, allowing Turco to earn his second career playoff shutout. Turco followed this up with his third shutout of the series in a 2–0 win. The series ended on April 23, 2007, with a score of 4–1 in favor of Vancouver, with Trevor Linden again scoring the eventual game-winner in the second period.

The three shutouts posted by Turco in that series represent a record amount of shutouts in a single playoff series, a mark that has been tied by the New Jersey Devils&#x27; Martin Brodeur, Anaheim&#x27;s Jean-Sébastien Giguère and the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; Michael Leighton.

Turco recorded 32 wins in the 2007–08 season and helped the Stars to playoff wins over the defending Stanley Cup champions Anaheim and the San Jose Sharks, before losing in six games to the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals.

On January 15, 2009, Turco recorded his 421st game for the Stars, becoming the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in games played by a goaltender, surpassing Cesare Maniago&#x27;s near 33-year old record of 420. He would also pass Maniago later that month in total minutes played, on January 29, while also winning his first regular season game at Joe Louis Arena in 11 tries against the Detroit Red Wings. On February 9, he again broke yet another of Maniago&#x27;s records by starting in his 24th consecutive game in goal. However, the Stars failed to qualify for the playoffs. On April 13, 2010, it was reported Turco would not be re-signed by Dallas, ending his nine years with the Stars.

===Chicago Blackhawks===

On August 2, 2010, Turco signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the reigning Stanley Cup champion, the Chicago Blackhawks, replacing Antti Niemi as their starting goaltender. The Blackhawks had previously beaten the Philadelphia Flyers in six games in the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals. His first win with Chicago came on October 15, a 5–2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. As the 2010–11 season went on, Corey Crawford would take over as the starting goaltender. Turco ultimately saw action in 29 games, compiling an 11–11–3 record.

===EC Red Bull Salzburg===

In December 2011, Turco signed a contract with EC Red Bull Salzburg of the Austrian Erste Bank Eishockey Liga (EBEL). It was a short-term contract and Turco was only expected to play December 16 and 18 in the European Trophy Finals/Red Bull Salute. However, the following month, he signed a subsequent contract with EC Salzburg lasting through the end of the EBEL season, including an &quot;NHL-out&quot; clause that lasted until the NHL trade deadline, which occurred on February 27.

===Boston Bruins===
On March 5, 2012, Turco signed a contract with the Boston Bruins. He cleared waivers on March 7 and joined the Bruins. He was signed after it was learned that the Bruins&#x27; back-up goaltender, Tuukka Rask, would be out four-to-six weeks with a lower abdominal strain. Because he was signed after the NHL trade deadline, Turco was not eligible to participate in the 2012 playoffs.

==International play==
Turco played for Team Canada at the 2002 World Championship, he won a silver medal in 2005 but did not play. He suited up at the 2006 Winter Olympics as a third goalie.

Turco would play for Canada at the 2011 Spengler Cup.

==Television==
Before signing with EC Salzburg, Turco worked as an analyst for the NHL Network, providing in-studio analysis during the show &quot;On the Fly&quot;. Turco joined NHL Network&#x27;s team after the Blackhawks were eliminated by the Vancouver Canucks during the 2011 playoffs. Turco said a full-time job in television might be in his future, but that he would like to play again and was not ready to retire. Turco joined Team Canada for the 2011 Spengler Cup after not playing regularly for nine months.

Turco also appeared in two commercials for the NHL. In a 2006 commercial for the NHL&#x27;s &quot;Game On!&quot; promotion, Turco can be seen in back of a family&#x27;s car to remind the father that the NHL season is starting. Turco can also be seen in the NHL&#x27;s &quot;Road Trip&quot; commercial, which was debuted during the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas. Turco can be seen sleeping as fellow goaltenders Roberto Luongo and Ryan Miller set him up to cover himself in shaving cream as a result of a prank.

==Personal life==
Turco and his wife Kelly have two daughters, Hailey (born early 2002) and Katelyn (born April 2004), and one son, Finley (born August 2008).

<text>Richard Morris Hunt (October 31, 1827 – July 31, 1895) was an American architect of the nineteenth century and an eminent figure in the history of architecture of the United States. He helped shape New York City with his designs for the 1902 entrance façade and Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s Fifth Avenue building, the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;), and many Fifth Avenue mansions since destroyed.

Hunt is also renowned for his Biltmore Estate, America&#x27;s largest private house, near Asheville, North Carolina, and for his elaborate summer cottages in Newport, Rhode Island, which set a new standard of ostentation for the social elite and the newly minted millionaires of the Gilded Age.

==Early life==
Hunt was born at Brattleboro, Vermont into the prominent Hunt family. His father, Jonathan Hunt, was a lawyer and U.S. congressman, whose own father, Jonathan Hunt, senior, was lieutenant governor of Vermont. Hunt&#x27;s mother, Jane Maria Leavitt, was the daughter of Thaddeus Leavitt, Jr., a merchant, and a member of the influential Leavitt family of Suffield, Connecticut.

Richard Morris Hunt was named for Lieut. Richard Morris, an officer in the U.S. Navy, a son of Hunt&#x27;s aunt, whose husband Lewis Richard Morris was a U.S. Congressman from Vermont and the nephew of Gouverneur Morris, author of large parts of the U.S. Constitution. Hunt was the brother of the Boston painter William Morris Hunt, and the photographer and lawyer Leavitt Hunt.

Following the death of his father in Washington, D.C., in 1832 at the age of 44, Hunt&#x27;s mother moved her family to New Haven, then in 1837 to New York, and then in the spring of 1838 to Boston. There, Hunt enrolled in the Boston Latin School, while his brother William enrolled in Harvard College. However, in the summer of 1842, William left Harvard, transferring to a school in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, while Richard was sent to school in Sandwich, Massachusetts.

==European education==

In October 1843, out of concern for William&#x27;s health, Mrs. Hunt and her five children sailed from New York to Europe, eventually settling in Rome. There, Hunt studied art, but was encouraged by his mother and brother William to pursue architecture. In May 1844, Hunt enrolled in Mr. Briquet&#x27;s boarding school in Geneva, and the following year, while continuing to board with Mr. Briquet, arranged to study with the Geneva architect Samuel Darier.

In October 1846, Hunt entered the Paris atelier of the architect Hector Lefuel, while studying for the entrance examinations of the . According to the historian David McCullough, &quot;Hunt was the first American to be admitted to the school of architecture at the – the finest school of architecture in the world – and the subsequent importance of his influence on the architecture of his own country can hardly be overstated.&quot;

In 1853, Hunt&#x27;s mentor Lefuel was placed in charge of the ambitious project of completing the Louvre, following the death of the project&#x27;s architect, Louis-Tullius-Joachim Visconti. Lefuel engaged Hunt to help supervise the work, and to help design the &quot;Pavillon de la Bibliothèque&quot; (&quot;Library Pavilion&quot;), prominently situated opposite the Palais-Royal. Hunt would later regale the sixteen-year-old future architect Louis Sullivan with stories of his work on the &quot;Nouveau Louvre&quot; in Lefuel&#x27;s &quot;atelier libre&quot;.

==Career in America==

===New York early years===

Hunt spent Christmas 1855 in Paris, after which he returned to the United States. In March 1856, he accepted a position with the architect Thomas Ustick Walter helping Walter with the renovation and expansion of the U.S. Capitol, and the following year moved to New York to establish his own practice. Hunt&#x27;s first substantial project was the Tenth Street Studio Building, where he rented space, and where in 1858 he founded the first American architectural school, beginning with a small group of students, including George B. Post, William Robert Ware, Henry Van Brunt, and Frank Furness. Ware, who was deeply influenced by Hunt, went on to found America&#x27;s first two university programs in architecture: at MIT in 1866, and at Columbia in 1881.

Hunt&#x27;s first New York project, a pair of houses on 37th Street for Thomas P. Rossiter and his father-in-law Dr. Eleazer Parmly, required Hunt to sue Parmly for non-payment of the supervisory portion of his services. The jury awarded Hunt a 2-1/2% commission, at the time the minimum fee typically charged by architects. According to the editors of &quot;Engineering Magazine&quot;, writing in 1896, the case, &quot;helped to establish a uniform system of charges by percentage.&quot;

It was in these early years that Hunt suffered his greatest professional setback, the rejection of his formal, classical proposal for the &quot;Scholars&#x27; Gate&quot;, the entrance to New York&#x27;s Central Park at 60th Street and Fifth Avenue. According to Central Park historian Sarah Cedar Miller, the influential Central Park commissioner Andrew Haswell Green supported Hunt&#x27;s design, but when the park commissioners adopted it, the park&#x27;s designers, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux (advocates of a more informal design), protested and resigned their positions with the Central Park project. Hunt&#x27;s plan was ultimately rejected, and Olmsted and Vaux rejoined the project. Nevertheless, one work of Hunt&#x27;s can be found in the park, albeit a minor one: the rusticated Quincy granite pedestal on which John Quincy Adams Ward&#x27;s bronze statue &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; stands, on Pilgrim Hill overlooking the park&#x27;s East Drive at East 72nd Street.

Hunt&#x27;s extroverted personality, a factor in his successful career, is well-documented. After meeting Hunt in 1869 the philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in his journal of &quot;one remarkable person new to me, Richard Hunt the architect. His conversation was spirited beyond any I remember, loaded with matter, and expressed with the vigour and fury of a member of the Harvard boat or ball club relating the adventures of one of their matches; inspired, meantime, throughout, with fine theories of the possibilities of art.&quot; Hunt was said to be popular with his workmen, and legend has it that during a final walk-through of the William K. Vanderbilt house on Fifth Avenue, Hunt discovered a mysterious tent-like object in one of the ballrooms. Investigating, he found it covering a life-sized statue of himself, dressed in stonecutters&#x27; clothes, carved in secret as a tribute by the project&#x27;s stonecutters. Vanderbilt permitted the statue to be placed on the roof over the entrance to the house. Hunt was said to be pragmatic; his son Richard quoted him as having said, &quot;the first thing you&#x27;ve got to remember is that it&#x27;s your client&#x27;s money you&#x27;re spending. Your goal is to achieve the best results by following their wishes. If they want you to build a house upside down standing on its chimney, it&#x27;s up to you to do it.&quot;

Hunt&#x27;s professional trajectory gained impetus from his extensive social connections at Newport, Rhode Island, the resort where in 1859 Hunt&#x27;s brother William bought a house. There in 1860 Hunt met the woman he would marry, Catharine Clinton Howland, the daughter of Samuel Shaw Howland, a New York shipping merchant, and his wife, Joanna Hone.
On April 2, 1861, they married at the Church of the Ascension, on Fifth Avenue at Tenth street, and according to a newspaper reporter, the bride brought a dowry to the marriage of $400,000. Many of Hunt&#x27;s early wood-frame houses, and many of his later more substantial masonry houses, were built at Newport, some of the latter for the Vanderbilts, the family of railroad tycoons with whom Hunt had a long and rewarding relationship.

===New York later years===

Beginning in the 1870s, Hunt acquired more substantial commissions, including New York&#x27;s Tribune Building (built 1873–75, one of the earliest buildings with an elevator), and the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty (built 1881–86). Hunt devoted much of his practice to institutional work, including the Theological Library and Marquand Chapel at Princeton; the Fogg Museum of Art at Harvard; and the Scroll and Key clubhouse at Yale, all of which except the last have been demolished.

Before Hunt&#x27;s Lenox Library was completed in 1877 on Fifth Avenue, none of his American works were designed in the Beaux-Arts style with which he is usually associated, of which his entrance façade for the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s Fifth Avenue building (completed posthumously in 1902) is perhaps the chief example. Late in life he joined the consortium of architects selected to plan Chicago&#x27;s 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, considered to be an exemplar of Beaux-Arts design. Hunt&#x27;s design for the fair&#x27;s Administration Building won a gold medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects.

The last surviving New York City buildings entirely by Hunt are the Jackson Square Library and a charity hospital he designed for the Association for the Relief of Respectable Aged Indigent Females, completed in 1883 at Amsterdam Avenue between 103rd and 104th Streets. The red-brick building was renovated in the late 20th century and is now a youth hostel.

The Jackson Square Library, built in 1887 with funds from George Vanderbilt III (Grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt) still exists as well. This particular library — one of the first purpose-built free and open public library buildings in New York (only the Ottendorfer Library on Second Avenue in the East Village is extant and older) — was also one of the first libraries to introduce the innovation of open stacks. This allowed the public to actually pick books off the shelves themselves, rather than having to find a card number in a catalog and ask a librarian to retrieve the book for them, which was to this point standard practice, based in part upon fear of theft.  The building continued to operate as a library until it was decommissioned in the early 1960s.

===Professional advocacy===

Referring to Hunt&#x27;s efforts to elevate his chosen profession, the architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Hunt was &quot;American architecture&#x27;s first, and in many ways its greatest, statesman.&quot; In 1857, Hunt co-founded the New York Society of Architects, which soon became the American Institute of Architects, and from 1888 to 1891 served as the institute&#x27;s third president. Hunt advocated tirelessly for the improved status of architects, arguing that they should be treated, and paid, as legitimate and respected professionals equivalent to doctors and lawyers. In 1893, Hunt co-founded New York&#x27;s Municipal Art Society, an outgrowth of the City Beautiful Movement, and served as the society&#x27;s first president.

Many of Hunt&#x27;s proteges had successful careers. Among the employees who worked in his firm was the Franco-American architect and graduate Emmanuel Louis Masqueray who went on to become Chief of Design at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. Hunt encouraged artists and craftsmen, frequently employing them to embellish his buildings, most notably the sculptor Karl Bitter who worked on many of Hunt&#x27;s projects.

==Death and legacy==

Hunt died at Newport, Rhode Island in 1895, and was buried at Newport&#x27;s Common Burying Ground and Island Cemetery. In 1898, the Municipal Art Society commissioned the Richard Morris Hunt Memorial, designed by the architect Bruce Price, with a bust of Hunt and two caryatids (one representing art, the other architecture) sculpted by Daniel Chester French. The memorial was installed in the wall of Central Park along Fifth Avenue near 70th Street, across the avenue from Hunt&#x27;s Lenox Library, which has since been replaced by the Frick Collection.

Following Hunt&#x27;s death, his son Richard Howland Hunt continued the practice his father had established, and in 1901 his brother Joseph Howland Hunt joined him to form the successor firm Hunt &amp; Hunt. They completed many of their father&#x27;s projects, including the 1902 wing of The Met Fifth Avenue. The new wing (for which the father, a museum trustee, had made the initial sketches in 1894) included the Fifth Avenue entrance facade, the entrance hall and grand staircase.

<text>Ignatz Bubis (12 January 1927 – 13 August 1999), German Jewish leader, was the influential chairman (and later president) of the Central Council of Jews in Germany (&quot;Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland&quot;) from 1992 to 1999. In this capacity he led a public campaign against German antisemitism. Bubis&#x27;s high-profile both in Frankfurt and nationwide involved him in a number of public controversies.

== Life ==
Born in the formerly German city of Breslau (today Wrocław, Poland), Bubis moved with his family to Dęblin, Poland in 1935. During the Nazi occupation of Dęblin, Bubis lived in the Dęblin–Irena Ghetto before deportation to the HASAG labor camp in Częstochowa in 1944. After liberation, he moved to Dresden and later West Germany as the political situation in the Soviet zone of occupation deteriorated. He established himself in the precious metal industry, and in 1956 he moved permanently to Frankfurt am Main, where he entered the real estate business. In Frankfurt, Bubis also became active in Jewish communal politics. In 1965, he joined the executive board of the Frankfurt Jewish community and served as chairman from 1978 to 1981 and from 1983 to 1999. In 1977, he joined the executive board of the Central Council of Jews, becoming deputy chairman in 1989 and chairman in 1992, a position he held until his death.

As a real estate speculator, he drew the ire of many on the political left in the late 1960s and 1970s. Particular opponents were radical members of the students&#x27; movement and squatters&#x27; rights movement. In his posthumously produced play &quot;Der Müll, die Stadt und der Tod&quot; (&quot;Trash, the City, and Death&quot;, 1985), German playwright and director Rainer Werner Fassbinder satirized a &#x27;rich Jew&#x27; who took advantage of his Jewishness for business and political purposes. Many considered this characterization to be an oblique attack on Bubis. In response, Bubis and other members of the Frankfurt Jewish community occupied the stage of the Schaubühne Theater, preventing the play&#x27;s debut.

The Neo-Nazi band Landser has produced a song by the name of &quot;Deutsche Wut&quot; (German Wrath), which targets Ignatz Bubis.

As the outspoken leader of the Jewish community in Germany, Bubis gradually became a presence in German public life and intellectual discourse over the Nazi past. In early 1994, Bubis served on the jury for an international architectural competition for the design of the controversial Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, although he felt that a museum and learning center, rather than a monument, was more appropriate. Also in that year, the weekly newspaper &quot;Die Woche&quot; (&quot;The Week&quot;) proposed that Bubis run for German president on behalf of the Freie Demokratische Partei (Free Democratic Party, or FDP). Bubis did not pursue the nomination. In February 1998, after construction on the monument remained unfinished, he expressed outrage about the delay on behalf of all Germans. Bubis was active in Frankfurt municipal and Hessian state politics. From 1987 to 1991, he served on the board of the Hessian state FDP, and in 1997 Bubis led the FDP in a successful bid to gain representation in the Frankfurt city council. He also served on the board of Hessian state radio throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

Shortly before his death, Bubis became embroiled in two controversies. In 1998, German author Martin Walser won the Peace Prize of the German Bookdealers Association. At the award ceremony Walser&#x27;s remarks regarding the instrumentalization of Auschwitz and Holocaust memory enraged Bubis, who left the auditorium and attacked Walser in the press. After a series of well-publicized comments, Walser and Bubis met and reconciled. A few weeks before his death, Bubis, already seriously ill, claimed that Jews could not live freely in Germany. Additionally, noting the desecration of the grave of his Central Council predecessor Heinz Galinski in Berlin, Bubis requested that he be buried in Israel. At his funeral, his grave was desecrated by Israeli artist Meir Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn claimed that Bubis had &quot;exploited his Jewishness&quot;.

<text>Elwin Norris Hermanson (born August 22, 1952) is a former Canadian politician from Swift Current, Saskatchewan. He served as a member of Parliament (MP) for Kindersley—Lloydminster from 1993 to 1997 as a member of the Reform Party, and as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan for Rosetown-Elrose from 1999 to 2007 as a member of the Saskatchewan Party. Hermanson was the first permanent leader of the Saskatchewan Party and was leader of the Opposition from 1999 to 2004.

== Political career ==

=== Federal politics ===
Hermanson first ran for political office in the 1988 Canadian federal election as a member of the fledgling Reform Party, a western protest party with a platform mixing western alienation with social conservatism. The party failed to have any members elected. However, Reform surged to third-party status in the 1993 election, and Hermanson was one of four Reform MPs elected in Saskatchewan. He was the Reform Party House Leader from 1993 to 1995. Following a redistribution he ran in the 1997 election in the new riding of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar; while the Reform Party continued to attract voters, becoming the Official Opposition, Hermanson lost his seat to fellow incumbent Chris Axworthy of the New Democratic Party.

=== Saskatchewan Party ===
Following his federal election loss in 1997, Hermanson turned his attention to provincial politics. That year also saw the foundation of the Saskatchewan Party as a new conservative party in the province, bringing together former Progressive Conservatives, some Liberal members, and Reform Party organizers. Hermanson sought the leadership of the new party in 1998, facing off against Rod Gantefoer, a former Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan (MLA), and political newcomer Yogi Huyghebaert. On April 20, 1998, Hermanson was elected the first Saskatchewan Party leader in a one member, one vote election. Aware that the conservative base in the province was in rural areas, Hermanson stated that people &quot;know I have the best interests of the agriculture industry and rural Saskatchewan at heart because that&#x27;s where I still live&quot;. Hermanson did not have a seat in the legislature, and he declined to run in a 1998 Saskatoon by-election, instead waiting for the next general election to run for a seat. This left Ken Krawetz to serve as the interim House Opposition leader.

Under Hermanson, the Saskatchewan Party campaigned on an ambitious fiscal conservative platform, calling for major corporate and income tax cuts, along with a number of controversial and social conservative policies, from a commitment to consider privatizing crown corporations to work-for-welfare policies and an end to public affirmative action.

Hermanson was elected in the 1999 provincial election for Rosetown–Biggar and, leading the Saskatchewan Party to a strong performance, became Leader of the Opposition. The new party shocked the province in winning a small plurality of the popular vote, but it was completely shut out in the urban centres of Regina and Saskatoon. Ultimately, this left the Saskatchewan Party with 25 seats. However, the result reduced the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (NDP) to a minority government with 29 seats, forcing Premier Roy Romanow to form a coalition government with the remaining Liberals.

After this strong performance, Hermanson was widely expected to lead the party to victory in the next election, and the party led polling heading into 2003. The party again campaigned on a platform of tax reductions and decreased government involvement in the economy, but it remained bogged down by questions about its conservatism and its plans for crown corporations. Hermanson continued to state that he would be willing to entertain offers for the province&#x27;s crown corporations and the NDP, now led by Lorne Calvert, made this a focal point of their campaign. At one point in the campaign, Hermanson criticized the NDP for a leaked internal cartoon that depicted him as a Nazi loading NDP sympathizers onto rail cars. Ultimately, the 2003 election would prove a major disappointment for the Saskatchewan Party as the NDP won a bare majority. While Hermanson&#x27;s party made a net gain of two seats, both in Saskatoon, it was shut out of Regina once again. Hermanson resigned days after the election. However, he committed to remaining the MLA for Rosetown–Elrose. In March 2004, Hermanson was succeeded by Brad Wall when he was acclaimed the new Saskatchewan Party leader.

On June 23, 2006, Hermanson announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the legislature, marking the end of his run in provincial politics. Wall would lead the Saskatchewan Party to a majority government in the 2007 election, while party member Jim Reiter succeeded Hermanson as Rosetown–Elrose MLA.

== After politics ==
In 2007, Hermanson was appointed by the federal government to lead the Canadian Grain Commission for a five-year term beginning in January 2008.

In 2017, during the leadership race to replace Brad Wall as Saskatchewan Party leader, Hermanson was criticized for commenting on and sharing an Islamophobic article on Twitter. Leadership candidate Alanna Koch, whom Hermanson had endorsed, was among those vocally critical in response.

<text>The Titles Deprivation Act 1917 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom which authorised enemies of the United Kingdom during the First World War to be deprived of their British peerages and royal titles.

==Background==
The British royal family was closely related to many of the royal and princely families of Germany. In particular, while Victoria became queen in 1837, the Kingdom of Hanover (formerly the Electorate of Hanover), which had been in personal union with the British crown for over a century, passed to her uncle the Duke of Cumberland, who also retained his British titles and princely rank. Similarly, Queen Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, whose German titles passed eventually to the descendants of their youngest son Leopold, Duke of Albany. Thus, during World War I, both Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale were British princes and dukes, even while they were also officers in the German Army (as was the latter&#x27;s son, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, who also held British princely rank).

In Parliament, beginning on 18 November 1914, Swift MacNeill, a Protestant Irish Nationalist and constitutional scholar and MP for South Donegal, condemned the Duke of Albany and the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale as traitors and demanded to know &quot;what steps will be taken to secure that [they] shall no longer retain United Kingdom peerages and titles and a seat in the House of Lords.&quot; Despite meeting resistance from Prime Ministers Asquith and Lloyd George, MacNeil continued his campaign until he lost his seat in the 1918 election. After MacNeill lost his seat, Horatio Bottomley, Member for Hackney South, took up the charge.

On 13 May 1915, King George V struck the names of seven German and Austrian royals (some of whom had never been British) from the roll of Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Garter; but peerage titles cannot be withdrawn except by Act of Parliament. In 1917, therefore, Parliament passed the Titles Deprivation Act authorising the deprivation of peerage titles, as well as princely dignities.

==Special committee of the Privy Council==
The Act allowed the King to establish a committee of the Privy Council, which was to include at least two members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The committee was empowered to take evidence and report the names of British peers or princes &quot;who have, during the present war, borne arms against His Majesty or His Allies, or who have adhered to His Majesty&#x27;s enemies&quot;. The report would then be laid before both Houses of Parliament; if neither House passed a motion disapproving of the report within forty days, it was to be submitted to the King, and the people named would lose their British titles.

Thereafter, a successor of a person that was deprived of a peerage would be allowed to petition the Crown for the restoration of a deprived title; the petition would be referred to a committee of the Privy Council, which would recommend whether the petitioner be reinstated or not. In no event, however, did the Act &quot;affect the title or succession of any person to any estates or other property&quot;.

Under the Act, the King appointed to the committee:
*Lord Finlay (Lord Chancellor)
*Lord Sandhurst (Lord Chamberlain of the Household)
*The Marquess of Lansdowne 
*The Marquess of Crewe 
*Lord Newton
*Lord Stamfordham (Private Secretary to the Sovereign)
*Lord Sumner (a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary)

The committee was established by an Order in Council issued by the King on 27 November 1917.

The committee issued its report on 1 August 1918 and it was then laid before the Houses of Parliament. Since no resolution was passed by either House disapproving of the report, it was presented to the King on 28 March 1919, and on the same date, the King issued an Order in Council depriving the persons listed in the committee&#x27;s report of their titles.

==List of titles affected by the Act ==
By the King&#x27;s Order in Council of 28 March 1919, the following people were deprived of their titles (names listed in the form given in the Order in Council):

*His Royal Highness Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence and Baron Arklow
*His Royal Highness Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, and Earl of Armagh
*His Highness Prince Ernest Augustus of Cumberland (son and heir-apparent of the Duke of Cumberland)
*Henry, Viscount Taaffe of Corren and Baron of Ballymote

In addition to the Dukedom of Albany and the Dukedom of Cumberland and Teviotdale (the latter title being represented by two of the four people above), the title of Viscount Taaffe was also lost by its bearer. The Viscounts Taaffe had emigrated from Ireland to Austria in the 1700s and had served the Austrian emperor since that time, even while their Irish title was confirmed as recently as 1860.

No descendant of the Dukedom of Albany or the Dukedom of Cumberland and Teviotdale has ever petitioned the Crown for the revival of their titles. The last heir to the Viscount Taaffe title, Richard Taaffe, also had not petitioned the Crown before his death in 1967, when the title became extinct.

<text>Andros Island is an archipelago in The Bahamas, the largest of the Bahamian Islands. Politically considered a single island, Andros in total has an area greater than all the other 700 Bahamian islands combined. The land area of Andros consists of hundreds of small islets and cays connected by mangrove estuaries and tidal swamplands, together with three major islands: North Andros, Mangrove Cay, and South Andros. The three main islands are separated by bights, estuaries that trifurcate the island from east to west. It is long by wide at the widest point.

== Etymology ==
The indigenous Lucayan people called the island &quot;Habacoa&quot; (or &quot;Babucca&quot;) meaning &quot;large upper outer land&quot;. Originally named &quot;Espiritu Santu&quot; by the Spanish, Andros Island was given its present name sometime early during the period of British colonial rule. Several eighteenth-century British documents refer to it as Andrews Island. A 1782 map refers to the island as San Andreas.

The modern name is believed to be in honour of Sir Edmund Andros, Commander of His Majesty&#x27;s Forces in Barbados in 1672 and governor successively of New York, Massachusetts, and New England. Andros was notable for his role in the collapse of the Dominion of New England, after which he was removed from office and jailed by disgruntled colonists who took advantage of the ambiguous status of royal governors after King James II who had appointed them was deposed by William and Mary in the Glorious Revolution in England.

Secondary and tertiary sources indicate that the island may have been named after the inhabitants of St Andro Island (also called St Andrew or San Andrés) off the Mosquito Coast of Honduras, because 1,400 migrants reportedly settled in Andros in 1787. Contemporary records, including official Bahamian census figures from 1788 and 1807, indicate that the number of inhabitants of Andros in that period was fewer than 400, and the original source of this report remains obscure. Only 2,650 individuals were evacuated from the Mosquito Coast in 1787, including individuals evacuated from St. Andrews Island, and 2,214 are known to have settled in Belize. The misconception appears to stem from a misreading of the Royal Geographical Society account of the transfer of the inhabitants from St. Andrews to Andros. The 1879 report states that the descendants of the migrants living in northern Andros numbered 1,400 as of 1879, as opposed to their ancestors comprising that number in 1787 when the original migration took place.

Another theory suggests that the island was named after the Greek isle of Andros, by Greek sponge fishermen.

The theory that the island was named for Sir Edmund Andros is the most widely accepted.

== History ==
=== Pre-Columbian and Spanish eras ===
The Lucayans, a subgroup of the Taíno people, were indigenous to The Bahamas at the time of European encounter. Archeological artefacts and remains have been found in both Morgan&#x27;s Cave on North Andros, and in the Stargate Blue Hole on South Andros. The population of The Bahamas is estimated to have been approximately 40,000 Lucayan-Taínos when the Spanish arrived in the region.

Spain claimed the Bahamas after Columbus&#x27; arrival on the islands — his first landfall in the Western Hemisphere may have been on the Bahamian island of San Salvador. The Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, for whom the Americas are named, came on a Spanish charter and spent four months exploring The Bahamas in 1499–1500. He mapped a portion of the eastern shore of Andros Island.

Spanish exploitation of the labor of the natives of nearby Hispaniola rapidly reduced the population of that island, leading the Governor of Hispaniola to complain to the Spanish crown. After Columbus&#x27;s death, Ferdinand II of Aragon ordered in 1509 that Indians be imported from nearby islands to make up the population losses in Hispaniola, and the Spanish began capturing Lucayans in the Bahamas for use as laborers in Hispaniola; within two years the southern Bahamas were largely depopulated. The Spanish may have carried away as many as 40,000 Lucayans by 1513. A 1520 expedition by the Spanish discovered only 11 people in The Bahamas; the Lucayans were effectively eradicated from these islands. The islands of the Bahamas, including Andros Island, remained uninhabited thereafter for approximately 130 years.

The Bahamas subsequently passed back and forth between Spanish and British rule for 150 years. Britain gained control following the American Revolutionary War by treaty in 1783, when it exchanged East Florida with Spain for The Bahamas.

=== British colonial era 1648–1973 ===
In 1648 English settlers from Bermuda established a colony on Eleuthera. In 1666 the English founded Charles Town — later renamed Nassau — on New Providence.

During the late 1600s and 1700s, various pirates and buccaneers frequented Andros Island. In 1713 the Bahama Islands were declared a Republic of Pirates. Morgan&#x27;s Bluff and Morgan&#x27;s Cave on North Andros are named after the famous privateer-pirate, Henry Morgan, for whom Captain Morgan&#x27;s Spiced Rum is named. It is said that the Andros settlement of Small Hope Bay was so named because Morgan claimed there would be &quot;small hope&quot; of anybody finding the treasure he had hidden there. Pirates raiding the Spanish treasure galleons out of Cuba maintained a settlement on South Andros.

Loyalists fleeing the United States during and after the American Revolution settled on various Bahama Islands including Andros, bringing their slaves with them. In addition, Andros was the destination of many families who were squeezed out of the Belize logwood industry following the relocation of Mosquito Coast settlers to British Honduras in 1787. By 1788 the population of all The Bahamas was reported as 3,000 whites and 8,000 blacks. The 1788 census for Andros reported 22 white heads of families, with a total of 132 slaves; they cultivated of land.

After the United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1821, some Seminoles and black American slaves escaped and sailed to the west coast of Andros by the wrecking sloop &quot;Steerwater,&quot; where they established the settlement of Red Bays. Hundreds of Black Seminoles and slaves travelling in 1823 by canoe and 27 sloops across the Gulf Stream joined them, with more arriving in later years. While sometimes called &quot;Black Indians&quot;, the descendants of Black Seminoles identify as Bahamians, while acknowledging their connections to the American South.

In 1807, the British Empire had banned the international slave trade in its colonies through the Slave Trade Act. At times U.S. ships in its domestic coastwise slave trade were wrecked on Bahama islands or reefs. Even before 1834, when Britain abolished slavery in its colonies, the colonial governments in the Caribbean freed the slaves from such American ships as the &quot;Comet&quot; and &quot;Encomium&quot;, and later the &quot;Hermosa&quot;.

In addition, Bahamian mariners raided passing illegal slave ships and liberated Africans. Such freed Africans entered a system of apprenticeship or indentured servitude in The Bahamas. Later, many of these freed Africans and their offspring migrated to the Out Islands, including Andros, resulting in an indigenous culture that is closer to those in West Africa than most other black cultures in the Western Hemisphere.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries (1841–1938), Greek spongers immigrated to Andros for the rich sponge fishing on the Great Bahama Bank off Andros&#x27; west coast. For a period of years, Andros sponging was The Bahamas&#x27; largest industry. In the 1930s, the sponges were wiped out by a Red Tide infestation. The sponging industry died, and the spongers left the island for Key West, and Tarpon Springs, Florida. Thousands of unemployed Bahamians moved to the village of Coconut Grove near Miami.

From the 1950s through the 1970s, the Owens Lumber company, a US-owned company, deforested much of the indigenous pineyards that grew on North Andros. As a result of poor planning for sustainable harvests, the island today has overcrowded forests of mainly young trees.

In the 1960s and 1970s The Bahamas, led by Sir Lynden Pindling, the Member of Parliament for Kemps Bay on South Andros, negotiated independence from the British. Self-rule was granted in 1964, and one-man one-vote Majority Rule in 1967.

The Bahamas achieved Independence 10 July 1973. One of the final acts of the British Crown in The Bahamas was to grant AUTEC a long-term lease for land on Andros. (It is similar to the U.S. lease for its Guantanamo Bay Navy Base in Cuba.)

Sir Lynden became the first Prime Minister of The Bahamas. He served until 1992, when his party lost control of Parliament. He retained his seat representing South Andros.

==Geography==

Noteworthy for a unique combination of marine features and ecosystems, Andros is bordered on the east by the Tongue of the Ocean. The Andros Barrier Reef is the world&#x27;s sixth longest. It runs for , averaging a distance of from the Andros shore. The extensive flats of the Great Bahama Bank lie to the west, northwest and south of Andros. The island has the world&#x27;s largest collection of blue holes.

Geographically, North Andros is the sixth largest island in the West Indies, at roughly in area and long and wide at its widest point, and the 153rd largest island on Earth. If all three main islands are included, Andros is the fifth-largest island in the West Indies, after Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. Although comparable in total area to the state of Rhode Island (3140 km2, population 1.05 million) together with Long Island, New York (3600 km2, population 7.5 million), Andros only has a population of approximately 8000, almost all of whom are settled in a thin strip near the Queen Elizabeth Highway running along the island&#x27;s eastern coast.

Andros is west across the Tongue of the Ocean from The Bahamas&#x27; national capital of Nassau on New Providence Island. Its northern tip lies from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Geologically and geographically The Bahamas, including Andros, are not located in the Caribbean, whose northern boundary is the Windward Passage, but rather in the Atlantic Ocean. Historically, the nation was part of the British West Indies and is considered culturally to be part of the Caribbean. The Bahamian dialect of the English language is distinctively Caribbean in character, similar to those of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, also formerly part of the British West Indies.

The township of Fresh Creek is home to the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), operated by the U.S. Navy. The United Kingdom and United States conduct special operations training, and sonar and submarine research in the Tongue of the Ocean. The U.S. Coast Guard also runs rescue and drug interdiction operations from AUTEC.

Andros is known in The Bahamas by two nicknames, &quot;The Sleeping Giant&quot; and &quot;The Big Yard&quot;.

== Climate ==
Andros lies just north of the Tropic of Cancer, with moderate temperature range affected by its relative proximity to the Gulf Stream to the west. The island has a tropical climate with only two seasons, summer (May–November) and winter (December–April). Midsummer temperatures range from with a relative humidity of 60 to 100 percent. Winter temperatures range from and can drop to after dark. Andros Island is hit by a hurricane an average of every 2.5 years. The Great Florida Hurricane of 1929 is known in The Bahamas as The Great Andros Hurricane. Notable strikes in the modern era have included Hurricanes Betsy (1965), David (1979), Arlene (1987), Andrew (1992), Lili (1996), Floyd (1999), Michelle (2001), Wilma (2005) and Matthew (2016).
Matthew caused widespread flooding and devastation on the north end of the island around Morgan&#x27;s Bluff, Lowe Sound, and Nicholl&#x27;s Town. Many locals claim Matthew was the worst hurricane seen on Andros in nearly 90 years.

==Economy==
The largest employers on Andros Island are the Bahamian government and the AUTEC base at Fresh Creek.

Despite its small population, Andros Island has several ongoing commercial ventures. Western Air maintains its headquarters in a modern facility at the San Andros airport. A Mennonite mission-run commercial farm was founded near Blanket Sound in 1983, which grows everything from habanero peppers to sorghum and potatoes, and has numerous fruit orchards and honey bee hives. The Mennonites also run the largest car repair and carpentry shops on the island. Androsia, a hand-crafted batik factory founded at Fresh Creek in 1972, produces a vibrant, colourful fabric that has become part of the national dress and identity of The Bahamas. GreenLife Growers, a Bahamian native tree nursery at Young Sound, provides landscaping material to real estate developers and government projects throughout The Bahamas.

Commercial fishing remains a mainstay of the island&#x27;s economy: conch, lobster, snapper and grouper are all commercially harvested for sale locally and in Nassau&#x27;s fish markets. Seasonal crabbing — catching crabs and fattening them in pens for sale in Nassau — provides a cash crop for locals to supplement their income.

Local handicrafts in the Black Seminole style — particularly wood carvings and woven baskets — are a cottage industry in the settlement of Red Bays. A sample of Red Bays baskets is held by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.

A fledgling conservation industry on Andros is dedicated to preserving the island&#x27;s unique ecosystems, working in partnership with the Bahamian government (Bahamas National Trust) and such varied non-governmental organizations as The Nature Conservancy and Project AWARE of the Professional Association of Dive Instructors (PADI). They supported legislation to found the Central Andros National Park in 2002. Most of the island&#x27;s conservation efforts funnel through the non-profit nongovernmental organization, Andros Conservancy &amp; Trust Bahamas. ANCAT&#x27;s efforts are closely tied to encouraging eco-tourism, to generate economic incentives to preserve the existing varied habitats of the island. GreenForce Global Volunteering/Bahamas, an international NGO based in the UK, conducts environmental research from its operation at Stafford Creek on North Andros. It also offers 3- to 12-week dive training, and marine and environmental science programs for conservationists and others.

It also is where The Bahamas Agriculture and Marine Science Institute (BAMSI) is located.
=== Tourism ===

Tourism is Andros Island&#x27;s largest industry, and the largest private employer. The Bahamian tourism industry markets Andros as the least-explored island in the chain. From Nicholls Town in the north to Little Creek in the south are 35–40 hotels, motels, resorts, guest houses and lodges (the number varies), with a total of approximately 400 rooms. Tourists are composed primarily of scuba divers, attracted to the barrier reef, Tongue of the Ocean, and the Blue Holes; bonefishing anglers, and others looking for relaxation.

Andros Island was the site of two of the first dive-dedicated resorts in the world, and the first in The Bahamas, both founded by Canadians. Small Hope Bay Lodge near Fresh Creek was founded by Dick Birch in 1960. It continues to operate as a dive resort under the ownership and management of Dick Birch&#x27;s children.

The second resort was the Andros Reef Inn located in Blanket Sound founded by Archie Forfar in the 1960s. After his death in a diving accident in 1971, his property was purchased by International Field Studies, Inc (IFS) International Field Studies, Inc. of Columbus, OH in 1977. Renamed Forfar Field Station, the site is used for science education and research of the surrounding reef, marine, and island ecology for Bahamian and American middle and high school students, as well, as college students, non-profit organizations, and researchers. 

Andros Island is surrounded by thousands of square kilometres of fishable flats, home to permit, tarpon, and especially bonefish. The island is known as the bonefish capital of the world. Bonefish are considered among the world&#x27;s premier gamefish for anglers. Other varieties of fishing are available on Andros. Deep sea fishing beyond the reef in the Tongue of the Ocean offers dorado, tuna, sailfish, wahoo, and jacks. Locals fish regularly on the reef for abundant snapper and grouper.

==Festivals==
Andros sponsors a number of festivals: Crabfest at Fresh Creek each June, the annual regatta at Morgan&#x27;s Bluff, Conch Festival, a local Junkanoo and Goombay festival between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s, the Pirates&#x27; Festival, and the Annual Seafood Splash &amp; Chickcharnie Festival. In addition, ANCAT sponsors numerous ecologically oriented events for tourists and locals.

== Flora and fauna ==

Andros exhibits greater botanical diversity than any other island in The Bahamas. The presence of its barrier reef and the Tongue of the Ocean give the island a great zoological diversity. Among the various land ecosystems are hardwood coppice, pineyard, scrub, saltwater marsh, rocky and sandy beaches, palm savannas and mangroves. Non-coastal areas on Andros are referred to generically as &#x27;the bush&#x27;. Coastal mangrove flats and estuaries are referred to as &#x27;the swash&#x27;, or salt water marsh.
In the 1960s and 1970s the Owens Lumber company, a US-owned company that bought out a number of Bahamian lumber interests, clear cut and deforested much of the indigenous pineyards that grew on North Andros. Timber was not harvested on western Andros because these forests are surrounded by wetlands and could not be economically harvested. It is currently home to some of the largest pines remaining in The Bahamas. What is found on the North Andros landmass today are over-crowded forests of mainly young trees.

Andros has The Bahamas&#x27; only freshwater river, contributing to its biodiversity. Thousands of kilometres of underground water from rainwater collect in aquifers below the island&#x27;s surface. Nineteen million litres of freshwater are shipped daily to Nassau by barge through the pumping station located in Morgan&#x27;s Bluff.

=== Andros Island iguana ===
Andros Island is home to several species of lizards, including the Andros Island iguana (&quot;Cyclura cychlura cychlura&quot;), a large endangered subspecies of the Northern Bahamian rock iguana. The Andros Island iguana is listed as an Endangered species and can be found on the IUCN Red List, with a wild population of 3,500 individuals remaining on the island.

=== Marine life ===
The barrier reef and the Tongue of the Ocean, together with mangrove swamps, rocky tidal pools, and estuaries, provide breeding and growing habitats for a wide variety of young marine life.
Andros has a variety of close-to-shore and on-shore ecosystems that may be unique on Earth: tidal inland and ocean blue holes, shallow sand and mud flats, tidal estuaries, mangrove swamps, the pelagic ecozone of the drop-off only from shore, the world&#x27;s third-largest barrier reef, and huge freshwater aquifers. The marine biosphere is fed by both the teeming life of the mangrove marshes and estuaries on the mainland, and the upwelling of cool water from the Tongue of the Ocean, resulting in an unparallelled variety of sea life.

Humpback whales, which are found in all the world&#x27;s oceans, follow a regular migration route, summering in temperate and polar waters for feeding, and wintering in tropical waters for mating and calving. Humpbacks used to be common in the Tongue of the Ocean off Andros, and are still seen infrequently. Pilot whales are also seen off the coast of Andros.

Inside the Andros Barrier Reef, staghorn, elkhorn and other corals are found in shallows deep. Beyond the shallow reefs are tiny cays and islets, from which the sea bottom gradually deepens until at a depth of between comes &quot;The Wall&quot;, with its plunge into the abyss of the Tongue of the Ocean.
Four species of turtles are found in Andros&#x27; waters: loggerhead, green, hawksbill and, rarely, the leatherback.

=== Birds ===
Most resident bird species of The Bahamas are believed to have come northward from the West Indies, as winds and sea currents favour migration from the south and southeast. Some 225 species are known in the islands. Andros, with its vast undeveloped land, is home to many of them. 
The Bahama oriole is unique to Andros Island. Critically endangered, it has an estimated remaining population of as few as several hundred. The great lizard cuckoo is found only on Andros, New Providence, and Eleuthera. The rare Kirtland&#x27;s warbler — an estimated 600 remain — was first seen on the island in 1879 and some individuals winter on Andros. The endangered migratory Atlantic subspecies of the piping plover favours the rocky shores and sandy beaches of Andros. Other rare and uncommon birds found in the Andros environ include the Bahama yellowthroat, Bahama woodstar, Bahama swallow, West Indian whistling duck and Key West quail dove.

Other birds found on Andros include the loggerhead kingbird, La Sagra&#x27;s flycatcher, Cuban pewee, Bahama mockingbird, red-legged thrush, thick-billed vireo, black-whiskered vireo, olive-capped warbler, Greater Antillean bullfinch, black-faced grassquit, melodious grassquit, least grebe, olivaceous cormorant, American flamingo, Bahama pintail, osprey, American kestrel, sooty tern, roseate tern, noddy tern, white-crowned pigeon, zenaida dove, Caribbean dove, smooth-billed ani and Cuban emerald hummingbird.

=== Orchids ===
More than 50 species of wild orchids thrive in the more than of subtropical forests and the swamps of Andros. Many are endemic, including three native species of the climbing orchid &quot;Vanilla&quot;. Commercial flower collectors have been known to set fire to the pineland coppices to collect the sharp-petalled bletias (&quot;Bletia purpurea&quot;) that flourish in ashy soil. The orchid genus &quot;Epidendrum&quot; has nine species endemic to The Bahamas, all of which can be found on Andros.

=== Legendary creatures ===
According to local lore, two mythical creatures are endemic to Andros: the Lusca and the Chickcharney (also spelled &quot;Chickcharnie&quot;.) The Lusca, a gigantic half-octopus, half-shark, supposedly swallows whole boats. The Chickcharney, furry and feathered and tall, has one red eye and three-toed claws.

A man from Oregon believes that the legend of the Chickcharney is based on the prehistoric barn owl &quot;Tyto pollens&quot;, although remains have never been found on Andros and the youngest fossil bones are from a layer before the arrival of the first humans, the Lucayans.

== Blue holes ==

The island&#x27;s blue holes are water-filled cave systems, which attract divers from all over the world. 
All the main islands of The Bahamas have blue holes, but those of Andros are the best known. Andros has 178 on land with at least 50 in the sea. Blue holes can best be described as entrances to the intricate cave systems that run underneath the island and sea floor.

Their openings can be found among the shallow creeks, inland lakes, and the shallow banks of The Bahamas. The caves, which have developed within the Bahamian carbonate platforms, can be laterally and vertically very extensive. Lateral cave passages can extend to several kilometres and vertically may range in depth from ten to several hundred metres.Noted oceanographer and environmentalist Jacques Cousteau visited Andros Island in 1970 to explore and film the Andros Blue Holes. The video of this expedition, called &quot;The Secret of the Sunken Caves,&quot; is included in the 2005 Cousteau video collection, &quot;The Jacques Cousteau Odyssey: The Complete Collection.&quot; Cousteau explored several ocean blue holes, and the inland blue holes known as Uncle Charlie&#x27;s, Church&#x27;s, and the Guardian.

&quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine has featured the Andros Blue Holes several times over the past thirty years, most recently in August 2010.

== Transportation ==
Andros Island has four airports with paved runways: San Andros Airport at Nicholls Town, Andros Town International Airport located at Fresh Creek, the Clarence A. Bain Airport at Mangrove Cay and Congo Town Airport in South Andros. Andros Town International is an international port of entry for private pilots. The island is served by multiple daily flights from Nassau by [(Jet 1)], BahamasAir, Watermakers Air Western Air, and LeAir — the flight to any of the four airports is 15–25 minutes. Daily scheduled flights to Nassau from London, Paris, New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Houston, Dallas, Jacksonville, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Orlando and other major cities provide easy connection from Andros to the rest of the world.

Regularly scheduled charters provide direct service to Andros Town from Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Andros is connected to Nassau by Sea-Link ferry, which runs daily to Morgan&#x27;s Bluff on the north end of the island and Fresh Creek in central Andros. It is also reachable by mailboat from Nassau and for inter-island travel with stops at numerous Andros settlements. 
 There is no public transport on Andros Island, but a private shuttle bus service on North Andros connects Nicholls Town with Behring Point. Taxi service is available at all four airports.

== Political organisation ==
Andros is politically divided into four Districts (North Andros, Central Andros, South Andros and Mangrove Cay) and ten townships. (Mastic Point, Lowe Sound, Nicholls Town, Staniard Creek, Fresh Creek, Cargill Creek, The Bluff, Long Bay Cays, Kemps Bay, Deep Creek). It is represented in the national parliament by two seats — North Andros and South Andros. Dozens of tiny settlements have developed along the island&#x27;s east coast, (i.e. Blanket Sound, Love Hill, Davis Creek, Small Hope Bay, Calabash Bay, Bowen Sound, Behring Point, Little Creek). There is one settlement on the west coast, Red Bays, historically settled by American fugitive slaves and Black Seminoles, located at the island&#x27;s northwestern tip.

== Religion ==
There are a number of church denominations represented within Andros. In North Andros, the Anglican Church has a presence through St Margaret&#x27;s Parish. This parish consists of two churches, St Margaret&#x27;s located in the settlement of Nicholls Town and St Mary Magdalene located in the settlement of Mastic Point. There are also Methodist churches in Stafford Creek, Nicholl&#x27;s Town and Mastic Point.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nassau provides clergy for parishes throughout Andros. On South Andros Sacred Heart parish is in Little Creek and St. Robert Bellarmine parish is in High Rock. Mangrove Cay is served by St. Benedict&#x27;s parish and Central Andros is served by St. John Chrysostom parish in Fresh Creek and Christ the King parish in Cargill Creek. Catholic services are also provided on Saturday evening at the AUTEC Navy Base chapel.

Blanket Sound Mennonite Church is located in Blanket Sound on Andros. The congregation is affiliated with the Eastern Pennsylvania Mennonite Church.

==Legacy==
*The U.S. National Park Service is working with The Bahamas, particularly the African Bahamanian Museum and Research Center (ABAC) in Nassau, to develop interpretive programs at Red Bays, Andros as an international site connected to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Trail, which American slaves used to escape to freedom.

<doc id="612580" wikidata="Q5631372" url="?curid=612580" title="HMS Apollo (F70)">
<text>HMS &quot;Apollo&quot; was a batch 3B broadbeam of the Royal Navy. She was, like the rest of the class, named after a figure of mythology. &quot;Apollo&quot; was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders of Scotstoun. She was launched on 15 October 1970 and commissioned on 28 May 1972, making her the penultimate &quot;Leander&quot;.

Both &quot;Apollo&quot; and &quot;Ariadne&quot; are easily distinguished from the other &quot;Leander&quot;s by their &#x27;witches hat&#x27; – fitted to the top of the foremast as a part of the electronic warfare array.

==Construction==
&quot;Apollo&quot; was one of two &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates ordered on 29 July 1968 for the Royal Navy under the 1967–68 construction programme, the other being and were the last two &quot;Leander&quot;s built for the Royal Navy. She was laid down at Yarrow Shipbuilders&#x27; Scotstoun, Glasgow shipyard on 1 May 1969 as Yard number 1002. She was launched on 15 October 1970 and commissioned on 10 June 1972 with the Pennant number &quot;F70&quot;.

&quot;Apollo&quot; was a Batch 3, &quot;Broad-Beamed&quot; &quot;Leander&quot;, and as such was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. A single Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launcher was fitted aft (on the Helicopter hangar roof), while two Oerlikon 20mm cannon provided close-in defence. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

&quot;Apollo&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 978 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 184 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar.
==Royal Navy service==

&quot;Apollo&quot; saw her first action during the Second Cod War in 1973, during the fishing disputes with Iceland, when &quot;Apollo&quot;, while on a fishery protection patrol, was in collision with the Icelandic gunboat on 29 August 1973. One Icelandic engineer died later while welding a plate on &quot;Ægir&quot;″s damaged hull, the only recorded fatality of the Cod Wars.

In January 1977 the UK extended its territorial waters from 12 miles to 200 miles to create an exclusive economic zone for fishery rights. &quot;Apollo&quot; took turns with other frigates to police the North Sea pending the introduction into service of the fishery protection vessels.

In 1977, &quot;Apollo&quot; took part in the last Fleet Review of the Royal Navy so far, in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. As captain of the Second Frigate Squadron, &quot;Apollo&quot; was responsible for anchorages of all warships at the Royal Fleet Review. In recognition of this work, the admiralty awarded the ship four rather than two 1977 QEII Silver Jubilee Medals. &quot;Apollo&quot; was positioned between and .

&quot;Apollo&quot; was intended to be modernised, (probably involving removal of her one 4.5-inch twin gun, which would have been replaced by the Exocet anti-ship missile and Sea Wolf anti-aircraft missiles, but possibly also involving fitting of a towed array sonar), but the modernisation was cancelled due to the 1981 Defence Review by the minister, John Nott. In June 1982, &quot;Apollo&quot; was sent to patrol the South Atlantic in the aftermath of the Falklands War, encountering heavy seas that damaged her hull. She returned home in October. In late 1983 &quot;Apollo&quot; once again returned to the South Atlantic.

&quot;Apollo&quot; was refitted at Devonport between 30 July 1984 and 17 May 1985 at a cost of £11,000,000, recommissioning on 28 June that year. The ship&#x27;s armament was unchanged, but Type 1006 navigation radar was fitted and the ship&#x27;s davits and motor boat replaced by a light pole-derrick to handle lighter inflatable boats.

==Sale to Pakistan==

In 1988, &quot;Apollo&quot;″s Royal Navy career came to an end when she was decommissioned on 7 July and sold to Pakistan on 15 July. The ship was renamed PNS &quot;Zulfiqar&quot;, and commissioning in the Pakistan Navy on 14 October 1988. From 1991 to 1993 she underwent a major refit and her 20 mm guns and Seacat system were replaced by twin 25 mm mounts, and her Westland Wasp was replaced by an SA 319B Alouette III helicopter. &quot;Zulfiqar&quot; continued in service for 18 years with the Pakistan Navy until 29 October 2006 when she was decommissioned into training.

==Fate==
On 12 March 2010, &quot;Zulfiqar&quot; was sunk as a target in the Arabian Sea. Torpedoes and missiles were fired from an F-22P frigate, P3C aircraft and an Agosta 90B submarine.
