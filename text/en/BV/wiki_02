<text>Lesothosaurus is a monospecific genus of ornithischian dinosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic in what is now South Africa and Lesotho. It was named by paleontologist Peter Galton in 1978, the name meaning &quot;lizard from Lesotho&quot;. The genus has only one valid species, Lesothosaurus diagnosticus. &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; is one of the most completely-known early ornithischians, based on numerous skull and postcranial fossils from the Upper Elliot Formation. It had a simpler tooth and jaw anatomy than later ornithischians, and may have been omnivorous in some parts of the year.

== Discovery and naming ==

Fossils referrable to &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; may have been known from as early as 1959, when a right dentary (lower jawbone) fragment bearing three teeth was collected by French geologist Jean Fabre from the Red Beds of the Upper Elliot Formation near Mapheteng in Lesotho, Southern Africa, dating to the Early Jurassic (199(?)-190 million years ago). The dentary was described as the holotype of a new genus and species, &quot;Fabrosaurus australis&quot;, by paleontologist Leonard Ginsburg in 1964. Ginsburg placed it in the family Scelidosauridae and diagnosed it based on its unusual tooth morphology when compared to the only other contemporary ornithischian &quot;Heterodontosaurus&quot;. Due to its fragmentary nature, &quot;Fabrosaurus&quot; is now seen as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, though the holotype is likely from an individual of &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot;. The holotype was all that was known until expeditions by the London University College to the same site in Lesotho from 1963 to 1964 recovered scores of fossils from &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot;, including a partial skeleton including a skull and another isolated partial skull (NHMUK PV RU B17 &amp; NHMUK PV RU B23). These specimens were described in the 1970s as belonging to &quot;Fabrosaurus&quot; by geologist Richard A. Thulborn. A joint expedition between the NHMUK, London University College, Yale University, and the South African Museum collected many additional specimens of &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; from the same site in 1967–68. This included very well preserved cranial material, some of the best known, that was described in the 1991.

British paleontologist Peter Galton named &quot;Lesothosaurus diagnosticus&quot; in 1978, with NHMUK PV RU B17 and NHMUK PV RU B23 as the syntypes (the series of fossils that diagnose a species). The generic name &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; is derived from the Kingdom of Lesotho, where the fossils were discovered, and the Latin root sauros meaning “lizard”, a root commonly used in dinosaur names. The specific name &quot;diagnosticus&quot; is derived from the Greek root &quot;diagnostikos&quot; meaning “distinguished” in reference to &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; being a distinct member of Fabrosauridae. In the material referred to &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot;, Galton stated that some of it was instead from a “large fabrosaurid”. This “large fabrosaurid” was finally named in 2005, dubbed &quot;Stormbergia dangershoeki&quot;, on the basis of the partial postcranial skeleton SAM-PK-K1105. This species almost certainly represents the adult form of &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot;. &quot;Stormbergia&quot; was named for the Stormberg Series of rocks in southern Africa, which includes the Elliot Formation, and the location (Dangerhoek Farm) in South Africa at which the type specimen was found. The type specimen consists of a partial postcranial skeleton, with two additional referred specimens assigned to the species. Fossils from Elliot Formation sites in South Africa outside of Lesotho in Jamestown were described in the 2000s, including a nearly complete skeleton of an adult preserved in articulation. A study published in 2017 by Baron, Norman &amp; Barrett demonstrated that the differences between &quot;Stormbergia&quot; and &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; are most likely related to the animal&#x27;s growth. The authors argued that &quot;Stormbergia&quot; is a junior subjective synonym of &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; and should be regarded as invalid. Several other skull and postcranial specimens have been discovered since, including the description of two partial skulls in 2002, which preserved signs of individual variation. Redescription of the syntypes came in 2015 and 2017, including the integration of CT technology.

== Description ==

Due to the great quantity and quality of specimens known from &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot;, information about its anatomy is known in detail. &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; was a lightly built, bipedal animal that varied between 1 (3.3 ft) to 2 meters (6.6 ft) long. It was one of the earliest ornithischians. Its long slender legs, small arms with hands that would not have been able to grasp properly, and slender tail all suggest that it was a fast runner. Like all ornithischians, the tips of &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; upper and lower jaws were horny, forming a beaklike structure. Behind the beak were leaf-shaped teeth that lined the jaws. The teeth of the premaxillae (six per side) are more slender and curved than the maxillary teeth. Analysis of its teeth has shown that &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; sliced up its food with its beak and was not able to chew its food. Studies of the tooth wear have shown much less abrasion on the teeth than would be expected of a plant-eater feeding mainly on tough, arid-climate plants, and concluded that &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; was probably an opportunistic omnivore, feeding primarily on small animals during seasons when softer plants were not available.

The small skull of &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; was narrow and pointed, with large eye sockets. It had large cavities for the eye and jaw muscles. The tip of the snout likely ended in a small beak, based on a blade-like predentary bone (at the tip of the lower jaw) and a roughly-texture front end of the cranium. Its teeth were pointed with grooved edges. The skull was mounted on a short but flexible neck.

A bonebed of &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; described in 2016 includes material from three large individuals. This association suggest that this early ornithischian dinosaur may have lived in groups.

=== Skull and dentition ===

The skull and teeth of &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; are more generalized than the heavily specialized and unusual anatomies of the contemporary scelidosaurid and heterodontosaurid ornithischians, which exhibit traits like osteoderms and extreme heterodonty. The best preserved skull is NHMUK PV RU B23, though it is missing some elements. The skull was unlike the triangular skull of &quot;Heterodontosaurus&quot; in that the caudal half was boxy while the anterior half was tapered and elongated. The height apex of the cranium is just behind the orbit (eye socket) in lateral view and the skull roof (frontals, parietals) are gently rounded in lateral view. The snout is smoothly tapered to the premaxilla (snout tip bone). The skull lacks a break in slope along the snout anterior to the orbit, as in the contemporary &quot;Heterodontosaurus&quot;. The orbits are round and large relative to the skull size (making up 36% of the basal skull length i. e. from the premaxilla tip to the posterior margin of the basioccipital). The skulls bears a relatively small, sub-triangular antorbital fenestra (a large gap of bone) with an apex pointing dorsally and a length that is circa 13% of basal skull length. The supratemporal fenestrae are anteroposteriorly longer than mediolaterally wide, with a sub-ovary to sub-triangular outline in dorsal view. In contrast, the infratemporal fenestrae are sub-rectangular in lateral view and extend for most of the skull&#x27;s height. The infratemporal fenestra is oblong with an oblique axis, while the supratemporal fenestra is oval in outline. The anterior naris (nostril) had several small, sub-ovate openings along its length. The craniomandibular joint (where the skull contacts the jaw bone) is depressed relative to the margin of the maxillary alveoli. There are 15-16 tooth positions in the maxilla, in contrary to the 11 preserved in &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot;’ (a Late Triassic dinosauriform that may be an ornithischian). There are 20 tooth positions in the dentary of &quot;Lesothosaurus,&quot; but only 15 are preserved in &quot;Pisanosaurus.&quot; The alveolar foramina are on the medial wall of the maxilla and dentary, one per tooth position, and represent the area where the neurovascular supply accesses the dental lamina. This condition is similar to that in the extant Lepidosaurs, which have lizard lips, leading some paleontologists to suggest that &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; had cheeks and lips covering its teeth. The cranium is widest across the postorbitals in dorsal view. It tapers anteriorly to the premaxillae, which creates a short, strongly pointed muzzle. The skull is widest at the midshafts of the quadrates in occipital view.

The mandible (lower jaw) of &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; has a nearly straight ventral margin and bears only a slight upturn at its anterior tip. The mandible is made up mostly of the dentary, which is 50% of its length in lateral view. Characteristically of Ornithischians, there is a small beak-like bone at the tip of the dentary known as the predentary. The predentary is shaped like an arrowhead in ventral view, with one elongated central keel with smaller lateral processes jutting off the sides. The oral margin is smooth and straight in lateral view, with an uncurved anterior tip. Two foramina are preserved on and near the lateral processes, suggesting that this element was well-supplied with blood and nerves. There is a well-developed coronoid eminence, but it does not expand dorsally into the tall, distinct processes (projection of bone) like in advanced Ornithischians like &quot;Triceratops&quot; and &quot;Zalmoxes.&quot; The jaw joint is slightly depressed relative to the alveolar bar that takes up most of the mandible. The mandible preserves an anteroposteriorly elongated fenestra between the dentary, angular, and surrangular, similar to the ones in the skull, that would make the mandible lighter. The mandible differentiates from those of other Ornithischians greatly in that an inturned, ‘spout-like’ mandibular symphysis is preserved.

&quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; has two types of teeth preserved: long, curved, sharp premaxillary teeth at the front of the mouth; wide, short, robust maxillary and dentary teeth. There are 6 premaxillary teeth on the left and right sides of the premaxilla which are preceded by a small edentulous (tooth-lacking) section that shows signs of preserving a large rhampthotheca (beak) made of keratin. A neck and slight swelling divides the base of the tooth crown from the long, subcylindrical roots. The lingual surface of the more medial premaxillary teeth have a vertical furrow and an adjacent sharp ride that extends towards the crown&#x27;s mesial edge. The last two teeth crowns in the series acquire distal and medial denticles. The posterior process of the premaxilla lacks alvelovi, creating a small diastema (gap) in between the premaxillary and maxillary tooth rows. The maxillary and dentary teeth are low, triangular, and “leaf-shaped” with a distinct neck and cingulum. The denticles are coarse on the medial and distal tooth borders, with sporadically developed high-angled marginal tooth wearing. This suggests rapid tooth replacement in these teeth.

=== Postcrania ===
Although many specimens are known, some elements of &quot;Lesothosaurus’&quot; postcranial anatomy are poorly known, especially in the axial skeleton which is incomplete in all specimens. The cervical (neck) vertebrae were only 9 in number, but no full cervical series are known. The cervical series of the syntype NHMUK PV R11004 preserves the 2nd cervical, known as the axis, in articulation with the 3rd cervical vertebra. The centrum of the axis is spool-shaped without a ventral keel. The neural arch is very large and well-developed, greatly extending posterodorsally past the postzygapophyses. The 3rd cervical is also amphicoelus but has a trapezoidal centrum shape. The neural arch is expanded dorsoventrally, but has a small neural spine. As for the dorsal (back) vertebrae, &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; has no complete dorsal columns preserved but likely had 12-15 dorsal (back) vertebrae. The dorsals also had spool-shaped centra, ventral keels (though they are lost in more caudal centra), and neural spines that are short and rectangular. The neural spines of the anterior dorsals are also larger than those of the posterior ones. Ossified tendons are preserved attached to the neural spines of anterior dorsals, suggesting they were arranged longitudinally as in &quot;Heterodontosaurus, Scelidosaurus,&quot; &amp; &quot;Hypsilophodon.&quot; This feature probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. The sacral vertebrae series had 5 vertebrae with sacral ribs and a sacrodorsal with a short sacral rib. The sacrals notably had large transverse processes that were muscle attachments to the sacral ribs. The number of caudal (tail) vertebrae is unknown, but the proximal caudals are well preserved. The centra of these caudals became more cylindrical as they became located distally, in contrast to the spool-shaped dorsal centra. The chevrons are Y-shaped in anterior and posterior view and attached to the ventral side of the caudal centra, with larger attachment points on the proximal caudals.

The scapula (shoulder blade) is not fused to the coracoid and is longer than the humerus (upper arm bone). The dorsal surface develops a large, bar-like acromion process that extends further dorsally than in many other ornithischians. The distal end of the scapula is greatly expanded and has a convex margin. The coracoid is disc-shaped and subcircular in lateral and medial views. No sternal ribs are preserved in &quot;Lesothosaurus,&quot; but based on related taxa, the sternal plates were connected to the rib cage by elements known as sternal ribs. The pelvis was long and expanded dorsally on the ilium, with a long pubis that had a stub-like prepubis connected to it. The ischium had a large proximal end with a curved, thin shaft.

The forelimbs were small relative to the rest of the body. The humerus was elongate and straight in anterior and lateral views, with expanded proximal and distal ends linked by a long, slender shaft. The proximal end had a large deltopectoral crest which was asymmetrical and C-shaped in dorsal view. The humeral shaft has a rounded, transverse cross-section. The humerus length was only 63.3% as long as the femur length, which is much shorter than other basal ornithischians. The radius is mostly straight except for transversely expanded proximal and distal ends, the proximal end having two small, rounded condyles. The ulna is also straight, but is slightly longer with an ovoid cross-section. There is only a single, incomplete manus known from &quot;Lesothosaurus.&quot; The manus has 5 metacarpals and 5 phalanxes, though only the second phalanx is fully preserved. The unguals are small and triangular in dorsal view.

The hindlimbs were long and slender, similar to those of most other small basal ornithischians. The femur (thigh bone) was long and bowed anteriorly, with a large 4th trochanter for muscle attachments. The femoral head at the proximal end was large, while the distal end terminated with two condyles where the tibia would interlock. The largest known femur is from NMQR 3076, which measures in length. The tibia (shin bone) has a very similar morphology, but it is 25% longer than the femur and more slender. The fibula has an expansion at the proximal end and a thin shaft that is sub-oval in cross-section. The astragalus and calcaneum are small, though the latter is the smaller of the two, and only preserved in one specimen. The metatarsals are thin, long, and tightly fit together. The metatarsals have great expansions at the distal ends where the pedal phalanges would articulate with the rest of the leg. Metatarsal III is the longest of them all and has the greatest transverse width distally and at the mid-shaft. The metatarsal I is truncated and less than half the length of metatarsal II. Notably, &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; lacks a metatarsal V, a distinct trait of the taxon. The pedal digits (toes) are long, with pedal phalanges (toe bones) that are spool-shaped, with large proximal and distal ends but thin shafts. Digit I was a hallux, with one small phalange ending in a large ungual (claw). Digit II had two large, thick phalanges ending in a large, wide ungual. Digit III was the longest digit by length and had a combined length of . It was composed of 3 pedal phalanges and an ungual. Digit IV had the most pedal phalanges, with 4 preserved and a small ungual. The ungual bones of the toes were claw-like, and not hoof-like as in more advanced ornithischians.
== Classification ==

Peter Galton considered &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; to be a basal ornithopod in the family Fabrosauridae, which included several other ornithischians such as &quot;Nanosaurus&quot; (from the Late Jurassic of North America), &quot;Echinodon&quot; (from the Lower Cretaceous of England), and &quot;Fabrosaurus&quot; (which Galton considered distinct from &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; but only included the holotype). However, a 1991 redescription by Paul Sereno suggested that &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; and many other &quot;fabrosaurids&quot; were actually basal members of Ornithischia, one of the two main orders of Dinosauria (the other being Saurischia). This opinion has been supported by later cladistic studies of basal Ornithischia, which have also found it as the basalmost member of Neornithischia (a group that includes pachycephalosaurs, ceratopsians, and ornithopods) and related to &quot;Agilisaurus, Hexinulsaurus,&quot; and &quot;Nanosaurus.&quot; Alternatively, this dinosaur may be a very early thyreophoran, a member of the group including the armored stegosaurians and ankylosaurians.

The Butler &quot;et al&quot;., 2005 analysis placed &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; at the base of Neornithischia:

Basal neornithischians like &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; are known from several time periods and regions, with &quot;Nanosaurus&quot; fossils coming from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation (155-148 mya) of the western United States, &quot;Hexinlusaurus&quot; from the Shaximiao Formation, dating to the Middle Jurassic (170-168 mya), in southern China, and &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; from the Early Cretaceous (130-125 mya) of England. However, the phylogenetic status of basal neornithischians is constantly in a flux and some analyses have recovered these taxa as basal ornithopods or in other groups.

== Paleoenvironment ==
&quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; is known from fossils found in formations of the Karoo Supergroup, including the Upper Elliot Formation and the Clarens Formation, which date to the Hettangian and Sinemurian ages of the Lower Jurassic, around 200–190 million years ago. Originally, &quot;Lesothosaurus&quot; was thought to be from the Upper Triassic period. The Upper Elliot Formation consists of red/purple mudstone and red/white sandstone, whereas the slightly younger Clarens Formation consists of white/cream-coloured sandstone. The Clarens Formation is less rich in fossils than the Upper Elliot Formation; its sediments also often form cliffs, restricting accessibility for fossil hunters. The Upper Elliot Formation is characterised by animals that appear to be more lightly built than those of the Lower Elliot Formation, which may have been an adaptation to the drier climate at this time in southern Africa. Both formations are famous for their abundant vertebrate fossils, including temnospondyl amphibians, turtles, lepidosaurs, aetosaurs, crocodylomorphs, and non-mammal cynodonts.

Other dinosaurs from these formations include the heterodontosaurid &quot;Heterodontosaurus&quot;, the basal sauropodomorph &quot;Massospondylus&quot;, and the theropod &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot;. The Upper Elliot Formation shows the largest known heterodontosaurid diversity of any rock unit; besides &quot;Heterodontosaurus&quot;, it contained &quot;Lycorhinus&quot;, &quot;Abrictosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Pegomastax&quot;. Yet another member of the family, &quot;Geranosaurus&quot;, is known from the Clarens Formation. The high heterodontosaurid diversity have led researchers to conclude that different species might have fed on separate food sources in order to avoid competition (niche partitioning).

<text>Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard is a 1904 novel by Joseph Conrad, set in the fictitious South American republic of &quot;Costaguana&quot;. It was originally published serially in monthly instalments of &quot;T.P.&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Nostromo&quot; 47th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It is frequently regarded as amongst the best of Conrad&#x27;s long fiction; F. Scott Fitzgerald once said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather have written &quot;Nostromo&quot; than any other novel.&quot;

==Background==
Conrad set his novel in the town of Sulaco, a port in the western region of the imaginary country Costaguana.

In his &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot; to later editions of &quot;Nostromo&quot;, Joseph Conrad provides a detailed explanation of the inspirational origins of his novel. There he relates how, as a young man of about seventeen, while serving aboard a ship in the Gulf of Mexico, he heard the story of a man who had stolen, single-handedly, &quot;a whole lighter-full of silver&quot;. As Conrad goes on to relate, he forgot about the story until some twenty-five years later when he came across a travelogue in a used-book shop in which the author related how he worked for years aboard a schooner whose master claimed to be that very thief who had stolen the silver.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Nostromo&quot; is set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana, and more specifically in that country&#x27;s Occidental Province and its port city of Sulaco. Though Costaguana is a fictional nation, its geography as described in the book resembles real-life Colombia. Costaguana has a long history of tyranny, revolution and warfare, but has recently experienced a period of stability under the dictator Ribiera.

Charles Gould is a native Costaguanero of English descent who owns an important silver-mining concession near the key port of Sulaco. He is tired of the political instability in Costaguana and its concomitant corruption, and uses his wealth to support Ribiera&#x27;s government, which he believes will finally bring stability to the country after years of misrule and tyranny by self-serving dictators. Instead, Gould&#x27;s refurbished silver mine and the wealth it has generated inspires a new round of revolutions and self-proclaimed warlords, plunging Costaguana into chaos. Among others, the forces of the revolutionary General Montero invade Sulaco after securing the inland capital. Gould, adamant that his silver mine should not become spoil for his enemies, orders Nostromo, the trusted &quot;Capataz de Cargadores&quot; (Head Longshoreman) of Sulaco, to take the mine&#x27;s most recent load of silver offshore, and arranges for the mine complex to be destroyed by dynamite if the coup leaders try to take it. 

Nostromo is an Italian expatriate who has risen to his position through his bravery and daring exploits. (&quot;Nostromo&quot; is Italian for &quot;shipmate&quot; or &quot;boatswain&quot;, but the name could also be considered a corruption of the Italian phrase &quot;nostro uomo&quot; or &quot;nostr&#x27;uomo&quot;, meaning &quot;our man&quot;). Nostromo&#x27;s real name is Giovanni Battista Fidanza —&quot;Fidanza&quot; meaning &quot;trust&quot; in archaic Italian.

Nostromo is a commanding figure in Sulaco, respected by the wealthy Europeans and seemingly limitless in his abilities to command power among the local population. He is, however, never admitted to become a part of upper-class society, but is instead viewed by the rich as their useful tool. He is believed by Charles Gould and his own employers to be incorruptible, and it is for this reason that Nostromo is entrusted with removing the silver from Sulaco to keep it from the revolutionaries. Accompanied by the young journalist Martin Decoud, Nostromo sets off to smuggle the silver out of Sulaco. However, the lighter on which the silver is being transported is struck at night in the waters off Sulaco by a transport carrying the invading revolutionary forces under the command of Colonel Sotillo. Nostromo and Decoud manage to save the silver by putting the lighter ashore on Great Isabel. Decoud and the silver are deposited on the deserted island of Great Isabel in the expansive bay off Sulaco, while Nostromo scuttles the lighter and manages to swim back to shore undetected. Back in Sulaco, Nostromo&#x27;s power and fame continues to grow as he daringly rides over the mountains to summon the army which ultimately saves Sulaco&#x27;s powerful leaders from the revolutionaries and ushers in the independent state of Sulaco. In the meantime, left alone on the deserted island, Decoud eventually loses his mind. He takes the small lifeboat out to sea and there shoots himself, after first weighing his body down with some of the silver ingots so that he would sink into the sea.

His exploits during the revolution do not bring Nostromo the fame he had hoped for, and he feels slighted and used. Feeling that he has risked his life for nothing, he is consumed by resentment, which leads to his corruption and ultimate destruction, for he has kept secret the true fate of the silver after all others believed it lost at sea. He finds himself becoming a slave of the silver and its secret, even as he slowly recovers it ingot by ingot during nighttime trips to Great Isabel. The fate of Decoud is a mystery to Nostromo, which combined with the fact of the missing silver ingots only adds to his paranoia. Eventually a lighthouse is constructed on Great Isabel, threatening Nostromo&#x27;s ability to recover the treasure in secret. The ever resourceful Nostromo manages to have a close acquaintance, the widower Giorgio Viola, named as its keeper. Nostromo is in love with Giorgio&#x27;s younger daughter, but ultimately becomes engaged to his elder daughter Linda. One night while attempting to recover more of the silver, Nostromo is shot and killed, mistaken for a trespasser by old Giorgio.

== Major characters ==

* Nostromo (or Giovanni Battista Fidanza) – a charismatic Italian seaman who has settled in Sulaco and established a reputation for leadership and daring; as an employee of the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, he earns the unofficial title of the &quot;Capataz de Cargadores&quot;, or &quot;Head Longshoreman&quot;
* Charles &quot;don Carlos&quot; Gould, known as the &quot;King of Sulaco&quot; – an Englishman by ancestry and temperament, he is nevertheless a third generation Costaguanero; owner of the San Tomé Silver Mine, a bequest from his late father who was forced into ownership of the then derelict mine as repayment for many forced loans made to the corrupt government of Guzman Bento; the mine becomes his single-minded obsession

==Adaptations and translations==
Fox Film produced a lavish silent film version in 1926 called &quot;The Silver Treasure&quot; directed by Rowland V. Lee and starring George O&#x27;Brien. It is now a lost film.

In 1991, British director David Lean was to film the story of Nostromo, with Steven Spielberg producing it for Warner Bros., but Lean died a few weeks before the principal photography was to begin in Almería. Marlon Brando, Paul Scofield, Peter O&#x27;Toole, Isabella Rossellini, Christopher Lambert and Dennis Quaid had all been set to star in this adaptation, along with Georges Corraface in the title role.

In 1996, a television adaptation &quot;Nostromo&quot; was produced. It was adapted by John Hale and directed by Alastair Reid for the BBC, Radiotelevisione Italiana, Televisión Española, and WGBH Boston. It starred Claudio Amendola as Nostromo, and Colin Firth as Señor Gould.

The novel was translated to Polish for the first time in 1928 by . It received several other translations to Polish: in 1972 by , in 1981 by Jan Józef Szczepański and in 2023 by .

==References in other works==

* Andrew Greeley&#x27;s novel &quot;Virgin and Martyr&quot; (1985) has much of the story set in the fictional country of Costaguana. Many of the place names are borrowed from Conrad&#x27;s novel.
* In Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), the spacecraft is named the &quot;Nostromo&quot;; the escape vessel is named &quot;Narcissus&quot;, an allusion to another of Conrad&#x27;s works, &quot;The Nigger of the &quot;Narcissus&quot;&quot;. In James Cameron&#x27;s sequel &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), the Marine transport vessel is named &quot;Sulaco&quot;. Furthermore, appearing in the video game &quot;&quot;, a vessel of the same class as the &quot;Sulaco&quot; is named the &quot;Sephora&quot;, a reference to Conrad&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Sharer&quot;.
* In Dean Koontz&#x27;s novel &quot;Fear Nothing&quot; (1998), the protagonist Christopher Snow visits a man named Roosevelt Frost, who lives aboard a boat named &quot;Nostromo&quot;. 
* In the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; science fantasy franchise, &quot;Nostramo&quot; (&quot;nostramo&quot; is Catalan for &quot;nostromo&quot;, &quot;shipmate&quot; or &quot;boatswain&quot;), is the name of a corruption-ridden city world covered in unending darkness. Nostramo eventually falls under control of a brutal serial killer demigod named Konrad Curze, an allusion to the name of a central character in Conrad&#x27;s novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, later used by Francis Ford Coppola as the base for the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.
* Colombian writer Juan Gabriel Vásquez&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret History of Costaguana&quot; (2007) narrates the secession of Panamá from Colombia as the background story that (in this fictional work) served as Conrad&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;Nostromo&quot;.
* In the USA Network series &quot;Colony&quot;, the fighters of the Resistance use copies of the book as a decoder key for their encrypted communications.
* The travel writer John Gimlette suggests in his &quot;At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig: Travels through Paraguay&quot; (2003) that there are many similarities to Paraguay and its 19th-century history of despotism, war, and revolution: &quot;Conrad, meanwhile, was absorbing the Paraguayan story. His nightmarish political novel, &quot;Nostromo&quot;, emerged in 1904. It is Paraguay, seen through the prisms of his great friend&#x27;s [Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham] anger – Napoleonic dictators and a Great Conspiracy. There is even &#x27;a barefoot army of scarecrows&#x27; and a priest who becomes the state torturer.&quot; Graham arrived in Paraguay in 1873 and wrote many books on it.

<doc id="610616" wikidata="Q316070" url="?curid=610616" title="Fletcher Christian">
<text>Fletcher Christian (25 September 1764 – 20 September 1793) was an English sailor who led the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot; in 1789, during which he seized command of the Royal Navy vessel from Lieutenant William Bligh.

In 1787, Christian was appointed master&#x27;s mate on &quot;Bounty&quot;, tasked with transporting breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. Bligh subsequently named him acting-Lieutenant during the voyage. After a five-month layover in Tahiti, relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated and, in April 1789, Christian led a mutiny and forced Bligh from the ship. Some of the mutineers were left on Tahiti, while Christian, eight other mutineers, six Tahitian men and eleven Tahitian women settled on isolated Pitcairn Island, where they stripped and burned the vessel.

Christian died on Pitcairn, possibly killed in a conflict with Tahitians. His group was not found until 1808 and the sole surviving mutineer, John Adams, gave conflicting accounts of Christian&#x27;s death.

==Early life==
Fletcher Christian was born on 25 September 1764, at his family home of Moorland Close, Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth in Cumberland, England. His father&#x27;s side of the family had originated from the Isle of Man and most of Fletcher&#x27;s paternal great-grandfathers were historic Deemsters, their original family surname being McCrystyn.

Fletcher and his brothers Edward and Humphrey were the three sons of Charles Christian, an attorney-at-law descended from Manx gentry, and his wife Ann Dixon. Charles was heir of Moorland Close and of the large Ewanrigg Hall estate on the outskirts of Maryport, Cumberland.

Charles&#x27;s marriage to Ann brought with it the small property of Moorland Close, &quot;a quadrangle pile of buildings ... half castle, half farmstead.&quot; The property can be seen to the north of the Cockermouth to Egremont A5086 road. Charles died in 1768 when Fletcher was not yet four. Ann proved herself grossly irresponsible with money. By 1779, when Fletcher was fifteen, Ann had run up a debt of nearly £6,500 (equal to £ today), and faced the prospect of debtors&#x27; prison. Moorland Close was lost and Ann and her three younger children were forced to flee to the Isle of Man, to their relative&#x27;s estate, where English creditors had no power.

The three elder Christian sons managed to arrange a £40 (equal to £ today) per year annuity for their mother, allowing the family to live in genteel poverty. Christian spent seven years at the Cockermouth Free School from the age of nine. One of his younger contemporaries there was Cockermouth native William Wordsworth. It is commonly suggested that the two were &quot;school friends&quot;; in fact, Christian was six years older than Wordsworth. His mother Ann died on the Isle of Man in 1819.

==Naval career==
:&quot;See here for a comparison of assignments to William Bligh&quot;

Fletcher Christian began his naval career at a late age, joining the Royal Navy as a cabin boy when he was already seventeen years old (the average age for this position was between 12 and 15). He served for over a year on a third-rate ship-of-the-line along with his future commander, William Bligh, who was posted as the ship&#x27;s sixth lieutenant. Christian next became a midshipman on the sixth-rate post ship HMS &quot;Eurydice&quot; and was made Master&#x27;s Mate six months after the ship put to sea. The muster rolls of indicate Christian was signed on for a 21-month voyage to India. The ship&#x27;s muster shows Christian&#x27;s conduct was more than satisfactory because &quot;some seven months out from England, he had been promoted from midshipman to master&#x27;s mate&quot;.

After &quot;Eurydice&quot; had returned from India, Christian was reverted to midshipman and paid off from the Royal Navy. Unable to find another midshipman assignment, Christian decided to join the British merchant fleet and applied for a berth on board William Bligh&#x27;s ship &quot;Britannia&quot;. Bligh had himself been discharged from the Royal Navy and was now a merchant captain. Bligh accepted Christian on the ship&#x27;s books as an able seaman, but granted him all the rights of a ship&#x27;s officer including dining and berthing in the officer quarters. On a second voyage to Jamaica with Bligh, Christian was rated as the ship&#x27;s Second Mate.

In 1787 Bligh approached Christian to serve on board HMAV &quot;Bounty&quot; for a two-year voyage to transport breadfruit from Tahiti to the West Indies. Bligh originally had every intention of Christian serving as the ship&#x27;s Master, but the Navy Board turned down this request due to Christian&#x27;s low seniority in service years and appointed John Fryer instead. Christian was retained as Master&#x27;s Mate. The following year, halfway through the Bounty&#x27;s voyage, Bligh appointed Christian as acting lieutenant, thus making him senior to Fryer.

On 28 April 1789, Fletcher Christian led a mutiny on board the &quot;Bounty&quot; and from this point forward was considered an outlaw. He was formally stripped of his naval rank in March 1790 and discharged after Bligh returned to England and reported the mutiny to the Admiralty Board.

==Mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;==

In 1787, Christian was appointed master&#x27;s mate on &quot;Bounty&quot;, on Bligh&#x27;s recommendation, for the ship&#x27;s breadfruit expedition to Tahiti. During the voyage out, Bligh appointed him acting lieutenant. &quot;Bounty&quot; arrived at Tahiti on 26 October 1788 and Christian spent the next five months there.

&quot;Bounty&quot; set sail with its cargo of breadfruit plantings on 4 April 1789. Some 1,300 miles west of Tahiti, near Tonga, mutiny broke out on 28 April 1789, led by Christian. According to accounts, the sailors were attracted to the &quot;idyllic&quot; life and sexual opportunities afforded on the Pacific island of Tahiti. Following the court-martial of captured mutineers, Edward Christian argued that they were motivated by Bligh&#x27;s allegedly harsh treatment of them. Eighteen mutineers set Bligh afloat in a small boat with eighteen of the twenty-two crew loyal to him. Of those who went with Bligh only one man died (killed by natives); of those remaining after rescue:three died of malaria and two others were lost at sea. Bligh&#x27;s first detailed comments on the mutiny are in a letter to his wife Betsy, in which he names Peter Heywood (a mere boy not yet 17) as &quot;one of the ringleaders&quot;, adding: &quot;I have now reason to curse the day I ever knew a Christian or a Heywood or indeed a Manks man. Bligh&#x27;s later official account to the Admiralty lists Heywood with Christian, Edward Young and George Stewart as the mutiny&#x27;s leaders, describing Heywood as a young man of abilities for whom he had felt a particular regard. To the Heywood family Bligh wrote: &quot;His baseness is beyond all description.&quot; Heywood was found guilty but pardoned; Stewart drowned when the Pandora sank in 1791; Young slept through the mutiny although he did join the mutineers ex post facto.

Following the mutiny, Christian first travelled to Tahiti, where he married Maimiti, the daughter of one of the local chiefs. He then attempted to build a colony on Tubuai, but there the mutineers came into conflict with natives. Abandoning the island, he stopped briefly in Tahiti again, and dropped off sixteen crewmen. These sixteen included four Bligh loyalists who had been left behind on &quot;Bounty&quot; and two who had neither participated in, nor resisted, the mutiny. The remaining nine mutineers, six Tahitian men and eleven Tahitian women, then sailed eastward. In time, they landed on Pitcairn Island, where they stripped &quot;Bounty&quot; of all that could be floated ashore before Matthew Quintal set it on fire, stranding them. The resulting sexual imbalance, combined with the effective enslavement of the Tahitian men by the mutineers, led to insurrection and the deaths of most of the men.

==Death==
The American seal-hunting ship &quot;Topaz&quot; visited Pitcairn in 1808 and found only one mutineer, John Adams (who had used the alias Alexander Smith while on &quot;Bounty&quot;), still alive along with nine Tahitian women. The mutineers who had perished had, however, already had children with their Tahitian wives. Most of these children were still living. Adams and Maimiti claimed Christian had been murdered during the conflict between the Tahitian men and the mutineers. According to an account by a Pitcairn woman named Jenny who left the island in 1817, Christian was shot while working by a pond next to the home of his pregnant wife. Along with Christian, four other mutineers and all six of the Tahitian men who had come to the island were killed in the conflict. William McCoy, one of the four surviving mutineers, fell off a cliff while intoxicated and was killed. Quintal was later killed by the remaining two mutineers, Adams and Ned Young, after he attacked them. Young became the new leader of Pitcairn.

John Adams gave conflicting accounts of Christian&#x27;s death to visitors on ships that subsequently visited Pitcairn. He was variously said to have died of natural causes, committed suicide, become insane or been murdered.
Christian was survived by Maimiti and his son, Thursday October Christian (born 1790). Besides Thursday October, Fletcher Christian also had a younger son named Charles Christian (born 1792) and a daughter Mary Ann Christian (born 1793). Thursday and Charles are the ancestors of almost everybody with the surname Christian on Pitcairn and Norfolk Islands, as well as the many descendants who have moved to Australia, New Zealand and the United States.

Rumours have persisted for more than two hundred years that Christian&#x27;s murder was faked, that he had left the island and that he made his way back to England. Many scholars believe that the rumours of Christian returning to England helped to inspire Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.

There is no portrait or drawing extant of Fletcher Christian that was drawn from life. Bligh described Christian as &quot;5 ft. 9 in. high [175 cm]. blackish or very dark complexion. Hair – Blackish or very dark brown. Make – Strong. A star tatowed on his left breast, and tatowed on the backside. His knees stand a little out and he may be called a little bow legged. He is subject to violent perspiration, particularly in his hand, so that he soils anything he handles&quot;.

==In film and fiction==
===Appearances in literature===
Christian&#x27;s principal literary appearances are in the treatments of &quot;Bounty&quot; story, including &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1932), &quot;Pitcairn&#x27;s Island&quot; (1934) and &quot;After the Bounty&quot; (an edited version of James Morrison&#x27;s journal, 2009). He also appears in R. M. Ballantyne&#x27;s &quot;The Lonely Island; or, The Refuge of the Mutineers&quot; (1880) and in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Long Voyage&quot; (1853).

Stanley Miller&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Mr. Christian!&quot; posited that Christian knew nothing of the mutiny until it had been completely organized and he was offered the choice of being shot along with Bligh or taking command of the ship and the mutineers. In Peter F. Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Night&#x27;s Dawn&quot; trilogy, Fletcher Christian&#x27;s ghost appears, possessing a human body, and helps two non-possessed girls escape. William Kinsolving&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Mister Christian&quot; and Val McDermid&#x27;s 2006 thriller &quot;The Grave Tattoo&quot; are both based on Christian&#x27;s rumoured return to the Lake District and the fact that he was at school with William Wordsworth. Dan L. Thrapp&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Mutiny&#x27;s Curse &quot; is based on a similar premise. In 1959 Louis MacNeice produced a BBC Radio play called &quot;I Call Me Adam&quot;, written by Laurie Lee, about the mutineers&#x27; lives on Pitcairn.

===Film portrayals===

Christian is portrayed by:
* Wilton Powers (1916) &quot;The Mutiny of the Bounty&quot; 
* Errol Flynn (1933) &quot;In the Wake of the Bounty&quot; 
* Clark Gable (1935) &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; 
* Marlon Brando (1962) &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; 
* Mel Gibson (1984) &quot;The Bounty&quot;

The 1935 and 1962 films are based on the 1932 novel &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; in which Christian is a major character and is generally portrayed positively. The authors of that novel, Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, also wrote two sequels, one of which, &quot;Pitcairn&#x27;s Island&quot;, is the story of the tragic events after the mutiny that apparently resulted in Christian&#x27;s death along with other violent deaths on Pitcairn Island. (The other sequel, &quot;Men Against the Sea&quot;, is the story of Bligh&#x27;s voyage after the mutiny.) This series of novels uses fictionalised versions of minor crew members as narrators of the stories. The 1984 film offers a less sympathetic image of Christian.

===Musical portrayals===
* Four Jacks &quot;The Story of Bounty&quot; (1962)
* The Rolling Stones &quot;Dancing in the Light&quot; (1972)
* David Essex in &quot;Mutiny!&quot; (1985)
* Mekons &quot;(Sometimes I Feel Like) Fletcher Christian&quot; from &quot;So Good It Hurts&quot; (Sin Record Company/Cooking Vinyl, Rough Trade Records Germany) (1988)

<doc id="610617" wikidata="Q492905" url="?curid=610617" title="Diastole">
<text>Diastole ( ) is the relaxed phase of the cardiac cycle when the chambers of the heart are refilling with blood. The contrasting phase is systole when the heart chambers are contracting. Atrial diastole is the relaxing of the atria, and ventricular diastole the relaxing of the ventricles.

The term originates from the Greek word (&quot;diastolē&quot;), meaning &quot;dilation&quot;, from (&quot;diá&quot;, &quot;apart&quot;) + (&quot;stéllein&quot;, &quot;to send&quot;).

==Role in cardiac cycle==

A typical heart rate is 75 beats per minute (bpm), which means that the cardiac cycle that produces one heartbeat, lasts for less than one second. The cycle requires 0.3 sec in ventricular systole (contraction)—pumping blood to all body systems from the two ventricles; and 0.5 sec in diastole (dilation), re-filling the four chambers of the heart, for a total of 0.8 sec to complete the cycle.

===Early ventricular diastole===

During early ventricular diastole, pressure in the two ventricles begins to drop from the peak reached during systole. When the pressure in the left ventricle falls below that in the left atrium, the mitral valve opens due to a negative pressure differential (suction) between the two chambers. The open mitral valve allows blood in the atrium (accumulated during atrial diastole) to flow into the ventricle (see graphic at top). Likewise, the same phenomenon runs simultaneously in the right ventricle and right atrium through the tricuspid valve.

The ventricular filling flow (or flow from the atria into the ventricles) has an early (E) diastolic component caused by ventricular suction, and then a late one created by atrial systole (A). The E/A ratio is used as a diagnostic measure as its diminishment indicates probable diastolic dysfunction, though this should be used in conjunction with other clinical characteristics and not by itself.

===Late ventricular diastole===

Early diastole is a suction mechanism between the atrial and ventricular chambers. Then, in late ventricular diastole, the two atrial chambers contract (atrial systole), causing blood pressure in both atria to increase and forcing additional blood flow into the ventricles. This beginning of the atrial systole is known as the &quot;atrial kick&quot;—see Wiggers diagram. The atrial kick &quot;does not&quot; supply the larger amount of flow (during the cardiac cycle) as about 80 percent of the collected blood volume flows into the ventricles during the active suction period.

===Atrial diastole===

At the beginning of the cardiac cycle the atria, and the ventricles are synchronously approaching and retreating from relaxation and dilation, or diastole. The atria are filling with separate blood volumes returning to the right atrium (from the vena cavae), and to the left atrium (from the lungs). After chamber and back pressures equalize, the mitral and tricuspid valves open, and the returning blood flows through the atria into the ventricles. When the ventricles have completed most of their filling, the atria begin to contract (atrial systole), forcing blood under pressure into the ventricles. Now the ventricles start to contract, and as pressures within the ventricles rise, the mitral and tricuspid valves close producing the first heart sound (S1) as heard with a stethoscope.

As pressures within the ventricles continue to rise, they exceed the &quot;back pressures&quot; in the aorta, and the pulmonary trunk. The aortic and pulmonary valves known as the semilunar valves open, and a defined fraction of blood within the heart is ejected into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. Ejection of blood from the heart is known as systole. Ejection causes pressure within the ventricles to fall, and, simultaneously, the atria begin to refill (atrial diastole). Finally, pressures within the ventricles fall below the back pressures in the aorta and the pulmonary arteries, and the semilunar valves close. Closure of these valves give the second heart sound (S2). The ventricles then start to relax, the mitral and tricuspid valves begin to open, and the cycle begins again.

In summary, when the ventricles are in systole and contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting returning blood. When, in late diastole, the ventricles become fully dilated (understood in imaging as LVEDV and RVEDV), the atria begin to contract, pumping blood to the ventricles. The atria feed a steady supply of blood to the ventricles, thereby serving as a reservoir to the ventricles and ensuring that these pumps never run dry. This coordination ensures that blood is pumped and circulated efficiently throughout the body.

==Clinical notation==
Blood pressure is usually written with the systolic pressure expressed over the diastolic pressure or separated by a slash, for example, 120/80 mmHg. This clinical notation is not a mathematical figure for a fraction or ratio, nor a display of a numerator over a denominator, rather it is a medical notation showing the two clinically significant pressures involved. It is often shown followed by a third value, the number of beats per minute of the heart rate. 

Mean blood pressure is also an important determinant in people who have had certain medical interventions like Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) and hemodialysis that replace pulsatile flow with continuous blood flow.

==Diagnostic value==
Examining diastolic function during a cardiac stress test is a good way to test for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Classification of blood pressure in adults:
==Effects of impaired diastolic function==
Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac neurohormone secreted from ventricular myocytes (ventricular muscle cells) at the end of diastole—this in response to the normal, or sub-normal (as the case may be), stretching of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) during systole. Elevated levels of BNP indicate excessive natriuresis (excretion of sodium to the urine) and decline of ventricular function, especially during diastole. Increased BNP concentrations have been found in patients who experience diastolic heart failure.

Impaired diastolic function can result from the &quot;decreased compliance of ventricular myocytes&quot;, and thus the ventricles, which means the heart muscle does not stretch as much as needed during filling. This will result in a reduced end diastolic volume (EDV) and, according to the Frank-Starling mechanism, a reduced EDV will lead to a reduced stroke volume, thus a reduced cardiac output. Over time, decreased cardiac output will diminish the ability of the heart to circulate blood efficiently throughout the body. Degradation of compliance in the myocardium is a natural consequence of aging.

<text>The Well of Lost Plots is a novel by Jasper Fforde, published in 2003. It is the third book in the Thursday Next series, after &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; and &quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Apprentice Jurisfiction agent and SpecOps-27 operative Thursday Next is taking a vacation inside &quot;Caversham Heights&quot;, a never-published detective novel inside the titular Well of Lost Plots, while waiting for her child to be born. In the book, she encounters two Generics, students of St Tabularasa&#x27;s who have yet to be assigned to a book, and DCI Jack Spratt, a detective who partners with her in investigating a murder. Since Thursday is an &quot;Outlander&quot;, a &quot;real&quot; person rather than a fictional character, Spratt hopes that she will help them appeal to the Council of Genres to prevent the disassembling of &quot;Caversham Heights&quot;, a fate inevitable for books which languish unpublished in the real world.

Using a &quot;Caversham Heights&quot; as her base of operations, Thursday continues her apprenticeship with Miss Havisham from &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Meanwhile, fictional character Yorrick Kaine is loose in Thursday&#x27;s real world and conspiring with someone in Text Grand Central, the final arbitrators of plot, setting, and other story elements, to release BOOK version 9, code-named UltraWord. UltraWord is touted at a Jurisfiction meeting as the greatest advance &quot;since the invention of movable type&quot; because it creates a thirty-two plot story system and allows the reader to control the story.

Thursday slowly loses her memory of Landen, though Gran Next remains with her and keeps her from forgetting him completely. In doing so, she also battles Aornis Hades, the villainess, who nearly converted the world to Dream Topping in &quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot;, who is present in her memory as a mindworm. Thursday learns that Harris Tweed, Kaine&#x27;s partner, is masquerading as a Jurisfiction agent to get UltraWord released, which he states will &quot;fix literature&quot;. She investigates the details of UltraWord and makes some alarming discoveries.

At the 923rd Annual BookWorld awards, Thursday demonstrates a variety of issues with UltraWord; it makes books impossible to read more than three times, thus rendering libraries and second-hand bookstores useless, and the quality of the writing is also substantively poorer. Tweed and Kaine call for a vote before the audience can be convinced by Thursday&#x27;s argument. In this unprecedented emergency, Thursday uses her Jurisfiction operative TravelBook to summon The Great Panjandrum, ruler of the BookWorld and literal &quot;deus ex machina&quot;. The Panjandrum calls for an immediate vote which goes against UltraWord and calls on Thursday to take the job of Bellman, the superintendent of Jurisfiction. Thursday accepts the position.

In the aftermath of the BookWorld awards, the two Generics, now calling themselves Randolph and Lola, Thursday, and her pet dodo Pickwick retire to &quot;Caversham Heights&quot;, which was bought by the Council of Genres as a character sanctuary, a solution that appeals to the residents of the novel as well as the nursery rhyme characters who were going to go on strike. The story of the new &quot;Caversham Heights&quot; constitutes Fforde&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;The Big Over Easy&quot;.

The American edition has an extra chapter at the end, documenting the weathering of a WordStorm during Thursday&#x27;s tenure as Bellman.

==Characters==

*Thursday Next - Jurisfiction detective and protagonist of the series.
*Pickwick - Thursday&#x27;s pet dodo.
*Randolph and Lola - a pair of generic characters who Thursday assists in developing distinct identities.
*Harris Tweed - A Jurisfiction agent from the real world.
*The Great Panjandrum - the supposed creator of the Bookworld and a literal &quot;deus ex machina&quot;.
*Aornis Hades - a duplicate of the villain of the previous novel, &quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot;, who exists inside Thursday&#x27;s memories and attempts to alter them to destructive effect.
*Gran Next - Thursday&#x27;s grandmother, she comes to stay with her inside &quot;Caversham Heights&quot; and assist her in battling Aornis and recovering her lost memories.
*Landen Parke-Laine - Thursday&#x27;s husband, a noted novelist, who at the time of &quot;The Well of Lost Plots&quot; has been erased from history by the Chronoguard and exists only in her memories.
*The Bellman - the head of Jurisfiction.

==Reception==
&quot;The Well of Lost Plots&quot; was released to positive reviews. Rich Horton of The SF Site referred to it as &quot;a fast-moving, funny, and intellectually diverting novel&quot; and Dave Golder of &quot;SFX&quot; stated that &quot;a book this self-consciously clever has no right being so much damned fun&quot; and rated it five stars. The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described it as &quot;a wildly imaginative, pun-filled bundle of literary allusions, satire, criticism and delightful silliness.&quot; Fforde won the Wodehouse prize for comic fiction in 2004 for &quot;The Well of Lost Plots&quot;.

<text>Antoni Muntadas (born 1942 in Barcelona) is a postconceptual multimedia artist, who resides in New York since 1971. His work often addresses social, political and communications issues through different media: such as photography, video, text and image publications, the Internet, and multi-media installations.

==Artwork==
From a critical perspective, his work addresses social, political, and communications issues from all around the world, such as the relationship between public and private space within specific social frameworks, and investigates channels of information, and the ways they may be used to censor or promulgate ideas. Following this line, he coined the terms &quot;media landscape&quot; – to allude the &quot;ever-expanding presence&quot; of mass media, advertising and audiovisual material in the public space – and &quot;critical subjectivity&quot; – to refer to the critical modes of perception, thought, and subject configuration. These concepts are key to understand his artistic proposal.

His projects are presented in different mediums, such as photography, video, publications, the Internet, installations and urban interventions, and have been exhibited in numerous museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Berkeley Art Museum in California, the Musée Contemporain de Montreal, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, the Museo de Arte Moderno in Buenos Aires, the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro, the Musée Jeu de Paume in Paris and the Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona, among others. In addition, his works have been presented in different international events: VI and X editions of Documenta Kassel (1977, 1997), the Whitney Biennal of American Art (1991), the 51st Venice Biennial (1976, 2005) and those in São Paulo, Lyon, Taipei, Gwangju, Istanbul and La Havana. Muntadas with the Catalan artist Antoni Miralda held a collective exhibition at the PalmaDotze gallery in Santa Margarida los Monjos (Penedès) to celebrate its 30th anniversary.

Within the academic field, Muntadas has taught and directed seminars at diverse institutions throughout Europe and the United States, including the National School of Fine Arts in Paris, the Fine Arts Schools in Bordeaux and Grenoble, the University of California in San Diego, the San Francisco Art Institute, the Cooper Union in New York, the Fine Arts Academy in Beijing (CAFA), the Art University in Tokyo, the University of São Paulo, and the University of Buenos Aires. He has also been invited as a resident artist and consulting advisor at various research and education centers including the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, the Banff Centre in Alberta, Arteleku in San Sebastian, The National Studio for Contemporary Arts Le Fresnoy, and the University of Western Sydney. He maintained a relationship with the MIT in Cambridge for longer than 35 years (1977-2014), which is of special importance. There, Muntadas first exercised as a research fellow, then as a lecturer and professor in practice. Currently, he is teaching at the Veneto Institute of Architecture in Venice.

Muntadas has received several prizes and grants, including those of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, Arts Electronica in Linz, Laser d&#x27;Or in Locarno, the Premi Nacional d’Arts Plàstiques awarded by the Catalan Government and the 2005 National Award for Plastic Arts (Spain). One of his most recent awards is the Premio Velázquez de las Artes Plásticas 2009 granted by the Spanish Ministry of Culture. In 2016 he was invited to Geneva in the framework of the Arts at CERN programme.

<doc id="610624" wikidata="Q867738" url="?curid=610624" title="Christian school">
<text>A Christian school is a religious school run on Christian principles or by a Christian organization. These schools often include religious education and worship in their curriculum. They may also have a distinct Christian mission or philosophy.

The nature of Christian schools varies enormously from country to country, according to the religious, educational, and political cultures. In some countries, there is a strict separation of church and state, so all religious schools are private; in others, there is an established church whose teachings form an integral part of the state-operated educational system; in yet others, the state subsidizes religious schools of various denominations.

== Background ==
Traditionally, many Christian denominations have seen providing catechesis as a necessary part of the educational formation of children; the Emmanuel Association of Churches, a Methodist denomination in the conservative holiness movement teaches, for example:

To this end, Christian Churches have established schools around the world.

== North America ==
=== United States ===
In the United States, religion is generally not taught by state-funded educational systems, though schools must allow students wanting to study religion to do so as an extracurricular activity, as they would with any other such activity.

Over 4 million students, about 1 child in 12, attend religious schools, most of them Christian.

There is great variety in the educational and religious philosophies of these schools, as might be expected from the large number of religious denominations in the United States.

==== Baptist ====

The Southern Baptist Convention has various affiliated primary and secondary schools, gathered in the Southern Baptist Association of Christian Schools.

==== Catholic ====

The largest system of Christian education in the United States is operated by the Catholic Church. , there were 6,841 elementary and secondary schools enrolling about 2.2 million students. Most are administered by individual dioceses and parishes.

==== Lutheran ====

The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (the primary conservative Lutheran denomination in the US) operates the largest Protestant school system in the United States. , the LCMS operated 1,127 early childhood centers and preschools, 778 elementary schools, and 87 high schools. These schools educated more than 200,000 students and are taught by 21,000 teachers. Lutheran schools operated by the LCMS also exist in Hong Kong and mainland China. The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod currently operates 403 early childhood centers, 313 elementary schools, and 25 high schools .

==== Episcopal ====
The Episcopal Church in the United States of America maintains approximately 1,200 schools, of which about 50 are secondary schools and which educate about 2% of all students in private schools or 0.22% (115,000 students) of the school population in the United States. Although there are relatively few Episcopal schools, many, such as the Groton School in Massachusetts and St Paul&#x27;s in New Hampshire, and have played a significant role in the development of the American prep school. Episcopal schools are far more likely to be independent, with little outside control, than their Roman Catholic counterparts. Many Episcopal high schools have an annual tuition well in excess of $15,000, slightly higher the average for non-sectarian private schools and far higher than the average for non-Roman Catholic religious schools (approx. $7,100 per annum) and over twice the average for Roman Catholic high schools (approx. $6,000 per annum).

==== Methodist ====
The United Methodist Church and Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection operate parochial schools and colleges throughout the United States.

==== Conservative Evangelical ====
Many conservative Evangelicals in the United States reserve the term &quot;Christian school&quot; for schools affiliated with conservative Evangelical denominations, often excluding Catholic schools in particular.

These conservative Evangelical schools are privately run, often in conjunction with a church or a denomination. Parents who want their children taught according to the principles of their church, can choose to send their children to such schools, but unless the school is subsidized by their church, or is part of a school choice or education voucher program funded by the government, they must pay tuition. Some American Evangelical schools are large and well-funded, while others are small and rely on volunteers from the community.

Some Evangelical schools, especially those sponsored by fundamentalist groups, do not accept government funding and subsidies because (in their opinion) they would put their school (and potentially their church) operations under more government scrutiny and legislation, which can lead to the government dictating their school&#x27;s operation (and, possibly, the church&#x27;s teachings on controversial subjects such as abortion or homosexuality). An example of this would be a requirement to adhere to a state&#x27;s civil rights law, in exchange for the subsidy, this would conflict with a Christian school that has mandatory religious requirements for admission, or does not allow its students to opt out of attending religious services. Even though a school may accept no government money, it still must adhere to the state education curriculum, student academic performance standards, and state-mandated standardized testing scores (if any). It is also subject to standard inspection by government regulators for in-classroom teaching quality and teacher qualifications, possibly including visiting classes. Not accepting government money avoids government management of an Evangelical school, but does not remove governmental oversight.

Another large association of Evangelical schools is the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). ACSI serves 5,300 member schools in approximately 100 countries with an enrollment of nearly 1.2 million students. The American Association of Christian Schools, founded in 1972, brings together many conservative Evangelical schools. Members subscribe to a &quot;Statement of Faith&quot; based on Biblical literalism, creationism, and a rejection of ecumenism. AACS member schools enroll over 100,000 students. The AACS has an active lobbying program in Washington.

Another association of Evangelical schools is Christian Schools International, with approximately 500 schools and 100,000 students.

One movement among Evangelical schools in the U.S. is the return to the traditional subjects and form of education known as classical education. This growing movement is known as the Classical Christian School movement, represented by the Association of Classical &amp; Christian Schools, with over 230 schools and colleges, and about 34,000 students.

==== Adventist ====
According to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest Protestant school system in the world is the Seventh-day Adventist educational system. The Seventh-day Adventist Church has a total of 6,709 educational institutions operating in over 100 countries around the world with over 1.2 million students worldwide. The North American Division Office of Education oversees 1,049 schools with 65,000 students in the United States, Canada, and Bermuda.

==== Mennonites ====
Conservative Mennonites, Old Order Mennonites, and Amish groups all operate their own private schools and have published their own curriculum since the early 1960s.

==== Other ====
The Eastern Orthodox Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also operate parochial private schools throughout the United States.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, public funding of religious education is permitted and sometimes required. Many Christian schools in Canada are non-denominational, meaning they&#x27;re not affiliated with a specific branch of Christianity. Other schools are denominational; they are affiliated with a particular branch. For instance, they might be Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, or follow some other denomination. Among these, Catholic schools receive the most funding from the government; many of them receive funding for both the secular and religious component of their curriculum.

Historically, &quot;Christian schools&quot; in Canada were run by private Catholic or Protestant organizations. As public education developed, the majority (usually Protestant) faith became represented by the public school, and the minority faith (usually Catholic) became represented by a separate school. Over time, the public schools became increasingly secularized as Canadian society became increasingly pluralistic.

Most provinces originally had separate school boards in each school district for Catholic and non-Catholic students. Many provinces have abolished this, but Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories retain the system. Where this occurs, the two schools are usually called the &quot;Catholic School Board&quot; and the &quot;Public School Board&quot;.

Many non-Catholic Christians send their children to separate Catholic schools, preferring their values and standards, despite not practicing the Catholic faith. Typically, such students are exempt from specific religious instruction classes.

The American model is also used on some private schools, usually run by Protestant denominations.

Public school boards (as distinct from Catholic boards) in Canada normally have no religious affiliation in modern times but may still accommodate religious instruction for Christians within their community. They may do this by creating an individual special purpose Christian school, or they may offer religious instruction within an otherwise secular school. This practice has become so prevalent in Alberta that many private Christian schools have been absorbed by their local public districts as &quot;alternative Christian programs&quot; within the public system. They are presently permitted to retain their philosophy, curriculum, and staffing while operating as fully funded public schools. In this regard, they have achieved some equality with Catholic schools.

These private schools can be associated with a number of different organizations. Some are affiliated with the Association of Christian Schools International, some with Christian Schools International, and some with other organizations. There are also provincial organizations like the Ontario Alliance of Christian Schools a d the Prairie Association of Christian Schools.

== Europe ==
=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, church schools are more generally referred to as faith schools. In 2012, 33.75% of all maintained schools and 23.13% of all academies in England were faith schools, a total of 6,830 institutions.

The Church of England was historically a provider of many schools throughout England. Such schools (called &#x27;Church of England schools&#x27;) were partially absorbed into the state education system (in the Education Act 1944), with the church retaining an influence on the schools in return for its support in funding and staffing. Such schools are required to accept pupils regardless of religious background, though if they are oversubscribed, they can, and often do, give preference to applicants of the relevant faith. As of February 2017, there are 3,731 state schools and 906 academies in England that are church schools. Approximately one quarter of all primary schools in England are Church of England schools and 15 million people alive today went to a Church of England school.
Because of the availability of church-run schools and the tolerance for religious activity in state schools, private Christian schools are a relative rarity, but do exist throughout the country. One of the larger ones, the Liverpool Christian Fellowship School, made national headlines in 2001 when they led a campaign backed by forty other schools, to retain their right to use caning and other corporal punishments, which was outlawed in 1999. They intended to halt what they felt was a decline of discipline within schools. Other Christian schools include Kingsfold Christian School in Lancashire, Carmel Christian School in Bristol, Grangewood Independent School in London, Mannafields Christian School in Edinburgh, Emmanuel Christian School in Leicester, Derby &amp; Walsall, &amp; The River School in Worcester, among others.

=== The Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands the question whether or not public schools should be Christian and in what way was subject of much debate between 1806 and 1917. During the second half of the 19th century this school struggle reached its summit and dominated politics along with voting rights and the district system. In 1917 most of these three matters were resolved by the Pacification of 1917. From then on both confessional (religious) and public schools would get equal funding. Schools grounded in a religious denomination are treated as a type of distinct education (&quot;bijzonder onderwijs&quot;) and governed by their own institutions separate from that for mainstream schools.

In the second half of 2006 there were 6,318 Christian schools in the Netherlands; 4,955 primary schools, 1,054 high schools and 309 colleges and universities.

=== Russia ===
Russian Orthodoxy is the major form of Christianity practiced in Russia. The Orthodox Church began systemic participation in the elementary education field in Russia in 1884 under the &quot;Statute on Church-parish schools&quot;. In the following two decades, many privately initiated, illegal &quot;literacy schools&quot; started by peasants were also regularised by placing them under the control of the Church. Privately founded Orthodox schools not under direct church control played an important role in the spread of Orthodoxy among Russian minorities, prominent examples being the Kazan Central Baptised Tatar School, founded in 1863, or the Simbirsk Central Chuvash School, founded in 1868.

There are also Protestant-associated schools aimed at the children of expatriates, such as the International Academy of St. Petersburg, Russia, founded in 1993.

== Oceania ==
=== Australia ===
Parochial schools (Church schools) were established in Australia by both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches during the 19th century. Many of these schools, many of which with long traditions, continue to form the bulk of the private or independent school sector in Australia.

The modern Protestant Christian school movement began in Australia through the efforts of Dutch migrants who had enjoyed Christian schools for many decades in their home country. Most belonged to one of the Australian reformed churches of Dutch origin (the Christian Reformed Churches of Australia or the Free Reformed Churches of Australia, sometimes incorrectly called the Dutch Reformed Church, which is a name used in the Netherlands, South Africa and Sri Lanka but never in the Australian context). During the 1950s these migrants founded associations of parents who wanted to start Christian schools, and the first schools opened, at first without any government assistance, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

The Free Reformed Church started the John Calvin School at Armadale, Western Australia which opened its doors on 2 December 1957 with 70 students. It was followed by schools in Albany, Western Australia (1962) and Launceston, Tasmania (1965). The Reformed Churches of Australia (which added &#x27;Christian&#x27; to the beginning of their name only in the 1990s) opened their first school at Kingston, Tasmania in 1962. Their first schools were affiliated with a national body known at that time as the National Union of Christian Parent-Controlled Schools, which later became Christian Parent Controlled Schools Ltd. (CPCS), and in 2008 was again renamed to become Christian Education National.

Whereas the Free Reformed schools enrolled only students from that particular denomination, the Reformed Church-initiated schools were operated by associations of parents who individually belonged to a variety of Protestant churches and who worked collectively for their common aim. These schools were established not because of innate dissatisfaction with government schools, but because these parents wanted schools which would actively integrate their Christian faith into the whole school curriculum. The schools were operated by parent bodies apart from supervision of churches.

From the late 1970s, Christians from many other churches became increasingly concerned about standards and social change in government schools and started establishing Christian schools to provide an alternative education option. In this phase, many such schools were commenced not by parent associations but by churches themselves, although several parent groups from outside the Reformed Churches studied and adopted the parent-controlled model and have commenced schools which, while they have no Dutch or Reformed Church connections, have still affiliated themselves nationally with many schools which do.

The leading umbrella organizations include Anglican Schools Australia, Christian Schools Australia, Lutheran Education Australia (LEA), Christian Education National (formerly Christian Parent Controlled Schools Ltd), and the Australian Association of Christian Schools. This last body mainly functions as a political advisory and lobby group for Christian Education National as well as a number of Christian schools who are members independently.

== Africa ==

In many parts of Africa Christian missionary organisations have founded schools, often in places where no other schooling is available. Such schools generally provide a complete education in a Christian context. In Nigeria, Living Faith Church Worldwide has established several educational institutions, including Covenant University, Landmark University and Faith Academy.

A Pew Center study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that &quot;there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in sub-Saharan Africa&quot; as Muslim adults in this region are far less educated than their Christian counterparts, with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the educational facilities that were created by Christian missionaries during the colonial era for fellow believers.

==Asia==
=== Israel ===

According to the study &quot;Are Christian Arabs the New Israeli Jews? Reflections on the Educational Level of Arab Christians in Israel&quot; by Hanna David from the University of Tel Aviv, one of the factors why Arab Christians are the most educated segment of Israel&#x27;s population is the high level of the Christian educational institutions. Christian schools in Israel are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from Christian schools, and about 87% of the Israeli Arabs in the high tech sector have been educated in Christian schools. 

Many Druze and Muslims attend Christian schools in Israel, because Christian schools are high-performing and among the best schools in the country.

=== Lebanon ===

Since the sixteenth century, prominent Druze feudal families have welcomed Protestant missionaries, as well as, Catholic missionaries like Franciscans, Jesuits, Carmelites, and Lazarites to the region, all of whom contributed to the spread of education and literacy. Under Fakhr al-Din II rule, printing presses were introduced and Jesuit priests and Catholic monks and nuns encouraged to open schools throughout Mount Lebanon. In 1791, Pope Pius VI sent a letter to Bashir Jumblatt, expressing gratitude for allowing the Maronites to build more churches in the Chouf area. 

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Protestant missionaries established schools and churches in Druze strongholds, with some Druze converting to Protestant Christianity. In 1870 many Christian schools were opened in Lebanon, which were among the main centers of the renaissance (Nahda) and this led to the establishment of schools, universities, theater and printing presses. The remainder of the 19th century saw a relative period of stability, as Druze and Maronite groups focused on economic and cultural development which saw the founding of the American University of Beirut (Syrian Protestant College) and Saint Joseph University and a flowering of literary and political activity associated with the attempts to liberalize the Ottoman Empire.

<text>George Newbold Lawrence (October 20, 1806 – January 17, 1895) was an American businessman and amateur ornithologist.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in the city of New York on October 20, 1806.

From his youth, Lawrence was a lover of birds and spent much of his spare time studying their habits. At sixteen years of age, he became a clerk in his father&#x27;s business, becoming a partner in his father&#x27;s house by age twenty.

==Career==
Lawrence conducted Pacific bird surveys for Spencer Fullerton Baird and John Cassin, and the three men co-authored &quot;Birds of North America&quot; in 1860.

He sold his collection of 8,000 bird skins to the American Museum of Natural History in 1887.

Fellow ornithologists honored him by naming one bird genus and 20 species after him, including both the scientific and common name of the Lawrence&#x27;s goldfinch, first described by Cassin in 1852.

==Personal life==
Lawrence died on January 17, 1895, in New York City. His funeral was held at his residence, 45 East 21st Street in Manhattan. His wife died five days later on January 22, 1895. Their combined estates totaled $528,900 which were left to their two sons, Elmen N. Lawrence and John B. Lawrence.

<doc id="610628" wikidata="Q918867" url="?curid=610628" title="Kanawha River">
<text>The Kanawha River ( ) is a tributary of the Ohio River, approximately 97 mi (156 km) long, in the U.S. state of West Virginia. The largest inland waterway in West Virginia, its watershed has been a significant industrial region of the state since early in the 19th century.

It is formed at the town of Gauley Bridge in northwestern Fayette County, approximately 35 mi (56 km) SE of Charleston, by the confluence of the New and Gauley rivers 2 mi upstream from Kanawha Falls. The waterfall is 24 ft high and has been a barrier to fish movement for more than 1 million years. The river flows generally northwest, in a winding course on the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau, through Fayette, Kanawha, Putnam, and Mason counties, past the cities of Charleston and St. Albans, and numerous smaller communities. It joins the Ohio at Point Pleasant. An environmental overview and summary of natural and human factors affecting water quality in the watershed was published in 2000.

Paleo-Indians, the earliest indigenous peoples, lived in the valley and the heights by 10,000 BC as evidenced by archaeological artifacts such as Clovis points. A succession of prehistoric cultures developed, with the Adena culture beginning the construction of numerous skilled earthwork mounds and enclosures more than 2000 years ago. Some of the villages of the Fort Ancient culture survived into the times of European contact.

The area was a place of competition among historical American Indian nations. Invading from their base in present-day New York, the Iroquois drove out or conquered Fort Ancient culture peoples, as well as such tribes as the Huron and Conoy. By right of conquest, the Iroquois, Lenape (Delaware), and Shawnee reserved the area as a hunting ground. They resisted European-American settlement during the colonial years. Eventually the settlers took over by right of conquest.

== Economy ==
The watershed contains significant deposits of coal and natural gas. As of 1998, about 7 percent of the coal mined in the United States came from the Kanawha River watershed.
A thriving chemical industry along the river banks provides a significant part of the local economy.

In colonial times, the wildly fluctuating level of the river prevented its use for transportation. The removal of boulders and snags on the lower river in the 1840s allowed navigation, which was extended upriver by the construction of locks and dams by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers starting in 1875. By 1898 the project made the Kanawha the first fully controlled river navigation system in America. The river is now navigable for barge traffic to Deepwater, an unincorporated community about upriver from Charleston.

==Recreation==
===Fishing===
Multiple West Virginia state record fish were caught along the Bluestone Lake.

== Hydrology and ecology ==
In addition to the New and Gauley River headwaters, the Kanawha is joined at Charleston by the Elk River, at St. Albans by the Coal River, and at Poca by the Pocatalico River.

Major impoundments in the Kanawha River watershed include Claytor Lake and Bluestone Lake on the New River, Summersville Lake on the Gauley River, and Sutton Lake on the Elk River. Collectively, they have a capacity of 14 percent of the average annual flow at Charleston. The reservoirs on New and Gauley Rivers reduced the estimated 100-year flood discharge under 20th-century climate by about half at Kanawha Falls.

Kanawha Falls is the upstream limit of several fish species that broadly inhabit the Ohio River watershed. 
Above the waterfall, the watershed has fewer fish species overall, a relatively high number of species found nowhere else in the world, and nearly as many non-native species as natives.

==Geography==
The Kanawha River lends its name to a major geological section of the Appalachian Highlands physiographic region of the United States called a physiographic region. A physiographic region is a large portion of land that is grouped by several factors. Each region has similar geology, topography, and groups of plants and animals. There are eight physiographic divisions in the 48 contiguous United States. Each division is divided into provinces, there are 25 provinces in the United States. Each province is then divided into sections, creating 85 different physiographic sections in the United States. The Kanawha section is one of those 85 sections.

The Kanawha section encompasses areas of Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. The two major cities in the section are Pittsburgh, PA and Charleston, WV.

==Name==
&quot;Ka(ih)nawha&quot; derives from the region&#x27;s Iroquoian dialects meaning &quot;water way&quot; or &quot;canoe way&quot; implying the metaphor, &quot;transport way&quot;, in the local language. The glottal consonant of the &quot;ih&quot; (stream or river, local Iroquois) dropped out as settlers and homesteaders arrived. Some say that it comes from a Shawnee word that means &quot;new water&quot; or that its a Catawba word meaning &quot;friendly brother&quot;.

The river has also had historical alternate names, alternate spellings and misspellings including Wood&#x27;s River for the tributary known today as the New River, for Colonel Abraham Wood, an English explorer from Virginia, the first European known to have explored the river in the mid-17th century.

==History==
Archaeological artifacts, such as Clovis points and later projectiles, indicate prehistoric indigenous peoples living in the area from the 12,500 BC era. Peoples of later cultures continued to live along the valley and heights. Those of the Adena culture built at least 50 earthwork mounds and 10 enclosures in the area between Charleston and Dunbar, as identified by an 1882 to 1884 survey by the Bureau of Ethnology (later part of the Smithsonian Institution). Three of their mounds survive in the valley, including Criel Mound at present-day South Charleston, West Virginia. Evidence has been found of the Fort Ancient culture peoples, who had villages that survived to the time of European contact, such as Buffalo and Marmet. They were driven out by Iroquois from present-day New York.

According to French missionary reports, by the late 16th century, several thousand Huron, originally of the Great Lakes region, lived in central West Virginia. They were partially exterminated and their remnant driven out in the 17th century by the Iroquois&#x27; invading from western present-day New York. Other accounts note that the tribe known as &quot;Conois&quot;, &quot;Conoy,&quot; &quot;Canawesee&quot;, or Kanawha were conquered or driven out by the large Seneca tribe, one of the Iroquois Confederacy, as the Seneca boasted to Virginia colonial officials in 1744. The Iroquois and other tribes, such as the Shawnee and Delaware, maintained central West Virginia as a hunting ground. It was essentially unpopulated when the English and Europeans began to move into the area.

The first white person to travel through Virginia all the way to the Ohio River (other than as a prisoner of the Indians) was Matthew Arbuckle, Sr., who traversed the length of the Kanawha River valley arriving at (what would later be called) Point Pleasant around 1764. In April 1774, Captain Hanson was one of an expedition: &quot;18th. We surveyed of Land for Col. Washington, bordered by Coal River &amp; the Canawagh...&quot; This area is the lower area of today&#x27;s St. Albans, West Virginia. After the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, &quot;The Kanawhas had gone from the upper tributaries of the river which bears their name, to join their kinsmen, the Iroquois in New York; the Shawnee had abandoned the Indian Old Fields of the valley of the South Branch of the Potomac; the Delaware were gone from the Monongahela; the Cherokee who claimed all the region between the Great Kanawha and Big Sandy, had never occupied it.&quot; quoting Virgil A. Lewis (1887), corresponding member of the Virginia Historical Society. The river&#x27;s name changes to the Kanawha River at the Kanawha Falls. The Treaty of Big Tree between the Seneca nation and the United States established ten reservations. This formal treaty was signed on September 15, 1797. Lewis was granted a large tract of land near the mouth of the Great Kanawha River in the late 18th century.

The Little Kanawha and the Great Kanawha rivers, the two largest in the state, were named for the American Indian tribe that lived in the area prior to European settlement in the 18th century. Under pressure from the Iroquois, most of the Conoy/Kanawha had migrated to present-day Virginia by 1634, where they had settled on the west side of the Chesapeake Bay and below the Potomac River. They were also known to the colonists there as the Piscataway. They later migrated north to Pennsylvania, to submit and seek protection with the Susquehannock and Iroquois. The spelling of the Indian tribe varied at the time, from &quot;Conoys&quot; to &quot;Conois&quot; to &quot;Kanawha&quot;. The latter spelling was used and has gained acceptance over time.

<doc id="610631" wikidata="Q1751574" url="?curid=610631" title="Refinancing">
<text>Refinancing is the replacement of an existing debt obligation with another debt obligation under a different term and interest rate. The terms and conditions of refinancing may vary widely by country, province, or state, based on several economic factors such as inherent risk, projected risk, political stability of a nation, currency stability, banking regulations, borrower&#x27;s credit worthiness, and credit rating of a nation. In many industrialized nations, common forms of refinancing include primary residence mortgages and car loans.

If the replacement of debt occurs under financial distress, refinancing might be referred to as debt restructuring.

A loan (debt) might be refinanced for various reasons:

#To take advantage of a better interest rate (a reduced monthly payment or a reduced term)
#To consolidate other debt into one loan (a potentially longer/shorter term contingent on interest rate differential and fees)
#To reduce the monthly repayment amount (often for a longer term, contingent on interest rate differential and fees)
#To reduce or alter risk (for example, switching from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate loan)
#To free up cash (often for a longer term, contingent on interest rate differential and fees)

Refinancing for reasons 2, 3, and 5 are usually undertaken by borrowers who are in financial difficulty in order to reduce their monthly repayment obligations, with the penalty that they will take longer to pay off their debt.

In the context of personal (as opposed to corporate) finance, refinancing multiple debts makes management of the debt easier. If high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, is consolidated into the home mortgage, the borrower is able to pay off the remaining debt at mortgage rates over a longer period.

For home mortgages in the United States, there may be tax advantages available with refinancing, particularly if one does not pay alternative minimum tax.

== Risks ==
Some fixed-term loans have penalty clauses (&quot;call provisions&quot;) that are triggered by an early repayment of the loan, in part or in full, as well as &quot;closing&quot; fees. There will also be transaction fees on the refinancing. These fees must be calculated before embarking on a loan refinancing, as they can wipe out any savings generated through refinancing. Penalty clauses are only applicable to loans paid off prior to maturity. If a loan is paid off upon maturity it is a new financing, not a refinancing, and all terms of the prior obligation terminate when the new financing funds pay off the prior debt.

If the refinanced loan has the same interest rate as previously, but a longer term, it will result in a larger total interest cost over the life of the loan, and will result in the borrower remaining in debt for many more years. Typically, a refinanced loan will have a lower interest rate. This lower rate, combined with the new, longer term remaining on the loan, will lower payments.

A borrower should calculate the total cost of a new loan compared to the existing loan. The new loan cost will include the closing costs, prepayment penalties (if any) and the interest paid over the life of the new loan. This should be lower than the remaining interest that will be paid on the existing loan to see if it makes financial sense to refinance.

In some American jurisdictions, varying by American state, refinanced mortgage loans are considered recourse debt, meaning that the borrower is liable in case of default, while un-refinanced mortgages are non-recourse debt.

== Points ==

Refinancing lenders often require a percentage of the total loan amount as an upfront payment. Typically, this amount is expressed in &quot;points&quot; (or &quot;premiums&quot;) in the United States. 1 point = 1% of the total loan amount. More points (i.e. a larger upfront payment) will usually result in a lower interest rate. Some lenders will offer to finance parts of the loan themselves, thus generating so-called &quot;negative points&quot; (i.e. discounts).

==Types (US loans only)==
=== Types of loan refinancing ===
Refinancing can apply to the debt created by several types of loans. They include mortgages, auto loans, student loans, credit card balances, personal loans, and other similar types of debt obligations.

==== Mortgage refinancing ====
Mortgage refinancing is normally based around the objectives of homeowners and often relates to residential housing loans. The specific types of mortgage refinancing include rate-and-term, cash-out, cash-in, no-closing-cost, and streamline. Rate-and-term refinancing is what most people think of when it comes to mortgage refinancing. It includes replacing your original mortgage with a new one, without significant change in the unpaid principal balance. Cash-out refinancing enables homeowners to extract cash out of their home equity value, resulting in an increase in the unpaid principal balance. Cash-in refinancing allows homeowners to pay into their mortgage, resulting in a decrease in the unpaid principal balance to work towards the goal of gaining a better interest rate or lowering monthly payments. No-closing-cost refinancing helps homeowners avoid paying closing costs at closing by adding the closing cost to the unpaid-principal balance and amortizing it over the term of the loan. Streamlined refinancing helps homeowners skip steps in the refinance process such as appraisals and credit history checks but normally is only available for government-backed mortgages.

Refinancing is a major reason for mortgage prepayment, which can reduce the realized returns on mortgage-backed securities.

==== Auto loan refinancing ====
Auto loan refinancing is a way vehicle owners can change the debt obligations attached to their vehicles. The auto loan refinance process is similar to mortgage refinancing where the new debt obligation comes with a new term and interest rate. Cash-out refinancing can also apply to car loans if vehicle owners need to use portions of their vehicle equity whereas lease buy-out facility to keep vehicle in possession. Vehicle owners should understand the risks and implications of extending term lengths before refinancing.

=== No closing cost ===

Borrowers with this type of refinancing typically pay few if any upfront fees to get the new mortgage loan. This type of refinance can be beneficial, provided the prevailing market rate is lower than the borrower&#x27;s existing rate by a formula determined by the lender offering the loan. The appraisal fee cannot be paid for by the lender or broker so this will always show up in the total settlement charges at the bottom of your good faith estimate (GFE).

This can be an excellent choice in a declining market or if you are not sure you will hold the loan long enough to recoup the closing cost before you refinance or pay it off. For example, you plan on selling your home in three years, but it will take five years to recoup the closing cost. This could prevent you from considering a refinance, however if you take the zero closing cost option, you can lower your interest rate without taking any risk of losing money.

In this case the broker receives a credit or what&#x27;s called yield spread premium (YSP). Yield spread premiums are the cash that a mortgage company receives for originating your loan. The broker provides the client and the documentation needed to process the loan and the lender pays them for providing this service in lieu of paying one of their own loan officers. Since a brokerage can have more than one loan officer originating loans, they can sometimes receive additional YSP for bringing in a larger volume of loans. This is normally based on funding more than 1 million in total loans per month. This can greatly benefit the borrower, especially since April 1, 2011. New laws have been implemented by the federal government mandating that all brokers have set pricing with the lenders they do business with. Brokers can receive so much YSP that they can provide you with a lower rate than if you went directly to the lender and they can pay for all your closing costs as opposed to the lender who would make you pay for all the third party fees on your own. You end up with a lower rate and lower fees. Since the new RESPA law as of April came into effect in 2011, brokers can no longer decide how much they want to make off of the loan. Instead they sign a contract in April stating that they will keep only a certain percentage of the YSP and the rest will go toward the borrower&#x27;s closing cost.

True No Closing Cost mortgages are usually not the best options for people who know that they will keep that loan for the entire length of the term or at least enough time to recoup the closing cost. When the borrower pays out of pocket for their closing costs, they are at a higher risk of losing the money they invested. In most cases, the borrower is not able to negotiate the fees for the appraisal or escrow. Sometimes, when wrapping closing costs into a loan you can easily determine whether it makes sense to go with the lower rate with closing cost or the slightly higher rate for free. Some cases your payment will be the same, in that case you would want to choose the higher rate with no fees. If the payment for 4.5% with $2,500 in settlement charges is the same for 4.625% for free then you will pay the same amount of money over the length of the loan, however if you choose the loan with closing cost and you refinance before the end of your term you wasted money on the closing cost. Your loan amount will be 2,500 less at 4.625% and your payment is the same.

=== No appraisal required ===

The Obama administration authorized several refinance programs aimed at helping underwater homeowners take advantage of the historically low interest rates. Most of these programs do not require an appraisal, and encompass all loan types. The programs offered in 2013 include:
# FHA Streamline Refinance: The largest group that benefits from this refinance program will be those who have a FHA loan that was endorsed prior to May 31, 2009. For those who meet this date, the FHA PMI rates are very very low. This Streamline Refinance Program without an appraisal is also available to borrowers who no longer live in the property (as their primary residence) or own the house as Investment Property.
# VA Loan Refinance: The Veterans Administration offers Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing, or IRRR, for veteran homeowners who simply want to reduce their interest rate, with no appraisal. These loans are also available to qualifying veterans who no longer live in the property as their primary residence.
# HARP Refinance: When the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) was launched in 2009, it sought to help homeowners with underwater mortgages refinance their loans into lower monthly payments and interest rates. However, the first version of the program failed to help as many homeowners with underwater mortgages as was hoped, leading to the release of a new and improved version of HARP, dubbed HARP 2, to deal with the complications. HARP 2 no longer caps the loan-to value at 125%, and allows any loan-to-value acceptable, thereby covering underwater homes. 
#USDA Home Loans: No appraisal required – the current residence must be in a USDA &quot;footprint area&quot; and currently be insured under the USDA program. So refinancing from a conventional loan or a FHA loan to USDA will not work under this program. No Credit Report Required – the current mortgage must be current, and all of the previous 12 months of mortgage payments need to be made on time. That&#x27;s all. We just verify that you made your house payments on time. Employment Verification Required – we will need to verify that you are employed, and drawing enough money to meet the underwriting guidelines... meaning we must prove that you have enough income to make your house payments. Cannot take cash out – All you can do is finance your current loan balance, and the new Guarantee Fee (USDA PMI) which is 1.5%.

=== Cash-out ===

This type of refinance may not help lower the monthly payment or shorten mortgage periods. It can be used for home improvement, credit cards, and other debt consolidation if the borrower qualifies with their current home equity; they can refinance with a loan amount larger than their current mortgage and keep the cash out.

In situations where the borrower has both a first and second mortgage, it is common to consolidate these loans as part of the refinance process. However, even if the borrower does not receive any net &quot;cash out&quot; as part of the transaction, in some cases lenders will consider this a cash-out transaction because of the &quot;12-month rule&quot;. This rule states that any refinance that occurs within 12 months of a second mortgage (that was not part of the original purchase transaction) is considered a cash-out refinance.

<text>Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment (founded and formerly known as Videocraft International, Ltd. and Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc.) was an American production company located in New York City. It was known for its seasonal television specials, usually done in stop motion animation. Rankin/Bass&#x27;s stop-motion productions are recognizable by their visual style of doll-like characters with spheroid body parts and ubiquitous powdery snow using an animation technique called Animagic.

Nearly all of the studio&#x27;s animation was outsourced to Japanese animation companies such as Toei Animation, MOM Production, Mushi Productions and Topcraft. Rankin/Bass was one of the first western studios to outsource their low-budget animated television and film productions to animation studios in foreign countries; the others that already practiced animation outsourcing include Total Television and King Features Syndicate TV in New York City; and Hanna-Barbera and Jay Ward Productions in Los Angeles, California.

== History ==
The company was founded in New York City by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass on September 14, 1960, as Videocraft International, Ltd. The majority of Rankin/Bass&#x27; work, including all of their &quot;Animagic&quot; stop-motion productions (which they were well known for), were created in Tokyo, Japan. Throughout the 1960s, the Animagic productions were headed by Japanese stop-motion animator Tadahito Mochinaga at his studio, MOM Production. He was credited for his supervision as &quot;Tad Mochinaga&quot;.

Rankin/Bass&#x27; traditional animation output was done by several animation studios such as Toei Animation, Eiken (formerly known as TCJ), Dentsu, Mushi Production, and especially Topcraft, which was formed on February 1, 1972, by Toei animator Toru Hara (who was credited as an animation supervisor in some of Rankin/Bass&#x27; specials). While several of Topcraft&#x27;s staff, including Hara and industry legends such as Hayao Miyazaki, would go on to form Studio Ghibli in the wake of Topcraft&#x27;s closure, others formed another studio: Pacific Animation Corporation, which continued working on Rankin/Bass&#x27; titles until it was bought by Disney in 1988.

In addition to the &quot;name&quot; talent that provided the narration for the specials, Rankin/Bass had its own company of voice actors. For the studio&#x27;s early work, this group was based in Toronto, Ontario where recording was supervised by veteran CBC announcer Bernard Cowan. The Canadian group included actors such as Paul Soles, Larry D. Mann, Billie Mae Richards and Carl Banas.

Maury Laws served as musical director for almost all of the animated films and television programs. Romeo Muller was another consistent contributor, serving as screenwriter for many of Rankin/Bass&#x27; best-known productions including &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; (1964), &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; (1968), and &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; (1969).

=== Output ===
One of Videocraft&#x27;s first projects was an independently produced television series in 1960, &quot;The New Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, based on the Italian author Carlo Collodi&#x27;s 1883 novel &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; and featuring &quot;Animagic&quot;, a stop motion animation process using figurines or puppets (a process already pioneered by George Pal&#x27;s &quot;Puppetoons&quot; and Art Clokey&#x27;s &quot;Gumby&quot; and &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot;), managed by Mochinaga and his MOM Production staffers for Videocraft with Dentsu. This was followed by another independently produced series in 1961, &quot;Tales of the Wizard of Oz&quot;, Videocraft&#x27;s adaptation of the 1900 novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; by L. Frank Baum, as well as their first production to use traditional cel animation. Unlike many of Rankin/Bass&#x27; works, &quot;Tales of the Wizard of Oz&quot; was animated by Crawley Films in Ottawa, headed by F. R. Crawley.

==== &quot;Rudolph&quot; era ====

One of the mainstays of the business was holiday-themed animated specials for airing on American television. In 1964, the company produced a special for NBC and sponsor General Electric, later owner of NBC. It was a stop motion animated adaptation of Robert L. May&#x27;s 1939 story &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; and the 1949 song it inspired, &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, written by May&#x27;s brother-in-law, Johnny Marks. Almost two decades earlier, in 1948, it had been made into a cartoon by Max Fleischer, brother and former partner of Dave Fleischer, as a traditional cel animated short for the Jam Handy Film Company.

With the American actor Burl Ives in the role of Sam the snowman, the narrator, Canadian actress Billie Mae Richards as the voice of the main title character, Rudolph, and an original orchestral score composed by Marks himself, &quot;Rudolph&quot; became one of the most popular, and longest-running Christmas specials in television history: it remained with NBC until around 1972 when it moved to CBS. In 2019, for its 55th anniversary, the special was also aired on Freeform as part of its &quot;25 Days of Christmas&quot; programming block, although it continued to air on CBS under a separate license with Universal, but in 2024, it came back to NBC for its 60th anniversary.

The special contained seven original songs. In 1965, a new song was filmed in &quot;Animagic&quot; to replace &quot;We&#x27;re a Couple of Misfits&quot;, titled &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot;.

The success of &quot;Rudolph&quot; led to numerous other Christmas specials. The first was &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; in 1967, with two live-action announcements by Danny Thomas, continuity and character designs by Don Duga and Paul Coker, and animation by Jiro Yanase&#x27;s TCJ, followed by the 1968 Thanksgiving special &quot;The Mouse on the Mayflower&quot;, told by Tennessee Ernie Ford and animated by Kenzo Masaoka, Sanae Yamamoto, and Yasuji Murata&#x27;s Toei Animation. Paul Coker Jr. would go on to design characters and production for more than 40 Rankin-Bass specials and episodes.

==== Other holiday specials ====
Many of their other specials, like &quot;Rudolph&quot;, were based on popular Christmas songs. In 1968, the British-American actress Greer Garson provided dramatic narration for &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;, based on the traditional song and set during the birth of the baby Jesus Christ, and starring the Puerto Rican actor José Ferrer as the voice of Ben Haramed. During that year, Videocraft International, Ltd. (whose logo dominated the Rankin/Bass logo in the closing credit sequences) changed its name to Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc., and adopted a new logo, retaining a Videocraft byline in their closing credits until 1971 when Tomorrow Entertainment, a unit of the General Electric Company, acquired the production company. The &quot;Animagic&quot; process for &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; took place at MOM Production, which was renamed Video Tokyo Production after Tadahito Mochinaga left Japan for his return trip to China following the completion of the animation for &quot;Mad Monster Party?&quot;, thus ending his collaboration with Rankin/Bass. Takeo Nakamura, the director of Sanrio&#x27;s 1979 stop motion feature &quot;Nutcracker Fantasy&quot;, was among the &quot;Animagic&quot; team, but he was never credited as a supervisor.

The following year, in 1969, Jimmy Durante sang and told the story of &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, with Jackie Vernon voicing Frosty. It was based on Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins&#x27; 1950 song of the same name, and also introduced Billy De Wolfe as the voice of Professor Hinkle, a greedy magician who tries to steal away the magic hat that brought Frosty to life to become a billionaire. Mushi Production, an animation studio founded in 1961 and formerly led by the manga artist Osamu Tezuka (creator of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot; and &quot;Ambassador Magma&quot;), handled the animation for the special with supervision by Yusaku &quot;Steve&quot; Nakagawa, a layout artist and character designer from Hanna-Barbera Productions in Los Angeles, California.

The year 1970 brought another Christmas special, &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;. Rankin/Bass enlisted Fred Astaire as narrator S.D. (Special Delivery) Kluger, a mailman answering children&#x27;s questions about Santa Claus and telling his origin story. The story involved young Kris Kringle, voiced by Mickey Rooney, and the villainous Burgermeister Meisterburger, voiced by Paul Frees. Kringle later marries the town&#x27;s schoolteacher, Miss Jessica, voiced by Robie Lester. Kizo Nagashima, the associate director of Rankin/Bass&#x27; previous productions, was credited as a production supervisor.

In 1971, Rankin/Bass produced their first Easter television special, &quot;Here Comes Peter Cottontail&quot;, with the voices of Danny Kaye as the narrator Seymour S. Sassafrass, Vincent Price as the evil rabbit January Q. Irontail, and Casey Kasem from Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise as the title character Peter Cottontail. It was not based upon the title song by Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins, but on a 1957 novel by Priscilla and Otto Friedrich titled &quot;The Easter Bunny That Overslept&quot;. This was the second and final &quot;Animagic&quot; production to be supervised by Kizo Nagashima. Steve Nakagawa was also involved in this special as a continuity designer. In 1977, Fred Astaire returned as S. D. Kluger in &quot;The Easter Bunny Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;, telling the tale of the Easter Bunny&#x27;s origins. From there, Rankin/Bass used Masaki Iizuka as an associate producer, and Akikazu Kono as an &quot;Animagic&quot; supervisor. Back in 1973, Iizuka was the production assistant of &quot;Marco&quot;—a live-action musical film based on the biography of Italian merchant, explorer, and writer Marco Polo, filmed at Toho Company in Tokyo and on location throughout East Asia, and featuring Kono&#x27;s &quot;Animagic&quot; sequence of the Tree People. Previously, he was met by Rankin during the animation production of the Halloween television special &quot;Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters&quot; at Mushi Production in 1972, and became an integral part of Rankin/Bass for many years.

In 1974, Rankin/Bass Productions was relaunched once again as an independent production company and produced another Christmas special for television, &quot;The Year Without a Santa Claus&quot;, featuring Shirley Booth, voicing narrator Mrs. Claus; Mickey Rooney, returning as the voice of Santa Claus; and supporting characters Snow Miser (voiced by Dick Shawn) and Heat Miser (voiced by George S. Irving). It was the first Rankin/Bass &quot;Animagic&quot; production on which Akikazu Kono and puppet maker Ichiro Komuro share in the production supervision. It was remade as a poorly received live-action/special effects TV movie shown on NBC in 2006 starring Delta Burke and John Goodman as Mrs. Claus and Santa.

Throughout the 1970s, Rankin/Bass, with Video Tokyo and the former Toei Animation employee Toru Hara&#x27;s Topcraft, continued to produce animated sequels to its classic specials, including the teaming of Rudolph and Frosty in 1979&#x27;s &quot;Rudolph and Frosty&#x27;s Christmas in July,&quot; with the voice of Ethel Merman as Lilly Loraine, the ringmistress of a seaside circus, and Rooney again returning as Santa. The special features cameos by characters from several other Rankin/Bass holiday specials, including Big Ben the Clockwork Whale from &quot;Rudolph&#x27;s Shiny New Year&quot; and Jack Frost from &quot;Frosty&#x27;s Winter Wonderland&quot;. Later that year, Jack appeared in his own special, &quot;Jack Frost&quot;. Narrated by Buddy Hackett, it tells the story of the winter sprite&#x27;s love for a mortal woman menaced by the evil Cossack king, Kubla Kraus (Paul Frees, in addition to Kubla, voiced Jack Frost&#x27;s overlord, Father Winter). In this special, Jack&#x27;s voice was performed by Robert Morse, who previously voiced Stuffy in 1976&#x27;s &quot;The First Easter Rabbit&quot; (loosely based on Margery Williams&#x27; &quot;The Velveteen Rabbit&quot;), and young Ebenezer Scrooge in 1978&#x27;s &quot;The Stingiest Man in Town&quot; (based on Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;).

Among Rankin/Bass&#x27; original specials was 1975&#x27;s &quot;The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow&quot;, featuring the voice of Angela Lansbury (who also starred in the 1982 adaptation of &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;) as the narrating and singing nun, Sister Theresa, and Irving Berlin&#x27;s Christmas classic &quot;White Christmas&quot;.

Their final stop-motion style Christmas story was &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot;, taken from the L. Frank Baum story of the same name and released in 1985. In this story, the Great Ak (voiced by Alfred Drake) summons a council of the Immortals to bestow upon a dying Claus (voiced by Earl Hammond, with J.D. Roth voicing the young Claus) the Mantle of Immortality. To make his case, the Great Ak tells Claus&#x27;s life story, from his discovery as a foundling in the magical forest and his raising by Immortals, through his education by the Great Ak in the harsh realities of the human world, and his acceptance of his destiny to struggle to bring joy to children. This special has recently been released as part of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment&#x27;s Warner Archive Collection, on a double-feature disc that also contains &quot;Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey&quot; which is often paired with &quot;The First Christmas&quot; on holiday broadcasts.

Many of these specials are still shown seasonally on American television, and some have been released on VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, DVD, Blu-ray, and Digital.

==== Non-holiday output ====
Throughout the 1960s, Videocraft produced other stop motion and traditional animation specials and films, some of which were non-holiday stories. 1965 saw the production of Rankin/Bass&#x27; first theatrical film, &quot;Willy McBean and His Magic Machine&quot;, another joint venture between Videocraft and Dentsu. 1966 brought &quot;The Daydreamer&quot;, the first of three films to be produced in association with executive producer Joseph E. Levine&#x27;s Embassy Pictures in Los Angeles, California, and the film adaptation of the stories and characters by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, which combines live-action, special effects and &quot;Animagic&quot;; and &quot;The Ballad of Smokey the Bear&quot;, the story of the famous forest fire-fighting bear seen in numerous public service announcements, narrated by James Cagney.

The theatrical feature film &quot;Mad Monster Party?&quot; saw theatrical release in the spring of 1967, featuring one of the last performances by the British actor Boris Karloff. The film features affectionate send-ups of classic movie monsters and their locales, adding &quot;Beatle&quot;-wigged skeletons as a send-up of the era&#x27;s pop bands, and a writing staff borrowed from &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, including the cartoonist Jack Davis, who designed the characters of this film. It is also the last &quot;Animagic&quot; project that Tadahito Mochinaga supervised.

In 1972 and 1973, Rankin/Bass produced four animated TV movies for &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot; series: &quot;Mad Mad Mad Monsters&quot; (with the animation by Mushi), &quot;Willie Mays and the Say-Hey Kid&quot;, &quot;The Red Baron&quot;, and &quot;That Girl in Wonderland&quot; (all featuring the animation by Topcraft).

In 1977, Rankin/Bass produced an animated version of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. It was followed in 1980 by an animated version of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (the animation rights to the first two volumes were held by Saul Zaentz, producer of Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s animated adaptation &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;). Other books adapted include &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; by Peter S. Beagle, a rare theatrical release that was co-produced with ITC Entertainment in London, England, Peter Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;The Flight of Dragons&quot; and Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; which was animated by the second overseas animation unit of Hanna-Barbera, James Wang&#x27;s Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest Studios (now Wang Film Productions) in Taipei, Taiwan.

In addition to their prime time specials, Rankin/Bass produced several regular television shows in traditional animation, including &quot;The King Kong Show&quot; (1966),&quot;The Smokey Bear Show&quot; (1969), animated by Toei Animation, &quot;The Reluctant Dragon &amp; Mr. Toad Show&quot; (1970), animated by Mushi Production, &quot;The Tomfoolery Show&quot; (1970) animated by Halas and Batchelor Animation, Ltd., &quot;The Jackson 5ive&quot; in 1971 (the latter co-produced with Motown Productions), and &quot;Kid Power&quot; and &quot;The Osmonds&quot; in 1972. The most successful of these was Ted Wolf&#x27;s &quot;ThunderCats&quot; in 1985, an action-adventure series based on his related line of toys. It was followed by two similar TV shows about humanoid animals, &quot;SilverHawks&quot; in 1986, and &quot;TigerSharks&quot;, as part of the series &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; in 1987. Each of those four series was mainly animated by former Topcraft employees&#x27; Pacific Animation Corporation, with production management by Masaki Iizuka, just before the studio was bought by Disney and renamed Walt Disney Animation Japan in 1988. Neither one enjoyed the same commercial success as &quot;ThunderCats&quot; did, however.

Rankin/Bass also attempted live-action productions, such as 1967&#x27;s &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;, a co-production with Toho; 1976&#x27;s &quot;The Last Dinosaur&quot;; 1978&#x27;s &quot;The Bermuda Depths&quot;; 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Ivory Ape&quot; (all co-produced with Tsuburaya Productions, the creators of the &quot;Ultra Series&quot;); and 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Sins of Dorian Gray&quot;. With the exception of &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;, all were made-for-television films.

=== Demise ===
The studio closed in 1987 as a result of TV show failures like &quot;The Comic Strip&quot;, and its partnership was officially dissolved in 2001 after the production of the studio&#x27;s last Christmas special &quot;Santa, Baby!&quot;.

Arthur Rankin Jr. would split his time between New York City, where the company still had its offices, and his home in Bermuda. Rankin died at Harrington Sound, Bermuda on January 30, 2014, at the age of 89. Bass became a vegetarian; a decade later, he wrote &quot;Herb, the Vegetarian Dragon&quot;, the first children&#x27;s book character developed specifically to explore moral issues related to vegetarianism. The original story and a follow-up cookbook became bestsellers for independent publishing house Barefoot Books. Bass died on October 25, 2022, at the age of 87.

In 1999, Rankin/Bass joined forces with James G. Robinson&#x27;s Morgan Creek Productions and Nest Family Entertainment (creators of &quot;The Swan Princess&quot; franchise) for the first and only animated adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s musical &quot;The King and I&quot;, based on a treatment by Rankin. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures with its Warner Bros. Family Entertainment division, the film flopped at the American box office. Stephen Hunter, among several American film critics, criticized the film&#x27;s depictions of &quot;offensive ethnic stereotyping.&quot;

In 2001, Fox aired the first new original Christmas special to be produced by both Rankin and Bass in 16 years, &quot;Santa, Baby!&quot;, which like most of their production company&#x27;s other specials was based on a popular, similarly-titled Christmas song. &quot;Santa, Baby!&quot; stood out from its predecessors due to its use of African-American characters and voice performers, such as Patti LaBelle (the narrator), Eartha Kitt, Gregory Hines, Vanessa L. Williams and Tom Joyner. Although Pacific Animation Corporation was responsible for the overseas animation production of the special with the background art provided by Atelier BWCA and the See Throu Studio, some of the animation services were done at Steven Hahn&#x27;s Hanho Heung-Up in Seoul, South Korea. &quot;Santa, Baby!&quot; turned out to be the final Rankin/Bass-produced special; the Rankin/Bass partnership was officially dissolved shortly after, with most of its remaining assets acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment.

Currently, Rankin/Bass&#x27; pre-September 1974 library (including works from Videocraft International) is owned by Universal Pictures, which acquired DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s DreamWorks Classics portfolio, while Warner Bros. Discovery owns the rights to the post-September 1974 library. Universal also retained the rights to &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot; and also currently holds the rights to &quot;Willy McBean and his Magic Machine&quot;, again, via DreamWorks Classics. StudioCanal holds the rights to the films from Rankin/Bass that Embassy Pictures distributed, with U.S. distribution rights split between Rialto Pictures and Lionsgate (excluding &quot;The Daydreamer&quot;, the U.S. distribution rights to which are with Scorpion Releasing) while ITV Studios currently holds the rights to &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;, with select distribution rights currently licensed to Shout! Studios. The rights to the 1999 animated film adaptation of &quot;The King and I&quot; are currently held by Morgan Creek Entertainment, with distribution handled by Revolution Studios.

==Legacy==
For over 20 years, most of Rankin/Bass&#x27; films were shown on Family Channel, Fox Family, ABC Family, and Freeform, during the &quot;25 Days of Christmas&quot; seasonal period. Starting in 2018, the post-September 1974 specials moved to AMC, and aired during the &quot;Best Christmas Ever&quot; seasonal period, with Freeform retaining the pre-September 1974 specials&#x27; cable rights. The original &quot;Rudolph&quot; and &quot;Frosty&quot; specials currently air on NBC, the sister company of the pre-September 1974 specials&#x27; owner, DreamWorks Classics, with &quot;Santa&quot; airing on ABC.

The specials of Rankin/Bass have been parodied by the likes of TV series from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to &quot;South Park&quot;, while non-holiday works like &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; maintained a cult following. The look and style of the Christmas specials heavily influences more modern holiday classics such as &quot;Elf&quot; (2003).

Beginning in 2013, and for several years thereafter, the animation studio ShadowMachine was hired by the SoCal Honda Dealers group (via Secret Weapon Marketing) to create stop-motion animated commercials in the style of Rankin/Bass&#x27;s Christmas specials.

RiffTrax, consisted of former &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; alumni Kevin Murphy, Bill Corbett and Michael J. Nelson, spoofed &quot;Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey&quot; on December 17, 2006 (this time with just Nelson himself riffing).

In 2022, an agreement between Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal (which co-own Studio Distribution Services, LLC) was made to release &quot;The Complete Rankin-Bass Christmas Collection&quot; as a nine-disc DVD box set with a 24-page booklet and special features. (Universal Pictures Home Entertainment is the publisher of record for the set.) The box set features eighteen specials, comprising every stand-alone, Rankin-Bass produced Christmas special aside from &quot;Santa, Baby!&quot; A Blu-ray version of the set was released in 2023.

<text>The Boomer Bible is a book written by R. F. Laird. In structure, the book is based on the Christian Bible, but it is neither a simple parody of the Bible nor is it sacrilegious specifically toward the Bible or Christianity. Laird described the book as expressing the things people truly believe as opposed to what they say they believe. 

== Structure ==
The core of the &quot;Boomer Bible&quot; consists of The Past Testament and The Present Testament, which correspond roughly to the Old and New Testaments.

The Past Testament contains a comprehensive view of science, history, philosophy, morality, and literature as understood by the Baby Boomers from pop culture and an ineffective educational system:

* The Books of Apes (Kinesis, Apes, Names, Gods, and Lies) which describe prehistory.
* The Books of peoples (Gypsies, Mesopotamians, Greeks, Romans, Barbarians, Christians, Bubonites, Giants, Explorers, Spics, Frogs, Brits, Krauts, Yanks, Beaks, Russkies, Chinks, Nips, and Others) which describe the history of various peoples of the Earth.
* The &quot;PS&quot; books (Psongs, Psayings, Psomethings, Pnotes, and Pspeciasties) which contain everything from the prayers of a Gatsby-like character for money, to poorly remembered snippets of literature, to numerology worthy of Nostradamus
* The Books of the VIPs (Adam, Chuck, Carl, Ziggie, Dave, Al, Paul, Frankie and Johnny, Ed, and Jeffrey) which describe various famous pioneers in the Western canon and what became of their efforts.

The Present Testament concerns the life of Harry, a kind of cynical Jesus spreading &quot;Consolation&quot; in the form of cocaine, with Philadelphia substituting for the Holy Lands:
* Four &quot;gospels,&quot; (Willie, Vinnie, Ned, and Ira), the first three synoptic.
* The Book of Exploits, roughly equivalent to Acts
* The Letters to the peoples of Philadelphia (Hillites, Annenburghers, Jeffersonians, Kensingtonians, Swarthmorons, Hallites, Drexelites, Boulevardiers, Pennsylvanians, Forgers, Wharts, Mawrites, Centralian, Mallites, Mainliners, and Broadstreeters), each adopting the rhetorical style, tone, or vernacular of the corresponding constituencies
* The Book of Rationalizations, roughly equivalent to Revelation, dictated by Harry&#x27;s father, Dave

After this is &quot;The Book of Harrier Brayer&quot; and &quot;The Harrier Hymnal&quot;, which correspond roughly to &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and hymns.

These books were written by a community of Punk writers during the 1970s. Surrounding them are A Punk Testament and an Epistle Dedicatory, which describes a history of and the motivation for the writing of the book. Passages in the Testaments are linked via an intercolumn reference (ICR). This may be the most important feature of the book and allows the book to be read as hypertext. There are hidden messages and puzzles in the ICR which serve as enticements to see the book in a different way, most often through in-jokes and occasional circular references.

Surrounding this are two prefaces. The Second Preface describes the quest of a former writer of UFO books to discover a true manuscript of &quot;The Boomer Bible&quot;. The First Preface is a rather scathing review of the book.

Apocryphally the incidents referenced in the &quot;Punk Testament&quot; are not about punk rockers, but about the events surrounding the 1985 firebombing of the MOVE house in West Philadelphia.

<text>In the United Kingdom, life peers are appointed members of the peerage whose titles cannot be inherited, in contrast to hereditary peers. Life peers are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister. With the exception of the Dukedom of Edinburgh awarded for life to Prince Edward in 2023, all life peerages conferred since 2009 have been created under the Life Peerages Act 1958 with the rank of baron, and entitle their holders to sit and vote in the House of Lords so long as they meet qualifications such as age and citizenship. The legitimate children of a life peer appointed under the Life Peerages Act 1958 are entitled to style themselves with the prefix &quot;The Honourable&quot;, although they cannot inherit the peerage. Prior to 2009, life peers of baronial rank could also be created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 for senior judges, referred to as Law Lords, with functions then taken over by the new Supreme Court.

==Before 1887==
The Crown, as &quot;fount of honour&quot;, creates peerages of two types, being hereditary or for life. In the early days of the peerage, the sovereign had the right to summon individuals to one Parliament without being bound to summon them again. Over time, it was established that once summoned, a peer would have to be summoned for the remainder of their life, and later, that the peer&#x27;s heirs and successors would also be summoned, thereby firmly entrenching the hereditary principle.

Nevertheless, life peerages lingered. From the reign of James I to that of George II (between 1603 and 1760), 18 life peerages were created for women. Women, however, were excluded from sitting in the House of Lords, so it was unclear whether or not a life peerage would entitle a man to do the same. For over four centuries—if one excludes those who sat in Cromwell&#x27;s House of Lords (or Other House) during the Interregnum—no man had claimed a seat in the Lords by virtue of a life peerage. In 1856, it was thought necessary to add a peer learned in law to the House of Lords (which was the final court of appeal), without allowing the peer&#x27;s heirs to sit in the House and swell its numbers. Sir James Parke, a Baron (judge) of the Exchequer, was created Baron Wensleydale for life, but the House of Lords concluded that the peerage did not entitle him to sit in the House of Lords. Lord Wensleydale was therefore appointed a hereditary peer (in the event, he had no sons, so his peerage did not pass to an heir) &quot;(See also Wensleydale Peerage Case (1856))&quot;.

The Government introduced a bill to authorise the creation of two life peerages carrying seats in the House of Lords for judges who had held office for at least five years. The House of Lords passed it, but the bill was lost in the House of Commons.

In 1869, a more comprehensive life peerages bill was brought forward by the Earl Russell. At any one time, 28 life peerages could be in existence; no more than four were to be created in any one year. Life peers were to be chosen from senior judges, civil servants, senior officers of the British Army or Royal Navy, members of the House of Commons who had served for at least ten years, scientists, writers, artists, peers of Scotland, and peers of Ireland. (Peers of Scotland and Ireland did not all have seats in the House of Lords, instead electing a number of representative peers.) The bill was rejected by the House of Lords at its third reading.

The Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 permitted the creation of life peerages with the rank of baron for senior judges in the House of Lords. Initially it was intended that the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary created in this way (for their titles, see the list of law life peerages) would only sit in the House of Lords while serving their term as judges, but in 1887 (on the retirement of Lord Blackburn, the first person appointed under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876) the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1887 provided that former judges would retain their seats for life. The practice of appointing life peers under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 ended with the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009. Sitting judges of the Supreme Court are not automatically given life peerages but are entitled to use the judicial courtesy title of &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; for life.

==Life Peerages Act 1958==

The Life Peerages Act sanctions the regular granting of life peerages, but the power to appoint Lords of Appeal in Ordinary under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act was not derogated. The Act placed no limits on the number of peerages that the sovereign may award, as was done by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act. A peer created under the Life Peerages Act has the right to sit in the House of Lords, provided that they are at least 21 years of age, are not suffering punishment upon conviction for treason, and are a citizen of the United Kingdom, or of a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, and are a resident in the UK for tax purposes.

Life baronies under the Life Peerages Act are created by the sovereign but, in practice, are only granted when proposed by the Prime Minister.

Life peers created under the Life Peerages Act do not, unless they also hold ministerial positions, receive salaries. They are, however, entitled to an allowance of £300 for travel and accommodation for each day on which the peer &quot;signs in&quot; to the House, though the peer does not have to take part in the business of the House.

===&quot;Working peers&quot;===
From time to time, lists of &quot;working peers&quot; are published. They do not form a formal class, but represent the various political parties and are expected to regularly attend the House of Lords. Most new appointments of life peers fall into this category.

Normally, the Prime Minister chooses only peers from their own party, but permits the leaders of opposition parties to recommend peers from their parties. The Prime Minister may determine the number of peers each party may propose; they may also choose to amend these recommendations, but by convention do not do so.

===&quot;People&#x27;s peers&quot;===
Peers may be created on a &quot;non-partisan basis&quot;. Formerly, nominations on merit alone were made by the Prime Minister, but this function was partially transferred to a new, non-statutory House of Lords Appointments Commission in 2000. Individuals recommended for the peerage by the commission go on to become what have been described by some in the British media as &quot;people&#x27;s peers&quot;. The commission also scrutinises party recommendations for working peerages to ensure propriety. The Prime Minister may determine the number of peers the Commission may propose, and also may amend the recommendations. Again, by convention, no amendment is made to the recommendations of the commission.

===Honours===
Individuals may be created peers in various honours lists as rewards for achievement; these peers are not expected to attend the House of Lords regularly, but are at liberty to do so if they please. The New Year Honours List, the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List (to mark the sovereign&#x27;s official birthday, the third Saturday in June), the Dissolution Honours List (to mark the dissolution of Parliament) and the Resignation Honours List (to mark the end of a Prime Minister&#x27;s tenure) are all used to announce life peerage creations.

===Public offices===
Creations may be made for individuals on retirement from important public offices, such as Prime Minister, Speaker of the House of Commons or Archbishop of Canterbury or York.

Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who had renounced his hereditary title of the 14th Earl of Home on becoming Prime Minister, was the first former occupant of the office to receive a life barony. Harold Wilson, James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher all took life peerages following their retirement from the House of Commons. David Cameron took a life peerage upon his appointment as Foreign Secretary under Rishi Sunak. Theresa May was granted a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours. Edward Heath and John Major chose not to become peers. Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Boris Johnson, and Liz Truss have yet to receive a peerage. , Rishi Sunak is still serving as an MP. 

Harold Macmillan declined a peerage on leaving office, but over 20 years after retiring he accepted a second offer of the customary hereditary earldom for retiring Prime Ministers, as Earl of Stockton (1984); this was the last earldom to be offered outside the royal family. While David Lloyd George also waited a similar period for his earldom, most offers have been made and accepted shortly after retirement such as the Earls of Oxford and Asquith, Baldwin, Attlee and Avon.

Many Cabinet members, including Chancellors of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretaries, Home Secretaries and Defence Secretaries, retiring since 1958 have generally been created life peers. William Whitelaw was created a hereditary viscount on the recommendation of Margaret Thatcher. Viscount Whitelaw died without male issue.

Life peerages have generally been granted to Speakers of the House of Commons upon retirement since 1971, who sit as crossbenchers. (Previously, retiring Speakers had by custom received a hereditary peerage between 1780 and 1970, usually a viscountcy.) George Thomas was the only Speaker after 1971 who still received a hereditary peerage instead of a life peerage, being created Viscount Tonypandy, but he died without male issue. 
The convention was broken in 2020 when retiring Speaker John Bercow was not granted a life peerage, the first denial of a peerage to a former Speaker in over 200 years. At the time, Bercow was under investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards regarding allegations of bullying, with the government claiming that Bercow would fail a &quot;propriety test&quot; conducted for all nominees. Unusually, Bercow was nominated for a peerage by then-Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

The Prime Minister continues to recommend a small number of former public office-holders for peerages. This generally includes Chiefs of Defence Staff, Secretaries of the Cabinet, and Heads of the Diplomatic Service. Every Archbishop of Canterbury who has retired since 1958 has been created a life peer, as have most recent Archbishops of York on retirement. A small number of other bishops—such as David Sheppard of Liverpool and Richard Harries of Oxford—were ennobled on retiring. The Lord Chamberlain is traditionally a member of the House of Lords and so is ennobled on appointment (if not already a peer), while most retiring Private Secretaries to the Sovereign and Governors of the Bank of England have also become peers.

High judicial officers have sometimes been created life peers upon taking office. All Lord Chief Justices of England and Wales have, since 1958, been created life peers under the Life Peerages Act, with the exception of Lord Woolf, who was already a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary before becoming Lord Chief Justice. Similarly, Lord Reed was created a life peer in 2019 when he was appointed President of the Supreme Court, all of his predecessors in that role having already been created life peers as former Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.

Life peerages may in certain cases be awarded to hereditary peers. After the House of Lords Act 1999 passed, several hereditary peers of the first creation, who had not inherited their titles but would still be excluded from the House of Lords by the Act, were created life peers: Toby Low, 1st Baron Aldington; Frederick James Erroll, 1st Baron Erroll of Hale; Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford and 1st Baron Pakenham; and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon. None of the peers of the first creation who were members of the royal family was granted a life peerage, as they had all declined. Life peerages were also granted to former Leaders of the House of Lords, including John Julian Ganzoni, 2nd Baron Belstead; Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington; Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury (better known as Viscount Cranborne and Lord Cecil of Essendon, having attended the Lords by virtue of a writ of acceleration); George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe; Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd; and David Hennessy, 3rd Baron Windlesham.

As part of the celebrations to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Life Peerages Act, Gareth Williams, Baron Williams of Mostyn was voted by the members of the House of Lords at the time as the outstanding life peer since the creation of the life peerage.

==Number of life peers==
As of , there are life peers eligible to vote in the House of Lords. This includes Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, and crossbench peers. There are also others representing 4 other parties, non-affiliated, labelling themselves as &quot;independent&quot; but close to a party, and the Lord Speaker. In addition, there are about 70 life peers who have retired from the House of Lords since 2010, as well as several who have been removed for non-attendance. There are currently life peers who are members but ineligible to sit, either because of temporary suspension, a requested leave of absence, or holding of certain judicial offices.

The Appellate Jurisdiction Act originally provided for the appointment of two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who would continue to serve while holding judicial office, though in 1887, they were permitted to continue to sit in the House of Lords for life, under the style and dignity of baron. The number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was increased from time to time – to three in 1882, to four in 1891, to six in 1913, to seven in 1919, to nine in 1947, to 11 in 1968 and to 12 in 1994. These provisions were repealed by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 which created the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. That Act also provided that holders of judicial offices, including Justice of the Supreme Court, who are for that reason disqualified from the House of Commons or the Northern Ireland Assembly, are now also disqualified from taking up their seats in the House of Lords if they are peers (as the former Law Lords all were).

The rate of creation of life peerages under the Life Peerages Act has been fluctuating, with a high rate being most common right after a new party is elected to government. Consequently, David Cameron and Tony Blair have created life peerages at high rates, at 40.5 and 35.7 peerages per year respectively.

Conservative Prime Ministers have created on average 21 life peers per year in office, Labour Prime Ministers an average of 27 per year. In absolute terms, the Conservatives (in 40 years) have created slightly more (853 out of 1504, as of June 2022) life peerages than Labour (651 in 24 years); in addition, the vast majority (61) of the 68 non-royal &quot;hereditary&quot; peerages created since 1958 were created under Conservative Prime Ministers (especially Macmillan). Only three non-royal hereditary peerages have been created since 1965 (all under Thatcher), and none since 1984.

In 1999, there were 172 Conservative and 160 Labour life peers in the House of Lords, and by 4 January 2010, there were 141 Conservative and 207 Labour life peers in the House of Lords. The hereditary element of the House of Lords, however, was much less balanced. In 1999, for example, immediately before most hereditary peers were removed by the House of Lords Act, there were 350 Conservative hereditary peers, compared with 19 Labour peers and 23 Liberal Democrat peers.

==Disclaiming==
The Peerage Act 1963 allows the holder of a hereditary peerage to disclaim their title for life. There is no such provision for life peers. The Coalition Government&#x27;s draft proposal for Lords reform in 2011 provided &quot;that a person who holds a life peerage may at any time disclaim that peerage by writing to the Lord Chancellor. The person [and their spouse and children] will be divested of all rights and interests attaching to [that] peerage.&quot; This proposal did not become law. In 2014 under the House of Lords Reform Act it became possible for peers to resign from the House of Lords and the next year&#x27;s House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act authorised the Lords to expel a peer (both without disclaiming the peerage).

==Titles and forms of address==

Most barons or baronesses for life take a title based on their surname, either alone (e.g. Baron Hattersley) or in combination with a placename (known as a territorial designation) to differentiate them from others of the same surname (e.g. Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws). Surnames need not be used at all if desired. Ian Paisley, for example, opted for the title &quot;Lord Bannside&quot;, and John Gummer chose the title &quot;Lord Deben&quot;. There are also occasions when someone&#x27;s surname is not appropriate as a title, such as Michael Lord (now &quot;Lord Framlingham&quot;) and Michael Bishop (now &quot;Lord Glendonbrook&quot;).

The formal style for a life peer is as follows (John Smith and Mary Smith refer to any name; London to any territorial designation):

* In the case of a life baron: The Rt Hon The Lord Smith (of London) (e.g. The Rt Hon The Lord Owen)&lt;br&gt;&quot;or&quot; The Rt Hon John, Lord Smith (of London) (e.g. The Rt Hon David, Lord Steel of Aikwood)
* In the case of a life baroness: The Rt Hon The Baroness Smith (of London) (e.g. The Rt Hon The Baroness Thatcher)&lt;br&gt;&quot;or&quot; The Rt Hon Mary, Baroness Smith (of London) (e.g. The Rt Hon Betty, Baroness Boothroyd)

Life peers are often mistakenly called &#x27;Lord&#x27; or &#x27;Lady&#x27; before their names (e.g. &quot;Lord Andrew Lloyd-Webber&quot;) following their ennoblement, but this is incorrect since the correct form should be one of those shown above. Only the daughters of earls, marquesses and dukes (and women members of the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle), and the younger sons of marquesses and dukes are properly referred to by the courtesy title of Lord or Lady Firstname Lastname, e.g. &quot;Lord Louis Mountbatten&quot;, who was referred to as such as the younger son of the Marquess of Milford Haven before his enoblement as the Viscount (later Earl) Mountbatten of Burma.

A different form of modern life peerage was instituted when Prince Edward was made Duke of Edinburgh for life in 2023, with the title to revert to the Crown on the prince&#x27;s death. This ennoblement differs from other life peerages in that it was not made under the 1958 Act, does not give the prince the right to sit in the House of Lords, and gives him a more elevated rank than baron.

<text>John Hookham Frere (21 May 1769 – 7 January 1846) was an English diplomat and author.

==Early life==
Frere was born in London. His father, John Frere, a member of a Suffolk family, had been educated at Caius College, Cambridge, and became Second Wrangler in 1763. His mother, Jane, daughter of John Hookham, a rich London merchant, was cultured and wrote verse in private. His father&#x27;s sister Ellenor, who married Sir John Fenn, editor of the &quot;Paston Letters&quot;, wrote educational works for children under the pseudonyms &quot;Mrs Lovechild&quot; and &quot;Mrs Teachwell&quot;. Young Frere was sent to Eton College in 1785, and there began a friendship with George Canning which greatly affected his life. From Eton, he went to his father&#x27;s college at Cambridge, and graduated BA in 1792 and MA in 1795. He entered public service in the foreign office under Lord Grenville, and sat from 1796 to 1802 as Member of Parliament for the borough of West Looe in Cornwall.

==Career==

From his boyhood he had admired William Pitt the Younger, and along with Canning he entered into the defence of his government, and contributed to the pages of the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot;, edited by Gifford. He contributed, in collaboration with Canning, &quot;The Loves of the Triangles&quot;, a parody of Erasmus Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Loves of the Plants&quot;, &quot;The Needy Knife-Grinder&quot; and &quot;The Rovers&quot;. On Canning&#x27;s promotion to the board of trade in 1809 he succeeded him as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In October 1800, he was appointed envoy to Lisbon; and in September 1802 he was transferred to Madrid, where he remained for two years. He was recalled on account of a personal disagreement he had with Spanish Prime Minister Godoy, but the ministry showed its approval of his action with a pension of £1,700 a year.

Frere was made a member of the Privy Council in 1805. In 1807 he was appointed plenipotentiary at Berlin, but the mission was abandoned, and Frere was sent to Spain in 1808 as plenipotentiary to the Central Junta. The condition of Spain rendered his position difficult. When Napoleon began to advance on Madrid, it became a matter of great importance to decide whether Sir John Moore, who was then in the north of Spain, should occupy the capital or retreat, and if he did retreat whether he should go to Portugal or to Galicia. Frere strongly felt that the bolder was the better course, and he urged his views with an urgent and fearless persistency that on sometimes overstepped the limits of his commission. After the disastrous retreat to A Coruña, the public accused Frere of having endangered the British army; though no direct censure was passed upon his conduct by the government, he was recalled, and Marquess Wellesley was appointed in his place.

This ended Frere&#x27;s public life. He afterwards refused to go to St Petersburg as ambassador, and twice declined a peerage. In 1816, he married Elizabeth Jemima Hay, dowager Countess of Erroll. In 1820, on account of her failing health, he went with her to Malta, where he lived for the rest of his life. In retirement, he devoted himself to literature, studied his favourite Greek authors, and taught himself Hebrew and Maltese. He welcomed English guests, was popular with his Maltese neighbours, and befriended Mikiel Anton Vassalli, the first Professor of Maltese at the University of Malta. He died at Villa Frere in Pietà close to Valletta and is buried at Msida Bastion Cemetery.

In 1833–34, as President of the General Council of the University of Malta, he donated eighty-five volumes of medical books to the Public Library collection with the specific intention of being &quot;for the use of the young students of the medical art&quot;.

==Works==
Frere&#x27;s literary reputation now rests upon his verse translations of Aristophanes. The translations of &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, &quot;The Knights&quot;, &quot;The Birds&quot;, and &quot;The Frogs&quot; were privately printed, and were first brought into general notice by George Cornewall Lewis in the &quot;Classical Museum&quot; for 1847. They were followed by &quot;Theognis Restilutus&quot;, the personal history of the poet Theognis of Megara. In 1817, he published a mock-heroic Arthurian poem, &quot;, by William and Robert Whistlecraft, of Stowmarket in Suffolk, Harness and Collar Makers&quot;. William Tennant in &quot;Anster Fair&quot; used the &quot;ottava rima&quot; for semi-burlesque poetry five years earlier, but Frere&#x27;s experiment is interesting because Byron borrowed it in &quot;Don Juan&quot;.

Frere&#x27;s complete works were published in 1871, with a memoir by his nephews, WE and Sir Henry Bartle Frere.

<text>Credo quia absurdum is a Latin phrase that means &quot;I believe because it is absurd&quot;, originally misattributed to Tertullian in his &quot;De Carne Christi&quot;. It is believed to be a paraphrasing of Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;prorsus credibile est, quia ineptum est&quot; which means &quot;it is completely credible because it is unsuitable&quot;, or &quot;certum est, quia impossibile&quot; which means &quot;it is certain because it is impossible&quot;. Early modern, Protestant and Enlightenment rhetoric against Catholicism and religion more broadly resulted in this phrase being changed to &quot;I believe because it is absurd&quot;, displaced from its original anti-Marcionite context into a personally religious one. Tertullian&#x27;s phrase originated in a rebuttal to Marcion&#x27;s view that a human death for the divine Son of God would be paradoxical and thus ought to be rejected.

== History of the phrase ==

===Origins===

The original phrase, before being transmuted through Enlightenment rhetoric to its modern form &quot;I believe because it is absurd&quot;, appeared in Tertullian&#x27;s work &quot;De Carne Christi&quot; (), read by scholars as &quot;I believe because it is unfitting&quot;. The context is a defense of the tenets of orthodox Christianity against docetism:

The consensus of Tertullian scholars is that the reading &quot;I believe because it is absurd&quot; sharply diverges from Tertullian&#x27;s own thoughts, given the priority placed on reasoned argument and rationality in his writings. In the same work, Tertullian later writes &quot;But here again, I must have some reasons.&quot; Elsewhere, he writes that the new Christian “should believe nothing but that nothing should be rashly believed.” Scholars note further examples of where Tertullian acts by following a method of reasoned argument. The meaning of the phrase may relate to 1 Corinthians 1:17–31, where something foolish to a human may be a part of God&#x27;s wisdom, or Tertullian may be repeating an idea rehearsed in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, where Aristotle argues that something is more credibly true if it is an incredible claim, on the reason that it would not have been made up if it were truly so incredible to the human mind. Eric Osborn concludes that &quot;the classic formula &quot;credo quia absurdum&quot; (even when corrected to &quot;quia ineptum&quot;) does not represent the thought of Tertullian.&quot;

=== Transmission into the early modern era and modern use ===

No notice was given to this maxim throughout the classical and medieval periods, however, the maxim first began to receive attention and then undergo change during the early modern era. In 1521, the humanist scholar Beatus Rhenanus produced an edition of Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;De carne Christi&quot;. The only French translation of this work to appear in the 17th century was Louis Giry&#x27;s 1661 edition. According to Peter Harrison, the first time that the maxim was quoted was in Thomas Browne&#x27;s highly influential religious classic &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (The Religion of a Doctor) of 1643, ensuring that the maxim received a wide audience at this time, and Browne also shifted the context of Tertullian&#x27;s phrase from a discourse against Marcion to personal faith, and also shifted the wording of the phrase from its original &quot;certum est, quia impossibile&quot; (&quot;&quot;It is certain&quot;, because it is impossible&quot;) to &quot;&quot;I believe&quot;, because it is impossible.&quot; Many of Browne&#x27;s contemporaries criticized him and Tertullian for this maxim, including Henry More, Edward Stillingfleet, Robert Boyle, and John Locke. As Protestant anti-Catholic polemic and rhetoric grew, many writers began associating certain Catholic doctrines (and later broadly to Christianity itself by some other writers), especially transubstantiation, with this maxim. The maxim was then brought to a French audience through Pierre Bayle&#x27;s highly influential 1697 &quot;Dictionnaire Historique et Critique&quot;, which catalogued controversies of philosophical and religious nature as well as historical events and persons related to them. Then Voltaire, in his anonymously published Le Dîner du comte de Boulainvillier (1767), took the maxim to the next step and shifted the phrase from &quot;I believe &quot;because it is impossible&quot;&quot; to &quot;I believe &quot;because it is absurd&quot;&quot;. Voltaire also attributed it to Augustine instead of Tertullian, a much more central figure in Christian history. The maxim would continue to be attributed to Augustine until Gaston de Flotte noted the original Latin and misattribution by Voltaire, however, the rhetorical appeal of the maxim was great enough that it continued to be widely used, even to the present day, including being used by figures like Sigmund Freud, Ernst Cassirer, Max Weber, Richard Dawkins, Jerry Coyne and even Simon Blackburn&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy&quot;.

=== Later commentary ===

The phrase does not express the Catholic Faith, as explained by Pope Benedict XVI: &quot;The Catholic Tradition, from the outset, rejected the so-called &#x27;fideism&#x27;, which is the desire to believe against reason. &quot;Credo quia absurdum&quot; (I believe because it is absurd) is not a formula that interprets the Catholic faith.&quot;

The phrase is thus sometimes associated with the doctrine of fideism, that is, &quot;a system of philosophy or an attitude of mind, which, denying the power of unaided human reason to reach certitude, affirms that the fundamental act of human knowledge consists in an act of faith, and the supreme criterion of certitude is authority&quot; according to the 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, which later states, &quot;It is not surprising, therefore, that the Church has condemned such doctrines&quot;.

The phrase has also been used, though often in different interpretations, by some existentialists. For example, Nietzsche, arguably the earliest existentialist and nonetheless already venturing far beyond this influential set of currents, posited:Many have no doubt attained to that humility which says: &quot;credo quia absurdum est&quot; and sacrificed their reason to it: but, so far as I know, no one has yet attained to that humility which says: &quot;credo quia absurdus sum&quot;, though it is only one step further. The phrase inspired a celebrated &quot;bon mot&quot; by H.L. Mencken: &quot;Tertullian is credited with the motto &quot;Credo quia absurdum&quot;—&#x27;I believe because it is impossible&#x27;. Needless to say, he began life as a lawyer.&quot; It has also been adopted as the motto for The Ancient and Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus in modern times, and was used as an example of zen in D. T. Suzuki&#x27;s book, Introduction to Zen Buddhism (which was based on essays he wrote in 1914):

&quot;A noted Christian Father of the early Middle Ages once exclaimed: &quot;O poor Aristotle! Thou who has discovered for the heretics the art of dialectics, the art of building up and destroying, the art of discussing all things and accomplishing nothing!&quot; So much ado about nothing, indeed! See how philosophers of all ages contradict one another after spending all their logical acumen and analytical ingenuity on the so-called problems of science and knowledge. No wonder the same old wise man, wanting to put a stop once for all to all such profitless discussions, has boldly thrown the following bomb right into the midst of those sand-builders: &quot;Certum est quia impossible est&quot;; or, more logically, &quot;Credo quia absurdum est&quot;. I believe because it is irrational; is this not an unqualified confirmation of Zen?&quot;

<text>Filoli, also known as the Bourn-Roth Estate, is a country house set in of formal gardens surrounded by a estate, located in Woodside, California, about south of San Francisco, at the southern end of Crystal Springs Reservoir, on the eastern slope of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Now owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Filoli is open to the public. The site is both a California Historical Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

===Bourn family===
Filoli was built between 1915 and 1917 for William Bowers Bourn II, owner of one of California&#x27;s richest gold mines and president of Spring Valley Water Company, which supplied San Francisco&#x27;s water, and his wife, Agnes Moody Bourn. They wanted a country estate nearer to their home in San Francisco. The principal designer, San Francisco architect Willis Polk, used a free Georgian style that incorporated the tiled roofs characteristic of California. Polk had previously designed Bourn&#x27;s houses in Grass Valley and on Webster Street in San Francisco. Polk&#x27;s friend, artist and designer Bruce Porter, was commissioned to collaborate with the Bourns in planning the gardens, which were laid out between 1917 and 1922. The horticulturist who designed the plantings and fixed the original color schemes was Isabella Worn; she supervised the garden&#x27;s maintenance for 35 years.

Filoli served as one of the Bourns&#x27; residences from 1917 to 1936. The name of the estate is an acronym formed by combining the first two letters from the key words of William Bourn&#x27;s credo: &quot;Fight for a just cause; Love your fellow man; Live a good life.&quot;

Bourn&#x27;s Spring Valley Water Company owned Crystal Springs Reservoir and the surrounding area. Bourn called the Crystal Springs Reservoirs &quot;Spring Valley Lakes&quot; for his company. The original Spring Valley was between Mason and Taylor Streets, and Washington and Broadway Streets in San Francisco, where the water company started. When the company went south for more water, the Spring Valley name was carried south too.

Bourn also owned Muckross House in Ireland and is reputed to have used Muckross as a model for Filoli.

=== Roth family and National Trust for Historic Preservation ===
Following the deaths of William and Agnes Bourn in 1936, the estate was sold the following year to Mr. William P. Roth and Mrs. Lurline Matson Roth, heiress to the Matson Navigation Company. The Roth family built Filoli&#x27;s botanic collections of camellias, rhododendrons and azaleas, notably in the Woodland Garden, and added the serene swimming pool and the screened-in teahouse. In 1975, Mrs. Roth donated the estate in its entirety to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, with an endowment that helps support annual operating expenses. 

In 2023, Filoli hosted the first meeting on U.S. soil in several years between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the 2023 APEC summit in San Francisco. The two world leaders met at Filoli on November 15, 2023, during President Xi&#x27;s visit to California. Although Filoli had been popular for many years with Asian tourists visiting the San Francisco Bay Area (due to its gardens and its prominent appearance in the opening credits of the television series &quot;Dynasty&quot;), the extensive press coverage of the Xi-Biden meeting led to a surge of interest among both Chinese and Chinese American tourists.

==Management==
The estate operates as Filoli Center, a private, non-profit organization with its own Board of Governors, staff, and volunteers. As of 2022, Filoli was drawing about 400,000 visitors per year.

== House ==
The house is in size, and has a total of 56 rooms. This includes a ballroom, a reception room, a dining room, cozier family rooms, and servants quarters. While the home was empty when it reached the National Trust, much of the original furniture and art has been donated, to help recreate the original appearance of the home. This is an ongoing effort; in 2022 the gentleman&#x27;s lounge was restructured to include new period-typical additions to the room and add a re-creation of the original wallpaper.

== Library ==
Filoli houses two libraries with resources related to the families and the estate: the Friends Library Collection and the Sterling Library Collection. The Friends Library is a circulation library that holds 1,500 books, 125 videos, lectures, or oral histories, and several copies of movies filmed on the estate. The Sterling Library is a research library with 1,800 books and 40 journals. Both libraries are only open to Filoli members or to researchers.

==Gardens==

The of gardens are structured as a series of formally enclosed spaces framed by brick walls and clipped hedges, which open one from another, providing long axial views, in which profuse naturalized plantings of hardy and annual plants contrast with lawns, brick and gravel paths, formal reflecting pools, framed in walls and clipped hedging in box, holly, laurel, and yew (&quot;illustration, right&quot;) and punctuated by massive terracotta pots and many narrowly columnar Irish yews, originally grown on the estate from cuttings. Filoli is an outstanding example of the Anglo-American gardening style reintroducing Italian formality, that was pioneered at the end of the nineteenth century by Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll in British gardens and exemplified in the U.S. by designs of Charles A. Platt and Beatrix Farrand.

The gardens extend southeast of the house running up an easy slope. The sunken garden is the first of four main rooms; the rectangular pool at its center that houses hardy and tropical water lilies is flanked by twin panels of lawn and two olive trees, within the hedge of clipped Japanese yew. The walled garden consists of a series of enclosures, including the stained glass window design outlined in clipped box.

After it was acquired by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1975, Filoli has been open for public tours. Attractions include self-guided tours, guided tours, and nature hikes.

The formal gardens include several areas, including the Wedding Place, named for Berenice Roth&#x27;s wedding location in 1941. Lurline and Berenice both had their wedding receptions at Filoli, but Berenice&#x27;s wedding is the only one that has ever taken place at Filoli when it was a private home. The largest gardens are working gardens for the production of cut flowers for the mansion and for the growing of some vegetables.

=== Orchard ===
Filoli Gentlemen&#x27;s Orchard was started by Bourn family in the early 20th century, however the Roth family did not maintain the orchard and by the 1970s it was in poor condition. In 1997, the California Rare Fruit Growers began donating rare plants to restore the orchard. Many of the current 650+ trees in the orchard are lost varieties of fruit and include: 275 varieties of apple trees, 59 pear varieties, 42 peach varieties, 6 medlar, and many more.

==Ecology and conservation==

Laguna Creek, locally known as &quot;Orchard Creek&quot;, flows northwest from its origin on the western slope of Edgewood County Park to Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir where its waters eventually join San Mateo Creek, and descend to San Francisco Bay. In November 1769, Laguna Creek was the route of the Portolà expedition as they descended from their discovery of San Francisco Bay on Sweeney Ridge down San Andreas Creek to Laguna Creek and then southeast down the San Francisquito Creek watershed to El Palo Alto. After crossing to the west side of Cañada Road, Laguna Creek is joined on the left (heading downstream) by the South Fork Laguna Creek, then after crossing under the main entrance road to Filoli it is joined by locally named Fault Creek, then Spring Creek (possibly named by Bourn for his Spring Valley Water Company), then on the right by an unnamed creek, then by waters from the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct and Pulgas Water Temple just before entering Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir. Historically, the San Mateo Creek watershed hosted runs of anadromous salmonids, including coho salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;) and steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus&quot;) coming up from the Bay. In 1877, Laguna Grande, a natural lake on Laguna Creek, was dammed with an earthen causeway (now crossed by Highway 92) blocking further salmonid migration up into Laguna Creek and its tributaries on Filoli. Stream resident rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;), continue to run up the creeks of Filoli from the reservoir to spawn.

San Mateo County historian Frank Stanger cited sizeable groves of redwoods (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) in the Laguna Creek watershed. In the area around Filoli he described two historic lumber mills. The historic &quot;Smith Mill&quot; on Fault Creek was destroyed by fire in 1854. Pinckney&#x27;s mill in &quot;the largest gulch&quot;, which would be Spring Creek, was built in 1855 and later purchased by S. L. Mastic. Although information on these mills is limited, they support the idea that &quot;the area was thoroughly logged&quot;. A large redwood tree remains on Laguna Creek just below the lower Filoli parking lot and on the main entrance road.

=== Estate Trail ===
In 2017, Filoli added The Estate Trail, which gives visitors the opportunity to walk through the outer nature preserve of Filoli. This trail passes through the horse pasture, a field of native plants, the former horse barn, and a former barn that has been turned into the Sally MacBride Nature Center. It also leads to a bridge over the San Andreas Fault, which cuts through the property.

==Film location==
Filoli has served as the set for many Hollywood films. Most famously, it is the mansion seen from the air in the opening credits of the television series &quot;Dynasty&quot;. The mansion&#x27;s plush interiors were also featured in the first episodes of the series but were subsequently replicated on sound stages at the Fox Studios, Century City. However the entire mansion served as the setting for the 2006 CBS Television special &quot;Dynasty Reunion: Catfights &amp; Caviar&quot; in which cast members reunited to discuss their memories of the series. It was the first time many of the cast members had been to the actual estate.

Among the many striking mature trees on the grounds are a row of immense Italian Stone Pines and scattered specimen native Coast Live Oaks over 250 years in age, the latter of which are the backdrop for Warren Beatty&#x27;s outdoor scenes in &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;.

Filoli was featured in Bob Vila&#x27;s A&amp;E Network production &quot;Guide to Historic Homes of America&quot; as well as in a November 1996 segment of A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Castles: Garden Estates&quot;, the latter being shown continuously at the visitor center.

The house also served as the Stanhope residence in the 1997 film &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, and was featured in &quot;The Game&quot; in the same year.

<text>The  (English: Palace of the Popes; &quot;lo Palais dei Papas&quot; in Occitan) in Avignon, Southern France, is one of the largest and most important medieval Gothic buildings in Europe. Once a fortress and palace, the papal residence was a seat of Western Christianity during the 14th century. Six papal conclaves were held in the Palais, leading to the elections of Benedict XII in 1334, Clement VI in 1342, Innocent VI in 1352, Urban V in 1362, Gregory XI in 1370 and Benedict XIII in 1394. In 1995, the was classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its outstanding architecture and historical importance for the papacy.

==Description==
The Palais is actually two joined buildings: the old palais of Benedict XII, which sits on the impregnable rock of Doms, and the new palais of Clement VI, the most extravagant of the Avignon popes. Together they form the largest Gothic building of the Middle Ages. It is also one of the best examples of the International Gothic architectural style. The construction design was the work of two of France&#x27;s best architects, Pierre Peysson and Jean de Louvres, and the lavish ornamentation was the work of two of the best students of the School of Siena (Italy), Simone Martini and Matteo Giovanetti.

In addition, the papal library housed in the Palais (the largest in Europe at the time with over 2,000 volumes), attracted a group of clerics passionate in the study of &quot;belles-lettres&quot;, amongst them the founder of humanism, Petrarch. At the same time, composers, singers and musicians were drawn to the Great Chapel of the Palais. It was there that Clement VI used the &quot;Mass of Notre-Dame&quot; of Guillaume de Machaut, there that Philippe de Vitry at the pope&#x27;s invitation presented his &quot;Ars Nova,&quot; and there that Johannes Ciconia came to study.

Due to its immense size, the Palais was also the place where the general organisation of the Church began to change. It facilitated the centralisation of services and the adaptation of operations in order to suit the needs of the papacy, creating a truly central administration for the Church. The manpower of the Curia (Church administration), while 200 at the end of the 13th century, surpassed 300 at the beginning of the 14th century and reached 500 people in 1316. To this were added over 1,000 lay officials working within the Palais.

Despite this, the Palais became obsolete when the papacy found it necessary to return to Rome. The hope of reuniting Latin and Orthodox Christians, along with the achievement of peace in the Papal States in Italy, made the case for returning stronger. Added to that was the strong conviction of both Urban V and Gregory XI that the seat of the papacy could only be the tomb of St Peter. Despite strong opposition from the Court of France and the College of Cardinals, both popes found the means to return to Rome, the first, on 30 April 1362, the second on 13 September 1370. This time, the return was absolute.

In the following centuries, the Palais lost all of its former glory, despite serving as the seat of two anti-popes and many cardinals. It retained, however, a &quot;work of destruction&quot; aspect that French poets and writers such as Charles Forbes René de Montalembert have referred to over the centuries, with its powerful sense of beauty, simplicity, grandeur and immortality.

==History==

The palace&#x27;s groundbreaking began in AD 1252. Under Philip IV of France who had conflict with Pope Boniface VIII which ended in his death and Pope Benedict XI a mere puppet of Philip who only lasted eight months, Avignon would become the residence of succeeding pontiffs in 1309, when the Gascon Bertrand de Goth, as Pope Clement V, unwilling to face the violent chaos of Rome after his election (1305), moved the Papal Curia to Avignon during the &quot;Avignon Papacy&quot;. Clement lived as a guest in the Dominican monastery at Avignon, and his successor Pope John XXII set up a magnificent establishment there, but the reconstruction of the old bishops&#x27; palace was begun in earnest by Pope Benedict XII (1334–42) and continued by his successors to 1364. The site, on a natural rocky outcrop at the northern edge of Avignon, overlooking the river Rhône, was that of the old episcopal palace of the bishops of Avignon. The Palais was built in two principal phases with two distinct segments, known as the &quot;Palais Vieux&quot; (Old Palace) and &quot;Palais Neuf&quot; (New Palace). By the time of its completion, it occupied an area of . The building was enormously expensive, consuming much of the papacy&#x27;s income during its construction.

The Palais Vieux was constructed by the architect Pierre Poisson of Mirepoix at the instruction of Pope Benedict XII. The austere Benedict had the original episcopal palace razed and replaced with a much larger building centred on a cloister, heavily fortified against attackers. Its four wings are flanked with high towers.

Under Popes Clement VI, Innocent VI and Urban V, the building was expanded to form what is now known as the Palais Neuf. An architect, Jean de Louvres, was commissioned by Clement VI to build a new tower and adjoining buildings, including a long Grand Chapel to serve as the location for papal acts of worship. Two more towers and a bridge were built under Innocent VI. Urban V completed the main courtyard (known as the Court of Honor) with further buildings enclosing it. The interior of the building was sumptuously decorated with frescos, tapestries, paintings, sculptures, and wooden ceilings.

The popes departed Avignon in 1377, returning to Rome, but this prompted the Papal Schism during which time the antipopes Clement VII and Benedict XIII made Avignon their home until 1403. The latter was imprisoned in the Palais for five years after being besieged in 1398 when the army of Geoffrey Boucicaut occupied Avignon. The building remained in the hands of antipapal forces for some years – it was besieged from 1410 to 1411 – but was returned to the authority of papal legates in 1433.

Although the Palais remained under papal control (along with the surrounding city and Comtat Venaissin) for over 350 years afterward, it gradually deteriorated despite a restoration in 1516. When the French Revolution broke out in 1789 it was already in a bad state when it was seized and sacked by revolutionary forces. In 1791 it became the scene of a massacre of counter-revolutionaries, whose bodies were thrown into the Tour des Latrines in the Palais Vieux.

The Palais was subsequently taken over by the Napoleonic French state for use as a military barracks and prison. Although it was further damaged by the military occupation, especially under the anti-clerical Third Republic when the remaining interior woodwork was cleared away for use of the structure as a stables – the frescos were covered over and largely destroyed – this ensured the shell of the building&#x27;s physical survival. It was vacated in only 1906, when it became a national museum. It has been under virtually constant restoration ever since.

Charles Dickens describes a tour around this building in his book, &quot;Pictures from Italy&quot;. He describes his guide as a she-devil with flashing black eyes who glories in the gory past when the building was used as a torture chamber.

==Present==

The Palais today is a historical and architectural landmark and primarily a tourist attraction, drawing around 650,000 visitors per annum, putting it regularly in the top ten most visited attractions in France. It also houses a large convention centre and the archives of the &quot;département&quot; of Vaucluse, which include a research centre on the papacy of Avignon, organised jointly by the École française de Rome and the &quot;institut de recherche et d&#x27;histoire des textes&quot;.

The Palais regularly serves as an exhibition centre. The first major exhibition was initiated by René Char, in the Grand Chapel between 27 and 30 June 1947. Entitled &quot;Exposition de peintures et sculptures contemporaines&quot; (Exposition of contemporary painters and sculptors), it was the starting point for what would later become the Festival d&#x27;Avignon.

The courtyard of the Palais des Papes is a central performance location during the Festival d&#x27;Avignon, which is held every year in July. It is also the site of many cultural and economic events including exhibitions, shows, and conventions.

The Palais is also home to the International Congress Centre, which was established in 1976 and today hosts a large number of events annually. These include congresses, parliaments, symposia, reunions and other gatherings, with the largest room, the &#x27;Grande Audience&#x27;, able to hold up to 700 guests.
==Architecture==
With of floor space, the Palais is the largest Gothic palace in all of Europe and, due to its many architectural merits, one of the most important in the world. These merits were highlighted by Viollet-le-Duc, author of &quot;Dictionnaire raisonné de l&#x27;architecture française du XIe au XVIe siècle&quot; (Dictionary of French architecture from the 11th to the 16th century), who referred extensively to the Palais, including the thickness and height of its towers, the strength of its crenelated walls, the use of arches for support on its façades and its ability to withstand heavy and drawn-out sieges.
===The towers===

===Clément VI studium===

The studium, or private study of Clement VI, is commonly called the &quot;chambre du cerf&quot; (room of the stag), on account of the celebrated 14th-century frescoes, depicting courtly hunting scenes, that decorate the walls and vaults. The subject matter, while common in contemporary secular art, is as unexpected in a room supposedly dedicated to study as it is for a room in a papal apartment. The frescoes were probably painted by French artists, who were either highly influenced by Sienese art or assisted by Simone Martini and/or Matteo Giovanetti, both of whom served as Clement&#x27;s court painter.

===The Great Tinel===
This room was used primarily as a reception room. Covered with tapestries on starry blue background, there is actually nothing left of these decorations. Indeed, a fire destroyed the palace in the 14th century: many parts have been restored or rebuilt.

During conclaves, it was in this room that the cardinals met to elect a new pope. For the occasion, the room was walled and only a small aperture was left open to provide all the necessary food. After each conclave, the temporary walls were destroyed, revealing a vaulted room opening to the rest of the palace.

===The chapels===
====Saint-Martial chapel====

Located on the second level of the Saint-Jean tower, the &quot;Saint-Martial chapel&quot; relates through painting the main parts of Saint Martial&#x27;s life. Matteo Giovanetti worked there in 1344 and 1345. The reading direction of the painting should be made from top to bottom.

====Saint-Jean chapel====

From 1347 to 1348, Matteo Giovannetti was in charge of the Saint-Jean chapel, located under the Saint-Martial chapel. In contrast to the local holy figure Martial this chapel is dedicated to John the Baptist as well as John the Evangelist and is sometimes even implied to be a link back to Rome and Rome´s St. John Lateran. In this chapel painted by Matteo Giovannetti complex architecture in &quot;perspective construction and developed fictitious rooms and places that are more illusionistic than any pictures before them&quot; according to Dieter Blume an art historian and professor at the university of jena.

Since the chapel is quite limited in space just like the one of Staint Martial, the painter used all available space to make the stories of the two saints known. This is why on the ceiling you can see both holy men and their parents, grandmothers who are half-sisters according to the bible and therefore ad strong familiar bonds between the two saints. The north and east walls are filled with the stories of John the Baptist while John the Evangelist resides over the south and west walls of the 5,6 m x 5,3 m and 10 m high chapel.

== Art exhibitions at the Palais des Papes ==
The Palais des Papes regularly hosts art exhibitions. The tradition began in 1947, when the art critic Christian Zervos and the poet René Char organised an exhibition of the likes of Matisse, Picasso, Braque and Mondrian. The exhibitions shown since then include two exhibitions of Picasso (in 1970 and 1973), the comprehensive 2000 exhibition &quot;La beauté in fabula&quot; and, more recently, the exhibition &quot;Les Papesses&quot; (2013) and single exhibitions of Miquel Barceló (2010) and Stefan Szczesny (2014).

<text>Symphony No. 12 in D minor, Op. 112, titled The Year 1917, was composed by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1961. He dedicated it to the memory of Vladimir Lenin. Although the performance on October 1, 1961, by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky was billed as the official premiere, the actual first performance took place two hours earlier that same day in Kuybyshev by the conducted by Abram Stasevich.

== Form ==
The symphony, which is scored for large orchestra, runs 38 to 40 minutes. It is divided into four movements, which are played without pause:

==Overview==
===Composition===
Shostakovich had attempted, or at least announced his intent, to compose a symphony depicting Lenin as far back as the latter 1930s, elaborating on the subject in more than half a dozen interviews over two and a half years. He had planned this symphony as a biographical drama, tracing Lenin from his youth to the new Soviet society he had created and using text by such writers as Vladimir Mayakovsky. In December 1940 Shostakovich admitted that he had overreached and failed to write a Lenin cantata based on Mayakovsky&#x27;s text. But reports of a Lenin symphony continued well into 1941, dissipating only with the German invasion that June.

By the summer of 1959, Shostakovich again mentioned that he had a major work commemorating Lenin underway. &quot;What form my idea will take, whether it will be an oratorio, a cantata, a symphony, or a symphonic poem, I don&#x27;t want to predict. One thing is clear: the effort to embody the mighty image of the greatest man of our most complex epoch will demand the exertion of all creative resources.&quot; Though Shostakovich expressed the desire to have the work ready for the 90th anniversary of Lenin&#x27;s birth in April 1960, the date came and went without its completion. Progress was slowed further when the composer fell and broke his left leg at his son Maxim&#x27;s wedding in October 1960. He completed the work the following year.

=== Analysis ===
Like the Eleventh Symphony, the Twelfth is programmatic. Programmatic rather than musical considerations dictate its form, the subtitle and movement titles commemorating the Russian Revolution. But while, like the Eleventh, it has four movements played without break, the Twelfth does not recapture the sense of newsreel commentary that characterized the Eleventh. Instead, the movements become a series of reflections, as though one is watching a series of tableaux. (For this reason, the Twelfth was called a &quot;folk heroic epic&quot;, as opposed to the Eleventh, a &quot;folk music drama&quot;.) The Twelfth is also unlike its other direct ancestor, the experimental Second Symphony, in being extremely traditional, with the fast opening movement laid out along academically correct lines such as Myaskovsky and his teacher Glazunov followed.

===Political considerations===

That some critics, especially in the West, consider the Twelfth among the least satisfying musically of Shostakovich&#x27;s symphonies cannot be attributed to a creative slump, given that he had recently written the First Cello Concerto for Rostropovich and the Eighth String Quartet. Shostakovich had become a Party member in 1960 and may have felt compelled to write a Party line symphony to protect himself. That the composer would have felt compelled to do so in the midst of the Khrushchev Thaw could be questioned, and the government at this point in his career may have found it more politically expedient to exploit Shostakovich than to harass him. Still, the 1948 Zhdanov Doctrine had been rescinded only in 1958, and Shostakovich had not forgotten his 1936 denunciation. Nor was he totally free to express what he wished, as the political controversy over his Thirteenth Symphony would soon prove. Because of these circumstances, some critics have suggested that the Twelfth represents an unwelcome infiltration of officialdom into Shostakovich&#x27;s main compositional oeuvre, aside from his patriotic film scores and other commissioned works.

It has also been surmised that the naiveté of the Twelfth&#x27;s program, structure and thematic invention indicate that Shostakovich wrote it quickly after abandoning an earlier, possibly rashly satirical draft. The source of this story was the composer&#x27;s friend Lev Lebidinsky, whom the composer contacted a few days before the work&#x27;s premiere. This theory has two major challenges. First, Shostakovich had only a few days in which to rewrite a 40-minute symphony. Second, the work had already been performed before the Union of Composers on 8 September, so any substantial changes would have attracted considerable attention and comment. Although only a detailed analysis of the manuscript can confirm it, what seems more likely is that Shostakovich reconsidered his conception of the symphony radically between the summer of 1960 and the summer of 1961, when he completed the work.

=== Reception ===
The Twelfth Symphony was well received in the Soviet Union, though more coolly than its predecessor. The Eleventh was received fairly warmly in the West due in part to its assumed allusion to the Hungarian uprising of 1956, but the Twelfth&#x27;s apparently pro-Communist subject matter led to a poor reception there. The first UK performance took place at the Edinburgh Festival on 4 September 1962 with the composer present. It was compared unfavourably with the Fourth Symphony, which received its first performance outside of Russia just three days later. The critical success of the Fourth juxtaposed with the critical disdain for the Twelfth led to speculation that Shostakovich&#x27;s creative powers were on the wane. Western listeners became more receptive after the Cold War but the Twelfth remains among the less popular of Shostakovich&#x27;s symphonies due to its workmanlike nature.

<doc id="610670" wikidata="Q13128957" url="?curid=610670" title="Half-birthday">
<text>A half-birthday is a day approximately six months before or after the anniversary of a person&#x27;s birth. It is sometimes marked by people whose birthday either falls on major holidays, near major holidays, or both, the celebration of which may overshadow celebration of the birthday. It may also be marked by students whose birthday does not occur during the regular school year; a half-birthday allows a celebration with friends at school, with half a cake.

== Calculation ==
There are two ways to calculate half-birthdays.

The easier but less precise method is to take the number of the date of the birthday and advance the month by six: e.g. April 20 becomes October 20. More than 75% of the time this method results in a wrong date. Months don&#x27;t all have the same number of days, leap years add a day, and the second half of the year is longer than the first half. A good example where this doesn&#x27;t work is six months after an August 30 birthday would be February 30, which is nonexistent in the Gregorian calendar.

Accurate calculations require the addition or subtraction of half the number of days in a year from the birth date taking into account if the time period includes a leap day or not. In the case of a common year, this would be 182.5 days. In leap years, the number of days would be 183. This method would lead to a March 1 or February 29 half-birthday for an August 31 birthday, depending on whether it&#x27;s a leap year.

In the U.S., some tax-related penalties are related to half-years, such as a 10% penalty for making an early withdrawal from an IRA before age 59½. The federal government defines the half-year as being &quot;six calendar months&quot; after the anniversary of birth, regardless of what day of the month this produces. 

In many states in the U.S., the minimum age to obtain a learner permit occurs on a half-birthday, such as 14½ in Idaho, 14 years and eight months in Michigan, 15½ in California, and 15 years and nine months in Maryland. The same is true for receiving a restricted license for a minor in many states.

== Popular culture ==
At least three children&#x27;s books have been written about half-birthdays:
*
Mentions in TV Series
* He brought gelato to every birthday. And every half-birthday. Which all three of these kids now think is an actual thing.

<doc id="610672" wikidata="Q414454" url="?curid=610672" title="HMS Resolute (1850)">
<text>HMS &quot;Resolute&quot; was a barque-rigged ship of the British Royal Navy, specially outfitted for Arctic exploration. &quot;Resolute&quot; became trapped in the ice searching for Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition and was abandoned in 1854. Recovered by an American whaler, she was returned to Queen Victoria in 1856. Timbers from the ship were later used to construct the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk which was presented to the President of the United States and is located in the White House Oval Office.

==History==

In the face of rising concerns regarding the fate of the Arctic expedition of Sir John Franklin, having left Britain in 1845 in search of the North West Passage, the British Government sent expeditions in 1848 in search of the expedition. With few existing warships deemed suitable, six merchant ships were purchased between 1848 and 1850 and soon converted to exploration ships: two steamships, HMS &quot;Pioneer&quot; and HMS &quot;Intrepid&quot;, the other four (&quot;Resolute&quot;, , and ) seagoing sailing ships. The first ship to set sail in search of Franklin was HMS &quot;Herald&quot;, and at the helm, Captain Henry Kellett. &quot;Herald&quot; went through the Bering Strait to search the western reaches of the Canadian Arctic. In 1850, HMS &quot;Investigator&quot;, Captain McClure, and HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Captain Collinson were sent to the Arctic from the west.

&quot;Resolute&quot;, formerly known as the barque &quot;Ptarmigan&quot;, was purchased on 21 February 1850 and renamed a month later. Fitted for Arctic service by the Blackwall Civilian Shipyard Blackwall Yard, the refitting included installation of strong timbers, an internal heating system, and a polar bear as a figurehead.

During 1850–51, &quot;Resolute&quot; (flagship), &quot;Assistance&quot;, &quot;Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&quot;, sailed the eastern Arctic under the command of Horatio Thomas Austin. The expedition found traces of Franklin&#x27;s first winter camp on Beechey Island.

During the winter months, from October 1850 to March 1851, Second Master George F. McDougall, from &quot;Resolute&quot; and Lieutenant Sherard Osborn of &quot;Intrepid&quot; published five accounts in &quot;The Illustrated Arctic News&quot;, in what the editors identified as the &quot;Barrow Strait&quot;. Upon returning the &quot;Resolute&quot; to her home port in England, the manuscript paper was printed in London in 1852. Atwood (1997) references extant copies of the papers at both the British Museum and the Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge.

===Belcher Expedition===
After returning to England, the squadron assigned to Austin received provisions and placed under the command of Sir Edward Belcher. The Belcher Expedition was augmented by the addition of a fifth ship, &quot;North Star&quot; that remained at Beechey Island as a depot ship. Belcher&#x27;s orders contained the following objectives: to find Franklin, or evidence regarding his fate by broadening the search to the Eastern Canadian Arctic; and to split the expedition at Beechey Island and send &quot;Resolute&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&quot; west in search of Franklin, as well as secure provisions for &quot;Investigator&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The expedition left England in April 1852, and later crossed Baffin Bay westward in August 1852. After the rendezvous of the five ships at Beechey Island, splitting the squadron was necessary. The flagship &quot;Assistance&quot; and her steam tender, &quot;Pioneer&quot;, headed north up Wellington Channel. &quot;Resolute&quot;, then under Captain Kellett, and her steam tender, &quot;Intrepid&quot;, headed west and &quot;North Star&quot; remained at Beechey Island. In 1852, of the seven Royal Navy ships searching the Arctic, only &quot;Enterprise&quot; found traces of Franklin&#x27;s expedition in the form of a small quantity of timber on the eastern coast of Victoria Island.
The crew of &quot;Resolute&quot; set up winter camp and a temporary dock on the stationary land ice of Dealy Island near the north shore of Viscount Melville Sound. During the spring and summer of 1853, the crews of &quot;Resolute&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&quot; sledged aboard in search of clues to Franklin&#x27;s whereabouts in hope to locate &quot;Investigator&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;. They found neither Franklin nor &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but did succeed in finding and rescuing Captain McClure and his crew upon the ice-bound ship, HMS &quot;Investigator&quot; in April 1853. Captain Kellett ordered McClure to abandon &quot;Investigator&quot; due to the ship being frozen in ice since 1850. The lack of a proper spring and summer thaw kept the ship at bay. The conditions caused severe hardship for the crew, forcing the crew to reduce their rations for over a year. Before winter set in, and while passage remained open at Dealy Island, the 1852–53 winter camp was dissolved and &quot;Resolute&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&quot; sailed eastward. In August 1853, a cold front caused the open passage to freeze, encasing &quot;Resolute&quot; in ice. Since the flow direction of the water, and therefore the ice, was from the west to the east, &quot;Resolute&quot; moved east at about per day. The crew prepared the ship for the winter by stowing her sails and upper rigging below deck. &quot;Resolute&quot; was still beset by this floe ice in the spring of 1854. In April, Belcher ordered Captain Kellett to abandon &quot;Resolute&quot;. Despite his protest, Kellett obeyed orders and prepared the ship for winter. In May, Captain Kellett left &quot;Resolute&quot; locked in the slowly moving floe ice, and led his men in a hard march across the ice to reach the ships of the expedition at Beechey Island. Their number included the officers and crew of &quot;Investigator&quot;, rescued by Kellett in the spring of 1853, and the men from &quot;Intrepid&quot; and &quot;Resolute&quot;.

Two of the other main vessels of Belcher&#x27;s fleet were abandoned, the flagship &quot;Assistance&quot; and her steam tender, &quot;Pioneer&quot;. Belcher arrived at Beechey Island between May–August 1854. The men were divided into roles as crew to &quot;North Star&quot; and two relief ships: and , which arrived at Beechey Island just as the overcrowded &quot;North Star&quot; was about to sail. The men left Beechey Island on 29 August 1854.

The British Government announced in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; that the ships, including &quot;Resolute&quot;, were still Her Majesty&#x27;s property, but no salvage was attempted.

On 10 September 1855, the abandoned &quot;Resolute&quot; was found adrift by the American whaler &quot;George Henry&quot;, captained by James Buddington of Groton, Connecticut in an ice floe off Cape Walsingham of Baffin Island, from where she had been abandoned. An October 1856, &quot;New York Journal&quot; article relates Captain Budington and crew&#x27;s encounter: 
 Buddington split his crew, and took 13 men with him on the &quot;Resolute&quot;. He arrived home in New London, Connecticut on Christmas Eve.
Although most of the expeditions in search of the lost Franklin expedition, before 1856, were funded by either the British government or by public subscription from within the British Empire, two expeditions were funded by Henry Grinnell, a New York merchant and shipowner in New Bedford, in addition to the assistance offered by the United States Government. Senator James Mason of Virginia presented Congress with the bill to restore &quot;Resolute&quot; and return her to England as a gesture of &quot;national courtesy&quot;. Grinnell wrote in support of this bill. The United States Congress purchased the &quot;Resolute&quot; for $40,000. Once refitted, Commander Henry J. Hartstene sailed &quot;Resolute&quot; to England to present the ship to Queen Victoria on 13 December 1856, at East Cowes as a token of comity.

Both Grinnell and Lady Jane Franklin hoped the restored &quot;Resolute&quot; would once again be employed for a new expedition in search of the Franklin expedition. Evidence found by John Rae proved beyond reasonable doubt that the crew had suffered harsh conditions that led to their deaths. The British Government declined. Lady Franklin organized a private expedition under Francis Leopold McClintock, who, in 1859, located the only written account of the fate of Franklin.

&quot;Resolute&quot; served in the Royal Navy from 1856, but never left home waters. Retired in 1879, &quot;Resolute&quot; was later salvaged for timber. The Canadian settlement of Resolute, Nunavut, is named after the ship. In March 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown presented US President Barack Obama with the framed commission of &quot;Resolute&quot;, and a pen holder made from the wood of another Royal Navy ship, .

==The &quot;Resolute&quot; desks==

The British government ordered at least three desks to be made from the timbers of the ship, and they were constructed by cabinetmakers at the Joiner&#x27;s Shop of Chatham Dockyard. A large partner&#x27;s desk was presented to U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880 as a gesture of thanks for the rescue and return of &quot;Resolute&quot;. Since then, this desk—known as the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk—has been used by every American President in some capacity except Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. Eight Presidents have used it as their official desk in the Oval Office starting with John F. Kennedy, but some have had it in their private study in the Executive Residence.

A second desk, called the Grinnell Desk or, the Queen Victoria Desk, was also made from the timbers of HMS &quot;Resolute&quot;. This smaller lady&#x27;s desk was presented to the widow of Henry Grinnell in 1880 in recognition of her husband&#x27;s generous contributions to the search for Franklin. In 1983, it was given to the New Bedford Whaling Museum and is in their collection in New Bedford, Massachusetts.

A third desk, or more accurately a writing table, was commissioned by Queen Victoria; it remains part of the Royal Collection.

==HMS &quot;Resolute&quot; in popular media==
*The 2007 novel &quot;HMS Resolute&quot; by Elizabeth Matthews is about the discovery of &quot;Resolute&quot; by the whaler &quot;George Henry&quot;.
*HMS &quot;Resolute&quot;″s story is an integral clue in the plot of the film &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;. The relevance of the two desks to the discovery of further clues is concealed in the version of the Statue of Liberty upon the Île aux Cygnes in Paris, France. The anecdote &quot;These twins stand resolute to preserve what we are looking for&quot; refers to the twin &quot;Resolute&quot; desks made from the ship&#x27;s timbers, with one located in The White House and the other in the Royal Naval Museum at Portsmouth (though in the film, the desk is located in Buckingham Palace).
*The book &quot;Resolute&quot;, by Martin Sandler, tells the story, with historical accuracy, of all the different expeditions tied to the one by John Franklin, HMS &quot;Resolute&quot; being one of them.

<text>A cookie cutter in North American English, also known as a biscuit cutter outside North America, is a tool to cut out cookie/biscuit dough in a particular shape.

They are often used for seasonal occasions when well-known decorative shapes are desired, or for large batches of cookies where simplicity and uniformity are required. Cookie cutters can also be used for shaping, molding, forming and cutting numerous other types of foods, including meat patties, flapjacks, sandwiches and decorative embellishments for platters (for example, fancy-cut fruit).

==Types and variations==
;Cutout: Most commonly made of copper, tin, stainless steel, aluminium, or plastic. Cutouts are the simplest of the cookie cutters; the cutter is pressed into cookie dough that has been rolled flat to produce the shape of the cutter&#x27;s outline. To keep the dough from sticking, they are often dipped in flour or sugar before use. 
;Detail imprint: Commonly made of copper, tin, or plastic. Detail imprints are similar to cutout cookie cutters, except that detail imprints also mark the surface of the dough.
;Cookie mould: Usually made of wood, ceramic, or plastic. Springerle moulds are the oldest examples of such, and are popular for Scottish shortbread. A cookie mould typically has an ornate design debossed into the surface; the mould is pressed into the cookie dough to produce an embossed design. These moulds may be flat disks or may be in the shape of a rolling pin.
;Cookie press: An automated or hand-operated cookie press, also called a &quot;cookie gun&quot;, is used to make large batches of cookies quickly. The cookie dough is extruded onto the baking sheet in ornate shapes that would otherwise be too difficult or time-consuming to create by hand.
;Cookie cutting sheet: Used for larger volumes, a production cookie cutting sheet is a piece of sturdy plastic the size of a full sheet pan that essentially has dozens of cutout cookie cutters mounted on to it. Rather than rolling out the dough and pressing the cutter into the top of the dough, the cutting sheet is placed on the baking sheet, cutting side up. A sheet of cookie dough, already rolled to the correct thickness, is laid on top of the cutting sheet, and a rolling pin is used to press the dough down on to the sharp edges of the cutting sheet. The cut cookies fall through the holes into the sheet, into their properly spaced positions on the baking sheet. The scrap dough and cutting sheet are removed, and the pan is ready for baking. Cookie cutter sheets allow high volume production without the time or risk of moving cut cookies to baking sheets, resulting in rapid production of a more uniformly shaped and spaced product.

== Commercial scale ==
Cookie cutters generally make a single shape at one time, but other options are available for large-scale production.

In 1875, Alexander P. Ashbourne patented the first biscuit cutter in the US, useful for cutting multiple cookies, cakes, or baking powder biscuits at once. It consisted of a board to roll the dough out on, which was hinged to a metal plate with various cutting spring-loaded shapes mounted to it.

<doc id="610677" wikidata="Q4826683" url="?curid=610677" title="Automobile engine replacement">
<text>A replacement automobile engine is an engine or a major part of one that is sold alone, without the other parts required to make a functional car (for example a drivetrain). These engines are produced either as aftermarket parts or as reproductions of an engine that has gone out of production.

==Use==
Replacement engines are used to replace classic car engines that are in poor condition or broken, or to install a more powerful or more fuel efficient engine in a vehicle. Replacement engines are often used to make old cars more reliable for daily driving. Classic car hobbyists may also install reproductions of a rare powerplant in a classic car (this is most often seen in Mopar muscle cars that have the 426 Hemi installed into them).

Aftermarket engines are used in many forms of motorsport. Some late model racecar series use &quot;crate engines&quot; many of which are made by independent firms. This ensures that drivers all have similarly powered racecars. Legends and Allison Legacy Series cars also use sealed crate motors.

==Types of replacement engines==

The four most common types of replacement engines are:

* Remanufactured engines (also known as &quot;re-manned,&quot; &quot;reconditioned,&quot; or &quot;re-engineered&quot;)
* Rebuilt engines
* Used engines
* New engines (also known as &quot;crate engines&quot;)

==Terminology==
*Short block - everything between the cylinder head and the oil pan (excluding those items)
*Long block - a short block, with mounted and gasketed cylinder head, valves and camshaft
*Crate engine - a new or remanufactured engine, considered to be equivalent to a new engine. Parts include more than a long block, including intake manifold, and carburetor or fuel injection system, oil pan, valve covers, and perhaps an alternator

==Short block==

A short block is an engine sub-assembly comprising the portion of the cylinder block below the head gasket but above the oil pan, which usually includes the assembled engine block, crankshaft, connecting rods, and pistons with piston rings properly installed. An in-block cam engine short block includes the camshaft, timing gear, and any balance shafts. Overhead cam engines don&#x27;t include those parts. Short block engines became popular after World War II, when mass production led to great consistency between individual engines; before then, most engines were hand-built and had idiosyncratic variations. Short blocks became less popular after the 1970s when overhead camshaft (OHC) engines became the norm, as the rational unit of replacement was the long block, which includes the head, camshaft and valve gear.

A short block is the preferred replacement component for a worn-out engine that requires major servicing beyond the capabilities of a local repair garage, when instead a machine shop may be needed. The short block represents the major wear items of an engine: piston rings, and potentially a rebore of the cylinder bores or replacement liners, together with reground bearings on the crankshaft. Although replacing the rings or bearing shells was at one time considered typical garage work, the need for a boring or crank grinding machine now exceed the capabilities of a standard automotive repair garage. A short block includes the preassembled set of major parts needed that generally exceed the capability of the garage, in one item. 

The third item sometimes requiring machining, the re-cutting of valve seats in the cylinder head, was less frequently needed. Grinding of valves to fit was once a regular garage task, as was light re-cutting with hand tools, when cast iron seats were common. Once steel seat inserts came into use, either as a result of the switch to unleaded petrol in the 1970s or fitted into high-performance aluminium heads, machining of heads and the replacement of seats became equally commonly required. Aluminium cylinder heads could also be damaged by warping after overheating, often requiring machining to re-flatten them.

A short block has advantages over dismantling the engine and sending the crankshaft and other related automotive parts away for rework. It is usually quicker to obtain, requiring only a single shipment, rather than having to ship parts to and from the machine shop and the interim time spent at the shop to re-machine those parts. The short block would also have been built in a workshop that was hopefully cleaner and more organised for the specialism of engine building.

Short blocks were OHV engines. Sidevalves were pre-eminent before the short block appeared as a common item, and they also offered little saving by omitting the (simple) head.

==Long block==

A long block is an engine sub-assembly that consists of the assembled short block with crankshaft, cylinder head, camshaft (usually), and valve train. A long block does not include the fuel system, electrical, intake, and exhaust components, as well as other components. A long block may include the balancer/damper, timing cover, oil pan and valve covers.

A long block engine replacement typically requires swapping out parts from the original engine to the long block. These parts can include the oil pan, timing cover, valve covers, intake manifold, emission-control parts, carburetor or fuel injection system, the exhaust manifold(s), alternator, starter, power steering pump (if any), and air conditioner compressor (if any).

==Crate engine==

Technically, a &quot;crate engine&quot; or &quot;crate motor&quot; is any automobile engine that is shipped to the installer in a crate, which can include short or long block configurations. For this article, a crate engine is defined as a fully-assembled engine that includes more than what is typically installed on a long block; the exact configuration will vary by vendor. It is also sometimes known as a &quot;deluxe long block&quot;, which usually includes the fuel and intake system, distributor, oil pan, and ignition system. In some cases, exhaust manifold(s) and the water pump are included.

Crate engines are manufactured by many different companies, but they all share the same characteristics of being complete engines nearly ready to install once removed from the crate. Generally a crate engine still will require additional parts to be fitted, which can range from minor (engine oil dipstick) to major (intake manifold and fuel injection system), depending on the engine package purchased and the targeted vehicle application. This type of engine has various applications including general replacement, hot rod builds, and motorsports competition. Crate engines are often seen as an economical and more reliable solution as opposed to engine overhauls or custom builds. Such engines are built by specialist engine builders, working in clean and well-equipped workshops, rather than general purpose repair garages.

Crate engines may be either brand new, or substantially rebuilt. If rebuilt, they will have been rebuilt to an extent such that they are considered to be of equal quality, reliability and expected lifetime as a new engine.

=== Applications ===
Crate engines are well suited in many different vehicle platforms. Engines are often used in the following applications:
* General automobile engine replacement
* Custom hot rod street builds
* Marine engine replacements
* Motorsports Competition (Asphalt, dirt track, drag racing etc.)

=== Advantages ===
Crate engines are often seen as an economical choice no matter what the application is. In general automobile engine replacement, a crate engine is often very competitively priced when compared to the cost of a full rebuild of a faulty engine. It is also quicker to ship from stock than to wait an equal time for parts, then to begin a rebuild. Installers often opt for the crate engine because of the cost and ease of replacement. Crate engines are typically a bolt-in replacement with no internal work being performed to the engine compared to a complete overhaul that requires internal part replacement by trained mechanics. Hot Rod and other custom street applications also often choose a crate engine because of the higher value when compared to a custom built engine.

In motorsports, the crate engine option has become very popular for various reasons. Crate engines are often a more affordable option when compared to a purpose-built race engine so budget racers often go this route. The crate engine also has developed a large fan base in many different racing series because of the competitive racing. As all racers in the field have identical engines, the races are won by driver&#x27;s talent and chassis setup, and not the amount of horsepower a team can afford to build into their engine.

=== EV crate engines ===


In general, simply swapping an internal combustion engine for an electric traction motor is not sufficient; a complete electric vehicle (EV) drivetrain conversion also requires installation of a storage battery, inverter, reduction gear, and controller. Most of these separate components can be packaged with the motor in a unit that is dimensionally compatible with the existing engine compartment, but the battery is usually the bulkiest, heaviest component of an EV powertrain and can create a significant challenge for fitment. In recent years, the restoration and EV conversion of a classic car has become known as an &quot;electromod&quot;, a portmanteau of electrification and restomod.

Hobbyists have been converting cars to EVs since at least the 1960s. Historically, these have used aircraft starter motors and lead-acid batteries; several books have been written to document and guide these conversions, including &quot;The Complete Book of Electric Vehicles&quot; (Shacket, 1979), &quot;How to Convert to an Electric Car&quot; (Lucas &amp; Riess, 1980), &quot;Convert It&quot; (Brown &amp; Prange, 1993), and &quot;Build Your Own Electric Vehicle&quot; (Brant, 1994). Many recent non-factory electromods are implemented by extracting and adapting the complete drivetrain (traction motor(s), battery, controller, and inverter) from an existing mass-produced EV, such as Tesla. East Coast Defender demonstrated a Tesla EV-sourced powertrain conversion of a 1969–96 Range Rover Classic, developed with Electric Classic Cars, to &quot;Motor Trend&quot; in 2021. In October 2019 there were no purpose-built crate engine EV kits available commercially, but such projects were in development. For example, EV West announced their Revolt Tesla Crate Motor in 2020, which married an electric traction motor from Tesla with a gear reduction unit and ended in a universal joint yoke, a suitable interface for a driveshaft. Mechanically, the motor is fitted with mounts compatible with Chevrolet small-block engines to take advantage of numerous small-block repower kits.

====Automobile manufacturers====
Previously in 2018, Chevrolet Performance advanced an &quot;electric crate motor&quot; concept with the unveiling of the eCOPO Camaro at that year&#x27;s SEMA show. The eCOPO Camaro was a 2019 COPO Camaro which was equipped with a pair of BorgWarner HVH250-150 motor assemblies instead of the conventional piston engine. The electric traction motor essentially served as a drop-in replacement with the same bellhousing bolt pattern and crankshaft flange as the LS engine family, so the car retained the same transmission, driveshaft, and axles as the conventional COPO Camaro. At the 2019 SEMA show, Chevrolet continued to develop the concept, following up with the E-10 Concept, which used the powertrains from two Bolts repackaged into in a restored 1962 C-10 pickup truck. The following year for SEMA, Chevrolet showcased the &quot;Electric Connect and Cruise&quot; eCrate package in October 2020, which included the main drivetrain components of a single Bolt (motor, battery, controller, and inverter), and was demonstrated as a retrofit to a restored 1977 K5 Blazer. The kit was scheduled to go on sale in the second half of 2021. The Bolt motor is modified by removing the differential and reduction gear unit, then fitting an adapter plate and crank flange, allowing it to bolt to a conventional transmission. Together with the controller and inverter, the motor occupies approximately the same space as a small-block V8; the battery presents a greater challenge for packaging, which is why the initial development has focused on trucks. , it was still being explored as a &quot;future business opportunity&quot;, according to Chevrolet Vice President Scott Bell.
In November 2021, Ford Performance released the &quot;Eluminator&quot; crate EV motor, which was the same traction motor used in the Ford Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition and used to power the 1978 F-100 Eluminator restomod pickup truck. As of 3 November 2021, it was available for pre-order but not yet shipping.

===Common crate engines used in North American racing===
General Motors began developing several small block crate race car engines in 2001 and they were released into production in 2002. The engines are sealed and repairs being done by certified rebuilders. 

====Chevrolet 602====
The Chevrolet engine debuted in 2002 with part number 1958602 and sold for a little under $4000 in 2012. It has 350 cubic inch displacement via a 4.000 inch bore and 3.480 inch stroke. The 602 engine is equipped with iron heads, a cast-iron block, and aluminum pistons. It produces about 350 horsepower and 390 foot-pounds of torque at 9.1:1 compression.

Applications for this engine include: IMCA Hobby Stock, IMCA Northern Sport Modified, IMCA Southern Sport Modified, Mid-American Stock cars. Northeastern (United States) Sportman, Crate Racing USA, and others.

====Chevrolet 603====
The Chevrolet engine has part number 88959603. It has 355 cubic inch displacement and 405 foot pounds of torque at 10.1:1 compression. The 603 engine is equipped with aluminum heads, steel crank, and high silicon pistons. The American Canadian Tour (ACT) late model sportsman utilize this engine.

====Chevrolet 604====
The Chevrolet engine debuted in 2002 with part number 88958604 and sold for about $5000 in 2012. The 604 engine is equipped with aluminum heads, forged steel crankshaft, and an aluminum intake. It produces about 400 horsepower and 400 foot-pounds of torque with a 9.6:1 compression.

Applications for this engine includes IMCA Modifieds (starting in 2013), CRA All Stars Tour (allowed but not required), United Crate Racing Alliance, Big 8 Series, RUSH Late Models, Crate Racing USA, and others.

====Ford 347====

==Replacement blocks==
New castings of some engines are sometimes produced by independent companies. These blocks commonly replace rare or popular designs for aftermarket rebuilding, especially when the original is no longer produced. They are sometimes available in aluminum instead of original iron, or in stronger alloys. Often they imitate the larger available displacements that were produced in small numbers or allow for displacements never available.

<text>Palestrina (ancient &quot;Praeneste&quot;; , &quot;Prainestos&quot;) is a modern Italian city and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) with a population of about 22,000, in Lazio, about east of Rome. It is connected to the latter by the Via Prenestina. It is built upon the ruins of the ancient city of Praeneste.

Palestrina is the birthplace of composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.

==Geography==
Palestrina is sited on a spur of the Monti Prenestini, a mountain range in the central Apennines.

Modern Palestrina borders the following municipalities: Artena, Castel San Pietro Romano, Cave, Gallicano nel Lazio, Labico, Rocca di Cave, Rocca Priora, Rome, San Cesareo, Valmontone, Zagarolo.

==History==

===Ancient Praeneste===
Ancient mythology connected the origin of Praeneste to Ulysses, or to other fabled characters such as Caeculus, Telegonus, Erulus or &quot;Praenestus&quot;. The name probably derives from the word &quot;Praenesteus&quot;, referring to its overlooking location.

Early burials show that the site was already occupied in the 8th or 7th century BC. The ancient necropolis lies on a plateau at the foot of the hill below the ancient town. Of the objects found in the oldest graves, and supposed to date from about the 7th century BC, the cups of silver and silver-gilt and most of the gold and amber jewelry are Phoenician (possibly Carthaginian), but the bronzes and some of the ivory articles seem to be of the Etruscan civilization.

Praeneste was probably under the hegemony of Alba Longa while that city was the head of the Latin League. It withdrew from the league in 499 BC, according to Livy (its earliest historical mention), and formed an alliance with Rome, the action which led to a battle between the latter and thirty Latin states. After Rome was weakened by the Gauls of Brennus (390 BC), Praeneste switched allegiances and fought against Rome in the long struggles that culminated in the Latin War. From 373 to 370, it was in continual war against Rome or her allies, and was defeated by Cincinnatus.

=== Republican Rome ===

Eventually in 354 and in 338 the Romans were victorious and Praeneste was punished by the loss of portions of its territory, becoming a city allied to Rome. As such, it furnished contingents to the Roman army, and Roman exiles were permitted to live at Praeneste, which grew prosperous. The roses of Praeneste were a byword for profusion and beauty. Præneste was situated on the Via Praenestina.

Praenestine graves from about 240 BC onwards have been found: they are surmounted by the characteristic cippus made of local stone, containing stone coffins with rich bronze, ivory and gold ornaments beside the skeleton. From these come the famous bronze boxes (&quot;cistae&quot;) and hand mirrors with inscriptions partly in Etruscan. Also famous is the bronze Ficoroni Cista (Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia, Rome), engraved with pictures of the arrival of the Argonauts in Bithynia and the victory of Pollux over Amycus, found in 1738. An example of archaic Latin is the inscription on the &quot;Ficoroni Cista&quot;: &quot;Novios Plautios Romai med fecid / Dindia Macolnia fileai dedit&quot; (&quot;Novios Plautios made me in Rome, Dindia Macolnia gave me to her daughter&quot;). The caskets are unique in Italy, but a large number of mirrors of precisely similar style have been discovered in Etruria. Hence, although it would be reasonable to conjecture that objects with Etruscan characteristics came from Etruria, the evidence points decisively to an Etruscan factory in or near Praeneste itself. Other imported objects in the burials show that Praeneste traded not only with Etruria but also with the Greek east.

Its citizens were offered Roman citizenship in 90 BC in the Social War, when concessions had to be made by Rome to cement necessary alliances. In Sulla&#x27;s civil war, Gaius Marius was blockaded in the town by the forces of Sulla (82 BC). When the city was captured, Marius slew himself, the male inhabitants were massacred in cold blood, and a military colony was settled on part of its territory. From an inscription it appears that Sulla delegated the foundation of the new colony to Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus, who was consul in 73 BC. Within a decade the lands of the colonia had been assembled by a few large landowners.

From the late Republic to the late Empire, markets, baths, shrines and even a second forum were built in the lower city, near today&#x27;s Madonna dell&#x27;Aquila.

=== The Empire ===

Under the Empire the cool breezes of Praeneste made it a favourite summer resort of wealthy Romans, whose villas studded the neighbourhood, though they ridiculed the language and the rough manners of the native inhabitants. The poet Horace ranked &quot;cool Praeneste&quot; with Tibur and Baiae as favoured resorts. The emperor Augustus stayed in Praeneste, and Tiberius recovered there from a dangerous illness and made it a municipium. The emperor Marcus Aurelius was at Praeneste with his family when his 7-year-old son Verus died. The ruins of the imperial villa associated with Hadrian stand in the plain near the church of S. Maria della Villa, about three-quarters of a mile from the town. At the site was discovered the statue of the &quot;Braschi Antinous&quot;, now in the Vatican Museums. Gaius Appuleius Diocles (104after 146 AD), a Roman charioteer from Lamego in Lusitania (modern-day Portugal) who became one of the most celebrated athletes in ancient history and is often cited as the highest-paid athlete of all time, was living in Praeneste after his retirement and died there. Pliny the Younger also had a villa at Praeneste, and L. Aurelius Avianius Symmachus retired there.

Inscriptions show that the inhabitants of Praeneste were fond of gladiatorial shows.

====Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia====


Praeneste was chiefly famed for its great Temple of Fortuna Primigenia connected with the oracle known as the Praenestine lots (&quot;sortes praenestinae&quot;).

====The Forum of Praeneste====

Archaeologists working in the 1950s were able to identify the area around the Cathedral and the Piazza Regina Margherita as the Forum of Ancient Praeneste. The buildings of the forum comprised a central temple, whose walls were re-used for the cathedral, and a two-storey civil basilica consisting of four naves separated by columns, once roofed but today an open space. The basilica was flanked by two buildings, the easternmost containing a raised podium (&quot;suggestus&quot;) and the public treasury, the &quot;aerarium&quot;, identified by an inscription dating it to ~150 BC. At some later date (perhaps around 110-100 BC), the buildings flanking the basilica were each embellished with a nymphaeum with a mosaic floor. The western mosaic represents a seascape: a temple of Poseidon on the shore, with fish of all kinds swimming in the sea. The eastern building was decorated with the famous mosaic with scenes from the Nile, relaid in the Palazzo Colonna Barberini in Palestrina on the uppermost terrace (now the National Archaeological Museum of Palestrina).

In the forum area an obelisk was erected in the reign of Claudius, fragments of which can be seen in the National Archaeological Museum of Palestrina.

====Roman gentes with origins in Praeneste====
* Anicia gens
* Caecilia gens
* Opellia gens
* Selicia gens

===Medieval history===
The modern town is built on the ruins of the temple of Fortuna Primigenia. A bishop of Praeneste is first mentioned in 313.

In 1297 the Colonna family, which had owned Praeneste (then known as Palestrina) from the eleventh century as a fief, revolted against Pope Boniface VIII. In the following year the town was taken by Boniface&#x27;s Papal forces, razed to the ground and salted by order of the pontiff.

In 1437 the rebuilt city was captured by Giovanni Vitelleschi, a condottiero in the service of the papacy, and once more utterly destroyed at the command of Pope Eugenius IV. It was rebuilt once more and fortified by Stefano Colonna in 1448. It was sacked in 1527 and occupied by the Duke of Alba in 1556.

===Barberini Family===


In 1630, the comune passed by purchase into the Barberini family. It is likely the transfer was included as one of the conditions of the marriage of Taddeo Barberini and Anna Colonna. Thereafter, the famously nepotistic family, headed by Maffeo Barberini (later Pope Urban VIII), treated the &quot;comune&quot; as a principality in its own right.

Patriarchs of the Barberini family conferred, on various family members, the title of Prince of Palestrina. During the reign of Urban VIII, the title became interchangeable with that of &quot;Commander of the Papal Army&quot; (Gonfalonier of the Church) as the Barberini family controlled the papacy and the Palestrina principality.

The Wars of Castro ended (while Taddeo Barberini held both titles) and members of the Barberini family (including Taddeo) fled into exile after the newly elected Pope Innocent X launched an investigation into members of the Barberini family. Later the Barberini reconciled with the papacy when Pope Innocent X elevated Taddeo&#x27;s son, Carlo Barberini to the cardinalate and his brother Maffeo Barberini married a niece of the Pope and reclaimed the title Prince of Palestrina.

Two members of the Barberini family were named Cardinal-Bishop of the Diocese of Palestrina: Antonio Barberini and Francesco Barberini (Junior), the son of Maffeo Barberini.

The Barberini Palace originally included the Nile mosaic of Palestrina.

===Modern history===
Palestrina was the scene of an 1849 action between Garibaldi and the Neapolitan army during his defence of the Roman Republic.

The centre of the city was destroyed by Allied bombings during World War II, but that brought the ancient remains of the sanctuary to light.

==Main sights==
The modern town of Palestrina is centered on the terraces once occupied by the massive temple of Fortuna. The town came to largely obscure the temple, the monumental remains of which were revealed as a result of American bombing of German positions in World War II. The town also contains remnants of ancient cyclopean walls.

On the summit of the hill at , nearly from the town, stood the ancient citadel, the site of which is now occupied by a few poor houses (Castel San Pietro) and a ruined medieval castle of the Colonna family. The view embraces the Monte Soratte, Rome, the Alban Hills, and the Pontinian Plain as far as the sea. Considerable portions of the southern wall of the ancient citadel, built in massive cyclopean masonry consisting of limestone blocks, are still visible; and the two walls, also polygonal, which formerly united the citadel with the town, can still be traced.

A calendar, which according to Suetonius was set up by the grammarian Marcus Verrius Flaccus in the imperial forum of Praeneste (at the Madonna dell&#x27;Aquila), was discovered in 1771 in the ruins of the church of Saint Agapitus, where it had been used as building material.

The cathedral, just below the level of the temple, occupies the former civil basilica of the town, whose façade includes a sundial described by Varro, traces of which may still be seen. In the modern piazza the steps leading up to this basilica and the base of a large monument were found in 1907; evidently only part of the piazza represents the ancient forum. The cathedral has fine paintings and frescoes. In the Church of &quot;Santa Rosalia &quot;(1677) there is a noteworthy &quot;Pietà&quot;, carved in the solid rock.

The National Archeological Museum of Palestrina is housed inside the Renaissance Barberini Palace, the former baronial palace, built above the ancient temple of Fortuna. It exhibits the most important works from the ancient town of Praeneste. The famous sculpture of the Capitoline Triad is exhibited on the first floor. The second floor is dedicated to the necropoli and sanctuaries, while the third floor contains a large polychrome mosaic depicting the flooding of the Nile (Nile mosaic of Palestrina).

==Famous residents==
Palestrina was the home town of the 3rd-century Roman writer Aelian, and of the 16th-century composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.

Thomas Mann spent some time there in 1895 and, two years later, during the long harsh summer of 1897, he stayed over again, with his brother Heinrich Mann, in a sojourn that provided the backdrop, nearly half a century later, for Adrian Leverkühn&#x27;s pact with the Devil in Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Doktor Faustus&quot;.

==In popular culture==

In &quot;Inferno&quot;, Dante makes reference to advice given by Guido da Montefeltro to Pope Boniface VIII to entice the surrender of Palestrina in 1298 by offering the Colonna family an amnesty. The amnesty was never intended be honored, and instead Palestrina was razed to the ground.

In Voltaire&#x27;s novel &quot;Candide&quot; a woman claims to be the daughter of Pope Urban X and the Princess of Palestrina.

A fictional account of Garibaldi&#x27;s 1849 action at Palestrina appears in Geoffrey Trease&#x27;s novel &quot;Follow My Black Plume&quot;.

<text>No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron Royal Air Force, also written XXXII Squadron Royal Air Force, sometimes abbreviated as No. 32 (TR) Squadron of the Royal Air Force (RAF). No.32 is a current flying squadron which operates in the VIP and general air transport roles. It is based at RAF Northolt in Greater London, England.

Originally formed in 1916 as part of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), the squadron saw action during the First and Second World Wars with fighter aircraft, but was disbanded in 1969. The Metropolitan Communications Squadron, involved in the VIP transport role, was renamed as No. 32 Squadron at that time. In 1995, the squadron was merged with the Queen&#x27;s Flight, and incorporated &#x27;The Royal&#x27; title into its name. At this time, the squadron moved from RAF Benson in Oxfordshire to RAF Northolt in Greater London, where it remains.

The merger ended the RAF&#x27;s provision of dedicated VIP transport aircraft; the squadron&#x27;s aircraft are available to VIP passengers only if they are not needed for military operations. , one flight within the squadron operates the Dassault Envoy IV CC1 fixed-wing aircraft.

==History==
===Formation and First World War===

No. 32 Squadron was formed as part of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) on , at Netheravon in Wiltshire, and moved to France as a fighter squadron equipped with the Airco DH.2 in May. On 1 July 1916, its commanding officer, Major (later Group Captain) Lionel Rees, was engaged in a combat with eight German Albatros two-seater aircraft, and although wounded in the leg, managed to scatter the German aircraft, driving down two of the enemy, for which action he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

The squadron continued to fly patrols over the Western Front, including over the Somme and Arras battlefields, for a year before beginning to re-equip with the Airco DH.5, specialising in ground attack missions. These in turn began to be replaced by the S.E.5a in December 1917, which were flown for the rest of the war on fighter and ground attack missions. On 1 April 1918, the squadrons became part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF). In March 1919, the squadron returned to the United Kingdom as a cadre, and disbanded on 29 December 1919. During the war, sixteen aces had served in its ranks. They included: future Air Marshal Arthur Coningham; Walter Tyrrell; Arthur Claydon; John Donaldson; Wilfred Green; Frank Hale; Hubert Jones; William Curphey; Maxmillian Mare-Montembault; and George Lawson.

===Inter-war years===
No. 32 Squadron reformed on 1 April 1923 at RAF Kenley as a single flight of Sopwith Snipe fighters. A second flight was formed on 10 December 1923, and a third brought the squadron up to strength on 1 June 1924. Gloster Grebes were received at the end of 1924, and were replaced by Gloster Gamecocks two years later. Equipped in succession with Armstrong Whitworth Siskins, Bristol Bulldogs, and Gloster Gauntlets, the squadron received the Hawker Hurricane I in October 1938.

===Second World War===
In May 1940, the squadron flew patrols over northern France, and took part in the defence of south-east England, based at RAF Biggin Hill, but operating daily from their forward airfield at RAF Hawkinge, near Folkestone, during the opening weeks of the Battle of Britain. The squadron moved to northern England at the end of August 1940. The squadron&#x27;s Hurricanes saw little action throughout 1941, but did attempt, unsuccessfully, to escort the Fairey Swordfish biplanes of 825 Naval Air Squadron during their doomed attempt to stop the German warships , , and during the Channel Dash on 12 February 1942. They then carried out a number of night intruder operations before being deployed overseas.

Following Operation Torch, the Anglo-American invasion of North Africa, in December 1942, the squadron deployed with its Hurricanes to Algeria, converting to the Supermarine Spitfire by July 1943. Operations included a deployment to Greece, where it took part in the Greek Civil War from September 1944 to February 1945.

===Post-war===

After the end of the Second World War, the squadron continued as a fighter unit, flying Spitfires, the de Havilland Vampire, and de Havilland Venom, from bases in Palestine, Cyprus, Egypt, Persian Gulf, Malta, and Jordan. In January 1957, the squadron converted to the English Electric Canberra B.2 bombers at RAF Weston Zoyland, flying these from Cyprus, remaining there until disbanding on 3 February 1969.

===VIP transport===
The Metropolitan Communications Squadron was formed on 8 April 1944 for VIP air transport by the renaming of No. 510 Squadron. Simultaneous with No.32 Squadron being disbanded in Cyprus in February 1969, the Metropolitan Communications Squadron was renamed No. 32 Squadron. It operated a variety of aircraft, including Hawker Siddeley Andover CC.2s and Westland Whirlwind HC.10 helicopters.

32 Squadron acquired four Hawker Siddeley HS.125 CC1 (military aircraft registration numbers XW788 to XW791) business jets in 1971, these were Viper powered -400B series. These would be supplemented and then replaced by two HS.125 CC2 (-600B version, XX507 and XX508) delivered in 1973, and six BAe 125 CC3 (Garrett-powered -700B version) delivered in 1982 and 1983 (ZD620, ZD621, ZD703, ZD704, ZE395, ZE396). Aérospatiale Gazelle helicopters served with the squadron from 1976 onwards. These were replaced by initially two (later three) Eurocopter Twin Squirrels in 1996.

The RAF leased two BAe 146 in 1983 (designated BAe 146 CC1) as a test of their suitability to replace the Andover, which were operated by No. 241 Operational Conversion Unit. Two BAe 146-100 (designated BAe 146 CC2) were purchased in 1984 for the Queen&#x27;s Flight as a result, with delivery in 1986. A third BAe 146 CC2 was purchased in 1989 and delivered in 1990, although it was subsequently sold in 2002. The BAe 146 provided a 60% increase in range compared with the Andover, and a larger interior capacity for more passengers.
On 1 April 1995, the Queen&#x27;s Flight, equipped with these BAe 146 CC2, and Westland Wessex HCC.4 helicopters (the latter operated from 1969 until 1998), was merged into No. 32 Squadron, to become No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron, and moved to RAF Northolt from RAF Benson. Since then, No. 32 Squadron&#x27;s aircraft have served as transports in several recent conflicts, including Operation Granby (&#x27;Gulf War&#x27;), Operation Veritas (&#x27;Afghanistan&#x27;), and Operation Telic (&#x27;Iraq 2003&#x27;). This merger ended the RAF&#x27;s provision of dedicated VIP transport aircraft: the aircraft of No. 32 Squadron are available to VIP passengers only if not needed for military operations. This was declared officially in 1999, with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) stating: &quot;the principal purpose of 32 Squadron [is] to provide communications and logistical support to military operations; the Squadron&#x27;s capacity should be based on military needs only; and any royal or other non-military use of ... spare capacity is secondary to its military purpose&quot;.
Following a review by the MOD, in 2004, the squadron&#x27;s aircraft lost their distinctive livery inherited from The Queen&#x27;s Flight, featuring red flying surfaces. This was due to the concern over the aircraft&#x27;s vulnerability to terrorist attack, to make the aircraft look more &#x27;civilian&#x27;.

In May 2005, the Defence Logistics Organisation&#x27;s (DLO) Helicopter and Islander Combined (HIC) Integrated Project Team (IPT) awarded AgustaWestland a five-year contract from 1 April 2006 to provide three AgustaWestland AW109E to replace the three Twin Squirrels. This contract was extended on 31 March 2011, to allow two of the AW109E to continue in use for a further year. Two preserved examples of the squadron&#x27;s Westland Wessex HCC.4 helicopters, originally operated by the Queen&#x27;s Flight, can be seen at The Helicopter Museum located at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and the Royal Air Force Museum London (XV732) at Hendon, north London.

Two additional BAe 146 were purchased in March 2012 from TNT Airways, and were refitted by Hawker Beechcraft on behalf of BAE Systems for tactical freight and personnel transport use. The aircraft, designated as the BAe 146 C3, arrived in Afghanistan in April 2013. On 16 March 2015, the squadron&#x27;s final BAe 125 returned from operations in Afghanistan, and the type&#x27;s retirement from the RAF was brought forward due to defence budget cuts. Of the final four operational aircraft, three were put up for sale by the Ministry of Defence, and one (ZD621) was placed on permanent display as a gate guardian at RAF Northolt. The decision was made that the aircraft were to be retired from service seven years ahead of their original withdrawal date.

On 30 November 2015, a single AgustaWestland AW109SP GrandNew (military aircraft registration number GZ100) was delivered to the squadron to replace the unit&#x27;s earlier AW109E (ZR322), which was withdrawn the following year.

On 11 October 2017, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) announced that Her Majesty The Queen had approved the award of Battle Honours &#x27;Iraq 2003–2011&#x27; and &#x27;Libya 2011&#x27;, both without the right to emblazon, to the squadron.

In 2020, the squadron&#x27;s two BAe 146 C3 were modified for use in the medical support role, to carry patients and medical personnel into and out of smaller airfields than the RAF&#x27;s Voyager multi-role tanker transport aircraft.

The Integrated Review saw the fleet of four BAe 146 retired in March 2022. Shortly before, in February 2022, Defence Equipment and Support (DES) announced that the four aircraft would be replaced by two Dassault Falcon 900LX.

One of the BAe 146-100s (ZE701) has been retired to the British Airliner Collection at Duxford, Cambridgeshire, the other (ZE700) joined South Wales Aviation Museum (SWAM) at St Athan in March 2022. The two BAe 146-200s (ZE707 and ZE708) have also been removed from service and sold to civilian airline Pionair Australia.

In August 2023, it was announced that the Rotary Wing Command Support Air Transport contract, which provides the Squadron&#x27;s AgustaWestland AW109SP GrandNew, would not be renewed and would end on 30 September 2023. The Ministry of Defence later confirmed that the contract had been extended. The new Labour government subsequently cancelled the extension of the contract in August 2024, with effect from December 2024.

<text>William Tennant (16 May 1784 – 14 October 1848) was a Scottish scholar and poet.

==Life==
He was born at Anstruther, Fife.

He was lame from childhood. His father sent him to the University of St Andrews, where he remained for two years, and on his return he became clerk to one of his brothers, a corn factor. In his leisure time he mastered Hebrew as well as German and Italian.

His study of Italian verse bore fruit in the mock-heroic poem of &quot;Anster Fair&quot; (1812), which gave an amusing account of the marriage of &quot;Maggie Lauder,&quot; the heroine of the popular Scottish ballad. It was written in the &quot;ottava rima&quot; adopted a few years later by &quot;the ingenious brothers Whistlecraft&quot; (John Hookham Frere), and turned to such brilliant account by Byron in &quot;Don Juan&quot;. The poem, unhackneyed in form, full of fantastic classical allusions applied to the simple story, and brimming over with humour, had an immediate success. It is said to be the first use of this Italian style in Britain.
He was a member of the Anstruther Musimanik Society, a literary society.

Tennant&#x27;s brother, meanwhile, had failed in business, and the poet became in 1812 schoolmaster of the parish of Dunino, near St Andrews. From this he was promoted (1816) to the school at Lasswade, near Edinburgh; from that (1819) to a mastership in Dollar Academy; from that (1834), by Lord Jeffrey, to the professorship of oriental languages (having mastered Hebrew, Arabic and Persian by this stage) at the University of St Andrews. 
&quot;The Thane of Fife&quot; (1822), shows the same humorous imagination as &quot;Anster Fair&quot;, but the subject was more remote from general interest, and the poem fell flat.

He also wrote a poem in Lowland Scots, &quot;Papistry Stormed&quot; (1827); two historical dramas, &quot;Cardinal Beaton&quot; (1823) and &quot;John Balliol&quot; (1825); and a series of &quot;Hebrew Dramas&quot; (1845), founded on incidents in Bible history.

He died at Devon Grove, on 14 February 1848.

Tennant&#x27;s plays proved to be disappointing and unsuccessful:
:&quot;The public now wondered, and well it might, that the rich promise given in &quot;Anster Fair&quot; had been so poorly redeemed. What had become of that ungovernable wit that had burst its bounds, and overflowed in such profusion? A single stanza of Rob the Ranter was worth fifty Baliols and Beatons to boot. Fortunately for Tennant’s character as a poet, his retirement from the stage was calm and graceful.&quot;

A &quot;Memoir&quot; of Tennant by MF Connolly was published in 1861.

<text>Big Brother and the Holding Company are an American rock band that was formed in San Francisco in 1965 as part of the same psychedelic music scene that produced the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Jefferson Airplane. After some initial personnel changes, the band became well known with the lineup of vocalist Janis Joplin, guitarists Sam Andrew and James Gurley, bassist Peter Albin, and drummer Dave Getz. Their second album &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;, released in 1968, is considered one of the masterpieces of the psychedelic sound of San Francisco; it reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and was ranked number 338 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album is also listed in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Joplin left the band in 1968, following the recording of &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;, for a successful solo career. The band recruited as new members Nick Gravenites, Kathi McDonald, and Dave Schallock to replace her, and released two more albums before breaking up in 1972. The classic lineup (minus Joplin, who had died in 1970) reunited in 1987. The band has continued to perform ever since, with a variety of different lead singers. James Gurley left for a solo career in 1997 and died in 2009. Sam Andrew died in 2015.

==History==
===Roots in San Francisco===
Leader Peter Albin, a country and blues guitarist who had played with future Grateful Dead&#x27;s founders Jerry Garcia and Ron McKernan, met Sam Andrew, a professional rock guitarist with a jazz and classical background. After playing together at Albin&#x27;s home, Andrew suggested they could form a band. The pair approached guitarist James Gurley, and the resulting trio played open jam sessions hosted by entrepreneur Chet Helms in 1965. Helms found them a drummer, Chuck Jones, and &quot;Big Brother and the Holding Company&quot; was formed at their first gig, the Trips Festival in January 1966. In the audience there was painter and jazz drummer David Getz, who soon replaced Jones.

Big Brother went on to become the house band at the Avalon Ballroom, playing a progressive style of instrumental rock. Feeling a need for a strong vocalist, Helms contacted Janis Joplin, who at the time was considering joining up with Roky Erickson of The 13th Floor Elevators. She traveled to San Francisco from Austin, Texas and debuted with Big Brother at the Avalon on June 10, 1966.

===Janis Joplin===
Joplin sang for the first time with Big Brother in 1966. Years later, Andrew described the band&#x27;s first impressions of her:

It took a while for some of the band&#x27;s followers to accept the new singer, whose musical style differed from the experimental and unconventional sound that Big Brother played at the time. With the addition of Joplin, they became more disciplined musicians, their songs adopted a more traditional structure, and the band started to increase its popularity in the San Francisco psychedelic scene.

===Mainstream Records debut===
In September 1966, the band was stranded in Chicago after finishing a gig at a venue called Mother Blues located on Wells Street. The venue&#x27;s owner paid them for two weeks&#x27; worth of concerts but it was not enough to buy plane tickets back to San Francisco. While there, Big Brother signed a contract with Mainstream Records and attempted to record four songs for a debut album eventually released as &quot;Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company&quot;, although these initial sessions proved unsatisfactory. When they returned to California in October two songs were recorded in Los Angeles, while the remainder of the record was recorded there from December 12–14, produced by Mainstream&#x27;s owner Bob Shad. Mainstream was known for its jazz records, and Big Brother was the first rock band to appear on the label. This may have influenced the final result, since the album sounded very different from what the band expected: the acid-rock guitar distortion and lengthy jams typical of their stage act were completely absent, replaced by clean, low-key instrumental tones and tight, two minute song lengths. 

&quot;Blind Man&quot; b/w &quot;All Is Loneliness&quot;, both from the early sessions in Los Angeles, became the group&#x27;s first single in October 1966. It was popular in the San Francisco Bay Area, but did not garner any national attention. A second single, &quot;Down on Me&quot; b/w &quot;Call On Me&quot; was released in March 1967, with &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; following along with the album in August after the band&#x27;s national success at the Monterey Pop Festival. The album debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on September 2, 1967, peaking at No. 60. It stayed on the charts for a total of 30 weeks.

The &quot;Pop Chronicles&quot; criticized the record as difficult to find and &quot;technically disappointing&quot;. &quot;Down On Me&quot; had a long gestation in the marketplace and finally debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on August 31, 1968, peaking at No. 43. It stayed on the charts for 8 weeks. Other singles from the album were released through the end of 1967 and in 1968. &quot;Coo Coo&quot; b/w &quot;The Last Time&quot;, was released in January, 1968. These last songs were from the original 1966 album sessions, but were not included on the LP until Columbia acquired all of the band&#x27;s Mainstream recordings and reissued the album in the 1970s.

In the summer of 1966, the band members moved to Lagunitas, in Marin County, California, to a house that had been originally built by the ethnologist Clinton Hart Merriam. They lived in there until the beginning of 1967 at which time they put an ad in the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot; with the apparent intention of moving back to the &quot;City&quot;. The ad read: &quot;Big Brother is returning to the city. Need rehearsal hall and a place to live. Write to B.B.&amp; the H.C. at Box 94 Lagunitas.&quot; On October 6 they performed a set at the Love Pageant Rally, the first outdoor Haight-Ashbury festival held on the same day LSD was made illegal in California. 

===Mantra-Rock Dance===

One of the band&#x27;s earliest major performances in 1967 was the Mantra-Rock Dance—a musical event held on January 29, 1967, at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. Big Brother and Janis Joplin performed there along with Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami, Allen Ginsberg, Moby Grape, and Grateful Dead, donating proceeds to the Krishna temple.

===Monterey Pop Festival===
The band&#x27;s historic performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967 attracted national and international attention. The band was scheduled to play on Saturday afternoon, with a set which included &quot;Down on Me&quot;, &quot;Combination of The Two&quot;, &quot;Harry&quot;, &quot;Roadblock&quot; and &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;. However, the band&#x27;s manager decided not to allow Pennebaker&#x27;s film crew to film and record them without paying them, and ordered the crew to turn its cameras off. The festival promoters thought the band performance was great, and asked them to play again the next evening in order to record it on film, but they played only two songs: &quot;Combination of The Two&quot; and &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;. &quot;I remember being amazed that this white woman was singing like Bessie Smith,&quot; said Michelle Phillips once. &quot;I was astounded&quot;. They signed a contract with Columbia Records, which was able to buy out their contract from Mainstream. In late November, Albert Grossman, who was then managing Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul and Mary and several other acts became their manager.

===National success===
Having received national recognition after the Monterey Pop Festival, Big Brother was booked by Grossman for engagements around the country. One of those engagements was for opening night at Chet Helm&#x27;s The Family Dog Denver on September 8 &amp; 9, 1967 along with Blue Cheer. A well-known band on the West Coast (especially in San Francisco), Big Brother played their first East Coast concert in New York City on February 17, 1968, at the Anderson Theater, 66 Second Avenue. Columbia&#x27;s marketing department featured Janis Joplin as the star; before that time, some of the band&#x27;s audience regarded James Gurley as of equal or more importance. In New York the press criticized the band for playing out of tune and for amplifiers set at maximum volume. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, while noting that “ears came out ringing” after the Saturday night performance, cited Joplin as ranking in sex appeal with Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix, and praised “her belting, groovy style,” mixing Bessie Smith, Aretha Franklin and James Brown. “At times she seemed to be singing harmony with herself.” Big Brother was the first band to play in the legendary Fillmore East, in New York City, on March 8, 1968. The other acts that night were Albert King and Tim Buckley.

===&quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;===

The band&#x27;s first album for Columbia was due to be recorded during the spring and summer of 1968, and released in August of that year. It was eagerly anticipated after the first LP had been largely ignored. Initially planned as a live album, the band recorded two concerts at Grande Ballroom in Detroit, but the results did not satisfy the producer John Simon nor the manager Albert Grossman.

The live album was scrapped and Columbia decided to re-record most of the songs in the studio (&quot;Down on Me&quot; and &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, taken from the Grande Ballroom concerts, were later released as part of Joplin&#x27;s live album &quot;In Concert&quot; in 1972). However, it was difficult adapting their raw sound and unorthodox work habits with the realities of a professional studio. The progress was slow, and the pressure from Grossman, Columbia, and the press increased. A few of the band members believed that John Simon should not be the producer, believing that he came from a different musical style and did not understand the band&#x27;s psychedelic, guitar based sound.

The album was initially named &quot;Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills&quot;, but Columbia asked them to shorten it to just &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;. For the album cover the band was photographed by Richard Avedon but the pictures were not used. Also rejected was a photo of the band naked in a hotel room bed. Dave Getz suggested that the band hire underground comic-book artist R. Crumb whom he knew through a mutual friend. What was originally meant to be the back cover art became the classic cover of the album. For the back cover, Columbia chose a black and white photo of Joplin.

&quot;Ball and Chain&quot; is the only song on the album recorded entirely live, and even though the cover credits assert that the live material was recorded at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium, it was actually taken from a concert in Winterland Ballroom in 1968, the same version that appears on the album &quot;Live at Winterland &#x27;68&quot;, released in 1998. (The performance of &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; as released on the &quot;Winterland&quot; album features a different opening guitar solo by Gurley, indicating that he had dubbed a different intro for the &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; issue.)

The LP was released in August 1968, one year after their debut album, and reached number one on the Billboard charts in its eighth week in October. It held the number one spot for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks, and the single &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot; also became a huge hit. By the end of the year it was one of the most successful albums of 1968. It was certified gold by the R.I.A.A. on October 15 that year for $1 million worth of sales, with subsequent sales pushing the total over a million units. Even though the album was released with only seven songs, the other eight songs which were not included were released on subsequent albums. &quot;Catch Me Daddy&quot; and &quot;Farewell Song&quot; were among their most popular songs. These plus &quot;Magic of Love&quot;, a medley of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and &quot;Hi-Heel Sneakers&quot;, and an outtake of &quot;Harry&quot; first appeared on &quot;Farewell Song&quot;, a posthumous Joplin release in 1981; they also appeared on the three-CD set &quot;Janis&quot; in 1993. &quot;It&#x27;s a Deal&quot; and &quot;Easy Once you Know How&quot; were released in &quot;Box of Pearls&quot; in 1999. &quot;Flower in The Sun&quot; and &quot;Roadblock&quot; were released on the &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; reissue CD as bonus tracks. &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot; would be reissued on a single in the Columbia Hall of Fame oldies series - backed by the title cut from Joplin&#x27;s first 1969 solo album, &quot;I Got Dem Ol&#x27; Kozmic Blues Again Mama!&quot;.

===Split with Joplin===
At the end of the summer of 1968, just after the release of &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;, Joplin announced that she was leaving Big Brother in the fall of that year. The official reason given was her desire to go solo and form a soul music band. Andrew also planned to leave the band to join Joplin in her new project. Joplin played with Big Brother on a nationwide tour throughout October and November 1968. It included an October 20 concert at a roller rink in Alexandria, Virginia. Their final concert was in San Francisco on December 1, 1968. It was a benefit for the production company known as the Family Dog whose members included Chet Helms, the band&#x27;s manager from two years earlier. Three weeks after this benefit concert, Joplin and Andrew played in Memphis for the first time with her new band, later called Kozmic Blues Band.

===1969–1972===
After Joplin and Sam Andrew left Big Brother, Dave Getz and Peter Albin joined Country Joe and the Fish and toured the U.S. and Europe and played on the Country Joe album &quot;Here We Are Again&quot; (Vanguard Records 1969). Getz and Albin left Country Joe in May 1969 with the intention of re-forming Big Brother with guitarist David Nelson. They auditioned several singers including Eddie Money, Kathi McDonald and John Herald, but the band finally came back together when Sam Andrew left the Kozmic Blues Band in the fall of 1969 with nearly the same line-up (except Joplin): Albin, Andrew, Getz and Gurley were joined by Nick Gravenites (vocals), Dave Schallock (guitar) and Kathi McDonald (vocals). They released &quot;Be a Brother&quot; in 1970. Gurley moved to bass guitar while Albin played rhythm, Sam Andrew sang more lead vocals with Kathi McDonald (a white blues singer who had been with the Ike and Tina Turner review), David Schallock (from Freedom Highway and Sons of Champlin) on lead guitar, Dave Getz on drums and occasional keyboards. Nick Gravenites would also produce the album, write and sing on a number of the tracks. They released their last studio album, &quot;How Hard It Is&quot;, in 1971. They retained the same lineup: Kathi and Sam and Nick on vocals joined by organist Mike Finnigan. The band remained with this line-up until 1972, but they gradually fell apart and disbanded amidst drug use, loss of management, lack of gigs and internal squabbles. They re-united once to play &quot;The Tribal Stomp&quot; in 1978 at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley.

===1987–present===

The latest incarnation began in 1987, and has been touring part-time ever since with most of its classic line-up; including Sam Andrew, Peter Albin, Dave Getz, and James Gurley. Gurley left in 1997 because he did not support his colleagues&#x27; idea to hire a female singer to replace Joplin. He was replaced by Tom Finch. Big Brother did not have a fixed lead singer until 2011; Michel Bastian, Lisa Battle, Halley DeVestern, Lisa Mills, Jane Kitto (Aus), Andra Mitrovich, Kacee Clanton, Sophia Ramos, Mary Bridget Davies, Duffy Bishop, Lana Spence, Chloe Lowery, Jane Myrenget, Lynn Asher, Kate Russo Thompson, Darby Gould, Maria Stanford, Jeri Verdi, and Superfly&#x27;s Shiho Ochi were among the singers that have played in concerts with them. Cathy Richardson became the band&#x27;s official lead singer in 2011, with Ben Nieves having replaced Finch as guitarist in 2008. Other guitarists performed and toured with Big Brother including Chad Quist, Joel Hoekstra, and even Kate Russo Thompson on electric violin as 2nd guitarist. In 1999 the band released the album &quot;Do What You Love&quot;, with Lisa Battle as the lead singer. The album contains some new versions of songs like &quot;Women is Loser&quot;. They recorded the live album &quot;Hold Me&quot;, with Sophia Ramos on lead vocals and Chad Quist on guitar, in Germany in 2005, and released it in 2006. In 2008 they released the two-CD set &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot;, with songs recorded at concerts between 1966 and 1967 in San Francisco, and featuring Janis Joplin as lead singer. Some songs had already been unofficial releases, but there are 12 never-before-released songs.

Former guitarist James Gurley died on December 20, 2009, of a heart attack, just two days before his 70th birthday. Sam Andrew died on February 12, 2015, following complications from open-heart surgery due to a heart attack suffered ten weeks prior.

In October 2016, the band went to Europe for a short tour in the Netherlands, with the following line-up: Dave Getz on drums, Peter Albin on bass, Tom Finch on guitar, Kate Russo on electric violin, keyboards and vocals, and Eileen Humphreys on lead vocals. Venues included the North Sea Jazz Club in Amsterdam, De Bosuil in Weert, Het Paard in The Hague and Luxor Live in Arnhem. &quot;Big Brother And The Holding Co Live In The Lowlands&quot; was released in 2017 on DVD and CD by Marista Records featuring this lineup in Weert.

==Controversy==
In 2007, following the induction of &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; to the Grammy Hall of Fame, former guitar player James Gurley described Big Brother as the most maligned band ever, since they never received appreciation for the arrangements they did and all the engineering tricks he came up with. Gurley also believed that Clive Davis told Joplin to leave the band and record her songs with studio musicians, who could play better. In the documentary &quot;Nine Hundred Nights&quot;, Peter Albin said that the manager Albert Grossman told Joplin to leave Big Brother and form her own band, with studio musicians, in order to spend less money on recording sessions. Sam Andrew said later that Joplin left due to artistic and financial reasons: Joplin usually asked the band to have some keyboard or horns on at least some songs, but they said, &quot;No! You are going to change the Big Brother sound!&quot; The band was also doing the same songs a lot, sometimes three times a day, so she started feeling trapped. The band was splitting the money in five equal ways, while by leaving she could have all the money and just pay some employees and have a new band.

In 1982, Columbia released the Janis Joplin album &quot;Farewell Song&quot;. The release displeased Big Brother&#x27;s living members, since their original instruments were all replaced by studio musicians without consulting the band. James Gurley spoke about that in 1987, before the band&#x27;s reunion: &quot;It’s just a total bullshit record...some producer&#x27;s dream at CBS.&quot;

<doc id="610714" wikidata="Q1349627" url="?curid=610714" title="Kirk Franklin">
<text>Kirk Dewayne Franklin (born January 26, 1970) is an American gospel musician. He is best known for leading urban contemporary gospel ensembles such as The Family, God&#x27;s Property, and One Nation Crew (1NC). One of the best-selling gospel music artists, his accolades include 20 Grammy Awards. &quot;Variety&quot; dubbed Franklin as a &quot;Reigning King of Urban Gospel&quot;, and is one of the inaugural inductees into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

== Early life ==
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Franklin was raised by his aunt, Gertrude, having been abandoned as a baby by his mother. Gertrude recycled aluminum cans to raise money for Kirk to take piano lessons from the age of four. Kirk excelled and was able to read and write music while also playing by ear.

At the age of seven, Franklin received his first contract which his aunt turned down. He did join the church choir and became music director of the Mt. Rose Baptist Church adult choir at 11 years of age.

In his teenage years, Franklin rebelled against his strict religious upbringing, and in an attempt to keep him out of trouble, his grandmother arranged an audition for him at a professional youth conservatory associated with a local university. He was accepted, but later he had to deal with a girlfriend&#x27;s pregnancy and his eventual expulsion from school for bad behavior.

Franklin studied music with Jewell Kelly and the Singing Chaparrals at Oscar Dean Wyatt High School. He continued under her tutelage and ultimately became the pianist for the choir.

When he was aged 15 he witnessed the death of a friend by shooting, after which Franklin returned to the church, where he again directed the choir. He also co-founded a gospel group, &quot;The Humble Hearts&quot;, which recorded one of Franklin&#x27;s compositions and got the attention of gospel music legend Milton Biggham, musical director of the Georgia Mass Choir. Impressed, Biggham enlisted him to lead the DFW Mass Choir in a recording of Franklin&#x27;s song &quot;Every Day with Jesus&quot;. This led to Biggham hiring Franklin, just 20 years old at the time, to lead the choir at the 1990 Gospel Music Workshop of America Convention, an industry gathering.

== Career ==
=== With groups (1992–2000) ===

In 1992, Franklin organized &quot;The Family&quot;, which was a 17-voice choir, formed from neighborhood friends and associates. In 1992, Vicki Mack-Lataillade, the co-founder of fledgling GospoCentric Records label, heard one of their demo tapes and was so impressed she immediately signed up Kirk &amp; The Family to a recording contract.

In 1993, the group, now known as &quot;Kirk Franklin &amp; The Family&quot;, released their debut album, &quot;Kirk Franklin &amp; The Family&quot;. It spent almost two years on the gospel music charts and charted on the R&amp;B charts, eventually earning platinum sales status. It remained at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Gospel Albums chart for 42 weeks. It was only the third gospel music album to sell over a million units after Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans&#x27; &quot;Addictive Love&quot;.

Two years later, after releasing a 1995 Christmas album entitled &quot;Kirk Franklin &amp; the Family Christmas&quot;, the group released &quot;Whatcha Lookin&#x27; 4&quot; in 1996. The album was certified platinum and earned Franklin his first Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album. 

In 1996, Franklin&#x27;s song &quot;Joy&quot; was recorded by Whitney Houston and the Georgia Mass Choir. With production by Houston and Mervyn Warren, the composition was included on the best-selling gospel album of all time, soundtrack to &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife.&quot;

GospoCentric&#x27;s new sub-label, B&#x27;Rite, in partnership with Interscope Records brought another album in 1997, a collaboration with the vocal ensemble God&#x27;s Property, aptly named &quot;God&#x27;s Property from Kirk Franklin&#x27;s Nu Nation&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Stomp&quot;, featuring Cheryl &quot;Salt&quot; James (of Salt-N-Pepa), was a crossover hit, enjoying heavy rotation on MTV and other music channels and charting at No. 1 on the R&amp;B Singles Airplay chart for two weeks, even making it into the Top 40. &quot;God&#x27;s Property from Kirk Franklin&#x27;s Nu Nation&quot; was No. 1 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for five weeks, No. 3 on the Billboard 200, and would go on to be certified 3× platinum by the RIAA. It also brought Franklin another Grammy for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album, as well as three Grammy nominations.

Kelly, Mary J. Blige and Bono of U2 together with Crystal Lewis and The Family. &quot;Lean on Me&quot; and the second single &quot;Revolution&quot; (featuring Rodney Jerkins) were considerable hits, and the album contained a version of a Bill Withers song &quot;Gonna Be a Lovely Day&quot;. &quot;The Nu Nation Project&quot; went on to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Contemporary Christian Albums chart for 23 weeks and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Gospel Albums chart for 49 weeks, and brought Franklin his third Grammy.

Also in 1998, Franklin had made a guest appearance on the hit television sitcom &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;.

On November 2, 1998, God&#x27;s Property sued Franklin. The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges that Franklin induced God&#x27;s Property founder Linda Searight into signing an &quot;onerous and one-sided&quot; contract with B-Rite Music.

In 1999, Kirk Franklin disbanded the Family, after the acclaimed, The Nu Nation Tour. 

In 2000, a select amount of The Family filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit for royalties for their work on &quot;The Nu Nation Project&quot; against Franklin and GospoCentric Records. The album was recorded prior to the lawsuit.

<doc id="610722" wikidata="Q170496" url="?curid=610722" title="Coat of arms of Poland">
<text>The coat of arms of Poland is the heraldic symbol representing Poland. The current version was adopted in 1990. It is a white, crowned eagle with a golden beak and talons, on a red background.

In Poland, the coat of arms as a whole is referred to as &quot;godło&quot; both in official documents and colloquial speech, despite the fact that other coats of arms are usually called a &quot;herb&quot; (e.g. the Nałęcz &quot;herb&quot; or the coat of arms of Finland). This stems from the fact that in Polish heraldry, the word &quot;godło&quot; (plural: &quot;godła&quot;) means only a heraldic charge (in this particular case a white crowned eagle) and not an entire coat of arms, but it is also an archaic word for a national symbol of any sort. In later legislation only the &quot;herb&quot; retained this designation; it is unknown why.

== Legal basis ==
The coat of arms of the Republic of Poland is described in two legal documents: the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of 1997 and the Coat of Arms, Colors and Anthem of the Republic of Poland, and State Seals Act (&quot;Ustawa o godle, barwach i hymnie Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz o pieczęciach państwowych&quot;) of 1980 with subsequent amendments (henceforth referred to as &quot;the Coat of Arms Act&quot;).

The Crown was restored on December 31, 1989 by the Act of December 29, 1989 amending the Constitution of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic (Article 1, point 19). However, the new emblem design was introduced only on February 22, 1990, by the Act of February 9, 1990 amending the provisions on the coat of arms, colors and anthem of the Republic of Poland.

Legislation concerning the national symbols is far from perfect. The Coat of Arms Act has been amended several times and refers extensively to executive ordinances, some of which have never been issued. Moreover, the Act contains errors, omissions and inconsistencies which make the law confusing, open to various interpretations and often not followed in practice.

== Design ==

According to Chapter I, Article 28, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, the coat of arms of Poland is an image of a crowned white eagle in a red field. The Coat of Arms Act, Article 4, further specifies that the crown, as well as the eagle&#x27;s beak and talons, are golden. The eagle&#x27;s wings are outstretched and its head is turned to its right. In English heraldic terminology, the arms are blazoned as &quot;Gules an eagle crowned, beaked and armed Or&quot;. In contrast to classic heraldry, where the same blazon may be rendered into varying designs, the Coat of Arms Act allows only one official rendering of the national coat of arms. The official design may be found in attachment no. 1 to the Coat of Arms Act.

The nearly circular charge, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the image of the white eagle, is highly stylized. The heraldic bird is depicted with its wings and legs outstretched, its head turned to the right, in a pose known in heraldry as &#x27;displayed&#x27;. The eagle&#x27;s plumage, as well as its tongue and leg scales are white with gradient shading suggestive of a bas-relief. Each wing is adorned with a curved band extending from the bird&#x27;s torso to the upper edge of the wing, terminating in a heraldic cinquefoil (a stylized five-leafed plant). Three of its leaves are embossed like a trefoil (note similar trefoils in the medieval designs of the eagle). In heraldic terms, the eagle is &quot;armed&quot;, that is to say, its beak and talons are rendered in gold, in contrast to the body. The crown on the eagle&#x27;s head consists of a base and three fleurons extending from it. The base is adorned with three roughly rectangular gemstones. The fleuronsof which the two outer ones are only partly visiblehave the shape of a fleur-de-lis. The entire crown, including the gems, as well as spaces between the fleurons, is rendered in gold.

The charge is placed in an escutcheon (shield) of the Modern French type. It is a nearly rectangular upright isosceles trapezoid, rounded at the bottom, whose upper base is slightly longer than the lower one, from the middle of which extends downwards a pointed tip. Although the shield is an integral part of the coat of arms, Polish law stipulates, in certain cases, to only use the charge without the escutcheon. The shades of the principal tinctures, white (Argent) and red (Gules), which are the national colors of Poland, are specified as coordinates in the CIE 1976 color space (see Flag of PolandNational colors for details).

== History ==
According to legend, the White Eagle emblem originated when Poland&#x27;s legendary founder Lech saw a white eagle&#x27;s nest. When he looked at the bird, a ray of sunshine from the red setting sun fell on its wings, so they appeared tipped with gold, the rest of the eagle was pure white. He was delighted and decided to settle there and placed the eagle on his emblem. He also named the place Gniezdno (currently Gniezno) from the Polish word &quot;gniazdo&quot; (&quot;nest&quot;).


The symbol of an eagle appeared for the first time on the coins made during the reign of Bolesław I (992–1025), initially as the coat of arms of the Piast dynasty. Beginning in the 12th century, the eagle has appeared on the shields, ensigns, coins, and seals of the Piast dukes. It appeared on the Polish coat of arms during Przemysł II reign as a reminder of the Piast tradition before the fragmentation of Poland.

The eagle&#x27;s graphic form has changed throughout centuries. Its recent shape, accepted in 1927, was designed by professor Zygmunt Kamiński and was based on the eagle&#x27;s form from the times of Stefan Batory&#x27;s reign. It was adapted to stamps or round shields rather than to a rectangular shape.

The arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was quartered, with Polish eagle and Lithuanian Pogonia on opposite sides. Kings used to place their own emblems in escutcheon point (i.e., House Vasa).

Despite the fact that new emblems were given to provinces established by the invaders after the partitions of Poland, the White Eagle remained there with or without crown and occasionally with face turned towards left and in some exceptions with Pogonia. But in most cases they were combined with the invader&#x27;s emblem.

The Poles conscientiously collected coins from the pre-partitions period with the eagle on their obverse and reverse. The symbol of the eagle, often with Pogonia, appeared on numerous flags and emblems of the November Uprising.

The resurrection of the Polish Kingdom (Polish Regency) in the territories of the former Congress Poland (which had been partitioned and annexed by the Russian Empire as the Vistula Land in 1867) was approved by Austria-Hungary and Wilhelm II&#x27;s Germany in 1916. A year later, the first Polish banknotes (Polish Marka) with Crowned Eagle on an indivisible shield were introduced. After regaining total independence and the creation of the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939) the White Eagle was implemented by the act of 1919. The official image of the coat of arms (which resembled the emblem of Stanislaus Augustus) was redesigned in 1927 by Zygmunt Kamiński. This design was introduced by law on 13 December of that year before coming into effect on 29 March 1928. According to the research of Polish heraldist Jerzy Michta published in 2017, the version designed by Kamiński was actually plagiarized from a 1924 medal by Elisa Beetz-Charpentier made in honor of Ignacy Paderewski.

After World War II, the communist authorities of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic removed the crown from the eagle&#x27;s head. Still, Poland was one of the few countries in the Eastern Bloc with no communist symbols (red stars, ears of wheat, hammers, etc.) on either its flag or its coat of arms. The crownless design was approved by resolution in 1955. To counter that, the Polish government in exile introduced a new emblem with a cross added atop the crown. After the fall of communism in 1989, the coat of arms was swiftly redesigned by Andrzej Heidrich using the Kamiński&#x27;s design as a basis. The modifications include the removal of the yellow border around the shield and changing the cinquefoils that adorned the upper edges of the eagle&#x27;s wings from resembling stars to be in the shape of a trefoil. The crown was also returned to the eagle&#x27;s head. The redesigned coat of arms was adopted by law on 22 February 1990.

The eagle appears on many public administration buildings, it is present in schools and courts. Furthermore, it is placed on the obverse of Polish coins. However the issue on which conditions it should be exposed and how it should be interpreted is the topic of numerous debates in Poland. The eagle was formerly on the Poland national football team&#x27;s shirts; a new shirt without the eagle was introduced in November 2011, prompting complaints from fans and president Bronisław Komorowski. Due to this overwhelming public pressure, the football shirts were redesigned with the eagle reinstated in the centre of the shirt in December 2011.

=== Evolution ===

====Kings of Poland====
====Restored Poland====
====Communist Poland====
Used since 1944 and legalized in 1952, the emblem of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic was valid until February 21, 1990. In addition to the lack of a crown and other rosettes, there is a significant deformation of the eagle&#x27;s head and eye compared to the pre-war eagle.

====Third Polish Republic====
The current version of the Emblem is consistent with the Act of February 22, 1990. Significant modifications by Andrzej Heidrich are visible compared to the pre-war eagle created by Zygmunt Kamiński.

<text>Max Keith (1903 –1974 , pronounced &quot;kait&quot;) was a German businessman who was the head of Coca-Cola GmbH, the major bottler of Coca-Cola in Nazi Germany.

Keith began working at the German subsidiary of Coca-Cola in 1933, at the age of 30. Between then and 1939, the sales of Coca-Cola in Germany (led by American Ray Rivington Powers) rose from 100,000 cases in 1933 to over 4 million cases just before the outbreak of the Second World War. Following Powers&#x27; death in 1938, Keith took over the subsidiary. After the outbreak of the war, Keith worked with the German bureaucracy, and was appointed to the &quot;Office of Enemy Property&quot;, hence avoiding nationalization of the subsidiary.

Coca-Cola GmbH was unable to obtain Coca-Cola syrup during World War II, because of the Allied blockade. The supply of regular Coca-Cola ran out in 1942, having been reserved primarily to wounded soldiers in hospitals. To keep the plant in operation, Keith developed a fruit flavored drink made from apple fiber, left over from cider pressings, and whey, a byproduct from cheese manufacture, creating Fanta. The drink sold three million cases in 1943, sustaining the firm&#x27;s business in Germany. In 1945, at the last stages of the war, Keith was ordered by a German general to rename the subsidiary but he refused, and the general was killed in an air raid before any action was taken against Keith.

A street in Essen, the site of Coca Cola Germany&#x27;s former headquarters, is named after him.

<text>The Paston Letters are a collection of correspondence between members of the Paston family of Norfolk gentry and others connected with them in England between the years 1422 and 1509. The collection also includes state papers and other important documents.

The letters are a noted primary source for information about life in England during the Wars of the Roses and the early Tudor period. They are also of interest to linguists and historians of the English language, being written during the Great Vowel Shift, and documenting the transition from Late Middle English to Early Modern English.

== History of the collection ==
The large collection of letters and papers was acquired in 1735 from the executors of the estate of William Paston, 2nd Earl of Yarmouth, the last in the Paston line, by the antiquary Francis Blomefield. On Blomefield&#x27;s death in 1752 they came into the possession of Thomas Martin of Palgrave, Suffolk. On his death in 1771 some letters passed into the hands of John Ives, while many others were purchased by John Worth, a chemist at Diss, whose executors sold them in 1774 to Sir John Fenn of East Dereham.

==Published editions==

===Edited by John Fenn===
In 1787 John Fenn published a selection of the letters in two volumes, bringing general interest to the collection. Fenn published two further volumes of letters in 1789. Before he died in 1794 he prepared a fifth volume for publication, which was posthumously published in 1823 by his nephew William Frere. In 1787 Fenn presented the originals of his first two volumes to King George III, who knighted Fenn on 23 May 1787. Shortly thereafter, the manuscripts for all five volumes disappeared , casting doubt on the authenticity of the letters. In 1865 their authenticity was questioned by Herman Merivale in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;, but James Gairdner countered that they were genuine in the same periodical. Within a year, Gairdner was proven right by the discovery of the originals of the fifth volume, together with other letters and papers, by Frere&#x27;s son, Philip Frere, in his house at Dungate. Ten years later the originals of Fenn&#x27;s third and fourth volumes, with ninety-five unpublished letters, were found at Roydon Hall, Norfolk, the seat of George Frere. Finally the originals of the two remaining volumes were rediscovered in 1889 at Orwell Park, Ipswich, in the residence of Captain E. G. Pretyman. The last letters to be found were the letters presented to George III; they may have reached Orwell through Sir George Pretyman Tomline, the tutor and friend of William Pitt the Younger.

Most of the Paston letters and associated documents are now in the British Library, but some are in the Bodleian Library, Oxford at Magdalen College, with a few at Pembroke College, Cambridge.

===Edited by James Gairdner===
Fenn&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Paston Letters&quot; was considered definitive until 1872, when James Gairdner published the first volume of a new edition. Taking Fenn&#x27;s work as a basis, Gairdner ultimately published over four hundred previously unpublished letters in three volumes. Gairdner&#x27;s edition included notes and an index, and introductions to each volume containing a survey of the reign of King Henry VI. Before he had published all the volumes of his edition, some letters that he had written about were discovered in 1875 at Roydon. These unpublished letters were added as a supplement to a subsequent three-volume edition published in 1896. In 1904 Gairdner edited a complete edition of the &quot;Paston Letters&quot; in six volumes, containing 1,088 letters and papers with a new introduction.

==Biographies of Paston family==
Two recent books have presented the story of the fifteenth-century Pastons for a wider audience, &quot;A Medieval Family&quot; by Frances and Joseph Gies (1998) and &quot;Blood and Roses&quot; by Helen Castor (2004).

==Chronology==

===The early Pastons===
The family of Paston takes its name from a Norfolk village about twenty miles (32 km) north of Norwich. The first member of the family about whom anything is known is Clement Paston (d.1419), a yeoman holding and cultivating about one hundred acres (40 hectares) of land. His wife, Beatrice Somerton (d.1409), is said to have been &#x27;a bond woman&#x27;, but her brother, Geoffrey Somerton (d.1416), became a lawyer, and it was Geoffrey who paid for the education, both at grammar school and at the Inns of Court, of his nephew, William Paston (1378–1444), son of Clement and Beatrice. William, who is described as a &quot;right cunning man&quot; in the law, attained an influential position in his profession, and in 1429 became a Justice of the Common Pleas. He bought a good deal of land in Norfolk, including property in Paston and Gresham Castle, and improved his social position by his marriage with Agnes Barry (d.1479), the daughter and coheir of Sir Edmund Barry or Berry of Horwellbury, near Therfield and Royston, Hertfordshire. Agnes emerges from the letters as a difficult and quick-tempered woman, whose quarrels with the Paston villagers leave some valuable examples of colloquial English in the 1450s. She frequently quarrelled with her children.

On his death, William left a large and valuable inheritance to John Paston, the eldest of his four sons, who was already married to Margaret (d. 1484), daughter of John Mautby of Mautby, Norfolk. England was experiencing instability at this time; the nobles surrounding the king did not allow him sufficient power to govern, and much of England was effectively lawless. A lawyer like his father, John Paston spent much of his time in London, leaving his wife to look after his business in Norfolk, a task which Margaret, a sensible and competent woman, managed with considerable skill. Many of the letters were written by Margaret to her husband in London. The letters written during the lifetimes of John Paston and his eldest son, also named John, are most numerous and provide the most insight, not only on their family matters but on the overall history of England.

In 1448, Paston&#x27;s manor of Gresham was seized by Robert Hungerford, Lord Moleyns (1431–1464), and, although it was afterwards recovered, the owner could obtain no redress for the loss and injury he had sustained. Moreover, Paston had become intimate with the wealthy knight Sir John Fastolf, who was a kinsman of Paston&#x27;s wife, Margaret, and who had employed him on several matters.

At his death, Fastolf left his affairs in disorder. As was customary in his time, he left many of his estates in Norfolk and Suffolk to feoffees including Sir William Yelverton, John Paston and his brother William, retaining the revenues for himself. His written will tasked his ten executors with founding a college at Caister. However, two days before his death, according to John Paston, Fastolf made a nuncupative (spoken) will in which he bequeathed all his lands in Norfolk and Suffolk to Paston, for a payment of 4,000 marks and the duty of founding the college at Caister.

Taking possession of the lands, Paston&#x27;s claims were challenged: several noblemen claimed the estates. The excluded executors litigated, and Paston fell under the threat of violence. A feud broke out between John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, and the Pastons under Margaret and her eldest son, John, around Drayton and Hellesdon. Caister Castle was seized by John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, while similar occurrences took place at other estates. In 1460 and 1461, Paston returned to parliament as a knight of the shire for Norfolk, and, enjoying the favour of Edward IV, had regained his castle at Caister. He fell out of favour, however, and was imprisoned on three occasions. Paston died in May 1466, with the suit concerning Fastolf&#x27;s will still proceeding in the church courts.

===John and Margaret Paston&#x27;s sons and descendants===
John and Margaret Paston left five sons and two daughters. The eldest, Sir John Paston (1442–1479), had been knighted during his father&#x27;s lifetime. He was frequently at the court of Edward IV, but afterwards favoured the Lancastrian party, and, with his younger brother, also named John, fought for Henry VI at the Battle of Barnet. Meanwhile, the struggle over Paston&#x27;s estates continued, although in 1461 the king and council had declared that Paston&#x27;s ancestors were not bondmen, and consequently that his title to his father&#x27;s lands was valid. Caister Castle was taken after a siege by John Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk (1444–1476), and then recovered by the Pastons, and retaken by the duke. But in 1474 an arrangement was made with William Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, the representative of the excluded executors, by which some of the estates were surrendered to the bishop for charitable purposes, while Paston was secured in the possession of others. Two years later the death of the Duke of Norfolk made the restoration of Caister Castle possible, but in 1478 a quarrel broke out with John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk.

Sir John Paston, who was a cultured man, was anxious to recover Caister, but he left the task to his mother and to the younger John. Owing to his carelessness and extravagance, the family lands were also diminished by sales, but nevertheless when he died unmarried in November 1479 he left a substantial inheritance to his younger brother John. Although he didn&#x27;t marry he did have an illegitimate daughter, Constance, who is mentioned in his mother&#x27;s will. About this time the Letters become scanty and less interesting, but the family continued to flourish. The younger John Paston (d. 1504), after quarrelling with his uncle William over the manors of Oxnead and Marlingford, was knighted at the Battle of Stoke in 1487. He married Margery, daughter of Sir Thomas Brewes, and left a son, William Paston (c. 1479–1554), who was also knighted, and who was a prominent figure at the court of Henry VIII. Sir William&#x27;s second son, John Paston (1510–1575) was the father-in-law of Sir Edward Coke. Sir William&#x27;s third son, Clement (c. 1515–1597), served his country with distinction on the sea, and was wounded at the Battle of Pinkie.

The family was continued by Sir William&#x27;s eldest son, Erasmus (b. 1502-d. 1540), whose son William succeeded to his grandfather&#x27;s estates in 1554, and to those of his uncle Clement in 1597. This William (1528–1610) was knighted in 1578. He was the founder of the Paston Grammar School at North Walsham, and made Oxnead Hall, near Norwich, his principal residence. Christopher Paston was Sir William&#x27;s son and heir, and Christopher&#x27;s grandson, William (d. 1663), was created a baronet in 1642; being succeeded in the title by his son Robert (1631–1683), who was a member of parliament from 1661 to 1673, and was created Earl of Yarmouth in 1679. Robert&#x27;s son William (1652–1732), who married a natural daughter of Charles II, was the second earl, and, like his father, was in high favour with the Stuarts. When he died in 1732 he left no son, and his titles became extinct, his estates being sold to discharge his debts.

==Legacy==
The disorder revealed by the &quot;Paston Letters&quot; reflects the general condition of England during this period. The weakness of the government left every branch of the administration disorganized. The succession to the crown itself was contested. Nobility fought a civil war. The prevailing discontent led to the rising of Jack Cade and of the Wars of the Roses. The correspondence reveals the Pastons in a variety of relations to their neighbours – both friendly and hostile. It abounds with illustrations of public events, as well as of the manners and morals of the time, and some valuable examples of colloquial English, such as Agnes Paston&#x27;s quarrel with her neighbour, Warren Harman, c.1451, where she told him &quot;if his father had do as he did he would a be ashamed to say to me as he said&quot;. Particularly remarkable is the habitual acquaintance of educated persons, both men and women, with the law, which was evidently indispensable to persons of substance. Of most interest, however, are the occasional love letters, notably those from Richard Calle to Margery Paston, and Margery Brews&#x27; famous Valentines to John Paston III.

In 2019 a small brass memorial plaque, 25 by 8 cm (9 by 3 inches), was found hidden away between two large tombs in Oxnead church near Aylsham in Norfolk, with an inscription in Latin that translates as &quot;Here lies Anna, daughter of John Paston Knight, on whose soul God have mercy, Amen&quot;. The style of the plaque dated it to between 1490 and 1510, and it is of a type used to memorialise a young girl. The discovery was a surprise, finding an unknown member of the &quot;most researched family&quot; of medieval England. The discovery was made as part of the three-year Paston Footprints project, described as &quot;an introduction and way in to the amazing hub of links, information, people and places which over six centuries have formed the web based on the Paston Letters&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
The letters were adapted by Australian writer Barbara Jefferis as a radio feature and novel &quot;Beloved Lady&quot;; the novel was also serialised as a radio drama.

&quot;The Paston Letters&quot; were Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s main source for &quot;The Black Arrow&quot;.

The early Paston women are the subject of two Anne O&#x27;Brien novels: &quot;The Royal Game&quot; and &quot;A Marriage of Fortune&quot;.

<doc id="610732" wikidata="Q610320" url="?curid=610732" title="Lords of Appeal in Ordinary">
<text>Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, commonly known as Law Lords, were judges appointed under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 to the British House of Lords, as a committee of the House, effectively to exercise the judicial functions of the House of Lords, which included acting as the highest appellate court for most domestic matters.

On 1 October 2009, the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 was repealed owing to the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The House of Lords thus lost its judicial functions and the power to create law life peers lapsed, although the validity of extant life peerages created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 remains intact. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who were in office on 1 October 2009 automatically became Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. At the same time, those Supreme Court justices who already held seats in the House of Lords lost their right to speak and vote there until after retirement as Justices of the Supreme Court.

== Background ==
The House of Lords historically had jurisdiction to hear appeals from the lower courts. Theoretically, the appeals were to the King (or Queen) in Parliament, but the House of Commons did not participate in judicial matters. The House of Lords did not necessarily include judges, but it was formerly attended by several judges who gave their opinions when the Lords desired. They did not, however, have the power to vote in the House. 

In January 1856, to permit legally qualified members to exercise the House&#x27;s appellate functions without allowing their heirs to swell the size of the House, Sir James Parke, a judge, was created a life peer as &quot;Baron Wensleydale&quot;. As the House of Lords eventually decided that a peerage &quot;for the term of his natural life&quot; did not allow him to sit and vote, Parke also received a hereditary peerage on 23 July 1856.

In 1873 William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s government passed the Judicature Act 1873, which reorganised the court system and abolished the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords in respect of English appeals. In February 1874, before the Act came into force, Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal Government fell. The Conservative Benjamin Disraeli became prime minister. In 1874 and 1875 Acts were passed delaying the coming into force of the Judicature Act 1873. The Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 repealed the provisions rescinding the jurisdiction of the House of Lords. Additionally, the Act provided for the appointment of two persons to be Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who were to sit in the House of Lords under the dignity of baron. Originally, though they held the rank of baron for life, they served in Parliament only while holding judicial office. In 1889, however, an Act was passed allowing Lords of Appeal to continue to sit and vote in Parliament even after retirement from office.

The last person to be made a law lord under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 was Sir Brian Kerr on 29 June 2009. On 1 October 2009, the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 was repealed by Schedule 18 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 owing to the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. As a result, the power to create life peers under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 lapsed, although the validity of peerages created thereunder remains intact.

==Qualifications and functions==

===Qualifications of candidates for appointment===
To be appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary under the 1876 Act, a person was required to have been a practising barrister for a period of fifteen years or to have held a high judicial office—as Lord Chancellor (before 2005) or judge of the Court of Appeal, High Court or Court of Session—for a period of two years. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were required to retire from judicial office at 70 or 75 years of age, though as barons they continued to serve as members of the House of Lords in its legislative capacity for life.

===Letters patent appointing Lords of Appeal in Ordinary ===
While letters patent issued by the Monarch under the terms of the Life Peerages Act 1958 just name the recipient of the life peerage, letters patent issued under the terms of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 also name the retired Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in whose stead the recipient is appointed. In the final form used in 2009, these read: 
Elizabeth the Second by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Our other Realms and Territories Queen Head of the Commonwealth Defender of the Faith / To whom these Presents shall come Greeting / Whereas Our [&quot;name of retired Lord of Appeal in Ordinary&quot;] has resigned his Office of a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and the same is now vacant Now Know Ye that We of Our especial grace have in pursuance of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 as amended by subsequent enactments nominated and appointed and by these Presents Do nominate and appoint Our [&quot;name of the new appointee&quot;] to be a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary by the style of [&quot;full peerage title of the new appointee&quot;] to hold the said Office so long as he shall well behave himself therein subject to the provisions in the said Act mentioned with all wages profits privileges rank and precedence whatsoever to the said Office belonging or in anywise appertaining and to hold the said style of Baron unto him the said [&quot;name of the new appointee&quot;] during his life / In Witness whereof We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patent / Witness Ourself at Westminster the [&quot;day&quot;] day of [&quot;month&quot;] in the [&quot;year&quot;] Year of Our Reign. 

===Retirement age of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary ===
The statutory retirement age for Lords of Appeal in Ordinary depended on when they were first appointed to judicial office: for those who first became a judge before 31 March 1995, the retirement age is 75 years of age; for those appointed on or after that date, retirement was at 70 years of age (though they were permitted to continue sitting in a part-time capacity as a &quot;Lord of Appeal&quot; until the age of 75 years). There have been recent suggestions that the retirement age for the United Kingdom&#x27;s most senior judges should revert to 75 years of age.

=== Number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary ===
The Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 originally provided for the appointment of two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who would continue to serve while holding judicial office, though in 1887, they were permitted to continue to sit in the House of Lords for life, with the style and dignity of baron. The number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was increased incrementally over the years—to three in 1882, to four in 1891, to six in 1913, to seven in 1929, to nine in 1947, to eleven in 1968 and to twelve in 1994. The Administration of Justice Act 1968 allowed the Sovereign to make a statutory instrument, if each House of Parliament passed a resolution approving a draft of the same, increasing the maximum number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.

=== Remuneration ===
Of all members of the House of Lords, only Lords of Appeal in Ordinary ever received state salaries by virtue of their position (other Lords have only ever received a daily allowance for attending sittings, plus expenses of attendance). In 2004, the salary for the Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary was £185,705, and for other Lords of Appeal in Ordinary it was £179,431.

== Lords of Appeal ==

In exercising the judicial functions of the House of Lords, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were sometimes joined by other Lords of Appeal. Lords of Appeal included holders or former holders of high judicial office who were members of the House of Lords, but not by virtue of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act (e.g. life peers under the Life Peerages Act 1958). The Lords of Appeal continue to hold the style for life.

===Senior and Second Senior Law Lord===

The two most senior Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were designated the Senior and Second Senior Lords of Appeal in Ordinary respectively. The Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary historically was the Law Lord who was senior by virtue of having served in the House for the longest period. With the appointment of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in 2000, however, it became an appointed position.

The Second Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary became the peer who had served for the longest period. Lord Hope of Craighead succeeded to this position on Lord Hoffmann&#x27;s retirement on 20 April 2009.

<doc id="610733" wikidata="Q164158" url="?curid=610733" title="Amelanchier alnifolia">
<text>Amelanchier alnifolia, the saskatoon berry, Pacific serviceberry, western serviceberry, western shadbush, or western juneberry, is a shrub native to North America. It is a member of the rose family, and bears an edible berry-like fruit.

==Description==
It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that most often grows to , rarely to , in height. Its growth form spans from suckering and forming colonies to clumped. The leaves are oval to nearly circular, long and broad, on a leaf stem, with margins toothed mostly above the middle.

As with all species in the genus &quot;Amelanchier&quot;, the flowers are white, with five quite separate petals and five sepals. In &quot;A. alnifolia&quot;, they are about across, with 20 stamens and five styles, appearing on short racemes of 3–20, somewhat crowded together, blooming from April to July.

The fruit is a small purple pome in diameter, ripening in early summer. It has a waxy bloom. Saskatoon species can be relatively difficult to distinguish.
===Chemistry===
Saskatoons have total polyphenol content of 452 milligrams per 100 grams (average of &#x27;Smoky&#x27; and &#x27;Northline&#x27; cultivars), flavonols (61 mg) and anthocyanins (178 mg), although others have found the phenolic values to be either lower in the &#x27;Smoky&#x27; cultivar or higher. Quercetin, cyanidin, delphinidin, pelargonidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin were present in saskatoon berries.

==Taxonomy==

=== Varieties ===
The three varieties are:
*&quot;A. a.&quot; var. &quot;alnifolia&quot;. Northeastern part of the species&#x27; range.
*&quot;A. a.&quot; var. &quot;pumila&quot; (Nutt.) A.Nelson. Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada.
*&quot;A. a.&quot; var. &quot;semiintegrifolia&quot; (Hook.) C.L.Hitchc. Pacific coastal regions, Alaska to northwestern California.

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;saskatoon&quot; derives from the Cree inanimate noun ( , &#x27;saskatoonberry&#x27;, &#x27;saskatoonberries&#x27;).

The specific epithet &quot;alnifolia&quot; is a feminine adjective. It is a compound of the Latin word for &quot;alder&quot;, , and the word for &quot;leaf&quot;, .

Historically, it was also called pigeon berry.

&quot;Service berry&quot; appears to be a name applied by European immigrants who found it similar in appearance to the European &quot;service tree&quot; plants of genus &quot;Sorbus&quot; and &quot;Cormus&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The plant can be found from Alaska across most of western Canada and in the western and north-central United States. It grows from sea level in the north of the range, up to elevation in California and in the Rocky Mountains. It is a common shrub in the forest understory, as well as canyons.

==Ecology==

&quot;A. alnifolia&quot; is susceptible to cedar-apple rust, &quot;Entomosporium&quot; leaf spot, fireblight, brown rot, &quot;Cytospora&quot; canker, powdery mildew, and blackleaf. Problem insects include aphids, thrips, mites, bud moths, saskatoon sawflies, and pear slug sawflies. It is also a larval host to the pale tiger swallowtail, two-tailed swallowtail, and the western tiger swallowtail.

The foliage is browsed by deer, elk, rabbits, and livestock. The fruit are eaten by wildlife including birds, squirrels, and bears.

==Cultivation==

Seedlings are planted with between rows and between plants. An individual bush may bear fruit 30 or more years.

Saskatoons are adaptable to most soil types with exception of poorly drained or heavy clay soils lacking organic matter. Shallow soils should be avoided, especially if the water table is high or erratic. Winter hardiness is exceptional, but frost can damage blooms as late as May. Large amounts of sunshine are needed for fruit ripening.
==Uses==
===Nutrition===

Saskatoon berries contain significant amounts of total dietary fiber, riboflavin and biotin, and the dietary minerals, iron and manganese, a nutrient profile similar to the content of blueberries.

===Culinary===

With a sweet, nutty taste, the fruits have long been eaten by Indigenous peoples in Canada, fresh or dried. They are well known as an ingredient in pemmican, a preparation of dried meat to which saskatoon berries are added as flavour and preservative. They are used in saskatoon berry pie, jam, wine, cider, beers, and sugar-infused berries similar to dried cranberries used for breakfast cereals, trail mix, and snack foods.

In 2004, the British Food Standards Agency suspended saskatoon berries from retail sales pending safety testing; the ban eventually was lifted after pressure from the European Union.

==In culture==
The city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is named after the berry; the city is also home to a baseball team called the Saskatoon Berries.

<text>Israel is believed to possess weapons of mass destruction, and to be one of four nuclear-armed countries not recognized as a Nuclear Weapons State by the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The US Congress Office of Technology Assessment has recorded Israel as a country generally reported as having undeclared chemical warfare capabilities, and an offensive biological warfare program. Officially, Israel neither confirms nor denies possessing nuclear weapons.

==Nuclear weapons==

It is believed that Israel possessed an operational nuclear weapons capability by 1967, with the mass production of nuclear warheads occurring immediately after the Six-Day War. Experts estimated the stockpile of Israeli nuclear weapons range from 60 to as many as 400. It is unknown if Israel&#x27;s reported thermonuclear weapons are in the megaton range. Israel is also reported to possess a wide range of different systems, including neutron bombs, tactical nuclear weapons, and suitcase nukes. Israel is believed to manufacture its nuclear weapons at the Negev Nuclear Research Center.

On 5 November 2023, amid the 2023 Israel-Hamas War, Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu stated that the use of atomic weapons in the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip could be &quot;one of the possibilities&quot;. He was neither a member the security cabinet nor of the war cabinet, and was subsequently suspended from cabinet meetings.

== Nuclear weapons delivery ==

Nuclear weapons delivery mechanisms include Jericho 3 missiles, with a range of 4,800 km to 6,500 km (though a 2004 source estimated its range at up to 11,500 km), and which are believed to provide a second-strike option, as well as regional coverage from road mobile Jericho 2 IRBMs. Israel&#x27;s nuclear-capable ballistic missiles are believed to be buried so far underground that they would survive a nuclear attack. Additionally, Israel is believed to have an offshore nuclear second-strike capability, using submarine-launched nuclear-capable cruise missiles, which can be launched from the Israeli Navy&#x27;s &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class submarines. The Israeli Air Force has F-15I and F-16I Sufa fighter aircraft which are capable of delivering tactical and strategic nuclear weapons at long distances using conformal fuel tanks and supported by their aerial refueling fleet of modified Boeing 707s.

In 2006, then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert appeared to acknowledge that Israel had nuclear weapons when he stated on German TV that Iran was &quot;aspiring to have nuclear weapons as America, France, Israel, Russia&quot;. This admission was in contrast to the long-running Israeli government policy of deliberate ambiguity on whether it has nuclear weapons. The policy held that Israel would &quot;not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons in the Middle East.&quot; Former International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei regarded Israel as a state possessing nuclear weapons. Much of what is known about Israel&#x27;s nuclear program comes from revelations in 1986 by Mordechai Vanunu, a technician at the Negev Nuclear Research Center who served an 18-year prison sentence as a result. Israel has not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) but supports establishment of a Middle East Zone free of weapons of mass destruction.

==Chemical weapons==
Israel has signed but not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). In 1983 a report by the CIA stated that Israel, after &quot;finding itself surrounded by frontline Arab states with budding CW capabilities, became increasingly conscious of its vulnerability to chemical attack... undertook a program of chemical warfare preparations in both offensive and protective areas... In late 1982 a probable CW nerve agent production facility and a storage facility were identified at the Dimona Sensitive Storage Area in the Negev Desert. Other CW agent production is believed to exist within a well-developed Israeli chemical industry.&quot;

There are also speculations that a chemical weapons program might be located at the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) in Ness Ziona.

190 liters of dimethyl methylphosphonate, a CWC schedule 2 chemical used in the synthesis of sarin nerve gas, was discovered in the cargo of El Al Flight 1862 after it crashed in 1992 en route to Tel Aviv. Israel said the material was non-toxic and was to have been used to test filters that protect against chemical weapons. It had also been listed on the cargo manifest in accordance with international regulations. The shipment was from a U.S. chemical plant to the IIBR under a U.S. Department of Commerce license.

In 1993, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment WMD proliferation assessment recorded Israel as a country generally reported as having undeclared offensive chemical warfare capabilities. Former US deputy assistant secretary of defense responsible for chemical and biological defense Dr. Bill Richardson said in 1998 &quot;I have no doubt that Israel has worked on both chemical and biological offensive things for a long time... There&#x27;s no doubt they&#x27;ve had stuff for years.&quot;

==Biological weapons==
Israel is suspected to have developed an offensive biological warfare capability, per the US Congress Office of Technology Assessment. Israel is not a signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). It is assumed that the Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Ziona develops vaccines and antidotes for chemical and biological warfare. It is generally agreed Israel does not have a stockpile of chemical weapons; it is speculated that Israel retains an active ability to produce and disseminate biological weapons, likely as a result of its extremely complex biodefense program. Israel has taken steps to strengthen its export control regulations on dual-use biotechnologies.
Israel has conducted biological warfare previously, in the 1948 operation Cast Thy Bread.

<text>The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) is a U.S.-based international nonprofit organization devoted to eliminating death, injury, property, and economic loss due to fire, electrical, and related hazards. , the NFPA claims to have 50,000 members and 9,000 volunteers working with the organization through its 250 technical committees.

== History ==

In 1895, a Committee on Automatic Sprinkler Protection was formed in Massachusetts by men affiliated with several fire insurance companies and a pipe manufacturer to develop a uniform standard for the design and installation of fire sprinkler systems. At the time, there were nine such standards in effect within of Boston, Massachusetts, and such diversity was causing great difficulties for plumbers working in the New England region.

The next year, the committee published its initial report on a uniform standard, and went on to form the NFPA in late 1896. The committee&#x27;s initial report evolved into NFPA 13, &quot;Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems,&quot; the most widely used fire sprinkler standard. 

Around 1904, the NFPA began to expand its membership from affiliates of fire insurance companies to many other organizations and individuals, and also expanded its mission beyond promulgating fire sprinkler standards.

In 2024, the Grenfell Tower Inquiry&#x27;s final Phase 2 report noted that the NFPA&#x27;s prescriptive approach to drafting its standards &quot;reflects a conservative approach to fire safety which is embedded in North American culture&quot; and the NFPA standards &quot;allow little scope for independent design choices&quot;. The Inquiry found that it would be inappropriate to transpose the NFPA approach to fire safety into the British context where the functional approach has been prevalent for many decades, but also found that the UK could learn something from the American tradition that those persons &quot;involved in the design, construction and inspection of buildings&quot; must have a license or certification to establish a minimum level of competence in their field.

== Codes and standards ==

The association publishes more than 300 consensus codes and standards intended to minimize the possibility and effects of fire and other risks. The codes and standards are administered by more than 250 technical committees consisting of approximately 9,000 volunteers.

==Mascot==

Sparky the Fire Dog is the official mascot of the National Fire Protection Association. Created in 1951 to promote fire safety education for children, he is a Dalmatian dressed in firefighting gear.

A children&#x27;s book about Sparky by Don Hoffman was published in 2011. He serves as the spokesdog for Fire Prevention Week each October in the United States and Canada.

<text>The Pont Saint-Bénézet (; Provençal: ), also known as the Pont d&#x27;Avignon (), was a medieval bridge across the Rhône in the town of Avignon, in southern France. Only four arches survive.

An early wooden bridge spanning the Rhône between Villeneuve-lès-Avignon and Avignon was built between 1177 and 1185. This wooden bridge was destroyed forty years later in 1226 during the Albigensian Crusade when Louis VIII of France laid siege to Avignon. Beginning in 1234 the bridge was rebuilt with 22 stone arches. The stone bridge was about in length and only in width, including the parapets at the sides. The bridge was abandoned in the mid-17th century as the arches tended to collapse each time the Rhône flooded, making it very expensive to maintain. Four arches and the gatehouse at the Avignon end of the bridge have survived. 

The Chapel of Saint Nicholas which sits on the second pier of the bridge, was constructed in the second half of 12th century but has since been substantially altered. The western terminus, the Tour Philippe-le-Bel, is also preserved.

The bridge was the inspiration for the song &quot;Sur le pont d&#x27;Avignon&quot; and is considered a landmark of the city. In 1995, the surviving arches of the bridge were classified as a World Heritage Site, together with the , Cathédrale Notre-Dame des Doms, and other monuments from the historic centre of Avignon, because of its testimony to Avignon&#x27;s leading role in the Papacy during the 14th and 15th centuries.

==History==
The bridge spanned the Rhône between Avignon and Villeneuve-lès-Avignon. The first bridge was built between 1177 and 1185 but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. Beginning in 1234 the bridge was rebuilt. Historians have suggested that the first bridge would have been either constructed entirely of wood or may have been a wooden superstructure supported on stone piers. Only when rebuilt was the bridge constructed entirely in stone. The stone bridge had 22 arches and 21 piers and a length of some . It did not run directly between the two gatehouses, but instead followed a curved path, probably an adaption to the position of the islands at the time. 

Over the centuries the Rhône has shifted across its floodplain. The position of the islands in the 13th century is not well documented but a 17th-century map shows that the southern end of the Île de la Barthelasse was upstream of the bridge. The bridge crossed small islands that lay upstream of the Île de Piot. The spacing between the piers varied between . The bridge was only in width, including the parapets at the sides. The arches were liable to collapse when the river flooded and were sometimes replaced with temporary wooden structures before being rebuilt in stone.

The bridge fell into a state of disrepair during the 17th century. By 1644 the bridge was missing four arches, and a flood in 1669 swept away more of the structure. Since then, its surviving arches have successively collapsed or been demolished and only four of the arches remain. The only other visible vestige of the bridge is some masonry from pier 11 that is attached to a private building on the Île de la Barthelasse. Remains of other piers are buried under a thick layer of sediment on the island or at the bottom of the Rhône. The locations of piers 9 and 10, both now on the Île de la Barthelasse, were confirmed by cores drilled at their expected positions. Masonry from the piers was reached at a depth of below ground level. Just below the masonry, at a depth of around , wooden fragments, identified as silver fir (&quot;Abies alba&quot;), were recovered. Carbon-14 dating of this material gave dates of 1238–1301 AD for pier 9 and 1213–1280 AD for pier 10 (the range is for 2σ).

The arches are segmental rather than the semi-circular shape typically used in Roman bridges. Of the remaining arches the largest span is between the third and fourth piers. The piers have cutwaters that are pointed both upstream and downstream. These reduce the scour around the piers, one of the main threats to the stability of stone bridges. The piers were constructed with openings in the stone work to reduce the pressure from the flow of water when river was in flood.

With the collapse of the Saint-Bénézet bridge the Rhône at Avignon was crossed by ferry until the beginning of the 19th century. Between 1806 and 1818 a wooden bridge was built across the two branches of the river, a few hundred metres south of the old bridge at the . The section across the Avignon branch of the Rhône was replaced by a suspension bridge in 1843. This was demolished in 1960 with the opening of the Edouard Daladier bridge. The section of the wooden bridge across the Villeneuve branch of the Rhône was not replaced until 1909. The replacement stone bridge, the Nouveau Pont, was damaged by bombing in 1944 during World War II. It was repaired after the war but was replaced by the Pont du Royaume in 1972.

===Saint Bénézet ===
An uneducated shepherd, Bénézet (born c.1165 - died c 1184, feast day 14 April, patron saint of bridge builders) claimed that he was divinely commanded by Jesus in a vision to build the bridge at a point where the force of the Rhône was so great that it had discouraged even Roman engineers in antiquity. The bishop of Avignon, at first skeptical, finally approved the project, and work began in 1177. Bénézet reputedly overcame many obstacles miraculously, and the construction of the bridge was said to have caused 18 miraculous healings. Convinced that the work was ordained by God, wealthy patrons formed the first “Bridge-Building Brotherhood” to fund Bénézet&#x27;s endeavor. He died four years before the bridge was completed and was buried in a chapel built on one of the piers. After almost 500 years his body was removed, and his relics are at Saint-Didier in Avignon.

===Saint Nicholas Chapel===
The Saint Nicholas Chapel sits on a platform on the upstream side of the second pier (between the second and third arches). The bridge chapel has undergone several phases of reconstruction and restoration. It is now divided into two floors, each with a nave and an apse. The upper floor is on a level with the platform of the bridge and reduces the width of the walkway to . The lower floor is accessed by a set of steps that descend from the bridge.

The exterior of the chapel shows evidence of the rebuilding work with blocked windows on the south-eastern wall. The nave is covered with stone roof tiles which rest on a series of corbels. The polygonal apse has a flat roof and sits above the cutwater of the pier.

The lower chapel with its apse decorated with five arches dates from the second half of the 12th century. At a later date, perhaps as early as the 13th century when the level of the bridge was raised, a floor supported by a ribbed quadripartite vault was inserted into the structure. The simple rectangular upper chapel with the barrel vaulted roof was consecrated in 1411. A side door was created in the lower chapel as the stonework of the raised bridge blocked the original entrance. In 1513 a pentagonal apse with gothic columns was added to the upper chapel.

In 1670, after the bridge was abandoned, the relics of Saint Bénézet were transferred to the Hôpital du Pont (also called the Hôpital St Bénézet) within the city walls next to the gatehouse.

The bridge was also the site of devotion by the Rhône boatmen, whose patron saint was Saint Nicholas. They initially worshipped in the Saint Nicholas Chapel on the bridge itself (where Saint Bénézet&#x27;s body was also interred) but the increasing dilapidation of the bridge made access difficult. In 1715 the confraternity of boatmen built a chapel on dry land on the Avignon side of the bridge outside the city walls next to the gatehouse. This chapel was destroyed by the major flood of the Rhône that occurred in 1856. A residence for a caretaker was built on the ruins during the restoration work undertaken beginning around 1878. The residence was demolished as part of the restoration work on the bridge and gatehouse carried out in the 1980s.

===Gatehouses===
The bridge had great strategic importance as when first built it was the only fixed river crossing between Lyon and the Mediterranean Sea. It was also the only river crossing between the Comtat Venaissin, an enclave controlled by the Pope, and France proper under the authority of the kings of France. As such, it was closely guarded on both sides of the river. The right bank, which was controlled by the French crown, was overlooked by the fortress of the Tour Philippe-le-Bel which was built at the beginning of the 14th century. On the Avignon side, a large gatehouse was erected in the 14th century and then extensively modified in the 15th century. The walkway passed over the city wall and down a ramp (now destroyed) which led into the city.

Between 1265 and 1309 another stone bridge was constructed across the Rhône, upstream from Avignon, at what is now Pont-Saint-Esprit but then known as Saint-Saturnin-du-Port. The Pont-Saint-Esprit bridge originally had 20 arches and a length of . Although now somewhat modified, the medieval bridge has survived until the present day.

The Chapel of Saint Nicholas and the four remaining arches were listed as a &quot;Monument historique&quot; in 1840.

===Roman bridge hypothesis===
A scholarly debate has taken place on whether a bridge existed prior to the construction of the Saint Bénézet bridge in the 12th century. An earlier bridge was first proposed by Henri Revoil at the French Archaeological Conference held in Avignon in 1882. His main argument was based on the appearance of the stonework at the base of the four surviving piers. At very low water, stone blocks were visible which were larger than those above and had features that appeared foreign to the existing bridge. The style of the masonry indicated to Revoil that there had been an earlier bridge dating from either the late Roman or Carolingian periods. In 1892 Louis Rochetin published an article suggesting that the projecting stone blocks at the base of the first pier and those on either side of the second pier supporting the chapel were the remains of springers that would have supported earlier Roman arches.

Denis-Marcel Marié, in his book on the bridge self-published in 1953, reviewed all the previous publications and in the final chapter came out in support of the hypothesis that an early bridge had been built by the Gallo-Romans towards the end of the Roman occupation. He suggested that the bases of the surviving piers belonged to this earlier bridge and that the semi-circular arches employed during the Roman period meant that the level of the roadway would have been higher than the top of the surviving chapel. Marié surmised that this early bridge had collapsed over the following seven centuries and the 12th century Bénézet bridge had consisted of a decking supported on wooden piles linking the ruined Roman piers. The piles were necessary because the gaps between the Roman stone piers would have been too large to span with wooden beams without the intervening support. The height of the Bénézet bridge would have been at the level of the lower chapel.

Further support for the existence of a Roman bridge came in an article by Perrot &quot;et al.&quot; published in 1971. The article described a survey undertaken in 1969 on the surviving vestiges of the piers in the Villeneuve branch of the river before their total destruction by the Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR). The article also included long quotes from an unpublished report by Mr Mathian, an engineer working for the CNR, on a survey carried out in 1965 on the four intact piers on the Avignon side of the river. This survey had discovered a layer of wood, at least 20 cm in thickness, under the foundations of each of the four intact piers. A sample of the wood was dated by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) using the radiocarbon technique to between 290 and 530 AD, corresponding to the end of the Roman Empire. In the survey of the ruined piers in the Villeneuve channel, a pier (listed as number 14) was found to contain wooden beams within the masonry. A sample of this wood was radiodated to 890 AD.(error estimates were not specified). During the dredging of the Villeneuve channel the remains of three large wooden piles were recovered, two of which were still shod with iron tips. Samples of wood from these were sent for dating, but at the time of the publication of the article, the results had not been received.

The archaeologist Dominique Carru, while accepting the radiocarbon date for the sample of wood, argued in 1999 that it is very unlikely that an earlier bridge existed. It is not mentioned in the surviving chronicles from the high medieval period and a bridge would have led to the development of an urban centre on the right bank of the Rhône opposite Avignon, similar to those at other locations in the Rhône valley, such as Trinquetaille opposite Arles and Saint-Romain-en-Gal near Vienne. There is no evidence for a significant early settlement near the terminus of the bridge. The main east–west route in the Roman period passed through Tarascon-Beaucaire, to the south, and avoided the river at Avignon which was wide and variable in position.

== The song &quot;Sur le Pont d&#x27;Avignon&quot; ==
The bridge has achieved worldwide fame through its commemoration by the song &quot;Sur le Pont d&#x27;Avignon&quot; (&quot;On the Bridge of Avignon&quot;). An earlier song with the same title was popular in the 16th and 17th centuries. The melody was published by Ottaviano Petrucci in his &quot;Harmonice Musices Odhecaton&quot; of 1503–04. The 16th-century composer Pierre Certon used the melody in a mass with the title of &quot;Sus le Pont d&#x27;Avignon&quot;. The modern version of the song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the opéra comique which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.

<text>In econometrics, the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model is a statistical model for time series data that describes the variance of the current error term or innovation as a function of the actual sizes of the previous time periods&#x27; error terms; often the variance is related to the squares of the previous innovations. The ARCH model is appropriate when the error variance in a time series follows an autoregressive (AR) model; if an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is assumed for the error variance, the model is a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model.

ARCH models are commonly employed in modeling financial time series that exhibit time-varying volatility and volatility clustering, i.e. periods of swings interspersed with periods of relative calm (this is, when the time series exhibits heteroskedasticity). ARCH-type models are sometimes considered to be in the family of stochastic volatility models, although this is strictly incorrect since at time &quot;t&quot; the volatility is completely predetermined (deterministic) given previous values.

==Model specification==

To model a time series using an ARCH process, let formula_1denote the error terms (return residuals, with respect to a mean process), i.e. the series terms. These formula_1 are split into a stochastic piece formula_3 and a time-dependent standard deviation formula_4 characterizing the typical size of the terms so that

:formula_5

The random variable formula_3 is a strong white noise process. The series formula_7 is modeled by

:formula_8,
:where formula_9 and formula_10.

An ARCH(&quot;q&quot;) model can be estimated using ordinary least squares. A method for testing whether the residuals formula_11 exhibit time-varying heteroskedasticity using the Lagrange multiplier test was proposed by Engle (1982). This procedure is as follows:

# Estimate the best fitting autoregressive model AR(&quot;q&quot;) formula_12.
# Obtain the squares of the error formula_13 and regress them on a constant and &quot;q&quot; lagged values:
#: formula_14
#: where &quot;q&quot; is the length of ARCH lags.
#The null hypothesis is that, in the absence of ARCH components, we have formula_15 for all formula_16. The alternative hypothesis is that, in the presence of ARCH components, at least one of the estimated formula_17 coefficients must be significant. In a sample of &quot;T&quot; residuals under the null hypothesis of no ARCH errors, the test statistic &quot;T&#x27;R²&quot; follows formula_18 distribution with &quot;q&quot; degrees of freedom, where formula_19 is the number of equations in the model which fits the residuals vs the lags (i.e. formula_20). If &quot;T&#x27;R²&quot; is greater than the Chi-square table value, we &quot;reject&quot; the null hypothesis and conclude there is an ARCH effect in the ARMA model. If &quot;T&#x27;R²&quot; is smaller than the Chi-square table value, we do not reject the null hypothesis.

==GARCH==

If an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is assumed for the error variance, the model is a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model.

In that case, the GARCH (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) model (where &quot;p&quot; is the order of the GARCH terms formula_21 and &quot;q&quot; is the order of the ARCH terms formula_22 ), following the notation of the original paper, is given by

formula_23

formula_24

formula_25

Generally, when testing for heteroskedasticity in econometric models, the best test is the White test. However, when dealing with time series data, this means to test for ARCH and GARCH errors.

Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is an alternative model in a separate class of exponential smoothing models. As an alternative to GARCH modelling it has some attractive properties such as a greater weight upon more recent observations, but also drawbacks such as an arbitrary decay factor that introduces subjectivity into the estimation.

===GARCH(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) model specification===

The lag length &quot;p&quot; of a GARCH(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) process is established in three steps:

# Estimate the best fitting AR(&quot;q&quot;) model
#: formula_12.
# Compute and plot the autocorrelations of formula_27 by
#: formula_28
# The asymptotic, that is for large samples, standard deviation of formula_29 is formula_30. Individual values that are larger than this indicate GARCH errors. To estimate the total number of lags, use the Ljung–Box test until the value of these are less than, say, 10% significant. The Ljung–Box Q-statistic follows formula_18 distribution with &quot;n&quot; degrees of freedom if the squared residuals formula_32 are uncorrelated. It is recommended to consider up to T/4 values of &quot;n&quot;. The null hypothesis states that there are no ARCH or GARCH errors. Rejecting the null thus means that such errors exist in the conditional variance.

===NGARCH===
====NAGARCH====

Nonlinear Asymmetric GARCH(1,1) (NAGARCH) is a model with the specification:
:formula_33,
:where formula_34 and formula_35, which ensures the non-negativity and stationarity of the variance process.
For stock returns, parameter formula_36 is usually estimated to be positive; in this case, it reflects a phenomenon commonly referred to as the &quot;leverage effect&quot;, signifying that negative returns increase future volatility by a larger amount than positive returns of the same magnitude.

This model should not be confused with the NARCH model, together with the NGARCH extension, introduced by Higgins and Bera in 1992.

===IGARCH===

Integrated Generalized Autoregressive Conditional heteroskedasticity (IGARCH) is a restricted version of the GARCH model, where the persistent parameters sum up to one, and imports a unit root in the GARCH process. The condition for this is

formula_37.

===EGARCH===

The exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (EGARCH) model by Nelson &amp; Cao (1991) is another form of the GARCH model. Formally, an EGARCH(p,q):

formula_38

where formula_39, formula_40 is the conditional variance, formula_41, formula_42, formula_43, formula_44 and formula_45 are coefficients. formula_46 may be a standard normal variable or come from a generalized error distribution. The formulation for formula_47 allows the sign and the magnitude of formula_46 to have separate effects on the volatility. This is particularly useful in an asset pricing context.

Since formula_49 may be negative, there are no sign restrictions for the parameters.

===GARCH-M===

The GARCH-in-mean (GARCH-M) model adds a heteroskedasticity term into the mean equation. It has the specification:

formula_50

The residual formula_51 is defined as:

formula_52

===QGARCH===

The Quadratic GARCH (QGARCH) model by Sentana (1995) is used to model asymmetric effects of positive and negative shocks.

In the example of a GARCH(1,1) model, the residual process formula_53 is

formula_54

where formula_55 is i.i.d. and

formula_56

===GJR-GARCH===

Similar to QGARCH, the Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle GARCH (GJR-GARCH) model by Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle (1993) also models asymmetry in the ARCH process. The suggestion is to model formula_57 where formula_55 is i.i.d., and

formula_59

where formula_60 if formula_61, and formula_62 if formula_63.

===TGARCH model===

The Threshold GARCH (TGARCH) model by Zakoian (1994) is similar to GJR GARCH. The specification is one on conditional standard deviation instead of conditional variance:

formula_64

where formula_65 if formula_66, and formula_67 if formula_68. Likewise, formula_69 if formula_68, and formula_71 if formula_66.

===fGARCH===

Hentschel&#x27;s fGARCH model, also known as Family GARCH, is an omnibus model that nests a variety of other popular symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models including APARCH, GJR, AVGARCH, NGARCH, etc.

===COGARCH===

In 2004, Claudia Klüppelberg, Alexander Lindner and Ross Maller proposed a continuous-time generalization of the discrete-time GARCH(1,1) process. The idea is to start with the GARCH(1,1) model equations

:formula_73
:formula_74

and then to replace the strong white noise process formula_55 by the infinitesimal increments formula_76 of a Lévy process formula_77, and the squared noise process formula_78 by the increments formula_79, where

:formula_80

is the purely discontinuous part of the quadratic variation process of formula_81. The result is the following system of stochastic differential equations:

:formula_82
:formula_83

where the positive parameters formula_84, formula_85 and formula_86 are determined by formula_87, formula_88 and formula_89. Now given some initial condition formula_90, the system above has a pathwise unique solution formula_91 which is then called the continuous-time GARCH (COGARCH) model.

===ZD-GARCH===

Unlike GARCH model, the Zero-Drift GARCH (ZD-GARCH) model by Li, Zhang, Zhu and Ling (2018) lets the drift term formula_92 in the first order GARCH model. The ZD-GARCH model is to model formula_57, where formula_55 is i.i.d., and

formula_95

The ZD-GARCH model does not require formula_96, and hence it nests the Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) model in &quot;RiskMetrics&quot;. Since the drift term formula_92, the ZD-GARCH model is always non-stationary, and its statistical inference methods are quite different from those for the classical GARCH model. Based on the historical data, the parameters formula_98 and formula_99 can be estimated by the generalized QMLE method.

===Spatial GARCH===

Spatial GARCH processes by Otto, Schmid and Garthoff (2018) are considered as the spatial equivalent to the temporal generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models. In contrast to the temporal ARCH model, in which the distribution is known given the full information set for the prior periods, the distribution is not straightforward in the spatial and spatiotemporal setting due to the interdependence between neighboring spatial locations. The spatial model is given by formula_100 and

:formula_101

where formula_102 denotes the formula_103-th spatial location and formula_104 refers to the formula_105-th entry of a spatial weight matrix and formula_106 for formula_107. The spatial weight matrix defines which locations are considered to be adjacent.

==Gaussian process-driven GARCH==
In a different vein, the machine learning community has proposed the use of Gaussian process regression models to obtain a GARCH scheme. This results in a nonparametric modelling scheme, which allows for: (i) advanced robustness to overfitting, since the model marginalises over its parameters to perform inference, under a Bayesian inference rationale; and (ii) capturing highly-nonlinear dependencies without increasing model complexity.

<doc id="610755" wikidata="Q1899406" url="?curid=610755" title="Diyu">
<text>Diyu () is the realm of the dead or &quot;hell&quot; in Chinese mythology. It is loosely based on a combination of the Buddhist concept of Naraka, traditional Chinese beliefs about the afterlife, and a variety of popular expansions and reinterpretations of these two traditions. The concept parallels purgatory in certain Christian denomininations.

Diyu is typically depicted as a subterranean maze with various levels and chambers, to which souls are taken after death to atone for the sins they committed when they were alive. The exact number of levels in Diyu and their associated deities differ between Buddhist and Taoist interpretations. Some speak of three to four &quot;courts&quot;; others mention &quot;Ten Courts of Hell&quot;, each of which is ruled by a judge (collectively known as the Ten Yama Kings); other Chinese legends speak of the &quot;Eighteen Levels of Hell&quot;. Each court deals with a different aspect of atonement and different punishments; most legends claim that sinners are subjected to gruesome tortures until their &quot;deaths&quot;, after which they are restored to their original state for the torture to be repeated.

==Alternative names==
==Conceptions==
According to ideas from Taoism, Buddhism and traditional Chinese folk religion, Diyu is a purgatory that serves to punish and renew spirits in preparation for reincarnation. Many deities, whose names and purposes are the subject of conflicting accounts, are associated with Diyu.

Some early Chinese societies speak of people going to Mount Tai, Jiuyuan, Jiuquan or Fengdu after death. At present, Fengdu and the temples on Mount Tai have been rebuilt into tourist attractions, incorporating artistic depictions of hell and the afterlife. Some Chinese folk religion planchette writings, such as the Taiwanese novel &quot;Journeys to the Under-World&quot;, say that new hells with new punishments (for instance, punishments for sins involving reckless driving) or existing hells with modernized punishments (such as the &quot;Hand-searing Hell&quot; (烙手指小地獄) initially used clothes irons to sear the hands of sinners, but now modernized their punishment by searing the sinners&#x27; hands on iron rails tied with springs) are created as the world changes, the presence of Centre for Making-up of Recitations (補經所) to house priests, monks and taoists who recite scriptures in exchange for material returns but reciting the wrong punctuation or skipped certain scriptures, and that there is a City of Innocent Deaths () designed to house those who died with grievances that have yet to be redressed, such as suicidal, accidental and abortion deaths.

Other terminology related to Diyu includes:

* &quot;Naihe Bridge&quot; (), &quot;Bridge of Helplessness&quot;, a bridge every soul has to cross before being reincarnated, they are said to drink the Mengpo soup (孟婆汤) at Naihe Qiao so they will forget everything in their current lives and prepare for reincarnation.
* &quot;Wang Xiang Tai&quot; (), &quot;Home-Viewing Pavilion&quot;, a pavilion every soul passes by on his/her journey to the Underworld. From there, they can see their families and loved ones in the world of the living.
* &quot;Youdu&quot; (), the capital city of Diyu, generally conceived as being similar to a typical Chinese capital city, such as Chang&#x27;an, but surrounded by and pervaded with darkness.
* &quot;Youguo&quot; (), &quot;Oil Cauldron&quot;, one of the tortures in hell, generally purposed to punish black magic practitioners, murder, corruption, and robbery.
* &quot;Santu&quot; (), the &quot;Three Tortures&quot;: Fire Torture (), Blade Torture (), Blood Torture ().

==Ten Courts of Yanluo==
The concept of the &quot;Ten Courts of Yanluo&quot; () began after Chinese folk religion was influenced by Buddhism. In this variation of Chinese mythology, there are 12,800 hells located under the earth – eight dark hells, eight cold hells and 84,000 miscellaneous hells located at the edge of the universe. All will go to Diyu after death but the period of time one spends in Diyu is not forever – it depends on the severity of the sins one committed (grave sins such as unfilial acts, rape, and debauchery will be sentenced to Avīci forever instead, while sinners involved in pornographic materials production will be sent to various hells and finally to Avīci until all such materials ceased to exist). Prior to be sent to various courts, all will be faced in front of the Mirror Platform (孽鏡臺) to see all their sins reflected during their lifetime. After receiving due punishment, one will eventually be sent for reincarnation. Diyu is divided into ten courts, each overseen by a Yanwang. Souls pass from stage to stage at the decision of a different judge. The &quot;Ten Courts of Yanluo&quot; is also known as the Ten Courts of Yanwang (), Ten Lords of Minggong (), Ten Courts of Yan-jun (), Ten-Lords of Difu (), and Ten-Lords of Mingfu (). 
 


==Eighteen levels of Hell==
The concept of the eighteen hells started in the Tang dynasty. The Buddhist text &quot;Sutra on Questions about Hell&quot; () mentioned 134 worlds of hell, but was simplified to the Eighteen Levels of Hell in the &quot;Sutra on the Eighteen Hells&quot; () for convenience. Some literature refers to eighteen types of hells or to eighteen hells for each type of punishment.

Some religious or literature books say that wrongdoers, regardless of being punished or otherwise when they were alive are punished in the hells after death. Sinners feel pain and agony just like living humans when they are subjected to the tortures listed below. They cannot &quot;die&quot; from the torture because when the ordeal is over, their bodies will be restored to their original states for the torture to be repeated.

The eighteen hells vary from narrative to narrative but some commonly mentioned tortures include: being steamed; being fried in oil cauldrons; being sawed into half; being run over by vehicles; being pounded in a mortar and pestle; being ground in a mill; being crushed by boulders; being made to shed blood by climbing trees or mountains of knives; having sharp objects driven into their bodies; having hooks pierced into their bodies and being hung upside down; drowning in a pool of filthy blood; being left naked in the freezing cold; being set aflame or cast into infernos; being tied naked to a bronze cylinder with a fire lit at its base; being forced to consume boiling liquids; tongue ripping; eye gouging; teeth extraction; heart digging; disembowelment; skinning; being trampled, gored, mauled, eaten, stung, bitten, pecked, etc., by animals such as mice, wasps, maggots, and leeches.

<text>In artificial intelligence, knowledge-based agents draw on a pool of logical sentences to infer conclusions about the world. At the knowledge level, we only need to specify what the agent knows and what its goals are; a logical abstraction separate from details of implementation.

This notion of knowledge level was first introduced by Allen Newell in the 1980s, to have a way to rationalize an agent&#x27;s behavior. The agent takes actions based on knowledge it possesses, in an attempt to reach specific goals. It chooses actions according to the principle of rationality.

Beneath the knowledge level resides the symbol level. Whereas the knowledge level is &quot;world&quot; oriented, namely that it concerns the environment in which the agent operates, the symbol level is &quot;system&quot; oriented, in that it includes the mechanisms the agent has available to operate. The knowledge level &quot;rationalizes&quot; the agent&#x27;s behavior, while the symbol level &quot;mechanizes&quot; the agent&#x27;s behavior.

For example, in a computer program, the knowledge level consists of the information contained in its data structures that it uses to perform certain actions. The symbol level consists of the program&#x27;s algorithms, the data structures themselves, and so on.

<text>Bioacoustics is a cross-disciplinary science that combines biology and acoustics. Usually it refers to the investigation of sound production, dispersion and reception in animals (including humans). This involves neurophysiological and anatomical basis of sound production and detection, and relation of acoustic signals to the medium they disperse through. The findings provide clues about the evolution of acoustic mechanisms, and from that, the evolution of animals that employ them.

In underwater acoustics and fisheries acoustics the term is also used to mean the effect of plants and animals on sound propagated underwater, usually in reference to the use of sonar technology for biomass estimation. The study of substrate-borne vibrations used by animals is considered by some a distinct field called biotremology.

==History==
For a long time humans have employed animal sounds to recognise and find them. Bioacoustics as a scientific discipline was established by the Slovene biologist Ivan Regen who began systematically to study insect sounds. In 1925 he used a special stridulatory device to play in a duet with an insect. Later, he put a male cricket behind a microphone and female crickets in front of a loudspeaker. The females were not moving towards the male but towards the loudspeaker. Regen&#x27;s most important contribution to the field apart from realization that insects also detect airborne sounds was the discovery of tympanal organ&#x27;s function.

Relatively crude electro-mechanical devices available at the time (such as phonographs) allowed only for crude appraisal of signal properties. More accurate measurements were made possible in the second half of the 20th century by advances in electronics and utilization of devices such as oscilloscopes and digital recorders.

The most recent advances in bioacoustics concern the relationships among the animals and their acoustic environment and the impact of anthropogenic noise. Bioacoustic techniques have recently been proposed as a non-destructive method for estimating biodiversity of an area.

== Importance ==
In the terrestrial environment, animals often use light for sensing distance, since light propagates well through air. Underwater sunlight only reaches to tens of meters depth. However, sound propagates readily through water and across considerable distances. Many marine animals can see well, but using hearing for communication, and sensing distance and location. Gauging the relative importance of audition versus vision in animals can be performed by comparing the number of auditory and optic nerves. 

Since the 1950s to 1960s, studies on dolphin echolocation behavior using high frequency click sounds revealed that many different marine mammal species make sounds, which can be used to detect and identify species under water. Much research in bioacoustics has been funded by naval research organizations, as biological sound sources can interfere with military uses underwater.

==Methods==

Listening is still one of the main methods used in bioacoustical research. Little is known about neurophysiological processes that play a role in production, detection and interpretation of sounds in animals, so animal behaviour and the signals themselves are used for gaining insight into these processes. 

Bioacoustics has also helped to pave the way for new emerging methods such as ecoacoustics (or acoustic ecology), an interdisciplinary field of research that studies the sounds produced by ecosystems, including biological, geophysical and anthropogenic sources. It examines how these sounds interact with the environment, providing insights into biodiversity, habitat health and ecological processes. By analysing soundscapes, ecoacoustics helps monitor environmental changes, assess conservation efforts and detect human impacts on natural systems.

===Acoustic signals===

An experienced observer can use animal sounds to recognize a &quot;singing&quot; animal species, its location and condition in nature. Investigation of animal sounds also includes signal recording with electronic recording equipment. Due to the wide range of signal properties and media they propagate through, specialized equipment may be required instead of the usual microphone, such as a hydrophone (for underwater sounds), detectors of ultrasound (very high-frequency sounds) or infrasound (very low-frequency sounds), or a laser vibrometer (substrate-borne vibrational signals). Computers are used for storing and analysis of recorded sounds. Specialized sound-editing software is used for describing and sorting signals according to their intensity, frequency, duration and other parameters.

Animal sound collections, managed by museums of natural history and other institutions, are an important tool for systematic investigation of signals. Many effective automated methods involving signal processing, data mining, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques have been developed to detect and classify the bioacoustic signals.

===Sound production, detection, and use in animals===
Scientists in the field of bioacoustics are interested in anatomy and neurophysiology of organs involved in sound production and detection, including their shape, muscle action, and activity of neuronal networks involved. Of special interest is coding of signals with action potentials in the latter.

But since the methods used for neurophysiological research are still fairly complex and understanding of relevant processes is incomplete, more trivial methods are also used. Especially useful is observation of behavioural responses to acoustic signals. One such response is phonotaxis – directional movement towards the signal source. By observing response to well defined signals in a controlled environment, we can gain insight into signal function, sensitivity of the hearing apparatus, noise filtering capability, etc.

===Biomass estimation===

Biomass estimation is a method of detecting and quantifying fish and other marine organisms using sonar technology. As the sound pulse travels through water it encounters objects that are of different density than the surrounding medium, such as fish, that reflect sound back toward the sound source. These echoes provide information on fish size, location, and abundance. The basic components of the scientific echo sounder hardware function is to transmit the sound, receive, filter and amplify, record, and analyze the echoes. While there are many manufacturers of commercially available &quot;fish-finders,&quot; quantitative analysis requires that measurements be made with calibrated echo sounder equipment, having high signal-to-noise ratios.

==Animal sounds==

Sounds used by animals that fall within the scope of bioacoustics include a wide range of frequencies and media, and are often not &quot;sound&quot; in the narrow sense of the word (i.e. compression waves that propagate through air and are detectable by the human ear). Katydid crickets, for example, communicate by sounds with frequencies higher than 100 kHz, far into the ultrasound range. Lower, but still in ultrasound, are sounds used by bats for echolocation. A segmented marine worm &quot;Leocratides kimuraorum&quot; produces one of the loudest popping sounds in the ocean at 157 dB, frequencies 1–100 kHz, similar to the snapping shrimps. On the other side of the frequency spectrum are low frequency-vibrations, often not detected by hearing organs, but with other, less specialized sense organs. The examples include ground vibrations produced by elephants whose principal frequency component is around 15 Hz, and low- to medium-frequency substrate-borne vibrations used by most insect orders. Many animal sounds, however, do fall within the frequency range detectable by a human ear, between 20 and 20,000 Hz. Mechanisms for sound production and detection are just as diverse as the signals themselves.

==Plant sounds==
In a series of scientific journal articles published between 2013 and 2016, Monica Gagliano of the University of Western Australia extended the science to include plant bioacoustics.

<doc id="610765" wikidata="Q2581024" url="?curid=610765" title="William Waynflete">
<text>William Waynflete (11 August 1486), born William Patten, was Headmaster of Winchester College (1429–1441), Provost of Eton College (1442–1447), Bishop of Winchester (1447–1486) and Lord Chancellor of England (1456–1460). He founded Magdalen College, Oxford, and three subsidiary schools, namely Magdalen College School in Oxford, Magdalen College School, Brackley in Northamptonshire and Wainfleet All Saints in Lincolnshire.

==Early life==
Waynflete was born in Wainfleet in Lincolnshire (whence his surname) in about 1398. He was the eldest son of Richard Patten (alias Barbour), a merchant. His mother was Margery, daughter of Sir William Brereton of Brereton, Cheshire. He had a younger brother named John, who later became the dean of Chichester.

It has been suggested that Waynflete attended Winchester College and New College, Oxford, but this is improbable. Neither college claimed in his lifetime that he was one of its former students. However, that Waynflete was at the University of Oxford, and probably a scholar at one of the grammar schools there, before passing on to the higher faculties, is shown by a letter of the Chancellor addressed to him when Provost of Eton College, which speaks of the university as his mother who brought him forth into the light of knowledge and nourished him with the alimony of all the sciences.

Waynflete is probably the William Barbour who was ordained as an acolyte by Bishop Fleming of Lincoln on 21 April 1420 and subdeacon on 21 January 1421; and as William Barbour, otherwise Waynflete of Spalding, was ordained deacon on 18 March 1421, and priest on 21 January 1426, with entitlement from Spalding Priory.

Waynflete may have been the William Waynflete who was admitted a &quot;scholar&quot; of the King&#x27;s Hall, Cambridge, on 6 March 1428, and was described as LL.B. when receiving letters of protection on 13 July 1429 to enable him to accompany Robert FitzHugh, Warden of the hall, on an embassy to Rome. The &quot;scholars&quot; of the King&#x27;s Hall were what are now called Fellows, as may be seen by the appointment to the hall on 3 April 1360 of Nicholas of Drayton, B.C.L., and John Kent, B.A., in place of two scholars who had gone off to the French wars without the Warden&#x27;s leave. The William Waynflete who was presented to the vicarage of Skendleby, Lincs, by the Priory of Bardney on 14 June 1430, may also have been our Waynflete. There was, however, another William Waynflete, who was instituted rector of Wraxall, Somerset, on 17 May 1433 and was dead when his successor was appointed on 18 November 1436. A successor to the William Waynflete at the King&#x27;s Hall was admitted on 3 April 1434.

==Early career==
In 1429, Waynflete became headmaster of Winchester College, a position which he held until 1441.
During this time, Waynflete was appointed by Bishop Beaufort to the mastership of St Mary Magdalen&#x27;s Hospital, a leper hospital on St Giles Hill, just outside the city of Winchester. The first recorded headmaster after the foundation of the college, John Melton, had been presented by William of Wykeham to the mastership of this hospital in 1393 shortly before his retirement.

On 3 July 1441 Henry VI went for a weekend visit to Winchester College to see the school for himself. Here he seems to have been so much impressed with Waynflete that by the autumn Waynflete had ceased to be headmaster of Winchester. In October he was dining in the hall there as a guest, and at Christmas 1442 he received a royal livery, five yards of violet cloth, as provost of Eton.

Under the influence of Archbishop Chichele (who had himself founded two colleges in imitation of Wykeham); Thomas Bekynton, the king&#x27;s secretary and privy seal; and other Wykehamists, Henry VI, on 11 October 1440, founded, in imitation of Winchester College, a college in the parish church of Eton by Windsor (not far from his own birthplace) called the King&#x27;s College of the Blessed Mary of Eton by Windsor, as a sort of first-fruits of his taking the government on himself. The college was to consist of a provost, 10 priests, 6 choristers, 70 poor and needy scholars, 25 almsmen and a &quot;magister informator&quot; (later &quot;headmaster&quot;) to teach (Latin) grammar to the foundation scholars and to all others coming from any part of England, at no cost. On 5 March 1440/41, the king endowed the college with some £500 a year taken from the alien priories: almost exactly the amount of the original endowment of Winchester.

Though reckoned first headmaster of Eton, there is no definite evidence that Waynflete acted as such. The school building was not begun until May 1442. William Westbury left New College, Oxford in May 1442, transferring himself to the king&#x27;s service. He appears in the first extant &quot;Eton Audit Roll 1444–1445&quot; as &quot;magister informator&quot;, and was probably such from May 1442. If Waynflete was headmaster from October 1441 to May 1442, his duties must have been little more than nominal. As Provost, Waynflete procured the exemption of the college from archidiaconal authority on 2 May, and made the contract for completion of the carpenter&#x27;s work on the eastern side of the quadrangle on 30 November 1443.

On 21 December 1443 Waynflete was sworn to observe the statutes by Bishop Bekynton and the Earl of Suffolk, the king&#x27;s commissioners, and he himself administered the oath to the other members of the foundation: then only five fellows and eleven scholars over 15 years of age. (Younger scholars were not required to take an oath.) It is said that he took half the Fellows and scholars of Winchester College to Eton to start the school there. However, only five scholars and perhaps one commoner (pupil not on the foundation) left Winchester for Eton in 1443, probably in July, just before the election. Three of them were admitted scholars of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge on 19 July. That college, by its second charter of 10 July 1443, had been placed in the same relation to Eton that New College bore to Winchester: i.e. it was to be recruited entirely from Eton.

The chief part of Waynflete&#x27;s duties as Provost was the financing and completion of the buildings and establishment. The number of scholars was considerably increased by an election of 25 new foundation scholars on 26 September 1444. The college&#x27;s annual income was then £946, of which the king contributed £120 and Waynflete £18, or more than half his stipend of £30 a year. The full number of 70 scholars was not filled up until Waynflete&#x27;s last year as Provost, 1446–1447 (&quot;Eton Audit Roll&quot;).

==Bishop of Winchester==
So greatly did Waynflete ingratiate himself with Henry that when Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, Henry&#x27;s uncle, died on 11 April 1447, the king wrote to the chapter of Winchester, instructing them to elect Waynflete as bishop. On 12 April he was given the custody of the temporalities, between 15 and 17 April he was elected, and on 10 May provided to the see by a papal bull. On 13 July 1447 he was consecrated in Eton church, when the Warden and Fellows and others of his old college gave him a horse at a cost of 10 marks (£6 13s 4d), and one mark (13s 4d) to the boys. Subsequent visits to Winchester inspired Henry with the idea of rebuilding Eton church on cathedral dimensions. Waynflete was assigned as the principal executor of his will for that purpose, and if there was any variance between the executors, he was to determine it. From 1448 to 1450 £3336 was spent on the church, of which Waynflete with the Marquis of Suffolk and the Bishop of Salisbury contributed £100 or £1,000 according to interpretation. The troubles which began in 1450 put a stop to the work.

Waynflete, as bishop, lost no time in following the example of Wykeham and his royal patron in becoming a college founder. On 6 May 1448 he obtained licence &quot;in mortmain&quot; and on 20 August founded at Oxford for the extirpation of heresies and errors, the increase of the clerical order and the adornment of holy mother church, a perpetual hall, called Seint Marie Maudeleyn Halle, for study in sacred theology and philosophy, to consist of a president and 50 scholars. Its site was not that of the present college, but that of two earlier halls called Bostar Hall and Hare Hall, where the Examination Schools now are. Thirteen M.A.s and seven bachelors, besides the president, John Hornley, B.D., were named in the charter. The dedication to St Mary Magdalen was no doubt derived from the hospital at Winchester of which the founder had been Master. On St Wolstan&#x27;s Day, 19 January 1448/49, Waynflete was enthroned in Winchester Cathedral in the presence of the king; and, probably partly for his sake, parliament was held there in June and July 1449, when the king frequently attended the college chapel, Waynflete officiating.

When Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion broke out in 1450 Waynflete was employed with Archbishop Stafford, the Chancellor, to negotiate with the rebels at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Southwark, close to Winchester House. A full pardon was promised, but on 1 August Waynflete was one of the special commissioners to try the rebels. On 7 May 1451 Waynflete, from &quot;le chambre&quot; in his manor house at Southwark, asserting that his bishopric was canonically obtained and that he laboured under no disqualification, but feared some grievous attempt against himself and his see, appealed to the protection of the pope. It is suggested that this was due to some disturbances at Winchester where one of Cade&#x27;s quarters was sent after his execution. But it is more likely, that it was some Yorkist attack on him in progress in the papal court. To meet this, he next day appointed 19 proctors to act for him.

In the end result nothing disturbed Waynflete&#x27;s peaceable possession of the see: so that with the archbishop of Canterbury he was able to receive Henry VI when he came to Canterbury on pilgrimage on 2 August 1451. When in November the Duke of York encamped near Dartford, Waynflete with three others was sent from the King&#x27;s camp at Blackheath to propose terms, which were accepted. Edward, Prince of Wales, was born on 13 October 1453 and was baptised by Waynflete the next day. That year Waynflete acquired the reversion of the manor of Stanswick, Berks, from Lady Danvers for Magdalen Hall. The king became insane in 1454. The Chancellor, John Kemp, Archbishop of Canterbury, died during the sitting of parliament, presided over by the Duke of York. Commissioners, headed by Waynflete, were therefore sent to Henry to ask the king to name a new Chancellor, apparently intending that Waynflete should be named. But no answer could be extracted from the king, and after some delay Lord Salisbury took the seals.

During York&#x27;s regency, both before and after the First Battle of St Albans, Waynflete took an active part in the proceedings of the Privy Council. With a view to an ampler site for his college, Waynflete. Retrieved 5 July 1456 a grant of the Hospital of St John the Baptist outside the east gate at Oxford and on 15 July licence to found a college there. Having obtained a papal bull, he founded it by deed of 12 June 1458, converting the hospital into a college with a president and six fellows, to which college two days later Magdalen Hall surrendered itself and its possessions, its members being incorporated into the New College of St Mary Magdalen.

==Lord Chancellor==
Meanwhile, Waynflete himself had been advanced to the highest office in the state, the Chancellorship, the seals being delivered to him on 11 October 1456 by the King in the priory of Coventry in the presence of the Duke of York, apparently as a person acceptable to both parties. On 27 October 1457 he took part in the trial and condemnation for heresy of Reginald Pecock, Bishop of Chichester, who had been ordained subdeacon and deacon on the same day and by the same bishop as Waynflete himself. Only Pecock&#x27;s books and not the heretic were burnt. As the heresy consisted chiefly in defending the clergy on grounds of reason instead of authority, the proceeding does not show any great enlightenment on Waynflete&#x27;s part. It must have been at this time that an addition was made by Waynflete to the Eton College statutes, compelling the Fellows to forswear the heresies of John Wycliffe and Pecock.

Waynflete presided as Chancellor at the parliament at Coventry in November 1459 (the Parliament of Devils), which
attainted the Yorkist leaders after their defeat at Ludlow. Because of this, three days before the Yorkist attack at Northampton, he delivered the great seal to King Henry VI in his tent near Diapre Abbey, a nunnery near Northampton, on 7 July 1460.

==Later life==
===Political difficulties===

Whether, as alleged by some, Waynflete fled and hid himself during the period covered by the battle of Wakefield and Edward&#x27;s first parliament in 1461 is very doubtful. A testimonial to his fidelity written by Henry to the Pope on 8 November 1460 was written while Henry was in Yorkist hands. Complaints of wrongful exaction of manorial rights laid before Edward IV himself in August 1461 by the tenants of the episcopal manor of East Meon, Hampshire, were decided in the bishop&#x27;s favour in parliament the following December. This also suggests that he was not regarded as an enemy by the Yorkists, even though he was a personal favourite of Henry&#x27;s. A general charter of confirmation to him and his successors of the property and rights of the bishopric of Winchester on 1 July 1462 points in the same direction.

===Eton College===
It is certain that Waynflete took an active part in the restoration of Eton College. Edward had annexed it to St George&#x27;s, Windsor in 1463, depriving it of a large part of its possessions. In the earliest Audit Rolls after the restoration of the college in 1467 there are many entries of visits of Provost Westbury to the lord of Winchester, which in January 1468–69 were for beginning the work of the church and providing money for them. Why a pardon was granted to Waynflete on 1 February 1469 does not appear. On the restoration of Henry VI on 5 October 1470 Waynflete welcomed him on his release from the Tower of London. This necessitated a new pardon, granted a month after Edward&#x27;s reinstatement on 30 May 1471, and a loan to the king of 2000 marks (£1333 6s 8d). In the years 1471–1472 to 1474 Waynflete was largely engaged in completing the church, now called the chapel, at Eton: his glazier supplied the windows, and he contracted on 15 August 1475 for the rood-loft to be made on one side &quot;like to the rode bite&quot; in Bishop Wykeham&#x27;s college at Winchester, and on the other like that of the college of St Thomas of Acre in London. In 1479 he built the ante-chapel at the west end of the chapel, of Headington stone.

===Magdalen College===
In 1474 Waynflete, being the principal executor of Sir John Fastolf, who died in 1459 leaving a much-contested will, procured the conversion of his bequest for a collegiate church of seven priests and seven almsmen at Caistor, Norfolk, into one for seven fellows and seven poor scholars at Magdalen. In the same year the college took possession of the alien priory of Sele, in what is now Upper Beeding, Sussex, the proceedings for the suppression of which had been going on since 1469. The new, now the old, buildings at Magdalen were begun the same year, the foundation-stone being laid in the middle of the high altar on 5 May 1474. Licences from 1477 to authorized additions to the endowment. On 23 August 1480, the college being completed, the great west window being contracted to be made after the fashion of that at All Souls&#x27; College, a new president, Richard Mayew, fellow of New College, was installed on 23 August 1480, and statutes were promulgated. The statutes were for the most part a replica of those of New College, members of which were, equally with members of Magdalen, declared to be eligible for the presidency. They provided for a head and 70 scholars, but the latter were divided into 40 fellows and 30 scholars called &quot;demies&quot;, because their commons were half those of the fellows.

Magdalen College School was established at the gates of the college to be, like Eton, a grammar school free of tuition fees for all comers, under a master and usher, the first master being John Ankywyll, with a salary of £10 a year, the same as at Winchester and Eton. The renewal of interest in classical literature was shown in the prohibition of the study of sophistry by any scholar under the age of eighteen, unless he had been pronounced proficient in grammaticals. On 22 September 1481 Waynflete received Edward IV in state at the college, where he passed the night, and in July 1483 he received Richard III there in even greater state.

In 1484 Waynflete founded another Magdalen College School in his birth town of Wainfleet All Saints, Lincolnshire as a satellite feeder school for Magdalen College, Oxford. The building is now used as a library, with a museum upstairs.

On 27 April 1486, Waynflete, like Wykeham, made his will at their favourite manor, now Bishop&#x27;s Waltham Palace. He gave the same pecuniary bequests to Winchester and New Colleges as to his own college of Magdalen, but the latter he made residuary devisee of all his lands. Waynflete died on 11 August 1486 at Bishop&#x27;s Waltham in Hampshire. He was buried in the Magdalen Chapel at Winchester Cathedral.

==Commemoration==
The Waynflete Building at Magdalen College, Oxford, a hall of residence, commemorates Bishop Waynflete, and the college endows four professorial fellowships in science in his honour, which are collectively known as the Waynflete Professorships.

There is also a Waynflete School in Portland, Maine, which is named after him.

There is a road named Waynflete Road in his honour in the Barton area of Headington, Oxford, one named Waynflete Place in Winchester, a Waynflete Close in Bishop&#x27;s Waltham, and also Waynflete Street, in Earlsfield, London.

&quot;Waynflete&quot; is a boys&#x27; boarding house at Eton College.

An annual memorial service, known as the Waynflete Obit, is held in Winchester Cathedral on the anniversary of his death. The choir for the occasion is formed from members of the Waynflete Singers, who are named after the bishop.

Waynflete projects are research projects undertaken by sixth formers at Magdalen College School, Oxford. Awards are given for the best projects by the President of Magdalen College, Dinah Rose. Alumni of the school are known as &quot;Old Waynfletes&quot;.

<text>The University of Sunderland is a public research university located in Sunderland in the North East of England. Its predecessor, Sunderland Technical College, was established as a municipal training college in 1901. It gained university status in 1992. It now has campuses in Sunderland, London and Hong Kong, and has about 21,000 students .

==History==

Sunderland has been an important centre for education since 674 AD, when Benedict Biscop built St Peter&#x27;s Church and monastery. St Peter&#x27;s Church was the site of the greatest scriptorium north of the Alps. The oldest existing Latin version of the Bible – the &quot;Codex Amiatinus&quot; – was written at St Peter&#x27;s Church. This area has been developed as the Sir Tom Cowie Campus at St Peter&#x27;s of the University of Sunderland. The university&#x27;s £9m state-of-the-art Media Centre, launched in 2004, is near St Peter&#x27;s Church, Monkwearmouth.

===Sunderland Technical College===

The university&#x27;s modern roots can be traced back to 1901, when Sunderland Technical College was established as a municipal training college. It was the first to offer sandwich courses. It began with four departments: Chemistry, Mechanical &amp; Civil Engineering, Physics &amp; Electrical Engineering and Commerce &amp; Languages. Part-time lecturers taught other subjects, ranging from Latin to navigation. 671 students enrolled in the first year; it was more than three times the number expected.

The college&#x27;s longest-serving principal, the physicist VA Mundella was appointed in 1908 and served until his retirement in 1932.

Pharmacy and naval architecture departments were established in 1921 and 1922 respectively. The Pharmacy Department began as a single bench in the Chemistry Department under the leadership of Hope Winch, but soon grew to become the largest in the country. From 1930, some students in the Faculty of Applied Science read for degrees of the University of Durham. In 1930, a Mining Department was established and pharmacy students could read for the Bachelor of Pharmacy degree of the University of London. Sunderland was also recognised by London University as a centre for its BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) degree in 1934.

During the Second World War, Sunderland ran special courses for the armed forces and the Ministry of Labour.

In the 1960s, a PDP-8 hybrid computer was installed at the Chester Road site. There was also an Elliot Brothers 803B digital computer.

A new complex of buildings, including a new Students&#x27; union and Hall of Residence facilities, on nearby Chester Road was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1964.

Sunderland Polytechnic was established on 26 January 1969, incorporating the Technical College, the School of Art (which was also established in 1901) and the Sunderland Teacher Training College (established in 1908). Sunderland was among the first of 30 Polytechnics, like polytechnics or technological universities in other countries their aim was to teach both purely academic and professional vocational subjects. Their focus was applied education for work and their roots concentrated on engineering and applied science, they also created departments concerned with the humanities.

As a polytechnic, Sunderland created the first part-time, in-service BEd (Bachelor of Education) programme in the country.

===University status===

After the passage of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the polytechnic gained university status.

Lord Puttnam became the university&#x27;s first Chancellor in 1998. The Sunderland Empire Theatre was the regular venue for the graduation ceremonies, although they have been hosted at the Stadium of Light since 2004. In July 2007, he stepped down to become the Chancellor of the Open University.

On 23 May 2008 the university announced that former Olympic athlete Steve Cram had been appointed as Chancellor and would be officially installed at a ceremony on 27 June 2008. Singer and songwriter, Emeli Sandé was officially installed as the University of Sunderland&#x27;s new Chancellor on 10 July 2019 during the university&#x27;s summer Academic Awards.

In 2018, it was announced that Sunderland was to host one of five new medical schools established under a UK government initiative to increase the number of training places for doctors. The medical school opened in September 2019.

On 24 September 2018, Sir David Bell became Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Sunderland.

== Current Operations ==
As Sir David Bell began his new role as Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Sunderland on 24 September 2018, he announced the closure of history, politics, modern languages and public health courses, and of research in those fields, on 13 January 2020.

=== Childcare Centre ===
It was announced in an email from Sir David Bell on 18 September 2024 that St Mary&#x27;s Childcare Centre based at City Campus will close permanently on 23 July 2025. &quot;The Childcare Centre is currently running at a substantial loss. This means that it is subsidised by the University, with the subsidy for 2023/24 projected to be in excess of £250,000.&quot; said Bell. It is of note that Sir David Bell&#x27;s salary is in excess of the subsidised cost of the childcare centre each year, his salary being £301,334 plus £2024.35 in expenses for the year of 2021 and £307,008 plus £6167.61 for the year of 2022. &quot;Last academic year, the service was used by 45 families, including 17 members of staff and 11 students. Currently, there are 34 children registered in the Centre.&quot; said Sir David Bell.

=== National Glass Centre ===
Sir David Bell announced on 12 January 2023 that the National Glass Centre building would be closed (and probably demolished) within 3 years. Bell says that due to the cost of the relocation estimated at £9.4million, it has instead decided to close the course in summer 2026, with recruitment stopping from September [2024]. This is despite a £250million capital development budget for the University and will shutter the centre, which is a heritage and history of glassmaking at Sunderland since the 7th century. As a consequence, the University announced on 22 March 2024 that its glass and ceramics academic programme will close in summer 2026.

=== Restructuring, Voluntary Severances, and Layoffs ===
Under the leadership of David Bell, staff at the University of Sunderland have faced departmental restructuring and combining of faculties and voluntary severance offers with caveats that if not enough voluntary severance offers are taken, targeted layoffs and redundancies will be undertaken. On 30 September 2024, the University and Colleges Union (UCU) warned the institution is considering 76 redundancies, including 60 out of 549, more than one in ten, of its academic staff. The union added: &quot;This is the second formal notification of redundancies in under six months. In neither this, nor the previous notification, were any management jobs put at risk.&quot; It is of note that during this period of layoffs and restructuring, a new executive member of staff was appointed, for the position of Pro Vice Chancellor of Learning and Teaching.

=== Parking Increase Controversy ===
16th May 2024, it was announced that parking at the University of Sunderland will see a rise from £1.30 to £6 per day - or 462% - and from 35p to £1.60 per hour. This has seen considerable calls for the price to return to the previous rate from the student and staff unions. It is of note that while students, staff, and visitors&#x27; rates will increase to these amounts, the executive staff do not face the same rise in parking charges, with the previous rate of £56.10 per month increasing to £144.00 per month, a 156.7% increase compared to the 462% increase for staff, students, and other visitors.

==Campuses==

There are two campuses in Sunderland, one in Hong Kong and one in London. The Sunderland campuses are City Campus and the Sir Tom Cowie Campus at St Peter&#x27;s. 
===Sunderland===
====St Peter&#x27;s====
St Peter&#x27;s opened during the 1990s on the north bank of the River Wear, the site of St Peter&#x27;s Church and monastery built by Benedict Biscop in 674 AD.

In September 2002, the campus was renamed ‘The Sir Tom Cowie Campus at St. Peter&#x27;s’, after the local businessman who was one of the university&#x27;s primary supporters. The Sunderland Business School is similarly named ’The Reg Vardy Centre’, and another building, primarily used by the School of Computing and Technology, is ’The David Goldman Informatics Centre’.

St Peter&#x27;s Campus includes the following: North Shore (formerly Campus and Manor Quay), Wearbank House, Reg Vardy Centre, St Peter&#x27;s Library, David Goldman Informatics Centre, Prospect Building (including Sir Tom Cowie Lecture Theatre), David Puttnam Media Centre, North Sands Business Centre and National Glass Centre (which houses the Glass and Ceramics department and the Institute for International Research in Glass). In January 2023 it was announced that the National Glass Centre building would be closed (and probably demolished) within 3 years. As a consequence, the University announced on 22 March 2024 that its glass and ceramics academic programme will close in summer 2026. The David Puttnam Media Centre houses television and radio production facilities for the School of Arts, Design and Media, student led community radio station (Spark Sunderland), and Made in Tyne &amp; Wear, and opened in 2003. The campus was officially opened in March 2004 by Estelle Morris, former Education Secretary and Pro Vice-Chancellor from 2005 to 2009.

====City====
In 2006, the Chester Road Campus was renamed City Campus, and work started on refurbishment of the Edinburgh Building administrative centre, the creation of the Gateway one-stop-shop for student support, and the redevelopment of Murray Library, and the Design Centre.

<text>In Kantian philosophy, the thing-in-itself () is the status of objects as they are, independent of representation and observation. The concept of the thing-in-itself was introduced by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, and over the following centuries was met with controversy among later philosophers. It is closely related to Kant&#x27;s concept of noumena or the objects of inquiry, as opposed to phenomena, its manifestations.

==Kantian philosophy==

In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, Kant argued the sum of all objects, the empirical world, is a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations. Kant introduces the thing-in-itself as follows:

==Criticism==
===F. H. Jacobi===

The first to criticize the concept of a thing-in-itself was F. H. Jacobi, with the expression:

===G. E. Schulze===

The anonymously published work &quot;Aenesidemus&quot; was one of the most successful attacks against the project of Kant. According to Kant&#x27;s teaching, things-in-themselves cannot cause appearances, since the category of causality can only find application to objects of experience. Kant, therefore, does not have the right to claim the existence of things-in-themselves.

This contradiction was subsequently generally accepted as being the main problem of the thing-in-itself. The attack on the thing-in-itself, and the skeptical work in general, had a big impact on Fichte, and Schopenhauer called G. E. Schulze, who was revealed to be the author, “the acutest&quot; of Kant&#x27;s opponents.

===Johann Gottlieb Fichte===

Initially Fichte embraced Kantian philosophy, including a thing-in-itself, but the work of Schulze made him revise his position.
The system which Fichte subsequently published, &quot;Science of Knowledge&quot;, scraps the thing-in-itself.

===Schopenhauer===

In his &quot;Critique of the Kantian Philosophy&quot; appended to &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; (1818), Arthur Schopenhauer agreed with the critics that the manner in which Kant had introduced the thing-in-itself was inadmissible, but he considered that Kant was right to assert its existence and praised the distinction between thing-in-itself and appearance as Kant&#x27;s greatest merit. As he wrote in volume 1 of his &quot;Parerga and Paralipomena&quot;, &quot;Fragments of the History of Philosophy,&quot; §13:

===Mainländer===

A unique position is taken by Philipp Mainländer, who hailed Kant for breaking the rules of his own philosophy to proclaim the existence of a thing-in-itself.

<doc id="610773" wikidata="Q1852883" url="?curid=610773" title="Per-unit system">
<text>In the power systems analysis field of electrical engineering, a per-unit system is the expression of system quantities as fractions of a defined base unit quantity. Calculations are simplified because quantities expressed as per-unit do not change when they are referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This can be a pronounced advantage in power system analysis where large numbers of transformers may be encountered. Moreover, similar types of apparatus will have the impedances lying within a narrow numerical range when expressed as a per-unit fraction of the equipment rating, even if the unit size varies widely. Conversion of per-unit quantities to volts, ohms, or amperes requires a knowledge of the base that the per-unit quantities were referenced to. The per-unit system is used in power flow, short circuit evaluation, motor starting studies etc.

The main idea of a per unit system is to absorb large differences in absolute values into base relationships. Thus, representations of elements in the system with per unit values become more uniform.

A per-unit system provides units for power, voltage, current, impedance, and admittance. With the exception of impedance and admittance, any two units are independent and can be selected as base values; power and voltage are typically chosen. All quantities are specified as multiples of selected base values. For example, the base power might be the rated power of a transformer, or perhaps an arbitrarily selected power which makes power quantities in the system more convenient. The base voltage might be the nominal voltage of a bus. Different types of quantities are labeled with the same symbol (pu); it should be clear whether the quantity is a voltage, current, or other unit of measurement.

==Purpose==

There are several reasons for using a per-unit system:
* Similar apparatus (generators, transformers, lines) will have similar per-unit impedances and losses expressed on their own rating, regardless of their absolute size. Because of this, per-unit data can be checked rapidly for gross errors. A per unit value out of normal range is worth looking into for potential errors.
* Manufacturers usually specify the impedance of apparatus in per unit values. 
* Use of the constant formula_1 is reduced in three-phase calculations. 
* Per-unit quantities are the same on either side of a transformer, independent of voltage level
* By normalizing quantities to a common base, both hand and automatic calculations are simplified. 
* It improves numerical stability of automatic calculation methods.
* Per unit data representation yields important information about relative magnitudes.
The per-unit system was developed to make manual analysis of power systems easier. Although power-system analysis is now done by computer, results are often expressed as per-unit values on a convenient system-wide base.

== Base quantities ==
Generally base values of power and voltage are chosen. The base power may be the rating of a single piece of apparatus such as a motor or generator. If a system is being studied, the base power is usually chosen as a convenient round number such as 10 MVA or 100 MVA. The base voltage is chosen as the nominal rated voltage of the system. All other base quantities are derived from these two base quantities. Once the base power and the base voltage are chosen, the base current and the base impedance are determined by the natural laws of electrical circuits. The base value should only be a magnitude, while the per-unit value is a phasor. The phase angles of complex power, voltage, current, impedance, etc., are not affected by the conversion to per unit values.

The purpose of using a per-unit system is to simplify conversion between different transformers. Hence, it is appropriate to illustrate the steps for finding per-unit values for voltage and impedance. First, let the base power (&quot;S&quot;) of each end of a transformer become the same. Once every &quot;S&quot; is set on the same base, the base voltage and base impedance for every transformer can easily be obtained. Then, the real numbers of impedances and voltages can be substituted into the per-unit calculation definition to get the answers for the per-unit system. If the per-unit values are known, the real values can be obtained by multiplying by the base values.

By convention, the following two rules are adopted for base quantities:

* The base power value is the same for the entire power system of concern.
* The ratio of the voltage bases on either side of a transformer is selected to be the same as the ratio of the transformer voltage ratings.

With these two rules, a per-unit impedance remains unchanged when referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This allows the ideal transformer to be eliminated from a transformer model.

==Relationship between units==

The relationship between units in a per-unit system depends on whether the system is single-phase or three-phase.

===Single-phase===

Assuming that the independent base values are power and voltage, we have:

: formula_2
: formula_3

Alternatively, the base value for power may be given in terms of reactive or apparent power, in which case we have, respectively,

: formula_4

or

: formula_5

The rest of the units can be derived from power and voltage using the equations formula_6, formula_7, formula_8 and formula_9 (Ohm&#x27;s law), formula_10 being represented by formula_11. We have:

: formula_12
: formula_13
: formula_14

===Three-phase===

Power and voltage are specified in the same way as single-phase systems. However, due to differences in what these terms usually represent in three-phase systems, the relationships for the derived units are different. Specifically, power is given as total (not per-phase) power, and voltage is line-to-line voltage.
In three-phase systems the equations formula_7 and formula_8 also hold. The apparent power formula_17 now equals formula_18

: formula_19
: formula_20
: formula_14

==Example of per-unit==

As an example of how per-unit is used, consider a three-phase power transmission system that deals with powers of the order of 500 MW and uses a nominal voltage of 138 kV for transmission. We arbitrarily select formula_22, and use the nominal voltage 138 kV as the base voltage formula_23. We then have:

: formula_24
: formula_25
: formula_26

If, for example, the actual voltage at one of the buses is measured to be 136 kV, we have:

: formula_27

==Per-unit system formulas==
The following tabulation of per-unit system formulas is adapted from Beeman&#x27;s &quot;Industrial Power Systems Handbook&quot;.
== In transformers ==
It can be shown that voltages, currents, and impedances in a per-unit system will have the same values whether they are referred to primary or secondary of a transformer.

For instance, for voltage, we can prove that the per unit voltages of two sides of the transformer, side 1 and side 2, are the same. Here, the per-unit voltages of the two sides are &quot;E&quot;1pu and &quot;E&quot;2pu respectively.

:formula_28
(source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

&quot;E&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot;2 are the voltages of sides 1 and 2 in volts. &quot;N&quot;1 is the number of turns the coil on side 1 has. &quot;N&quot;2 is the number of turns the coil on side 2 has. &quot;V&quot;base1 and &quot;V&quot;base2 are the base voltages on sides 1 and 2.
: formula_29

For current, we can prove that the per-unit currents of the two sides are the same below.
:formula_30
(source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

where &quot;I&quot;1,pu and &quot;I&quot;2,pu are the per-unit currents of sides 1 and 2 respectively. In this, the base currents &quot;I&quot;base1 and &quot;I&quot;base2 are related in the opposite way that &quot;V&quot;base1 and Vbase2 are related, in that

:formula_31

The reason for this relation is for power conservation
:&quot;S&quot;base1 = &quot;S&quot;base2

The full load copper loss of a transformer in per-unit form is equal to the per-unit value of its resistance:

formula_32

formula_33

Therefore, it may be more useful to express the resistance in per-unit form as it also represents the full-load copper loss.

As stated above, there are two degrees of freedom within the per unit system that allow the engineer to specify any per unit system. The degrees of freedom are the choice of the base voltage (&quot;V&quot;) and the base power (&quot;S&quot;). By convention, a single base power (&quot;S&quot;) is chosen for both sides of the transformer and its value is equal to the rated power of the transformer. By convention, there are actually two different base voltages that are chosen, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;V&quot; which are equal to the rated voltages for either side of the transformer. By choosing the base quantities in this manner, the transformer can be effectively removed from the circuit as described above. For example:

Take a transformer that is rated at 10 kVA and 240/100 V. The secondary side has an impedance equal to 1∠0° Ω. The base impedance on the secondary side is equal to:

formula_34

This means that the per unit impedance on the secondary side is 1∠0° Ω / 1 Ω = 1∠0° pu When this impedance is referred to the other side, the impedance becomes:

formula_35

The base impedance for the primary side is calculated the same way as the secondary:

formula_36

This means that the per unit impedance is 5.76∠0° Ω / 5.76 Ω = 1∠0° pu, which is the same as when calculated from the other side of the transformer, as would be expected.

Another useful tool for analyzing transformers is to have the base change formula that allows the engineer to go from a base impedance with one set of a base voltage and base power to another base impedance for a different set of a base voltage and base power. This becomes especially useful in real life applications where a transformer with a secondary side voltage of 1.2 kV might be connected to the primary side of another transformer whose rated voltage is 1 kV. The formula is as shown below.

formula_37

<text>Meng Po () is the goddess of oblivion in Chinese mythology, who serves Meng Po Soup on the Bridge of oblivion or Naihe Bridge (). This soup wipes the memory of the person so they can reincarnate into the next life without the burdens of the previous life. She awaits the dead souls at the entrance of the 9th round Fengdu ().

==Legends==

According to Chinese mythology, there exist several realms beneath the Earth. Meng Po serves in Diyu, the Chinese realm of the dead, in the 10th court. It is her task to ensure that souls who are ready to be reincarnated do not remember their previous life or their time in hell.

To this end she collects herbs from various earthly ponds and streams to make her Five Flavored Soup of oblivion (). This is given to each soul to drink before they leave Diyu. The brew induces instant and permanent amnesia, and all memory of other lives is lost.

Having been purged of all previous sins and knowledge, the dead spirit is sent to be reborn in a new earthly incarnation according to the karma accrued over their previous lifetimes, and the cycle begins again. In Chinese tradition, there are legends of miracle births, where a newborn is able to speak because the soul of the baby didn&#x27;t drink the Five Flavored Tea of Forgetfulness. Occasionally people are able to avoid drinking the brew, resulting in past life memories surfacing in children.

In some variations of the myth, the true identity of Meng Po is that of Lady Meng Jiang. After the death of her husband, Meng Jiang found herself unable to reincarnate due to her grief. In order to relieve the pain of life of other spirits, Lady Meng took the initiative to create a bowl of soup that would allow spirits to forget the suffering of their material life.

==In popular culture==
* The character increased in popularity in 2018 with the romance film &quot;The Ferry Man Manjusaka&quot;.
* Meng-p&#x27;o Macula, one of the equatorial dark regions on Pluto, is named after Meng Po.
* In the 2022 video game &quot;Dislyte&quot;, the character Jiang Man is blessed with Meng Po&#x27;s abilities.

<doc id="610784" wikidata="Q4118229" url="?curid=610784" title="Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)">
<text>Mark Radcliffe (born 29 June 1958) is an English radio broadcaster, musician and writer. He is best known for his broadcasting work for the BBC, for which he has worked in various roles since the 1980s.

Radcliffe began his broadcasting career in local commercial radio in Manchester before a move to the national station BBC Radio 5, where he met and formed a partnership with Marc Riley, a former guitarist with the Fall. In 1991 he moved to BBC Radio 1, closely followed by Riley with whom, under the moniker Mark and Lard, he worked for 11 years on the station. The pair&#x27;s stint on Radio 1 included a brief and opinion-dividing spell on the flagship &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast&quot; and a subsequent afternoon slot show that garnered three prestigious Sony Radio Academy Awards.

When the Mark and Lard duo left BBC Radio 1 in 2004, Radcliffe joined BBC Radio 2 and has also presented various TV shows for the BBC, including its coverage of the Glastonbury Festival. He remains a presenter on BBC Radio 2, where he presents the weekly programme &quot;The Folk Show&quot;. On BBC Radio 6 Music, he co-hosts the weekend breakfast show with Stuart Maconie; they previously co-presented the weekday afternoon show on the same channel, and before that the evening show on Radio 2.

==Early life==
His father Philip (1932–2018) joined the BBC in Manchester as a news assistant from 2 December 1963, aged 31. By 1967, his father was the producer of Look North in Manchester. His father later worked in the press office of the University of Manchester from 1970 until 1996. His father spoke Russian, and worked with the Great Britain–Russia Society, and later lived in Derbyshire.

Radcliffe was born in Bolton, Lancashire, and educated at Bolton School and the University of Manchester, where he studied English, American Studies and Classical Civilisation. He stayed at the traditional all-male Woolton Hall, Manchester of the university at the Fallowfield Campus, where gowns and suits were worn at meal times, in the late 1970s; there were no exceptions.

He took an interest in music from a young age, playing drums in numerous bands while at school and university and into his working life. 

==Personal life==
He married Bella Sharp on Saturday 19 April 1997 in Cheshire; his 27 year old wife, from Hampshire, was an assistant at Granada TV.

In 1995 he lived in Heaton Mersey.

As of 2007, he lived in Knutsford, Cheshire; with three daughters (one from his first marriage), and became a grandfather in October 2008. In July 2011, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Bolton. On 3 October 2018, he announced on his BBC Radio 2 show that he had &quot;cancerous tongue and lymph node issues&quot; and he would take a break from his radio broadcasting for a while. Radcliffe returned to the show on 13 February 2019.

In 2020, Radcliffe was presented with a Knutsford Civic Award by the Mayor of Knutsford for his work curating events as part of the town&#x27;s music festival. 

==Radio and music==
During his student years, Radcliffe was a member of a number of bands, including a short stint as the drummer for the band Skrewdriver which he left before their later transformation into a white power group. 

His first job was assistant producer at Piccadilly Radio in 1979, producing documentaries, classical music and drama. 

Radcliffe&#x27;s radio presenting career began in late 1982 at Piccadilly Radio, where he hosted a Friday night show called &quot;Cures For Insomnia&quot;. He later hosted &quot;Transmission&quot;, an eclectic show playing local and nationally recognised new wave and post-punk bands as well as European avant-garde and electronic music.

===Radio 5 career===
Radcliffe came to prominence as a DJ on BBC Radio 5&#x27;s &quot;Hit the North&quot; from 28 August 1990, but also appeared on other shows such as &quot;Cult Radio&quot;. Nearly twenty years later, in 2009, he briefly stood in as a presenter on BBC Radio 5 Live, the station that replaced it, to cover Simon Mayo&#x27;s afternoon show.

===BBC Radio 1===
Radcliffe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 career began in 1983 when he produced sessions at Maida Vale Studios for John Peel&#x27;s show, and was the head of live music. He moved back to Piccadilly Radio in 1985 as head of music. He moved back to the BBC, producing arts shows for Radio 2, and Radio 5&#x27;s &#x27;5 A Side&#x27;; as a producer he was the first to put Caroline Aherne on national radio as Mrs Merton.

Radio 1 had heard his programme on the former Radio 5, and offered him two weeks when Mark Goodier was off, and afterwards Radio 1 offered him a weekly one-hour show on Mondays. In 1991, he started presenting the one-hour Monday evening show &quot;Out on Blue Six&quot;. 

In early 1993 he hosted the arts programme &quot;The Guest List&quot; on Thursdays.

Also in 1993, Radcliffe presented &quot;Skyman&quot;, an odd show that he presented in character as a visiting alien, and all the records played were space-related. This half-hour show aired immediately before &quot;Out on Blue Six&quot; on Monday evenings.

His most famous work was when he took over from Nicky Campbell on 28 October 1993. This was part of the act Mark and Lard (with Marc &quot;The Boy Lard&quot; Riley) on Radio 1. The duo began in a 10 pm – midnight slot, the graveyard shift, on Mondays to Thursdays. 

Mark and Lard hosted a show of unprecedented variety, incorporating poetry readings from regular guest Ian McMillan, off the wall, irreverent comedy, bizarre quizzes &#x27;Fish or Fowl&#x27;, &#x27;Bird or Bloke&#x27;, &#x27;Bard or Blake&#x27; (amongst others), and a playlist that rivalled John Peel in eclecticism. The show also held some of the best sessions from up and coming and alternative bands of the time, including Throwing Muses, Moloko, Nick Cave, Pulp, Cardiacs, The Bluetones, Babybird, The Divine Comedy, Placebo and Mice. Radcliffe is also credited with the success of White Town&#x27;s &quot;Your Woman&quot; in January 1997.

Following Chris Evans&#x27; sudden departure from Radio 1 in early 1997, Radcliffe and Riley were moved to a brief and unsuccessful position on the breakfast show. Their style of music and broadcasting was not a success in this slot, which catered for a more mainstream audience, and they were soon moved into the early afternoon slot where they resided for the next seven years. This show was a success and saw them win three Sony Gold awards for Best Daily Music Show.

===BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 6 Music===

Radcliffe left Radio 1 in March 2004 and moved to BBC Radio 2 in June of the same year, with Riley moving to BBC Radio 6 Music. The new show was reminiscent of the graveyard slot he had previously occupied on BBC Radio 1; with live music and studio guests and ran between 10:30 pm and midnight. The respect Radcliffe had garnered as a broadcaster was cemented when he scooped a major interview with Kate Bush in late 2005, her first in several years. For many months prior to this, he had been running his own &#x27;Bush-O-Meter&#x27; on his show, questioning the possible whereabouts and activities of the elusive singer-songwriter and adding a photo of the day&#x27;s guest or the &#x27;Blessed Kate&#x27; to the chart until she appeared on the show. Radcliffe also won a Sony award for this show. 

Starting on 16 April 2007, Radcliffe joined forces with Stuart Maconie to present a new show on BBC Radio 2 on Mondays to Thursdays from 8 pm to 10 pm to much critical acclaim, including winning the prestigious Sony award for best Radio show of 2009. From April 2010, the show was reduced to three nights a week, Mondays to Wednesdays.

For a time, he was a frequent stand-in in partnership with Emma Forbes or Liza Tarbuck during the 2–5 pm slot when Steve Wright was away on holiday, thus taking him back to afternoon radio, and also stood in for Simon Mayo on BBC Radio 5 Live on a few occasions.

In 2009, Radcliffe reunited with Marc Riley to make a series of radio adverts for Manchester City F.C. that were broadcast in North West England.

In spring 2011, his show with Maconie moved to BBC Radio 6 Music, in the weekday afternoon slot. Radcliffe also presented his own weekly solo show on BBC Radio 2, called &quot;Mark Radcliffe&#x27;s Music Club&quot;, and in 2013 he took over the presentation of BBC Radio 2&#x27;s weekly folk programme from Mike Harding. His weekday afternoon show with Maconie was moved on 21 December 2018 to the weekends while he was undergoing treatment for cancer. Maconie had broadcast solo while Radcliffe was away for treatment, but Radcliffe joined Maconie for the last hour of the weekday show. He rang in at home on the first weekend breakfast show on 12 January 2019, and then he rejoined Maconie on a permanent basis from 2 February 2019 and Radcliffe also rejoined to BBC Radio 2 on 13 February 2019.

===Band member===

Radcliffe experienced brief commercial success with Shirehorses, a parody band (its name based on the short-lived band The Seahorses) spawned from his Mark and Lard antics. Earlier in his career, he had played in other bands, including the band Skrewdriver (briefly, before their reincarnation as a white power skinhead band, in which he played no part). Radcliffe has written about his part in this band in his book &quot;Showbusiness&quot;. As of 2007, Radcliffe was a member of the more folk-orientated The Family Mahone which evolved into the group Mark Radcliffe &amp; Foes. He also fronted the Dr. Feelgood tribute band Mark Radcliffe &amp; the Big Figures and the pirate-themed band Galleon Blast. Radcliffe is also co-writer and performer in an avant-garde electronic duo UNE with Paul Langley and performs percussion and backing vocals with the band Fine Lines, who supported Kiefer Sutherland on his 2022 UK tour. Since 2023 Mark has also been performing in a duo with singer/songwriter David Boardman.Their debut album &#x27;First Light&#x27; was released in February 2024.

===&quot;Folk at the Theatre&quot;===

Since 2018, Radcliffe has curated &quot;Folk at the Theatre&quot; as part of the Knutsford Music Festival bringing internationally acclaimed musicians including many of those he has featured on the Folk Show, to the Cheshire town. The events were named for being hosted at the town&#x27;s Little Theatre and later expanded to be hosted in the larger local church as well. 

==Television==
Radcliffe presented a live music TV programme, &quot;The White Room&quot;, for four series on Channel 4 from 11 June 1994 to 23 August 1996, and has regularly appeared in both Channel 4 and the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Glastonbury Festival, as well as the latter&#x27;s broadcasts from the Cambridge Folk Festival. He made a guest appearance as himself in CITV show &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot; in 1997. 

On Thursday 10 July 1997, he presented a 15-week series entitled &#x27;Schools Challenge&#x27; on Granada, for schools in the Manchester area, with a set like &quot;University Challenge&quot;. He was a huge fan of &quot;University Challenge&quot; in the 1970s.

Along with Marc Riley, he presented a music-based quiz programme, &quot;Pop Upstairs Downstairs&quot;, for the BBC/Flextech digital TV channel UK Play in 1999 and 2000. He also presented the BBC One football retrospective show &quot;Match of the Nineties&quot;, which aired in summer 1999. In 2006, he won the ITV singing competition &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; with an appearance portraying The Pogues front-man Shane MacGowan singing &quot;The Irish Rover&quot;. In 2009, he took over from Steve Wright as the presenter of &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;. He presented the BBC Four documentary &quot;The Richest Songs in the World&quot;, which counted down the 10 most successful songs of all time in terms of money earned.

The Shirehorses were due to appear in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; as the folk band Half a Shilling, but had concerns about the potentially racist content of the part they were to play. They were replaced at the last minute by Tim Healy.

In 2014, Radcliffe was the narrator of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Call the Council&quot;.

In 2021, he presented &quot;Live from the Edge&quot;, a 13-part music series shown on Showcase TV (Sky channel 191) from Edge Recording Studio, with performances by bands like The Sherlocks, Sea Fever and The Lottery Winners. Radcliffe was also one of a number of music experts hired by Viacom International Studios UK, to comment on the best selling chart hits of the 1980s and 1990s, for a number of Friday night music countdowns on Channel 5 (with the shows being known under various titles such as &quot;Greatest Hits of the 80s&quot;, or &quot;Britain&#x27;s Biggest 90s Hits&quot;).

==Writing==
Radcliffe wrote the autobiographical &quot;Showbusiness: The Diary of a Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Nobody&quot; (1999); a critically acclaimed history of his attempts at a career as a musician, including his exploits with Shirehorses. His novel &quot;Northern Sky&quot;, based around a folk music club in an imaginary Northern English city, was published in 2005. A book of anecdotes about his life and career, &quot;Thank You For the Days&quot; was published in 2009. Another memoir, &quot;Reelin&#x27; in the Years&quot;, was published in 2011. &quot;Crossroads: In Search of the Moments that Changed Music&quot;, a &quot;personal journey&quot; through music history, was published in September 2019.

==Producing==
Radcliffe started his BBC Radio career in 1983, where he worked as a producer, producing sessions for John Peel featuring artists such as Billy Bragg.
Radcliffe was a producer of &quot;Count Arthur Strong&#x27;s Radio Show!&quot; for BBC Radio 4 from series 1 to series 6.

<text>Reginald Pecock (or Peacock; 1395 – c. 1461) was a Welsh prelate, scholastic, and writer.

==Life==

Pecock was probably born in Laugharne and was educated at Oriel College, Oxford.

Having been ordained priest in 1421, Pecock secured a mastership at Whittington College, London, in 1431 where he was also parish priest of St. Michael Paternoster Royal, the adjacent parish church. On 14 June 1444 he was consecrated as Bishop of St Asaph, and translated as Bishop of Chichester on 23 March 1450. In 1454 he became a member of the privy council.

He wrote books of both a pedagogical and polemical nature. His pedagogical books, in which he proposes a wholly new catechism include &quot;The Donet&quot;, &quot;The Follower to the Donet&quot;, and &quot;The Rule of Christian Religion&quot;. He joined the debate on Christian doctrine in his &quot;Repressing of Over Mich Wyting&quot; [blaming] &quot;the Clergie&quot;, 1449, and &quot;Book of Faith&quot;, 1456. These were both more cogent than the Lollard tenets, and sought to stay the Lollard movement by setting aside ecclesiastical infallibility, and taking the appeal to Scripture and reason alone. It was principally Pecock&#x27;s appeal to reason and his attack on the primacy of episcopal authority for which he was deprived in 1458.

In attacking the Lollards, Pecock put forward the following religious views: he asserted that the Scriptures were not the only standard of right and wrong; he questioned some of the articles of the creed and the infallibility of the Church; he wished &quot;bi cleer witte drawe men into consente of trewe feith otherwise than bi fire and swerd or hangement&quot; and in general he exalted the authority of reason. Owing to these views, the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Bourchier, ordered his writings to be examined. This was done and he was found guilty of heresy.

Pecock was removed from the privy council and he publicly (at St Paul&#x27;s Cross, 4 December 1457), renounced his opinions in accordance with his previously stated opinion about the need for obedience in all matters to the Church hierarchy. Pecock, who has been called &quot;the most prolific English theologian of the 15th century&quot;, was then forced to resign his bishopric in January 1459, and was removed to Thorney Abbey in Cambridgeshire, where he doubtless remained until his death about 1461.
The bishop&#x27;s chief work is the famous &quot;Represser of over-much weeting [blaming] of the Clergie&quot;, which was issued c. 1449–1455. In addition to its great importance in the history of the Lollard movement the &quot;Represser&quot; has an exceptional interest as a model of the English of the time, Pecock being one of the first writers to use the vernacular. In thought and style alike it is the work of a man of learning and ability.

A biography of Pecock is added to the edition of the &quot;Repressor&quot; published by Churchill Babington for the Rolls Series in 1860.

<text>Knowledge level modeling is the process of theorizing over observations about a world and, to some extent, explaining the behavior of an agent as it interacts with its environment.

Crucial to the understanding of knowledge level modeling are Allen Newell&#x27;s notions of the knowledge level, &quot;operators&quot;, and an agent&#x27;s &quot;goal state&quot;.

*The &quot;knowledge level&quot; refers to the knowledge an agent has about its world.
*&quot;Operators&quot; are what can be applied to an agent to affect its state.
*An agent&#x27;s &quot;goal state&quot; is the status reached after the appropriate operators have been applied to transition from a previous, non-goal state.

Essentially, knowledge level modeling involves evaluating an agent&#x27;s knowledge of the world and all possible states and with that information constructing a model that depicts the interrelations and pathways between the various states. With this model, various problem solving methods (i.e. prediction, classification, explanation, tutoring, qualitative reasoning, planning, etc.) can be viewed in a uniform fashion. This modeling aspect is crucial in cognitive architectures for intelligent agents.

In &quot;Applications of Abduction: Knowledge-Level Modeling&quot;, Menzies proposes a new knowledge level modeling approach, called KLB, which specifies that &quot;a knowledge base should be divided into domain-specific facts and domain-independent abstract problem solving inference procedures.&quot; In his method, abductive reasoning is used to find assumptions which, when combined with theories, achieve the desired goals of the system.

Lack of Knowledge-Level in sports coaches might be dangerous and increase risk of injuries.

For a good example of abductive reasoning, look at logical reasoning.

<doc id="610793" wikidata="Q2117346" url="?curid=610793" title="The Amboy Dukes (band)">
<text>The Amboy Dukes were an American rock band formed in 1964 in Chicago, Illinois, and later based in Detroit, Michigan. They are best known for their only hit single, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot;. The band&#x27;s name comes from the title of a novel by Irving Shulman. In the UK, the group&#x27;s records were released under the name of the American Amboy Dukes, because of the existence of a British group with the same name. The band went through a number of personnel changes during its active years, the only constant being lead guitarist and composer Ted Nugent. The band transitioned to being Nugent&#x27;s backing band before he discontinued the name in 1975.

==Origins==
Ted Nugent, the nucleus of the Amboy Dukes, was born and raised in Detroit and started performing in 1958 at age 10. He played in a group called the Royal High Boys from 1960 to 1962 and later in group named the Lourds, where he first met future Amboy Dukes lead vocalist John Drake. Nugent played with the Lourds until his family moved to Illinois, where he founded the Amboy Dukes in the Chicago area in 1964, playing at The Cellar, in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, among other venues. They later relocated back to Nugent&#x27;s hometown of Detroit. The members included the following:

*Ted Nugent (lead guitar)
*Bob Lehnert (vocalist) – who released a single &quot;Better Than Today&quot; with the band Acrobat in 1972
*Gary Hicks (guitar, vocals)
*Dick Treat (bass, vocals)
*Gail Uptadale (drums)

The original lineup did not release any recordings.

==Musical style==

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal Music&quot; says that the Amboy Dukes were a psychedelic rock band that &quot;pioneered a proto-metal and psychedelic combination&quot;. Later in life, the fiercely anti-drug Ted Nugent would claim that the Amboy Dukes did not celebrate drug use as other late-1960s and early 1970s bands did. Nonetheless, &quot;AllMusic&quot; says that Steve Farmer &quot;penned the drug-fixated lyrics, adding a psychedelic sensibility to an otherwise proto-metal sound&quot;. The band&#x27;s music was also categorized as acid rock by &quot;The Guide to United States Popular Culture&quot; and the &quot;Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound&quot;, as well as hard rock in &quot;Rock Obituaries - Knocking On Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; and &quot;The Rock Cover Song: Culture, History, Politics&quot;. They were also cited as a proto-punk band.

Nugent&#x27;s early guitar playing style with his signature Gibson Byrdland positioned high on his chest became an iconic playing style that visually distinguished him from other players. He combined this with his natural virtuosity and frenzied playing style on lead, adding sonic distinction to his unusual visual approach. This gave him an edge as a performing artist. Nugent&#x27;s appreciation for his guitar inspired him to compose the song &quot;Flight of the Byrd&quot;, which was released as a single and as part of their most popular album, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot;.

Vocalist Rusty Day joined the band Detroit, replacing Mitch Ryder as lead vocalist. it disbanded in 1974. He then returned to his previous band, Cactus, in 1976, playing with them until 1979. He turned down offers to front AC/DC and Lynyrd Skynyrd after the deaths of those bands&#x27; respective lead singers. Day was shot dead in 1982.

Bassist Greg Arama died in a motorcycle accident on September 18, 1979.

Steve Farmer later taught in Redford Township, Michigan. He also performed with backing bands at various venues in and around the Detroit area. Farmer died on April 7, 2020, aged 71.

Rick Lober is a classically trained composer best known in the greater Detroit metro area for his frenetic style of keyboard playing.

The original Amboy Dukes (featuring Nugent, Drake, Farmer, Lober, Solomon and White) performed on April 17, 2009, at the Detroit Music Awards at The Fillmore Detroit. Their performance began with the song &quot;Baby Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, from their 1967 debut single. This was followed by &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot;, and ending with Mitch Ryder&#x27;s &quot;Jenny Take A Ride&quot; (featuring original Ryder drummer Johnny &quot;Bee&quot; Badanjek). In recognition of the band&#x27;s contribution to rock music history, they received a Distinguished Achievement award. As the band left the stage, Nugent thanked all his fellow band members and told the crowd &quot;And everyone knows that The Amboy Dukes are the ultimate garage band on planet earth&quot;.

 Buchanan Street was first feued in 1777 and named after a wealthy Tobacco Lord, plantation owner and former Lord Provost of Glasgow, Andrew Buchanan of Buchanan, Hastie, &amp; Co. He was proprietor of the ground on which it was formed from Argyle Street up to today&#x27;s Gordon Street. Andrew had died in 1759 and his tobacco empire was inherited by his son James Buchanan of Drumpellier (also twice Lord Provost of Glasgow). The family made huge losses following the American Revolution of 1776, losing all their plantations in Virginia. The family members moved into textile manufacturing and industrial expansion. Sale of the land was probably at least in part to offset these initial losses. Palladian villas, similar to those of the 18th century in Argyle Street, Miller Street and Queen Street were erected along with other terraced townhouses from the 1790s onwards, similar to the new George Square and new Royal Exchange Square. Shops, hotels, banks, offices and clubs soon followed including the Western Club and the Athenaeum, later known as the Royal Scottish Academy of Music &amp; Drama, linking through from St George&#x27;s Place. West of Buchanan Street the classical New Town of Blythswood was started around 1800, developed by William Harley and rising up Blythswood Hill to Blythswood Square.

The land around the north and northeast of Buchanan Street, heading towards Port Dundas on the canal, became home to Buchanan Street railway station serving northern Scotland, the first railway terminal in the city-centre. Originally owned by the Caledonian Railway, then the London Midland and Scottish Railway and finally British Railways, it closed in 1966 and the area now contains Glasgow Caledonian University. 
Glasgow Queen Street station, serving the east and north of Scotland, and west to Helensburgh, Oban and Fort William, is immediately east of Buchanan Street at the corner of George Square, and the Buchanan Street station on the Glasgow Subway (which also serves Queen Street Station) is underneath the top half of Buchanan Street. The St. Enoch station of the subway is at the foot of Buchanan Street in St Enoch Square.

A Glasgow branch of the NAAFI was constructed at the intersection of Sauchiehall Street in 1953, but was not a financial success and closed just seven years later – the building becoming a casino for the Stakis organization which it remained until the 1980s. Buchanan Bus Station was opened nearby the top of the street in 1977, at the same time as the street itself was pedestrianised between Bath Street and Argyle Street. The northern section of the street underwent significant regeneration in the late 1980s when the demolition of the former NAAFI building at the intersection took place in 1988 to allow for the construction of the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, opening in 1990, and the adjoining Buchanan Galleries shopping mall, which began construction in 1995 and opened in 1999. Both these new buildings spelled the final end for Parliamentary Road – the main easterly thoroughfare into neighbouring Townhead. Also in 1999, the entire street was repaved with high quality granite stonework and blue neon lighting. The combination of impressive Victorian architecture and modern urban design won Buchanan Street the Academy of Urbanism &quot;Great Street Award&quot; 2008, beating both O&#x27;Connell Street in Dublin and Regent Street/Portland Place, London. The area between Argyle Street and St. Vincent Street is particularly popular with buskers.

In May 2002, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair unveiled a statue of the late-First Minister of Scotland Donald Dewar at the northern end of the street, the only statue in the street. On the west side across from Buchanan Galleries a further major development of shops and housing opened in 2013 stretching through to West Nile Street at Bath Street.

==Location==

At the start of the street where it meets Argyle Street and St Enoch Square the historic Argyll Arcade which opened in 1827 with sixty-three shops and is now the oldest Victorian shopping centre in Britain, and its near neighbour award-winning Princes Square indoor mall face across to the stores which make up the iconic House of Fraser – which started in Glasgow and also owned Harrods of London. Buchanan Street is now entirely pedestrianised, but the streets that cross it (St. Vincent Street, George Street and Bath Street) are not.

In the middle, Royal Exchange Square opens out through to Queen Street. Buchanan Street is met by Nelson Mandela Place, which was renamed by the Labour city council from St George&#x27;s Place, the address of the South African Consulate, as a protest to the African National Congress (ANC) activist Nelson Mandela being a political prisoner of the South African apartheid government at the time. On his release, Glasgow was the first city in the United Kingdom to honour him with the Freedom of the City, October 1993.

Buchanan Street is joined here by St George&#x27;s-Tron Church and the Glasgow Stock Exchange building, and Royal Exchange Square, which now houses the Gallery of Modern Art.

At its north end, meeting Sauchiehall Street, are the Buchanan Galleries and the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, which includes the home of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. 



==Retail==
Buchanan Street is renowned for its variety in high street shopping, including flagship stores, with rents on the street being as much as , making it the sixth most expensive street in the United Kingdom for retail rent, only surpassed by five streets in London. Buchanan Street is also the second busiest shopping thoroughfare, second only to Oxford Street in London. Glasgow has been recognised for being the second best shopping destination in the United Kingdom, after London, since 2008. In 2022, plans were announced to demolish the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre, built in 1999, and create new streets and a mixed use development comprising residential, retail and business properties.

<doc id="610813" wikidata="Q445686" url="?curid=610813" title="Tarnish">
<text>Tarnish is a thin layer of corrosion that forms over copper, brass, aluminum, magnesium, neodymium and other similar metals as their outermost layer undergoes a chemical reaction. Tarnish does not always result from the sole effects of oxygen in the air. For example, silver needs hydrogen sulfide to tarnish, although it may tarnish with oxygen over time. It often appears as a dull, gray or black film or coating over metal. Tarnish is a surface phenomenon that is self-limiting, unlike rust. Only the top few layers of the metal react. The layer of tarnish seals and protects the underlying layers from reacting.

Tarnish preserves the underlying metal in outdoor use, and in this form is called chemical patina. Unlike wear patina necessary in applications such as copper roofing, outdoor copper, bronze, and brass statues and fittings, chemical patina is considered a lot more uneven and undesirable. Patina is the name given to tarnish on copper-based metals, while toning is a term for the type of tarnish which forms on coins.
==Chemistry==
Tarnish is a product of a chemical reaction between a metal and a nonmetal compound, especially oxygen and sulfur dioxide. It is usually a metal oxide, the product of oxidation; sometimes it is a metal sulfide. The metal oxide sometimes reacts with water to make the hydroxide, or with carbon dioxide to make the carbonate. It is a chemical change. There are various methods to prevent metals from tarnishing.

==Prevention and removal==
Using a thin coat of polish can prevent tarnish from forming over these metals. Tarnish can be removed by using steel wool, sandpaper, emery paper, baking soda or a file to rub or polish the metal&#x27;s dull surface. Fine objects (such as silverware) may have the tarnish electrochemically reversed (non-destructively) by resting the objects on a piece of aluminium foil in a pot of boiling water with a small amount of salt or baking soda, or it may be removed with a special polishing compound and a soft cloth. Gentler abrasives, such as calcium carbonate, are often used by museums to clean tarnished silver as they cannot damage or scratch the silver and will not leave unwanted residues.

<doc id="610819" wikidata="Q156021" url="?curid=610819" title="Kristin Otto">
<text>Kristin Otto (; born 7 February 1966) is a former German swimmer, becoming Olympic, World and European champion, multiple times. She is most famous for being the first woman to win six gold medals at a single Olympic Games, doing so at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. In long course, she held the world records in the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle events. Otto was also the first woman to swim the short course 100 meter backstroke in under a minute, doing so at an international short course meet at Indiana University in 1983.

==Career==
Otto was born in Leipzig, Bezirk Leipzig (present-day Sachsen), East Germany, and began swimming at the age of 11, training in an East German sports academy. At sixteen, she participated in her first world championships, the 1982 World Aquatics Championships, winning the gold medal in the 100 meter backstroke as well as two additional gold medals in the 4×100 m relays with the East German team.

After 1982, Otto changed coaches and began concentrating on other speed strokes. At the following European Championships in 1983, Otto finished second in the 100 meter freestyle, following her fellow East German, Birgit Meineke.

In 1984, Otto set a world record in the 200 meter freestyle. She was expected to win gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, but was unable to compete due to the boycott by 14 Eastern Bloc countries, including East Germany. In 1985 she fractured a vertebra, keeping her from competing for most of the year or to go to the European Championships.

Otto returned to competitive swimming at the 1986 World Championships in Madrid, where she won 4 gold medals (100 m freestyle, 200 m individual medley, 4×100 m medley relay and 4×100 m freestyle relay) and 2 silver medals (50 m freestyle, 100 m butterfly). Her success continued the following year at the 1987 European Championships where she won 5 gold medals.

At the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games she once again was expected to win Olympic gold. She won six gold medals, as well as setting Olympic records in the 50 m freestyle and 100 m butterfly.

Otto retired from swimming in 1989. She currently works as a sports reporter for German television.

She was named the Female World Swimmer of the Year in 1984, 1986 and 1988 by &quot;Swimming World&quot;. In October 1986, she was awarded a Star of People&#x27;s Friendship in gold (second class) for her sporting success.

Otto&#x27;s career was marred by the revelations of widespread performance-enhancing drugs used by East German athletes: former teammate Petra Schneider openly admitted that she had used banned substances. However, Otto stated that she was not aware that she was being doped and she passed all the doping tests during competition, saying: &quot;The medals are the only reminder of how hard I worked. It was not all drugs.&quot;

<doc id="610820" wikidata="Q1643279" url="?curid=610820" title="Edict on Maximum Prices">
<text>The Edict on Maximum Prices (Latin: &quot;Edictum de Pretiis Rerum Venalium&quot;, &quot;Edict Concerning the Sale Price of Goods&quot;; also known as the Edict on Prices or the Edict of Diocletian) was issued in 301 AD by Diocletian. The document denounces greed and sets maximum prices and wages for all important articles and services. 

The Edict exists only in fragments found mainly in the eastern part of the empire, where Diocletian ruled. The reconstructed fragments have been sufficient to estimate many prices for goods and services for historical economists (although the Edict attempts to set maximum prices, not fixed ones). It was probably issued from Antioch or Alexandria and was set up in inscriptions in Greek and Latin.

The Edict on Maximum Prices is still the longest surviving piece of legislation from the period of the Tetrarchy. The Edict was criticized by Lactantius, a rhetorician from Nicomedia, who blamed the emperors for the inflation and told of fighting and bloodshed that erupted from price tampering. By the end of Diocletian&#x27;s reign in 305, the Edict was for all practical purposes ignored. The Roman economy as a whole was not substantively stabilized until Constantine&#x27;s coinage reforms in the 310s.

== History ==
During the Crisis of the Third Century, Roman coinage had been greatly debased by the numerous emperors and usurpers who minted their own coins, using base metals to reduce the underlying metallic value of coins used to pay soldiers and public officials.

Earlier in his reign, as well as in 301 around the same time as the Edict on Prices, Diocletian issued Currency Decrees, which attempted to reform the system of taxation and to stabilize the coinage.

It is difficult to know exactly how the coinage was changed, as the values and even the names of coins are often unknown or have been lost in the historical record. [*Following a time of constant wars for power the reigning authorities looking for campaign resources made a series of changes; Diocletian set the value of coins for saving expenses altering the amount of silver contained in them from 50% and a weight of 5 grams per coin to 1% silver and 3 grams weight producing a huge rise in prices.*] Although the decree was nominally successful for a short time after it was imposed, market forces led to more and more of the decree being disregarded and reinterpreted over time.

In the edict of Diocletian, it was mentioned that the wine from Picenum was the most expensive wine, together with Falerno. Vinum Hadrianum was produced in Picenum, in the city of &quot;Hatria&quot; or &quot;Hadria&quot;, the old city of Atri.

== Rediscovery ==
No complete copy of the decree has been found. The text has been reconstructed from fragments of Greek and Latin copies at a number of different sites, most of them in the eastern provinces of Roman empire: Phrygia and Caria in Asia Minor, mainland Greece, Crete, and Cyrenaica. The version of the decree inscribed on the wall of the bouleuterion at Stratonikeia in Caria was the first to be discovered and copied, by William Sherard, the English consul at Smyrna, in 1709. The first attempt at a composite text was made in 1826 by William Martin Leake, working from Sherard&#x27;s copy of the Stratonikeia inscription and a fragment purchased in Alexandria and subsequently brought to Aix-en-Provence. A comprehensive edition of all fragments known by the end of the 19th century was edited by Theodor Mommsen with commentary by Hugo Blümner; this edition formed the basis for a new text and English translation published in 1940 by Elsa Graser, who also incorporated fragments found after the publication of Mommsen&#x27;s edition. Two further critical editions were published in the early 1970s, and new fragments have continued to be discovered.

== Contents ==
Although incomplete, enough of the text is preserved to make the general structure and contents of the edict clear.

All coins in the Decrees and the Edict were valued according to the &quot;denarius&quot;. Many modern writers refer to the coinage used by Diocletian as the &quot;denarius communis&quot;, but this phrase is a modern invention and is not found in any ancient text. The &quot;argenteus&quot; seems to have been set at 100 &quot;denarii&quot;, the silver-washed &quot;nummus&quot; at 25 &quot;denarii&quot;, and the bronze radiate at 4 denarii. The gold &quot;aureus&quot; was revalued at at least 1,200 &quot;denarii&quot;.

The first two-thirds of the Edict doubled the value of the copper and billon coins, and set the death penalty for profiteers and speculators, who were blamed for the inflation and who were compared to the barbarian tribes attacking the empire. Merchants were forbidden to take their goods elsewhere and charge a higher price, and transport costs could not be used as an excuse to raise prices.

The last third of the Edict, divided into 32 sections, imposed a price ceiling – a list of &quot;maxima&quot; – for well over a thousand products. These products included various food items (beef, grain, wine, beer, sausages, etc.), clothing (shoes, cloaks, etc.), freight charges for sea travel, and weekly wages. The highest limit was on one pound of purple-dyed silk, which was set at 150,000 &quot;denarii&quot; (the price of a lion was set at the same price).

== Coinage ==
Each cell represents the ratio of the coin in the column to the coin in the row: thus 1000 denarii were worth 1 solidus.
== Consequences ==
Despite breaking the economic cycle that was driving towards the total collapse of imperial monetary and fiscal policy, the Edict also caused, among other things, higher unemployment and a contraction in production, as well as an increase in bartering, which, compared to monetary transactions, is inherently inefficient and economically problematic.

<doc id="610829" wikidata="Q3094313" url="?curid=610829" title="Gage Park, Chicago">
<text>Gage Park is one of Chicago&#x27;s 77 well-defined community areas, located on the city&#x27;s southwest side; it is also the name of a park within the neighborhood. Gage Park&#x27;s population is largely working-class, and its housing stock is mostly bungalows. For generations, the neighborhood was Eastern European and Irish Catholic. The neighborhood remains overwhelmingly Catholic with the addition of many Hispanic residents. Gage Park is bounded by 49th Street to the north, 59th Street to the south, Central Park Ave to the west, and Leavitt Street to the east.

==History==
The development of Gage Park began in 1873 when South Park Commissioner George W. Gage began working on a planned park at the intersection of Western Ave. and Garfield Boulevard. Upon Gage&#x27;s death in 1875, the park was renamed Gage Park in his honor.

The area developed after Gage&#x27;s passing, slowly adding more and more land and offering up more services to the local community. By 1919, Gage Park had added more land and the park now included ball fields, tennis courts, separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gymnasiums, gardens, and a wading pool. A large field house and auditorium was later added in 1928, with a large mural by Tom Lea added in 1931.

On February 4, 2016, the bodies of six people were discovered in a home on the 5700 block of South California Avenue.

==Education==

Chicago Public Schools operates district public schools.
*K-8 schools serving sections of Gage Park include Morrill, Carson, Talman, Nightingale, Christopher, Fulton, Henderson, Sawyer, Tonti, Sandoval, and Hernandez.
*Gage Park High School serves most of the community area. Some sections are served by Hubbard, Kelly, Curie, and Solorio high schools. Gage Park High School is located on South Rockwell Street, where 728 students attended during the 2013–2014 school year. Of the 728, 96.6% were from low-income households and 18.3% are homeless. The average ACT score in 2014 was 15.2 with the state average being 20.

The United Neighborhood Organization operates the charter schools Rufino Tamayo School and Jovita Idar School.

==Politics==
The Gage Park community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, the Gage Park cast 6,966 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 494 votes for Donald Trump (90.44% to 6.41%). In the 2012 presidential election, Gage Park cast 5,725 votes for Barack Obama and cast 554 votes for Mitt Romney (90.27% to 8.74%).

==Religion==
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago operates Catholic churches. On July 1, 2020, St. Gall Parish will incorporate St. Simon the Apostle Parish into its structure, and St. Gall will be the main church of the merged entity. On the same day St. Rita of Cascia Parish will incorporate St. Clare of Montefalco, and the former will be the main church of the combined entity.

==Notable people==
* Victor Adeyanju, defensive end in the National Football League. Adeyanju, who lived in Gage Park from age seven until graduating from high school, played for the St. Louis Rams from 2006 to 2010.
* Bill Redmond, Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from New Mexico&#x27;s 3rd congressional district from May 13, 1997 – January 3, 1999. He was raised in Gage Park and attended Gage Park High School.
* James Adeyanju, defensive end in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Adeyanju, who lived in Gage Park from birth until graduating from high school, played for the University of Wisconsin–Madison Badgers from 2011 to 2014. He now lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<doc id="610832" wikidata="Q2675608" url="?curid=610832" title="Hard Core Logo">
<text>Hard Core Logo is a 1996 Canadian music mockumentary film directed by Bruce McDonald, adapted by Noel S. Baker from the novel of the same name by Michael Turner. The film illustrates the self-destruction of punk rock, documenting a once-popular band, the titular Hard Core Logo, comprising lead singer Joe Dick (Hugh Dillon), fame-tempted guitarist Billy Tallent (Callum Keith Rennie), schizophrenic bass player John Oxenberger (John Pyper-Ferguson), and drummer Pipefitter (Bernie Coulson). Julian Richings plays Bucky Haight, Dick&#x27;s idol. Several notable punk musicians, including Art Bergmann, Joey Shithead and Joey Ramone, play themselves in cameos. Canadian television personality Terry David Mulligan also has a cameo, playing a fictionalized version of himself.

The film premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. It received widespread critical acclaim, and was nominated for six Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture and Best Director. In a 2001 poll of 200 industry voters, performed by &quot;Playback&quot;, &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; was named the fourth best Canadian film of the last 15 years. In 2002, readers of &quot;Playback&quot; voted it the 4th greatest Canadian film ever made.

A sequel, &quot;Hard Core Logo 2&quot;, was released in 2010.

==Plot==
The film is about a documentary team that follows the reunion of Hard Core Logo, a once-popular punk rock band. Frontman Joe Dick gets the band back together, ostensibly for an anti-gun benefit after hearing Canadian punk legend and personal mentor Bucky Haight, has been shot. They begin the tour in Vancouver and travel thousands of kilometers east along the Trans-Canada Highway to Winnipeg, then northwest along the Yellowhead Highway to Edmonton. 

On the way, the band&#x27;s dark secrets are revealed; however, while they travel, they keep ignoring each other&#x27;s darkness. Bassist John Oxenberger loses his schizophrenia medication and slowly loses his sanity. Guitarist Billy Tallent finds out that by going on tour he loses his position in mainstream American rock band Jenifur and with that his one shot at stardom. 

The band stops by Bucky Haight&#x27;s reclusive estate only to find he was never shot and that Joe fabricated the lie in order to get the band together. The band and documentary crew drop acid and experience hallucinations. Bucky admonishes Joe for using him to get the band together. 

At Edmonton, Tallent finds out he has another opportunity to permanently join Jenifur. Joe finds out from the film crew and later attacks Billy on stage. Dick destroys Tallent&#x27;s Fender Stratocaster, which was a gift from Haight, and the band parts ways. 

In the final scene Joe Dick drinks with the documentary crew members, then suddenly shoots himself in the head.

==Cast==
==Production==
McDonald grew up in the Vancouver punk rock scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was drawn to Michael Turner&#x27;s book about aging musicians. McDonald commented in an interview, &quot;what I thought was really interesting is where it is 15 years later, and what are these guys doing now&quot;. He had just come off the critically acclaimed &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; and friends warned him not to repeat himself by making another road movie. However, McDonald did not see &quot;Logo&quot; as a repeat of previous films: &quot;On the other films, they (the anti-heroes of &quot;Roadkill&quot; and &quot;Highway 61&quot;) go down the road and meet a nutty person and things happened. Here you&#x27;re with the same people throughout – and they are the nutty people!&quot;

McDonald had to persuade Dillon to do the film: &quot;He was going &#x27;Wow, what if the movie is shit, then I&#x27;d lose all my fans from the band, I&#x27;d lose all my credibility!&#x27;&quot; The director auditioned 200 actors for the role but kept coming back to the musician. Dillon remembers, &quot;as soon as he gave me freedom to make the screenplay more believable, I became interested. Bruce allowed me creative input and that&#x27;s what made it a special piece for me&quot;. Dillon drew a lot on his own real life experiences of being in a band.

The music of the fictional band was all written by Michael Turner, arranged and produced by Peter J. Moore, and performed by Hugh Dillon and the band Swamp Baby.

== Soundtrack ==
Although music figures heavily in the film, a conventional soundtrack album was not initially released; instead, McDonald had several notable Canadian bands record covers of the songs in the film, and packaged them as if they were a tribute album to a real band. That album, &quot;A Tribute to Hard Core Logo&quot;, was also released in 1996.

A more traditional soundtrack album, comprising the actual music contained in the film itself, was released later in 1998 on Velvel Records.

==Reception==
&quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; screened at the Cannes Film Festival. McDonald remembers, &quot;Cannes was very humbling. You&#x27;re in the same arena as Bernardo Bertolucci and Czechoslovakian pornographers. It&#x27;s such a bizarre spectrum&quot;. The film went on to be nominated for six Genie Awards, including Best Picture and Director. Quentin Tarantino saw &quot;Logo&quot; at a film festival and liked it so much that he bought the U.S. distribution rights under his Rolling Thunder label and even toyed with casting Dillon in &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; was well received by Canadian film critics. In his review for the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, Bruce Kirkland praised the cast: &quot;They&#x27;re all so convincing it is impossible to believe they&#x27;re not all the real thing&quot;. John Griffin, in his review for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, called it &quot;a masterful exercise in edgy virtuoso film craft, subversive propaganda and exhilarating entertainment&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Peter Goddard praised Noel Baker&#x27;s screenplay for providing &quot;some of the funniest and deftest writing Canadian moviemaking has heard in years but it can&#x27;t hide the bitter-sweetness just below the surface&quot;. Liam Lacey in his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote: &quot;Though the jumpy, parodic, disruptive style suits rock music, the same techniques prevent viewers from investing deeply in the characters and the story. The ride is fun, but it doesn&#x27;t quite reach a destination&quot;.

The film received general favorable review from American film critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a &quot;B−&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote: &quot;Most of the characters are too goofy to register. Still, there are times when Dillon&#x27;s performance lays bare why, for sheer style, burning out will always have the edge over fading away&quot;. In his review for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Peter Stack wrote: &quot;Director Bruce McDonald (&quot;Dance Me Outside&quot;) has turned out a tight, fascinating on-the-road rock movie, a delicious study in mean-spiritedness as well as the gut imperatives that make punk music the unsettling, hostile experience it is&quot;. Stephen Holden, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that &quot;unlike &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;, which cast a comically jaundiced eye on every nuance of the heavy-metal life style, this clever mock documentary ... blends satire and sentiment in a way that keeps you emotionally off balance&quot;.

=== Awards and nominations ===
The film won the Genie Award for Best Original Song for the track &quot;Who the Hell Do You Think You Are?&quot;, and was nominated for five other awards including Best Picture and Best Director. 

It took the Best Canadian Feature at the Sudbury Cinéfest. At the Vancouver International Film Festival, it received the $10,000 CITY-TV award for Best Canadian Film and Noel Baker won the Rogers Prize for Best Canadian Screenplay.

== Legacy ==
In a 2001 poll of 200 industry voters, performed by &quot;Playback&quot;, &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; was named the second best Canadian film of the last 15 years. In 2002, readers of &quot;Playback&quot; voted it the 4th greatest Canadian film ever made.

The character Billy Tallent, portrayed by Callum Keith Rennie, was the inspiration for the name of the Canadian band Billy Talent.

McDonald asked Daniel MacIvor to write a &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;-style screenplay that would be a sequel to &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot;, with Hugh Dillon and Callum Keith Rennie playing the roles, but scheduling (among other reasons) kept it from moving forward. After some discussion, McDonald and MacIvor decided to rewrite the screenplay for two women, with Molly Parker and Tracy Wright in mind. The film was released in 2010 as &quot;Trigger&quot;. Rennie has a cameo in the film, reprising his role as Billy Tallent.

== Sequel ==
A sequel film, &quot;Hard Core Logo 2&quot;, was released in 2010. Bruce McDonald returned to direct and write the screenplay. The film centers on the real-life band Die Mannequin. McDonald and Julian Richings are the only returning cast members from the first film. 

The sequel premiered at the Whistler Film Festival on December 4, 2010 with the members of Die Mannequin and McDonald walking the red carpet. It had its second screening at the Victoria Film Festival on February 6, 2011. It received mixed reviews.

<doc id="610834" wikidata="Q7431920" url="?curid=610834" title="Schnucks">
<text>Schnuck Markets, Inc., doing business as Schnucks (), is a supermarket chain. Based in the St. Louis area, the company was founded in 1939 with the opening of a store in north St. Louis and currently operates over 100 stores in four states throughout the Midwest (Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin). Schnucks also ran stores under the Logli Supermarkets and [[Hilander Foods]] banners. Schnucks is one of the largest privately held supermarket chains in the United States and dominates the St. Louis metro grocery market.

==History==

Schnuck Markets, Inc. was founded in St. Louis in 1939. In 1943, its first large-scale retail store was opened, measuring . By 1952, its first major store was opened in Brentwood, a St. Louis suburb. The Schnucks symbol, a soldier, was introduced in 1968 (during the Vietnam War). Schnucks continued to grow, adopting the motto &quot;Friendliest Stores In Town&quot; and acquiring stores in Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, Iowa, and Wisconsin. By the late 1960s, Schnucks had 10 stores in the St. Louis area.

In a merger in 1970, Schnucks acquired the Bettendorf-Rapp chain of grocery stores—temporarily forming the Schnucks-Bettendorf&#x27;s chain until the latter half of the combined name was dropped a couple of years later—just as Bettendorf&#x27;s had swallowed up the Rapp chain of stores to form Bettendorf-Rapp&#x27;s in the 1960s. Schnucks underwent a major expansion in 1995 when it purchased from Loblaws the National Supermarkets chain (a total of 57 stores), also based in St. Louis.

The company&#x27;s growth in the St. Louis area was bolstered by the local abandonment of two major supermarket chains: A&amp;P in the 1970s, and Kroger in 1986.

=== Expansion ===
In 2002, Schnucks agreed to buy 12 Seessel&#x27;s stores in the Memphis, Tennessee area, from Albertsons, Inc. Schnucks operated these stores until September 2011. Kroger subsequently purchased these stores; eight reopened as Kroger, with the others closing altogether. Seven convenience stores operating under the Schnucks name also were sold, to be converted to the Kroger-owned brand &quot;Kwik Shop&quot;.

In 2008, Schnucks acquired grocery store Hart Food and Drug in O&#x27;Fallon, IL making it the fifth Schnucks in St. Clair County.

In August 2009, Schnucks opened a store in downtown St. Louis. This store, located at the corner of Ninth and Olive Streets in the central business district, was called &quot;Culinaria – A Schnucks Market&quot; and was advertised as a &quot;new urban prototype&quot;. The store includes of shopping space, an additional mezzanine with a wine department, tapas/wine bar, a full-service pharmacy, meat and seafood departments, florist, bakery, and a Kaldi&#x27;s Coffee bar. The placement of the store reflects the downtown area&#x27;s urban renewal of the 21st century, including Washington Avenue Loft District, St. Louis loft-style condominiums and apartments. In 2020, Schnucks opened another prototype store, named &quot;EatWell - A Natural Food Store by Schnucks&quot;, located in a former Lucky&#x27;s Market off Providence Road in Columbia, Missouri near the campus of the University of Missouri.

On September 18, 2018, it was announced that SuperValu would sell 19 of its Shop &#x27;n Save locations to Schnucks.

In 2020/2021, Schnucks exited the Iowa/Quad Cities market with the closing of their Bettendorf, Iowa store and a pharmacy in Moline, Illinois (with the customers transferred to the stand-alone CVS as part of that acquisition).

In September 2022, Schnucks purchased the only two locations of Missouri-based grocer Fricks Market. In October 2022, the newly renovated Schnucks store of Union opened to the general public.

==Pharmacy==
The first Schnucks Pharmacy was opened in March 1970. As of 2012, there were 95 in-store pharmacies across Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa. The quality of the healthcare provided by Schnucks Pharmacy was recognized as &quot;Pharmacy Chain of the Year 2008&quot; by &quot;Drug Topics&quot; magazine. In 2008, Schnucks offered over 50 generic prescriptions that could be filled for $4 for a 30-day supply, or $10 for a 90-day supply.

In 2020, 110 pharmacies at Schnucks were taken over by CVS Pharmacy, making them the second in-store pharmacy to be converted to the CVS brand after Target had switched to them a few years prior. Along with the ownership change came the closure of 11 pharmacies, mainly near existing CVS locations, with customers being transferred to those respective stores.

<doc id="610836" wikidata="Q2914941" url="?curid=610836" title="Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow">
<text>Victor Alexander John Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, (24 September 1887 – 5 January 1952) was a British Unionist politician and statesman, agriculturalist, and colonial administrator. He served as Governor-General and Viceroy of India from 1936 to 1943. He also served as vice president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh and Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He was usually referred to as Lord Linlithgow, or simply Linlithgow.

==Early life and family==
Hope was born at Hopetoun House, South Queensferry, Linlithgowshire, Scotland, on 24 September 1887.

He was the eldest son of John Adrian Louis Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun, later 1st Marquess Linlithgow, and Hersey Everleigh-de-Moleyns, Countess of Hopetoun and later Marchioness of Linlithgow, daughter of the fourth Baron Ventry. His godmother was Queen Victoria.

He was educated at Ludgrove School and Eton College and on 29 February 1908 succeeded his father as 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow.

In 1912, aged only 25, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Turner, Alexander Crum Brown, Cargill Gilston Knott and James Haig Ferguson. He served as the society&#x27;s vice president from 1934 to 1937.

==Early career==
Linlithgow served as an officer on the Western Front during the First World War. Transferred from Lothians and Border Horse, he commanded a battalion of the Royal Scots. He was mentioned in dispatches and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, ending the war with the rank of colonel.

He then served in various minor roles in the Conservative governments of the 1920s and &#x27;30s. From 1922 till 1924 he served as the civil lord of the Admiralty, becoming chairman of the Unionist Party Organisation in 1924 for two years. He also served as president of the Navy League from 1924 until 1931. He was chairman of the Medical Research Council and of the governing body of the Imperial College London. Linlithgow was also chairman of the committee on the distribution and prices of agricultural produce and president of the Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture until 1933. In 1926 he was chairman of the Royal Commission on Agriculture in India, which published its findings in 1928. Influenced by submissions to the Royal Commission, &quot;a decade later, when (he) became Viceroy of India he showed a personal interest in nutrition, pushing it to the top of the research agenda&quot;. The reason for sending a Commission on Agriculture under Linlithgow was &#x27;because constitutional reform without economic and educational reform will do nothing to ameliorate the condition of life of the mass of the population of India, and this is what matters most.&#x27;

From April 1933 to November 1934 he was chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Indian constitutional reform, drawn up to consider the proposals for Indian self-government contained in the government&#x27;s March 1933 White Paper. He agreed to take the job after Lord Salisbury declined it (although he agreed to serve on the committee) and Sidney Peel, the second choice, fell ill with phlebitis. Linlithgow told the Joint Select Committee that he would show no favouritism between the Indian factions (Hindus, Muslims and Princely States) and would be neutral just as he was between his own five children. The committee&#x27;s proposals became the Government of India Act 1935.

==Viceroy==

Having previously declined both the governorship of Madras and the governor-generalship of Australia (his father was the first Governor-General of Australia), he became the Viceroy of India, succeeding Lord Willingdon. Travelling out to India on the P&amp;O liner RMS &quot;Strathmore&quot;, he arrived in Bombay, with his wife, daughters, and personal staff, on 17 April 1936. Linlithgow implemented the plans for local self-government embodied in the Government of India Act 1935, which led to provincial governments led by the Congress Party in five of the eleven provinces of British India, but the recalcitrance of the princes prevented the establishment of elected governments in most of the princely states.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, Linlithgow&#x27;s rejection of the request by the Congress for a declaration that India would be given the chance to determine its own future after the war led to the resignation of the Congress ministries. He declared India to be at war with Germany in September 1939, without consulting Indian politicians. On 8 August 1940 Lord Linlithgow made a statement on behalf of the British government. It was known as the August Offer and offered greater rights in the governance of India to the Indian people. The proposal was rejected by most Indian politicians, including the Congress Party and the Muslim League. Disputes between the British administration and Congress ultimately led to massive Indian civil disobedience in the Quit India Movement. Linlithgow suppressed the disturbances and arrested the Congress leaders. Some historians have partly blamed Linlithgow for the Bengal famine of 1943 which resulted in three million deaths.

==Retirement==

His seven-year tenure as viceroy, the longest in the history of the Raj, ended in 1 October 1943, succeeded by Field Marshal Sir Archibald Wavell who had been military commander in British India since January 1942.

Indians were not kind in their assessments of his career. V. P. Menon in &quot;The Transfer of Power in India&quot; stated: &quot;His 7½ year regime – longer than that of any other Viceroy – was conspicuous by its lack of positive achievement. When he left India, famine stalked portions of the countryside. There was economic distress due to the rising cost of living and the shortage of essential commodities. On the political side, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru expressed the general feeling thus: &#x27;Today, I say, after seven years of Lord Linlithgow&#x27;s administration the country is much more divided than it was when he came here&#x27;.&quot;

A sincere Presbyterian, he served as Lord High Commissioner to the Church of Scotland in 1944 and 1945. He died in 1952.

==Honours==
** Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter (KG)
** Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle (KT)

** Knight Grand Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE)
** Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE)
** Recipient of the Territorial Decoration (TD)

==Family==
On 19 April 1911 he married Doreen Maud Milner (1886–1965), the younger daughter of Sir Frederick Milner. They had twin sons and three daughters:
*Charles William Frederick Hope, 3rd Marquess of Linlithgow (7 April 1912 – 1987); succeeded to his father&#x27;s marquessate
*John Adrian Louis Hope, 1st Baron Glendevon (7 April 1912 – 18 January 1996); became a Conservative statesman and married the daughter of the English novelist W. Somerset Maugham
*Lady Anne Adeline (27 January 1914 – 2007)
*Lady Joan Isabella (21 September 1915 – 1989)
*Lady Doreen Hersey Winifred (17 June 1920 – 22 January 1997), the mother of Lucinda Green, a famous equestrian.

In some circles the three girls were known as Faint Hope, Little Hope, and No Hope.

<doc id="610844" wikidata="Q1950584" url="?curid=610844" title="Scarlet kingsnake">
<text>The scarlet kingsnake (Lampropeltis elapsoides) is a species of kingsnake found in the southeastern and eastern portions of the United States. Like all kingsnakes, they are nonvenomous. They are found in pine flatwoods, hydric hammocks, pine savannas, mesic pine-oak forests, prairies, cultivated fields, and a variety of suburban habitats; not unusually, people find scarlet kingsnakes in their swimming pools, especially during the spring. Until recently, and for much of the 20th century, scarlet kingsnakes were considered a subspecies of the milk snake; however, Pyron and Bubrink demonstrated the phylogenetic distinction of this species and its closer relationship to the mountain kingsnakes of the southwestern United States. These largely fossorial snakes are the smallest of all the species within the genus &quot;Lampropeltis&quot;, usually ranging from at maturity. The maximum recorded length is in Jonesboro, AR . Hatchlings range in size from .
==Taxonomy==
The generic name, &quot;Lampropeltis&quot;, is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;lamprós&quot; (λαμπρος) meaning &quot;shiny&quot; and &quot;peltas&quot; (πελτας) meaning &quot;shield&quot;, after the sheen of their scales. Its specific name, &quot;elapsoides&quot;, is a Latinization of the Greek word &quot;éllops&quot; (ελλοπς) which refers to coral and was used to describe the 19th century genus, &quot;Elaps&quot; (the type genus of the family Elapidae), which included the eastern coral snake &quot;(Micrurus fulvius)&quot;, a venomous species which the scarlet kingsnake resembles and with which the scarlet kingsnake is partly sympatric. The range of scarlet kingsnakes extends considerably further north and northeast than the eastern coral snake.

The scarlet kingsnake was once believed to have intergraded with the eastern milk snake, which produced a variation once named as a subspecies called the Coastal Plains milk snake (&quot;L. t. temporalis&quot;), but this is no longer recognized as a legitimate taxon.

==Description==
Scarlet kingsnakes have a tricolored pattern of black, red, white, and various shades of yellow bands that appear to mimic the venomous coral snake in a form of Batesian mimicry. A method to help differentiate between venomous and non-venomous tricolor snakes in North America is found in an enormous variety of popular phrases, which are usually some variation of &quot;Red touches black, friend of jack, red touches yellow, kill a fellow&quot;, &quot;red on yellow, kill a fellow; red on black, venom lack&quot;, or &quot;if red touches yellow, you&#x27;re a dead fellow; if red touches black, you&#x27;re all right, Jack&quot;. For tri-colored snakes found east of the Mississippi River, all of these phrases can be replaced with the simple phrase, &quot;Red face, I&#x27;m safe&quot;, in reference to the red snout of scarlet kingsnakes as opposed to the prominent black snout of the eastern coral snake (&quot;Micrurus fulvius&quot;).

Scarlet kingsnakes are born with white, black, and red banding. As they mature, they develop varying shades of yellow within geographic areas where this is expressed. In addition, the yellowing is not uniform, but rather this pigmentation proceeds from lighter to darker from the lowermost scales upward to the dorsum, or &quot;back&quot;, presenting a multiple yellowish band. Early expression of yellowing appears as early as 3 months and continues through the first 3 years. As adults age, a gradual darkening of the yellowish banding occurs. The yellow pigmentation varies from lemon, to school-bus yellow, to tangerine, to apricot. 

Scarlet kingsnakes are secretive, nocturnal, fossorial snakes, so are infrequently seen by people. They are excellent climbers. They can be found underneath the loose bark on rotting pines (which is a favorite place for them to hide during spring or during heavy rains), under the bark on dying or decaying pines and their stumps, and decaying wood, where they hunt for their favorite prey, small snakes and lizards, especially skinks. 

Hatchling scarlet kingsnakes show a strong predisposition for ground skinks (&quot;Scincella lateralis&quot;), often to the exclusion of other prey items. One study showed that elongate squamates made up about 97% of these snakes diets, potentially due to their small mouths. Out of those elongate squamates, the aforementioned skinks made up 74%, while colubroid snakes made up only 15%. All prey items ingested in this study were consumed headfirst, and on average prey was 19% of predator mass. It has also been noted that the diet of &quot;Lampropeltis elapsoides&quot; is unusually narrow compared to adults of most other species.

==Reproduction==
The scarlet kingsnake is polygynandrous, meaning both males and females will mate with multiple partners. Their breeding season is March–June, and females have multiple egg clutches that incubate for 40–65 days.

&quot;Lampropeltis elapsoides&quot; is an oviparous species of snake that lays eggs in clutches of 4-12, usually under rotting wood and between rocks and logs. These eggs are white and slender, with most adhering to one another. Eggs typically hatch within 2-2.5 months, though times may vary.

==In other media==
===Film===
Scarlet kingsnakes were used to simulate coral snakes in the 2006 film &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot;. A scarlet kingsnake also appears briefly as an unidentified venomous snake in an early scene of 2001 film &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;.

===Television===
In Season 5 of &quot;Peep Show&quot; Super Hans rents a scarlet kingsnake as a prop for a house party. Despite Hans&#x27; mnemonic stating &quot;Red next to black, jump the fuck back, red next to yellow, cuddly fellow&quot;, kingsnakes are not venomous.
