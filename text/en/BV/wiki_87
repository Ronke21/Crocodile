<doc id="629985" wikidata="Q3347840" url="?curid=629985" title="Oak Ridges—Markham (federal electoral district)">
<text>Oak Ridges—Markham was a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 to 2015. Its population in 2006 was 169,645., with 136,755 electors, the highest of any riding in Canada. By 2011, the riding&#x27;s population had risen to 228,997, the largest population of all ridings in Canada.

The district covered part of the suburbs north of Toronto. It included the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville, most of the township of King (excepting extreme northeast) the northern portions of the town of Richmond Hill (including all of Oak Ridges), and the northern and eastern portions of the city of Markham.

The electoral district was created in 2004 52.5% from Oak Ridges, 30% from Markham, 13% from Vaughan—King—Aurora, and 4.5% from York North riding.

Following the 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution, the district was split between King—Vaughan, Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill, Markham—Unionville, and Markham—Stouffville.

==Demographics==
Communities in Oak Ridges—Markham are the destination for many immigrants to Canada, composing about 41.6% of the population, or about 70,000 of its residents. For 72,440 residents, neither English nor French, the official languages of Canada, is their mother tongue, though most have knowledge of English (148,975), French (160), or both (12,885). Most immigrants become citizens, as 11,155 immigrants were not Canadian citizens as of the Canada 2006 Census.

The primarily urban district has a low proportion of Aboriginal residents compared to other parts of Canada, with just 625 people identifying themselves of such descent. It is also home to 70,070 residents who identify themselves as visible minorities, more than half of which are Chinese Canadians and about 20% are Black Canadians.

At the 2006 census, the participation rate of residents in the work force was 71.3%, and the electoral district unemployment rate was 5%, below the national average of 6.3%.

The district was the second-largest electoral district in Canada by population, next to Brampton West which had 170,422 residents at the 2006 census. It was the 64th largest in 2001, with a population of 111,276, but had the greatest population growth from 2001 to 2006, about 52.5%.

==Boundaries==
According to Elections Canada, Oak Ridges—Markham consisted of that part of the Regional Municipality of York composed of:

(a) the Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville;

(b) the part of the Township of King south of Highway No. 9;

(c) the part of the Town of Richmond Hill lying north and east of a line drawn from the western town limit east along Gamble Road, south along Yonge Street and east along Elgin Mills Road East to the eastern town limit; and

(d) the part of the City of Markham lying north and east of a line drawn from the western town limit east along 16th Avenue, south along McCowan Road, east along Highway No. 7, and south along 9th Line to the southern town limit.

2004 change is based on redistributed results. Conservative change is compared to a combination of Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative votes.

==Redistribution==
Because Oak-Ridges Markham had a population 115.60% over the Ontario quota (Canada&#x27;s most populous riding) it was substantially affected by the 2012 electoral district redistribution. The district was renamed King—Vaughan, which consists of the Township of King south of Highway 9, along with the part of the City of Vaughan north of Major Mackenzie Drive, west of Highway 400, and north of Rutherford Road east of Hwy 400.

The part that is the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville and in the City of Markham east of Ontario Highway 48 / Main Street Markham/ York Regional Road 68 was incorporated into the new Markham—Stouffville riding. The part in the town of Richmond Hill is part of the new Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill riding. Finally, the part in the city of Markham west of the above-mentioned roads is part of the new Markham—Unionville riding, which is different from the previous riding of the same name.

<doc id="629989" wikidata="Q905984" url="?curid=629989" title="The Lounge Lizards">
<text>The Lounge Lizards were an eclectic No Wave musical group founded by saxophonist John Lurie and his brother, pianist Evan Lurie, in 1978. Initially known for their ironic, tongue-in-cheek take on jazz, The Lounge Lizards eventually became a showcase for John Lurie&#x27;s sophisticated compositions straddling jazz and many other genres. They were active until about 1998 with the Lurie brothers as the only constant members, though many leading New York City based musicians were members of the group. 

The group&#x27;s name was borrowed from American slang. A lounge lizard is typically depicted as a well-dressed man who frequents the establishments in which the rich gather with the intention of seducing a wealthy woman with his flattery and deceptive charm.

==History==
At its founding, the band consisted of John Lurie and Evan Lurie, guitarist Arto Lindsay, bassist Steve Piccolo, and percussionist Anton Fier. Though partly inspired by jazz, John Lurie said he used guitarists in the band &quot;to foil the music when it gets too jazzlike&quot;. They released a self-titled album on EG Records in 1981 and produced by Teo Macero. The album included two Thelonious Monk covers, but as one critic noted, &quot;the two aforementioned Monk covers seem a strange choice when you actually hear the band, which has more in common with sonic experimentalists like Ornette Coleman or Sun Ra.&quot; John Lurie later said this version of the band broke up due in part to creative tensions exacerbated by conflicts with EG Records executives, and in part due to his growing belief &quot;that what we were doing was maybe phony&quot;.

A transitional version of the band for about a year in 1982-83 featured the Lurie brothers, with bassist Tony Garnier, trombonist Peter Zummo and drummer Dougie Bowne, augmented by other musicians depending on availability (e.g., bassist Fred Hopkins substituted for Garnier during a short tour). This version of the Lounge Lizards did not record a studio album. 

By the mid-1980s, a new line-up included bassist Erik Sanko, trombonist Curtis Fowlkes, guitarist Marc Ribot, saxophonist Roy Nathanson, and percussionists Bowne and E.J. Rodriguez. This group recorded various live and studio albums and showcased John Lurie&#x27;s increasingly sophisticated and multi-layered compositions. John Lurie noted their music in this era was inspired by diverse sources such as &quot;James Brown to Balinese music, from Varèse to Coltrane&quot;.

The band&#x27;s 1987 music video &quot;Big Heart&quot; was featured on the adult animation &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot;. 

In 1998, the band released &quot;Queen of All Ears&quot; on John Lurie&#x27;s &quot;Strange and Beautiful Music&quot; label and had added Steven Bernstein, Michael Blake, Oren Bloedow, David Tronzo, Calvin Weston, and Billy Martin. &quot;The Lizards&#x27; music isn&#x27;t jazz,&quot; said Fred Bouchard of &quot;JazzTimes&quot;, &quot;but it is intelligent and rhythmically and harmonically interesting (it ain&#x27;t rock either, in other words) and, despite the ultra-hip trappings, it has an almost innocent directness that can transcend stylistic prejudice.&quot;

The Lounge Lizards have been inactive since about 2000. John Lurie has been occupied with painting, while Evan has worked on &quot;The Backyardigans&quot;, a children&#x27;s show that highlights multiple musical genres.

<doc id="629992" wikidata="Q3502922" url="?curid=629992" title="Sudbury (federal electoral district)">
<text>Sudbury is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1949. The district is one of two serving the city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario.

==Geography==

Sudbury electoral district consists of the part of the City of Greater Sudbury bounded on the west and south by the Greater Sudbury city limits, and on the north and east by a line drawn from the western city limit of Greater Sudbury east along the northern limit of the former Town of Walden, north, east and south along the limits of the former City of Sudbury, west along Highway 69 and Regent Street, south along Long Lake Road, west along the northern boundary of the Township of Broder, southwest along Kelly Lake, and south along the eastern limit of the former Town of Walden to the southern city limit of Greater Sudbury.

==History==
Sudbury electoral district was created in 1947 from part of the Nipissing riding. It consisted initially of the city of Sudbury and a part of the territorial district of Sudbury.

In 1952, the boundaries were narrowed significantly to include only the city of Sudbury, the geographic township of McKim and the town of Copper Cliff. The rest of the original Sudbury riding was incorporated into the new riding of Nickel Belt.

In 1976, Sudbury&#x27;s growth in population led the riding to shrink further. It now included only the northern half of the city; the city&#x27;s southern half was incorporated into Nickel Belt.

In 1996, it was redefined as the part of the City of Sudbury north of a line drawn from east to west along Highway 69, south along Long Lake Road, and west along the north boundary of the geographic Township of Broder.

In 2003, the riding expanded geographically to include the former town of Walden, now part of the city of Greater Sudbury. The remainder of the city continues to be part of the Nickel Belt riding.

This riding was left unchanged after the 2012 electoral redistribution.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will gain Nickel Centre, Wanup and the remainder of the former city of Sudbury from Nickel Belt, and will loses all of its territory west of Highway 144 to the new riding of Sudbury East—Manitoulin—Nickel Belt. These changes will come into effect upon the calling of the 2025 Canadian federal election.

== Demographics ==
&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 77.9% White, 12.3% Indigenous, 3.8% Black, 2.8% South Asian

Languages: 70.0% English, 16.6% French, 1.7% Italian

<doc id="629996" wikidata="Q7870362" url="?curid=629996" title="USS Inaugural (AM-242)">
<text>USS &quot;Inaugural&quot; (AM-242) was an fleet minesweeper. The &quot;Admirable&quot; class was the largest and one of the most successful classes of U.S. minesweepers ordered during World War II. &quot;Inaugural&quot; was launched on 1 October 1944 and commissioned less than three months later. After seeing combat in the Pacific Theater, she was decommissioned in 1946 and spent two decades in mothballs.

In 1968, she was set up as a museum ship in St. Louis, Missouri. In the Great Flood of 1993, &quot;Inaugural&quot; was ripped from her mooring, ran aground, and rolled on her side a mile downstream. As of December 2017, the hulk was still sitting on the Missouri side of the river. In the autumn of 2021, a historic low level of the Mississippi River allowed the hulk to become visible.

==Operations==
&quot;Inaugural&quot; was built and launched by the Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Company of Winslow, Washington. She was commissioned on 30 December 1944.

Following shakedown off the California coast, &quot;Inaugural&quot; sailed on 14 March 1945 for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived eight days later. For the next two months, the minesweeper performed patrol and escort duties between Hawaii and the islands of the western Pacific. She was at Saipan on 22 May and departed that day with a convoy bound for Okinawa, site of the last and largest amphibious operation of the Pacific war. After a voyage enlivened by several attacks on suspected submarines, the convoy reached Okinawa on 30 May.

During the desperate struggle for Okinawa, &quot;Inaugural&quot; patrolled the seas around the island group, often firing at Japanese aircraft as they made suicidal efforts to destroy the ships supporting the invasion force. Except for 19–24 July, when the ship put to sea to ride out the great typhoon, &quot;Inaugural&quot; remained in the dangerous waters around Okinawa until 30 August 1945.

With the war over, she steamed to the waters around Japan and Korea for minesweeping operations that were a necessary prelude to occupation. She swept the approaches to Jinsen, Korea, in September, and later cleared mines in waters off Nagasaki and Sasebo, Japan. &quot;Inaugural&quot; proceeded to Okinawa where she received needed equipment from 14 to 24 October, and then returned to minesweeping around the Japanese home islands.

The minesweeper sailed on 24 December for the United States, via Saipan and Pearl Harbor, and arrived at San Pedro, California, on 7 February 1946. Sailing again on 11 March, she proceeded to Galveston, Texas, and decommissioned there on 9 September 1946. She was reclassified MSF-242 on 7 February 1955. &quot;Inaugural&quot; entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Texas Group, where she remained until struck from the Navy List on 1 March 1967 and sold.

Overall, &quot;Inaugural&quot; cleared 82 mines and was awarded two battle stars for service during World War II.

==Museum ship==

In 1968, &quot;Inaugural&quot; was towed to St. Louis and established as a floating museum. The vessel was designated as a National Historic Landmark on 14 January 1986, as one of two surviving &quot;Admirable&quot;-class minesweepers used in the Pacific during World War II, the other being the USS &quot;Hazard&quot;.

On 1 August 1993, during flooding of the Mississippi River, &quot;Inaugural&quot; broke loose from her moorings at the Gateway Arch. The ship suffered a breach in her hull, took on water, and rolled on her port side. She sank on the Missouri side of the river, half a mile south of the Poplar Street Bridge. She has since remained in that position, partially submerged. Plans to salvage the wreck in one piece and restore it were deemed unfeasible. The ship was determined a total loss. &quot;Inaugural&quot;″s Landmark designation was withdrawn on 7 August 2001, because she had ceased to meet the criteria. In January 2013, the river dropped so low that one may walk up to the ship. Scrapping work was set to begin in January, but river levels rose again. She is still in the same location with a few pieces of metal missing from the start of scrapping. As of October 2021, she is still sitting where she came to rest and can be seen when the river is at or below average level.

<text>Joseph Nieuwendyk ( ; born September 10, 1966) is a Canadian former National Hockey League (NHL) player. He was a second round selection of the Calgary Flames, 27th overall, at the 1985 NHL Entry Draft and played 20 seasons for the Flames, Dallas Stars, New Jersey Devils, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Florida Panthers. He is one of only 11 players in NHL&#x27;s history to win the Stanley Cup with three or more different teams, winning titles with Calgary in 1989, Dallas in 1999 and New Jersey in 2003. A two-time Olympian, Nieuwendyk won a gold medal with Team Canada at the 2002 winter games. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011 and his uniform number 25 was honoured by the Flames in 2014. He was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2014. In 2017, he was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

An accomplished box lacrosse player, Nieuwendyk led the Whitby Warriors to the 1984 Minto Cup national junior championship before focusing exclusively on hockey. He played university hockey with the Cornell Big Red where he was a two-time All-American. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year in 1988 after becoming only the second first-year player to score 50 goals. He was a four-time All-Star, won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy in 1995 for his leadership and humanitarian work, and was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner in 1999 as the most valuable player of the postseason. He played 1,257 games in his career, scoring 564 goals and 1,126 points.

Chronic back pain forced Nieuwendyk&#x27;s retirement as a player in 2006. He then began a new career in management, acting first as a consultant to the general manager with the Panthers before moving onto the Maple Leafs where he was an assistant to the general manager. He was the general manager of the Dallas Stars between 2009 and 2013. He most recently worked as a pro scout and advisor for the Carolina Hurricanes, until resigning his contract on April 30, 2018.

==Early life==
Nieuwendyk was born on September 10, 1966, in Oshawa, Ontario, and grew up in Whitby. He is the youngest of four children to Gordon and Joanne Nieuwendyk, who immigrated to Canada from the Netherlands in 1958. Gordon owned a car repair shop in Whitby. Joe grew up in a sporting family. His brother Gil was a box lacrosse player, while his uncle Ed Kea and cousin Jeff Beukeboom also played in the National Hockey League (NHL). Growing up, his best friend was future NHL teammate Gary Roberts.

He played both hockey and lacrosse growing up and the latter considered his better sport. At one point, Nieuwendyk was considered the top junior lacrosse player in Canada. He earned a spot with the Whitby Warriors junior A team at the age of 15, and was named the most valuable player of the Minto Cup tournament in 1984 where he led the Warriors to the national championship. The Ontario Lacrosse Association later named its junior A rookie of the year award after Nieuwendyk.

==Playing career==

===College===
Nieuwendyk went undrafted by any Ontario Hockey League team, so he played a season of junior B for the Pickering Panthers in 1983–84. Eligible for the 1984 NHL Entry Draft but unselected, he chose to attend Cornell University where he played hockey and lacrosse for the Big Red. He was named the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) hockey rookie of the year in 1984–85 after scoring 39 points in 23 games. At the 1985 NHL Entry Draft, the Calgary Flames selected him in the second round, 27th overall, with a pick obtained that day in a trade with the Minnesota North Stars for Kent Nilsson. The disappointment in Calgary over the trade of Nilsson resulted in some criticism of Nieuwendyk&#x27;s selection, famously leading to a local newspaper to question the moves with the headline &quot;Joe Who?&quot;

Returning to Cornell for the 1985–86 season, Nieuwendyk chose to give up lacrosse in order to focus on hockey. He was named an ECAC first team All-Star in 1985–86 and an NCAA All-American after scoring 42 points in 21 games. In his final season at Cornell, he was named the team&#x27;s most valuable player and led the ECAC in scoring with 52 points. He was again named an ECAC All-Star and NCAA All-American, and a finalist for the 1987 Hobey Baker Award.

Nieuwendyk chose to forgo his senior year in favour of turning professional. In 81 games with Cornell, Nieuwendyk scored 73 goals and 151 points, both among the highest totals in the school&#x27;s history. His number 25 jersey was retired by Cornell in 2010, shared with Ken Dryden&#x27;s number 1 as the first such numbers retired by the hockey team, and believed the first in any sport in the school&#x27;s varsity sports history. In 2011, he was named one of the 50 greatest players in ECAC history.

===Calgary Flames===
Once his junior season at Cornell ended, Nieuwendyk joined the national team for five games before turning professional with the Flames. He made his NHL debut on March 10, 1987, against the Washington Capitals and scored his first NHL goal against goaltender Pete Peeters. He appeared in nine regular season games in the 1986–87 NHL season, scoring five goals and one assist, and appeared in six playoff games. Playing his first full season in 1987–88, he captured the attention of the sports media by scoring 32 goals in his first 42 games to put him on a pace to surpass Mike Bossy&#x27;s rookie record of 53 goals. He finished two goals short of Bossy&#x27;s record, but led the team with 51 goals and was the second first-year player to score at least 50 goals in one season. He played in his first NHL All-Star Game, was named to the All-Rookie Team and was voted the winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top rookie.

Nieuwendyk again scored 51 goals in 1988–89 and marked the 100th of his career in his 144th career game. At the time, he was the third fastest player to reach the milestone, behind Bossy (129 games) and Maurice Richard (134 games), and was the third player in league history to score 50 goals in each of his first two seasons (Bossy and Wayne Gretzky). He led the league with 11 game-winning goals and set a Flames franchise record on January 11, 1989, when he scored five goals in one game against the Winnipeg Jets. He appeared in his second of three-consecutive All-Star Games. In the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs, he scored 10 goals and four assists to help the Flames win their first- and only -Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. In the clinching game against the Montreal Canadiens, he set up Lanny McDonald&#x27;s final NHL goal with a quick pass after receiving the puck from Håkan Loob.

A 45-goal season in 1989–90 was enough for Nieuwendyk to lead the team in goal scoring for the third consecutive season. He missed he first 11 games of the 1991–92 NHL season after suffering a knee injury during a summer evaluation camp for the 1991 Canada Cup. Nieuwendyk began the season as the 12th captain in the Flames franchise history. He was limited to 22 goals and 56 points on the season, but scored his 200th career goal on December 3, 1991, against the Detroit Red Wings. His 230th career goal, scored against the Tampa Bay Lightning on November 13, 1992, established a Flames franchise record for career goals (since broken).

Nieuwendyk entered the 1995–96 season unhappy with his contract status. Unable to come to terms with the Flames, he had gone to arbitration, and was awarded a contract worth C$1.85 million, but insisted on renegotiating the deal into a long-term contract extension. He refused an offer of a three-year, $6 million contract from the Flames, and as the dispute dragged on, chose not to join the team when the season began. He remained a holdout until December 19, 1995, when the Flames traded him to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Jarome Iginla and Corey Millen.

===Dallas Stars===

The Stars immediately signed Nieuwendyk to a new deal worth US$11.3 million over five years. Bob Gainey, the team&#x27;s general manager, hoped that the acquisition of Nieuwendyk would help the franchise, which had relocated from Minnesota three years previous, establish its place in Dallas. He scored 14 goals and 32 points in 52 games with the Stars to finish the 1995–96 season.

He improved to 30 goals in 1996–97 despite missing the first month of the season with fractured rib cartilage. A 39-goal season followed, but he was again sidelined by injury after appearing in only one game of the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs. In the opening game of the Stars&#x27; first-round series against the San Jose Sharks, he suffered a torn ACL as a result of a check by Bryan Marchment. The injury required two knee surgeries to repair and six months to heal, which caused him to miss the beginning of the 1998–99 NHL season.

He finished the regular season with 28 goals and 55 points in 67 games, and added 11 goals and 10 assists in the 1999 Stanley Cup playoffs to help the Stars win the first Stanley Cup in their franchise history. Six of his playoff goals were game winners, and he was voted the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the playoffs. Injuries again limited him in 1999–2000. He missed ten games due to a bruised chest then suffered a separated shoulder a week after his return that kept him out of the lineup for several weeks. He played only 47 regular season games, but added 23 more in the playoffs as the Stars reached the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals. They lost the series in six games to the New Jersey Devils, however.

Nieuwendyk played in his 1,000th career game on January 20, 2002, against the Chicago Blackhawks. Two months later, on March 19, 2002, he was traded to the Devils, along with Jamie Langenbrunner, in exchange for Jason Arnott, Randy McKay and a first round selection in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft.

===New Jersey, Toronto and Florida===
New Jersey, who had won the Stanley Cup in 2000 and reached the finals the following year, acquired Nieuwendyk for their playoff run in 2002. He scored 11 points in 14 regular season games for the Devils following the trade, but New Jersey was eliminated in the first round of the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs by the Carolina Hurricanes. He reached two offensive milestones in 2002–03. He scored his 500th career goal on January 17, 2003, against Carolina&#x27;s Kevin Weekes. On February 23, he scored his 1,000th point in a win over the Pittsburgh Penguins. He and the Devils reached the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, but he suffered a hip injury in the sixth game of the Eastern Conference Final that prevented him from appearing in the championship series. The Devils defeated the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the final, capturing the franchise&#x27;s third Stanley Cup. For him, it was his third title with his third different team.

The Toronto Maple Leafs signed Nieuwendyk to a one-year contract for the 2003–04 season. He scored 22 goals for Toronto in a season marred by abdominal and back injuries that limited him to 64 games played. After scoring two goals in the decisive Game 7 opening round series victory against the Ottawa Senators, a groin injury that forced him out of the lineup for much of Toronto&#x27;s second-round series loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. He signed another one-year deal for 2004–05, but the season was cancelled due to a labour dispute that was feared would mark the end of his 38-year-old career.

When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, the Florida Panthers sought to bolster their lineup with veteran players.They signed both Nieuwendyk and Roberts, who had played together in Calgary and Toronto and wanted to finish their careers together, to two-year, $4.5 million contracts. He appeared in 65 games during the season, scoring 26 goals and 56 points. He appeared in 15 games in 2006–07 before chronic back pain forced him onto injured reserve. After missing 14 games, he announced his retirement on December 7, 2006.

==International play==
As a member of the Canadian national junior team at the 1986 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Nieuwendyk scored five goals in seven games to help Canada win a silver medal. His 12 points in the tournament tied him for third in scoring for Team Canada and fourth overall in the tournament. One year later, he joined the senior national team for the Calgary Cup, a four-team exhibition tournament that served as a preview event for the 1988 Winter Olympics. He scored a goal in each of the first two games, losses to the United States and Czechoslovakia, for the Canadian team that won the bronze medal. He joined the senior team again for the 1990 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships, but appeared in only one game after suffering a knee injury. He was invited to Team Canada&#x27;s summer camp for the 1991 Canada Cup tournament but suffered a knee injury that caused him to miss the entire tournament.

NHL players were first allowed to participate in the Olympic ice hockey tournament in 1998. Nieuwendyk was among the players named to join Canada&#x27;s &quot;dream team&quot;. He scored two goals and three assists in six games, but was one of several Canadian players stopped by Czech goaltender Dominik Hašek in a shootout loss in the semifinals. Canada then dropped a 3–2 decision to Finland to finish fourth. He played alongside Brendan Shanahan and Theoren Fleury on Canada&#x27;s checking line at the 2002 Olympic tournament. He scored one goal and helped Canada win its first Olympic hockey gold medal in 50 years.

==Playing style==
Cliff Fletcher, who drafted him into the NHL, described Nieuwendyk as being a &quot;pre-eminent two-way guy who had 50-goal seasons&quot;, adding that &quot;he had a great stick around the net, he had a great shot, he saw the ice well, he could skate, he had the size – he had everything you needed to have. History has indicated that wherever he went, the team was competitive. The more that was on the line in big games, the better Joe played.&quot; He was an offensive centre in Calgary and power play specialist, able to withstand the physical punishment required to stand in front of the net and battle defencemen for the puck. He led the NHL in power play goals in 1987–88 with 31 and finished in the top ten on four other occasions. Wayne Gretzky, who also played box lacrosse in his youth, argued that the skills Nieuwendyk learned dodging opposing players in that sport aided his development as a hockey player. Nieuwendyk was regarded as a top faceoff man, a skill that Team Canada relied on during the Olympics. He was a checking-line centre at the 2002 Olympics, relied on for his defensive and faceoff abilities.

Nieuwendyk was regarded as a leader throughout his career. He was the captain of the Flames for four seasons, and his teammates in Dallas praised him as a player who would help guide the younger players as they began their careers. His presence was considered an important factor in New Jersey&#x27;s 2003 Stanley Cup championship. Devils&#x27; general manager Lou Lamoriello praised his impact both on and off the ice: &quot;Certainly (the tangibles were) the quality player he was even at that time, how good he was defensively as well as always finding a way to get big goals. It was also about how good he was on faceoffs. And the intangibles, which are really more tangible than anything, are what he brought in the locker room from leadership and unselfishness. It was obvious that when he didn&#x27;t play he was still so active in his support. He&#x27;s genuine in every sense of the word. He was a true team player.&quot; He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011, and his uniform number 25 was honoured by the Calgary Flames on March 7, 2014, as he was named to the organization&#x27;s &quot;Forever a Flame&quot; program.

==Management career==
Remaining in hockey following the end of his playing career, Nieuwendyk joined the Florida Panthers&#x27; front office as a consultant to general manager Jacques Martin in 2007. He left the Panthers after one year to join the Maple Leafs as special assistant to general manager Cliff Fletcher in 2008. He served as assistant general manager for the silver medal-winning Canadian national team at the 2009 World Championships, and on June 1, 2009, was named general manager of the Dallas Stars. His ability to make moves was at times limited by the financial difficulty of team owner Tom Hicks. Among his decisions in his first two seasons as general manager was to allow popular former captain Mike Modano to leave the organization after 22 years with the franchise in 2010. He stated that such moves were difficult, as he played with Modano and considered him a friend. He was released as Stars&#x27; general manager at the conclusion of the 2012–13 NHL season as team owner Tom Gaglardi stated that the team wanted to &quot;take this organization in a different direction&quot;. On September 3, 2014, the Carolina Hurricanes announced they had hired him as a pro scout and advisor. He resigned from his position with Carolina on April 30, 2018.

==Personal life==
Nieuwendyk and his wife Tina have two daughters and one son.
Jackson Nieuwendyk is presently playing in Penticton, British Columbia with the Penticton Vees of the British Columbia Hockey League. He is committed to play in the NCAA with Canisius College in the Buffalo, New York area for the 2023–2024 NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey season.

In 1995, while a member of the Flames, Nieuwendyk won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy given annually to the player &quot;who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and who has made a significant humanitarian contribution to his community&quot;. He was honoured by the league for his contributions to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), and was a spokesman and honorary chairman of the Foothills Hospital Foundation. He remained active with the SPCA after his trade to Dallas, and following the September 11 attacks, organized a charity softball game that raised $115,000 for charitable groups in the aftermath of the attack. While a member of the Maple Leafs during the lockout, he participated in a charity hockey game organized by cancer survivor and former NHL player Keith Acton that raised $30,000 for cancer and leukemia charities in southern Ontario.

<text>Community radio is a radio service offering a third model of radio broadcasting in addition to commercial and public broadcasting.

Community stations serve geographic communities and communities of interest. They broadcast content that is popular and relevant to a local, specific audience but is often overlooked by commercial (or) mass-media broadcasters. Community radio stations are operated, owned, and influenced by the communities they serve. They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals, groups, and communities to tell their own stories, to share experiences and, in a media-rich world, to become creators and contributors of media.

In many parts of the world, community radio acts as a vehicle for the community and voluntary sector, civil society, agencies, NGOs and citizens to work in partnership to further community development aims, in addition to broadcasting. There is legally defined community radio (as a distinct broadcasting sector) in many countries, such as France, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and Ireland. Much of the legislation has included phrases such as &quot;social benefit&quot;, &quot;social objectives&quot; and &quot;social gain&quot; as part of the definition. Community radio has developed differently in different countries, and the term has somewhat different meanings in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States, Canada and Australia, where freedom of speech laws and de facto realities differ.

==Vision, philosophy, and status==
Modern community radio stations serve their listeners by offering a variety of content that is not necessarily provided by the larger commercial radio stations. Community radio outlets may carry news and information programming geared toward the local area (particularly immigrant or minority groups who are poorly served by major media outlets). Specialized musical shows are also often a feature of many community radio stations. Community and pirate stations (in areas where they are tolerated) can be valuable assets for a region. Community radio stations typically avoid content found on commercial outlets such as Top 40 music, sports and &quot;drive-time&quot; personalities. A meme used by members of the movement is that community radio should be 10 percent radio and 90 percent community. This means that community radio stations should focus on getting the community talking and not solely on radio (which is a technological process); the social concerns of community radio are stressed over radio &quot;per se&quot;. There is also a distinction drawn in contrast to mainstream stations, which are viewed as pandering to commercial concerns or the personalities of presenters.

===Conceptions of community in the literature===
Communities are complex entities, and what constitutes the &quot;community&quot; in community radio is subject to debate which varies by country. &quot;Community&quot; may be replaced by terms such as &quot;alternative&quot;, &quot;radical&quot; or &quot;citizen&quot; radio. In sociology, a &quot;community&quot; has been defined as a group of interacting people living in a common location.

Community radio has been built around the ideals of access and participation. Stations have been run by locals, typically to serve a local audience. However, the internet&#x27;s availability and popularity has encouraged many stations to podcast and/or stream and audio and make it available globally.

===Models===
Two philosophical approaches to community radio exist, although the models are not mutually exclusive. One emphasizes service and community-mindedness, focusing on what the station can do for the community. The other stresses involvement and participation by the listener.

In the service model, locality is valued; community radio, as a third tier, can provide content focused on a more local or particular community than a larger operation. Sometimes, though, providing syndicated content not already available within the station&#x27;s service area is viewed as public service. Within the United States, for example, many stations syndicate content from groups such as Pacifica Radio (such as &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;) on the basis that it provides content not otherwise available (because of a program&#x27;s lack of appeal to advertisers—in Pacifica&#x27;s case, due to its politically controversial nature).

In the access (or participatory) model, the participation of community members in producing content is viewed as a good in itself. While this model does not necessarily exclude a service approach, there is some disagreement between the two.

==By country==

===Australia===
Community broadcasting is Australia&#x27;s third media sector, formally represented by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA). In January 2012, there were 359 licensed community radio stations (including remote indigenous services).
A 2002 report found that 20,000 Australians (or 0.1 percent of the population) were involved as volunteers in the community radio sector on a regular basis, and volunteers account for more than $145 million in unpaid work each year. Nationally, more than 7 million Australians (or 45 percent of people over 15) listen to community radio each month.

The role of community broadcasting in Australia, according to CBAA, is to provide a diverse range of services meeting community needs in ways unmet by other sectors. Community broadcasting is sustained by the principles of access and participation, volunteerism, diversity, independence and locality.

Community radio stations may be specialized music stations, represent local music and arts or broadcast talks and current-affairs programs representing alternative, indigenous Australian, environmental, feminist or gay and lesbian interests (filling perceived gaps in commercial or government radio content). 53 percent of community radio stations serve an array of communities of interest, including indigenous and ethnic groups, people with a print disability, young people, older people, the arts/fine music, religious, and the gay and lesbian communities. The remaining stations provide a service which may be described as generalist: addressing the interests of communities in particular areas, but also addressing a range of specialized interests.

Community broadcasting, more than any other form of media in Australia, shapes and reflects the national character in all its diversity. The sector is unique in its capacity to provide fresh programming by and for indigenous, ethnic and RPH communities. Community broadcasting stations have a strong commitment to local news and information, the promotion of local and national music, arts and culture and providing training in media skills.

When a not-for-profit community group applies to the regulating body (the Australian Communications and Media Authority) for a community broadcasting licence, it specifies the community interest it intends to serve. Licensees are selected by the regulator on the basis of suitability and on the merits of the licence application and the capacity to serve identified community interests. Upon grant of a five-year renewable licence each station is required to continue to serve the community interest for which the licence was granted. The Broadcast Services Act establishes the requirement to continue to represent the licensed community of interest and the requirement to encourage participation from the licensed community of interest in the provision and selection of programs as key conditions of the licence. Provisions for Temporary Community Radio Licences in the Act allow, where spectrum is available, for aspirant community groups to develop their facilities and financial and programming models before the regulator considers making a permanent licence available.

===Austria===

In Austria, community radio was introduced in 1990 through a pirate radio movement. Regular licensed broadcasts began in 1998. Commercials are not permitted, so stations are primarily operated as non-profit NGOs. There are 14 community radio stations operating in the country.

===Bangladesh=== 

Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication (BNNRC) has been struggling for the last 12 years to open up the community media (including Community Radio, Community Television and Community film) and giving focus on its vital role as voices of the voiceless people. BNNRC has been addressing the community radio &amp; community TV access issue for over a decade, almost since its emergence in the year 2000.

BNNRC is in special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. BNNRC has been promoting advocacy to the government in relation to community radio with other organizations since its emergence in 2000.

The objective of BNNRC&#x27;s Community Radio intervention is to address social issues (such as poverty and social exclusion) at the community level, empower marginalized rural groups and catalyze democratic processes and ongoing development efforts.

At the moment, positive and supportive condition is prevailing in our country. Because; Bangladesh Government has already acknowledged the importance of community radio and announced the Community Radio Installation, Broadcast and Operation Policy. Bangladesh is the 2nd country in South Asia in formulating policy for Community Radio. Now 14 community radio stations are on-air in the country, aiming to ensure empowerment and right to information for the rural community. They are broadcasting altogether 120 hours program per day on information, education, local entertainment and development motivation activities. Around 536 youth women and youth are now working with those Stations throughout the country as rural broadcasters.

The prime role of community radio is giving a voice to people who do not have access to mainstream media to express their views on community development. Promoting the right to communicate, expediting the process of informing the community, assisting the free flow of information and acting as a catalyst of change are major tasks achievable by community radio. It also upholds creative growth and democratic spirit at the community level.

As a result, the Ministry of Information of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh announced the Community Radio Installation, Broadcast and Operation Policy 2008. Under this policy, the Ministry of Information approved 14 community radio stations for the first time in Bangladeshi history. To ensure the free flow of information to the people, the government enacted the Right to Information Act 2009. Community radio stations are a strong step in empowering rural people.

The reality of today is that the bondage between the community people and local-level community radio stations are getting strengthened day-by-day. Community Radio has now become their part of life. Community Radio becomes the instrument for the livelihood battle of the rural people.

BNNRC established the Community Media News Agency (CMNA), Community Media Academy (CMA) and Monthly Community Media to share development news and building capacity for the Community Media sector in Bangladesh. BNNRC now started advocacy with the Government of Bangladesh to open up community television for development.

Earlier, in the 1st batch on 22 April 2010, Ministry of Information has approved 14 community radio stations, the number stands on 16 by adding more 2 stations in the line soon. 14 community radio stations ushered a new era by rural broadcasting 106 hours programs daily within a listeners&#x27; community of 4.6 million of 13 upazila of the country. These programs reflect the rights and scopes of the disadvantaged community people. This neo-media has produced a neo-generation of community radio broadcasters at rural level where a total of 536 youth and youth women are contributing creativity their time, effort and thus taking part in nation-building process. The initiating organizations received approval for primary set up of community radio stations in the 2nd phase are:

Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication represents the community media sector to Government, Industry, Regulatory Bodies, Media and Development Partners in Bangladesh. The reality of today is that the bondage between the community people and local-level community radio stations are getting strengthened day-by-day. Community Radio has now become their part of life. Community Radio becomes the instrument for the livelihood battle of the rural people.

BNNRC has been struggling for the last 12 years to open up the community media (including Community Radio, Community Television and Community film) and giving focus on its vital role as voices of the voiceless people and has already established the Community Media News Agency (CMNA), Community Media Academy (CMA) and Monthly Community Media to share development news and building capacity for the Community Media sector in Bangladesh.

Community radio is considered an alternative, effective mass media for the rural disadvantaged population to express their thoughts in their own voice and their own style.
===Benin===
Radio is the primary mass medium in Benin and sub-Saharan Africa. Of its 55 radio stations, 36 are community stations with programming ranging from news and sports to music and quiz shows. Although there is a need for such stations, it is difficult for them to succeed due to financial and structural problems and a lack of funding.

===Bolivia===
A well-known example of community radio in Bolivia was the tin miners&#x27; radio. Funded by trade union dues and operated mainly at the local and regional level, there were more than 25 such radio stations between 1960 and 1985. Changes in government policy eliminated many unionised mining jobs after 1985 and some radio stations were sold or ceased to exist. In spite of many difficulties, five stations continue to broadcast.

&quot;La Voz del Minero&quot;, &quot;Radio Pío XII&quot;, &quot;RadioVanguardia de Colquiri&quot;, &quot;Radio Animas&quot;, &quot;Radio 21 de Diciembre&quot;, and &quot;Radio Nacional de Huanuni&quot; were some of the most important radio stations created, funded and managed by Bolivian mining workers. In 1949, a station began broadcasting in the mining district of Catavi. During the next 15 years, other districts followed; they bought the equipment, trained young people from their villages, and the workers funded the stations with a percentage of their salaries.

Most of the radio stations began small, with simple equipment. A few received foreign support and evolved into more sophisticated stations, with better equipment. Several built theatres next to their stations, so union meetings could be broadcast live; for example, Radio Vanguardia had a theatre decorated with large murals narrating the story of the Colquiri mining centre. One scene on a mural depicts the attack by Bolivian Air Force planes in 1967 (when the country was under military rule).

During the early 1970s 26 radio stations were in operation, all in the mining districts of the highlands. At the time, the miners&#x27; unions in Bolivia were still powerful and considered among the most politically advanced in Latin America.
In times of peace and democracy the miners&#x27; radio stations were integrated into the daily life of the community, becoming an effective replacement for telephone and postal service.
People would receive their mail through the stations and post messages, which were read several times during the day: calls for a meeting of women from the &quot;Comité de Amas de Casa&quot; (Housewives&#x27; Committee); messages from union leaders about their negotiations with the government in the capital; messages of love between young people; the announcement of a new play by the &quot;Nuevos Horizontes&quot; theater group (often staged on the platform of a big truck, with workers illuminating the scene with their own lamps); and announcements of sport activities, burials, births and festivities.

In times of political upheaval, the union radio stations would become the only trustworthy source of information. As the military captured newspapers, radio and TV stations in the capital and other cities, the only information available would come from the miners&#x27; radio stations. They would join the &quot;cadena minera&quot; (&quot;mining chain&quot;) until the army penetrated the mining camps and mounted an assault on the stations, which were defended (sometimes to the death) by the workers. A film by Bolivian filmmaker Jorge Sanjinés, &quot;The Courage of the People&quot;, reenacts the attack on the mining district of Siglo XX by the army in June 1967. Another film, a documentary by Alfonso Gumucio Dagron and Eduardo Barrios entitled &quot;Voices of the Mine&quot; and produced by UNESCO, describes their political and social importance.
The miners&#x27; radio stations would air reports on the political situation; they would also link for live transmissions when an important sporting or cultural event took place in the mining district. Other than that, each station was fully independent of the others.

The miners&#x27; radio stations were important because of the importance of mining in Bolivia; Bolivian miners were also influential because for several decades they had a powerful means to communicate their ideas. As the importance of mining in Bolivia declined during the 1980s, the unions were weakened and some of the radio stations disappeared (along with their mining districts).

=== Brazil ===

Law No 9612/1998 defines a community radio station as sound stations belonging to non-profit foundations or associations representing a public contained therein, living in a neighborhood or united by a social cause and that the station presents itself as a spokesperson of these people. It has to operate with a maximum power of 25 watts ERP and its tower will have the limit of 30 meters (100&#x27;). These technical characteristics delineate a portion coverage of an urban area, a partial coverage in the municipality. As said, the community broadcaster has a cultural function, there can be no explicit commercial breaks but cultural supports of the content of the grid. Programming times can not be sold to third parties and broadcasting to other stations is prohibited (going against the idea of a &quot;community radio&quot;).

They should be open to divergent opinions and divergent lifestyles regarding each of them. The average radius of reach is 1 km (1000 yards) (covering a village and a neighborhood in particular). The use for the ideological-political end or to present a specific belief is not allowed. An entity that has interest can send the documents to the Statement of Interest Register (CDI). The requests received appeared in the National Grant Plan (PNO), later a notice will be opened with the documents that should be sent. This does not mean that the institution has obtained the radio frequency, there will be a selection process to eliminate the competition. Even if after all it is authorized, it will have to be countersigned 90 days until the release of the National Congress, otherwise the applicant may require a provisional license.

The FM frequencies reserved for the service are 87.5 MHz, 87.7 MHz and 87.9 MHz, however, in some regions of Brazil, community radio stations are reserved in the frequencies 98.3 MHz, 104.9 MHz, 105.9 MHz, 106.3 MHz and 107.9 MHz. The frequency is reserved and licensed only by Anatel, the National Telecommunications Agency of Brazil. The history of the Brazilian community is inclusive in a context of Brazilian redemocratization in the second half of the 1980s. In the struggle to institute the same, a movement began in 1991, organizing itself in the form of a forum, in 1994 the judiciary legalized community radio broadcasts. The largest city in the country, São Paulo because of the lack of frequency, managed to regulate these radio stations only in 2007 through a public notice. Currently are about 34 stations of the genre operating only in 87.5 MHz (different from the frequencies commonly used).

On July 10, 2018, the Federal Senate Plenary approves the power increase from 25 watts to 150 watts, the effective half of a local commercial radio. The senator and author of the bill said it will improve coverage in rural areas where homes are more dispersed. However Anatel may interfere and determine the maximum power that can be transmitted, especially when there are adjacent CRs. The former minister Gilberto Kassab ordered to extinguish on the eve of 2019 more than 130 community radios for irregularities. Minas Gerais was the one that most lost emisoras (27) followed by São Paulo (20), another 22 states lost 1 CR for each one.

It is the most common type of radio broadcasting in Brazil. By 2014 there were 4641 broadcasters, 47% of all radios, being twice the commercial + educational FM and the triple of medium-wave broadcasters.

===Canada===

Community radio stations in Canada often target commercially underserved minority-language communities such as Franco-Ontarians, Acadians, Anglo-Quebecers or First Nations. These stations are often volunteer-run and operated by cooperatives or other not-for-profit corporations. In larger cities, community-oriented programming more commonly airs on campus radio stations, although some cities do have community radio stations as well. Most English-language community stations in Canada are members of the National Campus and Community Radio Association, or NCRA, while most of Canada&#x27;s French language community radio stations are members of either the Association des radiodiffuseurs communautaires du Québec (ARCQ) or the Alliance des radios communautaires du Canada(ARC).

The province with the largest number of community radio stations in Canada is Saskatchewan. The majority of those stations are affiliated with Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation, an aboriginal public radio network.
Community stations are subject to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission&#x27;s (CRTC) community radio policy.

In this policy, the CRTC requires community stations to
* facilitate community access to programming;
* promote the availability of training throughout the community; and
* provide for the ongoing training and supervision of those within the community wishing to participate in programming.

It also requires stations to offer diverse programming that reflects the needs and interests of the community, including:
* music by new and local talent;
* music not generally broadcast by commercial stations;
* spoken word programming; and
* local information.

The CRTC maintains a list of community stations. In Canada, call letters and frequencies are regulated by Industry Canada&#x27;s Spectrum Management.

The CRTC classifies community radio stations as one of two types, with slightly different regulatory requirements. Most stations are classified as &quot;Type B&quot;; however, a community radio station which operates as the sole local media service serving its community — such as an English language community radio station in Quebec, a First Nations radio station or a community radio station in a small town with no other local radio stations at all — is classified as &quot;Type A&quot;, granting it a more flexible set of regulatory and license requirements to accommodate the wider range of community programming interests that such a station needs to serve.

=== Ecuador ===
In Ecuador, many community radio stations are operated by religious groups and include Catholic, Protestant and Baháʼí Faith stations. The amount of community participation and self-management varies. Radio Latacunga was associated with a project in which indigenous organizations were supplied with simple equipment to record weekly programs for broadcast in the early morning. Some indigenous groups operate their own radio stations; these include the Shuar Federation in the tropical rainforest, and the community of Simiatug in Bolívar Province. Unlike in Bolivia, trade-union radio has historically not been influential in Ecuador.

=== Ethiopia ===
Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT), Federal Republic of Ethiopia and World Development Foundation, New Delhi, India signed an agreement on 30 June 2014 for establishing seven Community Radio Stations at Finote Selam, Dilo (Borana), Adola Rede (Guji), Chewaka (Illubabor), Semera, Ari Woreda (Debub Omo) and Uba Debretsehay (in Gamo Gofa zone, Southern Nations, Nationalities and People Region), Ethiopia to serve as an avenue for the free flow of beneficial information aimed at uplifting the plight of the various sectors of the community. The stations were planned to open up possibilities for everyone, especially regular citizens, to express themselves socially, culturally, politically and spiritually, thus preparing each and every member of the community to participate in decision-making.

World Development Foundation, with an active support of different agencies of Government of India and Embassy of India in Ethiopia and especially HE Mr. Sanjay Verma, Ambassador and Mr. Vijay Kumar, Dr. Hari Om Srivastava and MCIT, Ethiopia was able to complete the job and hand over all the Community Radio Stations to MCIT in September 2015.

Milestones
* Signing of Agreement: 30 June 2014
* Opening of Letter of Credit: 28 October 2014
* Dispatch of Material from India/USA/Italy/Spain: Between Dec2014 to Feb 2015. 
* Receipt of material by MCIT and handing over to WDF for installation: June 2015
* Installation and Commissioning at seven sites by WDF and handing over to MCIT: 28 June 2015 to 5 September 2015
* Training of Officers/operational staff: 21 September 2015 to 25 September 2015

Highlights 
* The emphasis has been on using type design for Lay Out, identical equipment and installation to ease the maintenance and procurement of spares. This will also allow the exchange of staff and development of expertise.
* The objective for training was to provide:
* full range of WDF accredited training on the usage of the equipment, hardware and software, programming including hands on training.
* simplified processes for equipment maintenance by the broadcaster&#x27;s trainees in order to maintain the equipment&#x27;s good working condition
* Programming basics and use of Community Radio Station for social, cultural, political and spiritual upliftment of people in the region
* Two local engineers were involved all through the installation.(Grateful to MCIT, Ethiopia)

Achievements
Through its regular operations the community radio shall be able to:
* provide a development forum for the community;
* encourage participatory community development;
* promote active involvement of underprivileged groups such as women and young people;
* intensify the sharing of information within the community;
* encourage innovation in community development;
* increase the free flow of accurate and balanced information to, and within, the community;
* provide a forum for local cultural expression; and improve people&#x27;s access to information in local languages

The Medication Foundation together with the Jimma Community and the Jimma University realized the first community radio station in Ethiopia in 2007. The Community radio station is located in Jimma University (in the south-west of Ethiopia).

===Guatemala===
* There are more than 100 community radio stations operating in Guatemala, but the indigenous communities don&#x27;t have explicit rights to use radio frequencies, though their right to exist is guaranteed by the country&#x27;s Peace Accords.
* Many believe the lack of support for community radio puts the volunteers in a very vulnerable position, and the law puts freedom of expression at risk.

=== Hungary ===

The first community stations began as pirates, broadcasting political free-speech and music programs after the change from socialism. Tilos Rádió in 1991 was the first such station, followed by Fiksz Rádió and Civil Rádió. Since 2004 a new category arose: &quot;kisközösségi&quot; (small community stations), which are low-power stations. By 2010, more than 70 such microstations have begun broadcasting throughout the country. There are village stations, small-town stations, university stations, subcultural and religious stations. In Budapest Cool FM, Első Pesti Egyetemi Rádió and Fúzió Rádió are small community stations. 

===India===

In India the campaign to legitimise community radio began in the mid-1990s, soon after the Supreme Court of India ruled in its judgment of February 1995 that &quot;airwaves are public property&quot;. The judgment inspired several free speech advocates, academics and community members across the country to being a concerted campaign to legitimize community radio in India.

In 1996, a Bangalore-based media advocacy group called VOICES organized a gathering of community radio stakeholders. A declaration calling for the establishment of a third tier of broadcasting, i.e., community broadcasting, was signed. A suggestion that AIR&#x27;s local stations should allocate regular airtime for community broadcasting was put forward. Requests were also made for grant of licences to NGOs and other non-profit making groups for running community radio stations. Subsequently, UNESCO made available a portable production and transmission &quot;briefcase radio station&quot; kit to VOICES to do experimental broadcasts of programmes for a hands-on learning experience towards the objective of setting up an independently run community radio station.

A UNESCO sponsored workshop, hosted by an Andhra Pradesh NGO, Deccan Development Society (DDS) from July 17–20, 2000 in Hyderabad issued the &#x27;Pastapur Initiative&#x27; on community radio that urged the government to take its intentions of freeing broadcasting from state monopoly to its logical conclusion, by making media space available not only to private players but also to communities. This landmark document urged the government to create a three-tier structure of broadcasting in India by adding non-profit community radio to the already existing state-owned public radio and private commercial radio.

Simultaneously, several initiatives had already started working on community radio in terms of production and dissemination of participatory programming. In South India, Deccan Development Society worked with Dalit women&#x27;s collectives to start Sangam Radio, the programmes for which were made by the community, but were &#x27;narrowcast&#x27;, i.e. played back to the community over cassette players at group meetings. Another landmark initiative was jointly set up by VOICES and MYRADA - called Namma Dhwani (Our Voices), where programmes were produced by communities in and around the village of Budikote (about 100 kilometers; 60 miles from Bangalore), and were distributed over the nearest All India Radio station and subsequently over the local cable network. In the west, Kutch Mahila Vikas Sanghatan , a civil society group in Gujarat worked with the women in Kutch District to produce programmes on local developmental and cultural issues, and started broadcasting on the nearest All India Radio Station. In the northern part, Alternative for India Development made programmes with community members in Garhwa block of Jharkhand, and broadcast programmes over the Daltonganj All India Radio Station. Community Groups in Chamba, and Rudraprayag, both in Uttarakhand started producing participatory programmes and broadcast over the World Space Satellite Radio network.
Kumaon Vani radio station was set up by The Energy and Resources Institute in March 2010 in Nainital district of Uttarakhand with the aim of bringing together communities across several villages in the Kumaon region. It was established to use radio as a tool to promote sustainable development among the local farming community. It broadcasts content that is relevant to the people of the area that is overlooked by commercial media.

By early 2003, the government of India released the first set of community radio guidelines drafted by Dr. Hari Om Srivastava and also the technology to be used , but unfortunately, restricted eligibility to educational institutions only. Marginalized and voiceless communities continued to remain outside the ambit of the then released community radio policy guidelines. Dr Sreedher Ramamurthy, the then Director of Audio visual Research centre at Anna University launched Anna FM as India&#x27;s first campus &quot;community&quot; radio station. And, as per the latest Community Radio Policy Guidelines (2006), Anna FM falls well within the definition of Community Radio. Launched on 1 February 2004, it is presently run by the Department of Media Sciences, Anna university. Programmes are produced by students as well as community. Anna university station was launched on 1 February 2004 . Commonwealth of Learning and UNESCO sponsored an international meet on community radio at Anna university in December 2004 . All the applicants to CR in India as well as representatives from 13 countries attended. Government of India studied the working of this station along with the change of ruling party in India Several of the lessons learnt at Anna CR were incorporated in the Policy document in 2006. Practitioners and community radio advocates continued to push the government towards expanding the mandate of the community radio sector to include communities living in rural, remote and hilly areas of the country.

On 16 November 2006, the government of India implemented new Community Radio Guidelines, which permit NGOs, educational institutions and agricultural institutions to own and operate community radio stations. By 30 November 2008, there were 38 operational community radio stations in the country. Of these, two are run by NGOs and the rest by educational institutions.

The first community-based radio station licensed to an NGO (as distinct from campus-based radio) was launched on 15 October 2008, when Sangham Radio, licensed to Deccan Development Society, in Pastapur village, Medak district, Andhra Pradesh state went on the air at 11:00 am. Therefore, Sangham Radio, based on the policy guidelines, is second community radio station of India. Sangham Radio, which broadcasts on 90.4 MHz, is licensed to the Deccan Development Society (DDS) (an NGO which works with women&#x27;s groups in approximately 75 villages in Andhra Pradesh). The community radio station is managed by &quot;General&quot; Narsamma and Algole Narsamma.

Under the 2006 community radio policy, any not-for-profit &quot;legal entity&quot;—except individuals, political parties (and their affiliates), criminal and banned organizations—can apply for a CR license. The licence entitles them to operate a 100-watt (Effective Radiated Power) radio station, with a coverage area of approximately a 12-km (7 mile) radius. A maximum antenna height of 30 meters is allowed. Community radio stations are expected to produce at least 50 percent of their programmes locally, as much as possible in the local language or dialect. The stress is on developmental programming, although there is no explicit ban on entertainment. News programmes are banned on community radio in India (as they are on commercial FM radio). However, the government has clarified that certain categories of news are permitted on radio, including sports news and commentaries, information on traffic and weather conditions, coverage of cultural events and festivals, information on academic events, public announcements pertaining to utilities such as electricity and the water supply, disaster warnings and health alerts. Five minutes of advertising per hour is allowed on community radio. Sponsored programs are not allowed, except when the program is sponsored by the government at the local or state level.

In a given license area, the Wireless Planning and Coordination (WPC) wing of the MoCIT reserves only three frequencies for community radio. This reservation is informally done and the WPC does not have any official communication or guidelines with respect to spectrum allocation for community radio in the FM band. The WPC follows a channel separation of 800 kHz in India. This means that if a radio station is allotted 90.4 MHz in a given license area, then the next available frequency is 91.2 MHz. Further, once a radio station is allotted a frequency by the WPC, that particular frequency is blocked for a radius of 100 kilometers (60 miles).

Activists and community workers from across the country have banded together under the aegis of the Community Radio Forum of India to coordinate training and support for community radio stations, and to work for a more proactive community radio policy. The Community Radio Forum, India, was registered as a Society and Trust on 26 February 2008. Members from the Community Radio Forum participate in screening committee meetings to screen potential applicants, and the organization is also recognized as a national level self-regulatory body in the Draft Broadcast Bill as published by the Government of India.

By 1 July 2010, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting announced that 715 applications for CR licenses had been received, including 104 under the old campus-radio guidelines. 231 Letters of Intent were issued (including 63 under the old guidelines). Grant of Permission Agreements were signed with 102 applicants, and 68 community radio stations were on the air. 107 applications were rejected, and 377 applications were being processed. By 1 February 2012, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had received a total of 991 community radio licence applications. Grant of Permission Agreements had been signed with 161 applicants and 126 community radio stations were on air.

From April 1, 2012, the Ministry of Communications and IT has hiked the spectrum fees to Rs. 91,000 - a fivefold increase from the previous annual fee of Rs. 19,700. This move provoked widespread protest from functional community radio stations, advocacy bodies like Community Radio Forum and Community Radio Association of India, and even the Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcast has gone on record to say that his Ministry&#x27;s views were not sought before the decision was taken. He also expressed concern that many organizations would find it impossible to pay the increased spectrum royalty charges. The Community Radio Forum has already boycotted one policy consultation held by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, on 9th and 10 May. Several community radio stations also observed a &#x27;Day of Silence&#x27; on 9 May, where the spectrum fee hike was announced, protest songs were broadcast, community views were invited, and transmission was switched off for the rest of the day.
After pressure from various stakeholders, the Ministry for Information and Communication Technology (MoCIT) announced that the spectrum fee and royalty charges would be rolled back to annual fee of Rs. 19,700. The spectrum fee was Rs. 19,700 annually, till September 2013, at which time the Ministry was to re-examine the matter.

According to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, the status on 25 April 2023 of Community Radio in India was:
* No. of applications received so far, from 2004 to 05 Feb 2013 (including 104 under 2002 CR Guidelines): 1200(?)
* Letters of Intent (LOI) issued: 428
* Grant of Permission of Agreement (GOPA) signed: 191
* Operational Community Radio Stations: 420
* Number of applications rejected: 545
* Applications under process: 227

The complete list of operational community radio stations in India is published on the website of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Additionally, Jose Jacob, of the National Institute of Amateur Radio in Hyderabad has also published a list of available stations.

To see details and descriptions on each of the individual operational community radio stations, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting prepares a compendium on Community radio, which is also available and published on their website.

Community Radio and Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia (CEMCA): from 2007 onwards, with CEMCA being the implementing agency and DR R Sreedher as its director, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India organized more than 40 awareness workshops throughout the country to create an atmosphere for getting more organisations to apply for a license for CR. By June 2012, the government had received more than one thousand applications and 400 of them got the Letters of intent LOI. While the initial phase saw more stations in educational campuses an analysis of the 400 LOIs brings out the fact that two thirds of the LOIs have gone to civil society organisations. They find it difficult to launch the station, due to lack of funds, training, human resources and the difficulty in getting the frequency cleared by the WPC wing of the Ministry of Telecommunications. In July 2014, Government of India announced a scheme to support community radio stations and allocated 100 crore for this purpose.

Community Radio Association
Community Radio Association was formed soon after the first Sammelan of CR stations in 2011 in Delhi. 58 stations expressed their interest in April 2011 for the formation of an association, wherein people working on the ground, can represent their communities and bring the voices of the voiceless to the fore. A paper was prepared and circulated among operational stations and a consensus on the role of the association, its structure, objectives etc. were arrived at. A society was registered in Delhi in July 2011, under the Societies Registration Act.

The salient features of the CRA are:
* Only representatives of functional CR stations are its voting members
* It has been registered as an All India Body with 12 members from nine different states signing the MOA
* CRA works in a decentralized manner with Zonal and State Chapters. Each Chapter is empowered to organize workshops, events in line with CRA&#x27;s objectives.

Even though CRA is only two years old its contribution and the role of its members in building an environment in favour of community Radio has been substantive.

CRA has been organizing events/workshops and has been sharing the experiences of its members across the globe. Some of its members have been representing the movement in international forums and reiterating the power of the Community radio. They have been supporting the growth of this movement in countries of both Europe and Africa.

Since CRA is a member-based organisation, all its members have been running community radio stations, in diverse regions and dialects, together they bring to the table a mine of resources and experience.

The strength of CRA is its network of experienced radio practitioners, who manifest the mandate of the Community Radio. This organisation is a true reflection of India&#x27;s diversity, the multitude of languages and dialects, the varied topography and history. It is the only network in this sector, which is totally democratic and allows space for dissent, as there is nothing homogeneous about any community.

If we try to total up the experience of each member radio station- which are now 92 in all, then it would amount to a huge figure. The reach of this radio station together is to over 4 million people.

In 2013, CRA has organized two zonal workshops – South and West Zones and three state level experience sharing meets – Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Kerala. There have been workshops and meetings in all the 
zones, wherein members have come together and shared their challenges and achievements.

With a mission to promote, encourage, support and facilitate all functional and desirous Community Radio Stations in India and abroad, CRA has already hosted seven workshops for the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The seven Community Radio Awareness workshops were held at Dibrugarh, Ooty, Goa, Faridabad, Bhubaneswar, Kochi and Jaipur. The participation of the desirous Community Radio Operators was tremendous. The quality and content of the workshops was well thought out, and inspiring. Over 90 percent of the participants gave Letters of Intent on the last day.

CRA led the entire campaign against the rise in the licence fee. Members of the organisation met with the Minister, Mr Kapil Sibbal, personally and handed over the petition that was signed by all its members. CRA worked closely with CRF on this issue, and also organised a meeting with the then Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Ms Ambika Soni, who took up the issue of the hike in fees with the concerned department. Besides this:

* Members of CRA, have been part of the working paper on the Community Radio Support Fund, and contributed extensively to the process. 
* CRA members are part of the screening committee for new stations.
* CRA Members are also part of the Technical committee for Community Radio Support Scheme (CRSS) and their suggestions and inputs have been considered valuable. 
* CRA members were also the pioneers in developing a proposal for the incorporation of a Community Radio Peer Review to strengthen and support the operations of already existing community radio stations through cross learning and sharing. CRA member are also involved in the CR Policy review discussions. 
* Individual members of CRA have worked in various capacities as facilitators, mentors, trainers for other organizations involved in the CR space namely, CEMCA, Ministry of Science and Technology, UNESCO. 
* CRA is working on different training modules for capacity building in CR and disaster management, sustainability, knowledge sharing, mobilizing communities for health care, collaboration on non-formal learning and education programmes.
* CRA member stations have also won awards for their work in integrating technology with Community Radio and several ongoing research are being conducted on the same
* CRA member stations have been invited as speakers to several national and international forums like Bangladesh Community Radio Forum (25–27 February 2012), Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD) 2012, Asia Media Summit (29 May 2012), Cyprus Community Media Center, Nocosia (January 28, 2013, Radiodays Europe radio conference in Berlin 18–19 March 2013, International Association of Women in Radio and Television, seminar on Community Radio and Democracy in South Asia (5 March 2013)

==== Content Exchange and Knowledge Sharing for community radio ====
Indian government has been promoting content exchange especially radio programmes, good practices, case studies etc. to facilitate meaningful utilisation of available resources.

In past two years, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has promoted &quot;EK duniya anEK awaaz&quot; (Edaa) - which is an audio and knowledge exchange portal for Community Radio practitioners in South Asia. Launched in year 2008, Edaa is completing 5 years on 1 September 2013.

Edaa is a web-based service that uploads the content of radio stations. Listening to Bhojpuri or Tamil from villages that don&#x27;t appear even on Google maps, is such an exciting platform that even the ministry mentions this in its press release on future plans for Community Radio. Edaa is South Asia&#x27;s biggest community-produced audio bank and hosts more than 2,900 radio programmes in 28 different South Asian languages categorised under 33 thematic areas. Another online space that supports learning and knowledge exchange between Community Radio stations in India is the Community Media Manch Platform This platform supports collaborations, knowledge sharing and webinars that community radio stations and members of community media can undertake to share their experiences.

===Ireland===
Ireland has had self-described community radio stations since the late 1970s, although it was not until 1995 that the first 11 licensed stations went on the air as part of an 18-month pilot project run by the Independent Radio and Television Commission. Early stations were represented by the National Association of Community-Radio Broadcasters, which in 1988 published a guide to setting up new stations.

There are 24 licensed stations in Ireland. In 2004 the licensed stations formed a co-operative CRAOL as a representative group in 2004, with the stations as shareholders. In 2007, new membership categories were created for aspiring stations, and a &quot;Development Ladder&quot; established to aid new stations in their development. By 2010, there were 42 aspiring stations at various stages of development.
The Broadcasting Act 2009 provided a legal definition of community radio, which previously had been determined by the Community Radio Policy of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (now the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland). The Act also provided for the availability of a 100-day licence (within a 12-month period) for aspiring groups who meet the legal definition.

An Agreement for Mutual Co-operation was established in 2008 by CRAOL; this ensures that the signatories (which include all fully licensed stations) share successful funding applications, training materials and policies. This has led to a significant increase in networking and information-sharing. The agreement also covered the sharing of programming, and a network website facilitates these activities through a resource bank and online programme exchange.

Community radio stations in Ireland encompass stations serving a geographic community or a community of interest (such as campus stations, Christian and Irish-language stations). Accredited training in Community Radio has been available through CRAOL since 2004. The pace of such training has increased since mid-2009, with 95 percent of CRAOL member stations involved. In June 2010 the first Community Radio Conference was held in Croke Park, Dublin.
Stations are located in all four provinces of Ireland; however, coverage is not universal. Dublin has the largest number of stations, and there are significant clusters in north and west Connaught and mid-Munster.

Community radio in Ireland encompasses:
*&quot;Process&quot;: Participation by communities in creation of programming
*&quot;Product&quot;: Service provided to the community through programming supplied

The combination of process and product is determined by the needs of the community, and implemented through a management structure controlled by the community.

===Japan===
Japan has a network of low-power community radio stations across the country. Their most common call sign is JOZZ-XXX-FM.

It was institutionalized in 1992. 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and later, the number of broadcasting stations has increased. Currently (September 2015), about 300 stations exist.

===Jordan===
The first community radio AmmanNet.net was established in 2000 in Jordan on the internet by award-winning Arab journalist Daoud Kuttab as a means of bypassing government restrictions on private, non-governmental radio. In 2005 AmmanNet was licensed as an FM private station in Jordan&#x27;s capital, Amman. The radio paid US$30,000 for a licence. AmmanNet has also been involved in the training of two other community radio stations in Jordan: one in the twin villages of Lib and Mleih, and another as part of King Hussein University in the southern city of Ma&#x27;an. AmmanNet is also involved in training Arab media activists in internet radio. A program was begun to train personnel and launch nine Gulf-based radio stations as part of khaleejnet.net. In January 2008, the name of AmmanNet radio was changed to Al-Balad radio while AmmanNet.net remained as a news website.

Two other community radio stations have been established in Jordan. Yarmouk FM is located at Yarmouk University in Irbed as part of the school&#x27;s Journalism and Mass Communications program. Farah FM is under construction, but has a license to broadcast in Amman and Zarqa (Jordan&#x27;s second-largest city). This station will focus primarily on youth and women&#x27;s issues.

===Philippines===
The best-known community radio network in the Philippines is Radyo Natin (Our Radio). Its stations nationwide broadcast a live Manila feed via satellite; sometimes stations air local programming, cutting the Manila feed. It is considered a community network, because local programs air on different RN stations. Radyo Natin is owned by the Manila Broadcasting Company.

Radyo Natin is the largest network of community radio stations in the Philippines, counting over 150 small FM stations throughout the archipelago from Batanes in the north to Tawi-Tawi in the south.
RN stations are owned and operated by franchise holders, who are public-service-oriented communicators in their own right. With audio streaming, it is possible for the national feed to reach listeners all over the world via the internet; it is hoped that in the near future (), the franchise stations will also be heard worldwide.
Radyo Natin is able to reach audiences that have never been reached before by radio.

Although Radyo Natin is found in the FM band, in the mornings it affiliates with Manila Broadcasting Company&#x27;s flagship station, DZRH, for national news programming.
During the afternoons, Radyo Natin features popular music.

With its studios at the MBC Building in the Star City Complex in Pasay, Radyo Natin sends its signals to its stations by satellite. These stations, in turn, rebroadcast its signals locally.
These individual Radyo Natin stations can, however, &quot;unhook&quot; from the Manila central studios and air events in their own areas at specified times; thus, Radyo Natin is nationwide in coverage but local in nature.

In 2005 a show-cause order containing a cease-and-desist directive from the commissioner of the National Telecommunications Commission was issued to Radyo Natin, forcing the closure of all stations.
In the order against Manila Broadcasting Company, NTC Commissioner Ronald Olivar Solis said that the company is &quot;operating a low power FM station as a commercial broadcasting station without the necessary authority from the Commission.&quot;

===Nepal===

Nepal adopted community radio in 1997 when Radio Sagarmatha (&quot;Sagarmatha&quot; is the Nepalese name for &quot;Mount Everest&quot;), broadcasting on 102.4 MHz, became the first independent public-interest broadcaster in South Asia. It was established by the Nepal Forum of Environmental Journalists (NEFEJ) in May of that year. Radio Sagarmatha is in the front lines of the fights for freedom of expression and the right to information of Nepalese citizens.

, there are more than 150 community radio stations which have been licensed by the Nepalese government. In Nepal, there are no separate policies or laws for community radio. The existing policy and applies to both community and commercial radio stations. Community radio stations have been petitioning the government to introduce different policy and law for community radio stations, whose mottoes are social change and social justice. They have played a role in restoring democracy and changing Nepal to a republic from a monarchy. The rule of law, gender equality, education, health, civics, anti-corruption initiatives, good governance, the environment and day-to-day problems and issues are examined in a different format by the local community radio stations. Community radio enjoys good coverage throughout Nepal, and news is one of its most popular formats. Its first Radio Producer/presenter was Mr. Ghamaraj Luitel, who served Radio Sagarmatha holding different positions in programme and top management for nearly one and one-half decades. He made Radio Sagarmatha very popular through unique radio programmes among its listeners during his 15 years service and left it after playing vital role to develop it as Station Manager for four years. Mr. Luitel led Radio Sagarmatha during the King Gyanendra&#x27;s coup to save independent radio movement playing a role as central spokesperson after February 1, 2005.

Radio Sagarmatha&#x27;s history is interwoven with the gradual loosening of government control over the airwaves in Nepal. From the time of the new constitution in November 1990, the drive to put the station on the air was instrumental in bringing about a new communications environment and a new awareness of the importance and need for independent, public-interest broadcasting.

Mass media in Nepal face barriers; the geography of the country is ill-suited to either mass-circulation print media or coverage by electronic media. Access to newspapers, radio, television and education is limited by poverty; Nepal has a low literacy level, particularly in rural areas and among women. Both print and electronic media are concentrated in urban centers like Kathmandu and are thought to have limited relevance for rural people.

In 1990, Nepal changed from a monarchical non-party system to a parliamentary model. A new constitution enshrined the right to freedom of expression (specifically, the right of every citizen to demand and receive information on any matter of public importance). The expression of basic communication rights in the constitution was followed by more focused policy and practical guidelines: in 1992, a National Communications Policy; in 1993, a National Broadcasting Act and in 1995, broadcast regulations.

Before 1994 radio broadcasting was the exclusive domain of Radio Nepal, the state broadcaster established during the early 1950s. Even after 1990, state governments were slow in relinquishing monopoly control of radio broadcasting. The first independent license was granted in 1997, four-and-a-half years after the initial application.
The battle for this license was long, hard-fought and significant. The main obstacles were an unstable political environment, conservative politicians and bureaucrats disinclined to change and the monolithic presence of Radio Nepal. Between October 1992 (when the application was registered) and May 1997 (when the license was granted), Nepal had four different governments, four ministers and four secretaries of communication. Waged primarily by journalists committed to the cause of free expression and public-interest broadcasting, the fight involved figures of national prominence, professional associations, NGOs, the print media, foreign embassies, UN organizations, and INGOs.

From the outset the main organization vehicle for Radio Sagarmatha (for both the campaign to get a license and to establish a radio station) has been the Nepal Forum of Environmental Journalists, a non-governmental organization and association of journalists. Key international supporters during the establishment phase were UNESCO and DANIDA.

NEFEJ is the current license-holder of Radio Sagarmatha, although the station was officially a joint effort and partnership with three other media-based NGOs: the Himal Association, Worldview Nepal and the Nepal Press Institute. The station was headed by a seven-member board of directors, constituted by NEFEJ. Through NEFEJ bylaws, the board had representation from all four partner NGOs and met monthly to review and plan activities, set policy and provide direction for the station.

In April 1999, Radio Sagarmatha operated with the following staff: a station manager, six full-time producers, two technicians, a music librarian, an engineer, an accountant and an assistant. The station also benefited from the contributions and experience of international supporters. Volunteers are an important part of Radio Sagarmatha&#x27;s programming and operation.
The station&#x27;s programming has given many people the opportunity to have their voices and opinions heard in a public forum. On a daily basis, the station takes listeners into everyday life. The variety of voices and sounds (and its less-than-state-of-the-art equipment) gives the station a different tone from other broadcasters in the region: one of real life, as lived and programmed by real people. Interviewees and those profiled on the station come from a variety of backgrounds and occupations.

Radio Sagarmatha works to present listeners with &quot;a human package&quot;: a combination of issues and entertainment, social discussions and music, and a conduit for the variety of voices and opinion previously unheard on Nepal&#x27;s radio channels. In its programming, the station&#x27;s difference from the state broadcaster and the growing number of Western-style commercial stations is most evident.
Public-affairs journalism and broadcasting are at the heart of Radio Sagarmatha&#x27;s mission and vision for a more responsible press and a more pluralistic society. With a long tradition of folk media and a rich musical heritage, cultural programming is also prominent in the station&#x27;s six-hour daily broadcast.

Other aspects of programming include an initiative named &quot;Safa Radio: The Clean Air Campaign&quot; in which the station works with the Nepal Environmental Scientific Society to measure air pollution in Kathmandu and broadcasts information about the capital&#x27;s air quality. Though prohibited at first from broadcasting news, the station airs summaries of daily news stories in a format mixed with music and broadcasts daily community-news programs. Community access is an important part of programming. There is a daily feature, &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn Now&quot; (in which individuals from the community voice their opinions), vox populi segments, listeners&#x27; letters and feedback recorded by telephone. In late 1998, Radio Sagarmatha formed a partnership with the BBC World Service; 30 minutes of the BBC Nepali service and 30 minutes of world news in English are heard in, respectively, the evening and morning programme blocks. A full list of stations can be found on the website of the Association of Community Radio Broadcasters Nepal.

===New Zealand===

The Association of Community Access Broadcasters (ACAB) is a group of 11 New Zealand community radio stations. The stations, established between 1981 and 2000 and receiving government funding since 1989, broadcast community programming and provide facilities, training and on-air time for individuals and community groups to produce the programming.

The ACAB group is a core component of New Zealand On Air&#x27;s Community Broadcasting Strategy. A government funding pool of approximately $2 million is allocated annually for the 11 stations to produce programming for women, youth, children, ethnic and other minorities and people with disabilities in accordance with section 36(c) of the Broadcasting Act 1989. Individual station funding is allocated on a four-tier system based on audience reach, with each station receiving between $110,000 and $220,000. In return for government funding, ACAB stations have an individual and collective mandate to broadcast programmes for people of a wide range of particular religions, cultures, languages, ages and sexualities. Stations operate independently and locally, making decisions on programming and scheduling by consensus.

Prior to the commercial operations of Radio New Zealand being sold off by the Government in 1996, a number of smaller centres had a local RNZ station that was referred to as a community station.

===Solomon Islands===
The Solomon Islands have a number of community FM radio stations established under a United Nations Development Programme in Isabel Province. In March–June 2009 these were used to strengthen women and youth networking under a peace-building project of the Commonwealth of Learning. The stations are linked to rural email stations of the People First Network. The Don Bosco Technical School has also assisted the Tetere community in operating a radio station near Honiara, and the Solomon Islands Development Trust established a Community Media Centre to expand local capacity.

Soweto has only 1 Community Radio Station called Jozi Fm 105.80 FM. It first went on air in 1995 as Bua Community Station and it was later named Jozi Fm. It is now led by Mr Mpho Mhlongo who is a former presenter and one of the founders of the station.

===South Africa===

Shortly after the end of World War II, the country&#x27;s repressive state policies gave the SABC (South African Broadcasting Corporation) an effective monopoly. For nearly half a century it was the only broadcaster permitted to operate, and faced no independent radio competition on South African territory until the early 1990s&#x27; transition to democracy. The first legally permitted, non-SABC broadcast was that of 1991&#x27;s &quot;Festival Radio&quot; from the campus radio studios at Rhodes University in Grahamstown. An Independent Broadcast Authority was created to oversee the opening of the country&#x27;s airwaves, with small community radio stations being permitted to broadcast for the first time. Applications were discussed in open session, to ensure transparency and accountability. Notable early community broadcasters included Bush Radio in Cape Town and Radio Unitra in Umtata. The Independent Communications Authority (ICASA) now regulates () the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors.

===South Korea===
The South Korean government licensed several low-power community radio stations in 2005. Maximum power is one watt, which covers 5 km (3 miles).

===Sweden===

In Sweden, community radio () was introduced in 1978 with test transmissions; regular broadcasts began the following year. Commercials were not permitted until 1993, but stations are primarily operated as non-profit NGOs. There are 150 community radio stations in the country.

===Syria===
ARTA FM is the first community radio station in Syria broadcasting in three languages: Kurdish, Syriac and Arabic. It was established on 07.06.2013 in Amudah and it has offices in Amudah and Qamishli in Syria.

===Thailand===
Community radio in Thailand grew quickly during the government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, taking advantage of a delay in the establishment of a regulatory authority. Thailand&#x27;s 2,000 to 3,000 community radio stations (often operating unlicensed) have been accused of causing interference with air-traffic-control and other radio stations. However, selected community radio stations have been the target of police crackdowns, causing critics to accuse the government of political interference.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the idea of community-based services can be traced back at least as far as the original concept for BBC local radio in the early 1960s. Thereafter, various land-based unlicensed pirate radio stations (such as East London Radio and Radio AMY: Alternative Media for You) developed the idea further. As pirate stations proliferated during the late 1970s and early 1980s, these stations were joined by those broadcasting specifically to minority immigrant communities (such as the Afro-Caribbean and Asian communities, particularly in cities such as London, Birmingham, Bristol, Gloucester and Manchester). Although &quot;community radio&quot; remains synonymous with &quot;pirate radio&quot; for some people in the UK, most minority immigrant stations focused purely on specific musical genres and were operated (theoretically at least) on a for-profit basis. Community radio services in the UK are operated on a not-for-profit basis, with community ownership and control built into their structure.

Community radio stations were in operation on cable systems from 1978 onwards; mostly situated in new-town areas, they were operated by volunteers. Notable stations included Radio Thamesmead (later RTM Radio) in southeast London, one of the first cable radio stations in the UK, which began on the Rediffusion cable system in the southeast London area in 1978.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the newly formed Radio Authority awarded licences (termed &quot;Incremental&quot; by the outgoing Independent Broadcasting Authority) to a number of new, ex-pirate and cable-based community ventures.
The old breed of community radio stations could raise funds by selling airtime and by receiving donations or grants.

Following an experiment of Access Radio licensed by the former UK broadcast regulator the Radio Authority, legislation was brought to create a new tier of community radio regulated by the RA&#x27;s successor OFCOM. The first station to go on air under this new scheme was 103 The Eye which launched on 1 November 2005, serving the Vale of Belvoir on the Leicestershire/Nottinghamshire border on 103 FM and on the internet. Since 2005 some 300 such stations have been licensed by broadcasting regulator Ofcom operating on five-year licences with the opportunity to renew at the end of each term. Most community radio stations in the UK are on FM, typically at a power of 25 watts. FM community radio stations include Andover Radio, Cambridge 105, Chiltern Voice FM, Preston FM and Penistone FM. A few community radio stations broadcast on AM (medium wave), particularly in rural areas, and some operate online, like Windmill Broadcasting, the UK&#x27;s only radio station broadcasting from a Windmill, in the Broad Eye Windmill, Stafford.

With the introduction of SS-DAB (small-scale Digital Audio Broadcasting licences) from Ofcom, a new breed of community radio stations will launch on DAB in towns and cities around the UK. Stations, such as Blyth&#x27;s South Beach Radio are piloting their formats with web streams in preparation for a DAB launch when the licences become available.

===United States===
In the United States, community radio stations are non-profit, community-based operations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. These stations differ from other public radio outlets in the U.S. by allowing community volunteers to actively participate as program hosts.

Most community stations are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as full-power FM stations, while others, particularly those founded after 2005, operate under the FCC&#x27;s low-power broadcasting rules. Many of the former were founded in the 1960s and 1970s when cultural experimentation (such as the New Left) in the U.S. had a significant following, including those influenced by the philosophy of radio activist Lorenzo Milam. Community radio stations are usually owned by non-profit organizations led by boards of directors and often managed by paid staff who are responsible for business operations and volunteer coordination. Community radio programming involving local volunteers also is offered as part of student-run stations at colleges, universities, and in some cases, high schools.

The National Federation of Community Broadcasters was formed in 1975 as a membership organization for community stations. NFCB publishes handbooks for stations, hosts an annual conference and lobbies on behalf of community radio at the federal level. It was criticized in the 1990s for perceptions it advocated homogenization of programming. The organization has changed leadership since this period. The Grassroots Radio Coalition is a loose network of stations which formed as a reaction against increasing commercialization of public radio and lack of support for volunteer-based stations.

Community radio stations generally have smaller budgets than National Public Radio (NPR) network outlets, due to the smaller audiences attracted by their diversified programming and in turn, a smaller base of listener and business support. Community stations are distinct from NPR stations in that most programming is locally produced by non-professional disc jockeys and producers, whereas traditional public stations rely on national outlets, such as NPR and PRI, for most of their programming. However, some community stations, such as KVNF in Colorado, WMNF in Florida, and WDIY in Pennsylvania, carry NPR in addition to their volunteer-based local origination programming.

==UNESCO==
UNESCO is a strong supporter of community radio and works to increase the viability of local radio stations around the world. In 2001, the Media Development and Society Section produced the &quot;Community Radio Handbook&quot; to share best practices collected through the Organization&#x27;s involvement in the sector. This handbook specifically gives recommendations to radio station personnel in how to engage listeners in democratic debate as a means to forward community development.

The Organization has also supported community radio through the direct training of radio station staff. The &quot;Empowering Local Radio with ICTs&quot; project strengthened the reporting capacities of 59 local radio stations from 2012 to 2018. This UNESCO project was implemented in 10 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, including Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Workshops focused on improving the quality of broadcasts, building widespread correspondent networks and promoting sustainability.

Gender sensitivity training was another important aspect of the project, with many of the best stories pertaining to gender issues being amalgamated in the &quot;On air with rural women&quot; exhibition, opening the celebrations for International Women&#x27;s Day 2018 and being showcased at the 2018 European Development Days.

<text>Brandon—Souris is a federal electoral district in Manitoba, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1953.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2011 Canadian census&quot;

Languages: 85.8% English, 4.3% German, 2.3% Spanish, 1.7% French, 1.4% Chinese
Religions: 67.4% Christian (23.3% United Church, 16.6% Catholic, 12.5% &quot;Other Christian&quot;, 6.1% Anglican, 2.1% Presbyterian, 1.8% Lutheran, 1.6% Baptist), 30.5% None. 
Median income: $30,394 (2010)
Average income: $36,827 (2010) 

==Geography==
The district is in the southwestern corner of the Province of Manitoba. It is bordered by the electoral district of Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa to the north, the electoral district of Portage—Lisgar to the east, the Canada–United States border in North Dakota to the south, and the Province of Saskatchewan to the west.

It includes the communities of Brandon, Cornwallis, Virden, Killarney, Souris and North Cypress.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1952 from the former districts of Brandon and Souris. It has been held by a centre-right party for all but one term of its existence. This tradition was broken in 1993 when massive vote-splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and take the riding. However, the seat reverted to form in 1997 when the PCs reclaimed it. The PCs and their successors, the modern Conservatives, have held the seat ever since. While Brandon has some Liberal and NDP support, it is not enough to overcome the conservative bent in the more rural areas of the riding.

This riding lost territory to Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa and gained territory from Portage—Lisgar during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

===Members of Parliament===
This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<doc id="630014" wikidata="Q1417205" url="?curid=630014" title="Battle of Mons">
<text>The Battle of Mons was the first major action of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in the First World War. It was a subsidiary action of the Battle of the Frontiers, in which the Allies clashed with Germany on the French borders. At Mons, the British Army attempted to hold the line of the Mons–Condé Canal against the advancing German 1st Army. Although the British fought well and inflicted disproportionate casualties on the numerically superior Germans, they were eventually forced to retreat due both to the greater strength of the Germans and the sudden retreat of the French Fifth Army, which exposed the British right flank. Though initially planned as a simple tactical withdrawal and executed in good order, the British retreat from Mons lasted for two weeks and took the BEF to the outskirts of Paris before it counter-attacked in concert with the French, at the Battle of the Marne.

==Background==
Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914 and on 9 August, the BEF began embarking for France. Unlike Continental European armies, the BEF in 1914 was exceedingly small. At the beginning of the war, the German and French armies numbered well over a million men each, divided into eight and five field armies respectively; the BEF had in two corps of entirely professional soldiers made up of long-service volunteer soldiers and reservists. The BEF was probably the best trained and most experienced of the European armies of 1914. British training emphasised rapid-fire marksmanship and the average British soldier was able to hit a man-sized target fifteen times a minute, at a range of with his Lee–Enfield rifle. This ability to generate a high volume of accurate rifle-fire played an important role in the BEF&#x27;s battles of 1914.

The Battle of Mons took place as part of the Battle of the Frontiers, in which the advancing German armies clashed with the advancing Allied armies along the Franco-Belgian and Franco-German borders. The BEF was stationed on the left of the Allied line, which stretched from Alsace-Lorraine in the east to Mons and Charleroi in southern Belgium. The British position on the French flank meant that it stood in the path of the German 1st Army, the outermost wing of the massive &quot;right hook&quot; intended by the Schlieffen Plan (a combination of the and deployment plans), to pursue the Allied armies after defeating them on the frontier and force them to abandon northern France and Belgium or risk destruction.

The British reached Mons on 22 August. In the afternoon of that same day arrived a message from the French Fifth Army commander, General Charles Lanrezac, sent to Field Marshal Sir John French requesting the BEF to turn right to attack von Bülow&#x27;s advancing flank. The French Fifth Army, located on the right of the BEF, was engaged with the German 2nd and 3rd armies at the Battle of Charleroi. French refused, instead agreeing to hold the line of the Condé–Mons–Charleroi Canal for twenty-four hours, to prevent the German 1st Army from threatening the French left flank. The British spent the day digging in along the canal. 

==Prelude==

===British preparations===

At the Battle of Mons the BEF had some 80,000 men, comprising the Cavalry Division, an independent cavalry brigade and two corps, each with two infantry divisions. I Corps was commanded by Sir Douglas Haig and was composed of the 1st and 2nd divisions. II Corps was commanded by Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien and consisted of the 3rd and 5th divisions. Each division had and in three brigades of four battalions. Each division had twenty-four Vickers machine guns – two per battalion – and three field artillery brigades with fifty-four 18-pounder guns, one field howitzer brigade of eighteen 4.5-inch howitzers and a heavy artillery battery of four 60-pounder guns.

II Corps, on the left of the British line, occupied defensive positions along the Mons–Condé Canal, while I Corps was positioned almost at a right angle away from the canal, along the Mons–Beaumont road (see map). I Corps was deployed in this manner to protect the right flank of the BEF in case the French were forced to retreat from their position at Charleroi. I Corps did not line the canal, which meant that it was little involved in the battle and the German attack was faced mostly by II Corps. The dominant geographical feature of the battlefield, was a loop in the canal, jutting outwards from Mons towards the village of Nimy. This loop formed a small salient which was difficult to defend and formed the focus of the battle.
The first contact between the two armies occurred on 21 August, when a British bicycle reconnaissance unit encountered a German force near Obourg and Private John Parr became the first British soldier to be killed in the war. The first substantial action occurred on the morning of 22 August. At the 4th Royal Irish Dragoons laid an ambush for a patrol of German lancers outside the village of Casteau, to the north-east of Mons. When the Germans spotted the trap and fell back, a troop of the dragoons, led by Captain Charles Hornby gave chase, followed by the rest of his squadron, all with drawn sabres. The retreating Germans led the British to a larger force of lancers, whom they promptly charged and Hornby became the first British soldier to kill an opposing soldier in the Great War, fighting on horseback with sword against lance. After a further pursuit of a few miles, the Germans turned and fired upon the Irish cavalry, at which point the dragoons dismounted and returned fire. Private E. Edward Thomas, a cavalryman and drummer, is reputed to have fired the first shot of the war for the British Army, hitting a German trooper.

That same day, having used British reconnaissance planes along with Lanrezac&#x27;s messaging to his army staff, the BEF&#x27;s chief of intelligence, Colonel George Macdonogh, warned Sir John French that three German army corps were advancing straight against them. The field marshal chose to ignore these claims, instead proposing to advance towards Soignies.

===German preparations===
Advancing towards the British was the German 1st Army, commanded by Alexander von Kluck. The 1st Army was composed of four active corps (II, III, IV, and IX corps) and three reserve corps (III, IV and IX reserve corps), although only the active corps took part in the fighting at Mons. German corps had two divisions each, with attendant cavalry and artillery. The 1st Army had the greatest offensive power of the German armies, with a density of per of front, or about ten per .

Late on 20 August, General Karl von Bülow, the 2nd Army commander, who had tactical control over the 1st Army while north of the Sambre, held the view that an encounter with the British was unlikely and wished to concentrate on the French units reported between Charleroi and Namur, on the south bank of the Sambre; reconnaissance in the afternoon failed to reveal the strength or intentions of the French. The 2nd Army was ordered to reach a line from Binche, Fontaine-l&#x27;Eveque and the Sambre next day to assist the 3rd Army across the Meuse by advancing south of the Sambre on 23 August. The 1st Army was instructed to be ready to cover Brussels and Antwerp to the north and Maubeuge to the south-west. Kluck and the 1st Army staff expected to meet British troops, probably through Lille, which made a wheel to the south premature. Kluck wanted to advance to the south-west to maintain freedom of manuoeuvre and on 21 August, attempted to persuade Bülow to allow the 1st Army to continue its manoeuvre. Bülow refused and ordered the 1st Army to isolate Maubeuge and support the right flank of the 2nd Army, by advancing to a line from Lessines to Soignies, while the III and IV reserve corps remained in the north, to protect the rear of the army from Belgian operations southwards from Antwerp.
On 22 August, the 13th Division of the VII Corps, on the right flank of the 2nd Army, encountered British cavalry north of Binche, as the rest of the army to the east began an attack over the Sambre river, against the French Fifth Army. By the evening the bulk of the 1st Army had reached a line from Silly to Thoricourt, Louvignies and Mignault; the III and IV reserve corps had occupied Brussels and screened Antwerp. Reconnaissance by cavalry and aircraft indicated that the area to the west of the army was free of troops and that British troops were not concentrating around Kortrijk (Courtrai), Lille and Tournai but were thought to be on the left flank of the Fifth Army, from Mons to Maubeuge. Earlier in the day, British cavalry had been reported at Casteau, to the north-east of Mons. A British aeroplane had been seen at Louvain (Leuven) on 20 August and on the afternoon of 22 August, a British aircraft en route from Maubeuge, was shot down by the 5th Division. More reports had reached the IX Corps, that columns were moving from Valenciennes to Mons, which made clear the British deployment but were not passed on to the 1st Army headquarters. Kluck assumed that the subordination of the 1st Army to the 2nd Army had ended, since the passage of the Sambre had been forced. Kluck wished to be certain to envelop the left (west) flank of the opposing forces to the south but was again over-ruled and ordered to advance south, rather than south-west, on 23 August. 

Late on 22 August, reports arrived that the British had occupied the Canal du Centre crossings from Nimy to Ville-sur-Haine, which revealed the location of British positions, except for their left flank. On 23 August, the 1st Army began to advance north-west of Maubeuge, to a line from Basècles to St. Ghislain and Jemappes. The weather had turned cloudy and rainy, which grounded the 1st Army all day, despite an improvement in the weather around noon. News that large numbers of troops had been arriving at Tournai by train were received and the advance was suspended, until the reports from Tournai could be checked. The IX Corps divisions advanced in four columns against the Canal du Centre, from the north of Mons to Roeulx and on the left (eastern) flank, met French troops at the canal, which was thought to be the junction of the British and French forces. The corps commander, General von Quast, had ordered an attack for to seize the crossings, before the halt order was received. The two III Corps divisions were close to St. Ghislain and General Ewald von Lochow ordered them to prepare an attack from Tertre to Ghlin. In the IV Corps area, General Friedrich Sixt von Armin ordered an attack on the canal crossings of Péruwelz and Blaton and ordered the 8th Division to reconnoitre from Tournai to Condé and to keep contact with 2 (HKK 2, II Cavalry Corps).

==Battle==

===Morning===
At dawn on 23 August, a German artillery bombardment began on the British lines; throughout the day the Germans concentrated on the British at the salient formed by the loop in the canal. At the first German infantry assault began, with the Germans attempting to force their way across four bridges that crossed the canal at the salient. Four German battalions attacked the Nimy bridge, which was defended by a company of the 4th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers and a machine-gun section led by Lieutenant Maurice Dease. Advancing at first in close column, &quot;parade ground formation&quot;, the Germans made easy targets for the riflemen, who hit German soldiers at over , mowing them down by rifle, machine-gun and artillery fire. So heavy was the British rifle fire throughout the battle that some Germans thought they were facing batteries of machine-guns.

The German attack was a costly failure and the Germans switched to an open formation and attacked again. This attack was more successful, as the looser formation made it harder for the Irish to inflict casualties rapidly. The outnumbered defenders were soon hard-pressed to defend the canal crossings and the Royal Irish Fusiliers at the Nimy and Ghlin bridges only held on with piecemeal reinforcement and the exceptional bravery of two of the battalion machine-gunners. At the Nimy bridge, Dease took control of his machine gun after the rest of the section had been killed or wounded and fired the weapon, despite being shot several times. After a fifth wound he was evacuated to the battalion aid station, where he died. Private Sidney Godley took over and covered the fusilier retreat at the end of the battle but when it was his time to retreat he disabled the gun by throwing parts into the canal then surrendered. Dease and Godley were awarded the Victoria Cross, the first awards of the First World War. An equally brave attempt was made by Captain Theodore Wright of the Royal Engineers, who attempted to blow up five of the bridges that crossed the canal in a three mile run. He managed to destroy the Jemappes pass but while setting up charges at Mariette he was struck in the head by a projectile fragment and had to retreat. Having retreated for a small while, he nonetheless tried again protected by the cover fire of the Northumberland Fusiliers. However, he slipped and fell in the canal, being saved by a comrade and forced to give up the whole endeavour. For this action he was also awarded a Victoria Cross. Wright would be killed in action the following month at Vailly.

To the right of the Royal Fusiliers, the 4th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, were equally hard-pressed by the German assault on the salient. Greatly outnumbered, both battalions suffered many casualties but with reinforcements from the Royal Irish Regiment, from the divisional reserve and support from the divisional artillery, they managed to hold the bridges. The Germans expanded their attack, assaulting the British defences along the straight reach of the canal to the west of the salient. The Germans used the cover of fir plantations that lined the northern side of the canal and advanced to within a few hundred yards of the canal, to rake the British with machine-gun and rifle fire. The German attack fell particularly heavily on the 1st Battalion, Royal West Kent Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, which despite many casualties, repulsed the Germans throughout the day.

===Retreat===
By the afternoon, the British position in the salient had become untenable; the 4th Middlesex had suffered casualties of and killed or wounded. To the east of the British position, units of the German IX Corps had begun to cross the canal in force, threatening the British right flank. At Nimy, Private Oskar Niemeyer had swum across the canal under British fire to operate machinery closing a swing bridge. Although he was killed, his actions re-opened the bridge and allowed the Germans to increase pressure against the 4th Royal Fusiliers.

Having returned from Valenciennes, Commander-in-Chief Sir John French was still convinced that an advance could soon be made, however, by the 3rd Division was ordered to retire from the salient, to positions a short distance to the south of Mons and a similar retreat towards evening by the 5th Division to conform. By nightfall, II Corps had established a new defensive line running through the villages of Montrœul, Boussu, Wasmes, Paturages and Frameries. The Germans had built pontoon bridges over the canal and were approaching the British positions in great strength. News had arrived that the French Fifth Army was retreating, dangerously exposing the British right flank and at on 24 August, II Corps was ordered to retreat south-west into France to reach defensible positions along the Valenciennes–Maubeuge road. Sir John finally accepted that an advance would not be able to take place and admitted that a retreat had to be made quickly, else the consequences would be irreparable for the BEF.

The unexpected order to retreat from prepared defensive lines in the face of the enemy, meant that II Corps was required to fight a number of sharp rearguard actions against the Germans. For the first stage of the withdrawal, Smith-Dorrien detailed the 15th Brigade of the 5th Division, which had not been involved in heavy fighting on 23 August, to act as rearguard. On 24 August they fought various holding actions at Paturages, Frameries and Audregnies. During the engagement at Audregnies the 1st Battalions of the Cheshire and Norfolk regiments halted the German advance from Quiévrain and Baisieux until the morning of 25 August despite being outnumbered and suffering ruinous losses, and with the support of the 5th Brigade artillery, they also inflicted many casualties on the advancing German regiments. An evening roll call of the Cheshires 1st Battalion, who had not received a withdrawal order, indicated that their establishment had been reduced by almost 80 per cent. Their refusal to fall back without orders led Smith-Dorrien to later state that on reflection the 1st Battalion, Cheshires together with the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s regiment had &quot;saved the BEF&quot;.

At Wasmes, elements of the 5th Division faced a big attack; German artillery began bombarding the village at daybreak, and at infantry of the German III Corps attacked. Advancing in columns, the Germans were immediately met with massed rifle and machine-gun fire and were &quot;mown down like grass&quot;. For a further two hours, soldiers of the Northumberland Fusiliers, 1st West Kents, 2nd Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, 2nd Battalion, Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment, held off German attacks on the village, despite many casualties and then retreated in good order to St. Vaast. On the extreme left of the British line, the 14th and 15th brigades of the 5th Division were threatened by a German outflanking move and were forced to call for help from the cavalry. The 2nd Cavalry Brigade, along with the 119th Battery Royal Field Artillery (RFA) and L Battery RHA, were sent to their aid. Dismounting, the cavalry and the two artillery batteries screened the withdrawal of the 14th and 15th brigades in four hours of intense fighting.

===German 1st Army===
On 23 August, the 18th Division of IX Corps advanced and began to bombard the British defences near Maisières and St. Denis. Part of the 35th Brigade, which contained large numbers of Danes from Northern Schleswig, got across the canal east of Nimy with few casualties and reached the railway beyond in the early afternoon but the attack on Nimy was repulsed. The 36th Brigade captured bridges at Obourg against determined resistance, after which the defenders of Nimy gradually withdrew; the bridges to the north were captured at and the town stormed. Quast ordered the 18th Division to take Mons and push south to Cuesmes and Mesvin. Mons was captured unopposed, except for a skirmish on the southern fringe and by dark, the 35th Brigade was in the vicinity of Cuesmes and Hyon. On higher ground to the east of Mons, the defence continued. On the front of the 17th Division, British cavalry withdrew from the canal crossings at Ville-sur-Haine and Thieu and the division advanced to the St. Symphorien–St. Ghislain road. At the divisional commander ordered an enveloping attack on the British east of Mons, who were pushed back after a stand on the Mons–Givry road.

By reports from the IV, III and IX corps revealed that the British were in St. Ghislain and at the canal crossings to the west, as far as the bridge at Pommeroeuil, with no troops east of Condé. Intelligence reports from 22 August, had noted heading through Dour towards Mons and on 23 August, had been seen on the road to Genlis south of Mons, with more troops arriving at Jemappes. To the north of Binche, the right flank division of the 2nd Army had been forced back to the south-west by British cavalry. In the early afternoon, the II Cavalry Corps reported that it had occupied the area of Thielt–Kortryk–Tournai during the night and forced back a French brigade to the south-east of Roubaix. With this report indicating that the right flank was clear of Allied troops, Kluck ordered III Corps to advance through St. Ghislain and Jemappes on the right of IX Corps and for IV Corps to continue towards Hensis and Thulies; IV Corps was already attacking at the Canal du Centre, II Corps and IV Reserve Corps were following on behind the main part of the army.

III Corps had to advance across meadows to an obstacle with few crossings, all of which had been destroyed. The 5th Division advanced towards Tertre on the right, which was captured but then the advance on the railway bridge was stopped by small-arms fire from across the canal. On the left flank, the division advanced towards a bridge north-east of Wasmuel and eventually managed to get across the canal against determined resistance, before turning towards St. Ghislain and Hornu. As dark fell, Wasmuel was occupied and attacks on St. Ghislain were repulsed by machine-gun fire, which prevented troops crossing the canal except at Tertre, where the advance was stopped for the night. The 6th Division was counter-attacked at Ghlin, before advancing towards higher ground south of Jemappes. The British in the village stopped the division with small-arms fire, except for small parties, who found cover west of a path from Ghlin to Jemappes. These isolated parties managed to surprise the defenders at the crossing north of the village, with the support of a few field guns around after which the village was captured. The rest of the division crossed the canal and began a pursuit towards Frameries and Ciply but stopped as dark fell.

IV Corps arrived in the afternoon, as the 8th Division closed on Hensies and Thulin and the 7th Division advanced towards Ville-Pommeroeuil, where there were two canals blocking the route. The 8th Division encountered the British at the northernmost canal, west of Pommeroeuil and forced back the defenders but then bogged down in front of the second canal, under machine-gun fire from the south bank. The attack was suspended after night fell and the British blew the bridge. The 7th Division forced the British back from a railway embankment and over the canal, to the east of Pommeroeuil but was pushed back from the crossing. Small parties managed to cross by a footbridge built in the dark and protected repair parties at the blown bridge, which allowed troops to get across and dig in south of the canal, on either side of the road to Thulin.

Late in the day, II Corps and IV Reserve Corps rested on their march routes at La Hamaide and Bierghes, after marching respectively, behind the front, too far behind to take part in the battle on 24 August. In the mid-afternoon of 23 August, IV Corps was ordered to rest, as reports from the front suggested that the British defence had been overcome and the 1st Army headquarters wanted to avoid the army converging on Maubeuge, leaving the right (western) flank vulnerable. In the evening, Kluck cancelled the instruction, after reports from IX Corps reporting that its observation aircraft had flown over a column long, moving towards Mons along the Malplaquet road. Two more columns were seen on the Malplaquet–Genly and the Quevy–Genly roads, a large force was seen near Asquillies and cavalry was found further east, which showed that most of the BEF was opposite the 1st Army. It was considered vital that the second canal crossings were captured along the line, as had been achieved by IX and part of III corps. IV Corps was ordered to resume its march and move the left wing towards Thulin but it was already engaged at the canal crossings. The III and IX corps&#x27; attack during the day, had succeeded against &quot;a tough, nearly invisible enemy&quot; but the offensive had to continue, because it appeared that only the right flank of the army could get behind the BEF.

The situation remained unclear at the 1st Army headquarters in the evening, because communication with the other right flank armies had been lost and only fighting near Thuin by VII Corps, the right-flank unit of the 2nd Army had been reported. Kluck ordered that the attack was to continue on 24 August, past the west of Maubeuge and that II Corps would catch up behind the right flank of the army. IX Corps was to advance to the east of Bavay, III Corps was to advance to the west of the village, IV Corps was to advance towards Warnies-le-Grand further to the west and II Cavalry Corps was to head towards Denain, to cut off the British retreat. During the night there were several British counter-attacks but none of the German divisions was forced back over the canal. At dawn IX Corps resumed its advance and pushed forwards against rearguards until the afternoon, when it stopped the advance due to uncertainty about the situation on its left flank and the proximity of Maubeuge. At cavalry reports led Quast to resume the advance, which was slowed by the obstacles of Maubeuge and III Corps congesting the roads.

On III Corps&#x27; front to the west, the 6th Division attacked Frameries at dawn, which held out until and then took La Bouverie and Pâturages, after which the British began to retreat; the division turned west towards Warquignies and the 5th Division. St. Ghislain had been attacked by the 5th Division behind an artillery barrage, where the 10th Brigade had crossed the canal and taken the village in house-to-house fighting, then reached the south end of Hornu. A defensive line had been established by the British along the Dour–Wasmes railway, which stopped the German advance and diverted the 9th Brigade until when the British withdrew. The German infantry were exhausted and stopped the pursuit at Dour and Warquignies. During the day Kluck sent liaison officers to the corps headquarters, stressing that the army should not converge on Maubeuge but pass to the west, ready to envelop the British left (west) flank.

IV Corps&#x27; headquarters had ordered its divisions to attack over the canal at dawn but found that the British had blown the bridges and withdrawn. Repairs took until and the 8th Division did not reach Quiévrain until noon; the 7th Division reached the railway at Thuin during the morning and then took Élouges late in the afternoon. As the 8th Division moved on, the vanguard was ambushed by British cavalry before an advance to Valenciennes could begin and then attacked a British rearguard at Baisieux, which then slipped away to Audregnies. The rest of the division skirmished with French Territorials south-west of Baisieux. The IV Corps&#x27; attack forced back rearguards but inflicted no serious damage, having been slowed by the bridge demolitions at the canals. The cavalry divisions had advanced towards Denain and the had defeated troops of the French 88th Territorial Division at Tournai and then reached Marchiennes, after a skirmish with the 83rd Territorial Division near Orchies.

===Air operations===
German air reconnaissance detected British troops on 21 August, advancing from Le Cateau to Maubeuge, and on 22 August from Maubeuge to Mons, as other sources identified halting places, but poor communication and lack of systematic direction of air operations led to the assembly of the BEF from Condé to Binche being unknown to the Germans on British reconnaissance flights had begun on 19 August with two sorties and two more on 20 August, which reported no sign of German troops. Fog delayed flights on 21 August but in the afternoon German troops were seen near Kortrijk and three villages were reported to be burning. Twelve reconnaissance sorties were flown on 22 August and reported many German troops closing in on the BEF, especially troops on the Brussels–Ninove road, which indicated an enveloping manoeuvre. One British aircraft was shot down and a British observer became the first British soldier to be wounded while flying. By the evening Sir John French was able to discuss with his commanders the German dispositions near the BEF which had been provided by aircraft observation, the strength of the German forces, that the Sambre had been crossed and that an encircling move by the Germans from Geraardsbergen was possible. During the battle on 23 August, the aircrews flew behind the battlefield looking for troop movements and German artillery batteries.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===


By nightfall on 24 August, the British had retreated to what were expected to be their new defensive lines, on the Valenciennes–Maubeuge road. Outnumbered by the German 1st Army and with the French Fifth Army also falling back, the BEF had no choice but to continue to retire – I Corps retreating to Landrecies and II Corps to Le Cateau. The chaos and confusion were graphically illustrated in Landrecies on 25 August, where a senior officer &quot;apparently took leave of his senses and began firing his revolver down a street&quot;. The Great Retreat continued for two weeks and covered over . The British were closely pursued by the Germans and fought several rearguard actions, including the Battle of Le Cateau on 26 August, the Étreux rearguard action on 27 August and the action at Néry on 1 September. Units disappeared and &quot;More guns were lost than at any time since the American War of Independence.&quot;

Both sides had success at the Battle of Mons: the British had been outnumbered by about managed to withstand the German 1st Army for 48 hours, inflict more casualties on the Germans and then retire in good order. The BEF achieved its main strategic objective, which was to prevent the French Fifth Army from being outflanked. The battle was an important moral victory for the British; as their first battle on the continent since the Crimean War, it was a matter of great uncertainty as to how they would perform. In the event, the British soldiers came away from the battle with a clear sense that they had got the upper hand during the fighting at Mons. The Germans appeared to recognise that they had been dealt a sharp blow by an army they had considered inconsequential. German novelist and infantry officer Walter Bloem wrote:


For the Germans, the Battle of Mons was a tactical repulse and a strategic success. The staff at Kluck&#x27;s headquarters claimed that the two-day battle had failed to envelop the British, due to the subordination of the army to Bülow and the 2nd Army headquarters, which had insisted that the 1st Army keep closer to the western flank, rather than attack to the west of Mons. It was believed that only part of the BEF had been engaged and that there was a main line of defence from Valenciennes to Bavay, which Kluck ordered to be enveloped on 25 August. The 1st Army was delayed by the British and suffered many casualties but crossed the barrier of the Mons–Condé Canal and began its advance into France. The Germans drove the BEF and French armies before them almost to Paris, before being stopped at the Battle of the Marne.

===Casualties===

J. E. Edmonds, the British official historian, recorded &quot;just over&quot; casualties, most in the two battalions of the 8th Brigade which had defended the salient and wrote that German losses &quot;must have been very heavy&quot; as this explained German inertia after dark when the 8th Brigade was vulnerable, several other gaps existed in the British line and the retirement had begun. John Keegan estimated German losses to have been In 1997, D. Lomas recorded German losses from In 2009, Herwig recorded casualties and casualties, despite the fact that Kluck and Kuhl did not reveal 1st Army casualties. Post-war German records estimated dead and missing and 4,932 wounded in the 1st Army from Using German regimental histories, Terence Zuber gave &quot;no more than German casualties.

==Legacy==
The Battle of Mons has attained an almost mythic status. In British historical writing, it has a reputation as an unlikely victory against overwhelming odds, similar to the English victory at the Battle of Agincourt. Mons gained two myths, the first being the a miraculous tale that the Angels of Mons—angelic warriors sometimes described as phantom longbowmen from Agincourt—had saved the British Army by halting the German troops. The second one was the Hound of Mons, which alleged a German scientist engineered a hellhound to be unleashed on British soldiers at night.

Soldiers of the BEF who fought at Mons became eligible for a campaign medal, the 1914 Star, often colloquially called the Mons Star, honouring troops who had fought in Belgium or France On 19 August 1914, Kaiser Wilhelm allegedly issued an Order of the Day which read in part: &quot;. . . my soldiers to exterminate first the treacherous English; walk over Field Marshal French&#x27;s contemptible little Army.&quot; This led to the British &quot;Tommies&quot; of the BEF proudly labelling themselves &quot;The Old Contemptibles&quot;. No evidence of the Order of the Day has been found in German archives and the ex-Kaiser denied giving it. According to the controversial book &quot;Falsehood in War-Time&quot;, an investigation conducted by General Frederick Maurice traced the origins of the Order to the British GHQ, where it had been concocted for propaganda purposes.

The Germans established the St Symphorien Military Cemetery as a memorial to the German and British dead. On a mound in the centre of the cemetery, a grey granite obelisk tall was built with a German inscription: &quot;In memory of the German and English soldiers who fell in the actions near Mons on the 23rd and 24th August 1914.&quot; Originally, and soldiers were interred at the cemetery. More British, Canadian and German graves were moved to the cemetery from other burial grounds and more than were eventually buried in St. Symphorien, of which over unidentified. Special memorials were erected to five soldiers of the Royal Irish Regiment believed to be buried in unnamed graves. Other special memorials record the names of four British soldiers, buried by the Germans in Obourg Churchyard, whose graves could not be found. St. Symphorien cemetery also contains the graves of the two soldiers believed to be the first (Private John Parr, 4th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, 21 August 1914) and the last (Private Gordon Price, 28th Canadian Infantry Regiment, 11 November 1918) Commonwealth soldiers to be killed during the First World War. A tablet in the cemetery sets out the gift of the land by Jean Houzeau de Lehaie. A bronze tablet was erected on a wall of Obourg railway station, commemorating British soldiers who lost their lives around Obourg including an unnamed soldier who is said to have stayed behind at the cost of his own life, perched atop the station, in order to cover his withdrawing comrades. The small portion of the wall supporting the plaque was preserved when the rest of the building was demolished in 1980.

<doc id="630017" wikidata="Q1317359" url="?curid=630017" title="Feynman–Kac formula">
<text>The Feynman–Kac formula, named after Richard Feynman and Mark Kac, establishes a link between parabolic partial differential equations and stochastic processes. In 1947, when Kac and Feynman were both faculty members at Cornell University, Kac attended a presentation of Feynman&#x27;s and remarked that the two of them were working on the same thing from different directions. The Feynman–Kac formula resulted, which proves rigorously the real-valued case of Feynman&#x27;s path integrals. The complex case, which occurs when a particle&#x27;s spin is included, is still an open question.

It offers a method of solving certain partial differential equations by simulating random paths of a stochastic process. Conversely, an important class of expectations of random processes can be computed by deterministic methods.

== Theorem ==
Consider the partial differential equation
formula_1
defined for all formula_2 and formula_3, subject to the terminal condition
formula_4
where formula_5 are known functions, formula_6 is a parameter, and formula_7 is the unknown. Then the Feynman–Kac formula expresses formula_8 as a conditional expectation under the probability measure formula_9

where formula_10 is an Itô process satisfying
formula_11
and formula_12 a Wiener process (also called Brownian motion) under formula_9.

=== Intuitive interpretation ===
Suppose that the position formula_14 of a particle evolves according to the diffusion process
formula_15
Let the particle incur &quot;cost&quot; at a rate of formula_16 at location formula_17 at time formula_18. Let it incur a final cost at formula_19. 

Also, allow the particle to decay. If the particle is at location formula_17 at time formula_18, then it decays with rate formula_22. After the particle has decayed, all future cost is zero.

Then formula_23 is the expected cost-to-go, if the particle starts at formula_24

== Partial proof ==
A proof that the above formula is a solution of the differential equation is long, difficult and not presented here. It is however reasonably straightforward to show that, &quot;if a solution exists&quot;, it must have the above form. The proof of that lesser result is as follows:

Let formula_8 be the solution to the above partial differential equation. Applying the product rule for Itô processes to the process
formula_26
one gets:
formula_27

Since
formula_28 
the third term is formula_29 and can be dropped. We also have that
formula_30

Applying Itô&#x27;s lemma to formula_31, it follows that
formula_32

The first term contains, in parentheses, the above partial differential equation and is therefore zero. What remains is:
formula_33

Integrating this equation from formula_34 to formula_6, one concludes that:
formula_36

Upon taking expectations, conditioned on formula_37, and observing that the right side is an Itô integral, which has expectation zero, it follows that:
formula_38

The desired result is obtained by observing that:
formula_39
and finally
formula_40

== Remarks ==
* The proof above that a solution must have the given form is essentially that of with modifications to account for formula_41.
* The expectation formula above is also valid for &quot;N&quot;-dimensional Itô diffusions. The corresponding partial differential equation for formula_42 becomes: formula_43 where, formula_44 i.e. formula_45, where formula_46 denotes the transpose of formula_47.
* More succinctly, letting formula_48 be the infinitesimal generator of the diffusion process,formula_49
* This expectation can then be approximated using Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo methods.
* When originally published by Kac in 1949, the Feynman–Kac formula was presented as a formula for determining the distribution of certain Wiener functionals. Suppose we wish to find the expected value of the function formula_50 in the case where &quot;x&quot;(τ) is some realization of a diffusion process starting at . The Feynman–Kac formula says that this expectation is equivalent to the integral of a solution to a diffusion equation. Specifically, under the conditions that formula_51, formula_52 where and formula_53
The Feynman–Kac formula can also be interpreted as a method for evaluating functional integrals of a certain form. If
formula_54
where the integral is taken over all random walks, then formula_55 where is a solution to the parabolic partial differential equation formula_56 with initial condition .

== Applications ==

=== Finance ===
In quantitative finance, the Feynman–Kac formula is used to efficiently calculate solutions to the Black–Scholes equation to price options on stocks and zero-coupon bond prices in affine term structure models.

For example, consider a stock price formula_57 undergoing geometric Brownian motion
formula_58
where formula_59 is the risk-free interest rate and formula_60 is the volatility. Equivalently, by Itô&#x27;s lemma,
formula_61
Now consider a European call option on an formula_57 expiring at time formula_6 with strike formula_64. At expiry, it is worth formula_65 Then, the risk-neutral price of the option, at time formula_34 and stock price formula_67, is
formula_68
Plugging into the Feynman–Kac formula, we obtain the Black–Scholes equation:
formula_69
where
formula_70 
More generally, consider an option expiring at time formula_6 with payoff formula_72. The same calculation shows that its price formula_8 satisfies
formula_74
Some other options like the American option do not have a fixed expiry. Some options have value at expiry determined by the past stock prices. For example, an average option has a payoff that is not determined by the underlying price at expiry but by the average underlying price over some predetermined period of time. For these, the Feynman–Kac formula does not directly apply.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
In quantum chemistry, it is used to solve the Schrödinger equation with the pure diffusion Monte Carlo method.

<text>HMS &quot;Vigo&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. She was named after the Battle of Vigo, which took place in 1702 during the War of Spanish Succession between a British-Dutch Fleet and the French, and which ended in a victory for the British. &quot;Vigo&quot; was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Govan. She was launched on 27 September 1945 and commissioned on 9 December 1946.

==Service history==
Upon commissioning, &quot;Vigo&quot; was placed in Reserve along with a number of her sister-ships. In 1949, &quot;Vigo&quot; joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, based in the Mediterranean, which at that time, had quite a large Royal Navy presence. She performed a variety of operations there, at a time when there was much going on in the region and nearby, such as the internal turmoil in Egypt between 1951–1954.

In 1953, while still in the Mediterranean, &quot;Vigo&quot; suffered a fire onboard her, causing minor damage, though &quot;Vigo&quot; would suffer another fire in 1954. Also that year, &quot;Vigo&quot; became the Gunnery Training Ship based at Portsmouth, a duty that a number of her sister ships also performed.

In addition to being the Gunnery Training Ship to HMS &quot;Excellent,&quot; at Whale Island, &quot;Vigo&quot; was also Captain (D) of the Portsmouth Squadron.

As well as her Gunnery duties, during the period 1958–59, &quot;Vigo&quot; also carried out two Icelandic patrols during the first Cod War; took part in NATO exercises, and visited such ports as Vigo, Cuxhaven, Caen and Den Helder, before being paid off in September, 1959, having been relieved as Captain (D) by around 17 August 1959. By this date her hull was considered to be beyond economic repair. Her last commanding officer, Captain Michael Pollock, went on to become an Admiral of the Fleet.

==Disposal==
Following decommissioning in 1959, she was finally scrapped in 1964 at Faslane.

<doc id="630020" wikidata="Q861966" url="?curid=630020" title="Dung beetle">
<text>Dung beetles are beetles that feed on feces. Some species of dung beetles can bury dung 250 times their own mass in one night.

Many dung beetles, known as &quot;rollers&quot;, roll dung into round balls, which are used as a food source or breeding chambers. Other dung beetles like &quot;Euoniticellus intermedius&quot;, known as &quot;tunnelers&quot;, bury the dung wherever they find it. A third group, the &quot;dwellers&quot;, neither roll nor burrow: they simply live in dung. They are often attracted by the feces collected by burrowing owls. There are dung beetle species of various colors and sizes, and some functional traits such as body mass (or biomass) and leg length can have high levels of variability.

All the species belong to the superfamily Scarabaeoidea, most of them to the subfamilies Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae of the family Scarabaeidae (scarab beetles). As most species of Scarabaeinae feed exclusively on feces, that subfamily is often dubbed &quot;true dung beetles&quot;. There are dung-feeding beetles which belong to other families, such as the Geotrupidae (the &quot;earth-boring dung beetle&quot;). The Scarabaeinae alone comprises more than 5,000 species.

The nocturnal African dung beetle &quot;Scarabaeus satyrus&quot; is one of the few known invertebrate animals that navigate and orient themselves using the Milky Way. The daily dung of one elephant can support 2,000,000 beetles.

==Taxonomy==
Dung beetles are not a single taxonomic group; dung feeding is found in a number of families of beetles, so the behaviour cannot be assumed to have evolved only once.
* Coleoptera (order), beetles
** Scarabaeoidea (superfamily), scarabs (most families in the group do not use dung)
*** Geotrupidae (family), &quot;earth-boring dung beetles&quot;
*** Scarabaeidae (family), &quot;scarab beetles&quot; (not all species use dung)
**** Scarabaeinae (subfamily), &quot;true dung beetles&quot;
**** Aphodiinae (subfamily), &quot;small dung beetles&quot; (not all species use dung)

==Ecology and behavior==
Dung beetles live in many habitats, including desert, grasslands and savannas, farmlands, and native and planted forests. They are highly influenced by the environmental context, and do not prefer extremely cold or dry weather. They are found on all continents except Antarctica. They eat the dung of herbivores and omnivores, and prefer that produced by the latter. Many of them also feed on mushrooms and decaying leaves and fruits. The Neotropical &quot;Deltochilum valgum&quot;, &quot;D. kolbei&quot; and &quot;D. viridescens&quot; are carnivores with a strong preference for preying upon millipedes. Two other species from Brazil, &quot;Canthon dives&quot; and &quot;Canthon virens&quot;, prey on queens and other winged forms of leafcutter ants. One species from the Iberian Peninsula, &quot;Thorectes lusitanicus,&quot; feeds on acorns. Dung beetles do not necessarily have to eat or drink anything else, because the dung provides all the necessary nutrients.

Most dung beetles search for dung using their sensitive sense of smell. Some smaller species simply attach themselves to the dung-providers to wait for the dung. After capturing the dung, a dung beetle rolls it, following a straight line despite all obstacles. Sometimes, dung beetles try to steal the dung ball from another beetle, so the dung beetles have to move rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen. Dung beetles can roll up to 10 times their weight. Male &quot;Onthophagus taurus&quot; beetles can pull 1,141 times their own body weight: the equivalent of an average person pulling six double-decker buses full of people.

A species of dung beetle (the African &quot;Scarabaeus zambesianus&quot;) navigates by polarization patterns in moonlight, the first animal known to do so. Dung beetles can also navigate when only the Milky Way or clusters of bright stars are visible, making them the only insects known to orient themselves by the Milky Way. Research using 1 kg bolus of elephant dung found that a larger number exploit it during the night (13,700) than during the day (3,330). The eyes of dung beetles are superposition compound eyes typical of many scarabaeid beetles;
The sequence of images shows a sequence of the beetle rolling a dung ball. It does this to navigate.

Cambefort and Hanski (1991) classified dung beetles into three functional types based on their feeding and nesting strategies such as – Rollers, Tunnelers and Dwellers. The &quot;rollers&quot; roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or for making a brooding ball. In the latter case, two beetles, one male and one female, stay around the dung ball during the rolling process. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, while the female hitch-hikes or simply follows behind. In some cases, the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the ball, then mate underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of mass provisioning.

Some species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring. The dung beetle goes through a complete metamorphosis. The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents. During the larval stage, the beetle feeds on the dung surrounding it.

The behavior of the beetles was poorly understood until the studies of Jean Henri Fabre in the late 19th century. For example, Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles. By observation and experiment, he found the seeming helpers were in fact awaiting an opportunity to steal the roller&#x27;s food source.

They are widely used in ecological research as a good bioindicator group to examine the impacts of climate disturbances, such as extreme droughts and associated fires, and human activities on tropical biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, such as seed dispersal, soil bioturbation and nutrient cycling.
==Benefits and uses==

Dung beetles play a role in agriculture and tropical forests. By burying and consuming dung, they improve nutrient recycling and soil structure. Dung beetles have been further shown to improve soil conditions and plant growth on rehabilitated coal mines in South Africa. They are also important for the dispersal of seeds present in animals&#x27; dung, influencing seed burial and seedling recruitment in tropical forests. They can protect livestock, such as cattle, by removing the dung which, if left, could provide habitat for pests such as flies. Therefore, many countries have introduced the creatures for the benefit of animal husbandry. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.

In Australia, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) commissioned the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985) which, led by George Bornemissza, sought to introduce species of dung beetles from South Africa and Europe. The successful introduction of 23 species was made, most notably &quot;Digitonthophagus gazella&quot; and &quot;Euoniticellus intermedius&quot;, which has resulted in improvement of the quality and fertility of Australian cattle pastures, along with a reduction in the population of pestilent Australian bush flies by around 90%. In 1995 it was reported that dung beetles were being trialled in the Sydney beach suburb of Curl Curl to deal with dog droppings.

An application made by Landcare Research to import up to 11 species of dung beetle into New Zealand was approved in 2011. As well as improving pasture soils the Dung Beetle Release Strategy Group said that it would result in a reduction in emissions of nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas) from agriculture. There was, however, strong opposition from some at the University of Auckland, and a few others, based on the risks of the dung beetles acting as vectors of disease. There were public health researchers at the University of Auckland who agreed with the Environmenal Protection Authority&#x27;s risk assessment. Several Landcare programmes in Australia involved schoolchildren collecting dung beetles.

The African dung beetle (&quot;D. gazella&quot;) was introduced in several locations in North and South America and has been spreading its distribution to other regions by natural dispersal and accidental transportation, and is now probably naturalized in most countries between Mexico and Argentina. The exotic species might be useful for controlling diseases of livestock in commercial areas, and might displace native species in modified landscapes; however, data is not conclusive about its effect on native species in natural environments and further monitoring is required.

The Mediterranean dung beetle (&quot;Bubas bison&quot;) has been used in conjunction with biochar stock fodder to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, which are both greenhouse gases. The beetles work the biochar-enriched dung into the soil without the use of machines.

Scientists in Canberra in 1965 discovered that Dung beetles (Scarabaeids), specifically &quot;Onthophagus australis&quot; Guérin-Méneville, improve plant yields using their dung. Japanese millet was studied and data on nutrient uptake. These plants were placed in pots lacking nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Cow-dung was then added in treatment groups with or without &quot;O. australis.&quot; Some treatment groups even had two out of the three nutrients supplemented in the pots. Comparisons of the treatment and control groups were made to show that top growth and roots significantly increased when the dung was mixed well into the soil in the pots. Results showed that dung beetle activity greatly improved plant life. The dung has little impact alone, but in combination with the dung beetle, the nutritional value for the plants increases greatly. This suggests that dung beetles have many positive implications for the environment, including a beneficial role with plant life.

==In culture==
Some dung beetles are used as food in South East Asia and a variety of dung beetle species have been used therapeutically (and are still being used in traditionally living societies) in potions and folk medicines to treat a number of illnesses and disorders.

In Isan, Northeastern Thailand, the local people eat many different kinds of insects, including the dung beetle. There is an Isan song กุดจี่หายไปใหน &quot;Where Did the Dung Beetle Go&quot;, which relates the replacement of water buffalo with the &quot;metal&quot; buffalo, which does not provide the dung needed for the dung beetle and has led to the increasing rarity of the dung beetle in the agricultural region. 

===Ancient Egypt===

Several species of the dung beetle, most notably the species &quot;Scarabaeus sacer&quot; (often referred to as &quot;the sacred scarab&quot;), enjoyed a sacred status among the ancient Egyptians.
Egyptian hieroglyphic script uses the image of the beetle to represent a triliteral phonetic that Egyptologists transliterate as &quot;xpr&quot; or &quot;ḫpr&quot; and translate as &quot;to come into being&quot;, &quot;to become&quot; or &quot;to transform&quot;. The derivative term &quot;xprw&quot; or &quot;ḫpr(w)&quot; is variously translated as &quot;form&quot;, &quot;transformation&quot;, &quot;happening&quot;, &quot;mode of being&quot; or &quot;what has come into being&quot;, depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.

The scarab was linked to Khepri (&quot;he who has come into being&quot;), the god of the rising sun. The ancients believed that the dung beetle was only male-sexed, and reproduced by depositing semen into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who creates himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. Plutarch wrote: 

The ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some New Kingdom royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of Ramses VI portrays the nightly &quot;death&quot; and &quot;rebirth&quot; of the sun as being swallowed by Nut, goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.

The image of the scarab, conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, and resurrection, is ubiquitous in ancient Egyptian religious and funerary art.

Excavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, ivory, stone, Egyptian faience, and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or cartouche. Some have been used as seals. Pharaohs sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the commemorative scarab of Queen Tiye. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at Luxor Temple, at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see Serapis) and elsewhere in Egypt.

The scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such &quot;heart scarabs&quot; is the yellow-green pectoral scarab found among the entombed provisions of Tutankhamen. It was carved from a large piece of Libyan desert glass. The purpose of the &quot;heart scarab&quot; was to ensure that the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the &quot;transformation spells&quot; of the &quot;Coffin Texts&quot;, which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (&quot;xpr&quot;) into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.

One scholar comments on other traits of the scarab connected with the theme of death and rebirth:
In contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt&#x27;s neighbors adopted the scarab motif for seals of varying types. The best-known of these being Judean LMLK seals (8 of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of Hezekiah.

The scarab remains an item of popular interest thanks to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue &quot;for luck&quot;.

===In literature===
In Aesop&#x27;s fable &quot;The Eagle and the Beetle&quot;, the eagle kills a hare that has asked for sanctuary with a beetle. The beetle then takes revenge by twice destroying the eagle&#x27;s eggs. The eagle, in despair, flies up to Olympus and places her latest eggs in Zeus&#x27;s lap, beseeching the god to protect them. When the beetle finds out what the eagle has done, it stuffs itself with dung, goes straight up to Zeus and flies right into his face. Zeus is startled at the sight of the unpleasant creature, jumping to his feet so that the eggs are broken. Learning of the origin of their feud, Zeus attempts to mediate and, when his efforts to mediate fail, he changes the breeding season of the eagle to a time when the beetles are not above ground.

Aristophanes alluded to Aesop&#x27;s fable several times in his plays. In &quot;Peace&quot;, the hero rides up to Olympus to free the goddess Peace from her prison. His steed is an enormous dung beetle which has been fed so much dung that it has grown to monstrous size.

Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Dung Beetle&quot; tells the story of a dung beetle who lives in the stable of the king&#x27;s horses in an imaginary kingdom. When he demands golden shoes like those the king&#x27;s horse wears and is refused, he flies away and has a series of adventures, which are often precipitated by his feeling of superiority to other animals. He finally returns to the stable having decided (against all logic) that it is for him that the king&#x27;s horse wears golden shoes.

In Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, the transformed character of Gregor Samsa is called an &quot;old dung beetle&quot; (&quot;alter Mistkäfer&quot;) by a charwoman.

<text>In mathematics, abstract nonsense, general abstract nonsense, generalized abstract nonsense, and general nonsense are nonderogatory terms used by mathematicians to describe long, theoretical parts of a proof they skip over when readers are expected to be familiar with them. These terms are mainly used for abstract methods related to category theory and homological algebra. More generally, &quot;abstract nonsense&quot; may refer to a proof that relies on category-theoretic methods, or even to the study of category theory itself.

==Background==

Roughly speaking, category theory is the study of the general form, that is, categories of mathematical theories, without regard to their content. As a result, mathematical proofs that rely on category-theoretic ideas often seem out-of-context, somewhat akin to a non sequitur. Authors sometimes dub these proofs &quot;abstract nonsense&quot; as a light-hearted way of alerting readers to their abstract nature. Labeling an argument &quot;abstract nonsense&quot; is usually &quot;not&quot; intended to be derogatory, and is instead used jokingly, in a self-deprecating way, affectionately, or even as a compliment to the generality of the argument. Alexander Grothendieck was critical of this notion, and stated that:
Certain ideas and constructions in mathematics share a uniformity throughout many domains, unified by category theory. Typical methods include the use of classifying spaces and universal properties, use of the Yoneda lemma, natural transformations between functors, and diagram chasing.

When an audience can be assumed to be familiar with the general form of such arguments, mathematicians will use the expression &quot;Such and such is true by abstract nonsense&quot; rather than provide an elaborate explanation of particulars. For example, one might say that &quot;By abstract nonsense, products are unique up to isomorphism when they exist&quot;, instead of arguing about how these isomorphisms can be derived from the universal property that defines the product. This allows one to skip proof details that can be considered trivial or not providing much insight, focusing instead on genuinely innovative parts of a larger proof.

==History==

The term predates the foundation of category theory as a subject itself. Referring to a joint paper with Samuel Eilenberg that introduced the notion of a &quot;category&quot; in 1942, Saunders Mac Lane wrote the subject was &#x27;then called &quot;general abstract nonsense&quot;&#x27;. The term is often used to describe the application of category theory and its techniques to less abstract domains.

The term is believed to have been coined by the mathematician Norman Steenrod, himself one of the developers of the categorical point of view.

<doc id="630024" wikidata="Q6953594" url="?curid=630024" title="NESticle">
<text>NESticle is a Nintendo Entertainment System emulator, which was written by Icer Addis of Bloodlust Software. Released on April 3, 1997, the widely popular program originally ran under MS-DOS and Windows 95. It was the first freeware NES emulator, and became commonly considered the NES emulator of choice for the 1990s. Initially offering few features and only supporting a handful of games, development proceeded rapidly and to expand usability such that NESticle is today credited with introducing the concept of recordable playthrough for emulation, as well as providing the capacity for users to create their own graphical hacks via an integrated graphics editor. In pioneering this heightened level of access for users, and providing the tools for fans to hack and remix familiar classics, NESticle has been credited by &quot;Spin&quot; as representing a milestone toward the development of video game music as a genre.

While the emulator is no longer updated and has become obsolete as other emulation projects have developed and improved, NESticle remains frequently listed among prominent top tier emulators and it is still regarded as a good choice for emulation on older (486 and earlier) computers.

In January 2022, the source code for a Super NES version of the emulator, SNESticle, was released by Addis after a programmer attempted to reverse-engineer the code, which had been released in a GameCube game, Fight Night Round 2. In February of that same year, Addis began work on a follow-up to NESticle, an experimental macOS-based application based on transistor-level simulation of the NES chipset, called metalnes.

== Development ==
NESticle offered its initial release as NESticle v0.2 on April 3, 1997. Its name is a portmanteau of &quot;NES&quot; (the console it emulates) and &quot;testicle&quot;. The program originally ran under DOS and Windows 95, offering few features and only supporting a handful of games. It was one of the first freeware NES emulators, and soon became more popular than shareware rivals such as iNES.

NESticle was coded in C++ and assembly using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.10. Part of the emulator&#x27;s appeal was performance: its system requirements capped at around 25MHz enabling it to run on modest Pentium and 486 DX2 PCs. Its GUI was colorful and easy to use, featuring numerous utilities that allowed user to view, edit, and save custom graphics, palettes, and the like. Within two months of its April release, NESticle could take screenshots mid-game, pause and resume progress at any point using save states, edit in-game palettes and graphics, play games online, save audio output, and record and playback gameplay movies. NESticle, as its name implied, also had a dash of lowbrow and morbid humor. The mouse pointer, for instance, was skinned with a bloody, dismembered left hand extending its pointer finger.

The source code for NESticle was illegally copied from Addis&#x27;s computer by a code cracker who accessed its network shares with Samba. Because of the incident, Addis decided to discontinue NESticle. August 1998 saw the final NESticle release, version x.xx, and support for the emulator was discontinued. This version featured noticeably improved emulation, especially audio emulation (the triangle wave was correctly 4-bit quantized, the 50% pulse wave had the correct duty cycle and the noise was corrected). It was also DOS only.
NESticle eventually became obsolete as other emulation projects continued to develop and improve. In particular, NESticle has been criticized within modern emulation circles for an overwhelmingly aesthetics-based philosophy making heavy reliance on emulation quirks which resulted in game images that would only work on this emulator specifically. Nevertheless, it continues to be noted years after its obsolescence for its speed, particularly on lower-end computers.

== Influence ==
As one of the more popular early emulators, NESticle&#x27;s influence on the emulation scene has been far-reaching. Its innovative development of &#x27;NES movie&#x27; playthrough recording, and its use as a tool for homebrew graphical hacks enabled it to influence the development of even tangentially related fields such as the video game music genre, and console case modding. The emulator has been noted as an influence in the gaming backgrounds of video game collectors like Pat Contri (known as &quot;Pat the NES Punk&quot;), Destructoid&#x27;s Samit Sarkar, and indie video game musicians, The NESkimos.

<text>USS &quot;Admirable&quot; (AM-136) was the lead ship of her class of minesweeper built for the United States Navy during World War II. In commission from 1943 to 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Navy in 1945 and served as T-331 until stricken in 1958.

==Construction and commissioning==
Originally classified as a &quot;coastal minesweeper,&quot; AMc-113, &quot;Admirable&quot; was reclassified as a minesweeper, AM-136, on 21 February 1942. She was laid down on 8 April 1942 at Tampa, Florida, by the Tampa Shipbuilding Company. She was launched on 18 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Ann Pillsbury Fehr, daughter of Commander Horace W. Pillsbury, and commissioned on 20 April 1943.

==Service history==

===U.S. Navy, World War II, 1943–1945===
&quot;Admirable&quot; departed Tampa on 23 April 1943 and conducted a shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Mexico before heading for Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 23 June 1943. &quot;Admirable&quot; operated out of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia, for five months of training in antisubmarine warfare, minelaying, and mine sweeping techniques. After upkeep and fitting-out, she departed Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 November 1943 in company with the internal combustion engine repair ship for duty in the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal on 8 December 1943, &quot;Admirable&quot; continued on to San Diego, California, where she moored on 18 December 1943. In January 1944, following tests at the West Coast Sound School, she received orders to proceed independently to Adak, Territory of Alaska. During the voyage, she encountered heavy seas which damaged her sonar gear. Following her arrival in Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, on 6 February 1944, she was drydocked for repairs.

On 13 February 1944, &quot;Admirable&quot; was assigned to Task Group 91.2 (TG 91.2). She operated from Adak, escorting merchant and troopships to such ports in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands as Kodiak, Dutch Harbor, Amchitka, Kiska, Cold Bay, and Attu Island. On four occasions during her 18-month tour in the Aleutians, &quot;Admirable&quot; went alongside the destroyer tender at Adak briefly to repair damage caused by the cold weather, heavy seas, and violent, gusting winds known as &quot;williwaws&quot;.

In July 1944, &quot;Admirable&quot; began to clear the minefield in Chiniak Bay off Kodiak Island. She was the lead ship of a group, composed of the minesweepers , , and , and the auxiliary motor minesweeper , which, on 2 August 1944, began a sweep of the channel to St. Paul&#x27;s Harbor. The minesweepers then established patrols outside the harbor to await the arrival of President Franklin D. Roosevelt aboard the heavy cruiser . Roosevelt had left San Diego on 14 July, steamed to Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, to meet with General Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz to discuss plans for the invasion of the Philippines, and stopped at Kodiak on 7 August 1944. &quot;Baltimore&quot; pulled out of St. Paul″s Harbor the same day, and Roosevelt continued his journey back to the United States aboard the destroyer . &quot;Admirable&quot; then resumed escort duty and continued that work into March 1945.

On 14 March 1945, &quot;Admirable&quot;″s commanding officer was designated officer in tactical command of eight ships and all aircraft participating in a combined air-surface attack on a fictitious submarine in Kuluk Bay. The minesweeper then returned to her escort duties.

Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula, a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the Pacific War, &quot;Admirable&quot; proceeded to Dutch Harbor in May 1945 for repairs preparatory to her transfer. Because of the continual beating of the heavy seas, of the forward end of each of her bilge keels as well as her sonar gear were replaced. With her repairs complete, she then steamed to Cold Bay, where Soviet Navy Rear Admiral Boris Dmitrievich Popov, the Soviet commanding officer at Cold Bay under Project Hula, inspected &quot;Admirable&quot; on 30 May 1945 and accepted her for transfer to the Soviet Union. On 18 June 1945, a Soviet crew reported on board to train for one month in gunnery, engineering, and mine sweeping procedures.

===Soviet Navy, 1945–1958===
Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, &quot;Admirable&quot; was decommissioned on 19 July 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a &quot;&quot; (&quot;mine sweeper&quot;) and renamed T-331 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East.

In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively &quot;returned&quot; to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery. The Soviet Union never returned &quot;Admirable&quot; to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a &quot;fleet minesweeper&quot; (MSF) and renamed her MSF-136 on 7 February 1955.

==Disposal==
&quot;T-331&quot; was stricken in 1958 and apparently was sold for scrap in the Soviet Union. Unaware of this, the U.S. Navy retained &quot;Admirable&quot; on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her name on 1 January 1983.

<text>The &quot;Admirable&quot; class was one of the largest and most successful classes of minesweepers ordered by the United States Navy during World War II. Typically, minesweepers detected and removed naval mines before the rest of the fleet arrived, thereby ensuring safe passage for the larger ships. They were also charged with anti-submarine warfare (ASW) duties with rear-mounted depth charge racks and a forward-firing Hedgehog antisubmarine mortar. Their job was essential to the safety and success of U.S. naval operations during World War II and the Korean War. These minesweepers were also employed as patrol vessel and convoy escorts. The only remaining ship of this class is located at Freedom Park, Omaha, NE.

The of patrol craft escorts was based on the &quot;Admirable&quot;-class design.

==Service in other Navies==

As a part of Project Hula – a secret 1945 program that transferred 149 U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Territory of Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan – the U.S. Navy transferred 24 &quot;Admirable&quot;-class minesweepers to the Soviet Navy between May and August 1945. At least some of them saw action in the Soviet offensive against Japanese forces in Northeast Asia in August 1945. The Soviet Union never returned them to the United States.

After World War II, the United States transferred &quot;Admirable&quot;-class minesweepers to the Republic of China Navy, the Republic of China″s Chinese Maritime Customs Service, the Republic of Korea Navy, the Republic of Vietnam Navy, and the Dominican, Mexican, Myanmar, and Philippine navies.

<doc id="630037" wikidata="Q471307" url="?curid=630037" title="Karl-August Fagerholm">
<text>Karl-August Fagerholm (31 December 1901, in Siuntio – 22 May 1984, in Helsinki) was a Finnish politician. Fagerholm served as Speaker of Parliament and three times Prime Minister of Finland (1948–50, 1956–57, and 1958–59). Fagerholm became one of the leading politicians of the Social Democrats after the armistice in the Continuation War. As a Scandinavia-oriented Swedish-speaking Finn, he was believed to be more to the taste of the Soviet Union&#x27;s leadership than his predecessor, Väinö Tanner. Fagerholm&#x27;s postwar career was, however, marked by fierce opposition from both the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Finland. He narrowly lost the presidential election to Urho Kekkonen in 1956.

==Early life==
Fagerholm was born in Siuntio as the youngest child of stonecutter Johan August Fagerholm and Olga Serafina Worbs (née Nordman). The elder Fagerholm died of tuberculosis in June 1901, six months before the birth of his youngest son. Fagerholm had in his youth worked as a paperboy for Hufvudstadsbladet and later as a barber, and was also briefly chairman (1920–1923) of the Barbers&#x27; Union. In 1930, he was elected member of Finland&#x27;s Parliament. In the 1920s and the 1930s, the main challenge for the Social Democrats was the rehabilitation after the Finnish Civil War, in which the Social Democrats had belonged to the defeated side. A revival of anti-socialist opinion had in Finland like in many countries in Continental Europe led to a right-wing shift in public opinion and the emerge of the semi-fascist Lapua Movement. One consequence was that socialists were barred from the Cabinet 1929 to 1937. Principles of parliamentarism again were finally heeded in 1937, when Fagerholm became Minister for Social Affairs in a series of Cabinets from 1937 to 1943.

In government, Fagerholm was one of the chief executors of the neutralist Scandinavia-orientation, which had increasingly been seen by Conservatives and Socialists in the 1930s to be Finland&#x27;s deliverance from the danger of Soviet expansionism. That danger seemed to have increased with fierce Soviet anticapitalist sentiments being met with equally fierce anticommunist sentiments in Finland. As a native Swedish speaker, Social Democrat, former Union leader, and head of the Ministry for Social Affairs, he was just cut out for that task, but the time that he had was too short.

==Winter War and the Continuation War==
When the Winter War broke out, suspicions against Finland&#x27;s &quot;hazardous foreign politics&quot; remained strong, most importantly among leading Social Democrats in Sweden. As the Winter War ended with the loss of Finnish Karelia, that was generally seen as the failure of the neutralist Scandinavia-orientation. As the Soviet Union&#x27;s disapproval ended the discussions on a Swedish-Finnish defence co-operation in 1940, the Scandinavist line had run into a blind alley; and Fagerholm had no more say in the policy discussions that ultimately led to close dependency of Nazi Germany, German troops on Finnish soil, revanchism and to co-belligerence in the Continuation War.

During the Continuation War, controversies on 68,000 refugees&#x27; internment in labour camps in the vicinity of German troops, particularly on the Anthonio scandal in which eight Jewish refugees were deported to the Gestapo on 6 November 1942, prompted Fagerholm to raise the question of his resignation. After the Battle of Stalingrad, when it increasingly became obvious that Nazi Germany was about to be defeated in World War II, the Cabinet of Edwin Linkomies was appointed to seek peace with the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Fagerholm was not included.

The end of hostilities in September 1944 found Finland in a thoroughly weakened state economically. In addition to its human and physical losses, Finland had to deal with more than 400,000 evacuees from the territories once again lost to the Soviet Union. War reparations were another burden for Finland. The reparations paid from 1944 to 1952 amounted to an annual average of more than 2% of Finland&#x27;s gross national product. The reparations were delivered according to a strict schedule, with penalties for late shipments. By inciting strikes and other disturbances at moments critical for scheduled delivers, the Soviet Union tried to strengthen the influence of the domestic Communists and to exert direct pressure on the government.

==Postwar years==
Fagerholm was elected chairman of Finland&#x27;s Social Democrats. Väinö Tanner had to resign since he was seen with the uttermost suspicion by Finnish Communists by many Social Democrats, by the leadership in Sweden and, most importantly, by the Soviet Union. For the third time, like in 1920 and 1930, Fagerholm&#x27;s main task was to rehabilitate and consolidate the Social Democrats. This time, however, the accusations came from the left. Fagerholm appeared to be the least enthusiastic of the leading advocates for the Continuation War and so could be elected as sort of a compromise candidate, accepted by both the Tanner-supporting majority and by the critics of the war, sympatisants of the Six and the so-called &quot;peace opposition&quot; concentrated in the Swedophone part of the Labor Union and Social Democracy.

The Soviet victory in World War II had greatly improved the prestige of their supporters in Finland. When, in 1946, the Communist-allied Mauno Pekkala finally won an election and became the prime minister of a coalition cabinet that included also the Social Democrats, Fagerholm could concentrate on his role as party chairman and remained outside the cabinet. It was Fagerholm&#x27;s conviction that Communists could not be defeated with repressive methods that had been tried since the Civil War. Communism was to be countered in free debate and free elections. The battle of the late 1940s was that in the trade unions in which boards and representatives were elected proportionally. The Social Democrats succeeded more often than not to fend off or reverse Communist takeovers.

==1948 elections and Fagerholm as PM==

When new parliament elections were held in July 1948, the Communists suffered a sharp drop in support, falling from 51 to 38 seats. Communists had demanded the posts of prime minister and either ministry for foreign affairs or internal affairs and so were not included in the new minority cabinet, led by Fagerholm. (There was no communist participation in Finland&#x27;s government again until 1966. Fagerholm&#x27;s minority government relied mostly on support by deputies of the National Coalition Party and Liberal parties plus the conservative wing of the Agrarian League. In social policy, Fagerholm&#x27;s government was notable for passing a public pension law.

As leader of the Social Democrats, he was prime minister from 1948 to 1950 despite fierce Communist opposition and accusations by the Soviet Union that he intended to undermine the Finnish-Soviet Treaty by taking Finland into NATO. Even Finland&#x27;s growing integration into the world economy, as demonstrated by its joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1949, was viewed with similar suspicion although it served Soviet interests since it contributed to Finland&#x27;s ability to meet the harsh war reparations requirements of the Paris Peace Treaty.

Opposition from the domestic Communists, under Soviet guidance, exemplified by communist strike agitators who in 1949 tried to take over the dockworker&#x27;s union and indirectly threatened the stability of the government of Karl-August Fagerholm.

==1950s==
The war and the post-war times of economic hardship had motivated government control of prices and wages attempting to hamper inflation. One of the themes in the elections and one of the important objectives for Fagerholm&#x27;s government was to transfer the handling of incomes policy to negotiations between the unions and the employers&#x27; organizations. In January 1950, the Parliament agreed to increase wages and to end wage controls.

Soon afterward, a minority cabinet under Kekkonen assumed power. Wage negotiations ended in an impasse in the spring. A warning of general strike was issued to speed up the negotiations. In the tense situation, Fagerholm, now Speaker of Parliament, brokered a solution that was supported in ballot by a clear majority of trade union members.

Fagerholm&#x27;s relation to the aged president of Finland, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, remained controversial, but the release of the latter&#x27;s diary has thrown some light on the issue. Supporters of Fagerholm argue that his line in foreign politics was considerably closer to that of Paasikivi, but Fagerholm, in many aspects, was ideologically remote from the Conservative fennoman Paasikivi. Supporters of Kekkonen argue that Fagerholm&#x27;s contact with the US embassy and pecuniary support from the US could not have been approved by Paasikivi. Although Paasikivi considered both contenders for the position as prime minister as skilful and politically capable, he actually came down more often in favor of Kekkonen, who enjoyed the support of the Soviet leadership.

In the 1956 Finnish presidential election Fagerholm would have won if two electors had voted otherwise; he got 149 votes to Urho Kekkonen&#x27;s 151. Fagerholm instead succeeded Kekkonen as prime minister for a four-party coalition cabinet.

==Third term as Prime Minister==

During his second term as prime minister, in 1956 to 1957, he visited the Soviet Union, and relations appeared to have improved. After a period out of office, the general elections of July 1958 again brought a Fagerholm-led coalition cabinet to office. Their chief opponents were the Communists, who had become the largest party in Parliament. Kekkonen did nothing to mitigate a Kremlin fear that Finland would abandon the careful course steered by Paasikivi and Kekkonen since the late 1940s that sought to ensure that Finland would do nothing that conflicted with the interests of the Soviet Union.

Finnish membership in the Nordic Council in 1955 and a progressive increase in trade with the Western world were seen in Moscow as harbingers of the loss of Finland to the West, particularly under a politician like Fagerholm known for Nordic sympathies and US connections. Therefore, in 1958, the Soviet government pursued an escalating policy of economic and other sanctions against the Fagerholm government, canceling discussions on a range of economic issues and trying to leave little doubt in the minds of Finns that having Fagerholm as prime minister would be exceedingly costly. Finally, on 21 October 1958, Soviet Ambassador Viktor Lebedev was suddenly recalled from Finland.

Immediately afterwards, there was a new crisis over the memoirs of Yrjö Leino, who had been Finland&#x27;s Communist Minister of the Interior in the crucial period from 1945 to 1948 period and had been living in retirement ever since. The Soviets were highly displeased with Leino&#x27;s writing his memoirs, and the Soviet Chrgé d&#x27;Affaires Ivan Filippov demanded for Fagerholm&#x27;s government to prevent their publication. Fagerholm said that the government could legally do nothing since the work had not yet been released and that there was no censorship in Finland. Filippov advised that if Leino&#x27;s book was published, the Soviet Union would draw &quot;serious conclusions&quot;. Later the same, day Fagerholm called Untamo Utrio of the Tammi publishing house and convinced him to cancel the January launch of the book. (Eventually, the entire print run of the book was destroyed, but that was long after the end of Fagerholm&#x27;s term.) Deputy director of Tammi Jarl Hellemann later argued that the fuss about the book was completely disproportionate to its substance, describing the incident as the first instance of Finnish self-censorship motivated by concerns about relations to the Soviet Union.

That concession, however, was not enough to remove the Soviet pressure on Fagerholm. On 4 December 1958, Fagerholm filed his resignation. In January 1959, after Kekkonen had traveled to Leningrad to personally assure Nikita Khrushchev that Finland would be a &quot;good neighbor&quot; and a prime minister from Kekkonen&#x27;s Agrarian Party was appointed, all economic intercourse resumed.

==Personal life==
Fagerholm married Judith Jormala in 1905, and had three children: Brita (1927–2013), Stina (b. 1929) and Einar (b. 1935). His granddaughters Jannica (b. 1961) and Catarina (b. 1963) are well known in Finland as economists.

<doc id="630039" wikidata="Q5913350" url="?curid=630039" title="Hour Glass (band)">
<text>Hour Glass was an American soul band based in Los Angeles, California in 1967 and 1968. Among their members were two future members of the Allman Brothers Band (Duane Allman and his brother Gregg) and three future studio musicians at the FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama (Pete Carr, Johnny Sandlin and Paul Hornsby).

==History==
Formed by members of two disbanded rival groups that had played the same southern circuit, The Allman Joys (based in Florida) and the Men-its (based in Alabama), the group was booked in early 1967 into a month-long engagement in St. Louis, Missouri, where they met members of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, whose manager, Bill McEuen, arranged for them a contract with Liberty Records.

Moving to Los Angeles, they were soon opening for groups like The Doors and Buffalo Springfield and recording their eponymous debut album, full of lighthearted poppy soul that was unlike what the group was performing in clubs and theatres in California such as The Fillmore Ballrooom and Troubadour. These songs were chosen from a pool of staff writers, including Jackson Browne and Jimmy Radcliffe, whose song &quot;Nothing But Tears&quot; was the A-side of the Hour Glass&#x27; debut single. The ensuing album flopped, perhaps in part because the material did not really reflect the group&#x27;s tastes or strengths. In fact, the Hour Glass generally refused to perform these songs in their live shows, focusing instead on their gritty, blues- and R&amp;B-inflected southern sounds, along with a couple of originals by Gregg Allman.

The group members were unhappy at not being able to perform as often as they had been accustomed due to the label&#x27;s concern with overexposure. Losing bassist Mabron McKinney and his successor Bob Keller, they soldiered on, performing concerts and recording a second album, &quot;Power of Love&quot;, which featured bassist Pete Carr from Daytona Beach. However, &quot;Power of Love&quot;, which also featured the songwriting skills of Gregg Allman and material that fit the group much better than the material on their debut, nonetheless flopped.

In a last-ditch effort, the members left Los Angeles to work at the FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where they recorded a handful of tracks that showed their full potential in the studio. After these tracks were rejected by Liberty, the group returned to the Southeast, did a few more gigs, and called it quits.

Duane and Gregg Allman went to Jacksonville, Florida, where they jammed with folk-rockers The 31st of February, featuring drummer Butch Trucks. The others went back to Alabama and did some session work in Muscle Shoals.

After the 31st of February demos were rejected by that group&#x27;s label, Gregg Allman decided to return to Los Angeles to pick up the pieces of the Hour Glass&#x27; deal with Liberty. He recorded several tracks in Los Angeles with studio musicians. A single, a remake of Tammy Wynette&#x27;s country hit &quot;D.I.V.O.R.C.E.,&quot; was released on Liberty under the name &quot;Gregg Allman and the Hour Glass.&quot; However, it too failed to chart, and the remaining tracks for a planned album were scuttled and only issued twenty-five years later as bonus tracks on reissues of the Hour Glass&#x27;s Liberty recordings.

Duane Allman re-joined his former Hour Glass bandmates in Muscle Shoals, where he met drummer J. Johanny &quot;Jaimoe&quot; Johanson. Interested in recruiting bassist Berry Oakley of Jacksonville psychedelic blues band the Second Coming, whom he had met the previous July at an Hour Glass performance at Jacksonville&#x27;s Comic Book Club, Allman and Johanson left Muscle Shoals for Florida, where Allman began sitting in with Oakley&#x27;s band. Impressed with Second Coming guitarist Dickey Betts&#x27; playing, Allman decided to add him to his fledgling line-up as well. With the addition of a second drummer, former 31 February drummer Butch Trucks, and brother Gregg on vocals and organ, who would at this point abandon his solo career in Los Angeles, the new line-up became the Allman Brothers Band.

<text>Abbotsford is a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 2004.

==Demographics==
The riding has the lowest proportion of Catholics in Canada, with just 10.6% of the population adhering to Catholicism., as well as the highest proportion (9.8%) of &quot;Christian, not included elsewhere&quot; (non-Protestant, non-Catholic, non-Orthodox). 12.2% of its population claim Dutch ethnic origin, the highest such figure for any Canadian federal riding.

==Geography==
As of the 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution, the district includes the southeastern portion of the City of Abbotsford and the Upper Sumas 6 Indian reserve.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 2003. 56.1% of the riding was taken from Fraser Valley riding, and 43.9% from Langley—Abbotsford.

The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Abbotsford should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined Abbotsford loses portions of its current territory in the north and west to the new districts of Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon and Langley—Aldergrove. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015.

The 2015 Canadian general election marked the first time a Conservative candidate was elected in Abbotsford with less than 50% of the popular vote.

Under the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution the riding will be replaced by Abbotsford—South Langley.

===Historical boundaries===

==Members of Parliament==

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:





===Current member of Parliament===
Abbotsford&#x27;s MP is Ed Fast. He is a member of the Conservative Party of Canada and was first elected in the 2006 election. He is a former Abbotsford city councillor and has worked as a lawyer, having earned a law degree at University of British Columbia. During the 40th Parliament, since January 2009, he was the chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and a member of the Liaison Committee.

Lavash is one of the most widespread types of bread in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey. The traditional recipe can be adapted to the modern kitchen by using a griddle or wok instead of the &quot;tonir&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Lavash, the preparation, meaning and appearance of traditional bread as an expression of culture in Armenia&quot; was inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. In 2016, making and sharing flatbread (lavash, katyrma, jupka or yufka) in communities of Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey was inscribed on the list as well. Lavash is similar to &quot;yufka&quot;, but in Turkish cuisine lavash (&quot;lavaş&quot;) is prepared with a yeast dough while &quot;yufka&quot; is typically unleavened.

==Etymology==
Hrach Martirosyan tentatively connects Armenian with dialectal , , &#x27;palm, flat of the hand&#x27;, , &#x27;flat, polished stone for playing&#x27;, &#x27;very thin&#x27; and assumes derivation from Proto-Armenian &#x27;flat&#x27;. He remarks that semantically this is conceivable since this bread is specifically flat and thin.

Sevan Nişanyan connects the Persian word for lavash to the Aramaic root meaning &#x27;to knead&#x27; and recorded &quot;al-Faraj ba&#x27;d ash-Shiddah&quot; from 1451 as the oldest text to use the term in Turkish. Compare especially to Assyrian Neo-Aramaic &quot;lawasha,&quot; a flap of thin bread.

==History==
Gil Marks traces the history of lavash to the early innovation of cooking thin flatbreads on terracotta griddles. The earliest forms of bread were cooked as cakes either on heated rocks or in embers, but when griddles started to be used breads had to be made thinner to fully cook through without burning like the bread &quot;rakik&quot; described in the Bible. With the innovation of early ovens, thicker loaves became possible.

According to &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot; lavash is &quot;a thin unleavened flatbread of Armenian origin&quot;. In 2014, Lavash was described by the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity as &quot;an expression of Armenian culture&quot;. This decision led to protests in Azerbaijan, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan over claims that the food was &quot;regional&quot;, not &quot;Armenian&quot;.

The origin of lavash is often attributed to Armenia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein 1999 https://archive.org/details/tasteofrussia00darr/page/185 185&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Food historian Gil Marks identifies the origin more generally as the Middle East.

==Preparation==
Lavash is made with flour, water, yeast, sugar and salt. It can also be made in an unleavened version by omitting sugar and yeast. Toasted sesame seeds and/or poppy seeds are sometimes sprinkled on before baking. Traditionally the dough is rolled out flat and slapped against the hot walls of a clay oven, but modern recipes may adapt for cooking on a wok or &quot;tava&quot;.

==Usage==
While quite flexible when fresh, lavash dries out quickly and becomes brittle and hard. The soft form is easier to use when making wrap sandwiches.

In Armenian villages, dried lavash is stacked high in layers to be used later, and when the time comes to rehydrate the bread, it is sprinkled with water to make it softer again. The dried bread is broken up into (), while fresh lavash is used to wrap the Armenian specialty dish () and to make other wraps with herbs and cheese.

In Iran, Turkey and some Middle Eastern countries lavash is used with kebabs to make wraps like . In its dry form, leftover lavash is used in Iran to make quick meals after being rehydrated with water, butter, or cheese.

In Turkish cuisine can be used also for sweet dishes and served alongside some traditional Turkish dessert dishes like , , (&#x27;braised fruit leather&#x27;), and .

In Kashmiri cuisine, lavas is traditionally used with the morning tea, also known as Noon Chai or Sheer Chai.

In modern recipes lavash can be used like pizza dough.

==Traditions and customs==
In Armenia, it is traditional for the mother of the groom to feed the newly wed couple lavash and honey as a wish of good fortune, fertility and sweetness for the couple. Dried lavash can be stored over a long time period (almost one year) and is used instead of leavened bread in Eucharist traditions by the Armenian Apostolic Church.

In Sabirabad District of Azerbaijan after a wedding when the bride comes into her new house, her mother-in-law puts lavash on her shoulder and says: &quot;Let you come to the house of wealth, let your foot be lucky&quot;. In the Novkhani settlement, after a funeral, it is customary for people to prepare &quot;kyulchya&quot;, which sometimes consists of halva wrapped up in lavash.

==In art==
Women baking lavash is a common theme that has inspired Armenian painters. One such portrait by the famous Soviet-era painter Minas Minassian is displayed at the National Museum of Art in Yerevan. A print of the painting &quot;Armenian Ladies Baking Lavash&quot; by Armenian American artist Manuel Tolegian was selected by U.S. President Gerald Ford to hang in the White House Bicentennial Collection. The weekend open-air arts-and-crafts market in downtown Yerevan offers many lavash-related paintings and handiworks, with renditions of happy women making lavash having become a common sight.

Vancouver East is known as a New Democratic Party stronghold; the NDP and its Co-operative Commonwealth Federation predecessor have won all but two elections in the riding since its creation in 1933. Both losses (1974 and 1993) have come at the hands of Liberal candidates who failed to retain the seat at the next election. The Conservative Party and its right-leaning predecessors have always fared poorly in the riding, rarely garnering more than 20 percent of the vote.

In the 2006 federal election, the NDP won a higher percentage of the vote in Vancouver East than in any other riding in the country: 56.6 percent. In the 2011 election, the NDP increased its majority win to 62.83 percent.

==Geography==
The district includes the City of Vancouver neighbourhoods of Downtown Eastside, Mount Pleasant, Grandview–Woodland, and Hastings–Sunrise.

<text>Scrabble is an American television game show based upon the board game &quot;Scrabble&quot;. Contestants competed in a series of rounds to fill in words within a crossword puzzle for cash. Muriel Green of Exposure Unlimited developed the idea for a television game show based upon the board game concept. During 1983, Green convinced Selchow and Righter, who at that time owned the Scrabble board game, to license Exposure Unlimited to produce the game show. Exposure Unlimited co-produced the show with Hasbro Studios, Reg Grundy Productions, and licensed the show to NBC. &quot;Scrabble&quot; aired on NBC from July 2, 1984, to March 23, 1990, and again from January 18 to June 11, 1993. Chuck Woolery hosted the program. Jay Stewart was the announcer for the first year. Charlie Tuna replaced him in mid-1985 and remained through the original run and the entirety of the 1993 revival.

A revival of &quot;Scrabble&quot;, hosted by Raven-Symoné, premiered on October 3, 2024, on The CW.

==Game play==
All words used in the game were between five and nine letters in length. For each word, Woolery gave a clue that often involved a pun or play on words (e.g., &quot;Some people want him to get off their case&quot; for &quot;detective&quot;). Viewers could win a &quot;Scrabble&quot; T-shirt by submitting a word and clue and having them selected for use in the show&#x27;s opening title sequence.

===Crossword Round===
The first round of every game was the Crossword round, in which two contestants competed to guess words as they were laid out on a computer-generated Scrabble board. Each matchup in Crossword was always male vs. female and was played until one contestant won by solving three words.

Originally, the Crossword round was played to determine who would face the show’s returning champion, if there was one, in the Scrabble Sprint. In cases where there was no returning champion, two Crosswords were played and the winners faced each other in the Sprint to determine the new champion.

Beginning on September 29, 1986, as part of a broader format change, the show began featuring two Crossword rounds per episode. The winners would square off in the Sprint to determine the winner. The change was made as part of a special tournament that was taking place at the time. Once the show returned to regular play in December 1986, the first Crossword of the day began featuring the returning champion.

A horizontal or vertical row of squares was outlined to indicate the number of letters, with one already filled in and referred to as the letter the contestants were &quot;building on&quot;. The first word of each game was oriented horizontally and built on a letter placed in the center square of the board. Each subsequent word built on one of the letters in the previous word and was laid out perpendicular to it (i.e., the first word was played horizontally, the second vertically, and so on). If a game went on so long that the board became too crowded to hold any more words, it was cleared and the next was played horizontally from a letter in the center square.

Initially, the winner of a backstage coin toss got to start each game. When the second Crossword was introduced and the champion was inserted into the first game, his/her opponent started. If a champion retired after five days, a backstage coin toss in the first Crossword determined who began the first game. The second game used a coin toss to determine who began.

The contestant with initial control of a word could either try to guess it immediately or draw two numbered tiles from a rack. Each tile represented a letter, which was revealed on a screen when the contestant inserted it into a slot at his/her desk. Once a contestant had drawn, he/she could only guess after playing at least one of the two letters.

The number of tiles available for any given word was always two more than the number of letters it contained. These tiles represented all of the remaining letters in the word, plus three &quot;stopper&quot; letters that did not belong in it. When a contestant played a letter that belonged in the word, it appeared in its proper place. Hitting a stopper or giving an incorrect guess forfeited control of the word to the opponent, and the opponent could either guess or draw enough tiles to put a total of two letters in play.

Once all but one letter had been filled in, the contestant in control had to guess. A miss gave the opponent a chance to solve the word; if he/she also missed, the last letter was filled in and neither player scored the word.

For each word after the first, the trailing contestant had initial control. If the score was tied, control went to the contestant who had not solved the previous word.

If all three stoppers were revealed during a word, the contestant that had not played the last one was given a chance to guess. If he/she declined to do so, a rapid-fire game called &quot;Speedword&quot; was played. The remaining letters would be automatically placed, one at a time, until someone rang in with a correct guess; however, a miss locked that contestant out of the rest of the word. If both contestants missed, or if neither one rang in after every letter but one had been placed, the word was revealed and removed from play. If a contestant gave an incorrect guess after his/her opponent played the third stopper, the opponent was allowed to play Speedword alone.

Speedword was also played if a match went to a fifth word without a winner. Later, once the format changed, Speedword would be played if time ran short during a match. During the original show format, each match was played to its conclusion. A match could begin at any time and resume on the next episode. Originally, when this happened a fresh board would always be used when the match resumed. This later changed to having the same board in place for an entire match regardless of whether or not it straddled.

====Pot====
In the first seven shows, a cumulative money pot was used in the Crossword round. Each letter placed in a normal square was worth $25, with blue squares adding $50 and pink squares $100. The winner of the round collected all the money in the pot. After that week, the Crossword winner received a flat $500.

====Bonus squares====
Beginning in October 1984, contestants could win a cash bonus by placing a letter in a colored square and immediately solving the word. Blue squares awarded $500, while pink squares awarded $1,000. Beginning in 1985, the bonus rule was added to Speedword, provided a contestant guessed the word right after a letter was placed into a bonus square. Also, if a word was being built on a letter in a bonus square, the contestant who started the word could win the bonus with an immediate solve. If a contestant either placed a letter in a bonus square and gave an incorrect guess, or could not solve the word after placing the next-to-last letter in a bonus square, the opponent could win the bonus with a correct guess. Both contestants kept any bonus money they won, regardless of who won the Crossword round. The maximum a player could win in the crossword round was $3,500.

For the 1993 version, money won from bonus squares was added to the Bonus Sprint jackpot instead of being awarded directly to the contestant.

====Spelling format====
The Crossword rules and payout structure were changed in April 1985. Once the contestant in control believed they could solve a word, they hit their buzzer and then had to fill in all the missing letters in order, one at a time. A mistake turned control over to the opponent and left all correctly given letters on the board; the opponent could then either try to complete the solution, otherwise draw/play tiles if no letters had been filled in, or the word would be removed from play.

The accumulating pot from the earliest episodes returned, but money was added to it only while a contestant was giving letters after buzzing in. Regular, blue, and pink squares respectively added $50, $100, and $200 (later $500), and the first contestant to solve three words won the entire pot.

The format was changed back to the original Crossword format on September 2, 1985. In announcing the change, Chuck Woolery cited that popular demand had resulted in the decision.

A series of mistakes made by a pair of contestants during this period has made rounds on various game show and television blooper programs over the years. While it most likely had nothing to do with the show dropping the spelling format, two contestants proved unable to spell the word &quot;mosquitos&quot; despite knowing the solution.

===Scrabble Sprint===

The Scrabble Sprint round was the second part of the game and determined the show&#x27;s champion. In this round, the goal was to solve a set of words of increasing length as quickly as possible. There were two different formats.

From the premiere until September 26, 1986, the Crossword rounds were played to determine who faced the reigning champion in the Sprint Round. If there was no champion, two Crossword rounds were played and the winners of those rounds faced off to determine a new champion.

====First format====
In the first format, both the champion and the Crossword winner played separate sets of words against the clock. The Crossword winner played first and chose one of two envelopes, leaving the other for the champion. A row of blanks was shown, and Woolery read a clue. Once the contestant stated that he/she was ready, the clock began to count up from zero and two letters were displayed, which the contestant called one at a time to place in the word. Additional letters were then displayed one at a time, but as in Crossword, the last letter was not given. Every displayed letter appeared in the word; no stoppers were used in the Sprint.

Before trying to guess the word, the contestant had to press a plunger in order to stop the clock. If the guess was correct, the remaining letters were filled in; if not, or if the contestant did not immediately offer a guess, a 10-second penalty was added to the clock and play continued with the same word. Once all but one of the letters were placed, the contestant had five seconds to guess. If he/she either missed the word or did not press the plunger, the word was removed and an alternate was played.

Once the Crossword winner correctly solved three words, the champion took his/her turn with the unused envelope. The clock counted toward zero, starting at the Crossword winner&#x27;s final time, and any penalties were deducted from it. If the champion completed his/her words before time ran out, he/she won the Scrabble Sprint; if not, the opponent became the new champion. The prize for winning was originally three times the pot from the preceding Crossword round, but was changed to a flat $1,500 after the first week. A contestant received a $20,000 bonus for winning five consecutive Sprints, and a further $20,000 for winning 10; in the latter case, the contestant also retired as an undefeated champion.

=====March 1985 changes=====
In March 1985, both contestants began using the same set of words. The champion was placed in isolation while the Crossword winner played, then tried to beat the time set. In addition, after a contestant called one of the two displayed letters, the other one disappeared and two new letters were presented as long as there were at least three blanks left in the word. The contestant was shown only one letter when there were two blanks. This change remained in place for the remainder of the series run, and a fourth word was later added to the Sprint.

In addition to the contestants now using the same set of words, the Sprint bonus rules changed. Champions had their total winnings increased to $20,000 for five Sprint victories, or to $40,000 for 10, still retiring undefeated in the latter case.

====Second format====
On September 29, 1986, &quot;Scrabble&quot; began a 13-week-long contest titled &quot;The $100,000 All-American Scrabble Tournament&quot;. This tournament was conducted with a different format from usual &quot;Scrabble&quot; matches, and these changes were eventually made permanent.

A total of 188 contestants were selected via a nationwide search, with four competing on each episode in preliminary matches from Monday through Thursday over the first 12 weeks. Two Crossword rounds were played, each worth $500 and with the bonus square payouts in effect, and each was followed by a four-word Scrabble Sprint. The first Crossword winner set a time for the second one to beat, and the Sprint winner received $1,000 and advanced to a quarterfinal match played on Friday of that week. The winner of the Sprint round in that match received an additional $5,000 and advanced to the semifinals, held during the 13th and final week of the tournament.

Only three episodes were broadcast during the week of November 24–28, due to NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade and a special block of Saturday morning cartoons airing on Thursday and Friday of that week, respectively. A quarterfinal match was held on the following Monday (December 1) to choose a semifinalist from those three preliminary winners; over the remainder of that week (December 2–5), three more preliminary matches and a quarterfinal were played in similar fashion.

Four wild-card semifinalists were chosen from the eliminated contestants, and they and the 12 quarterfinal winners competed in four semifinal matches on Monday through Thursday of the final week. The four winners advanced to a final match that Friday; the winner of the Sprint received a grand prize of $100,000, while the runner-up received $10,000.

With slight adjustments, this tournament structure became the new permanent &quot;Scrabble&quot; format on December 29, 1986. As noted above, each episode now featured four contestants and two Crossword games worth $500 each. The champion played in the first Crossword, whose winner set a Sprint time for the second winner to beat, and the Sprint winner received $1,000 and took or retained the championship. With this format change, each episode of &quot;Scrabble&quot; became a self-contained competition and straddling games were eliminated.

===Bonus Sprint===
With the adoption of the new format came a new final round, the Bonus Sprint, which gave the day&#x27;s champion a chance to win a cash jackpot.

The champion played two words, one each of at least six and seven letters, under the standard Sprint rules and was given 10 seconds to solve them both. Doing so awarded the jackpot, which began at $5,000 and increased by $1,000 for every game it went unclaimed. If the champion gave an incorrect guess or failed to respond immediately after pressing the plunger, the round ended.

Champions remained on the show until they lost in either the Crossword or Sprint round or had played the Bonus Sprint five times.

====1993 changes====
When the series returned in 1993, the Bonus Sprint jackpot began at $1,000 and increased only if a contestant landed on a blue or pink square in the Crossword game and solved the word immediately, adding either $500 or $1,000 respectively. No cash bonuses were given directly to contestants in this version. The Bonus Sprint jackpot carried over from one episode to the next until it was won.

==Other Tournaments==
During the 1984–90 run, &quot;Scrabble&quot; held occasional tournaments, including two Tournament of Champions in February 1985 and May 1986, a $25,000 TV Game Players Vs. Board Game Players tournament in November 1985, a $50,000 Teen Tournament in July 1986, and the aforementioned All-American Tournament. In the February 1985 tournament the final grand prize was determined by the amount of $500 and $1,000 bonuses won in the Crossword Round, with $35,000 as the base amount, a payout structure later used for the Bonus Sprint in the 1993 revival. The other tournament in May 1986 was played for $50,000.

==Licensed merchandise==
A board game based on this version was released by Selchow &amp; Righter as &quot;TV Scrabble&quot; in 1987. It was the only home version which was originally a board game itself until &quot;Trivial Pursuit: Game Show&quot; released by Parker Brothers in 1993 and &quot;Celebrity Name Game&quot; released by &quot;Playmonster&quot; (formerly &quot;Patch&quot;) in 2016.

==Broadcast history==

===Original run===
&quot;Scrabble&quot; premiered in the 11:30 am time slot on July 2, 1984. The time slot had been occupied by the Bob Eubanks-hosted game show &quot;Dream House&quot; for the past 20 months. The show went up against the highly-rated CBS game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and four ABC game shows (&quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;All-Star Blitz&quot;, &quot;Double Talk&quot;, and &quot;Bargain Hunters&quot;) in its time slot during the first three years of its run. On September 7, 1987, &quot;Scrabble&quot; was moved to the 12:30p.m. time slot in order to make room for the daytime version of &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; (replacing &quot;Wordplay&quot;, which had been canceled by NBC earlier that summer). The competitors in that time slot were the soap operas &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;Loving&quot;. The show lasted years in that time slot, as it was moved to the 10:00a.m. time slot on March 27, 1989 after both &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; (another Reg Grundy show) and &quot;Super Password&quot; ended their runs. The 12:30p.m. time slot was taken over by the soap opera &quot;Generations&quot;. &quot;Scrabble&quot; aired against the CBS version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; in that time slot, and remained there until its final episode aired on March 23, 1990. Three days later, the show&#x27;s time slot was occupied by reruns of &quot;227&quot;.

===1993 revival===
In late 1992, NBC cancelled the soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; after an eight-year run. The network then announced it was trading the 3:00pm timeslot back to its affiliates in exchange for the 12:00pm timeslot from its affiliates; NBC was to bring back &quot;Scrabble&quot; and pair it with a new program based on the board game &quot;Scattergories&quot; hosted by Dick Clark in the noon hour.

However, not all of NBC&#x27;s affiliates would air the revived &quot;Scrabble&quot; at its scheduled time due to their continuing practice of airing local newscasts or other syndicated programming in the 12:00pm hour; this resulted in some NBC stations airing the show in a different spot on their schedule while others did not air it at all, often relegating it to independent stations in some media markets. In the markets that did air &quot;Scrabble&quot; at its scheduled time, the show faced off against local programming on other network affiliates, but never fared well enough against them. As a result, NBC canceled &quot;Scrabble&quot; after twenty-one weeks of episodes and aired its last episode on June 11, 1993. The show was then replaced on June 14 by reruns of &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; which moved to 12:00pm from a half-hour earlier and remained there until its final airing on December 31, 1993.

==2024 revival==
In February 2024, it was announced that &quot;Scrabble&quot; would be revived and would move to The CW, with Raven-Symoné as host. The revival was promoted as a &quot;straight&quot; adaptation of the board game that would depart from the Woolery version. The revival premiered on October 3, 2024.

<doc id="630066" wikidata="Q1058850" url="?curid=630066" title="SS John W. Brown">
<text>SS &quot;John W. Brown&quot; is a Liberty ship, one of two still operational and one of three preserved as museum ships. As a Liberty ship, she operated as a merchant ship of the United States Merchant Marine during World War II and later was a vocational high school training ship in New York City for many years. Now preserved, she is a museum ship and cruise ship berthed at Pier 13 in Baltimore Harbor in Maryland.

&quot;John W. Brown&quot; was named after the Canadian-born American labor union leader John W. Brown (1867–1941).

The other surviving operational Liberty ship is in San Francisco, California. A third Liberty ship, SS &quot;Hellas Liberty&quot; (ex-) is preserved as a static museum ship in Piraeus, Greece.

==Construction==

The United States Maritime Commission ordered &quot;John W. Brown&quot; as an ECS-S-C1 Maritime Commission Emergency Cargo Ship, the type of ship that would become popularly known as the &quot;Liberty ship&quot;, hull number 312 on 1 May 1941. She was laid down at the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard in Baltimore, Maryland, on 28 July 1942 and – sponsored by Annie Green, the wife of the president of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers – was launched on 7 September 1942, the third of three Liberty ships launched at the yard that day. She completed fitting out on 19 September 1942, making her total construction time only 54 days. She required about 500,000 man-hours and cost $1,750,000 to build and was the 62nd of the 384 Liberty ships constructed at the Bethlehem-Fairfield yard.

The Worthington Pump &amp; Machine Corporation of Harrison, New Jersey, built &quot;John W. Brown&quot;″s vertical triple expansion steam engine, which cost $100,000.

==Service history==

===World War II===

Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard delivered &quot;John W. Brown&quot; to her owner, the Maritime Commission, on the day of her completion. With States Marine Corporation as her general agent, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; was operated initially by the War Shipping Administration and later by the United States Army&#x27;s Army Transport Service.
After ten more days of post-delivery work in Baltimore to prepare her to get underway, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; departed on 29 September 1942 to steam down the Chesapeake Bay to Norfolk, Virginia, where she underwent degaussing and deperming to make her less likely to trigger magnetic sea mines. Departing Norfolk, she proceeded back north through the Chesapeake Bay, anchored off Annapolis, Maryland, overnight on 3–4 October 1942, and then passed through the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and Delaware River to Delaware Bay, where she joined a convoy of four merchant ships. Escorted by three escort vessels and a United States Navy blimp, the convoy proceeded up the coast of New Jersey to New York City, where on 6 October 1942 &quot;John W. Brown&quot; began loading her first cargo – 8,381 long tons (9,387 short tons; 8,515 metric tons) of cargo destined for the Soviet Union, consisting of two Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters, 10 M4 Sherman tanks, 200 motorcycles, 100 jeeps, over 700 long tons (784 short tons, 711 metric tons) of ammunition, and over 250 long tons (280 short tons, 254 metric tons) of canned pork lunch meat – at Pier 17 in Brooklyn. While in New York, she also had the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon mounted on her bow replaced by a /50-caliber gun, and she interrupted her loading of cargo on 9 October 1942 for work on the degaussing and compass adjusting ranges.

====Maiden voyage, October 1942–March 1943====

With loading complete on 14 October 1942, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; departed New York on 15 October on her maiden voyage, bound for the Persian Gulf, where she would unload her cargo for delivery overland to the Soviet Union. Her 14,400-nautical mile (16,560-statute mile; 26,667-km) route was designed to allow her to avoid the areas where Axis forces posed the greatest threats to shipping. She made the first leg of the voyage in convoy, steaming down the United States East Coast to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where she joined another convoy for the trip across the Caribbean Sea to the Panama Canal. After passing through the canal and reaching the Pacific Ocean, she steamed alone down the west coast of South America, requiring two weeks to reach Cape Horn. She then made a 17-day independent crossing of the South Atlantic Ocean to Cape Town, South Africa, where she stopped for two days to refuel and reprovision. Getting back underway, she steamed alone north through the western Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa, and anchored in the Persian Gulf on 25 December 1942, two and a half months after leaving New York.

Ports in the Persian Gulf were overwhelmed by the amount of cargo arriving from Allied countries, and so &quot;John W. Brown&quot; was forced to lie at anchor for a month until she could begin to unload at Abadan, Iran, where she dropped off the two P-40s and some of the tanks in late January 1943. It took another month and a half until she could enter port at Khorramshahr, Iran, and unload the rest of her cargo in March 1943.
On 16 March 1943, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; got underway to return to the United States. She steamed south from the Persian Gulf along the east coast of Africa to Cape Town, again calling there for two days before making a two-week crossing of the South Atlantic to Bahia, Brazil, where she arrived on 23 April 1943. There she joined a convoy to steam north to Paramaribo in Surinam, proceeded upriver to Paranam to load bauxite, then steamed to Port of Spain, Trinidad, to load more bauxite. Fully loaded, she joined a convoy to steam to Guantanamo Bay and then another convoy for the final leg of her voyage to New York City, where she arrived on 27 May 1943 to complete a maiden voyage of about eight months.

====Conversion to troopship====

&quot;John W. Brown&quot;″s maiden voyage was her only one as a standard cargo ship. After returning to the United States, she became the first of 220 Liberty ships to undergo conversion into a &quot;Limited Capacity Troopship&quot; capable of transporting up to 450, 550, or 650 (sources vary) troops or prisoners-of-war. Her modifications – which took place at Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation″s Hoboken Shipyard in Hoboken, New Jersey – included the installation of bunks stacked five deep for the embarked passengers on her forward tweendeck, additional shower and head facilities for them, two additional diesel-powered generators, and the installation of two more Oerlikon 20-mm automatic cannons.

====Second voyage June–August 1943====

After completion of her conversion at Hoboken, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; returned to New York to load for her second voyage, her first as a troopship. Her 5,023 long tons (5,626 short tons; 5,103 metric tons) of cargo consisted mostly of food, and her passenger list included 306 men – seven United States Army officers, 145 U.S. Army military policemen, three enlisted medical assistants, three Royal Navy officers, and 148 Royal Navy sailors; the Royal Navy personnel were all survivors of a torpedoed ship. She departed New York on 24 June 1943, steamed in convoy to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to meet another part of the convoy, and then set out in convoy for a transatlantic crossing. The convoy transited the Strait of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean Sea on 18 July 1943, and &quot;John W. Brown&quot; arrived at Algiers in French Algeria on 20 July 1943. There she unloaded her cargo and disembarked all of her passengers except for 38 U.S. Army personnel who remained aboard to guard 500 German prisoners-of-war – veterans of the Afrika Korps – that she took aboard to transport to the United States. She departed Algiers on 5 August 1943 and returned in convoy to Hampton Roads, where the convoy arrived safely on 26 August 1943 after a passage in which there were many submarine alerts but no enemy attacks. The German prisoners had all disembarked by the following day.

====Third voyage, September 1943–March 1944====

For her third voyage, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; loaded a cargo of 7,845.5 measurement tons (314,180 cubic feet; 8,889 cubic meters) of TNT, gasoline, and general cargo and took aboard 339 U.S. Army personnel – 36 officers and 303 enlisted men – as passengers. Departing Hampton Roads in convoy on 15 September 1943, she arrived at Oran in French Algeria on 4 October 1943 after an uneventful trip. Her passengers disembarked there on 6 October, and she completed unloading her cargo on 15 October. She embarked 15 officers and 346 men of the U.S. Army″s 1st Armored Division and loaded 274 of the division″s vehicles, including 61 tanks.

On 1 November 1943, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; departed Oran in convoy on the first of eight Mediterranean shuttle trips she would make during the voyage. After a stop at Augusta, Sicily, her convoy arrived safely at Naples, Italy, on 7 November. She completed unloading there on 11 November, and departed empty on 12 November, proceeding in convoy to Augusta, where she stopped for four days, and then on to Oran, where her convoy arrived on 22 November 1943. After taking aboard 241 American and Free French troops, 261 tank destroyers, trucks, and cars, and a load of asphalt there, she departed in convoy on 30 November and arrived at Naples on 7 December 1943.

Unloaded by 9 December, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; again left Naples empty on 10 December 1943 in a convoy which stopped for three days at Augusta and then proceeded to Bizerte, Tunisia, where it arrived on 16 December 1943. There she embarked six Free French officers and 305 Free French enlisted men, and loaded 958 tons of trucks, trailers, weapon carriers, ambulances, and cars. She then proceeded in convoy to Pozzuoli Bay, Italy, arriving there on 26 December 1943. On 27 December, the Liberty ship rode over &quot;John W. Brown&quot;″s anchor cable and collided with her starboard side, causing significant damage. Despite the damage, she continued her voyage, unloading her cargo at Naples and departing empty on 4 January 1944, joining a convoy to Oran which arrived on 10 January. On 13 January, she moved to Mostaganem, French Algeria, where she loaded 5,000 tons of gasoline; she then transported the gasoline to Oran. Unloading it, she took aboard 263 passengers, 186 vehicles, and 799 tons of engineering equipment and supplies; she departed Oran on 29 January, stopped at Augusta, and arrived at Naples on 5 February to discharge her passengers and cargo.

&quot;John W. Brown&quot; embarked 106 U.S. Army and 13 U.S. Navy personnel and steamed out of Naples on 10 January 1944 in a convoy which stopped at Augusta – where she took a Royal Navy lieutenant aboard – and proceeded to Bizerte, arriving on 14 February 1944. There she dropped off her passengers and loaded a cargo of scrap metal and the personal effects of deceased soldiers.
On 21 February 1944, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; departed Bizerte in convoy to return to the United States. The following day, the German submarine &quot;U-969&quot; attacked the convoy, and the Liberty ships , only 500 yards (457 m) ahead of her, and , only 850 yards (777 m) off her starboard bow, suffered torpedo hits causing such severe damage that both ships had to beach themselves and became total losses, but &quot;John W. Brown&quot; was left unharmed. Her convoy faced several more submarine alerts, but no further enemy attacks occurred, and enemy contacts ceased entirely after the convoy passed through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic on 25 February 1944. The transatlantic crossing was uneventful except for rough weather, and &quot;John W. Brown&quot; arrived at New York on 17 March 1944 to complete her third voyage.

On 23 March 1944, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; steamed up the Hudson River to Yonkers, New York, where she entered Blair Shipyard for repairs to the damage suffered during the collision with &quot;Zebulon Pike&quot; and to have two more 3-inch 50-caliber guns and quarters for additional United States Navy Armed Guard personnel to man them. The installation of the guns brought her up to her ultimate armament.

====Fourth voyage, April–September 1944====

Her repairs and alterations complete, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; steamed to Brooklyn, where on 3 April 1944 she began to load a cargo of high explosives. She departed New York on 10 April to begin her fourth voyage in a convoy to Hampton Roads, where additional ships joined her convoy for a transatlantic passage. The convoy departed Hampton Roads on 13 April 1944 and, despite several alerts, crossed peacefully, transited the Strait of Gibraltar on 29 April 1944, and divided during a 5 May stop at Augusta, where &quot;John W. Brown&quot; and her section of the convoy left the other ships to steam to Naples, arriving there on 8 May. Discharging her cargo there, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; embarked five U.S. Army officers and 170 U.S. Army enlisted men and loaded a cargo of 3,322 tons of high explosives and gasoline. She left Naples on 18 April, arriving off the Anzio beachhead the following day, and was present there when the Allies finally broke out of the beachhead on 23 April after a lengthy campaign. She got underway on 24 April and arrived in Naples on 25 April.

On 26 April, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; embarked 336 German prisoners-of-war and one U.S. Army officer and 38 U.S. Army enlisted men to guard them. With a stop in Augusta, she transported them in convoy to Bizerte, where she arrived on 31 May 1944, disembarked them, and loaded 406 U.S. Army personnel and 939 tons of cargo. Departing on 10 June 1944, she steamed in convoy to Naples, arriving on 14 June to load C rations, life preservers, and life rafts. She then left Naples on 24 June and proceeded in convoy to the Anzio beachhead and discharged her passengers and cargo. On 26 June, she embarked about 1,000 French colonial troops and transported them to Naples, arriving there on 27 June. She departed on 29 June in a convoy to Cagliari, Sardinia, where she embarked 1,017 Italian Co-Belligerent Army troops fighting on the Allied side; she then joined a convoy to Naples, arriving there on 3 July 1944 and disembarking the Italians on 4 July. Next, she repeated the trip, leaving Naples in convoy on 5 July for Cagliari, where she loaded a cargo of ammunition and embarked 144 Royal Air Force personnel and 759 Italian Co-Belligerent Army troops for transportation in convoy to Naples, arriving there on 9 July 1944.

&quot;John W. Brown&quot; spent the next five weeks at anchor at Naples during preparations for Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. While there, she was dressed overall for the 24 July 1944 tour of the harbor by King George VI of the United Kingdom. Although fully loaded with cargo, 15 U.S. Army officers, and 299 U.S. Army enlisted men by 29 July 1944, she remained at anchor until 13 August, when she finally got underway for the invasion, passing as she left Naples a British destroyer from which British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was flashing his &quot;V for Victory&quot; sign at the passing ships. Her convoy steamed west across the Tyrrhenian Sea, passed through the Strait of Bonifacio into the western Mediterranean Sea, and then proceeded north off the west coast of Corsica and finally northwest to the south coast of France. &quot;John W. Brown&quot; arrived off the beachhead at Bougnon Bay at 18:00 on 15 August 1944, ten hours after the initial landings, and began unloading her troops and their equipment on 16 August, completing the process on 21 August. During her stay off the beachhead, there were numerous German air attacks and alerts in her vicinity, peaking at six alerts on 17 August; her U.S. Navy Armed Guard gunners may have shot down one German plane during Operation Dragoon, but its destruction was never confirmed.

Unloading completed, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; left the beachhead on 21 August and returned in convoy to Naples, where she arrived on 23 August. She embarked 500 German prisoners-of-war and 33 U.S. Army personnel to guard them on 3 September 1944, departed Naples in convoy the next day, stopped at Augusta, and then left in convoy for the United States. Her convoy had a quiet passage except for heavy weather which worsened as she approached the U.S. East Coast. She arrived at Hampton Roads on 28 September, disembarked the prisoners-of-war at Newport News, Virginia, on 29 September, and then steamed north up the Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore, where she arrived on 30 September 1944 to conclude her fourth voyage.

====Fifth voyage, October–December 1944====

&quot;John W. Brown&quot; got underway from Baltimore on 19 October 1944 for her fifth voyage and proceeded to Hampton Roads, where she joined a convoy for a transatlantic passage. Carrying 356 passengers – including 30 United States Army Air Forces fighter pilots and troops of the all-African American 758th Tank Battalion – she departed Hampton Roads in convoy on 22 October 1944. The convoy encountered very bad weather during its trip but did not come under enemy attack, and &quot;John W. Brown&quot; arrived at Augusta safely on 14 November 1944. She continued on to Naples in convoy on 16 November, arriving the following day. After disembarking the fighter pilots there, she departed on 23 November and moved on to Leghorn, where she discharged her cargo and the rest of her passengers. She loaded mail, steamed to Naples in convoy from 4 to 6 December, loaded cargo, and then departed for Oran, for the first time in her career steaming alone in Mediterranean waters – even burning her running lights at night – thanks to the control the Allies had achieved there by December 1944. Arriving at Oran on 11 December, she unloaded her cargo, and then departed in convoy on 13 December 1944 bound for the United States. Braving high winds and enormous waves but encountering no enemy forces, her convoy arrived safely at New York on 29 December 1944.

====Sixth voyage, January–March 1945====

On 9 January 1945, &quot;John W. Brown&quot;, steaming independently, departed New York on her sixth voyage, carrying U.S. Army general cargo and, after a brief stop at Hampton Roads, arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 12 January. She loaded more cargo, left Charleston on 17 January, and proceeded independently back to Hampton Roads, arriving there on 19 January. She embarked 54 U.S. Army passengers at Newport News and departed on 23 January in convoy for Naples, at first facing heavy weather but otherwise making an uneventful transatlantic crossing. After passing through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea, she left the convoy on 7 February to steam independently to Naples; her engineers shut down her port boiler when it began to malfunction on 9 February, forcing her to continue at reduced speed, but she arrived safely at Naples on 11 February 1945. She disembarked her passengers and repaired her boiler, then left for Leghorn, where she arrived on 19 February. After unloading her cargo, she departed on 27 February, stopped at Piambino, and arrived at Naples on 1 March 1945. She steamed to Oran independently between 2 and 5 March with her running lights burning at night. On 8 March she departed Oran bound for New York in convoy. During the crossing, her port boiler began to malfunction again on 14 February. With her speed reduced, she dropped out of the convoy and proceeded independently as a straggler, but after the boiler was repaired on 16 February she returned to full speed; forgoing the prescribed zigzag steaming pattern for stragglers, she managed to overtake and rejoin her convoy, and arrived with it at New York on 24 March 1945.

&quot;John W. Brown&quot; was taken under repair by Atlantic Basin Iron Works in Brooklyn from 7 to 11 April to have her balky boiler fixed and have a gyrocompass installed.

====Seventh voyage, April–June 1945====

On 23 April 1945, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; left in convoy with a load of U.S. Army general cargo below and trucks lashed to her decks to begin her seventh voyage. The convoy encountered bad weather but no enemy forces while crossing the North Atlantic and arrived off The Downs on the southeast coast of England on V-E Day, 8 May 1945. She then proceeded to Antwerp, Belgium, where she discharged her cargo. Departing on 19 May, she arrived at Le Havre, France, on 22 May. There she embarked 31 U.S. Army officers and 321 U.S. Army enlisted men, some of them liberated prisoners-of-war, and departed on 24 May. She paused in The Solent for two days, then got back underway on 27 May in convoy for the United States, the convoy burning its running lights at night for the first time since the beginning of the war. The convoy arrived at New York on 11 June 1945.

&quot;John W. Brown&quot; disembarked some of her U.S. Navy Armed Guard personnel at New York and left on 20 June 1945 bound for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where all but four of her remaining Armed Guard personnel left the ship.

====Eighth voyage, June–August 1945====

On 3 July 1945, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; left Philadelphia on her eighth voyage. She discharged her cargo at Antwerp, took aboard 419 U.S. Army troops, and departed on 28 July. She arrived at New York to discharge her passengers on 11 August 1945.

On 15 August 1945 (14 August in the United States), V-J Day brought World War II to an end.

===Post-war===
From 17 August to 10 September 1945, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; underwent alterations at the J. K. Welding Company in Yonkers which increased her troop-carrying capacity to 562. On 13 September 1945, all of her guns were removed, and her last four Navy Armed Guard personnel were detached.

====Ninth voyage, September–November 1945====
&quot;John W. Brown&quot; began her ninth voyage on 15 September 1945, departing New York. Arriving in Baltimore the next day, she departed on 25 September 1945 with a cargo of grain. She arrived at Marseille, France, on 15 October, where she unloaded the grain and embarked 645 U.S. Army personnel, 83 more than her official capacity. She then returned to New York, arriving on 14 November 1945. She soon had radar installed at the Bethlehem Brooklyn 56th Street shipyard in Brooklyn.

====Tenth voyage, November 1945–January 1946====

The ship″s tenth voyage began on 20 November 1945. &quot;John W. Brown&quot; proceeded up the Hudson River to Albany, New York, where she loaded a cargo of wheat before returning to New York City. On 1 December 1945, she departed New York City and steamed to Naples, arriving there on 20 December 1945. She departed Naples on 3 January 1946 and proceeded to Marseilles, where she arrived on 6 January and embarked 564 men of the U.S. Army″s 100th Infantry Division. On 7 January she got underway for New York, arriving there on 26 January 1946 to discharge the troops. It was her last voyage as a troopship. During her career, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; had carried nearly 10,000 troops, including the two shiploads of German prisoners-of-war that she transported from North Africa to the United States.

====Eleventh voyage, February–April 1946====

&quot;John W. Brown&quot; got underway from New York to begin her eleventh voyage on 16 February 1946. She transited the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and steamed down the Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore, where she took on a cargo of coal at the Curtis Bay Coal Pier. Leaving on 20 February, she steamed to Copenhagen, Denmark, where she arrived on 11 March 1946. After unloading the coal, she embarked ten civilian airline pilots – nine men and one woman – under United States Government contract to fly planes to Denmark. Departing Copenhagen on 21 March, she returned to Baltimore, arriving there on 6 April 1946. She lay idle for the next two and a half months.

====Twelfth voyage, June–July 1946====

Finally getting underway again, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; departed Baltimore on 18 June 1946 to begin her twelfth voyage. Carrying a general cargo, she steamed to Hamburg, Germany, where she arrived on 4 or 5 July. After unloading, she departed Hamburg on 9 July and steamed to New York, arriving there on 23 July 1946.

====Thirteenth voyage, August–November 1946====

&quot;John W. Brown&quot; departed New York on 9 August 1946 to begin her thirteenth and final voyage. She steamed to Galveston, Texas, and then on to Houston, Texas, where she loaded a cargo of grain. She then steamed from Houston to Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom, where she arrived on 22 October 1946. After unloading her cargo there, she proceeded to London, where she arrived on 29 October and took a small cargo aboard. Departing London on 1 November 1946, she steamed to New York, arriving there on 15 November 1946. After she unloaded her cargo, &quot;John W. Brown&quot;″s final voyage officially was completed on 19 November 1946, bringing her seagoing career to an end.

===Training ship===

New York City″s Metropolitan Vocational High School had been without a ship for the training of boys interested in seafaring careers since its school ship, the New York City ferryboat &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, had been returned to the city at the end of World War II. In August 1946, the Maritime Commission and the City of New York signed a letter of agreement under which the Maritime Commission would loan &quot;John W. Brown&quot; – whose tweendeck modifications to carry troops gave her a large amount of internal space suitable for classroom use – to the city for educational purposes at no charge, with the city responsible for all expenses related to maintaining the ship and operating her as a static training ship. After &quot;John W. Brown&quot; completed her final voyage in November 1946, she was towed to her new berth at Manhattan″s Pier 4 on the East River on 13 December 1946 to enter service as SS &quot;John W. Brown&quot; High School, the only floating nautical high school in the United States. The ship served in that capacity as a static training facility from 1946 to 1982, graduating thousands of students prepared to begin careers at sea in the merchant marine, the United States Navy, and the United States Coast Guard. By 1950, she had moved to a new berth at Manhattan″s Pier 43 on the East River at the foot of East 25th Street.

Training aboard &quot;John W. Brown&quot; began in December 1946, many of the early students being men who had dropped out of classes at the Metropolitan Vocational High School during World War II to serve as merchant mariners or in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard. Students studied standard academic subjects and took boat building, marine radio, marine electrician, and maritime business classes in the high school″s main building ashore; aboard &quot;John W. Brown&quot; they learned their seafaring trade, either as deck hands, engine room personnel, or stewards, and they also performed all maintenance and repairs the ship required. Students at first spent a week at a time in the building and a week at a time on the ship; later, the schedule changed so that they spent half of each school day in the building and the other half aboard the ship. The Maritime Educational Advisory Commission also met regularly aboard the ship and worked closely with the school″s staff.

Graduates enjoyed an excellent reputation in the maritime industry. Between 1951 and 1955, 80 percent of the school″s graduates gained employment in the maritime industry or in seagoing agencies and forces of the United States Government, a record rivaling that of the United States Merchant Marine Academy, while 40 percent of those who did not complete the course of study and left school at age 17 also secured such jobs. The U.S. Coast Guard also granted additional credit to the school″s graduates toward earning a Lifeboat Certificate.

By late 1956, the decline of the American merchant marine, budget problems in New York City, the expense of maintaining, repairing, and operating &quot;John W. Brown&quot;, and the cost of busing students between the school″s main building and the ship had created financial difficulties for the high school that it would never fully overcome. New York City officials gave thought to ending the maritime vocational training program and closing the school, but cost-cutting measures were instituted, such as returning in September 1957 to the schedule of having students study in the school″s building for a week at time and aboard ship for a week at time, eliminating the expense of busing. However, continuing budget problems finally led to the school closing in mid-1982, and &quot;John W. Brown&quot; remained idle in New York Harbor for the next year.

==Restoration and heritage==

When &quot;John W. Brown&quot;″s school-ship days ended, the first Project Liberty Ship was formed in New York City to preserve her. It did not succeed in finding her a berth in New York, and instead she was towed to the James River Reserve Fleet near Norfolk, Virginia, in July 1983 with her future in doubt.

In August 1988, Project Liberty Ship found &quot;John W. Brown&quot; a berth in Baltimore, Maryland, near where she was built and had her towed there. In September 1988, she was dedicated as a memorial museum at ceremonies at Dundalk Marine Terminal in Dundalk, Maryland.

After three years of restoration effort, on 24 August 1991 &quot;John W. Brown&quot; steamed under her own power for the first time in nearly 45 years, and completed sea trials in the same waters in the Chesapeake Bay where she had completed her original sea trials in 1942. Four weeks later, on 21 September 1991, two days after the 49th anniversary of her completion, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; carried about 600 members and guests on her &quot;matron voyage&quot;, her inaugural cruise.

In 1994, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; received U.S. Coast Guard certification for coastwise ocean voyages. In April 1994, she made her first offshore voyage since 1946, steaming to New York Harbor, and in August 1994 she made her first foreign voyage as a museum ship, steaming to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, then stopping at Boston, Massachusetts, and Greenport, New York, on her way back to Baltimore.

&quot;John W. Brown&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 17 November 1997. In 2000, she visited the Great Lakes for drydocking and hull work in Toledo, Ohio.

In addition to her floating museum role, &quot;John W. Brown&quot; still gets underway several times a year for six-hour &quot;Living History Cruises&quot; that take the ship through Baltimore Harbor, down the Patapsco River, and into the Chesapeake Bay. Each cruise includes tours of the ship, discussions of the role of the U.S. merchant marine, Liberty ships, and American women in World War II, reenactments of the activities of the ship″s World War II U.S. Navy Armed Guard, flybys and simulated attacks on the ship by World War II aircraft, and entertainment by a barbershop quartet and singers, comedians, and actors imitating such World War II figures as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Andrews Sisters, and Abbott and Costello. As of the end of the 2013 cruising season, she had completed her 97th Living History Cruise and had visited 29 ports along the United States East Coast and the Atlantic coast of Canada and in the Great Lakes. She is the largest cruise ship operating under the American flag on the United States East Coast.

<doc id="630068" wikidata="Q140346" url="?curid=630068" title="1516 Henry">
<text>1516 Henry, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 20 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 28 January 1938, by French astronomer André Patry at Nice Observatory in southeastern France. It is named for French astronomers and opticians, Paul and Prosper Henry.

== Orbit and classification ==

The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.1–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,551 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic. No precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made. &quot;Henry&quot;″s observation arc starts at Nice in August 1939, or 19 months after its official discovery observation.

== Physical characteristics ==

In May 2005, a rotational lightcurve of &quot;Henry&quot; was obtained by French amateur astronomer Christophe Demeautis. It gave a rotation period of 17.370 hours with a brightness variation of 0.54 magnitude (). In February 2010, photometric observations by David Polishook and others at the Californian Palomar Transient Factory gave a divergent period of 10 hours with an amplitude of only 0.04 ().

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Henry&quot; measures between 19.19 and 28.55 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.039 and 0.070. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; derives an albedo of 0.0701 and a diameter of 19.98 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.0.

== Naming ==

This minor planet is named for the two brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry (1848–1905 and 1849–1903, respectively), who each discovered seven asteroids. As opticians, they constructed the 76-cm refracting telescope at Nice Observatory, among others. While mapping the ecliptic during their &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot; survey, they made all their fourteen, low-numbered asteroid discoveries, starting with 125 Liberatrix.

The Henry Brothers are also honored by the lunar crater Henry Frères. The Martian crater &quot;Henry&quot; was named in honour of Paul. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 April 1978 ().

<doc id="630070" wikidata="Q63853" url="?curid=630070" title="1509 Esclangona">
<text>1509 Esclangona, provisional designation , is a rare-type Hungaria asteroid and binary system from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 8 kilometers in diameter. It is named after French astronomer Ernest Esclangon.

== Discoveries ==

&quot;Esclangona&quot; was discovered on 21 December 1938, by French astronomer André Patry at Nice Observatory. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation as no precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made. On 13 February 2003, a minor-planet moon in orbit of &quot;Esclangona&quot; was discovered by astronomers at ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope (UT4) on Cerro Paranal in Chile.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Esclangona&quot; is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.8–1.9 AU once every 2 years and 7 months (931 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.03 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic.

== Binary system ==

&quot;Esclangona&quot; has a small moon, provisionally named , which measures 4 kilometers in diameter, and orbits 140 kilometers from its parent. This wide separation relative to the pair&#x27;s size is rather unusual and it is believed that both &quot;Esclangona&quot; and its moon are ejecta from an asteroidal collision in the past that left the scene as a co-orbiting pair; a similar pairing is 3749 Balam and its moon.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the Tholen taxonomy, &quot;Esclangona&quot; is a common stony S-type asteroid. It has since been characterized as a rare K-type asteroid by polarimetric observations.

=== Rotation period ===

In December 2004, photometric measurements of &quot;Esclangona&quot; made by American astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory, California, showed a lightcurve with a rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of in magnitude.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Esclangona&quot; measures between 6.83 and 9.87 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.107 and 0.41. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; derives an albedo of 0.2041 and a diameter of 8.18 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.858.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after French astronomer Ernest Esclangon (1876–1954), was a director of the Paris Observatory and president of the International Astronomical Union. Naming citation was first mentioned in &quot;The Names of the Minor Planets&quot; by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

<text>Yukon is a federal electoral district covering the entire territory of Yukon, Canada. It has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1902 to 1949 and since 1953.

The city of Whitehorse comprises an overwhelmingly large portion of the electorate and thus elections are fought on a comparatively small area.

<doc id="630079" wikidata="Q146531" url="?curid=630079" title="1981 Midas">
<text>1981 Midas, provisional designation , is a vestoid asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid, approximately 2 kilometers in diameter.

It was discovered on 6 March 1973 by American astronomer Charles Kowal at Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California. It was named after King Midas from Greek mythology.

== Classification and orbit ==

The moderately bright V-type asteroid is also an Apollo asteroid, as well as a Venus and Mars-crosser. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.6–2.9 AU once every 2 years and 4 months (864 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.65 and an inclination of 40° with respect to the ecliptic.

&quot;Midas&quot; has a low minimum orbit intersection distance with Earth of , which corresponds to 1.5 lunar distance (Earth–Moon distance). However, it does not pose an impact risk for the foreseeable future. On 19 March 1947 it passed from Earth. The last notable close approach was on 21 March 2018 passing from Earth and shining at an apparent magnitude of +12.4. The next notable close approach will be on 14 September 2032 passing slightly closer at from Earth. As no precoveries are known, the asteroid&#x27;s observation arc begins with its discovery observation at Palomar in 1973.

With a semi-major axis of 1.78 AU, when 1 AU from the Sun (and passing Earth&#x27;s orbit) the asteroid is moving at 35.7 km/s with respect to the Sun. For comparison Earth orbits the Sun at 30 km/s.

== Physical characteristics ==

Three rotational lightcurves obtained from photometric observations gave a concurring rotation period of 5.24 hours with a relatively high brightness variation of 0.65, 0.8 and 0.87 in magnitude, respectively ().

According to the survey carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, &quot;Midas&quot; measures 1.95 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.293, while the &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes an albedo of 0.266 and calculates an identical diameter of 1.95 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 15.6.

In 1987, &quot;Midas&quot; was also detected by radar from Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex at a distance of 0.08 AU with a measured maximal radar cross-section of 0.1 km2.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the figure from Greek mythology, Midas, the King of Phrygia, who turned whatever he touched to gold. He received this ability as an award, but soon realized that this gift was a curse when his daughter turned into a statue after he had touched her. Relieved of his power by bathing in the river Pactolus, other accounts also tell his death caused by starvation. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 October 1977 ().

<text>Mahavatar Babaji (; ) is the Himalayan yogi and guru who taught Kriya Yoga to Lahiri Mahasaya (1828–1895). Babaji first became recognized through the writings of Paramahansa Yogananda, who devoted a chapter of his &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; to Babaji and founded Self-Realization Fellowship, a modern yoga movement that Babaji is associated with. The cave where Babaji met Lahiri Mahasaya, located near Ranikhet, is now a tourist attraction and place of pilgrimage in India.

==In popular culture==

Mahavatar Babaji was on the cover of The Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. He can also be seen on the cover of George Harrison&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Dark Horse&quot;. Songwriter Roger Hodgson of English rock band Supertramp composed a song called &quot;Babaji&quot; in reference to Mahavatar Babaji. This song was recorded and released on their 1977 album &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments...&quot; In Book 3 of &quot;Conversations with God&quot; (1998), by Neale Donald Walsch, it is mentioned that Babaji may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, like Jesus.

The 2002 film &quot;Baba&quot; featured a fictional encounter with Mahavatar Babaji. The film was produced by Rajinikanth, a devotee of Babaji.

<text>1982 Cline, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 4 November 1975, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory in California, and named after Edwin Lee Cline, inventor and friend of the discoverer.

== Classification and orbit ==

&quot;Cline&quot; is a stony S-type asteroid that orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,283 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.25 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. As a main-belt asteroid with a perihelion of less than 1.74 AU, it is not far from being a Mars-crosser (1.67 AU). The first precovery was taken at Johannesburg Observatory (Hartbeespoort, 076) in 1957, extending the asteroid&#x27;s observation arc by 18 years prior to its discovery.

== Physical characteristics ==

The body&#x27;s first and only rotational lightcurve of &quot;Cline&quot; was obtained by American astronomer James W. Birnsfield at the Via Capote Observatory , California, in November 2011. It gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.36 in magnitude ().

According to the survey carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the latest data from the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Cline&quot; measures 7.2 and 8.1 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.194 of 0.34, respectively. Previous results by WISE/NEOWISE also gave a diameter of 6.03 and 8.4 kilometers. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 8.18 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.8.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named in memory of Edwin Lee Cline, a friend of the discoverer and a known inventor in the automotive field who &quot;looked to space as the new frontier&quot;. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 April 1977 ().

<text>Vela was the name of a group of reconnaissance satellites developed as the Vela Hotel element of Project Vela by the United States to detect nuclear detonations and monitor Soviet Union compliance with the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty.

Vela started out as a small budget research program in 1959. It ended 26 years later as a successful, cost-effective military space system, which also provided scientific data on natural sources of space radiation. In the 1970s, the nuclear detection mission was taken over by the Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. In the late 1980s, it was augmented by the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. The program is now called the Integrated Operational NuDet (Nuclear Detonation) Detection System (IONDS).

==Deployment==
Twelve satellites were built, six of the Vela Hotel design and six of the Advanced Vela design. The Vela Hotel series was to detect nuclear tests in space, while the Advanced Vela series was to detect not only nuclear explosions in space but also in the atmosphere.

All spacecraft were manufactured by TRW and launched in pairs, either on an Atlas-Agena or Titan III-C boosters. They were placed in orbits of 118,000 km (73,000 miles) to avoid particle radiation trapped in the Van Allen radiation belts. Their apogee was about one-third of the distance to the Moon. The first Vela Hotel pair was launched on 17 October 1963, one week after the Partial Test Ban Treaty went into effect, and the last in 1965. They had a design life of six months, but were only actually shut down after five years. Advanced Vela pairs were launched in 1967, 1969, and 1970. They had a nominal design life of 18 months, later changed to seven years. However, the last satellite to be shut down was Vehicle 9 in 1984, which had been launched in 1969 and had lasted nearly 15 years.

The Vela series began with the launch of Vela 1A and 1B on 17 October 1963, a flight also marking the maiden voyage of the Atlas-Agena SLV-3 vehicle. The second pair of satellites launched on 17 July 1964, and the third on 20 July 1965. The last launch miscarried slightly when one Atlas vernier engine shut down at liftoff, while the other vernier operated at above-normal thrust levels. This resulted in a slightly lower than normal inclination for the satellites, however the mission was carried out successfully. The problem was traced to a malfunction of the vernier LOX poppet valve.

Subsequent Vela satellites were switched to the Titan IIIC booster due to their increased weight and complexity. Three more sets were launched on 28 April 1967, 23 May 1969, and 8 April 1970. The last pair of Vela satellites operated until 1985, when they were finally shut down; the Air Force claimed them to be the world&#x27;s longest operating satellites. They remained in orbit until their orbits decayed at the end of 1992.

==Instruments==

The original Vela satellites were equipped with 12 external X-ray detectors and 18 internal neutron and gamma-ray detectors. They were equipped with solar panels generating 90 watts.

The Advanced Vela satellites were additionally equipped with two non-imaging silicon photodiode sensors called &quot;bhangmeters&quot; which monitored light levels over sub-millisecond intervals. They could determine the location of a nuclear explosion to within about 3,000 miles. Atmospheric nuclear explosions produce a unique signature, often called a &quot;double-humped curve&quot;: a short and intense flash lasting around 1 millisecond, followed by a second much more prolonged and less intense emission of light taking a fraction of a second to several seconds to build up. The effect occurs because the surface of the early fireball is quickly overtaken by the expanding atmospheric shock wave composed of ionised gas. Although it emits a considerable amount of light itself it is opaque and prevents the far brighter fireball from shining through. As the shock wave expands, it cools down becoming more transparent allowing the much hotter and brighter fireball to become visible again.

No &quot;single&quot; natural phenomenon is known to produce this signature, although there was speculation that the Velas could record exceptionally rare natural double events, such as a meteoroid strike on the spacecraft that produces a bright flash or triggering on a lightning superbolt in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, as may have occurred in the Vela incident.

They were also equipped with sensors which could detect the electromagnetic pulse from an atmospheric explosion.

Additional power was required for these instruments, and these larger satellites consumed 120 watts generated from solar panels. Serendipitously, the Vela satellites were the first devices ever to detect cosmic gamma ray bursts.

==Role in discovering gamma-ray bursts==
On 2 July 1967, at 14:19 UTC, the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature. Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, led by Ray Klebesadel, filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen bursts and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. Contrary to popular belief, the data was never classified. After thorough analysis, the findings were published in 1973 as an &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot; article entitled &quot;Observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts of Cosmic Origin&quot;. This alerted the astronomical community to the existence of gamma-ray bursts, now recognised as the most violent events in the universe.

=== Vela 5A and 5B ===
The scintillation X-ray detector (XC) aboard Vela 5A and its twin Vela 5B consisted of two 1 mm thick NaI(Tl) crystals mounted on photomultiplier tubes and covered by a 0.13 mm thick beryllium window. Electronic thresholds provided two energy channels, 3–12 keV and 6–12 keV. In addition to the x-ray Nova announcement indicated above the XC Detector aboard Vela 5A and 5B also discovered and announced the first X-ray burst ever reported. The announcement of this discovery predated the initial announcement of the discovery of gamma-ray bursts by 2 years. In front of each crystal was a slat collimator providing a full width at half maximum (FWHM) aperture of c. 6.1 × 6.1 degrees. The effective detector area was c. 26 cm2. The detectors scanned a great circle every 60 seconds, and covered the whole sky every 56 hours. Sensitivity to celestial sources was severely limited by the high intrinsic detector background, equivalent to about 80% of the signal from the Crab Nebula, one of the brightest sources in the sky at these wavelengths. The Vela 5B satellite X-ray detector remained functional for over ten years.

=== Vela 6A and 6B ===
Like the previous Vela 5 satellites, the Vela 6 nuclear test detection satellites were part of a program run jointly by the Advanced Research Projects of the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, managed by the U.S. Air Force. The twin spacecraft, Vela 6A and 6B, were launched on 8 April 1970. Data from the Vela 6 satellites were used to look for correlations between gamma-ray bursts and X-ray events. At least two good candidates were found, GB720514 and GB740723. The X-ray detectors failed on Vela 6B on 27 January 1972 and on Vela 6A on 12 March 1972.

== Controversial observations ==

Some controversy still surrounds the Vela program. On 22 September 1979 the Vela 5B satellite (also known as Vela 10 and IRON 6911) detected the characteristic double flash of an atmospheric nuclear explosion near the Prince Edward Islands. Still unsatisfactorily explained, this event has become known as the Vela incident. President Jimmy Carter initially deemed the event to be evidence of a joint Israeli and South African nuclear test, though the now-declassified report of a scientific panel he subsequently appointed while seeking reelection concluded that it was probably not the event of a nuclear explosion.
In 2018, a new study confirmed that it is highly likely that it was a nuclear test, conducted by Israel.
An alternative explanation involves a magnetospheric event affecting the instruments. 

An earlier incident occurred when an intense solar storm on 4 August 1972 triggered the system to event mode as if an explosion occurred, but this was quickly resolved by personnel monitoring the data in real-time.

<text>1983 Bok (&quot;prov. designation&quot;: ) is a dark background asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 9 June 1975, by American astronomer Elizabeth Roemer at the Catalina Station of the UA&#x27;s Steward Observatory in Tucson, Arizona, and named for Bart Bok and Priscilla Fairfield Bok. The carbonaceous C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 10.7 hours and measures approximately in diameter.

== Classification and orbit ==

&quot;Bok&quot; orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.4–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,550 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at the Argentinian La Plata Astronomical Observatory in 1950, extending the asteroid&#x27;s observation arc by 25 years prior to its discovery.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the astronomer couple Bart Bok (1906–1983) and Priscilla Fairfield Bok (1896–1975), in recognition for their contribution to astrometry of small Solar System bodies. Both astronomers studied the structure of the southern Milky Way and fostered astronomy in the Southern Hemisphere.

&quot;Bok&quot; was the first numbered discovery made with the Stewart Observatory&#x27;s 90-inch Bok Telescope. The body&#x27;s name was proposed by the discovering astronomer and by Alan C. Gilmore from New Zealand. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 April 1977 ().

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Bok&quot; has been characterized as a C-type asteroid.

In October 2014, the first rotational lightcurve for this body was obtained by Italian astronomer Giovanni Battitsa Casalnuovo at the Eurac Observatory () in Bolzano, Italy. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a relatively high brightness variation of 0.46 magnitude ().

The Italian astronomer also calculated an albedo of 0.06 for its surface and a diameter of kilometers, in agreement with the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer which gave a diameter of 15.7 kilometers and an albedo of 0.034.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes an albedo of 0.10, a compromise value between the stony (0.20) and carbonaceous (0.057) asteroids with a semi-major axis between 2.6 and 2.7 AU, and consequently calculates a much smaller diameter of 10.08 kilometers using an absolute magnitude of 13.1.

<text>KPCC (FM 89.3) – branded LAist 89.3 – is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed in Pasadena, California. KPCC itself is primarily serving Greater Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley; through rebroadcating and translator stations, KPCC&#x27;s programming also reaches the Santa Barbara, Coachella Valley, Palm Springs, and Ventura County, California areas, and part of the Inland Empire area. Owned by Pasadena City College and operated by the American Public Media Group&#x27;s Southern California Public Radio (SCPR), in addition to serving as an affiliate for National Public Radio and Public Radio Exchange, it originates some of its own shows. The studios are located in Pasadena, and the station transmitter is on Mount Wilson. 

, SCPR served &quot;more than 527,000 listeners each week&quot;.
==History==
Pasadena City College has a history in radio back to when it was still Pasadena Junior College, a combined high school and college; in 1934 it began hosting a montly radio show on the Pasadena Presbyterian Church station KPPC (AM). Pasadena City College&#x27;s 75th anniversary history book mentions &quot;an experimental program every Monday night in 1942 on KPCS&quot; named &quot;Presenting Pasadena for Pasadena Preferred&quot;, produced by the PCC Radio Division and the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

Pasadena City College opened a radio studio on December 14, 1947, with a studio classroom, engineering room, work room, and reception room, but no transmitter or broadcast license; the studio instead continued to broadcast its programs over other local radio stations, such as KPPC and KXLA (AM). The college was also active in television from September 1949, using the Pasadena Playhouse, which had its own television department.

The college began its own broadcasts on FM in April 1957 as KPCS, with a transmitter purchased from KWKW. One of the few two-year college stations with an FCC broadcast license, it originally on the air from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., it went to &quot;all day&quot; broadcasting on October 1, 1962. The original callsign of KPCS stood for &quot;Pasadena City Schools&quot;, so the callsign was changed to KPCC at the end of 1971.

During the 1970s and 1980s the station won numerous broadcasting awards. The radio station and television studio were flooded in the 12-day rainstorm that affected Pasadena in 1983.

KPCC&#x27;s transmitter and radio tower moved from the C Building at PCC to a higher-powered facility on Mount Wilson in 1988. In 1993, the studios also moved out of the C Building, where they had been confined to a cramped basement, and into the newly built Shatford Library with the television production studios and Media Center, where the radio studios remained until 2010.
The station expansion, particularly in signal coverage area, led to years of controversy in the 1990s over the station&#x27;s change in focus from Pasadena-area to Los Angeles regional interest. However, by the end of the 1990s, KPCC remained a small, student-operated National Public Radio station with various music programs and a budget of $300,000.

===Southern California Public Radio===
Around 1999 or 2000, Pasadena City College received an offer from Minnesota Public Radio for MPR to form a new branch, Southern California Public Radio (SCPR), to take over operation of KPCC, with PCC continuing to hold the official broadcast license. SCPR is a not-for-profit organization now controlled by American Public Media Group, parent organization of Minnesota Public Radio.

 Under the operation of SCPR, the music and some of the local programming was replaced by network programming. Though there were still internship opportunities for students in technical roles, there were much fewer on-air voice opportunities. In response to this, PCC started an additional, 1 watt, radio station on 88.9 MHz in 1998, which became known as Lancer Radio, and had an Internet audio stream and a website by 2005.
In March 2010, KPCC moved from the Shatford Library to a converted office building on Raymond Avenue in Pasadena, at a cost of $24.5 million, and named the new facilities the Mohn Broadcast Center and Crawford Family Forum.

===LAist===
In February 2018, SCPR, along with the operators of public radio stations WNYC in New York City and WAMU in Washington, D.C., acquired much of the assets of the blog &quot;Gothamist&quot; and its sister sites &quot;LAist&quot; and &quot;DCist&quot;, using donations from two anonymous donors, and with plans to merge LAist into SCPR&#x27;s existing studio operations.

On January 31, 2023, SCPR announced that the radio stations would move away from using &quot;KPCC&quot; as a brand, and adopt the &quot;LAist&quot; name across all its platforms, including the radio stations. The official call letters for the Pasadena radio station remain KPCC after the re-brand. 

== Programming ==
Broadcast programming originating at KPCC includes the L.A.-centric &quot;AirTalk&quot; and film-focused &quot;FilmWeek&quot; with Larry Mantle, &quot;The Loh Down on Science&quot; with Sandra Tsing Loh, and pop culture trivia show &quot;Go Fact Yourself&quot; with J. Keith van Straaten and Helen Hong.

The stations also carry multiple public radio shows from National Public Radio (NPR), the Public Radio Exchange (PRX), and LAist/SCPR&#x27;s sister organization American Public Media (APM).

In 2025, LAist began a news partnership with commercial station KCBS-TV. This allowed for resources to be shared between the two stations. This proved useful during the southern California wildfires that year, as the station simulcast KCBS-TV&#x27;s audio of their wall-to-wall coverage.

=== HD broadcasting ===

KPCC broadcasts over two HD Radio channels:
* HD1 simulcasts the analog feed; and
* HD2 airs alternative rock via a simulcast of KCMP/Minneapolis (branded &quot;The Current&quot;). Both subchannels also stream live on the Internet.

== Repeaters, translators, and boosters ==
KPCC extends its radio programming via full-power satellites KUOR-FM Redlands (89.1 FM), KVLA-FM Coachella (90.3 FM), and KJAI Ojai (89.5 FM), as well as low-power translators KPCC-FM2 West Los Angeles (89.3 FM), KPCC-FM3 West Los Angeles (89.3 FM), K210AD Santa Barbara (89.9 FM) and K227BX Palm Springs (93.3 FM). KUOR is licensed to the University of Redlands, while KVLA and KJAI are licensed to American Public Media Group&#x27;s SCPR.

<doc id="630094" wikidata="Q691942" url="?curid=630094" title="Pisiform bone">
<text>The pisiform bone ( or ), also spelled pisiforme (from the Latin &quot;pisiformis&quot;, pea-shaped), is a small knobbly, sesamoid bone that is found in the wrist. It forms the ulnar border of the carpal tunnel.

==Structure==
The pisiform is a sesamoid bone, with no covering membrane of periosteum. It is the last carpal bone to ossify. The pisiform bone is a small bone found in the proximal row of the wrist (carpus). It is situated where the ulna joins the wrist, within the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.

It only has one side that acts as a joint, articulating with the triquetral bone. It is on a plane anterior to the other carpal bones and is spheroidal in form.

The pisiform bone has four surfaces:
# The &quot;dorsal surface&quot; is smooth and oval, and articulates with the triquetral: this facet approaches the superior, but not the inferior border of the bone.
# The &quot;palmar surface&quot; is rounded and rough, and gives attachment to the transverse carpal ligament, the flexor carpi ulnaris and the abductor digiti quinti.
# The &quot;lateral surface&quot; is rough, and concave.
# The &quot;medial surface&quot;&#x27; is rough and usually convex.

==Etymology==
The etymology derives from the Latin &quot;pīsum&quot; which means &quot;pea&quot; ultimately derived from the Greek &quot;pison&quot; (pea).

==Function==
The pisiform bone is most recognizable as an unassuming palmar projection forming the heel of human hand.

The pisiform bone, along with the hamulus of the hamate, defines the medial boundary of the carpal tunnel because the pisiform body acts as one of the four attachments points of the flexor retinaculum. It also acts as an attachment site for tendons of the abductor digiti minimi and for the flexor carpi ulnaris - the tendon in which it develops. The pisiform is the only carpal bone with insertions and attachments for the abductor digiti minimi and the flexor carpi ulnaris. It is suggested that due to the pisiform&#x27;s surprisingly large range of movement along its articulation surface with the triquetral bone (about 1 cm of movement is allowed), contraction of the flexor carpi ulnaris is necessary for the pisiform to remain stable enough for the abductor digiti minimi to function effectively.

In clinical studies, the pisiform has been removed as treatment for osteoarthritis in the pisotriquetral joint. While some studies came to the conclusion that the pisiform &quot;contributes to the stability of the ulnar column of the wrist&quot;, others suggested that while excision slightly impairs the range of motion of the wrist (especially wrist extension), the forces generated within the wrist are not significantly impacted. Subjects in the latter study did report impaired function after excision when performing heavy lifting and weightbearing activities, but this is suggested to be subjective considering that they did not have to change occupation or their level of activity as a result of the excision.

== Development ==
Compared with other non-human primates, humans have a short pisiform bone. This dramatic size difference is suggested to be the outcome of a lost growth plate in hominins some time between &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;, who has been shown to have an elongated and ape-like pisiform, and &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;, who is suggested to have a pisiform resembling the modern human condition.

It is suggested that the first signs of human pisiform ossification, observed between the ages of 7 and 12, corresponds to the period of secondary pisiform ossification in apes. This can point to a couple different changes in development: either this growth plate loss in humans is also accompanied by a developmental shift in the timing of pisiform formation, or it is the primary center that fails to form in humans and as a result our pisiform is homologous to the epiphysis of other mammalian pisiforms.

Studies looking at the effect of Hox gene knockouts on the formation of the pisiform in mice have suggested that the modification of Hoxa11 or Hoxd11 genes, or the downstream targets they affect, could have acted as the mechanism for the reduction we see in the human pisiform condition.

== Evolution ==
There are several hypotheses that seek to explain why we see pisiform reduction during the course of hominin evolution. Some suggest that the reduction of the pisiform allowed for ulnar deviation and that allowed for greater extension in the human wrist which increased our capacity for throwing. Scholars with this point of view would believe that these anatomical changes would improve the action of clubbing in our hominin ancestors.

Others suggest that the pisiform&#x27;s link with Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 could tie its developmental history to that of the forearm, whose length is determined by Hox gene expression. Within the context of this hypothesis, because modern forearm proportions are not seen until &quot;Homo erectus&quot; at 1.5 million years ago, it is possible that pisiform reduction would have also occurred around this time. Alternatively, the same group suggests that the reduction could be a reflection of independent selection associated with the production and use of stone tools, but changes in pisiform morphology have yet to be studied in relation to their effect on wrist function.

==Other animals==
All other tetrapods have a pisiform, being the most common sesamoid. In mammals and non-human primates, the pisiform is an enlarged and elongated bone that articulates with the distal ulna. In some taxa, the pisiform even articulates with the hammate or radius. In these non-human taxa, the pisiform develops from two ossification centers that are divided by a palmar epiphyseal plate. Because in other mammals, the bone does not follow a typical sesamoid development pattern and can be seen articulating with more than one bone, the pisiform is not a true sesamoid bone.

<text>Redemption is an American progressive metal band based in Los Angeles, currently signed to AFM Records. The band&#x27;s current lineup includes members of several nationalities.

== History ==
=== &quot;Redemption&quot; (2001–2004) ===
The New Jersey–based independent label Sensory Records—associated with many up-and-coming progressive metal bands and responsible for signing Riverside, Delain and Circus Maximus, among others—signed Redemption to a two-record deal including the self-titled debut record which was released in 2003. The band was invited to perform at Progpower USA IV on September 5, 2003, at Center Stage (then called Earthlink Live) in Atlanta, GA. With Versailles now a member but with Rullo being unavailable to perform due to commitments to Symphony X, van Dyk scouted Los Angeles–based progressive metal band Prymary and met drummer Chris Quirarte, bassist James Sherwood and keyboardist Smiley Sean, whom he recruited to perform with the band. As Mythiasin was considered not to be the best fit with the band, van Dyk approached Colorado-based vocalist Corey Brown to perform. Ray Alder made a guest appearance on the one track that he performed on the record.

=== &quot;The Fullness of Time&quot; (2004–2007) ===
Inspired by a song-writing competition that progressive metal legends Dream Theater had through their online presence, van Dyk set about writing new music. With Quirarte and Sherwood, van Dyk recorded an instrumental which was released as one of the winners of the contest to members of Dream Theater&#x27;s fan club at the time. Energized by the experience, van Dyk wrote more music which reflected significant musical growth from the band&#x27;s initial release as well as lyrics that were more contemplative first-person accounts of real life experience instead of the third party storytelling that made up the bulk of the band&#x27;s first record. With the working title of &quot;The Fullness of Time&quot;, the band recorded the music and before they could approach Corey Brown to determine if he would sing on it, Ray Alder said that he felt the material was strong enough to join the band.

The band traveled to Celle, Germany to work with producer Tommy Newton (Conception, Ark, UFO, etc.). &quot;The Fullness of Time&quot; was released in 2005 and was considered a watershed release for the band, marking Redemption as one of the leading progressive metal bands in the US.

=== &quot;The Origins of Ruin&quot; (2006–2007) ===
With its contract with Sensory Records completed, independent label Inside Out (now part of the Century Media Group) signed Redemption to a new three-record contract. As Sherwood had decided to focus on other things, Quirarte enlisted a musical acquaintance of his, Sean Andrews, to play bass on Redemption&#x27;s follow-up record, &quot;The Origins of Ruin.&quot; Newton was brought to Los Angeles where the record was recorded before being released in 2007. The musical core of Alder, van Dyk, Versailles, Andrews and Quirarte represented for nearly a decade a stable group in the band&#x27;s relatively tumultuous lineup.

The band&#x27;s success in the song-writing competition as well as the involvement of Alder brought them to the attention of Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, who invited the band to support Dream Theater in the latter&#x27;s tour of North America in 2007 in support of the record &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot;. Van Dyk, at the time a senior executive with The Walt Disney Company, secured a leave of absence in order to free his schedule for a six-week tour. The band recruited Sean Entrikin of Quirarte&#x27;s other band Prymary to fill in on guitar on several dates that van Dyk was unable to make due to work commitments, and brought in another musical acquaintance of Quirarte&#x27;s, keyboardist Greg Hosharian, to play live keyboards on this tour.

=== &quot;Frozen in the Moment: Live in Atlanta&quot; (2007–2008) ===
The band performed a well-reviewed 75-minute set at Progpower VIII on October 5, 2007, at Center Stage Atlanta in Atlanta, GA. This performance was recorded and released on DVD and audio CD in 2009. It contains a performance of fan favorite &quot;Sapphire&quot; from &quot;The Fullness of Time,&quot; a 16-minute long song that has rarely been performed live due to its length.

Shortly after completing the mix of the live album in 2008, the band recorded its follow-up, &quot;Snowfall on Judgment Day,&quot; with Greg Hosharian recording keys in addition to van Dyk.

=== &quot;Snowfall on Judgment Day&quot; (2008–2010) ===
In October 2008, in the process of a routine physical, van Dyk was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow that at the time had a median life expectancy of three to five years and was largely considered incurable. Undaunted, van Dyk recorded Alder&#x27;s vocals and traveled to Toronto, Canada to record a guest vocal performance from James LaBrie of Dream Theater, before disclosing his illness to his bandmates and telling them of his intent to battle the disease. He took a leave of absence from work and underwent extensive chemotherapy for several months at the Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy at the University of Arkansas, Medical Sciences in Little Rock, Arkansas. With the visionary and aggressive therapy he underwent, he remains in complete remission with an expectation of cure. Van Dyk chronicled his diagnosis and treatment online at his blog as a means of helping others dealing with the disease, and continues to volunteer his time in patient outreach and counseling.

While undergoing chemotherapy, van Dyk composed new music and waited for the mixes for &quot;Snowfall&quot; to come back from Newton. Without van Dyk in the room, the results of the mix diverged from expectation and Newton&#x27;s schedule became impacted and he was unable to continue to work on it. Van Dyk elected to remix the record with noted producer Tommy Hansen and the album was released on October 6, 2009, shortly after van Dyk achieved complete remission. van Dyk returned to Los Angeles and resumed work, as well as finished writing music for the band&#x27;s next release. &quot;Snowfall&quot; is considered one of the highlights of Redemption&#x27;s discography by both the band&#x27;s fans and van Dyk. It contains fan favorites &quot;Black and White World&quot; and &quot;Walls&quot;.

=== &quot;This Mortal Coil&quot; and &quot;Live from the Pit&quot; (2010–2014) ===
Now back in Los Angeles, Redemption teamed up with Grammy Award-winning producer Neil Kernon to complete work on the band&#x27;s next record. Hosharian decided to return his focus to classical music and departed from the band amicably, so van Dyk returned to keyboards. Released in October 2011, &quot;This Mortal Coil&quot; is centered lyrically around the concept of mortality and is influenced—though not to a simply auto-biographical extent—by van Dyk&#x27;s experience with cancer.

The album&#x27;s completion and production was rushed as the band wanted to deliver a record in time for its European tour in October of that year so that there could be a new record to highlight and promote. The resulting production quality reflects the pressured timeline, though the album was recognized as having strong songs and performances. The band also recorded a selection of cover songs released on a bonus CD with the tongue-in-cheek title of &quot;Songs that One Would Not Expect Would be Recorded by a Progressive Metal Band: Album the First&quot;.

The band rehearsed with Hosharian with the intent of him joining them for a brief European tour beginning with a headlining performance at the Progpower Europe festival in Baarlo, Netherlands on October 2, 2011, however he cancelled his participation just a few days before the tour, necessitating the use of backing tracks. The band nevertheless completed the tour successfully and returned to America, taking a hiatus while Alder recorded with Fates Warning. When that was completed, Redemption returned to the Progpower XIII festival in Atlanta to co-heading the first night of the fest on September 14, 2012.

That show was recorded again for release on DVD and audio CD. With its contract with Inside Out now completed, van Dyk partnered with Redemption&#x27;s original label, Sensory Records, to release its second live album and video. The performance was titled &quot;Live from the Pit&quot; (a play on the song title &quot;Dreams from the Pit,&quot; from &quot;This Mortal Coil&quot;) and was released on September 16, 2014.

=== &quot;The Art of Loss&quot; (2014–2016) ===
Redemption signed with famed label Metal Blade and began working on a new record. The songs were written but not yet recorded when, on October 5, 2014, Bernie Versailles suffered an aneurysm and was rushed to the emergency room.

The band stopped all work while Bernie was hospitalized and in an induced coma to give him the best chance of recovery. They monitored his progress and waited out of respect, but when it became apparent that Versailles would be unable to contribute to the record, the band decided to dedicate the album to him and recruit guest guitarists to participate in the recording. The band secured extensive performances from Chris Poland (ex-Megadeth, OHM) and Simone Mularoni (DGM) as well as appearances from John Bush (vocals, Armored Saint and ex-Anthrax), Chris Broderick (ex-Megadeth) and Marty Friedman (also ex-Megadeth).

Desiring a return to the sound of &quot;Snowfall on Judgment Day&quot;, Redemption worked again with Tommy Hansen and released the much-delayed record, titled &quot;The Art of Loss&quot;, on February 26, 2016. The band created its second fully produced song video for the album&#x27;s title track, with Chris Poland appearing in the video.

=== &quot;Long Night&#x27;s Journey into Day&quot; (2016–2018) ===
When the band was to discuss limited touring in support of the record, Alder informed van Dyk that he was compelled to return to Fates Warning on an exclusive basis. The band nevertheless wrote new music and began evaluating potential successors to Alder on vocals. Van Dyk turned to his longtime friend Tom Englund of Sweden&#x27;s Evergrey and played him demos of the new material. After ensuring that Englund&#x27;s schedule would permit him to continue with Evergrey while recording and performing with Redemption, he joined the band and his vocals were recorded for the band&#x27;s follow-up record, &quot;Long Night&#x27;s Journey into Day.&quot; The band turned to Danish producer Jacob Hansen who had worked with Evergrey and many other bands to produce the new record.

With the recording completed and news of Englund&#x27;s involvement confidentially communicated to the organizers of the Progpower USA festival, the band was invited to return to Progpower XIX in 2018 to perform as a co-headliner. As is the tradition, the 2018 festival roster was revealed at the 2017 festival. Van Dyk and Englund traveled to Atlanta where the surprise change in vocalist was revealed in a video message to festival attendees. At this festival, van Dyk was introduced by Englund to Vikram Shankar, a multi-instrumentalist keyboard prodigy who at the time was best known for YouTube recordings of progressive metal and rock songs arranged for piano. Van Dyk, understanding the value of both a live keyboardist as well as a compositional partner, introduced Shankar to Quirarte and Andrews, and Shankar was welcomed to the band.

=== &quot;Progpower XIX&quot; (2018–2020) ===
Due to its complex arrangements and the heavily pre-booked schedule of Jacob Hansen, the record took an unexpectedly long time to produce. During that time, Shankar was able to add some small but creative keyboard parts at the end of the process. The record was released on July 27, 2018. It was preceded by a play-through video of &quot;Indulge in Color&quot; and the band&#x27;s third fully produced video for &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Problem,&quot; directed by Patric Ullaeus, which significantly upped the production value and visual style of the band.

With Shankar and Englund now members, the band asked Simone Mularoni to join them for their Progpower performance and other tour dates. They also invited Ray Alder and Chris Poland to make surprise guest appearances at Progpower XIX, which they co-headlined on September 7, 2018. At this performance, Alder appeared on the song &quot;Threads&quot; from &quot;The Fullness of Time&quot;, and Poland appeared to play &quot;Indulge in Color&quot; and a cover of the Megadeth classic &quot;Peace Sells... But Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; was the first time Poland had performed that song live since leaving Megadeth in 1987. The band&#x27;s Progpower performance was filmed in high definition for release on Blu-ray and standard DVD formats and CD, released as &quot;Alive in Color&quot; on August 28, 2020, via AFM Records.

=== &quot;I Am The Storm&quot; (since 2021) ===
In December 2022, the band announced that their 8th studio album would be titled &quot;I Am The Storm,&quot; and would be released via AFM Records on March 17, 2023. The album was co-produced by van Dyk and Shankar, and mixed and mastered by Simone Mularoni, who also played lead guitars in a guest capacity on the record.

<doc id="630099" wikidata="Q3705329" url="?curid=630099" title="Beam (structure)">
<text>A beam is a structural element that primarily resists loads applied across the beam&#x27;s axis (an element designed to carry a load pushing parallel to its axis would be a strut or column). Its mode of deflection is primarily by bending, as loads produce reaction forces at the beam&#x27;s support points and internal bending moments, shear, stresses, strains, and deflections. Beams are characterized by their manner of support, profile (shape of cross-section), equilibrium conditions, length, and material.

Beams are traditionally descriptions of building or civil engineering structural elements, where the beams are horizontal and carry vertical loads. However, any structure may contain beams, such as automobile frames, aircraft components, machine frames, and other mechanical or structural systems. Any structural element, in any orientation, that primarily resists loads applied laterally across the element&#x27;s axis is a beam.

== Overview ==
Historically a beam is a squared timber, but may also be made of metal, stone, or a combination of wood and metal such as a flitch beam. Beams primarily carry vertical gravitational forces, but they are also used to carry horizontal loads such as those due to earthquake or wind, or in tension to resist rafter thrust (tie beam) or compression (collar beam). The loads carried by a beam are transferred to columns, walls, or girders, then to adjacent structural compression members, and eventually to the ground. In light frame construction, joists may rest on beams.

==Classification based on supports==
In engineering, beams are of several types:

# Simply supported – a beam supported on the ends which are free to rotate and have no moment resistance.
# Fixed or encastré (encastrated) – a beam supported on both ends and restrained from rotation.
# Overhanging – a simple beam extending beyond its support on one end.
# Double overhanging – a simple beam with both ends extending beyond its supports on both ends.
# Continuous – a beam extending over more than two supports.
# Cantilever – a projecting beam fixed only at one end.
# Trussed – a beam strengthened by adding a cable or rod to form a truss.
# Beam on spring supports
# Beam on elastic foundation

==Second moment of area (area moment of inertia)==
In the beam equation, the variable &quot;I&quot; represents the &quot;second moment of area&quot; or &quot;moment of inertia&quot;: it is the sum, along the axis, of &quot;dA&quot;·&quot;r&quot;2, where &quot;r&quot; is the distance from the neutral axis and &quot;dA&quot; is a small patch of area. It measures not only the total area of the beam section, but the square of each patch&#x27;s distance from the axis. A larger value of &quot;I&quot; indicates a stiffer beam, more resistant to bending.

== Stress ==
Loads on a beam induce internal compressive, tensile and shear stresses (assuming no torsion or axial loading). Typically, under gravity loads, the beam bends into a slightly circular arc, with its original length compressed at the top to form an arc of smaller radius, while correspondingly stretched at the bottom to enclose an arc of larger radius in tension. This is known as &quot;sagging&quot;; while a configuration with the top in tension, for example over a support, is known as &quot;hogging&quot;. The axis of the beam retaining its original length, generally halfway between the top and bottom, is under neither compression nor tension, and defines the &quot;neutral axis&quot; (dotted line in the beam figure). 

Above the supports, the beam is exposed to shear stress. There are some reinforced concrete beams in which the concrete is entirely in compression with tensile forces taken by steel tendons. These beams are known as prestressed concrete beams, and are fabricated to produce a compression more than the expected tension under loading conditions. High strength steel tendons are stretched while the beam is cast over them. Then, when the concrete has cured, the tendons are slowly released and the beam is immediately under eccentric axial loads. This eccentric loading creates an internal moment, and, in turn, increases the moment-carrying capacity of the beam. Prestressed beams are commonly used on highway bridges.

The primary tool for structural analysis of beams is the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation. This equation accurately describes the elastic behaviour of slender beams where the cross sectional dimensions are small compared to the length of the beam. For beams that are not slender a different theory needs to be adopted to account for the deformation due to shear forces and, in dynamic cases, the rotary inertia. The beam formulation adopted here is that of Timoshenko and comparative examples can be found in NAFEMS Benchmark Challenge Number 7. Other mathematical methods for determining the deflection of beams include &quot;method of virtual work&quot; and the &quot;slope deflection method&quot;. Engineers are interested in determining deflections because the beam may be in direct contact with a brittle material such as glass. Beam deflections are also minimized for aesthetic reasons. A visibly sagging beam, even if structurally safe, is unsightly and to be avoided. A stiffer beam (high modulus of elasticity and/or one of higher second moment of area) creates less deflection.

Mathematical methods for determining the beam forces (internal forces of the beam and the forces that are imposed on the beam support) include the &quot;moment distribution method&quot;, the force or flexibility method and the direct stiffness method.

==General shapes==
Most beams in reinforced concrete buildings have rectangular cross sections, but a more efficient cross section for a beam is an - or H-shaped section which is typically seen in steel construction. Because of the parallel axis theorem and the fact that most of the material is away from the neutral axis, the second moment of area of the beam increases, which in turn increases the stiffness.

An -beam is only the most efficient shape in one direction of bending: up and down looking at the profile as an &quot;. If the beam is bent side to side, it functions as an &#x27;H&#x27;, where it is less efficient. The most efficient shape for both directions in 2D is a box (a square shell); the most efficient shape for bending in any direction, however, is a cylindrical shell or tube. For unidirectional bending, the -beam or wide flange beam is superior.

Efficiency means that for the same cross sectional area (volume of beam per length) subjected to the same loading conditions, the beam deflects less.

Other shapes, like L-beam (angles), C (channels), T-beam and double-T or tubes, are also used in construction when there are special requirements.

==Walers and struts==
This system provides horizontal bracing for small trenches, ensuring the secure installation of utilities. It&#x27;s specifically designed to work in conjunction with steel trench sheets.

==Thin walled ==
A thin walled beam is a very useful type of beam (structure). The cross section of &quot;thin walled beams&quot; is made up from thin panels connected among themselves to create closed or open cross sections of a beam (structure). Typical closed sections include round, square, and rectangular tubes. Open sections include I-beams, T-beams, L-beams, and so on. Thin walled beams exist because their bending stiffness per unit cross sectional area is much higher than that for solid cross sections such a rod or bar. In this way, stiff beams can be achieved with minimum weight. Thin walled beams are particularly useful when the material is a composite laminate. Pioneer work on composite laminate thin walled beams was done by Librescu.

The torsional stiffness of a beam is greatly influenced by its cross sectional shape. For open sections, such as I sections, warping deflections occur which, if restrained, greatly increase the torsional stiffness.

<doc id="630107" wikidata="Q714219" url="?curid=630107" title="Philippe Verdelot">
<text>Philippe Verdelot (1480 to 1485–1530 to 1540) was a French composer of the Renaissance, who spent most of his life in Italy. He is commonly considered to be the father of the Italian madrigal, and certainly was one of its earliest and most prolific composers; in addition he was prominent in the musical life of Florence during the period after the recapture of the city by the Medici from the followers of Girolamo Savonarola.

==Life==
Verdelot was born in Les Loges, Seine-et-Marne, France. Details of his early life are obscure. He probably came to Italy at an early age, spending the first decade or two of the 16th century at some cities in northern Italy, most likely including Venice. A painting of 1511, described by Vasari but never positively identified, is believed by many musicologists to show Verdelot in Venice with an Italian singer.

Verdelot is known to have been &quot;maestro di cappella &quot; at the Baptisterium San Giovanni in Florence from 1523 to 1525; and he seems also to have been employed at the Cathedral there, from 1523 until 1527. In 1526 he collaborated with Niccolò Machiavelli on a production of Machiavelli&#x27;s famous cynical comedy &quot;La Mandragola&quot;. While the play was written in 1518, the 1526 performance in Florence was dedicated to the Medici pope, Clement VII. Both Machiavelli, expelled from Florence by the Medici, and Verdelot, generally sided with the Florentine Republic against the Medici, but attempted to play the delicate political game of pleasing both sides. The several pieces which Verdelot wrote for Machiavelli&#x27;s play, while called &quot;canzone&quot;, are considered to be the earliest madrigals.

In addition to siding with the Florentine Republic, Verdelot was most likely a supporter of martyred reformer Girolamo Savonarola. This is shown by several of his works: his setting of &quot;In te domine speravi&quot;, based on the psalm which was the subject of that man&#x27;s last writing before he was burned at the stake; and the use of the tune most closely associated with the monk, &quot;Ecce quam bonum&quot;, the song which unified his followers during his final conflict, and which appears in the inner voices in Verdelot&#x27;s motet &quot;Letamini in domino.&quot; 

Verdelot may have been killed in the siege of Florence (1529–1530) or in the simultaneous plague that ravaged the city, since there is no definite evidence that he was alive after 1530. That he was there during the siege has been considered likely on the evidence of one of his motets, composed around that time, &quot;Congregati sunt inimici nostri&quot;. In this work, texts from Ecclesiasticus are woven together with the Antiphon for Peace, &quot;Da pacem Domine&quot;, which is used as a cantus firmus.

Some scholars infer that Verdelot was alive until about 1540, based on some ambiguous references to contemporary events in his works published during the 1530s. Several books of madrigals published in Venice in the late 1530s include his work; one of these books is devoted entirely to him. Possibly he moved to Venice after the siege to escape the notoriously vengeful, and victorious, Medici. He is known to have been dead by 1552, when writer Ortenzo Landi mentioned him as being deceased.

==Music and influence==
Verdelot, along with Costanzo Festa, is considered to be the father of the madrigal, an a cappella vocal form which emerged in the late 1520s from a convergence of several previous musical streams (including the frottola, the canzone, the laude, and also including some influence from the more serious style of the motet).

Verdelot&#x27;s style balances homophonic with imitative textures, rarely using word-painting, which was largely a later development (though a few interesting foreshadowings can be found). Most of his madrigals are for five or six voices.

Verdelot&#x27;s madrigals were hugely popular, as can be inferred from their frequency of reprinting and their wide dissemination throughout Europe in the 16th century. He also composed motets and masses.

<doc id="630109" wikidata="Q1163100" url="?curid=630109" title="Clivia">
<text>Clivia is a genus of monocot flowering plants native to southern Africa. They are from the family Amaryllidaceae, subfamily Amaryllidoideae. Common names are Natal lily or bush lily.

They are herbaceous or evergreen perennial plants, with green, strap-like leaves. Individual flowers are more or less bell-shaped, occurring in umbels on a stalk above the foliage; colors typically range from yellow through orange to red. Many cultivars exist, some with variegated leaf patterns.

==Description==
Species of &quot;Clivia&quot; are found only in South Africa and Eswatini. They are typically forest undergrowth plants, adapted to low light (with the exception of &quot;C. mirabilis&quot; from the Western Cape).

&quot;Clivia&quot; shares common features with the other members of the subfamily Amaryllidoideae. Individual flowers have three sepals and three petals, all very similar (although the sepals are typically narrower than the petals) and collectively called tepals. In &quot;Clivia&quot; the tepals are fused at the base to form a tube, although this may be very short. The flower varies in shape from an open cup to a narrow hanging tube. In the species the flowers are mainly in shades of yellow through orange to red. The flowers are arranged in umbels (i.e. the flower-stalks or pedicels radiate from a single point); each umbel has a long stalk or peduncle. Several bracts subtend the umbels. Each flower has six stamens and an inferior ovary (i.e. one which is below the tepals) made up of three locules. The stamens have long filaments and anthers which are free to move on their filaments. The style is longer than the tepals, ending in a short three-part stigma.

Flowering time varies. Typically &quot;C. miniata&quot;, &quot;C. nobilis&quot; and &quot;C. caulescens&quot; flower in late winter and spring; in cultivation, &quot;C. miniata&quot; has out of season flowers at almost any time. &quot;C. gardenii&quot; and &quot;C. robusta&quot; flower in the autumn. Interspecific hybrids and cultivars can flower at almost any time of the year depending on climate and the flowering pattern of their parent species.

A distinctive feature of &quot;Clivia&quot; – shared with the closely related genus &quot;Cryptostephanus&quot; – is that unlike most species in the subfamily, it does not form bulbs. The long strap-shaped leaves are evergreen and spring from thick branching roots or rhizomes. Like other members of the tribe Haemantheae to which it belongs, &quot;Clivia&quot; fruits are berries. When ripe, they contain large fleshy seeds which are often more than 1 cm in diameter.

==Taxonomy==
It was published by John Lindley in 1828 with &quot;Clivia nobilis&quot; as the type species. It was named in honor of Charlotte Percy (née Clive), Duchess of Northumberland (1787–1866), who was for a time the governess of the future Queen Victoria.

==Evolution and phylogeny==

Six genera have been placed in the tribe Haemantheae; all are found in Africa. Molecular phylogenetic analysis carried out in 2004 showed that the tribe is monophyletic (i.e. it contains all the descendants of a single common ancestor). Four species of &quot;Clivia&quot; were included in the analysis:

The bulbless &quot;Clivia&quot; and &quot;Cryptostephanus&quot; appear to occupy a basal position within the clade. Meerow and Clayton suggest that a forest understorey habitat, associated with the absence of bulbs and the presence of fruits which are berries, may have been a factor in the evolutionary divergence of the Haemantheae clade from the rest of the subfamily Amaryllidoideae.

==Species==

, six species are recognized by the &quot;World Checklist of Selected Plant Families&quot;:
*&quot;Clivia caulescens&quot; 
*&quot;Clivia gardenii&quot; 
*&quot;Clivia miniata&quot; 
*&quot;Clivia mirabilis&quot; 
*&quot;Clivia nobilis&quot; 
*&quot;Clivia robusta&quot; 

&quot;C. mirabilis&quot; was only named in 2000, and &quot;C. robusta&quot; even later, in 2004. Thus older sources frequently state that there are only four or five species.

===Natural hybrids===
*&quot;Clivia&quot; × &quot;nimbicola&quot; = &quot;C. caulescens&quot; × &quot;C. miniata&quot;

==Cultivation==
Of the species, &quot;Clivia miniata&quot; is the most widely cultivated; cultivars with flowers ranging from deep red-orange to pale yellow have been bred by growers. Yellow plants can belong to one of two different groups which breed true for colour, producing seedlings with unpigmented stems and all yellow flowers when mature. When yellows from different groups are crossed, seedlings with pigmented stems occur and the resulting flowers are orange.

&quot;C. miniata&quot;, &quot;C. gardenii&quot;, &quot;C. robusta&quot; and &quot;C. caulescens&quot; seedlings flower after four to five years. &quot;C. nobilis&quot; will flower after seven or eight years. It is reported that &quot;C. mirabilis&quot; also takes about six years to flower.

===Care===
In cultivation, it is recommended that plants are watered regularly in summer, although not overwatered, with a resting period from autumn till late winter, when the plants are kept almost dry at . Plants can be repotted yearly or every other year in all-purpose potting medium or coconut husks.

Propagation is by seed or by offsets removed when repotting. Seeds are sown on the top of moist material in high humidity.

Pests and diseases include scale insects, mealy bug, and rot.

==Toxicity==
Some species of &quot;Clivia&quot;, including &quot;Clivia miniata&quot;, produce small amounts of the alkaloid lycorine. Lycorine is toxic in sufficient quantities, particularly in pets and small children.

<text>An exudate is a fluid released by an organism through pores or a wound, a process known as exuding or exudation. 
&quot;Exudate&quot; is derived from &quot;exude&quot; &#x27;to ooze&#x27; from Latin &#x27;to (ooze out) sweat&#x27; (&#x27; &#x27;out&#x27; and&#x27; &#x27;to sweat&#x27;).

==Medicine==

An exudate is any fluid that filters from the circulatory system into lesions or areas of inflammation. It can be a pus-like or clear fluid. When an injury occurs, leaving skin exposed, it leaks out of the blood vessels and into nearby tissues. The fluid is composed of serum, fibrin, and leukocytes. Exudate may ooze from cuts or from areas of infection or inflammation.

===Types===

* Purulent or suppurative exudate consists of plasma with both active and dead neutrophils, fibrinogen, and necrotic parenchymal cells. This kind of exudate is consistent with more severe infections, and is commonly referred to as pus.
* Fibrinous exudate is composed mainly of fibrinogen and fibrin. It is characteristic of rheumatic carditis, but is seen in all severe injuries such as strep throat and bacterial pneumonia. Fibrinous inflammation is often difficult to resolve due to blood vessels growing into the exudate and filling space that was occupied by fibrin. Often, large amounts of antibiotics are necessary for resolution.
* Catarrhal exudate is seen in the nose and throat and is characterized by a high content of mucus.
* Serous exudate (sometimes classified as serous transudate) is usually seen in mild inflammation, with relatively low protein. Its consistency resembles that of serum, and can usually be seen in certain disease states like tuberculosis. (See below for difference between transudate and exudate)
* Malignant (or cancerous) pleural effusion is effusion where cancer cells are present. It is usually classified as exudate.

Types of exudates: serous, serosanguineous, sanguineous, hemorrhaging and purulent drainage.
*Serous: Clear straw colored liquid that drains from the wound. This is a normal part of the healing process.
*Serosanguineous: Small amount of blood is present in the drainage; it is pink in color due to the presence of red blood cells mixed with serous drainage. This is a normal part of the healing process.
*Sanguineous: This type of drainage contains red blood due to trauma of blood vessels, this may occur while cleaning the wound. Sanguineous drainage is abnormal.
*Hemorrhaging: This type of drainage contains frank blood from a leaking blood vessel. This will require emergency treatment to control the bleed. This type of drainage is abnormal.
*Purulent drainage: This type of drainage is malodorous and can be yellow, gray, or greenish in color. This is an indication of an infection.

===Exudates vs. transudates===

There is an important distinction between transudates and exudates. Transudates are caused by disturbances of hydrostatic or colloid osmotic pressure, not by inflammation. They have a low protein content in comparison to exudates. Medical distinction between transudates and exudates is through the measurement of the specific gravity of extracted fluid. Specific gravity is used to measure the protein content of the fluid. The higher the specific gravity, the greater the likelihood of capillary permeability changes in relation to body cavities. For example, the specific gravity of the transudate is usually less than 1.012 and a protein content of less than 2 g/100 mL (2 g%). Rivalta test may be used to differentiate an exudate from a transudate.
It is not clear if there is a distinction in the difference of transudates and exudates in plants.

==Plant exudates==
Plant exudates include saps, gums, latex, and resin. Sometimes nectar is considered an exudate. Plant seeds exudate a variety of molecules into the spermosphere, and roots exudate into the rhizosphere; these exudates include acids, sugars, polysaccharides and ectoenzymes, and collectively account for 40% of root carbon. Exudation of these compounds has various benefits to the plant and to the microorganisms of the rhizosphere.

<doc id="630115" wikidata="Q1756238" url="?curid=630115" title="Tambu (album)">
<text>Tambu is the ninth studio album by American rock band Toto. It was released in 1995 through Sony Records. &quot;Tambu&quot; has sold 600,000 copies worldwide. It is the band&#x27;s first album to feature Simon Phillips following Jeff Porcaro&#x27;s death in 1992. The album includes the single &quot;I Will Remember&quot;, which failed to chart in the US but became the band&#x27;s first chart hit in the UK since &quot;I Won&#x27;t Hold You Back&quot; twelve years before.

&quot;Tambu&quot; was a nominee for Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical in 1997.

==Reception==
AllMusic&#x27;s review reflected on the album as a major change of direction for Toto, commenting on the anguished and highly vague philosophical lyrics and the focused, bluesy musical style. They found Steve Lukather&#x27;s performance as chief lead vocalist of such quality that it was puzzling why he hadn&#x27;t been given the role earlier, and concluded &quot;You couldn&#x27;t call the result accomplished, but Tambu suggested that Toto was embarked on a new personal and musical journey that might lead in an interesting direction.&quot;

&quot;The Absolute Sound&quot; called the album &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;near-perfect&quot;, saying that it was better than the band&#x27;s previous works.

<doc id="630117" wikidata="Q1175431" url="?curid=630117" title="Gold Coast Airport">
<text>Gold Coast Airport (formerly known as Coolangatta Airport) is a domestic and international Australian airport located at the southern end of the Gold Coast and approximately south of Brisbane, within the South East Queensland agglomeration. The entrance to the airport is situated in the suburb of Bilinga near Coolangatta. The main runway itself cuts through the state borders of Queensland and New South Wales. During summer, these states are in two different time zones. The Gold Coast Airport operates on Queensland Time (year-round AEST / UTC+10).

The facility occupies 371 hectares (917 acres) of airport property.

==History==
Until 1989, the airport was known as &quot;Coolangatta Airport&quot;. This is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;Place of Good View&quot;. It originally consisted (1936) of three grass strips with the intention of only providing an emergency landing ground for airmail aircraft transiting between Brisbane and Sydney. Passenger flights took off for the first time in 1939 using the then grassy field of the current Coolangatta site. Regular services were started by Queensland Airlines and Butler Air Transport after World War II. Ansett started its own services in 1950 using DC-3s, while Trans Australia Airlines did the same in 1954 using DC-3s, too, as well as DC-4s and Convairs to link other Australian cities.

By 1958, the taxiways and runways were fully paved, with the latter upgraded a decade later to allow jet operations with DC-9 and L-188 Electra aircraft to begin. The current terminal, known as the &quot;Eric Robinson Building&quot;, was officially opened in 1981 by Acting Prime Minister Douglas Anthony, when at the time more than 650,000 passengers were using the airport. The following year, the main runway was lengthened to , thus permitting the use of wide-body jets by the two domestic operators Ansett Australia and Trans Australia Airlines and their Boeing 767 and Airbus A300 respectively on flights from Melbourne and Sydney.

From 1 January 1988, the airport was managed by the Federal Airports Corporation on behalf of the Government. A decade later, on 29 May 1998, the airport was privatised via a long-term lease to Queensland Airports (QAL). By 1999 the company&#x27;s name had changed to become Gold Coast Airport Pty Ltd (GCAPL). 
The airport then suffered from the collapse of Ansett in 2001, as Ansett had operated direct services from the Gold Coast to 12 Australian destinations.

In 2003, GCAPL was taken over by QAL, which today also leases and operates Mount Isa Airport, Townsville Airport and Longreach Airport.

Despite the name change from &quot;Coolangatta Airport&quot; to &quot;Gold Coast Airport&quot;, the airport retains its original IATA code, OOL and ICAO code, YBCG. The Airport ownership remains with the Government of Australia.

In 1989, the airport welcomed its first international charter service from New Zealand, and by 1999 Air New Zealand low-cost subsidiary Freedom Air started scheduled no-frills service from Hamilton, New Zealand with Boeing 737s. In 2007 the airport celebrated the arrival of AirAsia X, which began services directly to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Tigerair Australia, which started services to Melbourne. Subsequently, the airport has had flights from Air Pacific from Nadi, Fiji. Jetstar to Tokyo and Osaka. Services to New Zealand increased as well, with Jetstar, Air New Zealand and Pacific Blue flying to Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Airnorth also started services to the airport from Darwin, via Mount Isa. In addition, Virgin Blue announced direct services from Canberra and Townsville. This opened up connections between all three Queensland Airports-owned airports – Mount Isa Airport, Townsville Airport and Gold Coast Airport.

2010 saw Jetstar announce the airport as its newest hub, increased services to Cairns and new direct services to Perth (discontinued in 2013) and Queenstown. Tiger Airways also announced their newest base at Avalon Airport in Geelong, and said that services from Avalon to the Gold Coast would commence later in the year; however, services to Adelaide would be cut due to delays in receiving new aircraft which were intended for their new Avalon base.

On 26 October 2010, Gold Coast Airport was named the 2010 Major Airport of the Year 2010 by the Australian Airports Association (AAA).

The Gold Coast Airport served as the official airport of the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

In July 2023, Scoot Airlines suspended its Gold Coast route indefinitely, citing operational costs, leaving no direct route between the Gold Coast and Singapore.

On 1 August 2023, Bonza announced it would open its third base at Gold Coast Airport, flying on 14 routes, 11 of which are not flown by other airlines. Bonza launched the new routes starting November 2023, but ceased all operations when it declared bankruptcy in April 2024.

In October 2023, Jetstar replaced its Gold Coast to Tokyo route with Brisbane, to better utilize resources.

On 17 July 2024, AirAsia X announced it was ceasing operations to the Gold Coast from 1 December 2024 due to operational costs. Gold Coast airport now has severely limited international connections. 

However, despite numerous international service reductions, Gold Coast Airport will be the most connected Australian airport with New Zealand when, in June 2025, Jetstar will commence flights to Hamilton and Dunedin.

==Infrastructure==


It is anticipated that a railway station will be constructed at the airport if the Gold Coast line is extended. In 2008, the Tugun Bypass opened and featured a tunnel under the runway.

The airport opened an extension to the main runway as well as a full-length parallel taxiway in May 2007. The runway will be long, allowing for heavier aircraft with greater range to takeoff. The final runway was confirmed as long in 2007, as says the plaque and photos of the 2006 runway length of compared to the 2007 runway length of on the left wall of the arrivals southern exit.

On 16 May 2007, the runway extension was officially inaugurated by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport, Mark Vaile.

Gold Coast Airport appointed ADCO Constructions as the principal design and construct contractor for a $100-million redevelopment of the airport&#x27;s main terminal. Completed in 2010, the project doubled the size of the existing facility to almost , incorporating domestic and international operations with self-service kiosks and 40 common-user check-in desks. The works will accommodate forecast growth for the next 10 years with a further expansion, stage two, scheduled to kick in upon demand. The main terminal – Terminal 1 – currently houses operations for Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin Australia, Rex, Air New Zealand and Scoot.

Before moving to the main terminal, Tigerair flights previously operated from a low-cost terminal with basic amenities, located approximately from the main terminal building.

Seair Pacific, a scheduled and charter airline based at Gold Coast Airport, operate from their own hangar in the general aviation part of the airport.

An Instrument Landing System (ILS) was scheduled to be installed at the airport by June 2015 to enable planes to land during adverse weather conditions. It would be a Required navigation performance (RNP) system rather than a traditional ILS as this would allow planes to cross the coast at Currumbin rather than Surfers Paradise and therefore fly over fewer houses. The proposed ILS had become an issue with residents concerned with noise. On 25 January 2016 the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Warren Truss, approved the installation of an ILS at Gold Coast Airport. Due to Ground contamination that was found at the ILS location, it will not be able to be installed before the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games.

=== Terminal expansion ===

2016 saw the commencement of Project LIFT an approximate $300 million upgrade featuring two new wide-bodied aircraft stands and a three-level terminal development with four aerobridges and improved ground transport facilities. It enabled up to 19 additional aircraft to take off and touch down.

In July 2019, work began on the southern terminal expansion. Infrastructure group Lendlease was appointed to deliver the project.

By August 2022, much of the expansion work was complete and 400 volunteers participated in a mass trial at the Gold Coast Airport&#x27;s new terminal on 30 August 2022.

==Lounges==
Gold Coast Airport has two airline lounges: one, operated by Virgin Australia, has been operational since 30 May 2012, and is available to business class passengers, Virgin Australia lounge members, and Velocity Frequent Flyer Gold and Platinum members. A Qantas Club has been operational at the airport as of 3 December 2012, and is available to business class passengers, Qantas Club members, and Qantas Frequent Flyer Gold and Platinum members.

===Road===
The airport is located on the western side of the Gold Coast Highway in Bilinga, the terminal is 300 metres from the highway. The Gold Coast Highway passes through all the coastal suburbs of the city and is the most direct route to most of the major holiday destinations on the Gold Coast.

The Pacific Motorway (M1) interchange is 1.5 km south of the airport just over the NSW border in Tweed Heads West. The Pacific Motorway connects the city to Northern NSW, Gold Coast&#x27;s western suburbs, and Brisbane CBD.

===Public bus===
All bus services are provided by Kinetic Group.
*Route 777 (northbound) – Broadbeach South light rail station via Gold Coast Highway. This service is a limited stop, express service only. From there, passengers can connect to other bus services and the .
*760 (northbound) – Robina Town Centre via Varsity Lakes railway station and The Pines Shopping Centre. 
*Route 760 (north &amp; southbound) – Tweed Heads via Kirra and Coolangatta.

===Airport shuttles===
There are a number of private operators offering transfers between Gold Coast Airport and Brisbane. Scheduled transfers are available for arriving and departing passengers.

===Train===
The Gold Coast City Transport Strategy 2031 includes an extension of the light rail to the airport, while the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program envisions extending the Gold Coast Line train line to the airport. As of 2019, neither have been approved to begin construction.

==Accidents and incidents==

In March 1949, a Lockheed Lodestar aircraft became airborne at Bilinga airstrip for a flight to Archerfield Airport. Before reaching a height of it stalled and crashed. All 21 occupants died in the crash or the ensuing conflagration. It was Queensland&#x27;s worst civil aviation accident.

== Awards ==
Gold Coast Airport received the &quot;best airport award for customer experience&quot; at the 2018 National Airport Industry Awards hosted by the Australian Airports Association in Brisbane.

<doc id="630118" wikidata="Q656944" url="?curid=630118" title="Gonatidae">
<text>The Gonatidae, also known as armhook squid, are a family of moderately sized squid. The family contains about 19 species in three genera, widely distributed and plentiful in cold boreal waters of the Pacific Ocean. At least one species is known from Antarctic waters, and two from the North Atlantic. The genus &quot;Eogonatus&quot; was created for the species known as &quot;Eogonatus tinro&quot; because it did not have hooks on the tentacular club and it has 5 rows of teeth on the radula. Molecular studies in allozymes and mitochondrial DNA have indicated that this species nests within the genus &quot;Gonatus&quot;, although other authorities treat it as a synonym of &quot;Gonatopsis okutanii&quot;.

== Description ==

Morphologically, armhook squid are fairly uniform: all species are characterised by the suckers of their arms, which are arranged in four rows (series) rather than the typical count of two. In most species, the arm&#x27;s two mesial rows of suckers have been modified into hooks and the tentacular clubs—which are covered with many irregular rows of tiny suckers—may possess an enlarged central hook, with or without several smaller hooks. In the magister armhook squid (&quot;Berryteuthis magister&quot;), only the females possess hooks. Species of the genus &quot;Gonatus&quot; differ from the rest of the family (and from most squid) by their lack of tentacles as adults.

Only one species, the fiery armhook squid (&quot;Gonatus pyros&quot;), possesses photophores; these are located on the ventral periphery of the eyes.

Gonatids typically have muscular, cylindrical bodies with very soft, reddish to purplish-brown skin. The arms are thick and capable; the fins vary in shape and size, from and about 50% of the mantle length, to reniform and about 30% of the mantle length. Of moderate size, these squid range in size from 11 to 40 cm—most species are 25 cm or less. Females are somewhat larger than males.

== Life history ==
These squid are pelagic, associated with the continental shelf and may roam as deep as 4,500 m or more, depending on the species. Their habits are poorly studied, but the squid are thought to undertake diel migration; by day, the squid remain in the blackness of the depths in midwater. By night, they ascend to the upper layers of the water column to feed by starlight. One species, however, &quot;Gonatopsis octopedatus&quot;, has curiously recurved arms, suggesting a benthic existence.

Little is known about the reproductive cycle of armhook squid. Most squid species whose reproduction has been observed have been seen to deposit eggs on the sea floor, then leave the eggs to hatch on their own. Five female &quot;Gonatus onyx&quot; squids have been observed in Monterey Canyon dragging a membrane sack containing 2,000 to 3,000 developing eggs. It is uncertain if this behavior extends to other members of the family Gonatidae or if it is particular to this species.

Prey items include both benthic and pelagic species, including smaller fish, such as sculpins and juvenile pollock, crustaceans, including euphausiids and amphipods, and other squid. Cannibalism is also known to occur among the Gonatidae.

Cetaceans are important predators of gonatids; Baird&#x27;s beaked whale, the narwhal, the short-finned pilot whale, Dall&#x27;s porpoise, and sperm whales are all known to feed upon them. Other predators include large seabirds, northern fur seals, elephant seals, and large fish, such as grenadiers, halibut and several species of salmon. In far southern waters, Weddell seals and southern fur seals, as well as several species of albatross and penguin, feed upon &quot;Gonatus antarcticus&quot;.

<doc id="630121" wikidata="Q1813828" url="?curid=630121" title="Oruchuban Ebichu">
<text>is a Japanese manga series by Risa Itō that was published by Futabasha Publishers. It first ran through Shufutoseikatsusha magazine &quot;Giga&amp;chan&quot; beginning in the 1990s, before moving to the &quot;Action Pizazz&quot; publication by Futabasha.

It was later adapted into an anime television series produced by Gainax, but animated by Group TAC. It first aired six eight-minute episodes in 1999 as one-third of the show &quot;Modern Love&#x27;s Silliness&quot;. &quot;Oruchuban&quot; &quot;Ebichu&quot; is very adult in nature, and its comedy, explicit violence, innuendos, and sexual intercourse scenes could only be shown on DirecTV Japan. The uncut version of the series can only be found on DVD. The show is drawn in a simplistic art style.

A sequel series called &quot;Oruchuban Ebichu Chu~&quot; started serialization in the magazine &quot;Manga Action&quot; in 2018. It concluded on October 4, 2022.

==Plot==
Each adventure chronicles the housekeeper female hamster Ebichu, devoted to her oft-indifferent owner, who she calls Goshujin-sama (&quot;Master&quot;) and is only identified as &quot;OL&quot; (&quot;Office Lady&quot;), a single 28-year-old (she is 25 years old in the anime series) who doles out cynical commentary and the occasional beating on the rodent. Such abuse is usually caused by Ebichu&#x27;s almost disturbing lack of tact or propriety, which often embarrasses OL in front of other people. Ebichu is a faithful housekeeper but occasionally carries out a practical joke and also hurts OL&#x27;s feelings.

Ebichu tends to take this in stride with endless praise and compliments of her master. Ebichu often attempts to correct OL&#x27;s bad decisions, such as her berating of OL&#x27;s obnoxious, immature and untrustworthy boyfriend that Ebichu nicknamed &quot;Kaishounachi&quot; (worthless man). Maa-kun and Lady Hanabataki are friends of OL. Some surrounding characters also appear.

==Characters==
: A pet hamster who looks after her owner&#x27;s house. A faithful and versatile housekeeper. She often lacks tact and plays a practical joke on people. She also often embarrasses her owner, usually getting punished as a result. At night, she becomes her secret alter-ego Ebichuman, who goes around giving people sex advice. People around Ebichu simply call her &quot;rat&quot; (nezumi) and usually do not refer to her by name. Ebichu likes camembert cheese and rum raisin ice cream.
: Ebichu&#x27;s owner. Smokes, drinks, longs to be married, and constantly beats Ebichu.
: OL&#x27;s boyfriend. He is lazy, immature, and he likes pachinko. Is constantly cheating on her, but is easily forgiven. He gets easily turned on and off. Ebichu has often discovered him carrying on with other women.
: A soft-spoken man who developed a sexual attraction towards Ebichu, often trying to get his girlfriend to partake in his fetish.
; or 
: A friend of Goshujin-chama and a good housekeeper. She often appears surrounded by flowers, which Ebichu always comments on but the others try to ignore.
: Mother of Goshujin-chama. She worries for her daughter.
; and 
: The newly married couple. They just moved next door to Goshujin-chama and Ebichu in their apartment complex.

===Other characters===
Characters that do not appear on the TV and animated versions.
: A normal mouse and a friend of Ebichu. He is jealous of Ebichu&#x27;s popularity.
: A raccoon whose testicles grow every time he lies.

==Development==
The origin of the anime came about during voice recording sessions for &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. Kotono Mitsuishi, the voice actress for the character of Misato Katsuragi, would read the &quot;Ebichu&quot; manga in between takes and laugh at the humor. She would show others what she was reading and eventually it was decided that the series was worth animating. As a result, she was selected to voice the title character Ebichu. Also, in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, Misato drinks cans of Ebisu-brand beer. In one episode, though, the beer cans are labeled &quot;Ebichu Ichiban&quot; across the top with a small picture of a hamster with one white ear and one brown ear (like Ebichu), although the colors of its ears are on opposite sides (the hamster&#x27;s brown ear is the right one, while Ebichu&#x27;s brown ear is the left).

Ebichu is sometimes joked by fans to be the complete polar opposite of &quot;Hamtaro&quot;, a popular children&#x27;s anime featuring a hamster in more wholesome adventures.

An Ebichu plush toy was available in UFO catchers and can be found on eBay.

The opening theme of the series is , performed by Kotono Mitsuishi. The ending theme, shared with the other shows in the &quot;Modern Love&#x27;s Silliness&quot; block, is by Minami Karasuyama 6th Street Production.

<text>SS &quot;Commissaire Ramel&quot; was a French cargo liner that was launched in 1920 and sunk in the Indian Ocean by the German merchant raider in World War II.

==Ship history==
===Building===
The &quot;Société Provençale de Construction Navale&quot; built the ship in La Ciotat as &quot;General Duchesne&quot;. Before she was launched she was renamed &quot;Commissaire Ramel&quot; in honour of Paul Ramel, the purser of the ship , who was lost when his ship was torpedoed on 11 February 1917, and posthumously awarded the légion d&#x27;honneur.

The ship was long, with a beam of . As built, her tonnages were 16,620 displacement and . She was powered by a three-cylinder triple expansion engine with coal-fired boilers that delivered 4,450 hp, driving a single propeller and giving her a speed of .

===Service history===
&quot;Commissaire Ramel&quot; was launched on 20 March 1920, and entered service with the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes on 24 April 1921, as a cargo liner, sailing between France and the Far East.

In 1926 she was refitted in La Ciotat as an ocean liner, receiving a promenade deck, lifeboat deck, and an additional boiler. This gave her the capacity to carry up to 552 passengers, and increased her tonnages to 20,323 tonnes displacement and 10,092 GRT. The additional boiler increased her power to 5,000 hp, giving her a speed to . On 19 January 1927 she returned to service, sailing between France and Australia.

In 1931 she was refitted again. Her boilers were converted from coal to oil fuel, and a low-pressure steam turbine was added alongside her triple-expansion engine. Exhaust steam from the low-pressure cylinder of her piston engine powered the turbine, which was geared onto the same propeller shaft as her piston engine. The addition of the turbine increased her total power to 6,250 hp.

Until 1933 the ship&#x27;s code letters were OEXC. In 1934 these were superseded by the call sign FOAR.

In 1935 she was transferred to a new route, sailing between Marseille and New Caledonia in the South Pacific, via the Panama Canal. On 19 May 1940 she left Marseille under the command of Captain Sabouret, bound for Tahiti. She arrived at Papeete on 28 June 1940, five days after the signing of armistice between France and Germany that ended the battle of France. On 18 July 1940 she arrived at Suva in Fiji to refuel, but was requisitioned by the authorities there. She was taken to Sydney, Australia, where 26 members of the crew, including the captain, volunteered to serve aboard.

===Sinking===
Under the management of the Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line she sailed from Sydney on 1 September 1940 bound for Britain via Cape Town, under the command of Captain R MacKenzie. Just after midnight on 19 September she was attacked by the commerce raider . After the crew abandoned ship, they were picked up by &quot;Atlantis&quot;, who then finished off the ship, sinking her at position . Three of her crew were killed and 63 taken prisoner.

200 prisoners taken by &quot;Atlantis&quot; from several ships were later transferred to the captured Yugoslavian ship &quot;Durmitor&quot;. The captain of &quot;Durmitor&quot; reported after the war that the cook from &quot;Commissaire Ramel&quot; was employed to cook for the German prize crew and that the captain of &quot;Commissaire Ramel&quot; managed to hide a bottle of poison with which he intended to neutralize the Germans, but after determining the ship&#x27;s course and position, learning about the poor fuel situation from the captain of &quot;Durmitor&quot; and considering the possibility that &quot;Atlantis&quot; might re-appear once the ship was taken over by the prisoners and take revenge, he gave up his plan.

The prisoners were landed at Warsheikh in Italian East Africa on 22 November 1940. They were held in a camp at Merca until liberated by British troops on 25 February 1941 during the East African Campaign. &quot;Durmitor&quot; survived the war and was returned to Yugoslavia.

==Early life==
Krause was born on August 12, 1965, in Alexandria, Minnesota. His parents, Wanda Marie Krause (&quot;née&quot; Johnson) and William Popham &quot;Bill&quot; Krause, were both teachers in Minnesota. He was raised in Roseville, Minnesota, a suburb of St. Paul, and has two siblings, Amy and Michael.

As a teenager, Krause was active in track and field and gymnastics and attended Alexander Ramsey High School in Roseville, Minnesota. He graduated from high school in 1983 and was a pre-medical student at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter until he discovered acting in his junior year and changed his final major to English Literature. In college, he performed in plays such as Paul Sills&#x27; &quot;Story Theatre&quot;, Caryl Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Cloud 9&quot;, and Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot;, which all led to his full commitment to acting. After graduating from college in 1987, Krause moved to New York City and completed a Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from New York University&#x27;s Graduate Acting Program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1990. While in New York City, he worked as a bartender at Broadway&#x27;s Palace Theatre with Aaron Sorkin, who later created and executive produced &quot;Sports Night&quot;, which starred Krause.

While attending Tisch School of the Arts, he starred in productions of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, and &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;. Shortly after graduation, Krause moved to Los Angeles after landing a regular role on Carol Burnett&#x27;s sketch comedy series &quot;Carol &amp; Company&quot;.

==Career==
In 1987, Krause made his first feature film appearance in an American slasher film, &quot;Blood Harvest&quot;. After earning an M.F.A. degree from the New York University Tisch School of the Arts in 1990, he moved to Los Angeles and made his first television appearance, playing various roles in Carol Burnett&#x27;s comedy anthology series &quot;Carol &amp; Company&quot; from 1990 to 1991. In the early 1990s, he appeared in TV shows such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Ellen&quot;. Starting in 1996, Krause appeared in a recurring role as Cybill Shepherd&#x27;s son-in-law Kevin on her sitcom &quot;Cybill&quot; for four seasons.

From 1998 to 2000, Krause also portrayed the character Casey McCall on the ABC network&#x27;s comedy &quot;Sports Night&quot;. Although the show received considerable critical acclaim, it struggled to find an audience and was canceled after two seasons.

Krause starred in the HBO drama series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; from 2001 to 2005. He received seven award nominations (including three Emmy nominations) for his portrayal of funeral director Nate Fisher.

Krause appeared on Broadway in the summer of 2004 in a revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;After the Fall&quot;.

In December 2006, he played the lead role, Detective Joe Miller, in the Sci Fi Channel miniseries &quot;The Lost Room&quot;.

From 2007 to 2009, Krause portrayed young lawyer Nick George in ABC&#x27;s drama &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; alongside veteran actor Donald Sutherland. He had initially turned down the role three times. He also served as a series producer. From 2010 to 2015, he played Adam Braverman in the NBC comedy-drama &quot;Parenthood.&quot; He directed three episodes for the show. Krause appeared in the 2011 fantasy film &quot;Beastly&quot;, based on Alex Flinn&#x27;s 2007 novel of the same name. From 2016 to 2017, he starred opposite Mireille Enos in the ABC crime drama series &quot;The Catch&quot;, produced by Shonda Rhimes.

In August 2017, Krause was cast in the Ryan Murphy-produced drama &quot;9-1-1&quot;, which focuses on the lives of first responders. He plays a fire captain named Bobby Nash and is an executive producer of the series. He is the narrator of &quot;Citizen Hearst&quot;, an Insignia Films documentary about William Randolph Hearst which originally aired as an &quot;American Experience&quot; two-part series on September 27 and 28, 2021.

==Personal life==

Krause and his former girlfriend Christine King have a son, Roman, who was born in 2001. In 2010, Krause began a relationship with actress Lauren Graham. They first met in 1995 when appearing in the sitcom &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;, then became a couple while co-starring on &quot;Parenthood&quot;. In June 2022, it was reported that the couple had ended their relationship in 2021 after 11 years together.

<doc id="630126" wikidata="Q15993250" url="?curid=630126" title="Joey Manley">
<text>Joey Manley (July 1965 – November 7, 2013) was an American LGBT fiction author, web designer, and webcomics publisher. Manley wrote the successful LGBT novel &quot;The Death of Donna-May Dean&quot; in 1992. He moved to San Francisco in 2000 in order to work in web design. Manley was the founder and publisher of the Modern Tales family of webcomics websites, which included Modern Tales, Serializer, Girlamatic, Webcomics Nation, and others. Manley is considered one of the &quot;founding pioneers&quot; of the webcomic movement for creating a then-revolutionary subscription model.

Manley was well-regarded within the webcomic community. He had cultivated hundreds of relationships within webcomic circles and successfully brought webcomic creators together following the dot-com bubble. He returned to creative writing again in the early 2010s, serializing his novel &quot;Snake-Boy Loves Sky Prince: a Gay Superhero Teen Romance&quot; online. Manley died of pneumonia in November 2013 at the age of 48.

==Early career==
Joey Manley was born in Russellville, Alabama in 1965. Though he had drawn comics as a child, he never had an interest in becoming a cartoonist himself. Manley&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;The Death of Donna-May Dean&quot;, was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Griffin in 1992. It tells the story about a young gay man coming of age in Alabama, and was quickly considered a cult classic of LGBT fiction. 27-year old at the time, the pressure to follow his early success up with a second novel overwhelmed Manley. Instead, he began working in the then-new field of web design. In 2000, Manley moved to San Francisco, where he worked for Streaming Media and served as the first webmaster for Free Speech TV. The website he oversaw, freespeech.org, went on to win both a Webby Award and RealNetworks&#x27; Streamers Award.

==Work in webcomics==
To learn more about webcomics and introduce himself to the American webcomic community, Manley began the podcast &quot;Digital Comics Talk&quot; and the review website &quot;Talk About Comics&quot; in 2001. Through his podcast, Manley came into contact with various major webcartoonists of the time. Manley soon began recruiting artists for a for-profit, subscription-based webcomics collective, which he launched in March 2002 as Modern Tales. At the time, Manley hoped the subscription model would increase the visibility of everyone involved in the project, even if each webcomic would have only drawn a niche interest individually. Though Modern Tales never managed to bring a living wage for the artists involved, it did do solid business and got attention from older comic book artists such as Harvey Pekar and Will Eisner. By 2005, Modern Tales had approximately 2,000 members, each paying $3 USD per month. Manley had moved to Louisville, Kentucky at this point in order to cut costs.

Manley started multiple subscription-based webcomic anthology sites in the early-2000s, such as Serializer (featuring high art avant garde webcomics, edited by Tom Hart), Girlamatic (featuring female-focused webcomics, edited by Lea Hernandez), and Graphic Smash (featuring action webcomics). Manley also published single-webcomic subscription sites like Hernandez&#x27; &quot;Rumble Girls&quot; and James Kochalka&#x27;s &quot;American Elf&quot;. In 2003, Manley began co-hosting a podcast with Lea Hernandez titled &quot;The Diva Lea Show&quot;. Manley started Webcomics Nation in 2005, a webcomic hosting service. All his webcomic sites were together referred to as the &quot;Modern Tales family&quot; of websites, and they had featured artists such as Gene Luen Yang, Howard Cruse, Chris Onstad, Shaenon Garrity, and Dylan Meconis.

In collaboration with OnlineComics.net-creator Josh Roberts, Manley started developing a comics-oriented social media and publishing platform titled ComicSpace in 2007. ComicSpace received funding from Michael Angst and Alan Gershenfeld, who set up a new early-stage venture capital firm named E-Line Media. Webcomics Nation, &quot;Talk About Comics&quot;, and OnlineComics.net were all merged into ComicSpace. Manley told &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; in 2007 that his editorial subscription services would remain largely unchanged, though that he was doing away with the subscription model as online advertisement and merchandising were becoming more viable. Despite this, the Modern Tales-family of websites went relatively quiet in the second half of the 2000s, and Manley began relaunching his subscription services within ComicSpace in 2009, starting with Girlamatic. Manley moved to New York City in order to work on the project and was known to be very enthusiastic about it, but ComicSpace never fully took off.

While still working on ComicSpace, Manley moved back to Louisville once again and began focusing on personal creative output through an online fiction workshop with a close circle of writers. In 2011, Manley began serializing a second novel online as a work-in-progress. Titled &quot;Snake-Boy Loves Sky Prince: a Gay Superhero Teen Romance&quot;, the book tells the story of a supervillain&#x27;s minion falling in love with the son of a superhero. All of Manley&#x27;s remaining webcomic services shut down in April 2013.

==Philosophy==

In a 2006 interview with &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, Joey Manley stated that he did not believe that an optimal business model for webcomics exists. Manley stated that he went with subscription models for his early projects because online advertising rates were low and bandwidth was very expensive at the time. Manley felt the need to defend his business model a lot because the subscription model was unpopular among some ideological groups, and he quickly became known as &quot;the subscriptions guy&quot; in his community. However, as advertising revenue increased, Manley began adopting that model more in his services. Manley noted that he would have wanted to get into the print market as well, but was not able to afford it. One year earlier, Manley said: &quot;You&#x27;ll lose a lot less money publishing on the Web than publishing a printed comic.&quot;

In the same interview, Manley spoke about the nature and future of webcomics as a medium. Stating that while people understand that the experience of reading a comic versus reading a webcomic is &quot;sort of analogous,&quot; Manley said that people &quot;come to [the two mediums] with different expectations.&quot; Elaborating, Manley said that &quot;sequential art on the screen kind of serves a different function; maybe right now it&#x27;s a little more disposable, in the way that television for many years was more disposable [than film]. ... Webcomics aren&#x27;t a replacement for what already exists, in the same way that television didn&#x27;t destroy movies.&quot;

== Death ==
On November 7, 2013, Manley died of complications from pneumonia in a hospital in Louisville. Aged 48, he was survived by his spouse Joe Botts.

==Legacy==
Manley received the title of Kentucky Colonel for his entrepreneurial efforts and his free speech advocacy. He was listed by Comixpedia as one of the most influential people in webcomics from 2004 to 2006. Josh Roberts stated that Manley was particularly apt at communicating with people, cultivating hundreds of relationships within the field. Manley&#x27;s death was commemorated by figures such as Scott McCloud, Lea Hernandez, and Joshua Hale Fialkov. Following his death, retailer and convention organizer Chris Butcher called Manley &quot;a true pioneer of webcomics,&quot; and cartoonist T Campbell praised Manley for changing the business model and bringing webcomic creators together when advertisement rates were in freefall.

<text>The Dakelh (pronounced ) or Carrier are a First Nations Indigenous people living a large portion of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada. The Dakelh also call themselves Yinka Dene (&quot;the people on the land&quot;), and the Babine-Witsuwitʼen-speaking bands prefer the equivalent Yinka Whut&#x27;en (&quot;the people on the land&quot;).

The Dakelh people are a First Nations people of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada, for whom Carrier has been a common English name derived from French explorers naming of the people. Dakelh people speak two related languages. One, Babine-Witsuwit&#x27;en is sometimes referred to as Northern Carrier. The other includes what are sometimes referred to as Central Carrier and Southern Carrier. They speak Witsuwitʼen or Babine/Nedut&#x27;en, dialects of the Babine-Witsuwitʼen language which, like its sister Dakelh language, is a part of the Central British Columbia branch of the Northern Athabaskan languages. They belong to the Northern Athabascan or Dene peoples (&quot;Dené&quot; is the common Athabaskan word for &quot;people&quot;).

== Name ==
The autonym of the Dakelh, or Dakelh-ne (ᑕᗸᒡ) translated to “travel upon water”, literately &quot;people who travel by boat early in the morning&quot;, a Synaeresis of &quot;uda ukelh&quot; and &quot;ne&quot;. The suffixes &quot;-xwoten&quot;, “people of” or &quot;-t’en&quot;, “people” to village names or locations to refer to specific groups (for example, Tl’azt’en or Wet’suwet’en).

The Wetʼsuwetʼen (Whutsot&#x27;en, ᗘᙢᗥᐣ, &quot;People of the Wet&#x27;sinkwha/Wa Dzun Kwuh River, i.e. Bulkley River&quot;, lit: &quot;People of the blue and green River&quot;; also known as Western Carrier) and Babine (Nadot&#x27;en) (Nadot&#x27;enne, ᘇᑎᗥᐣ, &quot;Lake Babine People&quot;; also known as Northern Carrier) peoples are a branch of the Dakelh/Carrier people, and have been referred to as the Western Carrier.

==Geography==
Dakelh territories called Keyoh, include the area along Fraser River (&quot;Lhtakoh&quot; – &quot;rivers within one another&quot;) from north of Prince George (&quot;Lheidli&quot; – &quot;confluence&quot;) to south of Quesnel and including the Barkerville-Wells area, the Nechako Country, the areas around Stuart Lake (&quot;Nak&#x27;albun&quot; – &quot;Mount Pope lake&quot;), Trembleur Lake (&quot;Dzinghubun&quot; – &quot;day after lake&quot;), Takla Lake (&quot;Khelhghubun&quot; – &quot;load after lake&quot;), Fraser Lake (&quot;Nadlehbun&quot; – &quot;(fish) run lake&quot;), and Babine Lake, the Bulkley Valley, and the region along the West Road River, west to the Hazelton Mountains and the Kitimat Ranges of the Coast Mountains, including the Kluskus Lakes (&quot;Lhoosk&#x27;uz&quot; – &quot;Rocky Mountain whitefish place&quot;), Ootsa Lake (&quot;Oosa Bunk&#x27;ut&quot; – &quot;bucket lake&quot;), the Quanchus and Fawnie Ranges, and Cheslatta Lake (&quot;Tsetl&#x27;adak Bunk&#x27;ut&quot; – &quot;Peak Rock Lake&quot;).

Dakelh territories are for the most part sub-boreal forest, dotted with numerous lakes. There are numerous rivers, all ultimately draining into the Pacific Ocean, mostly via the Fraser River. The climate is continental, with cold winters during which the rivers and lakes freeze over and a short growing season. The area is hilly, with mountains of modest size. The Rocky Mountains form the eastern boundary of the Dakelh territories, but the Dakelh are not very familiar with the foothills because that area in recent times has been occupied by the Cree (Dushina, ᑐᙘᘇ). Part of the Coast Mountains and Hazelton Mountains fall within Wit&#x27;suwit&#x27;en territory. Farther south, &#x27;Ulkatcho people share the Coast Range with the Coast Salish Nuxalkmc (Bella Coola) and the northern Chilcotin Plateau with Northern Athabaskan speaking strong warrior nation (with political influence from the Similkameen region in the south (of British Columbia), the Pacific coast in the west, and the Rocky Mountains in the east) Tsilhqot&#x27;in (Chilkot&#x27;in, ᗘᙢᗥᐣ).

==Culture==
The traditional Dakelh way of life is based on a seasonal round, with the greatest activity in the summer when berries are gathered and fish caught and preserved. The mainstay of the economy is centered on harvesting activities within each family keyoh (ᗸᘏᑋ, territory, village, trapline) under the leadership of a hereditary chief, known as a Keyoh holder or keyoh-whudachun. Fish, especially the several varieties of salmon, are smoked and stored for the winter in large numbers. Hunting and trapping of deer, caribou, moose, elk, black bear, beaver, and rabbit provided meat, fur for clothing, and bone for tools. Other fur-bearing animals are trapped to some extent, but until the advent of the fur trade, such trapping is a minor activity. With the exception of berries and the sap and cambium of the lodgepole pine, plants play a relatively minor role as food, though the sacredness of plants are appreciated by Dakelh people. The Dakelhe are familiar with and occasionally use a variety of edible plants. Plants are used extensively for medicine. Winter activity is more limited, with some hunting, trapping, and fishing under the ice. Although many Dakelh now have jobs and otherwise participate in the non-traditional economy, fish, game, and berries still constitute a major portion of the diet.

The Dakelh engaged in extensive trade with the coast along trails known as &quot;grease trails&quot;. The items exported consisted primarily of hides, dried meat, and mats of dried berries. Imports consisted of various marine products, the most important of which was &quot;grease&quot;, the oil extracted from eulachons (also known as &quot;candlefish&quot;) by allowing them to rot, adding boiling water, and skimming off the oil. This oil is extremely nutritious and, unlike many other fats, contains desirable fatty acids. Other important imports were smoked eulachons and dried red laver seaweed. &quot;Grease&quot; and smoked eulachons are still considered by many to be delicacies and are prized gifts from visitors from the west. The route by which Sir Alexander MacKenzie and his party reached the Pacific Ocean in 1793 in the first crossing of North America by land was, from the Fraser River westward, a grease trail. Other examples include the Cheslatta Trail and the Nyan Wheti.

===Ethnobotany===
====Plants used in cuisine====
They use the berries of Vaccinium vitis-idaea to make jam.

====Plants used medicinally====
They take a decoction of the entire plant of Viola adunca for stomach pain. The Southern Carrier use a strong decoction of the root of Orthilia as an eyewash.

A full list of their ethnobotany can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/27/, http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/28/, and http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/29/.

==History==

===Salvage archaeology===
In the late 1940s, University of British Columbia professor Charles Edward Borden shifted his attention toward urgent salvage archaeology in Nechako Canyon after learning of the planned Kemano reservoir that would flood the canyon, a large part of Dakelh hunting territory in Tweedsmuir Park. In 1951, he received funding from Alcan and the British Columbia Ministry of Education to undertake salvage archaeology at the &quot;Carrier Indian site&quot;. In 1951, Borden and his protégé, anthropology student Wilson Duff, located over 130 sites of importance to Cheslatta T&#x27;en history. They conducted more intensive investigations prior to the flooding of the area. The damming triggered &quot;devastating changes for First Nations communities whose traditional territories lay in their path, including the destruction of Aboriginal gravesites, territories, livelihoods, and archaeological sites.&quot; In 1957, Alcan opened the spillway gate to Skin&#x27;s Lake, desecrating Cheslatta graves, which came to public attention during the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.

In 1951, Borden began survey and excavation of the site and returned to work there every summer until he retired in 1970. His final article published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1979 was based on excavations of early microblade assemblages at Namu in 1977.

== Language ==
The Carrier people speak the Carrier language, which is endangered.

==Bands==

As an ethnic term, &quot;Carrier&quot; or Dakelh includes speakers of both the Dakelh language proper and its sister language Babine-Witsuwit&#x27;en, both of which are endangered languages.

===Tribal councils===

Seven bands form the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council:
*Burns Lake Indian Band,
*Saik&#x27;uz First Nation,
*Stellat&#x27;en First Nation,
*Tl&#x27;azt&#x27;en Nation,
*Takla Lake First Nation,
*Wet&#x27;suwet&#x27;en First Nation

Four bands belong to the Carrier Chilcotin Tribal Council:
*Kluskus Indian Band
*Nazko Indian Band
*Red Bluff Indian Band
*Ulkatcho Indian Band
*Toosey Indian Band of the Tsilhqot&#x27;in people is also a member of the CCTC

The other bands are independent.

==Synonymy==
In some of the literature Dakelh people are known by the French term &quot;Porteurs&quot;. Another term sometimes seen is &quot;Taculli&quot; along with variant spellings. This is a linguistically naive adaptation of the phonetic notation used by Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice. The first written reference to Dakelh people, in the journal of Sir Alexander MacKenzie, uses the term &quot;Nagailer&quot;.

==Etymology of name==

The received view of the origin of the Sekani name &quot;aɣelne&quot; for the Dakelh, of which the English name is a translation, is that it refers to the distinctive Dakelh mortuary practice in which a widow carried her husband&#x27;s ashes on her back during the period of mourning. One problem for this hypothesis is that there is little evidence of the existence of this custom, the report of which is due to Father Morice. According to Lizette Hall&#x27;s (1992) father, Louie-Billy Prince, who had been Father Morice&#x27;s houseboy and knew him well, Father Morice pestered the Dakelh so persistently on the origin of the name that they finally told him the story about widows carrying ashes to satisfy him. An alternative hypothesis is that it refers to the fact that the Dakelh, unlike the Sekani, participated in trade with the coast, which required packing loads of goods over the Grease Trails.

<text>Histioteuthis is a genus of squid in the family Histioteuthidae. It goes by the common name cock-eyed squid, because in all species the right eye is normal-sized, round, blue and sunken; whereas the left eye is at least twice the diameter of the right eye, tubular, yellow-green, faces upward, and bulges out of the head.

In 2017, researchers at Duke University established that &quot;Histioteuthis&quot; uses its larger eye to see ambient sunlight, and its smaller eye to detect bioluminescence from prey animals.

The name is composed of the Greek &#x27; (, &quot;sail&quot;, a large webbed membrane between six of the arms, in some species) and&#x27; (&quot;squid&quot;).

The genus contains bioluminescent species.

<text>William Royce&quot;Boz&quot;Scaggs (born June 8, 1944) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He was a bandmate of Steve Miller in the Ardells in the early 1960s and a member of the Steve Miller Band from 1967 to 1968.

Scaggs began his solo career in 1969, though he lacked a major hit until his 1976 album, &quot;Silk Degrees&quot;, peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and produced the hit singles &quot;Lido Shuffle&quot; and &quot;Lowdown&quot;. Scaggs produced two more platinum-certified albums in &quot;Down Two Then Left&quot; and &quot;Middle Man&quot;, the latter of which produced the top-40 singles &quot;Breakdown Dead Ahead&quot; and &quot;Jojo&quot;.

After a hiatus for most of the 1980s, he returned to recording and touring in 1988, releasing &quot;Other Roads&quot; and later joining the New York Rock and Soul Revue. Scaggs opened the nightclub Slim&#x27;s, a popular music venue in San Francisco (it closed in 2020). He has continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, with his most recent album being 2018&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Blues&quot;.

Scaggs is credited for helping the formation of Toto. For his 1976 album, &quot;Silk Degrees&quot;, he hand-picked musicians after taking suggestions from several people. These musicians were David Paich, David Hungate and Jeff Porcaro. The three were already friends and had frequently performed together on other albums, such as Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Pretzel Logic.&quot; By going on tour with Scaggs, it solidified the prospect of starting a band. Columbia picked up on this talent by offering the new group a contract &quot;without audition&quot;. Steve Porcaro described this as &quot;a record deal thrown in our laps&quot;. Paich stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure if Toto would have happened as soon, or quite the same way, without &quot;Silk Degrees&quot;.&quot; Their friendship has continued throughout the decades, shown by the varying collaborations and concerts performed together. Paich teamed up once more for Scaggs&#x27; 2001 album, &quot;Dig&quot;, contributing to 6 out of the 11 songs.

==Early life, family and education==
Scaggs was born in Canton, Ohio, the eldest child to Royce and Helen Scaggs. His father was a traveling salesman who had flown in the Army Air Corps during World War II. Their family moved to McAlester, Oklahoma, then to Plano, Texas (at that time a farm town), just north of Dallas. He learned his first instrument, the cello, at age 9. He received a scholarship to attend a private school in Dallas, St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas.

At St. Mark&#x27;s, he met Steve Miller, who helped him to learn the guitar at age 12. A classmate wanted to give Scaggs a &quot;weird&quot; nickname. This started out as &quot;Bosley&quot;, then &quot;Boswell&quot; and &quot;Bosworth&quot;. The name was later shortened to &quot;Boz&quot;.

==Career==
===Early years===
In 1959, he became the vocalist for Steve Miller&#x27;s band, the Marksmen. After graduation in 1962, the pair later attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison together, playing in blues bands like the Ardells and the Fabulous Knight Trains.

Scaggs left school in 1963 to pursue a career in music. He signed up for the Army Reserve and formed a new band, the Wigs with John &quot;Toad&quot; Andrews and Bob Arthur. By 1965, the band joined the burgeoning R&amp;B scene in London. Achieving little success, the group disbanded within a few months. Scaggs traveled throughout Europe, earning money by busking. He arrived in Stockholm, Sweden, where he recorded his first solo debut album, &quot;Boz&quot;, in 1965 with the &quot;Karusell Grammofon AB&quot; label, which failed commercially. He had a brief stint with the band the Other Side with Mac MacLeod and Jack Downing.

Returning to the US, Scaggs promptly headed for the booming psychedelic music center of San Francisco in 1967 after receiving a postcard invitation from Steve Miller to join his band. He appeared on the Steve Miller Band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Children of the Future&quot; and &quot;Sailor&quot; in 1968. He left the band due to different music tastes and tension between himself and Miller at the time. Scaggs secured a solo contract with Atlantic Records in 1968, releasing his second album, &quot;Boz Scaggs&quot;, a year later. It was produced by Jann Wenner (co-founder of the magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;) and features the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section and session guitarist Duane Allman. Despite good reviews, this release achieved only moderate sales. Scaggs briefly hooked up with San Francisco Bay Area band Mother Earth in a supporting role on their second album &quot;Make a Joyful Noise&quot; on guitar and backup vocals.

Scaggs signed with Columbia Records releasing the albums &quot;Moments&quot; in 1971 and &quot;My Time&quot; in 1972. These first Columbia albums were modest sellers. Seeking a new more soulful direction, Columbia brought in former Motown producer Johnny Bristol for Scaggs&#x27; next album, &quot;Slow Dancer&quot; (1974). Although the album only made No. 81 on the US Billboard Album Chart, it subsequently attained gold status, no doubt getting a boost from the huge success of Scaggs&#x27;s next album, &quot;Silk Degrees&quot;.

===1976–1981: the hit years===
In 1976, using session musicians who later formed the band Toto, he recorded &quot;Silk Degrees&quot;, with Joe Wissert on producing duties. The album, which received a Grammy nomination for album of the year and a further nomination for Wissert as Producer of the Year, reached No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 1 in a number of other countries, spawning four hit singles: &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;Lowdown&quot;, &quot;What Can I Say&quot;, and &quot;Lido Shuffle&quot;, as well as the poignant ballad &quot;We&#x27;re All Alone&quot;, which Rita Coolidge (who had performed backing vocals on an earlier Scaggs album) took to the top of the charts in 1977. &quot;Lowdown&quot; sold over one million copies in the US and won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song, which was shared by Scaggs and David Paich. In &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, John Travolta choreographed his dance to &quot;Lowdown&quot;.

In an interview, Travolta states &quot;The Bee Gees weren&#x27;t even involved in the movie in the beginning, I was dancing to Stevie Wonder and Boz Scaggs.&quot; However, Columbia denied the song&#x27;s use as there was another disco movie using &quot;Lowdown&quot; (&quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot;).

A sellout world tour followed. Scaggs was performing at Avery Fisher Hall (now the David Geffen Hall) in New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center during the infamous July 13th New York City blackout in 1977. He was around 15 minutes into the concert when the power went out. Scaggs told the audience to save their ticket stubs as he would do a repeat concert on the Friday night, a few days after. Scaggs performed with Fleetwood Mac for a few concerts between 1976 and 1977.

His follow-up album in 1977 &quot;Down Two Then Left&quot; did not sell as well as &quot;Silk Degrees&quot; and neither of its singles reached the Top 40. For &quot;Down Two Then Left&quot;, Scaggs continued working with Toto and additionally Ray Parker Jr, who later created the Ghostbusters theme song in 1984.

The 1980 album &quot;Middle Man&quot; spawned two top 20 hits, &quot;Breakdown Dead Ahead&quot; (No. 15, Hot 100) and &quot;Jojo&quot; (No. 17, Hot 100); and Scaggs also enjoyed two more top 20 hits in 1980–81, &quot;Look What You&#x27;ve Done to Me&quot;, from the &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; soundtrack, and &quot;Miss Sun&quot;, from a greatest hits set, both reaching No. 14 on the Hot 100. &quot;Miss Sun&quot; was an unreleased Toto demo from 1977 .

===Later career===

Scaggs took a long break from recording as he felt making music had become a &quot;career&quot; and that music had &quot;left him&quot;. He did attempt to make a new album in 1983, but &quot;it didn&#x27;t feel right&quot;. In 1985, he succumbed to feelings of anxiety and felt he had to get a record out as there was &quot;something very big missing&quot; in his life.

Scaggs&#x27; next album, &quot;Other Roads&quot;, did not appear until 1988 due to Columbia rejecting the record as &quot;they didn&#x27;t feel they had a strong hit single&quot;, making Scaggs spend more time perfecting the album. &quot;Heart of Mine&quot;, from &quot;Other Roads&quot;, is Scaggs&#x27; last top-40 hit as of 2018. Also in 1988, he opened the San Francisco nightclub, Slim&#x27;s, and remained an owner of the venue until the club&#x27;s closure in 2020.

In 1992, Scaggs performed at Toto&#x27;s tribute concert for Jeff Porcaro, along with Don Henley, Donald Fagen, Eddie Van Halen, George Harrison, and Michael McDonald.

His next solo release was the album &quot;Some Change&quot; in 1994. He issued &quot;Come On Home&quot;, an album of rhythm and blues, and &quot;My Time: A Boz Scaggs Anthology&quot;, an anthology, in 1997.

In the summer of 1998, Boz toured as the opening act for Stevie Nicks.

After another hiatus from recording, his next album, &quot;Dig&quot;, received good reviews. However, the CD was released on an unfortunate date September 11, 2001. In May 2003, Scaggs released &quot;But Beautiful&quot;, a collection of jazz standards that debuted at number one on the jazz chart. In 2008 he released &quot;Speak Low&quot;, which he described in the liner notes as &quot;a sort of progressive, experimental effort ... along the lines of some of the ideas that Gil Evans explored.&quot; During 2004, he released a DVD and a live 16-track CD &quot;Greatest Hits Live&quot; that was recorded August 2003 at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. Dig was re-released in 2006, with the exception of the song &#x27;Get on the Natch&#x27;.

After a break in recording, he undertook a series of shows across the US in 2008. Two years later he joined Donald Fagen and Michael McDonald for concerts entitled the Dukes of September Rhythm Revue.

His next album &quot;Memphis&quot; was released in March 2013. It was recorded in that Southern American city at the Royal Studios. The album included some of his favorite compositions from other artists. A tour of the United States, Canada and Japan followed the release. Before the year ended, he added live dates across North America and Australia for 2014. In 2015, he released &quot;A Fool to Care&quot;, a compilation of mostly covers, including &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; with Lucinda Williams, and one original blues composition, &quot;Hell to Pay&quot;, performed with Bonnie Raitt. The album rose to number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Blues Album chart and number 54 on the Billboard 200. In 2018, he released &quot;Out of the Blues,&quot; reaching number 1 on the Billboard Top Blues Albums chart.

In February 2024, he made his first post-pandemic visit to Japan, touring for seven shows in five locations throughout the country. From the stage of his Tokyo show, he announced that he would donate the guitars he used for his Japan tour to a charity auction to support the recovery from the 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake which had struck on New Year&#x27;s Day that year.[46]

==Personal life==
Scaggs married his first wife, Donna Carmella Storniola, in 1973. They had two sons, Austin and Oscar. Scaggs and Carmella divorced in 1980 and three and a half years later, Scaggs won joint custody of his sons. Austin is now a music journalist for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Oscar died on December 31, 1998, from a heroin overdose. Carmella died in February 2017.

In 1992, Scaggs married Dominique Gioia. In 1996, they moved to Napa Valley and planted 2.2 acres of Grenache, Mourvedre, Syrah, and Counoise grapes. In 2000 they made their first wine, and in 2006 Scaggs Vineyard was certified organic. In 2016, Scaggs sold his plot to Newfound Wines.

In 2017, the couple&#x27;s house burned down as a result of the Northern California wildfires in October. He and his wife were on tour at the time. He lost everything: vineyard, cars, and sentimental objects such as decades worth of legal pads and cocktail napkins with lyrics on them.

==Awards and nominations==

In 2019, Scaggs was awarded the Texas Medal of Arts.

==Discography==
===With the Steve Miller Band===
===Solo albums===

* While the 1969 self-titled Atlantic album failed to chart upon initial release, it peaked at No. 171 when reissued in 1974. Three years later the album was reissued once again, this time as remixed by Tom Perry at Sound City in Los Angeles in October 1977. This version only bubbled under the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching No. 209, but the remix has been used for most subsequent reissues. In 2015 a 2CD was released combining both the 1969 original version and the 1977 remixed version.

* &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked this album at number 496 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

<text>Casimir Pulaski Day is a local holiday officially observed in Illinois, on the first Monday of March in memory of Casimir Pulaski (March 6, 1745 – October 11, 1779), a Revolutionary War cavalry officer born in Poland as Kazimierz Pułaski. He is praised for his contributions to the U.S. military in the American Revolution and known as &quot;the father of the American cavalry&quot;.

==Description==
Casimir Pulaski Day is celebrated mainly in areas that have large Polish populations, such as Chicago, Bloomington, and Du Bois. The focus of official commemorations of Casimir Pulaski Day in Chicago is at the Polish Museum of America where various city and state officials congregate to pay tribute to Chicago&#x27;s Polish Community.

The city of Chicago celebrated its first official Pulaski Day in 1986. On February 26, 1986, Mayor Harold Washington introduced a resolution to designate the first Monday in March General Casimir Pulaski Day, and the City Council approved. The Chicago Public Library closes in observance of Pulaski Day but Chicago Public Schools remain open. Pulaski Day stopped being a holiday for Chicago Public Schools in 2012 as a way to increase the number of days in the school year, although some Illinois schools still observe the holiday depending on snow days.

This is a separate holiday from the federal observance, General Pulaski Memorial Day, which commemorates Pulaski&#x27;s death from wounds suffered at the Siege of Savannah October 11, 1779.

Illinois enacted a law on September 13, 1977, to celebrate the birthday of Casimir Pulaski and held the first official Pulaski Day celebrations in 1978. The bill was introduced by State Senator Norbert A. Kosinski, a Democrat from Chicago, and signed by Thomas Hynes, President of the Senate, on June 26, 1977. Cook County government offices, the Chicago Public Library, and statewide public and private schools are closed on this holiday.

Wisconsin public schools also observe Casimir Pulaski Day, although they do not close for it. Banks in Illinois may close for the holiday.

Section 118.02 of the Wisconsin Statutes provides that, &quot;...when school is held or, if the day falls on a Saturday or Sunday, on a school day immediately preceding or following the respective day, the day shall be appropriately observed...&quot; The use of &quot;shall&quot; denotes this as a mandatory requirement. Each public school in Wisconsin must observe Casimir Pulaski Day on March 4. How the day is observed — &quot;appropriately&quot; — allows for some discretion among the schools.

Buffalo, New York also acknowledges a &quot;Pulaski Day,&quot; which is held in the middle of July, and is celebrated with an annual parade.

On November 6, 2009, President Barack Obama signed a joint resolution of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives making Pulaski an honorary American citizen, 230 years after his death. He is one of eight people to be granted honorary United States citizenship.

Grand Rapids, Michigan hosts a &quot;Pulaski Days&quot; celebration annually on the first full weekend of October in recognition of General Pulaski and the Polish culture in general.

==In popular culture==

Sufjan Stevens titled a song &quot;Casimir Pulaski Day&quot; on his album &quot;Illinois&quot;. The song interweaves his memories of a friend&#x27;s battle with bone cancer with an account of the holiday as indicated by the lyric: &quot;... in the morning, in the winter shade, on the first of March, on the holiday, I thought I saw you breathing.&quot; 

Big Black, a Chicago-based post-hardcore band active between 1982 and 1987, have a song titled &quot;Kasimir S. Pulaski Day&quot;.

Chicago-based alternative hip-hop artist Kidd Russell titled a song &quot;Pulaski Day&quot; produced by Cisco Adler. The single was released on Pulaski Day 2012, and was featured on the front page of Vevo. The video has a cameo from professional wrestler Colt Cabana. The song is an up-tempo track that features lyrics about Chicago in the summer time ... &quot;North Beach in the summertime, Lake Shore Drive is on my mind, no matter where I go, the city has my soul, Pulaski Day, Pulaski Day, We are going to party like Pulaski Day!&quot;

<doc id="630142" wikidata="Q1728392" url="?curid=630142" title="Transdermal implant">
<text>Transdermal implants, or dermal piercings, are a form of body modification used both in a medical and aesthetic context that, in contrast to subdermal implants, consist of an object placed partially below and partially above the skin, thus implanted &quot;trans&quot;dermal. Two techniques are prevalent using post-like and microdermal implants respectively.

Although the skin around such implants generally heals as if it were a piercing, in the body piercing community, these types of modification are commonly called fairly &quot;heavy&quot; due to the complexity of the procedure, but the potential social implications either. 

==Procedure==
When the procedure is done using a post-like implant, an incision is made a small distance from the site. The skin is then lifted and the implant is passed through. Then, a hole is opened at the site for it to pass through, and it is moved so that the top part fills the hole. The implants used for this are generally small and not textured in any way except rounding.

If a more graphic implant is desired, it is generally done in two parts. First, the base is inserted the same way a single-part would be, except that the base implant is threaded. It may either stick out like a bolt, or be inward like a nut. When this is done, the top half is screwed on. This type is usually done for spikes and/or horns.

In any case, the part of the implant which passes under the skin generally is somewhat large and has holes. The skin will grow into them, making it more permanent.

== Microdermal implants ==

Microdermal implants are a form of body modification which gives the aesthetic appearance of a transdermal implant, without the complications of the much more complicated surgery associated with transdermal implants. Microdermals are single point piercings which are a sort of surface piercing.

Microdermal implants can be placed practically anywhere on the surface of the skin on the body, but are different from conventional piercings in that they are composed of two components: an anchor, which is implanted underneath the skin, with a step protruding from (or flush with) the surface of the surrounding skin, and the changeable jewellery, which is screwed into the threaded hole in the step of the anchor.

They should not be implanted in hands, feet, wrists, collarbones or any area where it is not flat or that is near a joint.

===Procedure===
The procedure is usually performed using a dermal punch or needle. When a dermal piercing is done with a punch, the pouch is made in a different way. When using a needle, the pouch is made by separating the skin. When using a dermal punch, the pouch is made by removing a bit of tissue. A microdermal punch is less painful and therefore commonly used. The process starts by identifying the point of piercing on the sterilized area that will be marked with a surgical marker. The microdermal punch is then used to remove skin tissues. The anchor is then placed under the skin and a piece of jewelry is placed using surgical forceps.

<text>Joubiniteuthis portieri, also known as Joubin&#x27;s squid from the monotypic family Joubiniteuthidae and genus Joubiniteuthis. It is a rare, small squid which occurs in the mesopelagic to bathypelagic zones and which has a worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a distinctive squid having long arms I-III which have numerous small suckers in six rows. Its biology is little known. It is thought that it stays in the depths of the ocean with its arms outstretched, waiting for small animals to ensnare after they have accidentally swum into the arms. This species is named after Louis Joubin, a French zoologist. It is known to reach a mantle length of .

It is the closest relative of the bizarre, famous bigfin squids (genus &quot;Magnapinna&quot;).
The Joubin&#x27;s squid has been sighted most recently by Schmidt Ocean Institute, but was first found at the northwest Hawaiian islands on a 2003 NOAA (National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration) expedition which was first believed to be one of if not the best pieces of footage of the squid in its natural habitat.

<text>The scimitar babblers are birds in the genera &quot;Pomatorhinus&quot; and &quot;Jabouilleia&quot; of the large Old World babbler family of passerines. These are birds of tropical Asia, with the greatest number of species occurring in hills of the Himalayas.

Scimitar babblers are rangy, medium-sized, floppy-tailed land birds with soft fluffy plumage. They have strong legs and are quite terrestrial. This group is not strongly migratory, and most species have short rounded wings, and a weak flight.

Scimitar babblers have long, downward-curved bills, used to work through the leaf litter, which give the group its name. They are typically long tailed, dark brown above, and white or orange-brown below. Many have striking head patterns, with a broad black band through the eye, bordered with white above and below.

Most scimitar babblers are jungle species, difficult to observe in the dense vegetation they prefer, but like other babblers, these are noisy birds, and the characteristic bubbling calls are often the best indication that these birds are present.

As with other babbler species, they frequently occur in groups of up to a dozen, and the rain forest species like Indian scimitar babbler often occur in the mixed feeding flocks typical of tropical Asian jungle.

The genera are: 

* &quot;Pomatorhinus&quot; - 15 species
* &quot;Jabouilleia&quot; - 2 species

<text>The anal wink, anal reflex, perineal reflex, or anocutaneous reflex is the reflexive contraction of the external anal sphincter upon stroking of the skin around the anus.

A noxious or tactile stimulus will cause a wink contraction of the anal sphincter muscles and also flexion. The stimulus is detected by the nociceptors in the perineal skin to the pudendal nerve, where a response is integrated by the spinal cord sacral segments S2-S4.

The absence of this reflex indicates that there is an interruption of the reflex arc, or damage to the spinal cord, which may be in the sensory afferent limb or the motor efferent limb. The synapse between the afferent and efferent limbs occurs in the lowest sacral segments of the spinal cord.

<doc id="630154" wikidata="Q3002392" url="?curid=630154" title="Crazy Legs (dancer)">
<text>Richard Colón (born January 1, 1966), better known by his stage name Crazy Legs, is an American b-boy who was featured in the earliest stories on hip hop dancing to appear in mainstream press, and as president of the Rock Steady Crew brought the form to London and Paris in 1983. Today he is also involved in community outreach, dance instruction, and dance theater productions. He has appearanced in fiction films and documentaries. Crazy Legs is current president of the Rock Steady Crew.

== Career ==
Richard &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; Colón grew up in the Inwood section of Manhattan, New York City, where he was introduced to &quot;breaking&quot; by his older brother when he was nine. He was an original member of the Rock Steady Crew after its foundation in 1979. Dance critic Sally Banes in an April 1981 piece on the form in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; quotes Crazy Legs listing the best dancers extant and documents his accidental invention of the &quot;W&quot; move, in which the dancer sits with his legs double-backed behind him. The next month saw &quot;The New York Times&quot; cover a three-day conference on &quot;Bronx folk culture&quot;. &quot;There is a system of apprentices: a &#x27;Lil&#x27; Crazy Legs with Crazy Legs,&quot; the &quot;Times&quot; reported, &quot;Dance steps are performed solo to an accompaniment called &quot;rapping&quot; - chanting voice and percussion.&quot;

His first film appearance was as himself in Charlie Ahearn&#x27;s independent release &quot;Wild Style&quot; (1982), followed by his featuring in the early documentary on hip hop culture &quot;Style Wars&quot; (PBS, 1983). As a craze for all things hip hop took hold, the 16-year-old Crazy Legs, now President of the Rock Steady Crew, took hip hop dance to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour, with recording artists Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmixer D.ST, graffiti artists Fab 5 Freddie and Futura 2000, and the World Champion Fantastic Four Double Dutch Girls. Appearances in Hollywood films were another consequence: he was a street dancer and, as with &quot;Wild Style&quot;, played himself in the fiction film &quot;Beat Street&quot; (Orion, 1984).

In 1991 he danced in &quot;So! What Happens Now?&quot;, &quot;probably the first hip-hop production on a mainstream dance stage in New York City,&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which reflected that the production proved &quot;street dance is an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz.&quot; The following year came &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; as part of a program at the Lincoln Center which the &quot;Times&quot; called &quot;a turning point in the evolution of urban street dance,&quot; the piece itself being &quot;extraordinarily affecting&quot;. The &quot;jubilantly hyperactive&quot; and &quot;astonishing&quot; &quot;Jam on the Groove&quot; debuted in 1995, and in 1999 Crazy Legs instructed dancers of the Urban Youth Theater for their show &quot;Minotaur&quot;.

Crazy Legs has hosted b-boy contests, appearances at live events, and staging of Rock Steady Crew Anniversaries. He provided voice-overs for the television comedy series &quot;Kung Faux&quot;. He is also a character in the video game &quot;Def Jam Fight For NY&quot;. In 2006 he was invited by the Smithsonian Institution to contribute to a collection for the National Museum of American History. Crazy Legs officially retired from competition as of July 28, 2012 after competing at the Rock Steady Crew&#x27;s 35th Anniversary at The Altman Building in Manhattan, NY.

== Rock Steady Anniversary parties ==

As president of Rock Steady Crew, Crazy Legs and his Backspin Productions hosts and organizes the annual Rock Steady Anniversary, a community event that honors deceased members of the crew and celebrates hip hop culture. The parties feature DJs, breakdancing, MCs, and graffiti artists. The group also holds the annual Celebrity Basketball Tournament during the yearly anniversary celebrations to raise money for the Greenwich Village Youth Council in New York. In 2003, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg proclaimed July 26 to be &quot;Rock Steady Crew Day&quot; in New York City during their 26th Anniversary Celebration at Pier 54. Sportswear company Fila debuted the &quot;Rock Steady Crew 77&quot; sneaker in April 2004.

== Awards ==
As part of the Rock Steady Crew, Crazy Legs won a 1992 Bessie Award for choreography. In 1994 he received the Hip Hop Pioneer Award from The Source. He was presented with the Source Youth Foundation Image Award in 2003. He has also earned the 2003 AARTS Award from the Bay Shore Schools Arts Education Fund and was honored as the National Godfather of the 2003 Jersey City Puerto Rican Day Parade. He was nominated for an MTV Award for Best Choreography for his work with Wyclef Jean. “Jam on the Groove” was nominated for best choreography at the Drama Desk Awards in 1996. His dance program at The POINT CDC for young people in South Bronx garnered him the “New Yorker of the Week” Award from New York 1 News.

<text>The Winston Churchill Range is a mountain range in the central section of the Park Ranges of the Canadian Rockies located in Jasper National Park. The range was named after Sir Winston Churchill, former British prime minister.

The eastern boundary of the range begins on the western side of Sunwapta River from the Jasper and Banff boundary and extends north to Sunwapta Falls. The western boundary of the range is defined by the Athabasca River valley to the east of Warwick Mountain. The valley narrows as it approaches the Continental Divide, and separates Mt. Columbia from Mt. King Edward, the latter of which is not part of the range.

<text>Theodore John Nolan (born April 7, 1958) is an Indigenous Canadian former professional ice hockey player and coach. He played as a left winger in the National Hockey League (NHL) and served as the head coach for the Buffalo Sabres and the Latvia men&#x27;s national team and Poland men&#x27;s national team.

He played three seasons in the NHL for the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins. He also coached the New York Islanders, after serving as assistant coach for one season with the Hartford Whalers. On November 13, 2013, the Buffalo Sabres re-hired Nolan as interim head coach; he remained in the position until April 12, 2015.

==Playing career==
He played left-wing for the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, the Kansas City Red Wings of the Central Hockey League, and the Adirondack Red Wings, Rochester Americans and Baltimore Skipjacks of the American Hockey League. He also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League from early to mid-1980s.

==Coaching career==

===Ontario Hockey League===
Nolan became head coach of the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 1988, as a mid-season replacement and coached there until the end of the 1994 season. Nolan led the Greyhounds to the three consecutive Memorial Cup tournament berths, winning the Canadian national junior championship in 1993.

===Buffalo Sabres (1995–1997)===
Nolan was hired as an assistant coach by the Hartford Whalers prior to the 1994–95 NHL season. After one season in Hartford, he accepted the position of head coach with the NHL&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres. In his second season in Buffalo, he led the team to the Northeast Division title and was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league&#x27;s top coach.

His relationships with all-star goaltender Dominik Hašek and general manager John Muckler, however, were strained. Hašek, who sided with Muckler, stated in an interview during 1997 NHL Awards Ceremony that &quot;it would be better for me if he (Nolan) did not return.&quot; Muckler, who had just been voted the NHL&#x27;s 1996–97 Executive of the Year, was the first casualty of this toxic situation and was fired prior to the 1997–98 season. New general manager Darcy Regier was given the option of choosing his own coach. Rather than fire Nolan, whose two-year contract had just expired, Regier offered him a one-year extension, reportedly for $500,000. After winning Coach of the Year honors, Nolan found the offer insulting and rejected it. Regier subsequently pulled the contract off the table and hired Lindy Ruff as the Sabres&#x27; new head coach.

===Post-Sabres career===
Following his departure from Buffalo, Nolan was offered NHL coaching jobs in 1997 by the Tampa Bay Lightning (head coach) and in 1998 by the New York Islanders (assistant coach). Nolan declined both offers. Nolan was not offered an NHL coaching job again until May 2006, a span of eight years, with reports of his role in the firing of Sabres&#x27; GM John Muckler being the reason no team would hire him.

On December 16, 2005, Nolan was the victim of racial harassment during a Wildcats road game against the Chicoutimi Saguenéens. Fans in the stands shouted racial slurs at him and directed gestures such as the &quot;tomahawk chop&quot; and shooting a bow and arrow towards him as he stood behind the Moncton bench. The incident, he said later, left him shaking with anger and humiliation. The fans&#x27; behavior was condemned both by the QMJHL commissioner and Saguenéens management, the latter of which issued a formal apology to Nolan. 

Nolan&#x27;s Wildcats reached the 2006 Memorial Cup final only to lose to the Quebec Remparts.

===New York Islanders (2006–2008)===
On June 8, 2006, New York Islanders&#x27; owner Charles Wang dismissed interim coach Brad Shaw and announced the hiring of Nolan as the team&#x27;s new head coach. &quot;New York Post&quot; hockey columnist Larry Brooks quickly criticized Wang for hiring Nolan at the same time as new general manager Neil Smith, rather than allowing Smith to hire a coach of his own choosing.

In his first season with the Islanders in 2006–07, he led the team to a 92-point season and its first playoff berth since 2003–04. On April 20, 2007, Nolan&#x27;s Islanders fell in five games to his former team, the top-seeded Buffalo Sabres.

In his second season, Nolan led the Islanders to a record of 35–38–9 for 79 points. On July 14, 2008, he was fired by then-Islanders&#x27; general manager Garth Snow.

===Rochester Americans (2009–2011)===
On July 2, 2009, Nolan agreed to a one-year contract with the Rochester Americans to become their Vice President of Hockey Operations. He remained with the team through 2011, when the team was sold to Terrence Pegula.

===Latvia men&#x27;s national team (2011–2013)===
On August 3, 2011, Latvian Ice Hockey Federation announced that Nolan agreed to become the head coach of Latvia men&#x27;s national ice hockey team. He coached Latvia at the 2012 and 2013 IIHF World Championships, finishing 10th and 11th respectively. In 2013, Latvia qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympics with Nolan behind the bench.

At the Winter Olympics, Latvia finished last in its group during the round robin tournament. They then upset favoured Switzerland in the qualification playoffs 3–1. Advancing to the quarterfinals, Latvia lost a hard-fought match to defending Olympic champions Canada 2–1. It was Latvia&#x27;s best-ever Olympic result as they finished eighth overall.

===Return to Buffalo (2013–2015)===
On November 13, 2013, Nolan returned to the Buffalo Sabres, being named the interim head coach following the firing of both head coach Ron Rolston and general manager Darcy Regier. Nolan was hired by Pat LaFontaine, who had also joined the team as president of hockey operations before resigning three months later.

Despite a relatively poor on-ice record, Tim Murray, Regier&#x27;s replacement as general manager, expressed interest in keeping Nolan as permanent head coach. Nolan signed a three-year contract extension on March 31, 2014. However, on April 12, 2015, Murray fired Nolan and his assistants, citing a last place finish and a &quot;decent&quot; but not &quot;great&quot; working relationship with Nolan.

===Poland men&#x27;s national team (2017–2018)===
Nolan started coaching the Polish national team in 2017. The team played in the 2018 IIHF World Championship Division I A and were relegated to Division I B. He resigned shortly thereafter.

==Personal life==
Nolan and his wife have two sons who played in the NHL, Brandon and Jordan.

Nolan is a member of the Ojibwe Nation, a First Nations people. He was raised with 11 siblings in poverty on the Garden River reserve near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The house had no electricity or running water. At age 14 his father, Stan, died of heart failure, and his mother, Rose, was killed by a drunk driver when he was 24.

==Philanthropy==
The Ted Nolan Foundation was established by Nolan in 2004. The foundation is dedicated to supporting the educational and athletic aspirations of female First Nations students through the Rose Nolan Memorial Scholarship. Named in honour of his mother, the scholarship provides $5,000 annually to recipients who demonstrate academic achievement, athletic involvement, and strong community engagement.

3|NOLANS First Nation Hockey School was founded in 2013 by Nolan, alongside his sons. This initiative offers a five-day ice hockey skills camp aimed at boys and girls aged 7 to 15. The program focuses on enhancing hockey abilities among First Nations youth and emphasizes the importance of active, healthy living. Beyond sports skills, the camp encourages participants to become positive role models in their communities.

==Awards and honours==
Nolan was chosen as a role model in the national native alcohol drug and abuse program in 1986. Nolan was also chosen for the Kiwanis Citizen of the year in 1991, and is an active member of the Aboriginal community.

* Jack Adams Award winner – 1996–97

<doc id="630159" wikidata="Q5634356" url="?curid=630159" title="HMS Sluys (D60)">
<text>HMS &quot;Sluys&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named in honour of the Battle of Sluys which occurred in 1340 during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and which resulted in a decisive English victory over a French fleet. &quot;Sluys&quot; was built by Cammell Laird of Birkenhead. She was launched on 28 February 1945 and commissioned on 30 September 1946. In 1967, the ship was transferred to Pahlavi Iran and renamed &quot;Artemiz&quot;. In 1985, the ship was renamed again, this time &quot;Damavand&quot;.

==Royal Navy service==
Upon commission, &quot;Sluys&quot; joined the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet, which was based in the UK. In 1947, &quot;Sluys&quot;, along with her sister ship , escorted the aircraft carrier , which was flying the flag of the First Sea Lord, to Norway, where the small group made a variety of fly-the-flag visits to ports, as well as performing other duties.

In 1953, &quot;Sluys&quot; was decommissioned and subsequently placed in Reserve.

==Transfer and sale to Iran==

&quot;Sluys&quot; was sold to Pahlavi Iran in 1967 after a major rebuild by Vosper Thornycroft of Southampton that took three years to complete, completely changing her outline. This resulted in the ship having a fully enclosed bridge and a revised anti-aircraft fit of four single 40mm Bofors guns and a quadruple Sea Cat missile system. A new plated mainmast carried a Plessey AWS 1 long range search radar. The sale was made despite stresses between the UK and Iran during the 1960s, which were centred on tensions and disputes in the Middle East. &quot;Sluys&quot; was renamed &quot;Artemiz&quot; upon joining the Iranian Navy. After some time, the ship was awarded the pennant number 51.

On 30 November 1971, &quot;Artemiz&quot; took part in the Iranian occupation of the Tunb islands in the Strait of Hormuz. In 1975-76, &quot;Artemiz&quot; underwent another refit, this time taking place at Cape Town, South Africa. The destroyer received four Standard missile launchers with a launch capability of eight missiles.

In 1985 &quot;Artemiz&quot; underwent a further refit, this time carried out by the Russians and received, amongst other things, a brand new Russian surface-to-air missile system to replace the British Sea Cat. However, she did keep her original 4.5-inch Mk 4 turrets, albeit with an updated radar and fire control system. The ship was then renamed &quot;Damavand&quot; and also received two Soviet-made twin 23 mm/80 anti-aircraft guns.

&quot;Damavand&quot; was stricken around 1996

<text>The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory is a book by Brian Greene published in 1999, which introduces string and superstring theory, and provides a comprehensive though non-technical assessment of the theory and some of its shortcomings. In 2000, it won the Royal Society Prize for Science Books and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. A new edition was released in 2003, with an updated preface.

==Table of contents==
* Preface (with an additional preface to the 2003 edition)
* Part I: The Edge of Knowledge
* Part II: The Dilemma of Space, Time, and the Quanta
* Part III: The Cosmic Symphony
* Part IV: String Theory and the Fabric of Spacetime
* Part V: Unification in the Twenty-First Century

==Contents==
Beginning with a brief consideration of classical physics, which concentrates on the major conflicts in physics, Greene establishes a historical context for string theory as a necessary means of integrating the probabilistic world of the standard model of particle physics and the deterministic Newtonian physics of the macroscopic world. Greene discusses the essential problem facing modern physics: the unification of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Greene suggests that string theory is the solution to these two conflicting approaches. Greene frequently uses analogies and thought experiments to provide a means for the layman to come to terms with the theory which has the potential to create a unified theory of physics.

==Reception==
According to George Johson&#x27;s review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
John H. Schwarz wrote:
==Adaptations==
&quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; was adapted into an Emmy Award-winning three-hour program in three parts for television broadcast by David Hickman in late 2003 on the PBS series &quot;NOVA&quot;.

* Einstein&#x27;s Dream
* String&#x27;s The Thing
* Welcome To The 11th Dimension

&quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; was also interpreted by choreographer Karole Armitage, of Armitage Gone! Dance, in New York City. A performance of the work-in-progress formed part of the inaugural World Science Festival.

<text>The AMC AMX is a two-seat GT-style muscle car produced by American Motors Corporation from 1968 through 1970. As one of just two American-built two-seaters, the AMX was in direct competition with the one-inch (2.5 cm) longer wheelbase Chevrolet Corvette, for substantially less money. It was based on the new-for-1968 Javelin, but with a shorter wheelbase and deletion of the rear seat. In addition, the AMX&#x27;s rear quarter windows remained fixed, making it a coupe, while the Javelin was a true two-door hardtop.

Fitted with the standard high-compression or optional or AMC V8 engine, the AMX offered sporty performance at an affordable price. Despite this value and enthusiastic initial reception by automotive media and enthusiasts, sales never thrived. However, the automaker&#x27;s larger objectives to refocus AMC&#x27;s image on performance and to bring younger customers into its dealer showrooms were achieved. After three model years, the two-seat version was discontinued.

The AMX&#x27;s signature badging was transferred to a high-performance version of its four-seat sibling, the Javelin, from the 1971 to 1974 model years. American Motors capitalized on the respected reputation of the original two-seat AMXs by reviving the model designation for performance-equipped coupe versions of the compact Hornet in 1977, Concord in 1978, and the subcompact Spirit in 1979 and 1980.

==Origin==

The AMX name originates from the &quot;&quot;A&quot;merican &quot;M&quot;otors e&quot;x&quot;perimental&quot; code used on a concept vehicle and then on two prototypes shown on the company&#x27;s &quot;Project IV&quot; automobile show tour in 1966. One was a fiberglass two-seat &quot;AMX&quot;, and the other was a four-seat &quot;AMX II&quot;. These radically styled offerings reflected the company&#x27;s strategy to shed its &quot;economy car&quot; image and appeal to a more youthful, performance-oriented market.

The original AMX full-scale models were developed in 1965 by AMC&#x27;s advanced styling studios under the direction of Charles Mashigan. The two-seat AMX was a &quot;big hit on the auto show circuit in 1966&quot; and featured a rumble seat that opened out from the rear decklid for extra passengers called a &quot;Ramble&quot; seat. AMC executives saw the opportunity to change consumers&#x27; perceptions of the automaker from Romney&#x27;s economy car image to the realities of the new marketplace interested in sporty, performance-oriented vehicles. Robert B. Evans requested a car like the AMX to be put into production quickly.

Two simultaneous development programs emerged for a production car: a modified Javelin and another for a completely new vehicle bodied in fiberglass. The first approach was selected to allow AMC to use its existing technology and unibody manufacturing expertise to make relatively inexpensive modifications to the Javelin, approximating the prototype&#x27;s styling and proportions. The automaker could turn out steel bodies in large numbers, so it rejected developing plastic (or fiberglass) bodies because those are intended only for low-production models. The first fully operational unit debuted as part of AMC&#x27;s AMX project in 1966. The once-&quot;frumpy&quot; automaker jumped on the &quot;pony car bandwagon&quot; with its &quot;attractive Javelin&quot; and soon introduced the &quot;unique&quot; AMX featuring a design where &quot;hoods didn&#x27;t come any longer, nor decks any shorter&quot;.

Vic Raviolo, previously responsible for the Lincolns that raced in the Carrera Panamericana during the 1950s, was involved with engineering AMC&#x27;s new sports-car-type coupe. The AMX was the first steel-bodied, two-seat American performance car since the 1955 through 1957 Ford Thunderbird. Ford&#x27;s original two-seater evolved into a four-seat personal luxury car starting in 1958.

The AMX was also the only mass-produced, domestic two-seater to share the market with Chevrolet&#x27;s Corvette since the 1957 Thunderbird. With a short, , wheelbase, the AMX&#x27;s direct competition was the one-inch longer ( Chevrolet Corvette. The AMX&#x27;s manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price (MSRP) was US$3,245 (US$ in dollars ), nearly 25% below and over $1,000 less than the Corvette&#x27;s price tag.

The AMX was introduced to the press at the Daytona International Speedway on 15 February 1968, just over four months after the Javelin went on sale. In the demonstrations on the race track, the new AMXs ran at speeds up to . American Motors&#x27; group vice president, Vic Raviolo, described the AMX as &quot;the Walter Mitty Ferrari&quot;. The AMX was designed to &quot;appeal to both muscle car and sports car enthusiasts, two camps that rarely acknowledged each other&#x27;s existences.&quot; The problem was the &quot;tire-melting&quot; acceleration of the two-seater made it &quot;a quick car that handled like a sports car, confusing the buying public.&quot; Automotive journalist Tom McCahill summed up, &quot;the AMX is the hottest thing to ever come out of Wisconsin and ... you can whip through corners and real hard bends better than with many out-and-out sports cars.&quot;

==Record-breaking==
To promote the new car, AMC&#x27;s manager for performance activities, Carl Chakmakian, asked world land speed record holder Craig Breedlove to put the AMX through its paces before the new vehicles were even available for sale. In January 1968, two specially-prepared AMXs set 106 world speed and endurance records at Goodyear&#x27;s track in Texas driven by Breedlove, his wife Lee, and Ron Dykes. Breedlove&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of America&quot; crew and Traco Engineering had six weeks to prepare the cars before they were to be displayed at the Chicago Auto Show in February.

The AMC V8 engines, such as the engine in one car was bored out to and the in the other to . The shop installed exhaust headers, eight-quart oil pans, oil coolers, hi-rise intake manifolds, racing camshafts with solid lifters and stronger springs, and larger carburetors. The cars had engine and rear-end oil coolers, as well as cell-type safety fuel tanks. Engine components were X-rayed and Magnafluxed to check for cracks, as were chassis components.

Chassis preparation included heavy-duty front and rear springs (part of the factory&#x27;s optional handling package), rear spring traction control arms, heavy-duty shock absorbers, and a &quot;panhard&quot; type track bar in the rear to eliminate side sway. Wide magnesium racing wheels and Goodyear racing tires replaced the stock road wheels and standard tires. The cars were aerodynamically modified: the front ends were lowered, the hoods were slanted down, and spoilers were installed below the front bumpers. The car interiors had structure-stiffening roll cages for driver protection, a stock bucket seat modified for additional support, and supplementary engine-monitoring instruments.

Breedlove also took the AMX to Bonneville reaching in a United States Auto Club (USAC) sanctioned run, as well as an unofficial run of over .

==Industry firsts==
The AMX was not only sporty and attractive, but it introduced many industry firsts.

The American Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) named the AMX as the &quot;best-engineered car of the year&quot; in 1969 and 1970.

For its first-year recognition, the reasons cited included the car&#x27;s dashboard, which was injection-molded in one piece &quot;for safety purposes, an industry first.&quot; The AMX&#x27;s new engine was developed to have a large displacement within its minimal external dimensions and moderate weight, while the use of common components and machining with AMC&#x27;s 290 and 343 engines assured manufacturing economy. The 1968 models also included an innovative fiberglass safety padding, a &quot;plastic&quot; on the inside of the windshield posts that was first used on the AMC Javelins.

For the following year&#x27;s award, the SAE recognition included the 1970 AMXs (and Javelins) being the first production cars to use windshields that were safer, thinner, and lighter than ordinary laminated glass. Developed by Corning, the glass featured a chemically hardened layer designed to give under impact and crumble into small granules to reduce injuries. The inner layer has &quot;stress raisers that will cause it to break before excessively high concussion forces can be developed in the occupant&#x27;s skull.&quot;

American Motors also incorporated new designs for windshield sealing for the 1970 models and developed a systems solutions process that began in the styling studio to ensure maximum efficiency.

==1968==


American Motors promoted the mid-model year launch of the AMX to automotive journalists at Daytona to emphasize its sports car performance, as well as with a marketing agreement with Playboy Enterprises. To introduce the AMX to its dealers, AMC held meetings at nine Playboy Clubs.

The AMX was introduced to the public on 24 February 1968, five months after the Javelin and other 1968 AMC cars. The AMX was promoted as &quot;the only American sports car that costs less than $3500&quot;. American Motors advertisements also showed &quot;a helmeted race driver revving up at the starting line in one of AMC&#x27;s sporty AMX models, which it describes as &quot;ready to do 125 miles an hour&quot;.&quot;

The two-seat AMX was &quot;meant for a small, well-defined market niche, and it pulled young people into AMC dealer showrooms in never before seen numbers&quot;. Numerous road tests described the new AMX as a &quot;handsome two-seater with American-style acceleration and European-style handling&quot;. Journalists gave it a real run workout on all kinds of terrain and wrote &quot;that the AMX is one of the best-looking cars – if not the best-looking car – made in the U.S.A.&quot;

All AMXs came with four-barrel carbureted small block AMC V8 engines in several versions: (, N-code), (, T-code), as well as the &quot;AMX&quot; featuring with of torque (X-code). All are derived from the same external size block. However, the three engines differed vastly internally, with the smallest engine having small intake and exhaust valves, thin block webbing, and a cast nodular iron crankshaft; the 343 used larger valves with a thicker block webbing; and the 390 moved up to a forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods, as well as larger rod bearings, compared to in the smaller two versions.

A BorgWarner T-10 four-speed manual transmission was standard, as were unique traction bars, dual exhaust system, and fatter tires for better traction. A &quot;Shift-Command&quot; three-speed automatic transmission with the capability of manual shifting (BorgWarner model M-11B or M-12) was optional together with a floor console mounted shifter.

A popular &quot;Go-Package&quot; option was available with the four-barrel 343 or 390 engine. It included power-assisted front disk brakes, &quot;Twin-Grip&quot; differential, E70x14 red-stripe performance tires on 6-inch wide steel road wheels, heavy-duty suspension with thicker sway-bars, heavy-duty cooling, as well as other performance enhancements. A wide range of specialized performance parts were also available through AMC dealers for installation on customer&#x27;s cars. These were known as &quot;Group 19&quot; parts because of how AMC organized its parts books.

===Breedlove AMX===
According to several sources, &quot;Breedlove Replica&quot; cars to commemorate the speed and endurance records were offered by AMC. The &quot;Standard Catalog of American Muscle Cars 1960–1972&quot; describes an estimated 50 &quot;Breedlove&quot; AMXs were sold featuring the red, white, and blue paint scheme along with the standard 4-barrel V8 with four-speed manual transmission.

However, AMC historians argue there was no &quot;factory literature, order sheets, advertising, photographs, or anything else to properly document any factory 1968 or 1969 &#x27;Breedlove Replica&#x27; AMXs.&quot; According to historians a new car that a dealer in Canada ordered could not have been painted at the factory, but rather outsourced to local Kenosha body shops to perform the final painting.

===Playmate AMX===
&quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1968 Playmate of the Year, Angela Dorian, was awarded a specially painted &quot;Playmate Pink&quot; 1968 AMX. It was powered by the base 290 V8 with automatic transmission, air conditioning, tilt wheel, AM/8-track radio and optional rear bumper guards. Aside from the unique color, it differed from other AMXs with its dashboard number plate containing Dorian&#x27;s measurements, making her car AMX 36–24–35. The car, currently owned by Mark Melvin who purchased it from Dorian in 2010, was featured in an episode of Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage.

Some sources describe other AMXs as having been painted Playmate Pink at the factory. AMC&#x27;s marketing vice-president, Bill , who handed over the keys to Angela Dorian&#x27;s car, mentioned that &quot;a number of them&quot; were finished in pink.

In late 1968, a Playmate Pink AMX was special-ordered by a dealership in rural Potosi, Missouri. This 1969 model year car&#x27;s door tag indicates a &quot;00&quot; paint code (meaning a special-order color). It has a 390 V8 with automatic transmission, as well as the performance &quot;GO&quot; Package, air conditioning, and leather seats.

===Hertz rent-a-racer===
In the late-1960s, The Hertz Corporation offered &quot;rent-a-racer&quot; program in selected locations that included cars such as Corvettes, Jaguar XK-Es, Shelby Mustangs, and AMXs. There is no record of how many AMXs were ordered by Hertz for their fleet. Still, the factory &quot;Build Sheet&quot; for a car may indicate that AMC sold the car to Hertz.

===Von Piranha Edition===
Thoroughbred Motors in Denver, Colorado, modified an estimated 22 new AMXs for select AMC dealerships to have ready-made racers for both the dragstrips and road courses nearby. They were named &quot;Von Piranha&quot; and the changes included the addition of two sets of air scoops on each C-pillar with ducts to cool the rear brakes and on the roof above the windshield that was reportedly functional to cool the cockpit on race-bred versions. The AMX&#x27;s twin hood bulges were cut open to increase airflow in the engine bay. The original Piranha buildup was believed to have AMC&#x27;s Group 19 R4B intake stamped with the Von Piranha logo and a 950 CFM Holley three-barrel carburetor. The sales manager at Thoroughbred at the time and local racing legend, Ronald Hunter, raced a Piranha at the Continental Divide Raceways and other events.

==1969==


The AMX&#x27;s full second model year saw only slight changes, except for a $52 increase in its base price. The five-spoke Magnum 500 steel road wheels were no longer chrome plated, but now came with a stainless steel trim ring. The racing stripes were now available in five colors. The interior featured a revised instrumentation with the 0–8000 rpm tachometer moved to match the speedometer that was now calibrated to . Interior door panels were revised, carpeting was upgraded, new leather upholstery was optional, and the gas pedal became suspended. Later production cars received a hood over the instruments in front of the driver. Trunk capacity was .

Starting in January 1969, all manual transmission AMXs came with a Hurst floor shifter. The center console-mounted three-speed &quot;Shift-Command&quot; automatic remained optional with &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; forward settings. The &quot;D&quot; mode was for fully automatic operation, but the driver could shift manually through all three gears by starting in the &quot;1&quot; setting for first gear with no upshift, then the &quot;2&quot; setting for second gear with no upshift, and finally to third-gear in the &quot;D&quot; setting.

A &quot;Big Bad&quot; paint option for $34 became available in mid-1969. The neon brilliant blue (BBB), orange (BBO), and green (BBG) exteriors included color-matched front and rear bumpers, as well as a unique slim bright lower grille moulding for the front bumper and two vertical rubber-faced painted bumper guards for the rear. The factory-painted 1969 AMXs were 195 in BBB, 285 in BBO, and 283 in BBG.

&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; wrote that the 1969 &quot;AMX preserves the status quo this year, being virtually unchanged, and remains an absolute delight to drive.&quot;

===California 500 Special===
The &quot;California 500 Special&quot; is a version of 1969 AMXs sold only by Southern California American Motors Dealer Association members. It was part of a marketing campaign to commemorate the 1969 season at the Riverside International Raceway. They would serve as pace car and the dealers would sell replicas. All were finished in Big Bad Green with black stripes and included the 390 Go-Pac, automatic transmission, air conditioning, power steering, adjustable steering wheel, tinted windows, radio, light group, visibility group, and a saddle leather interior. The cars also featured &quot;Trendsetter Sidewinder&quot; exhaust side pipes in place of the molding strips on the rocker panels and were identified by brass plaques mounted on the hood blisters that had crossed checkered racing flags and the words 500 Special. A total of 283 AMXs were built in Big Bad Green for the 1969 model year; however, the exact number of California 500 Special versions is unknown, with only an estimate of 32.

===Super Stock AMX===
AMC also introduced the Super Stock AMX. To maximize quarter-mile performance, the 390 engine was equipped with twin Holley carburetors and 12.3:1 compression-ratio cylinder heads, plus aftermarket &quot;Doug&#x27;s&quot; headers and exhaust system, and the tires were drag slicks. Hurst Performance carried out several additional modifications.

American Motors rated the car at , but the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) rated it at and shuffled it among various competition classes that included SS/G and SS/D. The Super Stock AMXs were also put in SS/E class by NHRA based on the car&#x27;s weight and estimated and ultimately slotted into the SS/C class.

Most of the cars were prepared and custom-painted by AMC dealers to be campaigned at big racing events where they ran in the low 11s on the tracks. The best recorded quarter-mile was 10.73 seconds at .

The Super Stock AMX was meant for the race track and lacked comfort equipment such as a heater. The car could be ordered in all white or vertical bands of red, white, and blue, distinguishing numerous AMC competition cars of the day. The base price was $5,994, approximately $1,900 more than a fully loaded 1969 AMX. Moreover, the factory warranty was unavailable for these cars.

===Pikes Peak cars===
The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb used 1969 AMXs as pace cars for the hillclimb race to the summit of Pikes Peak that was held on 29 June 1969 in Colorado.

The AMX Pace and Courtesy cars were used by racers (including Bobby Unser) to practice the week before the race up the mountain. There were 12 (10 according to some sources) pace/courtesy AMXs, and all were equipped with the &quot;390 Go-Pac&quot; option and finished in &quot;Frost White&quot; with red stripes and red interiors.

Many AMC and Jeep vehicles have participated in the annual race, winning class titles and setting records. However, the only two-seat AMX officially raced in the hill climb was a 1969 model by Larry G. Mitchell in the 1987 &quot;Vintage&quot; class.

===AMX-R===
The original AMX&#x27;s &quot;Ramble&quot; seat idea was considered for possible production. A working prototype was built in 1968 from a regular AMX by James Jeffords, a designer-customizer, and was named the AMX-R. Jeffords was also head of the Javelin Trans Am Racing Team for AMC. Together with industrial designer Brooks Stevens, they decided to also &quot;plush up&quot; the interior, add custom paint treatment and hood with Jeffords&#x27;s name in badge form, as well as a modified suspension as part of their plan to offer an optional Ramble seat for 500 production cars. The prototype was prepared by Dave Puhl&#x27;s House of Kustoms in Palatine, Illinois. However, numerous problems prevented serial production, including safety and product liability concerns, AMC&#x27;s refusal to sell him the cars to modify, as well as the adverse reaction from Ralph Nader to the exposed exterior seating idea. The AMX-R&#x27;s special blacked-out hood treatment would later be offered as a &quot;shadow mask&quot; option on 1970 AMX models.

==1970==



American Motors 1970 AMX advertising headlined, &quot;We made the AMX look tougher this year because it&#x27;s tougher this year&quot;. They were mildly facelifted resembling the first two model years, but the changes were different enough to be a separate design for 1970. Featured was a new front-end design with a longer hood that had a &quot;power blister&quot; with two large openings. These air intakes were functional cold ram-air induction system with the popular &quot;Go Package&quot; available with the 360 and 390 engines. The new grille was flush and full-width, incorporating the headlamps. The revised rear end also featured full-width taillamps and a single center-mounted backup light. Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. Riding on the same wheelbase as before, the changes increased the AMX&#x27;s overall body length by about to .

American Motors also changed the AMX&#x27;s engine lineup for 1970 with the introduction of a new four-barrel (, P-code) to replace the V8. The smallest 290 was dropped, and AMC could claim 65 more base horsepower than the AMXs featured previously. The V8 engine continued, but upgraded to new heads with combustion chambers that increased power to at 4800 rpm and of torque at 3200 rpm. The code remained &quot;X&quot; for the engine on the vehicle identification number (VIN). The &quot;Go package&quot; was available with the engine (including power front disc brakes, F70x14 raised white letter tires, handling package, heavy-duty cooling, and the ram-air induction system) for $298.85, or including the 390 engine for $383.90.

Also new, the front double wishbone suspension had ball joints, upper and lower control arms, coil springs, and shock absorbers above the upper control arms; as well as trailing struts on the lower control arms. The &quot;Magnum 500&quot; road wheels were now standard, but the new &quot;Machine&quot; 15x7 inch slot-styled wheels became a mid-year option.

The interiors of the AMX were also redesigned. The broad wood-grained dashboard, center console, and two-spoke &quot;Rim Blow&quot; steering wheel were new. Tall bucket seats now featured a &quot;clamshell design&quot; integrating the headrests. Leather upholstery was $34 extra. The exterior rearview mirror featured a new design that sometimes matched the car&#x27;s body color. The three &quot;Big Bad&quot; exterior paints continued to be optional on the 1970 AMXs, but they now came with regular chrome bumpers. A new &quot;shadow mask&quot; exterior finish applied over any available AMX color was a $52 option, which included a satin black-painted hood, engine compartment, front fender tops, and side window surrounds offset by thin silver striping. The optional &quot;C-stripe&quot; was $32.

The manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price (MSRP) for the base model was US$3,395 (US$ in dollars) as AMC promoted the 1970 AMX as, &quot;A sports car for the price of a sporty car.&quot;

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; summed up a road test of a 1970 AMX with the 390 engine as &quot;one of the better-constructed cars around.&quot; Described as &quot;the best version yet of this blend of muscle car and sports car&quot;, the 1970 model was also the last &quot;true AMX&quot;.

=== Racing ===

As an American-built two-seater, the AMC AMX was a high-performance car with few equals. They were campaigned with factory support and by independents in a variety of road and track racing series as well as being classified as grand tourers.

The cars were regular performers on dragstrips across the United States. Drivers included Shirley Shahan, better known as the &quot;Drag-On Lady&quot;, and Lou Downy. National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) champion Wally Booth raced AMXs in both the Super Stock and the Pro Stock classes. Herman Lewis, often described &quot;as &#x27;the Godfather of AMC Racing&#x27; ... won 200 events in his hellacious red, white, and blue AMX.&quot;

The 1968 and 1969 AMXs with AMC&#x27;s engines compete in contemporary Nostalgia Super Stock drag racing. Owners have also modified AMXs to compete in modern Pro Touring car racing.

The Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) classed the AMX in B Production for amateur competition, the same class as the Shelby GT350. An AMX scored second place in the 1969 SCCA national championship. Dwight Knupp drove his AMX just 1 minute and 14 seconds behind a Corvette&#x27;s winning average of on 30 November 1969, at the Daytona International Speedway with 16 cars in the B production class, and placed sixth overall out of the total of 28 A and B class cars competing in the race. The two-seat AMX was never eligible for SCCA Trans-Am competition.

A 1969 AMX was entered in the 1971 and 1972 Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, an unofficial automobile race from New York City and Darien, CT, on the US Atlantic (east) coast, to Redondo Beach, a Los Angeles suburb on the Pacific (west) coast. A team of enthusiastic brothers, Tom and Ed Bruerton, finished the 1971 competition in fifth place. They drove in 37 hours and 48 minutes at an average of , with no speeding tickets. Their AMX already had on the odometer and the brothers had previously taken it on numerous endurance rides, including &quot;a rocky ride the entire length of the Baja California Peninsula.&quot; They again entered &quot;their battlescarred AMX one more time&quot; in the 1972 run. The brothers finished in eighth place, making the coast-to-coast outlaw race in 39 hours and 42 minutes at an average of .

==Production==
The two-seat AMX was built for three model years following its debut as a mid-year model on 15 February 1968. The first 1968 model year cars were scheduled to appear in dealer showrooms on 19 March 1968.

AMC AMX model year production totals in the U.S., by engine and transmission:
In 1969, American Motors showed the next generation AMX/2 concept car in the automobile show circuit. As the two-seater AMX production ceased in 1970, AMC was developing a sophisticated European-engineered alternative, the AMX/3 for 1971 introduction. However, overall economic conditions changed with spiraling inflation pushing sales of smaller cars along with the insurance companies&#x27; decision to penalize high-powered automobiles resulting in decreasing the sports-type car market segment, and the AMX was made into a high-performance model of the 4-seat Javelin starting in 1971.

===Assembly in Australia===
A total of 24 right-hand drive 1969 model-year AMXs were hand-assembled under license in Australia by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) between August 1969 and July 1970. They used the name Rambler AMX as AMI produced the Rambler range of cars since October 1960. Complete knock down (CKD) kits were shipped from Kenosha, Wisconsin to AMI&#x27;s facilities at Port Melbourne in Victoria. Only three colors were offered: White, Safety Wattle Yellow, and Signal Red.

Differences to the RHD Australian AMXs (compared to the U.S. models) included different outside rear-view mirrors and black vinyl trim inside the &quot;AMX&quot; circle logo on the C-pillars. As with other Australian-assembled AMC models built in right-hand drive, windscreen wipers were not reversed, remaining LHD pattern, but the power brake booster and heater on the firewall were swapped over. Although the power steering pump remained in its usual left location, the remainder of the steering components were on the right side of the car. The cars came with and automatic transmission, power steering, power disk brakes, &quot;twin-grip&quot; rear axle, and other items that were optional on the U.S. models. All Australian AMX interiors were finished in black and featured unique seats, door panels, and a fiberglass RHD dashboard with a wood-grained instrument cluster in front of the driver. The Australian AMXs came with a significant level of equipment and were promoted as &quot;personal super cars&quot;.

==Concept and show cars==
===1966 AMX===
A concept car with a folding exposed rear seat was introduced by AMC at the 1966 Society of Automotive Engineers convention in Detroit. This was the first &quot;AMX&quot; (American Motors Experimental) named car. The sports car design features a rumble seat for two additional passengers that was described as a &quot;Ramble Seat&quot; in homage to the automaker&#x27;s predecessor Rambler models. This back seat folds into the trunk space, and the rear window flips down, but these are not fully weatherproof designs. The roof design also has no &quot;A&quot; pillars, providing greater visibility. The fiberglass-bodied &quot;pushmobile&quot; concept has no interior, engine, drivetrain, or suspension. The concept was widely covered by the automotive media and the car featured on several auto magazine covers. It was painted orange or metallic blue to be shown on the auto show circuit. It received positive reviews that convinced management to put the car into production.

This 1966 AMX also gave rise to several other AMX show cars.

===AMX I===
A fiberglass-bodied AMX I concept car was made in 1966 to be part of AMC&#x27;s &quot;Project IV&quot; exhibit. Built by Smith Inland of Ionia, Michigan, one of the two fiberglass-bodied concept cars was reportedly destroyed in a crash test convincing AMC&#x27;s engineers and designers to use a traditional steel body. The remaining domestic-built fiberglass prototype features round headlamps.

American Motors&#x27; president Roy Abernethy sanctioned the Turin coachbuilder Vignale to construct an operational car in steel. It was a hand-built show car using a modified 1966 Rambler American chassis on a wheelbase powered by a V8 engine. Delivered in 78 days and known as the &quot;AMX Vignale&quot;, it was first displayed at the 1966 New York International Auto Show. The Vignale car features a &quot;split-vee&quot; windshield. This cantilever-type roof incorporates a built-in concealed roll bar, rectangular European-type headlamps, and a custom interior with full bucket seats flanking an aircraft-type console. The fully functional &quot;Ramble-Seat&quot; was operated by a push-button from inside the car.

===AMX II===
Vince Gardner, an outside consultant, designed the fiberglass-bodied AMX II, a less radical two-door for the &quot;Project IV&quot; exhibit. This four-passenger hardtop (no B-pillar) notchback coupe had little in common with the AMX I. This car featured a longer wheelbase and an overall length of . The windshield wiper blades were concealed by a panel that raises when wipers are activated. The grille that was surrounded by a massive bumper had horizontal multi-bars with hidden headlamps. Safety innovations included doors that locked automatically when the engine was started, reflectors on the sides of the rear fenders, rear tail lamps that signaled the driver&#x27;s intentions: green when the car is in motion, amber when the driver removes foot from the accelerator, and red when braking.

===AMX GT===

Developed for the 1968 auto show circuit, the AMX GT is a concept car based on a shortened and &quot;chopped&quot; Javelin with a Kammback rear end. The AMX GT show car provided design clues to future production models and performance options.

===AMX-400===
In the late 1960s, George Barris made bolt-on customizing kits for the AMX that were marketed through AMC dealers. Changing customer preferences meant that traditional car customization was being replaced by quick bolt-on accessory personalization. Barris joined this trend by offering a variety of spoiler, body additions, and wheel options. American Motors requested Barris to provide enhancements for the Javelins and the AMX. Available through AMC dealers as complete kits or as separate items. The package included a performance hood, rear spoiler, grille, racing side mirrors, and unique wheels.

Barris also performed a radical custom treatment on a 1969 AMX. The car was built for the second season of episodes of the &quot;Banacek&quot; detective television series. It was a true custom for that time, and working with Joe Bailon, the car was lowered, and its body was heavily modified. Its roof was cut down almost and the car was lengthened by . Featuring a sculpted body with louvered accents, it became known as the AMX-400. The car featured a taillight system that glowed green during acceleration, amber during deceleration, and red during braking.

===AMX/3===


A third-generation AMX concept car, the AMX/3, debuted at the February 1970 Chicago Auto Show. Engine-less and fashioned in fiberglass, the original AMX/3 prototype was a &quot;push-mobile&quot; show car only. Introduced in Rome in March 1970, the functional steel prototype was constructed by Giotto Bizzarrini, Salvatore Diomante, and Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign.

American Motors placed an order for 30 operational cars. The AMX/3 body mold was sent to Italian grand tourer maker Giotto Bizzarrini, whose Turin facility hand made driveable mid-engined, steel-bodied cars. Built on a wheelbase, the Bizzarrini prototypes used the AMC V8 and an Italian OTO Melara four-speed transaxle. The AMX/3 is considered one of Bizzarrini&#x27;s car-masterpieces.

The steel Italian cars differed from the original AMC design in having fewer but functional rear decklid louvers, louvered hoods, and, in some cases, hood scoops to direct fresh air into the heating-A/C system. Further engineering improvements and road testing was done by BMW, which declared the AMX/3&#x27;s chassis one of the stiffest having a 50% higher stiffness compared to a benchmark Mercedes-Benz model. The car&#x27;s steel semi-monocoque chassis design with its welded on steel body provided a strong overall structure while the top speed was verified to , with reports indicating the AMX/3 could go faster if it was not for the tendency for the front end to lift at those speeds, but BMW found the car to be most neutral handling they had ever tested. The BMW engineers also refined numerous components of the AMX/3 into &quot;a world-class contender among the mid-engined super car elite of its time.&quot; One of the cars became known as the &quot;Monza&quot; after it achieved a top speed of in testing at the famed Italian race track.&quot;

Five completed cars were produced before the US$2,000,000 development program was canceled. The original projection by AMC called for building 5,000 AMX/3s per year, but the estimated retail price kept increasing. The AMX/3 was &quot;beautiful and sleek, the kind of car that would have made hearts race in the day&quot; and was to be a &quot;flagship or halo car&quot; to lure customers to AMC dealerships, &quot;where they would often end up with other, more practical models.&quot; However, escalating costs and pending bumper regulations put a stop to the mid-engined AMX/3.

Some remaining parts from the canceled, second group of five cars were used by erstwhile Bizzarrini collaborator Salvatore Diomante to assemble the sixth car, named and marketed as Sciabola. Additionally, an open two-seat Spider featuring no weather protection was built in the 1990s using an unfinished AMX/3 modified chassis and the 7th AMX/3, on display at the Autoworld Museum in Belgium, were both finished by Giorgio Giordanengo.

===1971 Teague AMX===

Sales of the two-seat AMX were lower than the numbers AMC executives wanted. Still, AMC&#x27;s vice president for styling, Dick Teague, wanted to continue the sports model. American Motors&#x27; Advanced Design Studio made design proposals for a 1971 AMX and Teague requestedand received permissionto produce a fully working concept car.

Starting with a Frost White 1968 AMX coupe as the development mule, Teague updated its front end to the grille and swooping front fenders of what was incorporated into the production 1971 Javelin. The concept car also featured the interior to what was to become AMC&#x27;s characteristic high-backed bucket seats and corduroy upholstery introduced in 1970. The concept car was repainted light metallic blue with red striping to match the interior. A short-wheelbase, two-seat 1971 AMX was not approved for production by the automaker, but Teague used this car as his daily driver.

==Legacy==



The AMX was intended to be a “halo car” for American Motors. Another objective was &quot;lowering the median age of visitors to AMC showrooms; in that role it was a major success&quot; even though however the sales goals not achieved. The two-seat AMC AMX has been described as being &quot;a perfect car for many who lusted for the Corvette but could not afford it.&quot; Developed under &quot;austere budject&quot; the AMX and the four-seat Javelin were designed to be radical departures from AMC&#x27;s economy image.

Automotive journalist Patric George noted that the AMC AMX is &quot;great vintage American iron&quot; with only &quot;two seats, making it more of a sports car than a lot of other muscle cars.&quot; Automotive historian and author Richard M. Langworth noted that the AMX has &quot;all the right sports-car stuff&quot; and that the &quot;little machine that can only go up in value over the long haul.&quot;

According to CNN, before 2004, the AMX had been under-appreciated from an investment standpoint. In 2004, there was considerable variation between the values of two-seat AMXs and four-seat Javelin AMXs. Craig Fitzgerald mentioned &quot;the satisfaction in owning a car that you don&#x27;t see every single day, or on the cover of every single magazine.&quot; Fitzgerald favored the two-seater because of its rarity, but noted that some parts for either car were expensive.

In 2006, the editors of &quot;Hemmings Muscle Machines&quot; magazine said that AMCs had &quot;experienced notable value increases over the last few yearsespecially AMXs...&quot; The book &quot;Keith Martin&#x27;s Guide to Car Collecting&quot;, in collaboration with the editors of the monthly &quot;Sports Car Market&quot;, lists the 1970 AMX as one of the picks under $40,000 among &quot;Nine Muscle Car Sleepers&quot;.

Unique versions, such as the California 500 Specials and the 52 Hurst-modified SS/AMX drag race cars are perhaps the most highly sought after by collectors. In 2006, a California 500 AMX sold for $54,000 at the Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, while a regular AMX went for over $55,000 at the Mecum collector auction in Belvidere, Illinois. In 2007, &quot;Hemmings&quot; wrote that only about 39 of the original SS/AMX turn-key race cars may have survived.

By 2007, the AMX was &quot;among the most highly sought AMC cars&quot; and &quot;really taking off in the muscle-car market&quot;. Also in 2007, &quot;Hemmings&quot; said that the two-seater AMX had &quot;a strong following among old car hobbyists and collectors of historic vehicles and nearly every one of the 19,134 built...remains in circulation and in demand, ensuring a good future for the first-generation AMX as a collectible muscle car.&quot; The 2007 book &quot;Classic Cars&quot; states that AMC&#x27;s small and powerful AMX &quot;had tire-burning speed&quot; and &quot;all have become collector&#x27;s items.&quot;

Noting the increasing values of the 1968–1970 AMXs, &quot;Hemmings&quot; listed them among the &quot;21 hottest cars&quot; enthusiasts wanted in 2007 &quot;and will want tomorrow.&quot;

In 2008, &quot;Hemmings&quot; wrote buyers had &quot;only recently &#x27;discovered&#x27; the AMX; they&#x27;re now snapping them up left and right. Prices ... are on the rise, though they still represent a relative bargain compared to many more common muscle machines.&quot;

In 2010, &quot;Hemmings Classic Car&quot; included the two-seat AMXs in their list of 32 best cars to restore in terms of economic sense after factoring purchase price, parts availability, as well as restored value and desirability.

Although low production, the AMX shared parts and components with other AMC models. There are many active AMC car clubs for these cars. Parts, including reproduction components, are available. However, &quot;AMC did not build cars in the vast numbers the Big Three did back in the day; therefore, there are fewer to restore and not as many parts to go around.&quot; As of 2010, &quot;Hemmings Classic Car&quot; wrote that the AMXs are &quot;pretty basic&quot; so they are not hard to restore, and that &quot;reproduction parts are available&quot; and continues to grow with many mechanical parts interchanging with other cars.

More valuable according to automotive historian and author, James C. Mays, is the &quot;wow factor&quot;. His book, &quot;The Savvy Guide to Buying Collector Cars at Auction&quot;, explains this important and measurable pleasure to an owner, whether their car is driven or sits in a climate-controlled garage, such as a red 1969 AMX that attracts more attention than the more prestigious Ferraris and Lamborghinis.

The 100th issue of &quot;Hemmings Classic Car&quot; listed the &quot;Top 100 American collector cars ever made&quot; as selected by the editors of &quot;Hemmings Motor News&quot; based on &quot;the most popular models among both enthusiasts and collectors&quot; and included the 1968–1969 AMXs for both rarity and high interest, as well as &quot;they boast sporting lines, traditional long-hood/short-deck proportions, and a smattering of performance options to add spice.&quot;

&quot;Old Cars Weekly&quot; describes the AMX as an &quot;appealing little package for adrenaline junkies and guys ... who have an appetite for something a little offbeat and different ... a car that famed automotive scribe Tom McCahill once described as &#x27;harrier than a Borneo gorilla.&#x27;&quot;

===Scale models===
A variety of scale models of the AMX are available, including promotional 1/25-scale model manufactured under license from AMC by Jo-Han in factory colors. Hot Wheels offered a 1969 AMX custom in 1:64 scale, and in 1971 issued the AMX/2 show car model. Newer models in 1:18 scale diecast were issued, including the Playboy Pink version in the &quot;Best of the Best&quot; series, as well as the modified &quot;Drag-On Lady&quot; race car. According to the editors of &quot;Die Cast X Magazine&quot;, &quot;muscle cars are the largest, most popular category in die-cast&quot; collectors. They included the AMC AMX among the 34 models representing &quot;the best and most important from the genre ... performance and style that are the hallmarks of the high point of American automotive history.&quot;

<text>The HP 33s (F2216A) was a scientific calculator marketed by Hewlett-Packard. It was introduced in 2003 as the successor to the HP 32SII, and discontinued on the introduction of its successor, the HP 35s in 2007.

==Features==
Its main features are:
* RPN or traditional semi-algebraic (infix data/algebraic operator entry/postfix one-number function entry), user-selectable
* Two-line LCD display
* Full scientific/engineering mathematical features
* Keystroke-programmable with full boolean and program-control command sets and line edit, insert and delete
* HP &quot;equation list&quot; equation editor (fully algebraic) in both the stand-alone list as well as in keystroke programs
* HP Solver feature (solves equations and functions for one unknown)
* Function integration feature
* All mathematical operations and features fully functional in all modes
* Unit conversion and constants
* 31 KB of random-access user memory (equivalent to about 7 KB on earlier HP programmable models)

The main differences from the HP 32SII are:
* A radical difference in keypad layout and appearance
* Memory is expanded from 2 KB to 32 KB
* Faster processor
* More functions
* Algebraic entry mode as well as RPN
* The display has two lines
* The length of an equation was now restricted to 255 characters (no arbitrary limit in the 32SII)

The HP 33s was co-designed and manufactured by Kinpo Electronics of Taiwan.

==Reception==
The 33s is generally considered to have fewer logic bugs than the HP 35s. However, the unconventional chevron-styled keypad has been regarded by reviewers as bizarre and difficult to use compared to other HP professional calculators.

==Revisions==
The 33s went through numerous revisions that have solved two of the most pervasive issues people had with the early models (namely poor screen quality and bad keypad responsiveness).

<doc id="630175" wikidata="Q633894" url="?curid=630175" title="Object Pascal">
<text>Object Pascal is an extension to the programming language Pascal that provides object-oriented programming (OOP) features such as classes and methods.

The language was originally developed by Apple Computer as &quot;Clascal&quot; for the Lisa Workshop development system. As Lisa gave way to Macintosh, Apple collaborated with Niklaus Wirth, the author of Pascal, to develop an officially standardized version of Clascal. This was renamed Object Pascal. Through the mid-1980s, Object Pascal was the main programming language for early versions of the MacApp application framework. The language lost its place as the main development language on the Mac in 1991 with the release of the C++-based MacApp 3.0. Official support ended in 1996.

Symantec also developed a compiler for Object Pascal for their Think Pascal product, which could compile programs much faster than Apple&#x27;s own Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop (MPW). Symantec then developed the Think Class Library (TCL), based on MacApp concepts, which could be called from both Object Pascal and THINK C. The Think suite largely displaced MPW as the main development platform on the Mac in the late 1980s.

Symantec ported Object Pascal to the PC, and developed a similar object framework on that platform. In contrast to TCL, which eventually migrated to C++, the PC libraries remained mainly based on Pascal.

Borland added support for object-oriented programming to Turbo Pascal 5.5, which would eventually become the basis for the Object Pascal dialect used in Delphi created by Anders Hejlsberg. Delphi remained mainstream for business applications on the PC into the early 2000s, and was partly displaced in the 2000s with the introduction of the .NET Framework which included Hejlsberg&#x27;s C#.

==History==
===Apple Pascal===
Pascal became a major language in the programming world in the 1970s, with high-quality implementations on most minicomputer platforms and microcomputers. Among the latter was the UCSD Pascal system, which compiled to an intermediate &quot;p-System&quot; code format that could then run on multiple platforms. Apple licensed UCSD and used it as the basis for their Apple Pascal system for the Apple II and Apple III.

Pascal became one of the major languages in the company in this period. With the start of the Apple Lisa project, Pascal was selected as the main programming language of the platform, although this time as a &quot;compiler&quot; in contrast to the p-System &quot;interpreter&quot;.

===Clascal and Apple&#x27;s early Object Pascal===
Object Pascal is an extension of the Pascal language that was developed at Apple Computer by a team led by Larry Tesler in consultation with Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of Pascal. It is descended from an earlier object-oriented version of Pascal named Clascal, which was available on the Lisa computer.

Object Pascal was needed to support MacApp, an expandable Macintosh application framework that would now be termed a class library. Object Pascal extensions, and MacApp, were developed by Barry Haynes, Ken Doyle, and Larry Rosenstein, and were tested by Dan Allen. Larry Tesler oversaw the project, which began very early in 1985 and became a product in 1986.

An Object Pascal extension was also implemented in the Think Pascal integrated development environment (IDE). The IDE includes the compiler and an editor with syntax highlighting and checking, a powerful debugger, and a class library. Many developers preferred Think Pascal over Apple&#x27;s implementation of Object Pascal because Think Pascal offered a much faster compile–link–debug cycle, and tight integration of its tools. The last official release of Think Pascal was 4.01, in 1992. Symantec later released an unofficial version 4.5d4 at no charge.

Apple dropped support for Object Pascal when they moved from Motorola 68000 series chips to IBM&#x27;s PowerPC architecture in 1994. MacApp 3.0, had already been rewritten in C++ and ported to this platform.

Metrowerks offered with CodeWarrior an Object Pascal compiler for Macintosh that targeted both 68k and PowerPC, both in their IDE and as MPW tools. Macintosh developers using Object Pascal had a path to port to the PowerPC, even architecture after both Apple and Symantec dropped support. MacApp 2.0, written in Object Pascal, was ported to the PowerPC using CodeWarrior.

==Borland, Inprise, CodeGear, and Embarcadero years==
In 1986, Borland introduced similar extensions, also named Object Pascal, to the Turbo Pascal product for the Macintosh, and in 1989 for Turbo Pascal 5.5 for DOS. When Borland refocused from DOS to Windows in 1994, they created a successor to Turbo Pascal, named Delphi, and introduced a new set of extensions to create what is now known as the Delphi language.

The development of Delphi started in 1993 and Delphi 1.0 was officially released in the United States on 14 February 1995. While code using the Turbo Pascal object model could still be compiled, Delphi featured a new syntax using the keyword codice_1 in preference to codice_2, the Create constructor and a virtual Destroy destructor (and negating having to call the codice_3 and codice_4 procedures), properties, method pointers, and some other things. These were inspired by the ISO working draft for object-oriented extensions, but many of the differences from Turbo Pascal&#x27;s dialect (such as the draft&#x27;s requirement that all methods be virtual) were ignored. 

The Delphi language has continued to evolve over the years to support constructs such as dynamic arrays, generics and anonymous methods. The old object syntax introduced by Apple (&quot;Old-Style Object Types&quot;) is still supported.

==Versions==
* Borland used the name &quot;Object Pascal&quot; for the programming language in the first versions, but later renamed it to &quot;Delphi&quot;. Compilers that claim to be compatible with Object Pascal are often trying to be compatible with Delphi source code. Because Delphi is a trademark, compatible compilers continue using the name &quot;Object Pascal&quot;.
* Embarcadero Technologies, which purchased Delphi in 2008, sells the Delphi integrated development environment (IDE) that compiles the Delphi dialect of Object Pascal to Windows and macOS, iOS, Android and Web.
* .NET support existed from Delphi 8 through Delphi 2005, 2006, and 2007, which now has been replaced by another language, &quot;Oxygene&quot; (see below), which is not fully backward-compatible.
* The Oxygene language developed by RemObjects Software targets the Common Language Infrastructure, the Java Runtime Environment and Apple&#x27;s Cocoa frameworks for iOS and macOS.
* The open source Free Pascal project allows the language to be compiled for a wide range of operating systems, including Linux (32-bit, 64-bit), FreeBSD, Classic Mac OS, macOS, Solaris, Windows API (32, 64, CE), the ARM instruction set architecture (ISA), and several other hardware architectures. The first version of Free Pascal for the iPhone software development kit (SDK) 2.&quot;x&quot; was announced on January 17, 2009.
* The Smart Pascal language targets ECMAScript–JavaScript and is used in Smart Mobile Studio, written by Jon Lennart Aasenden and published by Optimale Systemer (2012). The language greatly simplifies HTML5 development through object-oriented, and rapid application development (RAD) methods. Smart Pascal integrates tightly with established technologies such as node.js, Embarcadero DataSnap, and Remobjects SDK to produce high-performance client–server model web applications. The language allows easy creation of visual components and reusable libraries. The Smart Pascal dialect stems from the DWScript language, extended to better integrate with the JavaScript environment and libraries, such as codice_5 sections which are plain JavaScript but have access to Pascal symbols, or &quot;external&quot; classes which map directly to prototypal JavaScript classes. Smart Pascal introduces true inheritance, classes, partial classes, interfaces, a virtual method table and many other advanced constructs which are not a part of JavaScript by default.
* The Morfik Pascal language, developed by Morfik, targets Ajax-enabled Web applications. The compiler is built into the company&#x27;s AppsBuilder IDE and allows Object Pascal code to be used in implementing code to execute in a browser or server. It uses the Free Pascal compiler to generate native binaries from Object Pascal.
* The open source GNU Pascal compiler is available as a front-end to the GNU Compiler Collection, which implements the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7185 Pascal standard, and most of the ISO 10206 Extended Pascal standard.
* Turbo51 is a free compiler to program Intel 8051 chips.
* WDSibyl is an open source Delphi-like IDE and compiler available for Microsoft Windows and OS/2, and is a commercial Turbo Pascal compatible environment released by a company named Speedsoft that was later developed into a Delphi-like RAD environment named Sybil, and then open sourced under the GPL when that company closed down. Wolfgang Draxler (WD) now maintains the software. The compiler used seems to be located in a DLL and is not open-source.

==Compilers==
Object Pascal compilers are available for a wide range of operating systems and architectures.

* Delphi is probably the best known compiler. It is the successor of the highly successful Borland Pascal and Turbo Pascal product line. It targets Windows 9x (Delphi 2007 and older), the Windows NT family, .NET Framework (Delphi 8, 2005, 2007), macOS (Delphi XE2 and later), iOS (Delphi XE2 and later, generating native binaries in XE4 and later), Android (Delphi XE5 and later, generating native binaries in XE5 and later). Support for .NET finally became a separate product known as Oxygene (see below).
* Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) is an open-source Object Pascal compiler that supports many Pascal dialects, including Turbo Pascal 7, Delphi, and others. Currently, FPC can generate code for IA-32, x86-64, PowerPC, SPARC, and ARM processors, and for several operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Classic Mac OS, and macOS (with an Xcode integration kit). Several separate projects exist to facilitate rapid application development with FPC, the most prominent one being Lazarus (IDE).
* GNU Pascal (a separately distributed part of the GNU Compiler Collection), while not formally aimed at the Delphi dialect of Pascal, does contain a Turbo Pascal compatibility mode, and is very slowly incorporating a few Delphi language features. It is unsuitable for recompiling large bodies of Delphi code directly, but is notable as having prolific support for operating systems and hardware architectures.
* Oxygene (formerly &quot;Chrome&quot;) is an Object Pascal compiler from RemObjects Software that integrates into Microsoft Visual Studio. It is also available as free command-line interface compiler that runs native on CLI. It is three compilers in one, each targeting a different platform: Echoes for .NET Framework, Mono, WinRT and Windows Phone 8, Cooper for JDK and Android, and Nougat for iOS and macOS.

===Legacy products===
* Borland Kylix was a Linux variant of Delphi which only targets Intel 32-bit Linux using the Qt library. It does not work out of the box with most modern Linux distributions.
* Virtual Pascal was a free 32-bit Turbo Pascal and Delphi compatible compiler for mainly OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. Later, it also received a DOS+ Extender and an experimental Linux cross-compiler. The compiler&#x27;s development stopped at about the level of Delphi 2. In 2007, its official website ceased to operate, and further development ceased.

==Interpreters==

Pascal Script (formerly &quot;InnerFuse&quot;) and DWScript (Delphi Web Script) are open-source Object Pascal interpreters and scripting engines written in Delphi. They support subsets of Object Pascal. DWScript can also compile Object Pascal code into JavaScript code (Smart Pascal), and supports just-in-time compilation (JIT). Modern Pascal provides 3 different interpreters: a command-line interface (CLI), Apache Module (Celerity), and CodeRunner (node.js like solution able to handle different scripts per port), besides the ability to compile and protect a script&#x27;s source code.

==Sample &quot;Hello World&quot; programs==

Here are several &quot;Hello World&quot; programs in different Object Pascal versions.

===Apple version===

program ObjectPascalExample;

 type
 THelloWorld = object
 procedure Put;
 end;

 var
 HelloWorld: THelloWorld;

 procedure THelloWorld.Put;
 begin
 ShowMessage(&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;);
 end;

begin
 New(HelloWorld);
 HelloWorld.Put;
 Dispose(HelloWorld);
end.
===Turbo Pascal version===
Still supported in Delphi and Free Pascal. FPC also packages its own substitutes for the libraries/units. Delphi does not. The Free Pascal 1.0 series and the FPC textmode IDE are the largest open codebases in this dialect. Free Pascal 2.0 was rewritten in a more Delphi-like dialect, and the textmode IDE and related frameworks (Free Vision) are the only parts in the TP version of Object Pascal.

====Stack based allocation====

program ObjectPascalExample;

 type
 THelloWorld = object
 procedure Put;
 end;

 procedure THelloWorld.Put;
 begin
 WriteLn(&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;);
 end;

var
 HelloWorld: THelloWorld; { allocated on the stack and can be used without explicit allocation. }
begin
 HelloWorld.Put;
end.
====Heap based allocation====

program ObjectPascalExample;

 type
 PHelloWorld = ^THelloWorld;
 THelloWorld = object
 procedure Put;
 end;

 procedure THelloWorld.Put;
 begin
 WriteLn(&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;);
 end;

var
 HelloWorld: PHelloWorld; { this is a typed pointer to a THelloWorld }

begin
 New(HelloWorld);
 HelloWorld^.Put;
 Dispose(HelloWorld);
end.
Another example:
program ObjectPascalExample;

 type
 PHelloWorld = ^THelloWorld;
 THelloWorld = object
 procedure Put;
 end;

 procedure THelloWorld.Put;
 begin
 WriteLn(&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;);
 end;

var
 HelloWorld: PHelloWorld; { this is a typed pointer to a THelloWorld }
 HelloWorld2: ^THelloWorld; { this is exactly the same with different syntax } 
 HelloWorld3: ^THelloWorld; 
 HelloWorld4: PHelloWorld; 
begin
 { This works in a similar way as the code above, note the allocation and de-allocation, though,
 many people get confused. In the past there was a wrong example with wrong comments here... }

 New(HelloWorld); { one instance }
 HelloWorld4 := HelloWorld; { this is valid - a pointer copy }
 HelloWorld2 := HelloWorld; { this is valid - a pointer copy }
 New(HelloWorld3); { a second instance }
 HelloWorld4 := HelloWorld3; { this is valid - a pointer copy }
 HelloWorld2 := HelloWorld3; { this is valid - a pointer copy }
 Dispose(HelloWorld); { it allocates only two instances }
 Dispose(HelloWorld3); { so it must release only two instances }
end.
This works based on pointer copy, unless there is a specific allocation for a deeper copy.

===Delphi and Free Pascal version===

program ObjectPascalExample;

type
 THelloWorld = class
 procedure Put;
 end;

procedure THelloWorld.Put;
begin
 Writeln(&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;);
end;

var
 HelloWorld: THelloWorld; { this is an implicit pointer }

begin
 HelloWorld := THelloWorld.Create; { constructor returns a pointer to an object of type THelloWorld }
 HelloWorld.Put;
 HelloWorld.Free; { this line deallocates the THelloWorld object pointed to by HelloWorld }
end.

Note that the object construct is still available in Delphi and Free Pascal.

===Oxygene version===

namespace ObjectPascalExample;

 interface

 type
 ConsoleApp = class
 class method Main;
 end;

 THelloWorld = class
 method Put;
 end;

 implementation

 method THelloWorld.Put;
 begin
 Console.WriteLine(&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;);
 end;

 class method ConsoleApp.Main;
 begin
 var HelloWorld := new THelloWorld;
 HelloWorld.Put;
 end;

end.
===DWScript (Smart Pascal) version===

type
 THelloWorld = class
 procedure Put;
 begin
 PrintLn(&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;);
 end
 end;

var HelloWorld := THelloWorld.Create;
HelloWorld.Put;
The method implementation can also be made in a distinct location as in other Object Pascal dialects.

==Development==
Many features have been introduced continuously to Object Pascal with extensions to Delphi and extensions to FreePascal. In reaction to criticism, Free Pascal has adopted generics with the same syntax as Delphi, provided Delphi compatibility mode is selected, and both Delphi (partial) and Free Pascal (more extensive) support operator overloading. Delphi has also introduced many other features since version 7, including generics. Whereas FreePascal tries to be compatible to Delphi in Delphi compatibility mode, it also usually introduced many new features to the language that are not always available in Delphi.

<text>Smarty Jones (February 28, 2001) is a champion Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and came second in the Belmont Stakes.

==Background==
Born at Fairthorne Farm in Chester County, Pennsylvania, the horse was named after Milly &quot;Smarty Jones&quot; McNair, the mother of co-owner Pat Chapman. The two shared a birthday, and Mrs. Chapman wanted to honor her late mother. She said the horse was a strong-willed actor from birth and her mother too was a bit of a smart aleck as a child who had gotten the nickname &quot;Smarty.&quot;

He is a third-generation descendant of Mr. Prospector, and as such Smarty Jones is related to many recent Triple Crown hopefuls including Funny Cide, Afleet Alex, and Fusaichi Pegasus. Also included in his pedigree are Triple Crown winners Secretariat, Count Fleet, War Admiral, Gallant Fox and Omaha, and such other Triple Crown race winners as Northern Dancer, Foolish Pleasure and Man o&#x27; War, who is #1 on the list of Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. His dam was multiple stakes winner I&#x27;ll Get Along.

Pat Chapman and her husband, Roy &quot;Chappy&quot; Chapman, originally hired Bobby Camac to train Smarty Jones, but in December 2001, Camac and his wife were murdered by Camac&#x27;s stepson, Wade Russell, who was eventually convicted and sentenced to 28 years in prison. &quot;It was a total shock, numbing,&quot; Roy Chapman said. &quot;We didn&#x27;t know what to do next.&quot; This tragedy, combined with Roy Chapman&#x27;s failing health, resulted in the Chapmans&#x27; decision to disband their small breeding operation, retaining only two of their horses. One was Smarty Jones, the product of a breeding between their winningest horse, the mare I&#x27;ll Get Along, and the stallion Elusive Quality. Despite these influences, his Dosage Index of 3.40 suggested that he was capable of competing in the classics. In 2002, Smarty Jones was sent to Bridlewood Farm in Ocala, Florida, to prepare for racing.

==Racing career==
===2003: Two-Year-Old Season===
In 2003, the Chapmans gave Smarty Jones to John Servis for training. They sold the Someday Farm property and moved into a smaller home, training only four horses. On July 27, 2003, Servis was schooling Smarty Jones at the starting gate when the colt spooked, reared, and smashed his head on the top of the gate. He fell to the ground unconscious, blood pouring from his nostrils. Servis thought the horse was dead, but Smarty Jones regained consciousness and was treated by Dr. Dan Hanf, who stopped the hemorrhaging and treated him for shock. After the bleeding stopped, the colt&#x27;s head began to swell from the middle of his forehead over to his left eye. Dr. Hanf and assistant trainer Maureen Donnelly kept watch on the horse and kept him at the barn overnight. Hanf had seen the eye before the swelling and was confident the eye itself was not damaged but knew the horse must have sustained a fracture due to the excessive swelling. The colt was sent the next day, July 28, 2003, to the New Jersey Equine Clinic for x-rays. There he was diagnosed with a fractured skull. The bones around his left eye were so badly damaged that the veterinarians thought they might have to remove the eye. Smarty Jones overcame his injuries after three weeks in the hospital and spent more than a month recuperating on the farm. Two of the other entrants in the 2004 Kentucky Derby lacked sight in one eye, and Smarty Jones could have been the third.

Servis led him back into training and by early November 2003, the colt had recovered completely and was ready to make his racing debut at nearby Philadelphia Park. now known as Parx Casino and Racing, a racetrack in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. Canadian-born jockey Stewart Elliott was hired to ride Smarty Jones initially for the Bensalem race but took over a more permanent position when the horse began his winning streak. Elliot had won 3,300 races and was the son of jockey Dennis Elliott, Smarty Jones won the six-furlong race by lengths. Two weeks later, he won the Pennsylvania Nursery Stakes by 15 lengths, earning the best speed figure of his generation and among the best of any Derby winner as a 2 year old.

===2004: Three-Year-Old Season===
In January 2004, now racing as a three-year-old, Smarty Jones was given his first major test in the Count Fleet Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City. In the home stretch, the colt pulled away from the field to win by 5 lengths. In February, Smarty Jones was shipped to Oaklawn Park racetrack in Hot Springs, Arkansas in preparation for the Kentucky Derby. There, he won the Southwest Stakes, the Rebel Stakes (earning the fastest Thorograph number that had ever been given to a 3 year old), and the important Arkansas Derby.

On a rainy May 1, 2004, Smarty Jones entered the Kentucky Derby, where he became the post time favorite, and won. He became the first unbeaten winner of the race since Seattle Slew in 1977. Servis and Elliott became the first trainer/jockey combination in 25 years to win the Kentucky Derby in their debut appearance. Smarty Jones won the race by lengths, earning $854,800 for the Chapmans along with a bonus of $5 million from Oaklawn Park for sweeping the Rebel Stakes, the Arkansas Derby, and the Kentucky Derby. He also joined Lil E. Tee (1992 Derby winner) as the only Pennsylvania-bred horses to ever win the Kentucky Derby. Smarty Jones&#x27; year, 2004, was the 100th anniversary of the Triple Crown races.

On May 15, after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, Smarty Jones won the second leg of the Triple Crown with a victory at the 2004 Preakness Stakes by a record margin of lengths, becoming the first odds-on favorite to win the race since Spectacular Bid in 1979.

After his Preakness victory, Smarty Jones&#x27; popularity increased and he became, arguably, the #1 fan favorite to aspire to win the Triple Crown since Affirmed won it in 1978. He was the 10th horse since Affirmed to win both the Derby and the Preakness. His popularity increased the attendance of the races by 17,000 people and caused the highest television ratings in 14 years. Breeders made offers for the breeding rights to the horse, with the offers going as high as 40 to 50 million dollars. However, on June 5, 2004, Smarty Jones finished second in the Belmont Stakes, upset by a late charge by 36-1 long shot Birdstone. Speculation arose that the loss was a result of Elliott allowing Smarty Jones to assume the lead too early when being challenged by several competitors. However, neither Servis nor the Chapmans ever blamed his own jockey (Race video revealed that Elliott had a tight hold on the reins, and did not urge Smarty Jones until the quarter pole). Others pointed to Smarty Jones&#x27; relatively unfavorable 3.40 Dosage Index as being a portent of his inability to successfully negotiate the -mile Belmont distance (Birdstone&#x27;s Dosage Index was 1.77; the lower the Dosage number, supposedly the better suited a horse is to longer races). Smarty Jones ran the opening mile and a quarter in a time that would have won all but 3 Kentucky Derbys in history and was 8 lengths in front of the show horse. The 120,139 in attendance at Belmont Park that day marked the largest crowd ever to see a sporting event in New York.

Smarty Jones carried a record-high $59,000,000 betting pool for the Preakness Stakes, which doubled in amount during the Belmont Stakes.

The Belmont was Smarty Jones&#x27; only loss out of nine starts and the first time he had ever been passed in a race. Many speculated against his distance abilities. Although he ranked among the most brilliantly fast 2 and 3 year olds of recent years, the -mile distance of the Belmont might have proven too far for his miler/sprinter pedigree and running style. Failing to relax as he had done in the Derby and Preakness, he set a blistering pace on the front end. Birdstone, with a more distance-favoring pedigree, rallied from well off the pace, and for the first time in his career Smarty Jones was passed in a race. In many ways, his career mirrored that of Majestic Prince, who fell short of winning the 1969 Triple Crown. Both horses entered the Belmont undefeated, finished second, and never raced again. In Majestic Prince&#x27;s case though, it was a problem in his right front tendon, called a check ligament, that prevented him from racing again. 

Smarty Jones was voted the 2004 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse and was one of the top 5 searched words/terms on Google for that year.

Quote by Smarty Jones&#x27; stable foreman, &quot;Big Bill&quot; Foster: &quot;Number one in horse racing, you have to have the horse. Number two, you have to know what to do with the horse once you have him. A lot of people in this business have a lot of horses, and never made it because they broke them down. It happens a lot. Mismanaged. Mistrained. All because people want to be in the limelight. Which is where we&#x27;re different. We don&#x27;t want to be in the limelight.&quot;

==Stud career==
The end of his racing career was announced on August 2, 2004, due to chronic bruising of his ankle bones. Smarty Jones finished his career with 8 wins and one place in nine starts, earning $2,613,155. He also earned a $5 million bonus from Oaklawn Park. His total earnings were $7,613,155.

Smarty Jones stood at stud at Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, Kentucky, and at one point occupied the same stall that had previously housed Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew. Smarty Jones&#x27; first foals were born in 2006 and began racing in 2008. He now stands at Rodney Eckenrode&#x27;s Equistar Farm near Annville, Pa. and has sired numerous stakes winners, many graded, including Grade I winner Centralinteligence (bred by Pat Chapman, breeder/owner of Smarty Jones), Singapore Derby winning filly Better Life, Japanese record setter Keiai Gerbera, Panama Champion Smart DNA, Uruguayan Champion 2 years Bamba y Bamba and Backtalk, winner of the 2009 GIII Bashford Manor Stakes at Churchill Downs and GII Sanford Stakes at Saratoga Racecourse and a stallion at Bridlewood in Florida, to name a few.

He now has an early Kentucky Derby prep at Oaklawn named in his honor, the Smarty Jones Stakes, as well as a Labor Day race at Parx Racing and Casino that was inaugurated in 2010 as a replacement for the Pennsylvania Derby, which moved to the final Saturday in September. In addition, a statue will stand at Parx in his honor.

For the 2016 breeding season, Smarty Jones was relocated to Calumet Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, after shipping to Uruguay for the Southern Hemisphere season. Smarty Jones had his first grade I winner with Centralinteligence who won the 2013 GI Triple Bend Handicap.

Nasa won the Pennsylvania Nursery Stakes in 2014, the same race his sire Smarty Jones won in 2003.

<text>Jonathan Ormond Torrens (born October 2, 1972) is a Canadian actor and television personality best known for his co-hosting of &quot;Street Cents&quot;, his talk show &quot;Jonovision&quot;, and his role as &quot;J-Roc&quot; in the popular Canadian mockumentary &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;. In October 2009, Torrens began hosting &quot;TV with TV&#x27;s Jonathan Torrens&quot;, a comedic newsmagazine program broadcast on the TVtropolis network. In January 2014, he teamed up with fellow Canadian Jeremy Taggart to create the Taggart and Torrens Podcast. They discuss everything from sports to politics and offer a unique perspective on current issues. He was on the Canadian TV show Mr. D with Gerry Dee

==Early life==
Torrens was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. As a child, he lived in Sherwood where he attended Sherwood Elementary School. He made his first stage appearance there in Grade 1. In 1983, after first attending Charlottetown Rural High School in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, he moved to Halifax with his family, where he attended St. Patrick&#x27;s High School. His sister is actress and playwright Jackie Torrens.

==Career==
Torrens&#x27;s past work includes co-hosting CBC Television&#x27;s teen-oriented consumer affairs series &quot;Street Cents&quot; from 1989 until 1996. He then went on to host, co-produce and write for his own teen-oriented talk show, &quot;Jonovision&quot;, from 1996 until 2001.

In 1998, he played David in &quot;Beefcake&quot;, a movie about 1950s muscle magazines and their connection with the gay community. The same year, he won a Gemini in the category of Best Short Dramatic Program for his work on &quot;Nan&#x27;s Taxi&quot;. In 1999, he hosted and narrated a 33-minute docudrama on the consequences of impaired driving for the Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission (AADAC) called &quot;When Choices Collide&quot;. In 2001 he played Tony Moressa on the show &quot;Pit Pony&quot; and had two appearances on &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; as &#x27;The Clean Cut Keen SportsNet Guy&#x27;.

In 2003, Torrens played the role of Shane McKay, Emma Nelson&#x27;s biological father, in a two-part episode of &quot;,&quot; a revival of the teen drama &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, as original actor Bill Parrott declined to reprise the role. Torrens had previously reunited the original &quot;Degrassi&quot; cast in 1999 on &quot;Jonovision&quot;, which became the show&#x27;s highest rated episode and is regarded as a catalyst for &quot;Degrassi&quot;&#x27;s revival.

Torrens has a recurring role as J-Roc on the television series &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;. He also appeared in all of the &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; movies. In November and December 2008, Jonathan was the guest host of several episodes of the CBC radio show &quot;Definitely Not the Opera&quot;.

In 2008, he appeared in the award-winning short film &quot;Treevenge&quot;, directed by Jason Eisener.

In 2009, Torrens debuted in his own television show called &quot;TV With TV&#x27;s Jonathan Torrens&quot; on Canadian specialty network TVtropolis and ended in 2011. As of 2010, Torrens is one of the co-hosts of the reality television series &quot;Wipeout Canada&quot;, which also airs on TVtropolis that ended after 13 episodes.

On March 21, 2013, it was confirmed on Facebook that Torrens had gained forty pounds to reprise his role as J-Roc in the third Trailer Park Boys film, &quot;Don&#x27;t Legalize It&quot;. Torrens appeared in Season 8 of &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;, which debuted on Netflix on September 5, 2014.

He has also had regular roles in the television series &quot;Mr. D&quot;, &quot;Call Me Fitz&quot;, &quot;Game On&quot;, and &quot;Letterkenny&quot;.

In October 2017, Jeremy Taggart and Torrens released the paperback book &quot;Canadianity: Tales From The true North Strong And Freezing&quot;, &quot;a collection of showbiz tales from the road and relatable everyday anecdotes, all wrapped up in a nostalgic fondness for this great country. Canadianity takes readers on a cross-country journey, shining the spotlight on notable local heroes (or bands), the best places to crush food and the greasiest watering holes, coast to coast to coast.&quot;

In 2019, Torrens launched the financial education web series &quot;Your Two Cents&quot;.

In 2021, Torrens wrote, directed and starred in &quot;Vollies&quot;, a sitcom about volunteer firefighters for Bell Aliant&#x27;s Bell Fibe on-demand service. The series debuted on October 20, 2021.

<doc id="630182" wikidata="Q770291" url="?curid=630182" title="List of NHL seasons">
<text>This is a list of [[Season (sport)|seasons]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), a professional ice hockey league, since its inception in 1917. The list also includes the seasons of the National Hockey Association (NHA), the predecessor organization of the NHL, which had several teams that would continue play in the NHL. Only two franchises, the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs (formerly the Arenas and St. Patricks), still exist from the founding of the league. The Quebec Bulldogs, which suspended after the last NHA season, returned to play in the third NHL season, although they were considered founding members of the NHL. The league would move the team to Hamilton in 1920 and dissolve the team in 1925. The original Ottawa Senators would continue in the league until 1935, where, after one season in St. Louis as the St. Louis Eagles, the franchise was dissolved by the league. The current Ottawa Senators franchise does recognize the history of the original Senators (through retired numbers and a heritage jersey).The list is sub-divided using the same eras as the series of articles on the history of the National Hockey League.

==Championship format==
Like predecessor leagues, the champion of the NHA league since its founding was the team with the best regular season record, with a playoff used only if more than one team had the best win–loss record. This changed in 1917 with the invention of the split-season, whereby the champion became the winner of the annual playoff. The NHL continued the split-season and playoff format upon the winding up of the NHA organization. Except for the 1919–20 season, when there was no playoff because Ottawa won both halves of the season, the champion of the NHL has been the playoff champion.

The NHA champion was awarded the O&#x27;Brien Cup. This was continued by the NHL. Until 1927, the NHL champion was awarded the O&#x27;Brien Cup, supplemented by the Prince of Wales Trophy, starting in 1925. To win the Stanley Cup, the NHL champion had to play and win a &quot;world&#x27;s series&quot; with the champion of the Pacific Coast or Western Canada leagues. After 1927, the NHL playoff champion was awarded the Stanley Cup, while the O&#x27;Brien Cup and Prince of Wales Trophy were reused as division championship and playoff runner-up awards.

==1910–1917: National Hockey Association==

Hockey seasons traditionally started in January and ended in March until the 1910–11 season which was the first to start before the new year. The 1911–12 season saw the elimination of the &quot;rover&quot; position, reducing number of skaters per side to six, and changing the game to three 20-minute periods from two 30-minute periods. The 1916–17 season saw the introduction of the split schedule, an innovation attributed to Toronto NHA owner Eddie Livingstone. To symbolize the league championship, the NHA champion was awarded the O&#x27;Brien Cup, donated by the O&#x27;Brien family, owners of silver mines (being the source of the silver in the trophy), owners of several of the NHA franchises, and original owner of the Montreal Canadiens.

;Notes
1. All champion teams are also Stanley Cup champions unless marked.
2. The league did not use tiebreakers to determine the top record. The two teams played off to determine the championship.
3. Toronto and Battalion did not participate in the second half.
4a. No Finals prior to 1914; Stanley Cup awarded to league winners and defended on a challenge basis.
4b. Finals in 1915 and 1916 contested between top two teams of regular season.
4c. Finals from 1917 through 1921 contested between qualifier from first half-season and qualifier from second half-season.

==1917–1942: Early years==

The NHL started with three of the six NHA clubs (Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers and Ottawa Senators) and a Toronto franchise run by the Toronto Arena Co., which leased the players of the Toronto Blueshirts. Almost immediately after starting the season, the Wanderers folded, leaving three teams to complete the season. The same three teams returned for 1918–19 before Quebec &#x27;returned&#x27; for 1919–20, moving to Hamilton the following year. The same four-team configuration lasted until 1924–25 when the Montreal Maroons and the Boston Bruins joined the league. Expansion into other cities followed, lasting until the 1930s, when several teams folded.

The new NHL did not have a championship trophy at first. The O&#x27;Brien Cup was revived in November 1921, and served as the league championship trophy until 1927. The new Prince of Wales Trophy, donated in 1925, was also given to the league champion until 1927. Henceforth, the trophies were designated for divisional championships, and the Stanley Cup became the de facto league championship trophy.


;Notes
1. All champion teams are also Stanley Cup champions unless marked.
4c. Finals from 1917 through 1921 contested between qualifier from first half-season and qualifier from second half-season.
5. Wanderers withdrew after six games (four completed, two forfeited).
6. The Quebec Bulldogs started play.
7. No playoffs.
8. The Montreal Maroons and Boston Bruins started play.
9. The New York Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates started play. Hamilton Tigers dissolved.
10. The Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Cougars and New York Rangers started play.
11. The Ottawa Senators and Philadelphia Quakers suspended operations for the season.
12. The Ottawa Senators resumed play.
13. The St. Louis Eagles were dissolved.
14. The Montreal Maroons were dissolved.

==1942–1967: Original Six era==

Prior to the 1942–43 season, the New York Americans suspended operations. This reduced the number of teams to six, starting the &#x27;Original Six&#x27; era. During the Original Six era, the NHL played in a single six-team division. Each season, four of the six teams qualified for the playoffs to determine the Stanley Cup and NHL champion.

==1967–1992: Expansion era==

Since 1967, the league re-organized several times as it grew. In 1967, the league played in two divisions, with the playoff winner of each division playing off for the NHL championship. As the league grew the league changed its championship format to allow cross-over seeding, then changed to a division-based championship, leading to conference-based championship, with conference champions playing off for the Stanley Cup. In 1985, the Presidents&#x27; Trophy was inaugurated to reward the team with the top regular season record, irrespective of division or conference.

;Notes
15. The California Seals, Los Angeles Kings, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Minnesota North Stars and St. Louis Blues started play.
16. The Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks started play.
17. The Atlanta Flames and New York Islanders started play.
18. The Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals started play.

22. The Atlanta Flames relocated to Calgary, Alberta, renamed Calgary Flames.
23. The Colorado Rockies relocated to East Rutherford, New Jersey, renamed New Jersey Devils.
24. The San Jose Sharks started play.

==1992–2017: Further expansion==

In 1993, coinciding with the naming of Gary Bettman as commissioner, the league re-organized into the Eastern and Western Conferences, with two divisions each, organized along geographical lines. The playoff format was changed to provide conference champions without divisional playoff champions. A new round of expansion began. By 2000–01, the number of teams increased to 30 and the number of divisions increased to six. This era has seen three seasons changed due to labour disputes between the NHL and the players&#x27; union. The 1994–95 and 2012–13 seasons were shortened to 48 intraconference games, and the 2004–05 season&#x27;s games were cancelled entirely. According to the 2011 NHL Guide and Record Book, the NHL includes the 2004–05 season in its count of seasons. For example, the 2011 NHL Guide lists the Tampa Bay Lightning as entering their 19th &#x27;NHL Season&#x27;, although a count of the Lightning&#x27;s seasons of play would determine the 2010–11 season to be their 18th season of play.

==2017–present: Modern era==
The league began its second century in 2017 and has continued to grow by adding two new expansion franchises. It has also seen one of its teams indefinitely suspend operations, with the team&#x27;s hockey assets, including its roster and coaches, being transferred to a third expansion franchise.

This era has seen two seasons changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019–20 season was stopped at 68–71 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and resulted in a one-time playoff format change involving 24 teams; the subsequent 2020–21 season was shortened to 56 intradivisional games, with teams temporarily realigned and the playoff format modified.

==All-time top regular season record holders==
This table lists the number of times that NHL/NHA teams had the top record in the regular season (this list does not count Stanley Cup/League Champion wins). The Presidents&#x27; Trophy is the current award for the team with the best regular season record, which began being awarded starting with the NHL season. From 1938 to 1967 the Prince of Wales Trophy was the award for the team with the best record in the regular season. Following the expansion of no award was given until the inception of the Presidents&#x27; Trophy.
;Notes
:Defunct teams denoted in &quot;italics&quot;.
: The Montreal Canadiens and &quot;Ottawa Senators (original)&quot; each have 2 top regular season records in the NHA in addition to their NHL seasons.
