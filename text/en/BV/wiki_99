<text>Deinonychosauria is a clade of paravian dinosaurs which lived from the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous periods. Fossils have been found across the globe in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and Antarctica, with fossilized teeth giving credence to the possibility that they inhabited Australia as well. This group of dinosaurs are known for their sickle-shaped toe claws and features in the shoulder bones.

Deinonychosauria is commonly defined as all dinosaurs more closely related to dromaeosaurids (such as &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus)&quot; than to birds (such as &quot;Passer domesticus&quot;). It traditionally includes the families Dromaeosauridae and Troodontidae, which each possess enlarged &quot;sickle claws&quot;. However, troodontids may instead be closer to birds than to dromaeosaurids, so they would lie outside Deinonychosauria under that hypothesis. This would also render Deinonychosauria equivalent to Dromaeosauridae, under a broad definition of the family. As the structure of the paravian family is still undergoing debate, the components of Deinonychosauria is unstable beyond dromaeosaurids.

==Systematics==
In 1866 Ernst Haeckel created the now-deprecated subclass of birds known as Sauriurae (meaning &quot;lizard tails&quot; in Greek). It was intended to include &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and distinguish it from all other birds then known, which he grouped in the sister-group Ornithurae (&quot;bird tails&quot;). The distinction Haeckel referred to in this name is that &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; possesses a long, reptile-like tail, while all other birds known to him had short tails with few vertebrae, fused at the end into a pygostyle. The unit was not much referred to, and when Hans Friedrich Gadow in 1893 erected Archaeornithes for basically the same fossils, this became the common name for the early reptile-like grade of birds. This was followed by Alfred Romer (1933) and subsequent authors through most of the 20th century. According to Romer, the Archaeornithes are characterised by having clawed wings, a reptilian style ribcage without a large carina and the presence of a long, bony tail. The known members of the group by the time of its erection were &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Archaeornis&quot;. The two are now thought to represent a single species, &quot;Archaeopteryx lithographica&quot;, the &quot;Archaeornis&quot; being the Berlin specimen of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;.
 It was in 1888 the German anatomist Max Fürbringer created the order Archaeopterygiformes, though the unit was not used as much as Archaeornithes. Due to the popularity of Archaeornithes as well as Archaeopterygidae being recognized as the only family in this clade, Sauriurae, Archaeornithes, and Archaeopterygiformes are considered to be redundant arbitrary names that can be synonymous.

During the dinosaur renaissance the American palaeontologist John Ostrom had published a series of papers arguing that birds are highly derived dinosaurs, after comparisons between the then-newly discovered &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and noting their similarities in the wrist and shoulder bones. In his 1988 book &quot;Predatory Dinosaurs of the World&quot;, Gregory S. Paul classified dromaeosaurids in Archaeopterygidae. Paul states that:
Many theropods have been united into new groups... but the placement of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and the sickle-clawed dromaeosaurs in the same family is by far the most radical–yet it is also one of the most necessary... how alike, in detail after detail, dromaeosaurs and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; were.

The name Deinonychosauria was coined by Ned Colbert and Dale Russell in 1969, and defined as a clade (all theropods closer to dromaeosaurids than to birds) by Jacques Gauthier in 1986. Through the early 2000s, the consensus among paleontologists was that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to the troodontids, and with the troodontids, deinonychosaurians were turned into the sister taxon to avialans, and therefore the closest relatives of avialan birds. In 2012, Turner &quot;et al.&quot; conducted a phylogenetic analysis (using a dataset of 474 characters scored for 111 taxa) which found Deinonychosauria to be monophyletic.

However, several more recent studies have cast doubt on the hypothesis that dromaeosaurids and troodontids were more closely related to each other than either was to birds. A more robust 2013 study by Godefroit &quot;et al.&quot; (using a dataset of 1,500 characters scored for 358 taxa) found that troodontids were possibly more closely related to birds than to dromaeosaurids; forcing troodontids to remain in a monophyletic Deinonychosauria required four extra steps in the analysis, making this result less likely, but not implausible. Because Deinonychosauria was originally defined as all animals closer to dromaeosaurids than to birds without specific reference to troodontids, Deinonychosauria is a synonym of Dromaeosauridae if Troodontidae is closer to birds.

With the description in 2019 of the Late Jurassic genus &quot;Hesperornithoides&quot;, Hartman &quot;et al.&quot;, using every named Mesozoic maniraptoromorph (with the addition of 28 unnamed specimens), which they scored 700 characters and 501 operational taxonomic units, found that most of the anchiornithids are members of Archaeopterygidae, Halszkaraptorinae and Unenlagiinae are in a redefined family Unenlagiidae, and a Dromaeosauridae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; is the sister taxon of Troodontidae. The authors opted for Deinonychosauria (defined as dinosaurs closer to &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot; than to &quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) over &quot;Archaeopterygiformes&quot;.

In a study conducted in 2020, &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; was recovered as an avialan.

==Description==
Like other theropods, deinonychosaurs were bipedal; that is, they walked on their two hind legs. However, whereas most theropods walked with three toes contacting the ground, fossilized footprint tracks confirm that most deinonychosaurs held the second toe off the ground in a hyperextended position, with only the third and fourth toes bearing the weight of the animal. This is called functional didactyly. The enlarged second toe bore an unusually large, curved sickle-shaped claw (held off the ground or &#x27;retracted&#x27; when walking). This claw was especially large and flattened from side to side in the large-bodied predatory eudromaeosaurs. The first toe (hallux) was relatively small and angled inward toward the center of the body, but was not fully reversed as in modern birds.

The teeth of deinonychosaurs were curved and serrated, but not blade-like except in some advanced species such as &quot;Dromaeosaurus albertensis&quot;. The serrations on the front edge of deinonychosaur teeth were very small and fine, while the back edge had serrations which were very large and hooked. Deinonychosaurs generally had long, winged forelimbs, though these were smaller in some troodontids. The wings usually bore three large, flexible claws.

Most deinonychosaurs seem to have been predatory, though some smaller species especially among the troodontids are known to have been at least omnivorous.

==Claw function==
One of the best-known features of deinonychosaurs is the presence of an enlarged and strongly curved &quot;sickle claw&quot; on a hyper-extendible second toe, modified to hold the sickle claw clear of the ground when walking. While this characteristic claw and its associated modifications to the anatomy of the foot (such as a shortened metatarsus in eudromaeosaurs) had been known since the mid-20th century, their possible functions were the subject mainly of speculation, and few actual studies were published. Initial speculation regarded the claws as slashing implements used to disembowel large prey. In this scenario, the shortened upper foot would serve as an anchor point for powerful tendons to improve kicking ability. However, subsequent studies of the actual claw shape showed that the underside of the claw was only weakly keeled and would not have been an effective cutting instrument. Instead, it appeared to be more of a hooking implement. Manning et al. suggested in 2006 that the claws were similar to crampons and were used for climbing, and in the case of larger species or individuals, climbing up the flanks of very large prey.

A larger study of deinonychosaur claw function, published in 2011 by Fowler and colleagues, concluded that the earlier study by Manning and colleagues was correct and that the &quot;sickle claws&quot; of deinonychosaurs would have been ineffective as cutting weapons. They compared the claw and overall foot anatomy of various deinonychosaurs with modern birds to shed light on their actual function. Fowler and colleagues showed that many modern predatory birds also have enlarged claws on the second toes. In modern raptors, these claws are used to help grip and hold prey of sizes smaller than or equal to the predator, while the birds use their body weight to pin their prey to the ground and eat it alive. Fowler and colleagues suggested that this behavior is entirely consistent with the anatomy of advanced deinonychosaurs like &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, which had slightly opposing first toes and strong tendons in the toes and foot. This makes it likely that advanced dromaeosaurids also used their claws to puncture and grip their prey to aid in pinning it to the ground, while using shallow wing beats and tail movements to stabilize themselves. Other lines of evidence for this behavior include teeth which had large, hooked serrations only on the back edge (useful in pulling flesh upward rather than slicing it) and large claws on the wings (for greater maneuvering of prey while mantling it with the wings).

In more primitive dromaeosaurids and in troodontids, the feet were not as specialized and the claws were not as large or as hooked. Additionally, the toe joints allowed more range of motion than the simple up-down movements of advanced dromaeosaurids. This makes it likely that these species specialized in smaller prey that could be pinned using only the inner toes, not requiring the feet to be as strong or sturdy.

<text>Aplysiidae is the only family in the superfamily Aplysioidea, within the clade Anaspidea. These animals are commonly called sea hares because, unlike most sea slugs, they are often quite large, and when they are underwater, their rounded body shape and the long rhinophores on their heads mean that their overall shape resembles that of a sitting rabbit or hare. Sea hares are however sea snails with shells reduced to a small plate hidden between the parapodia, and some species are extremely large. The Californian black sea hare, &quot;Aplysia vaccaria&quot; is arguably the largest living gastropod species, and is certainly the largest living heterobranch gastropod.

== Description ==

Members of the Aplysiidae have an atrophied inner shell (in contrast with the nudibranchs, which have no shell at all). In &quot;Aplysia&quot; and &quot;Syphonota&quot;, this shell is a soft flattened plate over the visceral rear end, where it is fully or partially enclosed in the mantle skin. In &quot;Dolabella auricularia&quot;, the shell is ear-shaped. The shell is only present in the larval stage of the two genera &quot;Bursatella&quot; and &quot;Stylocheilus&quot;, and on this basis they have been grouped into the subfamily Dolabriferinae.

They are rather large animals. Their length can reach up to 75 cm (&quot;Aplysia vaccaria&quot;), and they can weigh well over 2 kg. They are cosmopolitan and found in temperate and tropical seas, inhabiting shallow coastal areas and sheltered bays, thick with vegetation.

The Aplysiidae are herbivorous, eating a variety of red, green or brown algae and eelgrass. Their color is diet-derived from the pigments of the algae. They concentrate the toxins found on algae.

== Defenses ==
Some species spout ink when disturbed or attacked, and they may also swim (rather than crawl) away, using their broad wing-like flaps or parapodia. The ink is extracted from their algal food, rather than being synthesized.

Sea hares have two main secretory glands in their mantle cavity. 
* purple gland: lying on top of the mantle cavity, above the gill. It gives off a red or purple fluid, or, in some species, a white ink.
* opaline gland: situated on the floor of the mantle cavity, beneath the gill. It gives off a white opaque secretion.

The genus &quot;Aplysia&quot; has proved useful as a model in neurobiology for the study of electrical synapses, which mediate the release of the clouds of ink.

== Mating habits ==
Sea hares are hermaphrodites, with fully functional male and female reproductive organs. 
The penis is on the right side of the head while the vagina is situated in the mantle cavity, beneath the shell, deep down between the parapodia. It is therefore physically impossible for mating partners to act as both male and female at the same time.

They have unusual mating habits: they can mate in pairs with one acting as a male, the other as a female, but they commonly occur in quite crowded numbers during the mating season, and this often leads to chains of three or more sea hares mating together. The one at the front acts as a female and the one at the back as a male. The animal(s) in between are acting as both males and females, in other words, the animal receiving sperm passes its own sperm to a third sea hare.

== Predators ==
Predators include pycnogonid sea spiders, wrasses and sea turtles.

== Laboratory use ==
Following the lead of Ladislav Tauc and his pupil Eric R. Kandel, &quot;Aplysia&quot; has been studied as a model organism by neurobiologists, because its gill and siphon withdrawal reflex, as studied in &quot;Aplysia californica&quot;, is mediated by electrical synapses, which allow several neurons to fire synchronously. This quick neural response is necessary for a speedy reaction to danger by the animal. &quot;Aplysia&quot; has only about 20,000 neurons, making it a favorite subject for investigation by neuroscientists. Also, the &#x27;tongue&#x27; on the underside is controlled by only two neurons, which allowed complete mapping of the innervation network to be carried out.

== Taxonomy ==
A 2004 study has shown that Aplysiidae is a monophyletic taxon with two distinct clades: Aplysiinae and Dolabellinae + Dolabriferinae + Notarchinae.

The authority of this family is still somewhat in dispute. The family was incorrectly originally spelled as Laplysiana. This was a Latinized form of the original common name &quot;les Laplysiens&quot; as described in &quot;Philosophie zoologique&quot;, 1:320 by Lamarck in 1809. Rafinesque introduced the new name Laplysinia in 1815. In 2001 Bouchet &amp; Rocroi advocated the attribution of the name Aplysiidae to Lamarck.

<text>Kentucky Horse Park is a working horse farm, international equestrian competition venue, and an educational theme park opened in 1978 in Lexington, Kentucky. It is located off Kentucky State Highway 1973 (Iron Works Pike) and Interstate 75, at Exit 120, in northern Fayette County in the United States. The equestrian facility is a park dedicated to &quot;man&#x27;s relationship with the horse.&quot; Open to the public, the park has a twice daily Horses of the World Show, showcasing both common and rare horses from around the globe. The horses are ridden in authentic costume. Each year the park is host to a number of special events and horse shows.

Additionally, the park contains the International Museum of the Horse, a Smithsonian Affiliate, which has a permanent collection of horse history and memorabilia, along with a rotating historical collection focused on a particular theme. Past themes include A Gift from the Desert (Arabia), Imperial China, and All the Queen&#x27;s Horses (Britain).

Beginning with the 1979 arrival of Forego, one of the leading handicap horses of the 1970s, the Kentucky Horse Park has been home to some of the world&#x27;s greatest competition horses, including John Henry, Horse of the Decade for the 1980s and the top money-winning Thoroughbred gelding in racing history. With the exception of a few months in 1986, John Henry lived at the park from 1985 until his death in 2007, alongside other racing greats such as Forego and his fellow 1970s champion Bold Forbes, and more recent residents Cigar, voted Horse of the Decade for the 1990s, and Da Hoss, the first horse to win Breeders&#x27; Cup races in non-consecutive years. In late 2008, the champions Alysheba and Funny Cide became residents, but Alysheba died at the park in March 2009. 1994 Kentucky Derby winner, Go For Gin, became a resident of the barn in 2011, while Cigar died at the park in 2014.

Besides Thoroughbred horses, Standardbred pacing greats such as Staying Together and Western Dreamer, Cam Fella (deceased) and Rambling Willie (deceased), and Standardbred trotting champion Mr. Muscleman have made the Kentucky Horse Park their home, as well as 5-gaited American Saddlebred geldings CH Gypsy Supreme, CH Imperator and CH Sky Watch (all deceased).

==Park sculptures==
A number of horse sculptures stand in the Kentucky Horse Park, including a Man o&#x27; War statue on a pedestal near the entrance, over the horse&#x27;s grave, which was moved here from Faraway Farm during the establishment of the park in the 1970s. There is also a life-size statue of the 1973 U.S. Triple Crown winner Secretariat with jockey Ron Turcotte aboard being led by groom Eddie Sweat, sculpted by Jim Reno. From harness racing, there is a statue of Bret Hanover.

==Kentucky Horse Park&#x27;s National Horse Center==

==2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games==

On December 6, 2005, it was announced that Lexington and the Kentucky Horse Park would host the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games in September and October. The 2010 games marked the first time the games were held outside of Europe; additionally, the eight Olympic-level world championships had never been held together in a single location within Europe.

As part of the games, several improvements to the park were slated:
* The $36 million Alltech Arena was approved in 2006 by the Kentucky General Assembly (legislature).
* Enhancements to the arena&#x27;s sound system.
* A resort hotel was planned to be constructed near the park.

On February 1, 2007, Governor Ernie Fletcher announced that he would seek an additional $38.3 million in improvements to the park in preparation for the games and other major horse events. In his address to the 2007 General Assembly the governor suggested:
* $24 million for a new outdoor stadium that would feature 10,075 permanent seats but could be expanded to 30,325 temporarily for major events.
* $4 million for an additional of exhibition space for vendors.
* $10.3 million for roadway improvements inside the park that would give the facility a second entrance via the campground. A wide loop road would be constructed so that events could be held on both sides of the horse park.

===Funding===

The new indoor stadium and additional exhibition space, costing $28 million, would be financed with 20-year bonds. The roadway improvements, at $10.3 million within the park, would come from the state highway fund. The resort hotel would be constructed and financed without state funds.

==Administration==

Although the park is owned by the state government, it is administered separately from the state park system.

<doc id="633102" wikidata="Q2553586" url="?curid=633102" title="Senchus fer n-Alban">
<text>The Senchus fer n-Alban (&quot;The History of the men of Scotland&quot;) is an Old Irish medieval text believed to have been compiled in the 10th century. It provides genealogies for kings of Dál Riata and a census of the kingdoms which comprised Dál Riata.

==Description==
The &quot;Senchus&quot; exists in a number of manuscripts, of which the most important belonged to Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and then to Edward Lhuyd. This, Ms. H.2.7 held by Trinity College Dublin, was compiled in the 14th century by Lúcás Ó Dalláin, probably working with Seán Mór Ó Dubhagáin (died 1372), the chief poet and historian of the Uí Maine. This manuscript was once thought to have formed part of the &quot;Book of Uí Maine&quot;, but this is no longer considered plausible. Other examples are found in the &quot;Book of Ballymote&quot; (1384x1406), the &quot;Book of Lecan&quot; (before 1418), and in Mac Fhirbhisigh&#x27;s 17th-century genealogical compilations. 
It may have been derived from earlier documents of the 7th century which are presumed to have been written in Latin.

The &quot;Senchus&quot; is a relatively short document, around 70 or 80 lines of type depending on the variant used. To it is appended the &quot;Genelaig Albanensium&quot; which contains genealogies of Máel Coluim mac Cináeda and Causantín mac Cuilén, kings of Alba, and of Ainbcellach mac Ferchair and other Dál Riata kings.

Most versions of the &quot;Senchus&quot; follow the late myth of the Dál Riata origins by beginning with Eochaid Muinremar and the sons of Erc, Fergus Mór among them. Mac Fhirbhisigh&#x27;s own version of the &quot;Senchus&quot; traces Dál Riata to the Síl Conairi and Cairpre Riata (Rígfhota), son of Conaire Mór and/or Conaire Cóem, who may be the &quot;Reuda&quot; of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;. The &quot;Genelaig Albanensium&quot;, and the similar genealogies in the Rawlinson B 502 manuscript, make Cairpre Riata an ancestor in the tenth or fifteenth generation of Fergus Mór mac Eirc.

The historical value of the &quot;Senchus&quot; rests largely in its later sections, which include historical kings of Dál Riata — myth may end and history begin in the reign of Conall mac Comgaill in the middle of the 6th century. The last king who can be identified in the genealogies contained in the &quot;Senchus&quot; proper is Conall Crandomna, who died around 660.

The &quot;Senchus&quot; lists the divisions of Dál Riata—the Cenél nGabráin, the Cenél Loairn, and the Cenél nÓengusa—and their obligations for military service, apparently at a time when the Cenél Comgaill remained part of the Cenél nGabráin. These divisions need not be of great antiquity, and the lists provided are not without problems. The Senchus lists no kindreds or military obligations for the Irish lands, if any, which may have formed part of Dál Riata. One curious feature of the Senchus is the presence of Airgíalla in the lands of the Cenél Loairn. It is not apparent whether these represent settlers from Ireland, or simply people to whom the label &quot;additional clients&quot; was applied.

The &quot;Senchus&quot; lists what is believed to be the oldest reference to a naval battle in the British Isles. There is a brief record of an engagement between rival Dalriadan groups in 719.

<text>Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz (, born 13 September 1950) is a Polish politician who served as Prime Minister of Poland for a year from 7 February 1996 to 31 October 1997, after being defeated in the Parliamentary elections by the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS). He was born in Warsaw.

==Career==
Cimoszewicz was a member of the left-wing Democratic Left Alliance the leftist candidate in the Polish presidential election of 1990, receiving 9 percent of the vote.

Cimoszewicz was the Prime Minister of Poland from 1996 to late 1997. October 1996, he became the chairman (office in the rank of minister) of the newly established Committee for European Integration, responsible for preparing Poland for accession negotiations with the European Union. He held this position until 31 October 1997.

Cimoszewicz was the Foreign Minister of Poland in the governments of Leszek Miller (2001–2004) and Marek Belka (2004–2005). It was during this time that he, along with Leszek Miller, signed the Accession Treaty that paved way to Polish membership in the European Union.

Cimoszewicz was the speaker of the Sejm (lower chamber of the Polish parliament) from January to October 2005.

Cimoszewicz was for a time a candidate for the 2005 Polish presidential election; but he withdrew before the elections and promised to abandon politics.

On 28 June 2005, Cimoszewicz declared his intent to run for Polish President (see: Election 2005). He instantly became a leader in the polls. He ran previously in 1990 and received 9.21 percent of the vote. In 1990, Lech Wałęsa and Stan Tymiński went on to the second round. Cimoszewicz did not run in the years 1995 and 2000 giving way to his close colleague Aleksander Kwaśniewski who twice became president. His election committee was chaired by the wife of President Kwaśniewski, Jolanta Kwaśniewska.

On 9 July 2005, Cimoszewicz caused a major political uproar by refusing to testify in front of the Orlen commission. He accused seven of its eight members of being politically motivated, partial and bent on undermining his presidential bid. Constitutional experts are split on whether his move was constitutional or if Cimoszewicz broke the law. Fifty-eight percent of Poles disapproved of Cimoszewicz&#x27;s behaviour before the commission.

According to a poll by Rzeczpospolita, Cimoszewicz was a &quot;hands down&quot; leader on 5 July 2005:

* Cimoszewicz: 28%
* Kaczyński: 19%
* Lepper: 17%
* Religa: 15%
* Tusk: 11%
* Borowski: 5%

He was predicted to win the second round, independent of who was going to reach it from second place. The election was won by Lech Kaczyński.

Cimoszewicz returned to politics during the 2007 parliamentary election, when he won a Senate seat as an independent candidate. He kept his senator&#x27;s seat until the end of term in 2015. 

In 2009, he was one of two candidates to replace Terry Davis as Secretary General of the Council of Europe. However, in September 2009, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe elected candidate Thorbjørn Jagland as the new secretary general.

Since 2015 Cimoszewicz is workstream leader for the Agency for the Modernisation of Ukraine (AMU), where he is responsible for combatting corruption.

In the 2019 European Parliament election Cimoszewicz was elected as the MEP for the Warsaw constituency.

==On Ukraine==
In May 2014 Cimoszewicz told an audience that he was unhappy with the way the Russian annexation of Crimea was handled. &quot;The democratic West has so far not reacted in a proper way... If we do not stop that aggressive [Russian] policy at an early stage then we can face a much more difficult situation requiring more efforts taking higher risks... There is one element of that crisis which will be very difficult to be solved: the fate of Crimea.&quot;

<text>Stewart Elliott (born March 1, 1965) is a Canadian jockey in thoroughbred horse racing.

Elliott was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He grew up in horse racing; his father was a jockey for many years, his mother rode show horses and was a riding instructor, and his uncle owns a racing stable in Canada. At age seven, his family moved to race in Hong Kong, where they remained for six years before going to the United States. Stewart began riding professionally at age 16, mainly at Philadelphia Park Racetrack, a small racetrack in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He has been the racetrack&#x27;s most successful jockey for a number of years and for the past three seasons has been named Pennsylvania&#x27;s top rider. On May 13, 2003, he reached a prestigious milestone, riding his 3,000th career winner. On January 18, 2009, he won the 4,000th race of his career at Philadelphia Park.

On May 1, 2004, Elliott became the first jockey in twenty-five years to win the Kentucky Derby in his first appearance in the race. His horse, Smarty Jones, became the first unbeaten Derby winner since Seattle Slew in 1977. To add to his victory was Elliott&#x27;s 10% share of the almost $6 million in purse and bonuses that represented the largest payday for any jockey and horse in racing history. Two weeks later, Elliott rode Smarty Jones to a record-breaking win in the second leg of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, the Preakness Stakes. In the Belmont Stakes, the third leg, Elliott took Smarty Jones out early in the backstretch, and Birdstone passed him late in the race. Some have criticized Elliott&#x27;s ride, saying he &quot;pushed&quot; the horse too early in the race, but other experts have said: &quot;he was doing the only thing he could do to win the race.&quot;

During his breakthrough year in 2004, he won 262 races out of 1,363 mounts with earnings of $14,533,061.

In 2005, he won 143 races out of 860 mounts with earnings of $5,393,661.

On January 11, 2008, Elliott rode four winners on one racecard at Aqueduct Racetrack.

On June 1, 2010, Woodbine Entertainment announced that Elliott had been voted the Avelino Gomez Memorial Award for his contribution to the sport of Thoroughbred racing.

In 2017 Stewart Elliott was voted the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award, a prestigious honor voted on by thoroughbred horse racing jockeys in North America. It is given to a jockey who has demonstrated high standards of personal and professional conduct, on and off the racetrack.

On August 9, 2020, Elliot became the 36th North American jockey to have won more than 5,000 races.

<doc id="633113" wikidata="Q61282" url="?curid=633113" title="Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied">
<text>Prince Alexander Philipp Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied (23 September 1782 – 3 February 1867) was a German explorer, ethnologist and naturalist. He led a pioneering expedition to southeast Brazil between 1815 and 1817, from which the album &quot;Reise nach Brasilien,&quot; which first revealed to Europe real images of Brazilian Indians, was the ultimate result. It was translated into several languages and recognized as one of the greatest contributions to the European knowledge of Brazil at the beginning of the nineteenth century. In 1832 he embarked on another expedition, this time to the United States, together with the Swiss painter Karl Bodmer.
Prince Maximilian collected many examples of ethnography, and many specimens of flora and fauna of the area, still preserved in museum collections, notably in the Linden Museum, Stuttgart. The genus &quot;Neuwiedia&quot; Blume (Orchidaceae) was named for him. Also, Prince Maximilian is honored in the scientific names of eight species of reptiles: &quot;Hydromedusa maximiliani&quot;, &quot;Micrablepharis maximiliani&quot;, &quot;Bothrops neuwiedi&quot;, &quot;Polemon neuwiedi&quot;, &quot;Pseudoboa neuwiedi&quot;, &quot;Sibynomorphus neuwiedi&quot;, &quot;Xenodon neuwiedii&quot;, and &quot;Ramphotyphlops wiedii&quot;.

==Biography==
Wied was born in Neuwied, the grandson of the ruling count (after 1784 prince) Johann Friedrich Alexander of Wied-Neuwied. Born at the end of the European Enlightenment, Maximilian became friends with two of its major figures: Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, a major comparative anthropologist under whom he studied biological sciences, and Alexander von Humboldt, who served as Maximilian&#x27;s mentor. He joined the Prussian army in 1800 during the Napoleonic Wars, rising to the rank of major in the Zieten Hussars. He was given a leave of absence from the army in 1815 (prior to Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba).
Wied led an expedition to southeast Brazil from 1815 to 1817. In 1816 he found the tribe of the Botocudos, about which he gave exact details for the first time. On account of the war among the different tribes of the country he was obliged to abandon his original route and remained for some time near some ruins that he had come across. North of the Belmonte river he made his way through the woods, and after many difficulties arrived in the province of Minas Gerais. His delicate health forced him to abandon his expedition, and he was detained on unfounded suspicions for four days, and robbed of a large part of his collection of insects and plants. After this he resolved to leave the country, and embarked for Germany on 10 May 1817. On his return, he wrote &quot;Reise nach Brasilien&quot; (1820–21) and &quot;Beiträge zur Naturgeschichte von Brasilien&quot; (1825–33).

In 1832 he travelled to the Great Plains region of the United States, accompanied by the Swiss painter Karl Bodmer on a journey up the Missouri River, and wrote &quot;Reise in das Innere Nord-Amerikas&quot; (1840) on his return. During his travels, he was a sympathetic recorder of the cultures of many of the Native American tribes he encountered, notably the Mandan and the Hidatsa, who lived in settled villages on the banks of the Missouri, but also such nomadic peoples as the Sioux, Assiniboine, Plains Cree, Gros Ventres and Blackfoot. Bodmer&#x27;s watercolour paintings of individuals, artefacts and customs among the Indians are acknowledged as among the most accurate and informative ever made. Many were adapted as hand-coloured engravings to illustrate the publication of 1840.

In 1845, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

<doc id="633114" wikidata="Q131741" url="?curid=633114" title="Libjpeg">
<text>libjpeg is a free library with functions for handling the JPEG image data format. It implements a JPEG codec (encoding and decoding) alongside various utilities for handling JPEG data.
It is written in C and distributed as free software together with its source code under the terms of a custom permissive (BSD-like) free software license, which demands attribution.
The original variant is maintained and published by the Independent JPEG Group (IJG). Meanwhile, there are several forks with additional features.

JPEG JFIF images are widely used on the Web. The amount of compression can be adjusted to achieve the desired trade-off between file size and visual quality.

==Utilities==
The following utility programs are shipped together with libjpeg:
; cjpeg and djpeg: for performing conversions between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
; rdjpgcom and wrjpgcom: for inserting and extracting textual comments in JPEG files.
; jpegtran: for transformation of existing JPEG files.

===jpegtran===

The command-line program &quot;jpegtran&quot; provides several features for reformatting and recoding the representation of the DCT coefficients, for transformation of actual image data and for discarding auxiliary data in JPEG files, respectively. The transformations regarding the representation of the coefficients comprise:
* optimisation of the Huffman coding layer of a JPEG file to increase compression,
* conversion between progressive and sequential JPEG formats,
* conversion between Huffman and arithmetic coding in the entropy coding layer.
These transformations are each completely lossless and reversible. The transformations on the image data comprise:
* eliminate non-standard application-specific data inserted by some image programs,
* perform certain transformations on a file, such as:
** discarding of colour channels (conversion to greyscale),
** rotating and flipping in steps of 90 degrees,
** cropping or joining at image block borders (every 8×8 or 16×16 pixels),
** rescaling.
These are lossless and reversible only regarding the image data that is kept. Reencoding with repeated lossy quantisation of the image data (generation loss) does not take place.

==History==
The JPEG implementation of the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) was first publicly released on 7 October 1991 and has been considerably developed since that time.
The development was initially mainly done by Tom Lane.
The open-source implementation of the IJG was one of the major open-source packages and was key to the success of the JPEG standard. Many companies incorporated it into a variety of products such as image editors and web browsers.

For version 5, which was released on September 24, 1994, the whole code base was rewritten. It introduced the utility programs &quot;rdjpgcom&quot; and &quot;wrjpgcom&quot; for handling embedded text comments.
The version 6 from 2 August 1995 came with support for progressive JPEG and for the first time with the utility program &quot;jpegtran&quot;. This utility was extended with features to rotate and flip images and grayscale reduction in version 6b.

=== libjpeg-turbo and descendants ===

From version 6b of libjpeg of 27 March 1998, Miyasaka Masaru forked a branch named &quot;libjpeg/SIMD&quot;, which included x86 SIMD optimisations. It got substantial contributions from the TigerVNC and the VirtualGL projects in 2009. On that basis the libjpeg-turbo project was created in 2010.

On 4 March 2014, the first version of the filesize-optimising fork &quot;MozJPEG&quot; was published. For this version Josh Aas from Mozilla Research reworked the Perl script &quot;jpegcrush&quot; from x264&#x27;s main developer Loren Merritt and integrated it into the code base of libjpeg-turbo.

On 10 July 2014, Mozilla released version 2.0, which mainly added trellis quantisation and is now able to reduce the size of baseline JPEGs also. Facebook, Inc. donated for the development of the next version, and CloudFlare assigned a developer for the improvement of MozJPEG.

In 2019, libjpeg-turbo became the ISO and ITU endorsed reference implementation for the JPEG format.

In April 2024, Google introduced &quot;Jpegli&quot;, a new JPEG coding library that offers enhanced capabilities and a 35% compression ratio improvement at high quality compression settings, while the coding speed is comparable with MozJPEG.

=== Change in IJG leadership ===

After 11 years and a change in leadership, the IJG under Guido Vollbeding released new versions of libjpeg (7 through 9), of which each broke ABI compatibility with previous versions. The changes that were held in prospect after the 6x series were not delivered.
In version 7, support for arithmetic coding was introduced, which earlier has been rejected because of the patent situation, as well as the crop feature in jpegtran (codice_1).

Versions 8 and 9 served basically for the introduction of controversial incompatible format extensions. These are widely regarded as ineffective and inferior to existing, standardised solutions. Their standardisation was rejected after submission to the ITU-T. The original organiser Tom Lane and others criticize these changes as a break from the goals of the IJG.

==Versions==


==Forks==
Well-known forks are libjpeg-turbo, which optimises for speed of execution, and MozJPEG, which optimises for smaller file sizes.

There is also a similarly named library from the ISO, which aims to be a complete implementation of JPEG, JPEG XT and JPEG LS standards.

===libjpeg-turbo===
libjpeg-turbo is a fork of libjpeg that uses SIMD instructions to accelerate baseline JPEG encoding and decoding. Many projects are now using libjpeg-turbo instead of libjpeg, including popular Linux distributions (Fedora, Debian, Mageia, openSUSE, ...), Mozilla, and Chrome. Apart from performance, some projects have chosen to use libjpeg-turbo because it allows them to retain backward ABI compatibility with the older libjpeg v6b release. libjpeg v7, v8 and v9 broke ABI compatibility with prior releases.

libjpeg-turbo implements the standard-compliant arithmetic coding and lossless crop features seen in libjpeg v7. It can also be configured to be compatible with the libjpeg v7 or v8 ABI, but it does implement DCT scaling and the proprietary SmartScale, which builds on DCT scaling. libjpeg-turbo chooses not to support SmartScale, because it is not an ITU-T standard and because their own research finds it (and DCT scaling) ineffective. By extension, since the only major new feature in libjpeg v9 is specific to the SmartScale format, the libjpeg-turbo Project has chosen to forgo emulating libjpeg v9.

Since 2019, libjpeg-turbo is one of the two JPEG reference implementations, available as ISO/IEC 10918-7 and ITU-T T.873. The other reference implementation is ISO libjpeg which also includes support for JPEG XT and JPEG LS.

=== MozJPEG ===

MozJPEG is a fork from libjpeg-turbo done by Josh Aas and others from Mozilla Research. It aims to speed up loading times of webpages by achieving a reduction in file size (of about 10%) and therefore transmission time through improvement of coding efficiency while retaining image quality. To achieve this, it uses more processing power for the encoding (asymmetry) while retaining full compatibility with the JPEG standard and requiring no changes on the decoder side.

The techniques MozJPEG uses to achieve high compression include optimising Huffman trees, using progressive coding to optimally split the spectrum of DCT coefficients into separate scans, and through the use of trellis quantisation. Additionally, the presets are aggressively tuned towards the minimisation of file sizes.

Besides libjpeg-turbo, MozJPEG also builds upon jpegcrush, a Perl script by Loren Merritt.

=== Jpegli ===

In April 2024, Google introduced &quot;Jpegli&quot;, a new JPEG coding library that offers enhanced capabilities and a 35% compression ratio improvement at high quality compression settings, while the coding speed is comparable with MozJPEG.

== ISO libjpeg ==
ISO/IEC Joint Photography Experts Group maintains a reference software implementation for base JPEG (ISO/IEC 10918-1 and 18477-1) and JPEG XT extensions (ISO/IEC 18477 Parts 2 and 6-9), as well as lossless JPEG-LS (ISO/IEC 14495). It also includes some of the optimizations of MozJPEG. Though also named libjpeg, it is not related to the source code provided by Independent JPEG Group (IJG) and does not support proprietary extensions introduced by IJG since 2007.

<doc id="633116" wikidata="Q763516" url="?curid=633116" title="Erispoe">
<text>Erispoe (; ; died 2 or 12 November 857) was Duke of Brittany from 851 to his death. After the death of his father Nominoe, he led a successful military campaign against the Franks, culminating in his victory at the Battle of Jengland. He is subsequently referred to as &quot;King of Brittany&quot;.

Erispoe&#x27;s recorded titles include (&quot;prince of the province of Brittany&quot;), (&quot;duke of the Bretons&quot;), and (&quot;usurping king of the Bretons&quot;). However, if Erispoe was usurping regality in Brittany at that time (857), it is not attested in other sources. It may imply continued Frankish resentment of the title. He is called (&quot;king of the Bretons&quot;) by Regino of Prüm (d. 915).

==War with the Franks==
Erispoe was born to Nominoe&#x27;s wife Argentaela, but the date of his birth is not known. He was involved in his father&#x27;s campaigns to take control of the Frankish counties of Rennes and Nantes. In 843, in alliance with Lambert II of Nantes, Erispoe took command of the Breton army while his father was ill. Lambert had been displaced as ruler of Nantes by Charles the Bald, king of West Francia, who had installed Renaud d&#x27;Herbauges in his place. Ambushed by Count Renaud, Erispoe was badly defeated at the initial engagement at Messac. However, the Brittons quickly rallied their troops and took the complacent Franks by surprise shortly thereafter at the Battle of Blain, inflicting a serious defeat resulting in the death of Count Renaud. 

Having regained his health, Nominoe took command once more. The victory at Blain having secured control of Nantes and Rennes, he raided into Frankish territory, defeating the Franks at the Battle of Ballon in 845. A truce followed, but after Charles regained control of Nantes, Nominoe and Erispoe renewed their offensive in 849. While on campaign, Nominoe died suddenly. Erispoe was proclaimed leader, but immediately after his father&#x27;s death, his power was challenged by Charles the Bald, still his nominal suzerain. Charles crossed the river Vilaine with an army. Erispoe defeated Charles in the decisive Battle of Jengland on 22 August 851.

==Treaty of Angers==
Erispoe met Charles in Angers (possibly in secret) in the days following the battle and concluded a peace treaty in return for being invested with the counties of Rennes and Nantes. South of the Loire, the &quot;Pays de Retz&quot; was detached from the County of Poitou and granted to him as well. Charles and Erispoe also created a baptismal alliance, whereby Charles stood as godfather at the baptism of Erispoe&#x27;s infant son Conan, but whether in 851 or 856 is unknown. Finally, in 851 Charles gave Erispoe royal regalia (robes at least) and Erispoe in turn pledged himself to Charles with the giving of hands and an oath of fidelity. Erispoe subsequently overate at the banquet given in his honour. 

According to the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot;, at Louviers in February 856 Erispoe&#x27;s daughter (unnamed in the sources) was betrothed to Charles&#x27;s young son, Louis the Stammerer, who was granted the &quot;ducatus Cenomannicus&quot; as subking of Neustria with Le Mans as his capital. With the consent of the Frankish magnates, Louis received the &quot;regnum Neustriae&quot; from his father:

&quot;Karlus rex cum Respogio Brittone paciscens, filiam eius filio suo Ludoico despondet, dato illi ducatu Cenomannico usque ad viam quae a Lotitia Parisiorum Cesaredunum Turonum ducit&quot;. 
&lt;br&gt;
King Charles, making peace with Erispoe of Brittany, the daughter of whom was betrothed to his son Louis, gave the duchy of Maine as far as the road from Paris to Tours as duke.

Erispoe was at peace with Charles for the whole of his reign after Jengland and he governed as a typical Carolingian regional official might, with the added dignity of a &quot;consors regni&quot; (royal consort). Erispoe&#x27;s use of a royal seal has led to the false belief that he was a king (&quot;rex&quot;), but in fact he probably received the right to use such a seal from Charles, who himself used an imperial seal.

==Later life==
Erispoe was a benefactor of the abbey of Redon, as his father had been; his power base lay in the Vannetais and southeast Brittany (even more easterly than his father). In 853 the town of Nantes was plundered by the Vikings. Erispoe launched a war against them but it came to an end when they departed a few years later.

=== Death and succession ===
In November 857 he was assassinated at the altar of a church, which was then considered a place of asylum, by his cousin and successor Salomon, aided by an obscure Almarchus (Almarus). He was buried at Redon Abbey.

==Family==
By his wife Marmohec (who predeceased him) he had at least two children, the aforementioned Conan and a girl, who eventually married Gurvand of Rennes.

<text>Salomon () (died 874) was count of Rennes and Nantes from 852 and duke of Brittany from 857 until his assassination in 874. In 867, he was granted the counties of Avranches and Coutances, and he used the title king of Brittany intermittently after 868.

In popular tradition within Brittany he was canonised as &quot;Saint Salomon&quot; after his death and raised to the rank of martyr.

==Rise under Erispoe==
Salomon was the son of Riwallon III of Poher, who himself was the son of Count Erispoë I of Poher, King of the Browaroch (775–812), and older brother of Nominoe. In 851, Charles the Bald, after his defeat at the Battle of Jengland, made peace with Salomon&#x27;s cousin Erispoe, son of Nominoe, and granted him the counties of Rennes and Nantes and the Pays de Retz in Poitou as far as the river Mayenne. In 852, Salomon swore an oath to Charles and became his loyal follower (&quot;fidelis&quot;); in return, in a manner similar to Erispoe, he was granted Rennes, Nantes, and Retz as a &quot;third&quot; of Brittany to be held from Charles in fee. He and Erispoe were the &quot;dominatores&quot; of Rennes in 853. Salomon was the most powerful aristocrat at Erispoe&#x27;s court.

==Revolt of 858–863==
Probably because he feared losing his benefices (which he held under Erispoe) if Louis the Stammerer were allowed to become king at Le Mans, Salomon colluded with the otherwise unknown Almarchus to assassinate his cousin Erispoe and seize the Breton throne in 857. In 858, he was behind the large-scale revolt of the Frankish nobles of Neustria against Charles the Bald. Bretons were involved in the chasing of Louis from Le Mans in the spring of that year. In September, Louis the German marched as far as Orléans, where a Breton delegation from Salomon met him and took oaths on Salomon&#x27;s behalf. In 859, a synod met at Savonnières near Toul and tried to order Salomon to remember his oath of 852 and to resume paying the tribute which Brittany had paid in years past.

By 862, Salomon was the centre of the revolt against Charles the Bald, though he had not made war on the king himself since 860. In that year he hired the services of a band of Vikings with which to fight Robert the Strong, who himself had hired mercenary Vikings to help him. Salomon also lent a force of Bretons to aid Louis the Stammerer, now in league with the rebels, in his war with Robert. In 863, Charles gathered an army and began marching on Brittany, but held off near Entrammes and negotiated a peace with Salomon whereby western Anjou was recognised as a part of Brittany and the lay abbacy of Saint-Aubin in Angers was granted to Salomon, who commended himself to Charles and paid tribute.

==Revolt of 865–867==
Salomon did not give up his war with Robert or his alliance with the Vikings quite so readily, however. In 865 and 866, the Vikings and Bretons ravaged the vicinity of Le Mans and Robert was killed in the Battle of Brissarthe against the Vikings allied with the Bretons. This was the start of a new insurrection; even Pope Nicholas I wrote letters to Salomon urging him to resume the halted tribute payments. Charles marched on Brittany in 867, but Salomon sent his son-in-law Pascweten to negotiate a peace at Compiègne in August. Charles sent hostages to Salomon and Pascweten swore oaths of fealty to Charles on Salomon&#x27;s behalf.

==Peace and regalia==
This peace was to last until the end of Salomon&#x27;s life. Charles rewarded his now faithful vassal with a gift of regalia in 868, including a golden, jewelled crown. It is also likely that Salomon&#x27;s two-year-old son Wigo was baptised on this occasion and that Charles acted as godfather to him, thus making Salomon and Charles linked by &quot;blood&quot; as co-fathers. Though Salomon thereafter began to call himself king, he was not king in any official capacity, as an eleventh-century historian at Redon monastery wrote:

Salomon was called king, not because it was true in fact, but because he wore a gold coronet and purple robes by a grant of the Emperor Charles, and for this reason was designated by this name.
Salomon expended some effort in the mid-860s trying to have Pope Nicholas send the pallium to the Bishop of Dol to create an archdiocese for all the Breton bishoprics, which did not recognise the Archdiocese of Tours, their legal metropolitan. Salomon may have wanted an archbishop which was pliable to his wishes or who could consecrate him as king. Perhaps he simply wished to break the deadlock which had ensued following Nominoe&#x27;s deposition of five Breton bishops a decade and a half earlier.

In 874, a conspiracy involving Pascweten, Wrhwant, and Wigo, son of Riwallon, Count of Cornouaille, plotted to kill Salomon. They succeeded in this, though they quickly fell out with each other and a civil war followed until 876.

== Veneration ==

Salomon III of Bretagne is honored in the Catholic Church on 25 June.

<text>Pascweten (died 876) was the count of Vannes and a claimant to the rule of Brittany. He was a son of Ridoredh of Vannes, a prominent and wealthy aristocrat first associated with the court of Erispoe in the 850s. He owned vast landed estates and salt works (as at Guérande) in southeastern Brittany and was a patron of Redon Abbey. 

Pascweten was a son-in-law of Salomon, Duke of Brittany, in August 867, when he negotiated a lasting peace at Compiègne with Charles the Bald on behalf of his father-in-law and prevented the king from marching on Brittany. Pascweten swore an oath of fidelity to Charles on Salomon&#x27;s behalf. 

In 874 Pascweten, Wrhwant, and Wigo, son of Riwallon, Count of Cornouaille, conspired against Salomon and assassinated him, but since each hailed from a different regional party, they soon found themselves at odds with Salomon gone. Pascweten and Wrhwant fought over the succession to Breton rule for the next two years. They divided the country between them, though Regino of Prüm records that the latter received a larger share. By mid 876 both were dead and Pascweten&#x27;s brother, Alan the Great, had succeeded him in Vannes and carried on the fight against Judicael of Cornouaille.

<text>Wrhwant, Gurwant, Gurwent or Gurvand () (died 876) was a claimant to the Kingdom of Brittany from 874 until his death in opposition to Pascweten, Count of Vannes.

Wrhwant was complicit in the conspiracy which assassinated Salomon in 874. However, he was of the faction which had been outside Salomon&#x27;s court and he hailed from northwest Brittany. He was, however, never styled &quot;Count&quot;. He mustered 200 men to fight the Vikings in 874. After Salomon&#x27;s death, he and Pascweten divided the country between them, though Regino of Prüm records that the latter received a larger share. The two soon fell out and fought over the succession. He had died by the middle of 876 and his son Judicael had taken up his role.

His wife was a daughter of Erispoe, and in some reconstructed genealogies their one daughter was married to Berengar of Rennes.

<doc id="633124" wikidata="Q561348" url="?curid=633124" title="Alan I, King of Brittany">
<text>Alan I (; died 907), called the Great, was the Count of Vannes and Duke of Brittany (&quot;dux Brittonium&quot;) from 876 until his death. He was probably also the only King of Brittany (&quot;rex Brittaniæ&quot;) to hold that title by a grant of the Emperor.

==Expulsion of Vikings==

Alan was the second son of Count Ridoredh of Vannes. He succeeded his brother Pascweten in Vannes when the latter died, probably in the middle of 876, and contended for leadership of Brittany with Judicael of Poher. Alan represented the power bloc of southeastern Brittany while Judicael represented western Breton interests. Eventually he and Judicael made peace in order to fight the Vikings. Judicael died in the Battle of Questembert in 888 or 889, after which Alan gained sole leadership of Brittany. In 890, Alan defeated the Vikings at Saint-Lô, chasing them into a river where many drowned.

==King of Brittany==

After the death of Judicael, Alan ruled all of Brittany as it had been during the time of Salomon. He ruled not only the Breton territories of Léon, Domnonée, Cornouaille, and the Vannetais, but also the Frankish counties of Rennes, Nantes, Coutances, and Avranches, as well as the western parts of Poitou (the so-called &quot;pays de Retz&quot;) and Anjou. In the east his rule extended as far as the river Vire. He was the first Breton ruler to rule this entire territory without great opposition within the west and the last to rule the whole bloc of Franco-Celtic countries. His strongest opponent was Fulk I of Anjou, who disputed control of the Nantais with him, though Alan seems to have had the upper hand in his lifetime. His power base remained in the southeast and he was powerful and wealthy in land in around Vannes and Nantes.

According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, after the death of Carloman II in 884, Charles the Fat succeeded to all of West Francia save Brittany, thus making Brittany an independent kingdom; but this does not seem to have been true. A charter datable to between 897 and 900 makes reference to the soul of &quot;Karolus&quot; on whose behalf Alan had ordered prayers to be said in the monastery of Redon. This was probably Charles the Fat, who, as emperor, probably granted Alan the right to be titled &quot;rex&quot;. As emperor he would have had that prerogative and he is known to have had contacts with Nantes in 886, making it not improbable that he came into communication with Alan. Charles also made a concerted effort to rule effectively in the entirety of his empire and to make former enemies, with dubious ties to the empire, like the Viking Godfrid, men of standing in return for their loyalty. Throughout his reign, Alan used Carolingian symbols of regalia and Carolingian forms in his charters. Alan augmented his power during the weak reigns of Odo and Charles III.

== Death and succession== 

Alan I died in 907. The succession was disputed and Count Gourmaëlon of Cornouaille seized the throne. Brittany was soon overrun by Vikings, who defeated and slew Gourmaëlon in battle in 913/914 and held the region until 936 when Alan I&#x27;s grandson Alan II returned to Brittany from exile in Æthelstan&#x27;s England, vanquished the Vikings, and succeeded in reestablishing Christian rule. However, Brittany&#x27;s geographic territory was never as extended as in Alan I&#x27;s time and no future Breton rulers were called kings until the Breton Ducal crown was merged with the French crown in the 16th century (q.v. List of rulers of Brittany).

== Reputed connection with House of Rennes ==

According to an 11th-century genealogy composed for the Count of Anjou, Alan I&#x27;s son, Pascweten the Younger, was the father of Judicael Berengar, whose son was Conan I of Rennes, founder of the House of Rennes.

==Children==
By his wife Oreguen, Alan had the following children:
*Pascweten (died c. 903), married Gerberga. An 11th-century collection of Angevin genealogies describes him as the father of Judicael Berengar.
*Guerec
*Budic
*Rudalt, Count of Vannes, fled the Viking invasion c. 919
*Daughter, name unknown, who married Mathuedoï I, Count of Poher, and was the mother of Alan II
*Daughter, name unknown, who married Tangui, Count of Vannes, died before 913

<doc id="633125" wikidata="Q1247912" url="?curid=633125" title="Mijwiz">
<text>The mijwiz (, DIN: &quot;miǧwiz&quot;) is a traditional Middle East musical instrument popular in Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Its name in Arabic means &quot;dual&quot;, because of its consisting of two, short, bamboo pipes with reed tips put together, making the mijwiz a double-pipe, single-reed woodwind instrument.

==Background==
The mijwiz consists of two pipes of equal length; each pipe has around five or six small holes for fingering. It requires a special playing technique known as &quot;circular breathing,&quot; which is tricky but produces a continuous tone, without pausing to take a breath. The mijwiz is played in the Levant as an accompaniment to either belly dancing or dabke, the folkloric line dance of the Levant. The mijwiz is most popular today in the Levant (Lebanon, Syria and Jordan). Many popular folk songs either include the mijwiz on recordings, or include the instrument&#x27;s name in the song&#x27;s lyrics. One example is the famous Lebanese dabke song &quot;Jeeb el Mijwiz ya Abboud&quot; () by the singer Sabah.

The mijwiz is also related to the arghul (or yarghoul), which consists of one short pipe with five to six holes and a longer pipe joined to it just like the mijwiz and produces a very similar sound to it.

The mijwiz like the argoul is related to ancestor of some types of bagpipes. However, in the case of the mijwiz, the cheeks of the player with their circular breathing act like the bag that contains the air in a bagpipe.

<text>Judicael (or Yezekael) (died 888 or 889) was the Duke of Brittany from 876 to his death. He was a son of a daughter of Erispoe and claimed Brittany after the death of the pretenders Wrhwant and Pascweten in mid 876.

During the reign of Salomon (857–874), Judicael controlled either all of Cornouaille or just Poher (&quot;Poucaer&quot;) with the title of &quot;princeps Poucher&quot;. He represented western Breton interests against those of the powerful rulers of Vannes, Pascweten and then Alan the Great, who opposed his claim to the Breton dukedom.

Judicael reconciled with Alan in order to fight the Vikings; together, they defeated them at the Battle of Questembert in 888 or 889, but Judicael died in the fighting.

<doc id="633128" wikidata="Q725368" url="?curid=633128" title="Alan II, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Alan II (c. 900–952), nicknamed Wrybeard or Twistedbeard, Alan Varvek in Breton, was Count of Vannes, Poher and Nantes, and Duke of Brittany from 938 to his death. He was the grandson of King Alan the Great by Alan&#x27;s daughter and her husband Mathuedoï I, Count of Poher.
He expelled the Vikings/Norsemen from Brittany after an occupation that lasted from 907 to about 939.

==The Vikings==
===Refuge in Britain===
Alan had to take refuge, along with his father Mathuedoi I, with King Æthelstan of England because the Norsemen had invaded Armorica. The &quot;Chronicle of Nantes&quot; reports:

Alan became ruler of Brittany at the end of a 33-year interregnum after the death of his maternal grandfather, Duke Alan the Great.

===Return to Brittany===
Alan landed at Dol in 936, at the invitation of a monk, Jean de Landévennec, and with the aid of Æthelstan. By 937 Alan was master of most of Brittany, having forced the Norsemen back to the Loire.

In 938, Alan was elected &quot;Brittonum dux&quot;. On 1 August 939, with the aid of Judicael (Berengar), count of Rennes, and Hugh I, Count of Maine, his victory was made complete by defeating the Norse at the Battle of Trans-la-Forêt. Alan declared that date a national holiday.

==Louis IV of France and other alliances==
Alan II was closely allied with King Louis IV of West Francia, as both were exiles in England together at the court of Edward the Elder and Edward&#x27;s son and successor Æthelstan. Alan renounced the Cotentin, Avranchin and Mayenne and paid homage to Louis IV in 942. He was also allied to Theobald the Old, the count of Chartres.

==Family==
Alan II was the grandson of Alan I, King of Brittany and the great-grandson of Ridoreth, Count of Vannes. He was the grand-nephew of Pascweten.

His wife was a sister or a daughter of Count Theobald I of Blois. Their son, and Alan&#x27;s immediate successor, was Drogo, Duke of Brittany.

He also had at least two illegitimate sons, Hoël and Guerech, who would each succeed Drogo during the fractured rule of Brittany after Drogo&#x27;s death.

==Death==
Alan was buried in his capital, Nantes, in the church which he constructed to honor the Virgin Mary for his victory in liberating Nantes, initially known as la Chapelle de la Très Sainte Mère de Dieu, now known as the Basilique Notre Dame in the parish of St Thérèse in Nantes. He was succeeded by his son Drogo.

<doc id="633132" wikidata="Q465187" url="?curid=633132" title="Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Geoffrey I (c. 980 – 20 November 1008), also known as Geoffrey of Rennes and Geoffrey Berengar, was Duke of Brittany from 992 until his death, and also Count of Rennes (ruler of the Romano-Frankish &quot;civitas&quot; of Rennes) by right of succession. The eldest son of Duke Conan I of Brittany, he assumed the title of Duke of Brittany upon his father&#x27;s death in 992. Brittany had long been an independent state, but he had little control over much of Lower Brittany. 

==Life==
Geoffrey was the son of Duke Conan I, by his marriage to Ermengarde-Gerberga of Anjou. He was the grandson of Judicael Berengar, Count of Rennes.

When Geoffrey succeeded to Brittany he had several problems: 

*Blois was encroaching on his territory, 

*Vikings were threatening his shores, and

*He had to decide whether to accept the protection offered by Anjou.

===Norman alliance===
In 996, at about the age of sixteen, Geoffrey entered into a dynastic alliance with Richard II, Duke of Normandy, with a diplomatic double marriage between the two houses. The church-sanctioned marriage ceremonies were held at Mont Saint-Michel, on the Breton-Norman border, and while Geoffrey married Hawise of Normandy, daughter of Richard I of Normandy and sister of Richard II. Richard married Judith of Brittany, Geoffrey&#x27;s sister.

Geoffrey and Hawise had four children:

* Alan III of Brittany (997-1040)
* Evenus (born c. 998, died after 1037)
* Odo, Count of Penthièvre (died 1079)
* Adela, Abbess of Saint-Georges

===Death===
Geoffrey died on 20 November 1008 while travelling on a pilgrimage to Rome.

<text>Odo of Rennes (Medieval Breton: &quot;Eudon Pentevr&quot;, Modern Breton: &quot;Eozen Penteur&quot;, Latin: &quot;Eudo&quot;, French: &quot;Eudes/Éon de Penthièvre&quot;) (c. 999–1079), Count of Penthièvre, was the youngest of the three sons of Duke Geoffrey I of Brittany and Hawise of Normandy, daughter of Richard I of Normandy. Eudon married Agnes of Cornouaille (Orguen Kernev), the daughter of Alan Canhiart, Count of Cornouaille and sister of Hoel II, Duke of Brittany who was married in 1066 to Eudon&#x27;s niece Hawise, Duchess of Brittany.

==Role in Governance of Brittany==
When Eudon&#x27;s father Duke Geoffrey I died on 20 November 1008, both Eudon and his older brother Alan were minors.

Duke Geoffrey had initiated a dynastic double marriage with Richard II, Duke of Normandy by marrying Hawise of Normandy, one of Richard&#x27;s sisters, in 996; this was followed by the marriage of Geoffrey&#x27;s sister Judith of Brittany to Richard around the year 1000. Alan and Eudon were thus double-first cousins of Duke Richard II&#x27;s children, including Richard III, Duke of Normandy and Robert I, Duke of Normandy (William the Conqueror&#x27;s father), nephews of Emma of Normandy, and first cousins of Emma&#x27;s children Edward the Confessor, Harthacnut, Goda of England, Gunhilda of Denmark and Alfred Aetheling.

At Geoffrey&#x27;s death, Alan became &quot;de jure&quot; Duke, as Alan III, Duke of Brittany, Hawise took on the role of Regent, and Richard asserted the role of Guardian of Brittany, an arrangement reciprocated on the death of Robert I, Duke of Normandy in 1035.

Also in 1035, after a dispute between Eudon and Duke Alan III, their uncle Judicaël Bishop of Vannes arbitrated, and Alan III gave Eudon the bishoprics of Saint-Brieuc, Saint-Malo, Tréguier and Dol-de-Bretagne, as well as the counties and baronies of Penthièvre, Goëlo, Avaugour and Lamballe. Eudon placed his capital at Lamballe, where he began issuing coins in his own name.

Following the death of his brother Duke Alan III in 1040, Eudon ruled as regent of Brittany in the name of his nephew Conan II, holding Conan in custody. Conan was freed by his supporters in 1047. Eudon&#x27;s regency should have ended when Conan reached his majority (circa 1054), but Eudon refused to relinquish control of the Duchy.

In 1054 Geoffrey, Viscount of Mayenne in Maine, affronted by William of Normandy&#x27;s new fortifications at Ambrières, &quot;appealed to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou&quot; who &quot;called to his assistance Guy-William of Aquitaine and Count Eudo of Brittany&quot;

In a charter dated to 1056/1060, Eudon (&quot;Eudo&quot;) granted land &quot;in pago Belvacensi&quot; (Beauvais, Picardy) to the Abbey of Angers Saint-Aubin (q.v. Albinus of Angers). Witnesses included his wife Orguen and their sons Gausfridus, Alanus Rufus, Willelmus, Rotbertus and Ricardus (Geoffrey, Alan Rufus, William, Robert and Richard).

By 1056 Conan gained the upper hand in Brittany, and in 1057 he captured his uncle Eudon and chained him in a prison cell. Eudon&#x27;s eldest son Geoffrey Boterel continued to fight against Conan.

In 1062, peace was concluded between Conan and Geoffrey. Eudon, who was now free, continued the fight alone.

In histories favourable to the house of Penthièvre, Eudon is shown as effectively ruling Brittany between 1040 and 1062. In other histories his rule is shown as ending with his capture in 1057.

Conan was a legitimate contender for the title of Duke of Normandy, so he became a serious rival to Duke William.

In 1064, Eudon&#x27;s liegeman Rivallon I of Dol invited Duke William to join him against Conan, thus initiating the Breton-Norman War of 1064–1065 in which Normandy, Anjou, Dol de Bretagne and the captive Harold Godwinson combined against Conan II, as depicted in three panels of the Bayeux Tapestry. Historians differ on whether William or Conan should be considered the victor in this conflict.

==Involvement in the Preparations for the Norman Conquest of England==
Eudon provided, trained and equipped 5,000 Breton soldiers for William the Conqueror&#x27;s army. Of these, 4,000 were professionals, comprising light cavalry, heavy cavalry, archers, crossbowmen and axemen; he also trained 1,000 levied (conscripted) spearmen. Eudon put these troops on 100 ships under the command of his sons Count Alan Rufus and Count Brian, and they sailed from Brittany to join the Norman forces gathering at Barfleur then on to William&#x27;s staging point at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, in readiness to cross the Channel.

==Rebellion against Hoel II of Brittany==
Despite his advanced years, Eudon was involved in the failed 1075/1076 rebellion against Hoel II, Duke of Brittany, by Geoffrey Grenonat of Rennes and Ralph de Gael (fresh from his 1075 rebellion against King William). Hoel II was supported by William the Conqueror, briefly placing Eudon and William on opposing sides once again, a situation that was soon resolved when, to William&#x27;s disappointment, Hoel came to terms with the rebels.

==Death==
On 7 January 1079, at about 80 years of age, Eudon died in Cesson-Sévigné, an eastern suburb of Rennes. He was buried in Saint-Brieuc Cathedral.

In his memory, &quot;Comes Alanus Rufus&quot; (Count Alan Rufus), his second son, donated property to Swavesey Abbey in Cambridgeshire, for the soul of &quot;patris sui Eudonis comitis&quot; (his father Count Eudon), by an undated charter witnessed by &quot;...Ribaldus et Bardulfus fratres comitis...&quot; (Ribald and Bardulf, brothers of Count Alan).

==Family==
Orderic Vitalis stated:

&quot;God also gave him [Count Eudon] seven sons, who became remarkable for the singular and changeable events of their lives. The studious might compose a long and pleasing history, from true accounts of their various fortunes.&quot;

Eudon&#x27;s children with Agnes include:

*Adèle (born c. 1035, died after 1056/57).
*Geoffrey Boterel I, Count of Penthièvre (d. 24 August 1093)
*Brian, Earl of Cornwall (d. after 1084).
*Alan Rufus (Latin; alternatively Alain Le Roux in French, or Alan Ar Rouz in Breton, called Count Alan in the Domesday Book, his name means &quot;Red Deer&quot; or &quot;Hart&quot;) (d. 1093–98). He promoted trade at Boston, Lincolnshire, built St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York, Richmond Castle and the first castle at Middleham, and was effectively the first Earl of Richmond, though the majority of his manors were in East Anglia. Richmondshire in North Yorkshire is described in the Domesday Book as &quot;Terra Alani Comitis&quot; (&quot;The Land of Count Alan&quot;) in &quot;Eborakscire&quot; (Yorkshire). In the Rebellion of 1088, he was the first of the great magnates to support William II of England against Odo, Earl of Kent and his allies.
* Alan the Black (alternatively Alain Niger, or Alan Ar Du in Breton, his name means &quot;Black Deer&quot;) (d. 1094–98), inherited from Alan Rufus.
* Stephen, Count of Tréguier, married Havise of Guingamp, and succeeded Alan Rufus and Alan the Black as de facto Earl of Richmond. Stephen and Havise had a number of legitimate children and grandchildren, all of whom are ancestors of the current British royal family.
* Robert, a priest in Yorkshire (d. after 1083).
* Richard, a canon of Bayeux at the time when Thomas of Bayeux, Thomas&#x27;s brother Samson and William de Saint-Calais were also canons there.
* Guillaume or William, who came to Switzerland, entering the service of the Holy Roman Emperor; he was the suppressor of the revolt of Agaunum (today Saint-Maurice-en-Valais), and received a castle in his honour.
* An unnamed daughter, who married Enisandus Musardus de Pleveno who was the Lord of Cheveley in Cambridgeshire (under Alan Rufus as tenant-in-chief), first Constable of Richmond Castle and lord of some twenty manors in Richmondshire. Cheveley was recorded until 1457 as remaining under the overlordship of the Honour of Richmond.

Sons of Eudon who were probably illegitimate include:

* Ribald, who received the Lordship of Middleham from Alan Rufus, was a male-line ancestor of the Ancient House of Neville.
* Bardolf lord of Ravensworth, who moved to England where he held the lordship of Ravensworth and became the ancestor of the Fitzhugh family.
* Bodin, Lord of Bedale and Didderston and brother of Bardolf.
* (Possibly) Derrien, Lord of La Roche-Derrien in Brittany.

At least two of Eudon&#x27;s sons (Alan Rufus and Brian) were early participants in the Norman conquest of England.

Eudon&#x27;s descendants formed the junior branch of the Breton ducal family, which gained control of the duchy in 1156 under his great-grandson Conan IV of Brittany.

<text>Alan III of Rennes (c. 997 – 1 October 1040) (French: Alain III de Bretagne) was Count of Rennes and duke of Brittany, by right of succession from 1008 to his death.

==Life==
Alan was the son of Duke Geoffrey I and Hawise of Normandy. 

Alan succeeded his father as Duke of Brittany in 1008. Because he was still a minor at his father&#x27;s death, his mother acted as regent of Brittany while her brother Richard II, Duke of Normandy assumed guardianship over Brittany. 

===Marriage===
In 1018 Alan married Bertha of Blois, daughter of Odo II, Count of Blois and his second wife Ermengarde of Auvergne.

===Norman suzerainty===
When Richard III, Duke of Normandy died in August 1026, his brother Robert I succeeded him. Alan apparently took advantage of the resulting turmoil to break free of Norman suzerainty. 

In the early 1030s Robert I successfully attacked Dol and Alan&#x27;s retaliatory raid on Avranches was repulsed causing continued raiding back and forth between them. Facing an invasion from Normandy via land and from Duke Robert&#x27;s fleet, Robert, Archbishop of Rouen (uncle of Hawise and Richard II) mediated a truce between his two great-nephews at Mont Saint-Michel where Alan swore fealty to his cousin Robert. 

===Guardian===
When he left Normandy for the Holy Land Robert I, Duke of Normandy appointed his cousin, Alan III, to be a guardian of his young son William. 

===Wars===
Alan III also assisted Herbert I &#x27;Wake-Dog&#x27; in his wars with 
Avesgaud, Bishop of Le Mans and was with the count in his attack on Avesgaud&#x27;s castle at La Ferté-Bernard destroying the castle and causing Avesgaud to flee.

===Protector===
In 1037, upon the death of Robert, Archbishop of Rouen, the protection of young William was now left to Alan III and his cousin Gilbert, who tentatively held Normandy together. They appointed Mauger to the now vacant see of Rouen and his brother William as count of Arques, attempting to gain their support for Duke William.

===Death===
On 1 October 1040, while besieging a rebel castle near Vimoutiers in Normandy, Alan III suddenly died. According to Orderic, he was poisoned by unnamed Normans.

==Family==
Alain and Bertha of Blois had:

* Conan II, (d. 1066), succeeded his father. 
* Hawise of Brittany, who married Hoel of Cornouaille.

After 14 May 1046 his widow Bertha married secondly Hugh IV, Count of Maine.

<text>The Grand Order of the Aleph Zadik Aleph (AZA or ) is an international youth-led fraternal organization for Jewish teenagers. It was founded in 1924 as the male wing of BBYO Inc., an independent non-profit organization. It is for teens starting in 8th grade, through 12th grade.

==History==

===Founding===
AZA was founded on May 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, by a group of 14 Jewish teenagers between the ages of 15 and 17. It arose as a response to the fact that the Jewish community was, for the most part, not allowed into the Greek fraternities. The letters were chosen to spite the fraternity the Alephs were denied, Alpha Zeta Alpha, by naming their fraternity the Hebrew counterparts. However, others maintain that AZA was not founded as a form of protest against Greek fraternities. Rather, conversations with the founding members years later revealed that the organization&#x27;s name was chosen specifically in an attempt to mimic Greek fraternities.

The first chapter, formed in 1923, was Mother Chapter AZA #1, which continues to operate. The second oldest chapter also continues to operate out of Kansas City Council and is AZA #2. 

Abe Babior, the new group&#x27;s first president, said that it was started &quot;as a social and Zionist youth group.&quot; The group&#x27;s meetings would usually feature speakers on several both Judaic and non-Judaic topics. The group held social events, including parties and dances. The group&#x27;s first advisor was Nathan Mnookin. An accomplished chemist, he moved back to his hometown of Kansas City in November 1923 and immediately started a similar organization of the same name. Mnookin&#x27;s departure paved the way for the next AZA advisor in Omaha, Sam Beber.

===National organization===
As Beber continued to serve as an advisor for the local Omaha group, he also began planning for a much larger undertaking: an international Jewish youth group. Beber called a meeting of friends and associates in the area on May 3, 1924, where they reached an understanding of goals and formed the first Supreme Advisory Committee (SAC) consisting of seven men, and officially founding the Aleph Zadik Aleph for Young Men. The new organization&#x27;s first chapter charter was granted to the existing AZA group in Omaha, dubbed &quot;Mother Chapter&quot; with Mnookin&#x27;s second chapter in Kansas City receiving a charter a week later. By the end of the month, new chapters had been launched in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Des Moines, Iowa.

The first AZA convention was held that summer at the Jewish Community Center in Omaha, July 4–6, 1924. Over two-thirds of the new organization&#x27;s membership was present to elect their first-ever Grand Aleph Godol (international president). In a tight race that required a referral to the SAC to break a tie vote, Charles Shane emerged victorious. In other business conducted, the boys chose to commit a third of their membership dues (at that time $3) to charity. AZA became an official junior group in 1925.

By the second annual convention, held in Kansas City, AZA in July 1925, membership had ballooned to 250, and new chapters were inaugurated in eight more cities. Philip Klutznick, among AZA&#x27;s most accomplished alumni, was elected as the 2nd Grand Aleph Godol. During his term, he installed ten chapters in the eastern part of the country and oversaw the creation of The Shofar, the organization&#x27;s international newsletter. Following his term in office, the organization rewarded him by making him, at the age of 19, their first executive director. By the third annual convention in July 1925, the group had 800 members and twenty chapters.

In 1940, AZA had 21,152 members, 417 chapters, and 9,875. Chapters were located in Bulgaria, Palestine, Syria, and the United States. In 1974, AZA was at its height with 40,000 members. Membership had declined to 15,000 in 2005.

==Symbols and traditions==

The letters Aleph Zadik Aleph and stands for Ahava (fraternal love), Tzedakah (benevolence), and Ahdoot (harmony). The letters were also the same as those of Alpha Zeta Alpha, a local fraternity in Omahah that banned Jewish members at the time. Its motto is &quot;More Jewish Teens, More Meaningful Jewish Experiences&quot; The fraternity&#x27;s color is blue, symbolizing loyalty, trust, and wisdom.

The AZA logo is a &quot;menorah&quot;, a seven-branched candelabrum, which is one of the central symbols of Judaism. The &quot;menorah&quot; has a hexagonal shape in its center, with each side of the hexagon and the base of the &quot;menorah&quot; containing one of the 7 Cardinal Principles. In the center of the hexagon is a &quot;Magen david&quot; (Star of David), and inside it are the Hebrew letters Aleph Zadik Aleph. 

The password &quot;Ami&quot; (My People) to enter an AZA meeting is now widely known and is used for ceremonial and traditional purposes only.

When members (&quot;Alephs&quot;) are inducted into the organization, they receive a pin containing the AZA logo. This pin is to be worn at all AZA functions (including meetings, programs, and conventions) as a way of visually displaying one&#x27;s membership in the organization. It is supposed to be worn on one&#x27;s shirt, over the heart, to symbolize that the principles (which are inscribed on the AZA logo on the pin) are being kept close to one&#x27;s heart. Aleph Pins are never to be worn straight, to represent that &quot;no Aleph is perfect.&quot;

Many of the AZA spirit songs date back to the earliest days of the organization. The most commonly sung song is &quot;Up You Men&quot;, the official pep song of the organization which dates to 1931, when it was the winning entry in a song contest. It was composed by Heinie Krinsky and Wes Bercovich from Oakland, and in modern times is sung both at a fast pace as a rally song, and sometimes in a slow and somber tone as a brotherhood song. &quot;Come Join Us In Our Song&quot; is a popular song to be sung at conventions and summer programs. It is the longest of the AZA songs. It was originally called &quot;Meyer Levin&#x27;s Marching Song&quot; and was written for AZA Invite by the members of Meyer Levin AZA in Chicago in 1964. The verses are sung to the tune of &quot;The Ballad of the Greenland Whalers&quot;, and the chorus is sung to the tune of &quot;The Coast Guard Hymn&quot;. &quot;Sweetheart of AZA&quot;, also composed by Krinsky and Bercovich, is traditionally recited when the sweetheart (a well-liked BBG member chosen to serve in the role at various levels) enters the room, although its use in modern times varies from region to region. Lastly, Simon Wiesenthal AZA #2524 in Central Region West is noted for writing the widely sung cheer &quot;AZA All the Way.&quot; Other official songs include &quot;Stand Together,&quot; &quot;Tomorrow and Today,&quot; &quot;This Is Our Order&quot;, &quot;No Man Is An Island&quot;, and &quot;The General&quot;.

There are Seven Cardinal Principles through which all AZA members (Alephs) are expected to conduct their lives. These principles underline the intent and character of the organization. They are patriotism, Judaism, filial love, charity, conduct, purity, and fraternity. These principles are inscribed on the AZA logo. They are often recited during opening rituals of business meetings.
==Activities==
Six programming &quot;folds&quot;, or considerations, are used as the basis for all program planning. In 1928, Dr. Boris D. Bogen, one of the founders of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, presented his ideas for the original &quot;Five-Fold-and-Full Plan&quot; to AZA&#x27;s governing body, the Supreme Advisory Council. He proposed the addition of the original five programming folds: Social, Athletics, Community Service / Social Action, Education, and Judaism (S.A.C.E.J.) In 2020, the 97th Executive Body voted to add a sixth programming fold, &#x27;health&#x27;. It is expected that all AZA events fall into at least one of these folds, and it is encouraged that programs span multiple folds. A program that incorporates every fold, a &quot;six-fold program&quot;, is considered a significant undertaking and is particularly special.

==Governance==

===Levels===
AZA is administered internationally by BBYO, Inc.&#x27;s professional staff in the international office in Washington, D.C. Organizational units outside of North America are affiliated with BBYO, Inc. but are operated independently. In North America, the organization is broken down into 43 geographic regions, each of which has a professional staff that reports to the international office. Some regions may be further split into councils and cities depending on their size and geography, and each of these may also employ staff. The final level is the chapter, which employs volunteer advisors, and reports to their local staff. All members belong to a single chapter. Some BBYO programs (such as summer programs in Israel) do not require membership in BBYO.

===Leadership===
The organization is steered by a democratically elected board of officers on the international, regional, council, and chapter levels. The officers elected may vary from one level to the other and between different chapters and regions. A group of elected officers is often referred to as the &quot;executive board&quot; or just simply the &quot;board&quot;. Elections are typically held annually or semi-annually.

The executive board positions that are elected at an international level (and the foundation for all other boards at all levels) are &quot;Aleph Godol&quot; (president), &quot;Aleph S&#x27;gan&quot; (programming vice president), &quot;Aleph Moreh&quot; (membership vice president), &quot;Aleph Shaliach&quot; (Judaic vice president), &quot;Aleph Mazkir&quot; (secretary), &quot;Aleph Gizbor&quot; (treasurer), and &quot;Aleph Sopher&quot; (publicist).

In some places, additional officers may be elected based on need. Each region, council, and chapter may have its constitution detailing the positions to be elected and their specific responsibilities, so long as it does not conflict with the international constitution. Additionally, each chapter may have a different variation of the positions. For example, Ruach AZA #2388 has the Mazkir and Gizbor merged into one position: The MazGiz.

== Affiliation ==
AZA&#x27;s sister organization, for teenage girls, is the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Girls. The connection between AZA and B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith dates back to AZA&#x27;s earliest days when Sam Beber was simultaneously serving as the AZA advisor and as the vice president of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith lodge in Omaha. Soon thereafter, the new organization was able to secure funding from the regional B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith lodge. At the first AZA international convention in 1924, it was resolved that the organization should seek affiliation with B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. Beber commenced communication, and at the executive committee meeting in January 1925, President Adolf Kraus appointed a committee to explore the matter, headed by Henry Monsky. A fellow Omaha resident, Monsky brought the issue of adopting &quot;junior auxiliaries&quot; to the forefront of the organization. Following B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&#x27;s international convention, in which Monsky&#x27;s committee recommended the adoption of AZA as the official youth organization of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, the executive committee met and immediately adopted the recommendation. 

B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith lodges often adopted AZA chapters, collaborated on joint programming, and served in an advisory capacity. AZA was eventually combined with the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Girls (BBG) into what would become known as the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization (BBYO). As the male wing of BBYO, AZA continued to maintain its unique character, traditions, and rituals, even though it was administered jointly with BBG under the BBYO umbrella. BBYO split from B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith in 2002 and was re-formed as an independent non-profit organization.

<doc id="633144" wikidata="Q732702" url="?curid=633144" title="Barremian">
<text>The Barremian is an age in the geologic timescale (or a chronostratigraphic stage) between 125.77 Ma (million years ago) and 121.4 ± 1.0 Ma (Historically, this stage was placed at 129.4 million to approximately 125 million years ago) It is a subdivision of the Early Cretaceous Epoch (or Lower Cretaceous Series). It is preceded by the Hauterivian and followed by the Aptian Stage.

==Stratigraphic definitions==
The original type locality for the Barremian Stage is in the vicinity of the village of Barrême, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France. Henri Coquand defined the stage and named it in 1873. 

The base of the Barremian is determined by the first appearance of the ammonites &quot;Spitidiscus hugii&quot; and &quot;Spitidiscus vandeckii&quot;. The end of the Barremian is determined by the geomagnetic reversal at the start of the M0r chronozone, which is biologically near the first appearance of the ammonite &quot;Paradeshayesites oglanlensis&quot;.

===Regional equivalents===
The Barremian falls in the Gallic epoch, a subdivision of the Cretaceous that is no longer used by the ICS. It overlaps the lower part of the stage, which is sometimes used in western European stratigraphy. In North America, the late Coahulian and the early Comanchean correspond to the Barremian. In New Zealand, it falls within the Mokoiwian, and in Japan it corresponds to the late Aritan.

=== Subdivision ===
The Barremian is often subdivided into two substages or subages, Lower/Early and Upper/Late Barremian.

In the Tethys domain, the Barremian stage contains eleven ammonite biozones:
* zone of &quot;Pseudocrioceras waagenoides&quot;

<text>Conan II of Rennes (c. 1033 – 11 December 1066) was Duke of Brittany, from 1040 to his death. Conan was the eldest child and heir of Alan III, Duke of Brittany by his wife Bertha of Blois, and member of the House of Rennes. He was the elder brother of Hawise, who succeeded him as &quot;suo jure&quot; duchess.
== Duke of Brittany ==
Conan II faced a daunting series of challenges to assert his rule as Duke of Brittany. His father Duke Alan III had died when Conan was still a minor, his grandfather Duke Geoffrey I&#x27;s attempts at an alliance with Normandy had been reduced to border skirmishes, his uncle Odo challenged his right to rule and he faced a rebellion from Breton nobles, notably Rivallon I of Dol.
Conan&#x27;s inheritance was usurped by his uncle, Odo, who initially ruled Brittany as regent during Conan&#x27;s minority. However, by the time Conan reached his majority his uncle Odo refused to give up his authority. By 1057 Conan captured his uncle, whom he then had chained and imprisoned.

===Norman interference===
Once enthroned as Duke Conan II of Brittany, he faced numerous threats, including revolts from his nobles sponsored by William, Duke of Normandy, afterwards King of England.

Brittany, an independent Celtic duchy, had a traditional rivalry with neighboring Normandy. The 1064–1065 war between Brittany and Normandy was sparked after Duke William supported Rivallon I of Dol&#x27;s rebellion against Conan II. 

In 1065, before his invasion of Anglo-Saxon England, William of Normandy sent word to the surrounding counties, including Brittany, warning them against attacking his lands, on the grounds that his mission bore the papal banner. Conan promptly informed the duke that he would definitely take the opportunity to invade the latter&#x27;s duchy. In the history of conflicts between Brittany and Anjou, Pouancé had served as the &quot;Breton March&quot; or border town. During Conan&#x27;s 1066 campaign against Anjou, he took Pouancé and Segré, and arrived in Château-Gontier, where he was found dead after donning poisoned riding gloves. Duke William was widely suspected. He was also asked to help William the Conqueror on his 1066 conquest of England, but refused, saying that the Normans poisoned his father in 1040.

Conan II died leaving no known issue. It is possible he died because the gloves he was wearing were poisoned, and he swallowed the poison when he wiped his mouth with the glove.

===Succession===
He was succeeded by his sister Hawise and brother-in-law, Hoël II, whose marriage may have been a political move to consolidate and stabilize the east and west regions of the duchy following Conan&#x27;s death.

<text>Hoël II (c. 1031–1084) was Count of Kernev (&quot;French: Cornouaille&quot;, &quot;Breton: Kernev&quot;), from 1058 as Hoël V. On the basis of his marriage to Hawise, Duchess of Brittany, in 1066, he became Duke of Brittany &quot;jure uxoris&quot;.

==Life==
Hoël was the son of Count Alan Canhiart of Cornouaille and his wife, Judith of Nantes, granddaughter of the illegitimate son of Duke Alan II of Brittany. Hoël started the House of Cornouaille of Brittany, which ruled the duchy until 1156.

Hoël became count of Nantes in 1054. The title came to him from his maternal cousin, Count Matthew I of Nantes, who died in 1050. Alan Canhiart seize the county in Hoël&#x27;s name in 1050, and ruled it as regent for his son until 1054. Duke Conan II of Brittany attempted to seize Nantes in 1054 but was defeated. 

Conan died childless in December 1066 and the duchy passed to Hawise and Hoël, but their marriage may have further strengthened Brittany at a time when external interference was attempted by William the Conqueror. Hawise died in 1072.

During his reign Hoël faced several rebellions from Breton nobles. Geoffrey Grenonat of Rennes (an illegitimate son of Duke Alan III of Brittany and half-brother of Hawise) led a revolt and was joined by Ralph de Gael who had returned to Brittany from England after the failure of the previous year&#x27;s Revolt of the Earls. In 1076, Ralph having plotted against Hoël, was besieged at Dol. William the Conqueror came to Hoël&#x27;s aid, after which Hoël finally made peace with Ralph.

==Marriage and children==
Hoël and Hawise had: 
* Alan IV, succeeded to the duchy of Brittany
* Matthew, succeeded to the county of Nantes.

<text>Alan IV (c. 1063 – 13 October 1119) was Duke of Brittany from 1072 until his abdication in 1112. He was also Count of Nantes (from c. 1103) and Count of Rennes. His parents were Duchess Hawise and Duke Hoel II. He is also known as Alan Fergant. Through his father, he was of the Breton House of Cornouaille dynasty (Breton: &quot;Kerne&quot; dynasty). He was the last Breton-speaking Duke of Brittany. 

==Conflict with Normandy==

A traditional rivalry between Brittany and Normandy continued at the close of the 11th century. The Breton-Norman war of 1064–1065 was the result of William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy (later to become known as William the Conqueror) support of rebels in Brittany against Alan&#x27;s maternal uncle, Conan II.

Conan II died in late 1066 during a campaign in Anjou, and was succeeded by Alan&#x27;s parents, Hawise and Hoël II. When Hawise died in 1072, Alan became duke, but as he was a minor, Hoël ruled as regent until Alan reached his majority in 1084.

To prevent further hostilities during his invasion of England, William I married his daughter Constance to the new duke Alan in 1087. The marriage ceremonies may have taken place in Bayeux in Normandy. William of Malmesbury wrote that Constance was unpopular at the Breton court because of her &quot;severe and conservative&quot; manner. However, Orderic Vitalis wrote that as duchess Constance did all she could to further the welfare of the Bretons, who grieved deeply at her death in 1090.

In 1092, Alan IV donated property to the abbey of Redon by charter, and by 1093 married Ermengarde of Anjou, as a political alliance with Fulk IV of Anjou to counter Anglo-Norman influence. 
Duke Alan IV&#x27;s cousin Geoffrey I Boterel (eldest brother of Alan Rufus) died on 24 August 1093 in battle at Dol while in rebellion against the Duke.

Between 1101 and 1104, Alan&#x27;s younger brother, Count Matthew II of Nantes, died without issue and his county passed to Alan.

Alan IV abdicated as duke in 1112. The former duke retired to the monastery of Redon, where he died in 1119.

==Crusader==
In 1098 Alan went on the First Crusade, as part of the army of Robert Curthose, leaving Ermengarde as his regent, and returned in 1101.

==Family==

Alan IV married Constance of Normandy, the daughter of William I of England, in 1087. Constance died in 1090. William of Malmesbury alleges that her husband, Alan, had their servants poison her.
They had no children.

Alan&#x27;s second marriage was to Ermengarde of Anjou in 1093. With Ermengarde he had three children:
*Geoffrey - died young;
* Conan - his successor as Duke of Brittany
* Hawise - she married Count Baldwin VII of Flanders, also known as &quot;Hawise Fergant.&quot; They divorced and had no issue.

Alan and Ermengarde were separated upon his abdication as duke in 1112.

He had two illegitimate sons:
*Brian Fitzcount - held the lordships of Wallingford and Abergavenny. Was a favourite of Henry I of England, and a staunch supporter of his daughter, the Empress Matilda, during the Anarchy (1135–1153).
* Guihomar

==Succession==
Alan IV died in 1119 at the monastery of Redon, where he had retired after his abdication in 1112, and separation from his wife Ermengarde. His only surviving son, Conan III succeeded him.

<text>Conan III, also known as Conan of Cornouaille and Conan the Fat (, and ; c. 1093–1096 – 17 September 1148) was duke of Brittany, from 1112 to his death. He was the son of Alan IV, Duke of Brittany and Ermengarde of Anjou.

Conan III allied himself with Stephen of England in the Anarchy, Stephen&#x27;s war against the dispossessed Empress Matilda.

==Family==
He married Maud, an illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England before 1113. Conan and Maud had three children that are known:
*Hoel (1116 - 1156) – disinherited from the ducal crown; Count of Nantes;
*Bertha (1114 - after 1155) – married Alan of Penthièvre; upon Alan&#x27;s death in 1146, she returned to Brittany;
*Constance (1120 - 1148) – married Sir Geoffroy II, Sire de Mayenne, son of Juhel II, Seigneur de Mayenne.

==Succession==
On his death-bed in 1148, Conan III disinherited Hoel from succession to the duchy, stating that he was illegitimate and no son of his. By this surprise move Bertha became his heiress and successor. However, Hoel was to retain the County of Nantes.

<text>The Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM; ) is the official government supervisory organ for Protestantism in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is colloquially known as the Three-Self Church ().

The National Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China () and the China Christian Council (CCC) are known in China as the &quot;lianghui&quot; (two organizations). Together, they form the state-sanctioned Protestant church in mainland China. They are overseen by the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) following the State Administration for Religious Affairs&#x27; absorption into the UFWD in 2018.

== History ==

=== Christian Manifesto ===
&lt;section begin=&quot;christian-manifesto&quot; /&gt;In May 1950, Y. T. Wu and other prominent Protestant leaders such as T. C. Chao, Chen Chonggui, and Cora Deng met in Beijing with Chinese premier Zhou Enlai to discuss Protestant Christianity&#x27;s relationship with the young People&#x27;s Republic of China. &quot;The Christian Manifesto&quot; was published in July 1950 and its original title was &quot;Direction of Endeavor for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China&quot;. During the 1950s, 400,000 Protestant Christians publicly endorsed and signed this document.

The purpose of publishing this document was:
to heighten our vigilance against imperialism, to make known the clear political stand of Christians in New China, to hasten the building of a Chinese church whose affairs are managed by the Chinese themselves, and to indicate the responsibilities that should be taken up by Christians throughout the whole country in national reconstruction in New China.

It further stated the movement promoted the &quot;self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation&quot; () of the Chinese church.&lt;section end=&quot;christian-manifesto&quot; /&gt;

=== Three-Self Reform Movement ===
In March 1951, after China&#x27;s entry into the Korean War, the Religious Affairs Bureau directed religious groups to make elimination of imperialist influences a priority. In mid-April the State Administrative Council called together a conference in Beijing on the subject of &quot;Handling of Christian Organizations Receiving Subsidies from the United States of America&quot;. This conference led to the formation of the Preparatory Committee for the Oppose-America, Assist-Korea Three-Self Reform Movement of the Christian Church (TSRM) under China&#x27;s United Work Front policy. Those who attended the conference issued a &quot;United Declaration&quot; calling churches and other Christian organizations “to thoroughly, permanently and completely sever all relationships with the American missions and all other missions, thus realizing self-government, self-support and self-propagation in the Chinese church.&quot; The declaration had the unexpected effect of swelling the membership of congregations that identified themselves as “self-run.”

=== Establishment ===

When the TSPM was established in 1954, it promoted a three-self strategy in order to remove foreign influences from the Chinese churches and to assure the government that the churches would be patriotic to the newly established People&#x27;s Republic of China. Other Protestant leaders included Jia Yuming, Marcus Cheng, and Yang Shaotang.

When &quot;The Christian Manifesto&quot; was published in the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; in 1954, it pledged the support of Christians for anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism efforts. The movement, in the eyes of critics, allowed the government to infiltrate, subvert, and control much of organized Christianity.

The work towards establishing the Protestant TSPM was seen to have potential also for Chinese Catholics to create a &quot;three-self&quot; (or, in English sources, often translated &quot;three-autonomies&quot;) patriotic organization, even though this language was never used in earlier Catholic missiological discourse like it was by Protestant missionaries. Those who resisted were arrested or killed. But by 1957, some Chinese Catholics eventually established the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.

=== After the Cultural Revolution ===
From 1966 to 1976 during the Cultural Revolution, the expression of religious life in China was effectively banned, including the TSPM. The growth of the Chinese house church movement during this period was a result of all Chinese Christian worship being driven underground for fear of persecution. In 1979 the government officially restored the TSPM after thirteen years of non-existence, and in 1980 the China Christian Council (CCC) was formed. However, many Christians in China were skeptical of the government&#x27;s intention in reinstituting the TSPM, partly because those entrusted in its local administration were often ones who had participated in repressive actions in the past.

In 1980, the CCP Central Committee approved a request by the United Front Work Department to create a national conference for religious groups. The TSPM was one of five such religious groups, which also included the Islamic Association of China, the Chinese Taoist Association, the Catholic Patriotic Association, and the Buddhist Association of China.

The TSPM is not a denomination, and denominational distinctions do not exist within the organization. Pastors are trained at one of thirteen officially sanctioned seminaries. Current theological emphasis is on &quot;a protection and promotion of the five basic tenets of Christian faith—the Trinity, Christ being both human and God, the Virgin Birth, Death and Resurrection and the Second Coming.&quot; The primary role of the TSPM was then delegated to liaison with the Government whereas the CCC serves as an ecclesial organization focusing on the internal management and affairs of the Church.

Oversight of religion flows from recognition by the Chinese Communist Party of five religions: Buddhism, Catholicism, Taoism, Islam, and Protestantism, although the CCP&#x27;s nearly 100 million members are required to be atheist. Authorities tightly monitor registered and unregistered religious groups, and the TSPM is often charged with being an instrument for the secular Chinese government, which persecutes Christians outside of it. Independent congregations are known as house churches. The attempt to bring house church Christians into the fold of &quot;registered&quot; meeting places has met with mixed results. Since the ascension of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has cracked down on house churches and oppressed their members, actions which the TSPM has supported.

In 2018, the TSPM&#x27;s parent organization, the State Administration for Religious Affairs, was absorbed into the CCP&#x27;s United Front Work Department.

In March 2019, Xu Xiaohong, the chairman of the National Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, gave a speech about the use of Christianity by western powers to destabilize China and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In addition he stated in a speech at the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference that &quot;Anti-China forces in the West are attempting to continue to influence the social stability of our country through Christianity, and even subvert the political power of our country&quot;. He also called for continued state action against independent Christians stating &quot;For individual black sheep who, under the banner of Christianity, participate in subverting national security, we firmly support the country to bring them to justice&quot;.

==Publications==
The &quot;Chinese New Hymnal&quot;, first published in the 1980s, is the official hymnal of the TSPM churches. Editors include Lin Shengben, a renowned hymn composer in Shanghai.

The &quot;Canaan Hymns&quot; hymnal associated with the house churches is also used in TSPM churches. Through its official channels, TSPM has criticized the hymn for supposedly questioning the Movement&#x27;s view of Christianity in service of Chinese socialism. TSPM church services also feature non-Christian Communist Party songs.

The main periodical of TSPM is &quot;Tian Feng&quot;.

== Statement of faith ==
The following confession of faith was adopted by the TSPM on 8 January 2008:

<doc id="633155" wikidata="Q1044413" url="?curid=633155" title="Peplos">
<text>A peplos () is a body-length garment established as typical attire for women in ancient Greece by , during the late Archaic and Classical period. It was a long, rectangular cloth with the top edge folded down about halfway, so that what was the top of the rectangle was now draped below the waist, and the bottom of the rectangle was at the ankle. One side of the peplos could be left open, or pinned or sewn together, with a type of brooch later called &quot;fibula&quot;. In Latin and in a Roman context, it could be called a &quot;palla&quot;. 

It should not be confused with the Ionic chiton, which was a piece of fabric folded over and sewn together along the longer side to form a tube. The Classical garment is represented in Greek vase painting from the 5th century BC and in the metopes of temples in the Doric order.

Spartan women continued to wear the peplos much later in history than other Greek cultures. It was also shorter and with slits on the side causing other Greeks to call them phainomērídes (φαινομηρίδες), the &quot;thigh-showers&quot;.

==Rituals==

On the last day of the month Pyanepsion, the priestess of Athena Polias and the Arrephoroi, a group of girls chosen to help in the making of the sacred peplos, set up the loom on which the enormous peplos was to be woven by the Ergastinai, another group of girls chosen to spend about nine months making the sacred peplos. They had to weave a theme of Athena&#x27;s defeat of Enkelados and the Olympian&#x27;s defeat of the Giants. The peplos of the statue was changed each year during the Plynteria.

The peplos played a role in the Athenian festival of the Great Panathenaea. Nine months before the festival, at the arts and crafts festival titled &quot;Chalkeia&quot;, a special peplos would begin to be woven by young women. During the Panathenaea, the peplos was taken up to the Acropolis of Athens to be presented to the wooden statue of Athena Polias in the Erechtheion, opposite the Parthenon. The main scene of the Parthenon frieze is believed, although not without disagreement, to represent this peplos scene during the Panathenaea. The peplos had images of the mythic battle between gods and giants woven into its material and usually consisted of purple and saffron yellow cloth.

<text>Every Picture Tells a Story is the third studio album by British singer-songwriter Rod Stewart, released on 28 May 1971, by Mercury Records. It incorporates hard rock, folk, and blues styles. It went to number one on both the UK and US charts and finished third in the Jazz &amp; Pop critics&#x27; poll for best album of 1971. It has been an enduring critical success, including a number 172 ranking on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

==History==
This album is a mixture of rock, country, blues, soul, and folk, and includes Stewart&#x27;s breakthrough hit, &quot;Maggie May&quot;, as well as &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, a song from Tim Hardin&#x27;s debut album of 1966. &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, with Pete Sears on piano, was released as the first single from the album with &quot;Maggie May&quot; as the B-side; however, &quot;Maggie May&quot; became more popular and was a No. 1 hit in both the UK and US.

The album includes a version of Arthur Crudup&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s All Right (Mama)&quot; (the first single for Elvis Presley) and a cover of the Bob Dylan song &quot;Tomorrow Is a Long Time&quot;, which was first released on 1971&#x27;s &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits Vol. II&quot;).

All five members of the Faces (with whom Stewart at that time was lead vocalist) appear on the album, with guitarist/bassist Ronnie Wood and keyboardist Ian McLagan on Hammond B3 organ being employed most. Due to contractual restrictions, the personnel listings were somewhat vague, and it was unclear that the full Faces line-up recorded the version of the Motown hit &quot;(I Know) I&#x27;m Losing You&quot;. Other contributors included Ray Jackson on mandolin (though Stewart allegedly forgot his name and merely mentioned &quot;the mandolin player in Lindisfarne&quot; on the sleeve) and Micky Waller on drums. Maggie Bell performed backing vocals (mentioned on the sleeve as &quot;vocal abrasives&quot;) on the title track, and Madeline Bell sang backup on the next track, &quot;Seems Like A Long Time&quot;. Pete Sears played all the piano on the album except for one track, &quot;I&#x27;m Losing You&quot;, which had Ian McLagan on piano, along with the Faces as a band.

The album reached the number-one position in both the UK (for six weeks) and the US (four weeks) at the same time that &quot;Maggie May&quot; was topping the singles charts in both territories.

The Temptations cover, &quot;I Know I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; reached the top 40 at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.

== Reception ==
In his original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, John Mendelsohn wrote: &quot;Boring as half of it may be, there&#x27;s enough that is unqualifiedly magnificent on the other half.&quot; However, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau gave the album a glowing review, writing: &quot;Rod the Wordslinger is a lot more literate than the typical English bloozeman, Rod the Singer can make words flesh, and though Rod the Bandleader&#x27;s music is literally electric it&#x27;s the mandolin and pedal steel that come through sharpest.&quot;

A retrospective review by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Tal Rosenberg called it &quot;a rollicking and surprisingly grounded document of early &#x27;70s folk-rock&quot;.

==Legacy==
The album has been an enduring critical success, including a number 172 ranking on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, dropping slightly in a 2020 revised list to number 177. In 1992, the album was awarded the number-one spot in Jimmy Guterman&#x27;s book &quot;The Best Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Records of All Time: A Fan&#x27;s Guide to the Stuff You Love&quot;. It was ranked 99th in a 2005 survey held by British television&#x27;s Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;Without greatly altering his approach, Rod Stewart perfected his blend of hard rock, folk, and blues on his masterpiece, &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot;.&quot;

==Track listing==

*&quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is not listed on the label on most editions, and on some CDs is part of &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;. The words were written by John Newton.

<text>Sleen is a village in Drenthe, Netherlands of about 2,500 people. Sleen has been inhabited for centuries. Much ancient history can be found in the area, particularly in the forests (which are planted, though). At birth and during the Republiek der Zeven Verenigde Nederlanden (Republic of the Seven United Netherlands (1581–1795)). Sleen became the capital of one of the six “dingspels” (administrative areas) of Drenthe. When Drenthe was recognised as a province, Sleen became a municipality capital, before it merged into the municipality of Coevorden.

Sleen has a 450-year-old church. At about 68 meters, it is the highest church in the entire province. Nowadays, it functions as a Dutch Reformed Church. There is also another Protestant church in the village.

Sleen has its own supermarket (behind the former police station), library, fish stand (every Wednesday), cafés, a few other shops, hair salons, petrol station, sports park (soccer, tennis, multipurpose indoor complex), horse riding school, houses for the elderly, and other facilities.
There are also two schools: CBS “de Fontein” (Christian primary school) and OBS “de Akker” (public primary school).

“De Brink” is the “centre” and the old part of the village, with some historic houses and a brick road. This is also where the two churches are, and other facilities like the former municipal centre. New houses were constructed over time, and an area known as “de nieuwbouw” is where the most recently constructed houses can be found.

The famous Pieterpad (a 498 kilometres (309 mi) long hiking route that runs from Pieterburen in the north of the country to the St Pietersberg in Maastricht in the south) goes straight through Sleen. The windmill &quot;De Hoop&quot; has been restored to working order.

<doc id="633160" wikidata="Q858505" url="?curid=633160" title="China Christian Council">
<text>The China Christian Council (CCC; ) was founded in 1980 as an umbrella organization for all Protestant churches in the People&#x27;s Republic of China with Bishop K. H. Ting as its president. It works to provide theological education and the publication of Bibles (mostly in the Chinese Union Version), hymnals (the Chinese New Hymnal mostly), and other religious literature. It encourages the exchange of information among local churches in evangelism, pastoral work and administration. It has formulated a church order for local churches, and seeks to continue to develop friendly relations with churches overseas.

== History ==
In the spring of 1979, Chinese churches resumed worship after the Cultural Revolution. In order to revive the church, the China Christian Council was founded at the third national Christian conference in 1980, to unite and provide services for churches in China, formulating Church Order and encouraging theological education. Daniel Bays suggests that there is &quot;a real desire for pastoral and congregational nurturing and spiritual development in the CCC, and perhaps a desire to separate from the direct political role of the TSPM.&quot;

Together with the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, the organizations are known as the &quot;lianghui&quot; (), or &quot;two organizations.&quot; Through the CCC, the registered Protestant church participates in the World Council of Churches. The CCC serves to unite and provide services for churches in China by formulating Church Order, encouraging theological education through seminaries and Bible schools, such as Nanjing Union Theological Seminary, publishing Bibles and other Christian materials, and coordinating training programs for churches.

In the recent 30 years, Christianity in China has developed rapidly. It introduces the best developing period in Chinese Christian history. Incomplete statistics indicate that there may be over 23 million Christians throughout the country, 30 times more than in 1949. There may also be over 56,000 churches and meeting points, 70 percent of which are newly built. More than 55 million copies of the Bible have been printed, 3,500,000 copies per year in recent years. There are a total of 21 theological seminaries with more than 1900 students in China.

The CCC/TSPM headquarters are No. 219, Jiujiang Road, Huangpu District, Shanghai (Postcode: 200002). The organizations jointly publish the &quot;Tian Feng&quot; magazine.

The current leadership were elected at the tenth National Christian Conference held in November 2018.

<doc id="633162" wikidata="Q751924" url="?curid=633162" title="73rd Academy Awards">
<text>The 73rd Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored the best of 2000 in film and took place on March 25, 2001, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, beginning at 5:30 p.m. PST / 8:30 p.m. EST. During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and was directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Steve Martin hosted the show for the first time. Three weeks earlier in a ceremony at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California held on March 3, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Renée Zellweger.

&quot;Gladiator&quot; won five awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;Traffic&quot; with four awards and &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, &quot;Big Mama&quot;, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, &quot;Father and Daughter&quot;, &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, &quot;Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport&quot;, &quot;Pollock&quot;, &quot;Quiero Ser&quot;, &quot;U-571&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; with one. The telecast garnered almost 43 million viewers in the United States.

==Winners and nominees==
The nominees for the 73rd Academy Awards were announced on February 13, 2001, by Robert Rehme, president of the Academy, and Academy Award-winning actress Kathy Bates. &quot;Gladiator&quot; received the most nominations with twelve. &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; came in second with ten.

The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 25, 2001. &quot;Gladiator&quot; became the first film to win Best Picture without a directing or screenwriting win since 1949&#x27;s &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;. Best Director winner Steven Soderbergh, who received nominations for both &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and &quot;Traffic&quot; (for which he won the award), was the third person to receive double directing nominations in the same year. &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; became the third film nominated simultaneously for Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film in the same year. With four wins, the film is tied with &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, &quot;Parasite&quot;, and &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; as the most awarded foreign language films in Academy Awards history. By virtue of his brother&#x27;s Best Supporting Actor nomination for 1988&#x27;s &quot;Running on Empty&quot;, Best Supporting Actor nominee Joaquin Phoenix and River became the first pair of brothers to earn acting nominations.

==Ceremony information==
Despite earning both critical praise and increased viewership from last year&#x27;s ceremony, actor Billy Crystal announced that he would not host the ceremony for a second consecutive year. He listed his role in the film &quot;America&#x27;s Sweethearts&quot; and his directing and producing duties for the made-for-television film &quot;61*&quot; as obstacles preventing him from reprising his role as emcee. Shortly after being selected as producer for the awards gala, Gil Cates hired actor and comedian Steve Martin as host for the 2001 telecast. Cates explained his choice of Martin as host saying, &quot;He&#x27;s a movie star, he&#x27;s funny, he&#x27;s classy, he&#x27;s literate — he&#x27;ll be a wonderful host.&quot; Additionally, AMPAS president Robert Rehme approved of the selection stating, &quot;Steve is a man of great style. I am simply elated to have him on board. He was at the top of our list, we offered and he accepted; it was as simple as that.&quot; Martin expressed his delight in hosting the gala jokingly retorting, &quot;If you can&#x27;t win &#x27;em, join &#x27;em.&quot;

In view of the gala taking place in the year 2001, Cates christened the show with a theme saluting the Stanley Kubrick science fiction film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. In tandem with the theme, astronauts Susan J. Helms, Yury Usachov, and James S. Voss who were inside the International Space Station Alpha Destiny module during Expedition 2 appeared at the beginning of the telecast via satellite to introduce host Martin. Throughout the broadcast, the orchestra conducted by film composer Bill Conti performed a remixed version of &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001)&quot; composed by Brazilian jazz musician Eumir Deodato. Furthermore, &quot;2001&quot; author Arthur C. Clarke presented the Best Adapted Screenplay award from his home in Sri Lanka.

Several others participated in the production of the ceremony. Production designer Roy Christopher designed a new stage for the show which featured gigantic louvered cove that curved from the stage floor to the ceiling via the auditorium&#x27;s backstage wall. Many media outlets described the set design resembling a cross section of a space capsule. In addition, four stainless steel arcs each carved with a silhouette of the Oscar statuette were flanked at the front and back of the stage allowing presenters and winners to pass through them. Dancer Debbie Allen choreographed the performances of the Best Original Song nominees. Musicians Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman performed excerpts from the five nominees for Best Original Score.

===Box office performance of nominees===
Before the nominees were announced on February 13, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees was $471 million with an average of $94 million per film. &quot;Gladiator&quot; was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $186.6 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; ($125.5 million), &quot;Traffic&quot; ($71.2 million), &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; ($60.7 million) and finally, &quot;Chocolat&quot; ($27 million).

Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 49 nominations went to 15 films on the list. Only &quot;Cast Away&quot; (3rd), &quot;Gladiator&quot; (4th), &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (12th), &quot;Traffic&quot; (31st), and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (41st) directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (1st), &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (5th), &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; (7th), &quot;The Patriot&quot; (17th), &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (23rd), &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; (25th), &quot;U-571&quot; (26th), &quot;Hollow Man&quot; (30th), &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; (38th), and &quot;The Cell&quot; (40th).

===Critical reviews===
The show received a positive reception from most media outlets. Television critic Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;As host, Martin was typically dapper and comfortably low-key, pacing himself throughout the evening.&quot; He also added, &quot;The Oscars seemed as bouncy and well oiled as Russell Crowe&#x27;s &#x27;do—a &#x27;50s Gene Vincent-style quiff that made for a cool rock &amp; roll segue into Dylan&#x27;s Best Song performance.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; critic Robert Bianco gave an average review of the telecast but commended the host stating, &quot;Martin was a droll delight — as amusing as Oscar star Billy Crystal, but in an entirely different way. Where Crystal was all hard work and good humor, the more deadpan and deceptively proper Martin let his nastier jokes sneak up on you.&quot; Tom Shales from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commented Martin was &quot;the best Oscar host since Johnny Carson.&quot; In addition, he quipped that &quot;The show was almost too dignified for its own good, yet it remained exciting and entertaining even at its loftier and more pretentious moments.&quot;

Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Barry Garron of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented, &quot;Here was veteran producer Gil Cates presiding over one of the few Academy Award presentations that ended on time and still managed to be too long.&quot; Additionally, he quipped &quot;If nothing else, tonight&#x27;s show proved that, despite the many Awards most viewers have no interest in, the show can be done in three and a half hours.&quot; &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; columnist Steve Murray remarked, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just that Martin lacked the impish, insider energy of Billy Crystal – or even Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s hypnotically awful self-satisfaction. No, the 73rd annual Academy Awards still seemed to go on forever, even though it was one of the shortest in years.&quot; Television critic John Carman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;Even with a rookie host, Steve Martin, the Academy Awards show was long on decorum and disappointingly short on verve.&quot;

===Ratings and reception===
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 42.9 million people over its length, which was a 7% decrease from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony. An estimated 72.2 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 26.2% of households watching over a 40 share. In addition, it garnered a lower 1849 demo rating with a 17.8 rating among viewers in that demographic.

In July 2001, the ceremony presentation received eight nominations at the 53rd Primetime Emmys. Two months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Variety Or Music Series Or Special (Edward J. Greene, Tom Vicari, Bob Douglass).

<text>The Minstrel (11 March 1974 – 3 September 1990) was a Canadian-bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. Bred in Ontario, he was sold as a yearling and exported to Europe, where he was campaigned in Ireland and the United Kingdom. As a two-year-old The Minstrel was unbeaten in three races, including the Dewhurst Stakes, but lost two of his first three starts in 1977. He was then moved up in distance and won his remaining three races: the Epsom Derby, the Irish Derby and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes.

These performances led to The Minstrel becoming horse of the year in the UK and later being inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The Minstrel spent his stud career in the United States, where he had considerable success as a sire of winners.

==Background==
The Minstrel, a &quot;stocky&quot; chestnut colt with a white blaze, four white stockings and a gentle disposition, was foaled at E. P. Taylor&#x27;s Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. He was the son of Northern Dancer out of Fleur, a daughter of Victoria Park. The horse was a three-quarter-brother to the 1970 English Triple Crown champion Nijinsky (who was by Northern Dancer out of Flaming Page, the dam of Fleur).

The Minstrel was purchased for $200,000 ($ million inflation adjusted) at the 1975 Keeneland Sales yearling auction by the British Bloodstock Agency (based in Ireland), acting on behalf of a group headed by Robert Sangster (1936–2004). The colt was shipped to Ireland under trainer Vincent O&#x27;Brien and ridden by champion jockey Lester Piggott.

==Racing career==

===1976: two-year-old season===
As a two-year-old The Minstrel won the six furlong Moy Stakes at the Curragh on his debut and then moved up in class to win the Group Three Larkspur Stakes over seven furlongs at Leopardstown. In October he was sent to England to contest the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. Ridden by Piggott, he started 6/5 favourite against ten opponents and won by four lengths from Saros. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain, he was given a rating of 123 pounds, eight pounds below the top-rated J O Tobin.

===1977: three-year-old season===
In the spring of 1977, The Minstrel was campaigned over one mile. He won the 2000 Guineas Trial on heavy ground at Ascot Racecourse on 2 April. Four weeks later, he started 6/5 favourite for The 2000 Guineas Stakes but after recovering from a poor start he appeared to be beaten for speed in the closing stages as he finished third of the eighteen runners behind Nebbiolo and Tachypous. In the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh on 14 May he finished strongly to reverse the form with Nebbiolo but was beaten a short head by Pampapaul. Despite two classic defeats, Piggott retained his belief in the colt and told O&#x27;Brien and Sangster that &quot;If you run The Minstrel in the Derby, I&#x27;ll ride him.&quot;

The Minstrel was then moved up in distance to contest the 198th running of the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Ridden as usual by Piggott, he started at odds of 5/1 in a field of twenty-two runners, with the French-trained Blushing Groom being made 9/4 favourite. Vincent O&#x27;Brien, as usual, left nothing to chance, stuffing cotton wool in the horse&#x27;s ears until he got to the start – the first recorded example of this calming influence being used. The Minstrel was not among the early leaders but moved forward to take third place at the turn into the straight. Approaching the final quarter mile he moved up to challenge the leader Hot Grove, ridden by Willie Carson. The two colts raced side by side throughout the closing stages before The Minstrel gained the advantage in the last strides and prevailed by neck. Blushing Groom was five length further back in third. The Minstrel&#x27;s success was a fifth in the race for Vincent O&#x27;Brien and a record eighth for Piggott. At the end of the month The Minstrel followed up with a win in the Irish Derby at the Curragh, beating Lucky Sovereign by one and a half lengths and surviving an objection by the rider of the runner-up.

In July The Minstrel raced against older horses for the first time in Britain&#x27;s most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot. The race attracted a strong international field including Bruni, Exceller, Crystal Palace (Prix du Jockey Club) and Crow (St Leger). Piggott settled the colt in the middle of the field before moving up on the outside in the straight to challenge for the lead. He caught the British-trained five-year-old Orange Bay inside the final furlong and held on by a short head in a photo finish as Orange Bay rallied strongly.

In August a half-share in the colt was sold back to his breeder for $4,500,000. The threat of import restrictions following an outbreak of metritis in Europe led to The Minstrel&#x27;s owners abandoning plans to run him in the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe and he was sent to the United States almost immediately.

By the end of his racing career, out of his nine starts The Minstrel won seven races, finishing second and third once each.

==Assessment and honours==
In the 1977 poll organised by the Racegoers&#x27; Club, The Minstrel took twenty-six of the thirty-seven votes to win the title of British Horse of the Year. In the same year he was given a rating of a 135 by the independent Timeform organisation, making him the second highest-rated horse in Europe, two pounds behind his stable companion Alleged. In their book &quot;A Century of Champions&quot;, John Randall and Tony Morris rated The Minstrel a &quot;superior&quot; Derby winner and the sixteenth best Irish racehorse of the 20th century.

==Stud record==
The Minstrel was re-acquired by Windfields Farm and syndicated for $9 million to stand at stud in Maryland. After the sale of Windfields Farm&#x27;s Maryland division in 1988, The Minstrel was sent to Overbrook Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.

The Minstrel&#x27;s son Palace Music won the Champion Stakes in 1984 and had an international impact at stud, siring the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Cigar and the leading Australian runner Naturalism.

A daughter of The Minstrel, Zaizafon, was the dam of Zafonic who won the 2000 Guineas in 1993.

Other Group One winners sired by The Minstrel included:

* L&#x27;Emigrant, foaled 1980 (won Poule d&#x27;Essai des Poulains)
* Treizieme, 1981 (Grand Critérium)
* Bakharoff, 1983 (William Hill Futurity)
* Minstrella, 1984 (Phoenix Stakes, Moyglare Stud Stakes, Cheveley Park Stakes)
* Melodist, 1985 (Oaks d&#x27;Italia, Irish Oaks)
* Silver Fling, 1985 (Prix de l&#x27;Abbaye)
* Musical Bliss, 1986 (1000 Guineas)
* Opening Verse, 1986 (Breeders&#x27; Cup Mile)

The Minstrel was euthanised at a veterinary clinic in Lexington on 3 September 1990 and buried at Overbrook Farm.

<doc id="633172" wikidata="Q725011" url="?curid=633172" title="Neoclassical metal">
<text>Neoclassical metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that is heavily influenced by classical music and usually features very technical playing, consisting of elements borrowed from both classical and speed metal music. Yngwie Malmsteen became one of the most notable musicians in the subgenre, and contributed greatly to the development of the style in the 1980s. Other notable players in the genre are Randy Rhoads, Luca Turilli, Michael Romeo, Jason Becker, Vinnie Moore, Alexi Laiho, Jani Liimatainen, Kiko Loureiro, Uli Jon Roth, Stéphan Forté, Wolf Hoffmann, Timo Tolkki, Syu and Marty Friedman.

Although the genre is mainly associated with guitarists (especially lead guitarists), keyboardists like Jens Johansson, Michael Pinnella, Alex Staropoli and Janne Wirman are also found playing in this style.

== Definition ==
Neoclassical metal takes its name from a broad conception of classical music. In this it is a concept distinct from how neoclassicism is understood within the classical music tradition. Neoclassical music usually refers to a movement in musical modernism which developed roughly a century after the end of the Classical period and peaked during the years between the two World Wars.

On the other hand, neoclassical metal music does not restrict itself to a return to classical aesthetic ideals, such as equilibrium and formalism. Its influences include both the Romantic musical period and the Baroque period of the seventeenth and first half of the eighteenth centuries. The music of late Baroque composers such as Vivaldi, Handel and Bach was often highly ornate. Neoclassical metal musicians such as Yngwie Malmsteen and Joshua Perahia are inspired by this aspect of Baroque music and also by later composers such as the violinist Niccolò Paganini in using runs and other decorative and showy techniques in their performances.
Neoclassical metal music thus looks to classical music as broadly understood by the general public and not to the more specialist technical definition used within classical circles.

== History of the genre and influences ==

In the 1960s and 1970s, there were many works that influenced this subgenre, Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot; being the most important one. Other bands, like Rainbow, also featured neoclassical influences. Early classical influences within hard rock and heavy metal are most notably found in the playing of Jon Lord, Keith Emerson, Ritchie Blackmore, Uli Jon Roth and Randy Rhoads. But it was in the 1980s when neoclassical metal became a distinct subgenre.

Heavy metal guitar technique developed rapidly from its late-1960s beginnings to its late-1980s peak, but before the 1980s, few metal guitarists displayed the advanced technical proficiency which is a hallmark of the neoclassical metal style. The popularization and growth of neoclassical metal is closely related to the ascension of the guitar &quot;shredding&quot; movement.

The &quot;golden age&quot; of neoclassical metal in the middle to late 1980s revolved around the sizeable roster of flashy electric-guitar soloists who recorded mostly instrumental albums for Mike Varney&#x27;s Shrapnel Records label. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, widely regarded as the originator and still-reigning king of neoclassical metal, was brought to the United States by Varney to sign with Shrapnel Records in 1982.

Many subsequent Shrapnel artists, including Tony MacAlpine, Vinnie Moore, Joey Tafolla, Michael Angelo Batio, Paul Gilbert, David T. Chastain, Jason Becker, and Marty Friedman, emerged in the latter 1980s as exemplars of the neoclassical style.

== Styles and theory ==
A common feature of neoclassical metal is the diminished seventh chord. It can be a useful tool for modulation, as it&#x27;s possible to move by minor thirds through the chord, then use the diminished 7th as a leading tone to resolve to the tonic. Pentatonic scales are also prevalent (as in the vast majority of rock and metal styles). A scale often used by neoclassical metal musicians is the harmonic minor scale, which is similar to the natural minor, but has a raised 7th (in the case of E, the D goes to D).

Modes are also used on occasion.

<text>Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath) is a subgenre of death metal that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often borrowing from traditional heavy metal (including New Wave of British Heavy Metal). The genre features the heaviness of death metal but with highly melodic or harmonized guitar riffs and solos, and often features high-pitched shrieked vocals (differing from traditional death metal) alongside the low-pitched growls commonly featured in traditional death metal. Pioneered by the English heavy metal band Carcass with their 1993 album &quot;Heartwork&quot;, melodic death metal developed further in Sweden (developed by bands like At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity, and In Flames) in the mid-1990s. The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularise the style, soon centering in the &quot;Gothenburg metal&quot; scene. At the Gates&#x27; &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot;, Dark Tranquillity&#x27;s &quot;The Gallery&quot;, and In Flames&#x27; &quot;The Jester Race&quot;, all released in the mid-1990s, were highly influential albums in melodic death metal, with At the Gates and In Flames being the two most common influences on North American 2000s heavy metal bands. Many American heavy metal bands emulated At the Gates&#x27; sound, resulting in the usage of the phrase &quot;At the Gates worship&quot;.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, many melodic death metal bands emerged, including Children of Bodom, Arch Enemy, Amon Amarth, The Black Dahlia Murder, Insomnium, and Soilwork. In the 2000s decade, melodic death metal achieved popularity among heavy metal fans, starting with the release of In Flames&#x27; 2002 album &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot;, which showed a change to a more eclectic sound while retaining the band&#x27;s melodic death metal sound. Many other melodic death metal bands quickly had chart success.

In the mid-2000s, melodic metalcore, a subgenre of metalcore that combines the genre with melodic death metal, achieved popularity with the chart success and sales success of bands like Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, and As I Lay Dying. Deathcore bands during this time period like Bring Me the Horizon and Through the Eyes of the Dead also were influenced by melodic death metal and achieved popularity.

==Musical characteristics==
Melodic death metal combines death metal with elements of traditional heavy metal ranging as far as the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, especially melodic or harmonized guitar riffs, with the heavily distorted guitars, fast double-bass drum patterns and occasional blast beats of death metal. The vocal style typically features either high-pitched shrieks screaming (differing from traditional death metal) or low-pitched growling (similar to traditional death metal) and can feature clean sung vocals. Unlike traditional death metal, melodic death metal is more prone to using verse-chorus song structures.

==History==

===Origins (early–mid 1990s)===

Much of the origin and popularity of melodic death metal can be attributed to the bands At the Gates, In Flames, and Dark Tranquillity, whose mid 1990s music releases (namely &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot;, &quot;The Jester Race&quot;, and &quot;The Gallery&quot;, respectively) defined the genre and laid the foundation for the Gothenburg metal scene. Writer Gary Sharpe-Young considered the Gothenburg scene the commercial salvation of death metal: &quot;Gothenburg became the new Tampa and the genre received a new lease on life.&quot; The titular melodic elements can be traced to traditional Scandinavian musical motifs. Another pioneer was the English band Carcass, which performed grindcore on its first two releases but morphed into death metal and an increasingly melodic style on the &quot;Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious&quot; (1991) and &quot;Heartwork&quot; (1993). Death&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Symbolic&quot; is also considered to be influential in the development of the genre. Ceremonial Oath and Eucharist also are early melodic death metal bands; however, they never gained much attention outside of their own scene.

In Flames&#x27; &quot;The Jester Race&quot; combined death metal with guitar riffs heavily influenced by bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. The album&#x27;s sound heavily contrasted with traditional death metal, and made Swedish death metal more accessible to more people compared to other Swedish death metal albums that pioneered a new sound, including the death &#x27;n&#x27; roll of Entombed&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine Blues&quot;. At the Gates&#x27; &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; influenced many American metal bands, especially metalcore bands who used guitar riffs and vocals emulating At the Gates&#x27; music. The vocals also were noted by AllMusic for being more decipherable than other death metal vocals, resembling high-pitched shrieks that foreshadowed 2000s American screamo bands. The album brought At the Gates underground popularity, including rotation on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbanger&#x27;s Ball&quot;, a nomination at the Swedish Grammys, and American tours with Morbid Angel and Napalm Death.

===Expansion (Late 1990s and early 2000s)===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, melodic death metal quickly expanded with many bands emerging, including Amon Amarth, The Black Dahlia Murder, Arch Enemy, Soilwork, Insomnium, and Children of Bodom. Additionally, other genres would begin using melodic death metal as an influence, including melodic metalcore and melodic black/death. Stewart Mason claims that melodic metalcore has become very popular in the United States, using the term &quot;Swedecore&quot; to describe Scandinavian-style metal as played by non-Nordic bands. Many melodic death metal and metalcore bands (especially after melodic metalcore band Killswitch Engage rose in popularity) were heavily influenced by &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; by At the Gates and had an influence of them in their music. Many heavy metal bands in the mid-2000s, in turn, were labeled &quot;At the Gates worship&quot;.

===Popularity and emergence of melodic metalcore (2000s)===

In the 2000s, melodic death metal became popular among heavy metal fans. In 2002, In Flames&#x27; album &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; peaked at number 10 on the Top Heatseekers chart. The album, retaining the band&#x27;s melodic death metal sound, showed a diverse mix of different musical genres, including occasional electronica and hip hop synthesizers and occasional clean singing. This helped gain the band a new amount of fans while alienating fans of In Flames&#x27; early work. In Flames&#x27; next two albums, &quot;Soundtrack to Your Escape&quot; (2004) and &quot;Come Clarity&quot; (2006), peaked at numbers 145 and 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, respectively, with the latter album giving In Flames a Swedish Grammy Award. The Black Dahlia Murder, Arch Enemy, Children of Bodom, and Amon Amarth also enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 during the 2000s decade. In the mid–late 2000s, melodic metalcore became one of the most popular heavy metal genres, with bands like Killswitch Engage, Unearth, Bullet for My Valentine, All That Remains, Shadows Fall and Atreyu achieving success, headlining major festivals and selling a lot of records. Melodic metalcore combined melodic death metal elements like melodic guitar riffs and screaming with elements of the original style of metalcore like breakdowns. At the Gates and In Flames were major influences on these bands. Killswitch Engage are often credited as the band that brought melodic metalcore into the mainstream among heavy metal fans. Some deathcore bands during this time, such as Through the Eyes of the Dead and Bring Me the Horizon, combined deathcore with melodic death metal.

==Subgenres==

Many melodic death metal bands began being inspired by black metal and European romanticism. This style has been referred to as blackened melodic death metal, melodic blackened death metal and However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre would incorporate an increased sense of melody and narrative.

Melodic metalcore is a fusion genre, incorporating elements of metalcore and melodic death metal, with a heavy emphasis on melodic instrumentation, blast beats, metalcore-stylized breakdowns and clean singing. These bands often take influence from the guitar riffs and writing styles of Swedish melodic death metal bands, especially At the Gates, In Flames, Arch Enemy and Soilwork.

<text>Janet Horowitz Murray (born 1946) is an American professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Before coming to Georgia Tech in 1999, she was a Senior Research Scientist in the Center for Educational Computing Initiatives at MIT, where she taught humanities and led advanced interactive design projects since 1971. She is well known as an early developer of humanities computing applications, a seminal theorist of digital media, and an advocate of new educational programs in digital media.

==Work and contributions==
Janet Murray designed projects include a digital edition of the Warner Brothers classic, Casablanca. In addition she directs an eTV Prototyping Group, which has worked on interactive television applications for PBS, ABC, MTV, Turner, and other networks. She also works extensively as a member of Georgia Tech&#x27;s Experimental Game Lab and is an advisor to Georgia Tech&#x27;s Mobile Technology Group.

Murray&#x27;s major book is &quot;Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace&quot;, which asks whether the computer can provide the basis for an expressive narrative form, just as print technology supported the development of the novel and film technology supported the development of movies (originally published in 1997 and updated in 2017). She provides an optimistic answer. Murray’s analysis rests on an understanding of the computer as a medium of representation with a distinct set of properties. She argues that the computer is procedural, participatory, encyclopedic, and spatial, and that it affords three characteristic (but not unique) pleasures: immersion, agency, and transformation. She defines interactivity as the combination of the procedural and the participatory property which together afford the pleasure of agency. She connects research work on artificial intelligence with cultural forms such as games, movies, literature, and television. Murray’s main point is that the new computer formats expand the possibilities of expression available for storytelling. To her, &quot;digital transmission has opened up the possibility of long-form storytelling, since audiences can view whole seasons after their original broadcast date, and they can follow story over multiple seasons.&quot;

Murray was a guest writer for Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort &quot;The New Media Reader&quot;, an anthology of articles on the new media which Janet was the first of the two introduction in the book called &quot;Inventing the Medium.&quot;

Murray’s work has been referenced by game designers, interactive television producers, filmmakers, and journalists. It has been criticized from opposing directions, by writer Sven Birkerts as a threat to print culture (in &quot;HotWired&quot; magazine and in a televised debate) and by ludologists as an inappropriately literary approach to games (&quot;Game Studies&quot; vol. 1 no. 1). Murray has been described as a narratologist as she advocates for storytelling in gameplay.

Murray also has an active role in developing two new degree programs at Georgia Tech which were launched in 2004: the Ph.D. in digital media and the B.S. in Computational Media. She was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 2007 to 2013.

==Accomplishments==
* Spring of 2000, American Film Institute named Janet Murray their Trustee as she is also a mentor AFI Digital Content Lab.
* Her projects from digital media curricula, interactive narrative, story/games, interactive television, to large-scale multimedia information spaces.have been funded by IBM, Apple Computer, Annenberg-CPB Project, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National Science Foundation.
* Next Generation Magazine named her one of the top 100 Most Influential Women in Games in 2006

<doc id="633178" wikidata="Q465978" url="?curid=633178" title="Extreme metal">
<text>Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a &quot;cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal, and visual &quot;.

The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, black metal, death metal, and doom metal genres. Hardcore punk has been considered an integral part of the development of extreme metal in song structure and speed, apart from the case of doom metal.

== Definitions ==
Extreme metal acts set themselves apart from traditional heavy metal acts, such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Motörhead, by incorporating more abrasive musical characteristics such as higher tempos, increased aggression and a harsher extremity. In the majority of the world, extreme metal does not receive much radio-play or achieve high chart positions.

Extreme metal&#x27;s sonic excess is characterized by high levels of distortion (also in the vocals – growling, gargling or screaming), less focus on guitar solos and melody, emphasis on technical control, and fast tempos (at times, more than 200 beats per minute). Its thematic transgression can be found in more overt and/or serious references to Satanism and the darker aspects of human existence that are considered out of bounds or distasteful, such as death, suicide and war. &quot;Visual transgression [can include] ... medieval weaponry [and] bloody/horrific artwork.&quot;

According to ethnographer Keith Kahn-Harris, the defining characteristics of extreme metal can all be regarded as clearly transgressive: the &quot;extreme&quot; traits noted above are all intended to violate or transgress given cultural, artistic, social or aesthetic boundaries. Kahn-Harris states that extreme metal can be &quot;close to being ... formless noise&quot;, at least to the uninitiated listener. He states that with extreme metal lyrics, they often &quot;offer no possibility of hope or redemption&quot; and lyrics often reference apocalyptic themes. Extreme metal lyrics often describe Christianity as weak or submissive, and many songs express misanthropic views such as &quot;kill every thing&quot;. A small number of extreme metal bands and song lyrics take radical (left or right) political stances; for example, the Swedish black metal band Marduk has commonly referenced the Nazi Panzer tanks, which can be seen in works such as &quot;Panzer Division Marduk&quot; (1999).

==History==

The British band Venom are one of the first bands to venture into extreme metal territory, due to their ideological shift into themes of evil, the devil and hell. Their first two albums, &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot; (1981) and &quot;Black Metal&quot; (1982), were a major influence on thrash metal and extreme metal in general. This early work by Venom, in combination with bands like Discharge, the Exploited and Amebix, as well as American hardcore punk, brought integral elements into the budding extreme metal landscape at the time.

In 1983, Metallica would release their debut album &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, which fused elements of the new wave of British heavy metal with hardcore punk and the style of Motörhead, becoming the first thrash metal album, and would eventually be certified triple platinum. A few months later, Slayer would release their own thrash metal album &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;, influenced by the sounds of Venom, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Mercyful Fate.

When extreme metal band Hellhammer first began making music, it was generally panned by critics, leading to the members forming Celtic Frost in its place, which proved very influential on the progression of the genre. During this period, the line between extreme metal genres were blurred, as thrash metal bands such as Slayer, Sepultura, Sodom, Destruction and Kreator were integral to the first wave black metal scene. The front cover of the Sarcófago&#x27;s 1987 debut album, &quot;I.N.R.I.&quot;, was a major influence on black metal&#x27;s corpse paint style make-up. That record is also considered one of the first wave black metal albums that helped shape the genre. Their second album, &quot;The Laws of Scourge&quot;, was one of the first technical death metal records to be released.

<text>The arghul (), also spelled argul, arghoul, arghool, argol, or yarghul, is a musical instrument in the reed family. It has been used since ancient Egyptian times and is still used as a traditional instrument in Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Jordan.

==Basic characteristics==

&quot;Modern Egyptians&quot;.)
Modern Arghul, 3 ft. 2½ in. long.
The arghul is a double-pipe, Single-reed woodwind instrument that consists of two tubes: a melody pipe with between five and seven holes and a longer drone (Arabic &quot;ardiyya&quot;, &quot;ground&quot;) pipe. Its tone is similar to that of a clarinet, although a bit more reed-like. Unlike the similar mijwiz, the arghul has fingering holes on only one of the instrument&#x27;s pipes (the melody pipe), and the drone pipe has a detachable length that allows the player to alter the pitch of the drone.

In the illustration above
all three lengths are shown in use. An arghul belonging to the
collection of the Conservatoire Royal at Brussels, described by
Victor Mahillon in his catalogue (No. 113), gives the following
scale: —

Arghuls are used in Egypt, Palestine and other Arab nations as an accompaniment to belly dancing, Dabke, and other types of Arabic musical performances. Circular breathing is an important part of the playing of the instrument.

There are three varieties of arghuls: the small arghul (&quot;arghoul alasghar&quot;), the medium arghul (&quot;arghoul alsoghayr&quot;), and the large arghul (&quot;arghoul alkebir&quot;).

==Çifte==
Çifte is a Turkish folk instrument of the wind type. It is made by tying two reed pipes side by side. Two small reed pieces which produce the sound are added to the ends of both reeds. These two small reeds are taken into the mouth cavity and it is played by blowing the air into both at the same time.

There are two çifte types known as Demli Çifte and Demsiz Çifte. In demli çifte one of the reeds does not have any pitch keys and it just produces a drone. There are melody keys on the other reed and the main melody is played through them.

Çifte is also known as Argun, Argul, Kargın or Zambır at different regions.

In Turkish, the word &quot;çifte&quot; also refers to a double-barreled shotgun, no doubt because of the barrels&#x27; resemblance to the wind instrument.

==Dozaleh==
:&quot;See main article: Dozaleh&quot;
The &quot;dozaleh&quot; is one of the old folk wind instruments of Iran which is used in mirth celebrations.
Abu Nasr Farabi had called it Mezmarol-Mosana or Mozdavadg [mozdavej] (&quot;married&quot;). The &quot;dozaleh&quot; has a sound like Ney-anbān [neianbAn] (bagpipe), but to some extent more clear and lower. It is played in Khorasan [xorAsAn], Kermanshah [KermAnSAh], and mostly in Iran. In some different dialects it is called Zanbooreh [zanbureh].

<text>The United Front Work Department (UFWD) is a department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) tasked with &quot;united front work&quot;. It gathers intelligence on, manages relations with, and attempts to gain influence over elite individuals and organizations inside and outside mainland China, including in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and in other countries.

The UFWD focuses its work on people or entities that are outside the CCP, especially in the overseas Chinese diaspora, who hold political, commercial, or academic influence, or who represent interest groups. Through its efforts, the UFWD seeks to ensure that these individuals and groups are supportive of or useful to CCP interests and that potential critics remain divided.

== History ==
The United Front Work Department was created during the Chinese Civil War, and was reestablished in 1979 under paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Since 2012, the role and scope of the UFWD has expanded and intensified under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping.

===Civil war and gaining power===
United front policies were most used in two periods before the Chinese Communist Revolution, namely from 1924 to 1927, and from 1936 to 1945, when the CCP cooperated with the Nationalist Party ostensibly to defeat the Japanese. The simplest formulation of united front work in the period was to &quot;rally as many allies as possible in order to...defeat a common enemy.&quot; According to Mareike Ohlberg, its stated goal was to &quot;build the broadest possible coalition with all social forces that are relevant&quot;.

In the early years, the CCP also used united front policies to cooperate with &quot;disaffected warlords, religious believers, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and minor parties and groups,&quot; in order for the CCP to appear democratic and to persuade key groups that the Nationalists were &quot;illegitimate and repressive while the CCP embodied progress, unity, and democracy.&quot;

After seizing power, the CCP continued to deploy united front strategies to train intellectuals, &quot;and, using thought reform based on criticism, began the transformation of the old society intellectuals.&quot; This involved violent elimination of what were termed &quot;bourgeois and idealistic political beliefs,&quot; to instill faith in &quot;class struggle and revolutionary change.&quot;

=== Cultural Revolution ===
During the Cultural Revolution, the UFWD was accused of being &quot;capitulationist&quot; and forced to shut down.

===Reform-era===
In the late 1970s the policy was used for the common cause of economic reform. From there the CCP expanded the scope of its work internationally during the reform era, and again following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. The department includes a bureau tasked with handling Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas affairs, and articulates the importance of using overseas Chinese populations to promote unification. 

In 1980, the CCP Central Committee approved a request by the UFWD to create a national conference for religious groups. The participating religious groups were the Catholic Patriotic Association, the Islamic Association of China, the Chinese Taoist Association, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, and the Buddhist Association of China.

It played an important role in building support for &quot;One country, two systems&quot; in Hong Kong during the 1980s and 1990s, operating under the name of the &quot;Coordination Department.&quot; The UFWD has been critically described as serving to co-opt non-Communist community leaders outside China, and &quot;using them to neutralize Party critics,&quot; sometimes coercively.

Scholar of Chinese political history John P. Burns presents in his book &quot;The Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s Nomenklatura System&quot; excerpts from internal party documents demonstrating the role of the UFWD. The UFWD is to &quot;implement better the party&#x27;s united front policy and to assess and understand patriotic personages in different fields... so that we can arrange for correct placements for them and fully mobilize and bring into play their positive role in the Four Modernizations and to accomplish the return of Taiwan to the motherland so as to fulfill the cause of uniting the whole country, and to carry forward and solidify the revolutionary, patriotic united front.&quot;

The UFWD was used in the early years of PRC rule &quot;to guarantee CCP oversight&quot; over groups that were not directly associated with the Party and government. Those groups, including NGOs, were brought under the authority of the UFWD, whose job it was to “continuing to play its part in mobilizing and rallying the whole people in common struggle” after the Liberation in 1949. When the CCP &quot;shifted its focus from the &#x27;mass line&#x27; to &#x27;class struggle&#x27;, the real united front disappeared. While the United Front Department still existed, its duties of uniting with all forces for the &#x27;common struggle&#x27; shifted mainly to serving the Party&#x27;s leadership and &#x27;consolidating the proletarian dictatorship&#x27;,&quot; according to Brookings Institution visiting fellow Zhang Ye. According to Roger Faligot, the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre led to the &quot;growing use of party organizations, such as the United Front Work Department and friendship associations, as fronts for intelligence operations.&quot; Based on their actions in Taiwan and elsewhere the United Front Work Department appears to be used as a cover to conduct intelligence operations against targets of interest to the CCP.

=== Xi administration ===
In 2018, the United Front Work Department went through a reorganization in which it absorbed the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA) and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO) to become two internal bureaus. As part of the &quot;one institution with two names&quot; system, the UFWD retains OCAO and SARA (also called National Religious Affairs Administration) as external nameplates. The UFWD also assumed direct control of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. With the reorganization, the UFWD effectively became China&#x27;s main agency overseeing and managing ethnic, religious and overseas Chinese affairs. The State Religious Affairs Commission and the State Council Overseas Chinese Office were also merged within the United Front Work Department.

==Structure==
The UFWD is reported to have over 40,000 personnel and does not disclose its budget. However, it was estimated to have a budget of at least US$2.6 billion in 2019. It oversees and directs eight minor and subordinate political parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Huaqiao University is directly under the UFWD.

Between 2015 and 2018, the UFWD grew to 12 bureaus:
* General Office (): Oversees the functioning of the department, including its finances, security, assets, and work with other government and Party bodies.
* Policy and Theory Research Office (): Handles ideological and policy research, internal propaganda, and the drafting of important documents. Works with other government agencies to develop propaganda efforts abroad.
* First Bureau—Party Work Bureau (一局，党派工作局): Governs affairs related to the eight minor political parties legally allowed to operate in China.
* Second Bureau—Minority and Religious Work Bureau (二局，民族工作局): Researches and recommends policy on minorities in the country, and liaises with other government agencies in their related work. Also supervises religious work.
* Third Bureau—Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan United Front Work Bureau (三局，港澳台统战工作局): Coordinates and communicates with friendly figures in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
* Fourth Bureau—Non-public Economic Work Bureau (四局，非公有制经济工作局): Coordinates with figures from the private sector.
* Fifth Bureau—Independent and Non-Party Intellectuals Work Bureau (五局，无党派、党外知识分子工作局): Liaises with intellectuals not formally affiliated with the Communist Party.
* Sixth Bureau—New Social Class Representatives Work Bureau (六局，新的社会阶层人士工作局): Focuses on the &quot;new social class&quot;, i.e., the rising Chinese middle class.
* Seventh Bureau (): Responsible for ethnic minority and religious work, particularly as it relates to Tibet.
* Eighth Bureau (): Responsible for ethnic minority and religious work, particularly as it relates to Xinjiang.
* Ninth Bureau—Overseas Chinese Affairs General Bureau (，侨务综合局): Coordinates and communicates with friendly figures in overseas Chinese affairs. The UFWD&#x27;s Ninth Bureau runs the China Overseas Friendship Association (COFA). COFA and the China Overseas Exchange Association (COEA) merged in 2019.
* Tenth Bureau—Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau (，侨务事务局): Coordinates and communicates with friendly figures in overseas Chinese affairs.
* Eleventh Bureau—Religious Work General Bureau (十一局，宗教综合局): Researches and recommends policy on religious affairs in the country, and liaises with other government agencies in their related work.
* Twelfth Bureau—Religious Work Bureau (十二局，宗教业务局): Researches and recommends policy on religious affairs in the country, and liaises with other government agencies in their related work.
* Department Party Committee ()
* Retired Cadre Office (): responsible for the welfare of retired employees of the department.

==Functions==

The UFWD is tasked with expanding and exerting CCP influence over groups and prominent individuals which have no direct affiliation with the CCP. It engages in a diverse array of social groups including the eight minor political parties legally allowed to operate, ethnic minorities, religious groups, overseas Chinese, private entrepreneurs, professionals in emerging sectors such as social media influencers, and residents of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. It works to maintain communication and provide guidance with these groups, and often rewards the individuals within these groups that are friendly to the CCP. With these methods, the UFWD ensures their alignment with the CCP and additionally gathers policy recommendations and political intelligence.

According to Neil Thomas of Asia Society, UFWD&#x27;s work is primarily domestic, calling it a &quot;domestic apparatus whose tentacles extend beyond China’s borders&quot;. Alex Joske has noted that there is no clear distinction between domestic and overseas UFWD activity and often overlap between the two. Scholar Martin Thorley has described the UFWD as being able to call upon a &quot;latent network&quot; of civic, educational, and non-governmental groups and affiliated individuals internally and abroad for its political purposes, especially in times of crisis. For instance, the UFWD uses members of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference and other organizations to carry out influence-building activities, often covertly. Researchers from Stanford University&#x27;s Internet Observatory and the Hoover Institution describe the United Front as &quot;cultivat[ing] pro-Beijing perspectives in the Chinese diaspora and the wider world by rewarding those it deems friendly with accolades and lucrative opportunities, while orchestrating social and economic pressure against critics. This pressure is often intense but indirect, and clear attribution is therefore difficult.&quot;

=== Operations ===
The UFWD gathers intelligence on, manages relations with, and attempts to gain influence over elite individuals and organizations inside and outside mainland China, including in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and in other countries. It uses several methods in pursuit of its goals to appeal to its targets. Its primary method involves outreach, including holding events, trainings, media tours and other similar activities. This includes examples such as inviting members of the &quot;new social class&quot; to attend the &quot;large-scale celebration to commemorate the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone’s 40th anniversary&quot; or inviting members of the private sector to attend a multi-week training course. Another method it uses is to providing good and services, including issuing tenders for infrastructure and development projects, from road improvements to increasing access to drinking water.

The UFWD also plays an active role in the sinicization of non-Han ethnic and religious minorities, particularly in Tibet, Inner Mongolia and of the Uyghurs through the Xinjiang internment camps. In 2020, shortly after the commencement of the 2020 Inner Mongolia protests, the UFWD issued a communique that stressed the need for all ethnic minorities in China to use Standard Chinese. The UFWD has also taken a leading role in antireligious campaigns under the official pretense of &quot;sinicizing religions.&quot; Bureaus of the SARA, absorbed into the UFWD in 2018, in some areas of Gansu, Qinghai and Sichuan have brought PRC flags and flagpoles to install in mosques or temples.

The UFWD and its affiliated front organizations have also served as cover for intelligence agents of the Ministry of State Security. Multiple national intelligence agencies have expressed concern that the mandate and operations of the UFWD can constitute undue interference in other nations&#x27; internal affairs. In their book &quot;Nest of Spies&quot;, de Pierrebourg and Juneau-Katsuya allege that the United Front Work Department &quot;manages important dossiers concerning foreign countries. These include propaganda, the control of Chinese students abroad, the recruiting of agents among the Chinese diaspora (and among sympathetic foreigners), and long-term clandestine operations.&quot;

The Chinese People&#x27;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries has been described as the &quot;public face&quot; of the UFWD. Scholar Jichang Lulu noted that the UFWD and its proxy organizations &quot;re-purpose democratic governance structures to serve as tools of extraterritorial influence.&quot; An &quot;Atlantic&quot; writer stated China runs thousands of linked and subsidized pro-government groups across Europe, to &quot;ensure that its overseas citizens, and others of ethnic Chinese descent, are loyal&quot;, to &quot;shape the conversation about China in Europe&quot;, and to &quot;bring back technology and expertise&quot;, and that the UFWD plays a &quot;crucial&quot; role in this project. Scholar Jeffrey Stoff has argued that the CCP&#x27;s United Front &quot;influence apparatus intersects with or directly supports its global technology transfer apparatus.&quot;

In March 2018, it was announced that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office would be absorbed into the United Front Work Department. With the absorption of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, the UFWD gained full control of the country&#x27;s second largest state-run media apparatus, the China News Service. In 2019, the UFWD partnered with the Cyberspace Administration of China to promote united front work with social media influencers.

In January 2020, UFWD-linked organizations in Canada and other countries were activated to purchase, stockpile, and export personal protective equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China. UFWD-affiliated groups have also been linked to organized crime in several countries.

In October 2024, Swedish reporters working as part of an international consortium of journalists identified 233 individuals across Europe connected to the united front system. According to the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, its research has uncovered 103 united front-linked groups in Sweden spanning all areas of society, including culture, business, politics, and media.

=== Taiwan ===

The UFWD sponsors paid trips and summer camps to mainland China for Taiwanese youth. The trips are reported to promote pro-Chinese unification sentiment. 

=== Foreign electoral interference allegations ===
The UFWD has also allegedly interfered in foreign elections, including the 2019 Canadian federal election. Following the 2019 Canadian Parliament infiltration plot, the Privy Council Office warned that election interference by China was &quot;likely to be more persistent and pervasive in future elections&quot; and that &quot;the UFWD’s extensive network of quasi-official and local community and interest groups, allow it to obfuscate communication and the flow of funds between Canadian targets and Chinese officials.&quot;

== Reaction ==
A 2018 report by the United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission noted that the UFWD regularly attempts to suppress overseas protests and acts of expression critical of the CCP are a conspiracy against rights. In May 2020, the White House released a report titled &quot;U.S. Strategic Approach to the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;. That report stated that &quot;CCP United Front organizations and agents target businesses, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state, and Federal officials in the United States and around the world, attempting to influence discourse and restrict external influence inside the PRC.&quot; In June 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute issued a report advocating a multi-dimensional response involving law enforcement as well as legislative reform for greater transparency of foreign influence operations. The same month the Republican Study Committee in the United States called for sanctions on the UFWD and its top leadership. 

In January 2022, MI5 issued an &quot;interference alert&quot; for a solicitor in the UK named Christine Lee suspected of political interference on behalf of the UFWD. In a February 2022 ruling, a Canadian court stated that the UFWD&#x27;s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office &quot;engages in covert and surreptitious intelligence gathering”. In July 2023, a group of U.S. senators asked the United States Department of Justice to investigate &quot;Overseas Chinese Service Centers&quot; with alleged ties to the UFWD that are operating in seven U.S. cities.

=== U.S. sanctions and prosecution ===

In December 2020, the United States Department of State imposed visa restrictions on &quot;individuals active in United Front Work Department activities, who have engaged in the use or threat of physical violence, theft and release of private information, espionage, sabotage, or malicious interference in domestic political affairs, academic freedom, personal privacy, or business activity.&quot; In January 2021, the head of the UFWD, You Quan, was sanctioned pursuant to Executive Order 13936 as a Specially Designated National by United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control.

In May 2023, a U.S. man, Liang Litang, was indicted for acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government and for surveilling and harassing Chinese dissidents. Liang allegedly passed information to officials of the UFWD and Ministry of Public Security.

== Department heads ==
During two periods the United Front Work Department was without a leader, from 1966 to 1975 during the Cultural Revolution and from the end of 1989 until 22 November 1990 following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. The UFWD has had two female heads, Liu Yandong (2002–2007) and Sun Chunlan (2014–2017).

<text>The Downing Street Declaration was a joint declaration issued on 15 December 1993 by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, John Major, and the Irish Taoiseach (English: Prime Minister), Albert Reynolds, at the British Prime Minister&#x27;s office in 10 Downing Street.

The declaration affirmed both the right of the people of Ireland to self-determination, and that Northern Ireland would be transferred to the Republic of Ireland from the United Kingdom only if a majority of its population was in favour of such a move. It also included, as part of the prospective of the so-called &quot;Irish dimension&quot;, the principle of consent that the people of the island of Ireland had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.

The latter statement, which later would become one of the points of the Good Friday Agreement, was key to produce a positive change of attitude by the republicans towards a negotiated settlement. The joint declaration also pledged the governments to seek a peaceful constitutional settlement, and promised that parties linked with paramilitaries (such as Sinn Féin) could take part in the talks, so long as they abandoned violence.

== Significance ==
The Downing Street Declaration demonstrated to republicans and loyalists that political differences can be &quot;negotiated and resolved exclusively by peaceful political means&quot;. Contrary to the suggestion that an inclusive settlement &quot;would compromise no position or principle&quot;, the history of the declaration had already shown that compromise on all sides was the indispensable foundation of the Northern Ireland peace process.

The declaration, after a meeting between Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams and American congressman Bruce Morrison, which was followed by a joint statement issued by Adams and John Hume, was considered sufficient by the Provisional Irish Republican Army to announce a ceasefire on 31 August 1994 which was then followed on 13 October by an announcement of a ceasefire from the Combined Loyalist Military Command. This ceasefire allowed Sinn Fein to be admitted to the &quot;democratic process&quot;.

The Downing Street Declaration was significant because it addressed major ideological obstacles to peace in Northern Ireland, such as the right of the people of Ireland to self-determination and the principle of consent:

&quot;The British Government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish&quot;.

Indeed, the Declaration addressed the &quot;boundary question&quot; of who would be allowed to vote in a referendum, which it stated the people of the island of Ireland. Therefore, the idea of self-determination gave legitimacy to any constitutional decision taken by the people of the island of Ireland for the people of the island of Ireland. Subsequently, this meant that these issues were generally accepted by the time the Good Friday Agreement negotiations began, and did not significantly stall the 1998 peace agreement.

== The Origins and Negotiation of the Downing Street Declaration ==

=== Father Alec Reid ===
Although the final declaration was a triumph of diplomacy and negotiation between the governments of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, its origins are more complex, and can be traced to the work of the Redemptorist priest, Father Alec Reid. The idea of a joint declaration emerged from his attempts to create a pan-Nationalist front in the late 1980s by bringing John Hume&#x27;s SDLP and members of Fianna Fáil into conversation with Gerry Adams and other Sinn Féin leaders. Reid argued that a declaration by the British government which recognised the right of the Irish people to self-determination would enable a Republican ceasefire and he called for an Irish Peace Conference to &#x27;persuade&#x27; the British government to make such a declaration and to adopt a policy that would allow for the creation of a &#x27;new, independent Ireland&#x27;.

=== Hume-Adams Talks ===
The exercise of self-determination and the role of the British government had been a key component of the Hume-Adams talks in 1988. In the 26-page record of their inter-party dialogue the term &#x27;self-determination&#x27; appeared no fewer than 54 times. While Sinn Fein attributed the essence of the Irish problem to Britain&#x27;s &#x27;colonial interference&#x27;, Hume argued that the British no longer had selfish interest in maintaining their presence in Ireland, and that the focus should instead be on resolving the divisions within Ireland itself over how self-determination was exercised, by persuading and obtaining the consent of the Unionist population for a unified Ireland, something the Sinn Féin delegation described as a &#x27;Unionist veto&#x27;. Hume&#x27;s proposed solution that would enable a divided Ireland to exercise collective self-determination was dual referenda in both the North and the South, a concept that would feature not only in the Downing Street Declaration, but later in the Good Friday Agreement. These early ideas and discussions were refined through Reid&#x27;s dialogue with Martin Mansergh whose commentary on Reid&#x27;s proposals represents one of the earliest attempts to reconcile the &#x27;inalienable right&#x27; of the Irish people to &#x27;the exercise in common of self-determination without external intervention&#x27; with the practical need to seek the consent of &#x27;both parts of Ireland&#x27;.

=== Early Drafts ===
Peter Brooke&#x27;s Whitbread speech in November 1990 gave new impetus to the initiative. Brooke stated publicly, as recommended by Hume, that the &#x27;British Government has no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland&#x27;, wording that would be incorporated into the final declaration. Perhaps buoyed by this initial success and its cautious welcome in Republican circles, in October 1991, Hume went on to draft what is generally accepted to be the first full version of the Joint Declaration, published in Mallie and McKittrick (1996). Borrowing language from earlier Reid papers, the opening paragraphs lamented the &#x27;tragedy and suffering&#x27; caused by the &#x27;legacy of history&#x27; and past failures to resolve the conflict, and committed the two governments to cooperation in the interests of the &#x27;future welfare and prosperity of both parts of Ireland&#x27;. This endeavour is set in the context of broader European integration, an aspect which would be toned down by British officials in later versions. Paragraph 4 was at the heart of Hume&#x27;s declaration. The British Prime Minister was to declare Britain no longer had any ‘selfish, strategic, political or economic interest’ in Ireland. Its sole interest was to promote peace and agreement among the inhabitants of the island. The audience was the Republican movement, as Hume endeavoured to remove the justification given for the armed struggle. Later versions of the Declaration returned, on British insistence, to the original Whitbread formula of &#x27;no selfish strategic or economic interest&#x27; to avoid the implication that the British government was entirely indifferent to the future of Northern Ireland. In Paragraph 5, the Taoiseach reciprocated by affirming that the exercise of the self-determination by the people of Ireland could only be achieved &#x27;with the agreement and consent of the people of Northern Ireland&#x27;. The final paragraph indicated the intention to establish a permanent Irish Peace Convention to enable dialogue about Ireland&#x27;s political future.

=== British-Irish Negotiations ===
The British government was first shown Hume&#x27;s draft in December 1991. In 1992 further versions of the Declaration were drafted by Hume and Adams and shown to both governments, but the initiative began to develop greater momentum in 1993 with Albert Reynolds lending his weight to it, interrupting his holiday to hand over the latest version to Sir Robin Butler on 6 June 1993. Major had vowed at the outset of his premiership to put Northern Ireland &#x27;on the front burner&#x27;, but he was terrified of the fall out of and Unionist reaction if it emerged that he had been involved in drafting a secret agreement, particularly one which had emerged from John Hume&#x27;s talks with Sinn Féin. Initially British officials would not then negotiate a joint text, although they did provide some comments. As time went on, however, the responsibility for drafting was devolved to Seán Ó hUiginn and Quentin Thomas. While the British officially refrained from drafting, they were happy to supply &#x27;texts and references&#x27;. During September to November, the text took shape and incorporated amendments from Jim Molyneaux, Archbishop Eames, and Reverend Roy Magee, designed to make the text more palatable to the Unionist population, including the list of rights which would feature in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.

With the text poised and agreement apparently close in late November 1993, the whole initiative was nearly derailed when Robin Butler and David Blatherwick handed Albert Reynolds an alternative British draft on 26 November 1993, on the basis that they feared the current text would be unacceptable to a Unionist audience. Reynolds was furious, feeling that years of work and painstaking negotiation over precise phrases had been undermined. The fallout of this incident overshadowed the Anglo-Irish summit of 3 December, but neither leader wanted to walk away from the initiative, and committed themselves &#x27;to continue working urgently for a successful outcome&#x27;. The task of refining the text was delegated once more to Seán Ó hUiginn and Quentin Thomas, with final amendments made on 14 December 1993. The text was broadcast from a live press conference in Downing Street on 15 December 1993 and widely distributed in Northern Ireland with an accompanying note from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the following day.

<doc id="633211" wikidata="Q2760628" url="?curid=633211" title="Shaiva Siddhanta">
<text>Shaiva Siddhanta () is a form of Shaivism popular in a pristine form in South India and Sri Lanka and in a Tantrayana syncretised form in Indonesia (as Siwa Siddhanta) propounds a devotional philosophy with the ultimate goal of experiencing union with Shiva. The former draws primarily on the Tamil devotional hymns written by Shaiva saints from the 5th to the 9th century CE, known in their collected form as &quot;Tirumurai&quot;. Tirumular is considered to be the propounder of the term Siddhanta and its basic tenets. In the 12th century, Aghorasiva, the head of a branch monastery of the Amardaka order in Chidambaram, took up the task of formulating Shaiva Siddhanta. This is an earliest known Aghora Paddhati system of Shaiva Siddhanta of Adi Shaivas &quot;matha&quot;s in Kongu Nadu. Meykandar (13th century) was the first systematic philosopher of the school.

The normative rites, cosmology and theology of Shaiva Siddhanta draw upon a combination of Agamas and Vedic scriptures. In the Sri Lankan Sinhalese society, king Rajasinha I of Sitawaka converted to Saiva Siddhantism, and made it the official religion during his reign, after a prolonged domination of Theravada Buddhism following the conversion of king Devanampiya Tissa. This Sinhalese Saiva Siddhanta led to the decline of Buddhism for the next two centuries until being revived by South East Asian orders aided by Europeans, but left vestiges in the Sinhalese society. In the continental south East Asian Ramayanas, Phra Isuan (from Tamilised Sanskrit Isuwaran) is considered the highest of gods, while Theravada Buddhism is the dominant philosophical religion. Here Shaiva Siddhanta is the practical religion while Theravada Buddhism is the philosophical overarch. In the Nusantaran Siwa Siddhanta, Siwa is syncretised with the Buddha in a Tantrayanic form called Siwa-Buda. A similar form is observed in the Chams of Vietnam where the community has diverged into the Shaiva Siddhantic Balamons and the tantrayanic acharyas (Cham: Acars) becoming the Bani Cham Muslims. This is due to the fact that the Indian Bhakti era philosophical and the subsequent royal Shaiva Siddhanta reaction against Buddhism failed to reach south east asia in which Theravada Buddhism, Tantrayana Buddhism and later Islam filled the role of philosophical Shaiva Siddhanta.

This tradition is thought to have been once practiced all over Greater India, but the Muslim subjugation of North India restricted Shaiva Siddhanta to the south where it was preserved with the Tamil Shaiva movement expressed in the &quot;bhakti&quot; poetry of the Nayanars. It is in this historical context that Shaiva Siddhanta is commonly considered a &quot;southern&quot; tradition, one that is still very much alive. The Tamil compendium of devotional songs known as &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, the Shaiva Agamas and &quot;Meykanda&quot; or &quot;Siddhanta&quot; Shastras, form the scriptural canon of Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta.

==Etymology==

Monier-Williams gives the meaning of &quot;siddhanta&quot; as &#x27;any fixed or established or canonical text-book or received scientific treatise on any subject ... as .. Brahma-siddhanta ब्रह्म-सिद्धान्त... Surya-siddhanta, etc. 

Karen Pechilis defines the term Shaiva Siddhanta as &quot;the end of the knowledge of Shiva&quot; signifying its culmination. Similar to Vedanta, which is the culmination of the Vedas, Shaiva Siddhanta makes a claim to be the authoritative interpretation of the knowledge of Shiva.

==History==

Shaiva Siddhanta&#x27;s original form is uncertain. Some hold that it originated as a monistic doctrine, espoused by Kashmiri northern shaivites (date unknown). South India is another theorized location of origin, where it was most prevalent. It seems likely to others, however, that the early Śaiva Siddhānta may have developed somewhere in India, as a religion built around the notion of a ritual initiation that conferred liberation. Such a notion of liberatory initiation appears to have been borrowed from a Pashupata (&quot;pāśupata&quot;) tradition. At the time of the early development of the theology of the school, the question of monism or dualism, which became so central to later theological debates, had not yet emerged as an important issue.

=== Ontological Categories ===
Shaiva Siddhanta believes in three different categories, which are distinct from each other:

# &quot;pati&quot; (&quot;Lord&quot;), is Siva himself and cause of emission, maintenance, re-absorption, concealment and grace.
# &quot;pasu&quot; (&quot;Soul&quot;), is individual Soul, distinct from Siva, but bound because of impurities.
# &quot;pasa&quot; (&quot;Bond&quot;), the three impurities - &quot;anava&quot; (ego), &quot;karma&quot; (deed) and &quot;maya&quot; (delusion).
The soul gains experience through its action (rituals), which removes the three impurities, but the liberation is realized only by the grace of Lord Siva.

=== Four stages ===
According to Shaiva Siddhanta texts, there are four progressive stages of &quot;Siva bhaki&quot; for a path to attain &quot;moksha&quot;:

# &quot;dāsamārga&quot;, offering service to devotees of Siva in different ways such as cleaning temple, weaving flower garlands for the image of Siva, praising Lord Siva.
# &quot;satputramārga&quot;, a true son&#x27;s way, offering personal devotion by preparing &quot;pūjā&quot; and performing meditation. 
# sahamārga, offering devotion by practicing yoga.
# &quot;sanmārga&quot;, the way of truth and reality and the highest way, offering devotion by knowledge of God, experiencing the bliss of liberation and becoming one with God.

===Tamil bhakti===

From the 5th to the 8th century CE Buddhism and Jainism had spread in Tamil Nadu before a forceful Shaiva bhakti movement arose. Between the 7th and 9th centuries, pilgrim saints such as Sambandar, Appar, Sundarar 63 nayanmars used songs of Shiva&#x27;s greatness to refute concepts of Buddhism and Jainism. Manikkavacakar&#x27;s verses, called &quot;Tiruvacakam&quot;, are full of visionary experience, divine love and urgent striving for truth. The songs of these four saints are part of the compendium known as &quot;Tirumurai&quot; which, along with the Vedas, Shaiva Agamas, and the Meykanda Shastras, are now considered to form the scriptural basis of the Śaiva Siddhānta in Tamil Nadu. It seems probable that the Tirumurai devotional literature was not, however, considered to belong to the Śaiva Siddhānta canon at the time when it was first composed: the hymns themselves appear to make no such claim for themselves.

The Bhakti movement should not be exaggerated as an articulation of a &#x27;class struggle&#x27;; there is nevertheless a strong sense against rigid structures in the society.

Tamil exclusivist reform Saiva Siddhanta:

The exclusive Tamil reformist Saiva Siddhanta are people living in a community faced with strong nationalist ideas. In that way their beliefs in a religious way and their beliefs in a political way were mostly intertwined. Maraimalai Adigal and his religious belief in the Saiva Siddhanta, for example, were heavily influenced by the Tamil Nationalism and especially by the party of the Shivaistic Revivalist, which he and his mentor had a part in creating. In Adigals belief system you can see how the Saiva Siddhanta that he relies his core beliefs on is mixed with his and the Revivalists core political to a very an individual tamilic Saiva Siddhanta Tradition. For example, though the Saiva Siddhanta in itself is not anti-Brahmanic Adigal develop it into having that tendency. That way his religious teaching in the Saiva Siddhanta strengthens his pro-Tamil and pro-shivaism attitude. It helps him and the Revivalists to establish their idea of the &quot;pure Tamil&quot;, by becoming a religious tradition not reliant on any ties to older traditions by becoming itself the oldest tradition.

===Denominations===
Adi Shaiva Siddhanta:

In the 12th century, Aghorasiva, the head of a branch monastery of the Amardaka order in Chidambaram, took up the task of formulating Shaiva Siddhanta. Strongly refuting monist interpretations of Siddhanta, Aghorasiva brought a change in the understanding of Siva by reclassifying the first five principles, or tattvas (Nada, Bindu, Sadasiva, Isvara and Suddhavidya), into the category of pasa (bonds), stating they were effects of a cause and inherently unconscious substances, a departure from the traditional teaching in which these five were part of the divine nature of God.

Aghorasiva was successful in preserving the rituals of the ancient Āgamic tradition. To this day, Aghorasiva&#x27;s Siddhanta philosophy is followed by almost all of the hereditary temple priests (Sivacharya), and his texts on the Āgamas have become the standard puja manuals. His &quot;Kriyakramadyotika&quot; is a vast work covering nearly all aspects of Shaiva Siddhanta ritual, including the daily worship of Siva, occasional rituals, initiation rites, funerary rites, and festivals. This Aghora Paddhati of Shaiva Siddhanta is followed by the ancient gruhasta Adi Shaiva Maths of Kongu Nadu and the temple Sthanika Sivacharya priests of south India.

In Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta, the 13th century Meykandar, Arulnandi Sivacharya, and Umapati Sivacharya further spread Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta. Meykandar&#x27;s twelve-verse Śivajñānabodham and subsequent works by other writers, all supposedly of the 13th and 14th centuries, laid the foundation of the Meykandar Sampradaya (lineage), which propounds a pluralistic realism wherein God, souls and world are coexistent and without beginning. Siva is an efficient but not material cause. They view the soul&#x27;s merging in Siva as salt in water, an eternal oneness that is also twoness. This later Sampradaya is followed by the 18 cardinal non Adi Shaiva sanyasi Adheenam Maths in Chola, Pandya, Nadu and Tondai Nadus.

Khmer Shaiva Siddhanta (extinct):

In the Angkorian Khmer empire, Shaiva Siddhanta flourished until the royal patronage of Theravada Buddhism and the subsequent fall of the empire&#x27;s God-king Siddhantic hierarchy. 

Cham Shaiva Siddhanta:

In Cham society, the Shaiva Siddhanta - Tantrayana divide resulted in the divergence of the society into the Shaivites becoming Balamon Hindus and tantrayanists converting into the Bani Cham Muslims.

Nusantaran Siwa Siddhanta:

In Majapahit nusantara, Siwa Siddhanta syncretised into the Tantrayana Siwa-Buda portrayed by Nagarakretagama. It still survives in the Agama Hindu Dharma. This synthesis is portrayed by the Kakawin Sutasoma derived national motto of Indonesia: &#x27;Bhinneka Tunggal Ika&#x27;.

Sinhalese Shaiva Siddhanta (extinct):

In the Sri Lankan Sinhalese society, king Rajasinha I of Sitawaka reverted to Saiva Siddhantism after a prolonged domination of Theravada Buddhism following the conversion of king Devanampiya Tissa.

King Rajasinha arranged the marriage of his Tamil minister Mannamperuma Mohottala to a sister of a junior queen known as the &quot;iron daughter&quot; He converted to Shaiva Siddhanta He was reported to have settled Brahmans Adi Shaivas and Tamil Shaivite Velalars at significant Buddhist sites such as Sri Pada, etc. The &quot;Velala Gurukkals&quot; acted as religious mentors of the King and strengthened &quot;Shaiva Siddhantism&quot; at these centres. Under the advice of Mannamperuma Mohottala, he razed many Buddhist religious sites to the ground. Buddhism remained in decline thereafter until the formation of the Siam Nikaya and Amarapura Nikaya with the support of the Portuguese and Dutch East India Company respectively.

Traces of the era exist in temples like Barandi Kovila (Bhairava-andi kovil) in Sitawaka and the worship of other Shaivite deities by the Sinhalese, like the syncretic Natha deviyo, Sella kataragama and others.

Tamil exclusivist Saiva Siddhanta:

This colonial new age movement was initiated by the Tamil purist nationalist Maraimalai Adigal. This school is followed by modern Maths dating from the colonial age likes of the Perur Adheenam (Circa 1895 initiate of the then Arasu Palli caste headed Mayilam Bommapuram Lingayat Adheenam) of Coimbatore which holds Lingayatism as the &#x27;primeval&#x27; form of Shaiva Siddhantism . This modern sampradaya aims to &#x27;rid&#x27; Shaiva Siddhantism of the two former earlier traditions which follow the Vedic and Agamic texts and Adi Shaivas thereby &#x27;purifying&#x27; Saiva Siddhanta with the Dravidian movement related Tamil Nationalist undertones.

Modern Shaiva Siddhanta:

Post colonial and contemporary movements like that of Bodhinatha Veylanswami&#x27;s Shaiva Siddhanta Church have stressed upon reforming orthodox Shaiva Siddhanta of the pre-colonial era by initiating the non Shaivite born, both Indians and westerners. This movement also rejects animal sacrifices mentioned in the Siddhantic Vedic and Agamic scriptures.

===Saiva Siddhanta today===
Saiva Siddhanta is practiced widely among the Saivas of southern India and Sri Lanka, especially by members of the Adi Shaivas, Kongu Vellalar, Vellalar and Nagarathar communities of South India. It has over 5 million followers in Tamil Nadu, and is also prevalent among the Tamil diaspora around the world. It has thousands of active temples predominantly in Tamil Nadu and also in places around the world with significant Tamil population and also has numerous monastic and ascetic traditions, along with its own community of priests, the &quot;Adishaivas,&quot; who are qualified to perform Agama-based Shaiva Temple rituals.

The Encyclopedia of Saiva Religion, a ten-volume Saivite publication released in 2013, documents 990 Saivite institutions of Saiva Siddhanta. While many emerged after the 19th century, traditional centers like Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam, Dharmapuram Adheenam, and Thiruppanandal Kasi Math, founded in the 16th and 17th centuries, remain influencial.

Kumaragurupara Desikar, a Tamil Saivite poet says that Shaiva Siddhantha is the ripe fruit of the Vedanta tree. G.U. Pope, an Anglican Tamil Scholar, mentions that Shaiva Sidhantha is the best expression of Tamil knowledge.

==Theology==
===Texts===
The texts revered by the southern Saiva Siddhanta are the Vedas; the twenty-eight Saiva Agamas; Shaiva Puranas; the two Itihasas which form the ritual basis of the tradition; the twelve books of the Tamil Saiva canon called the Tirumurai, which contains the poetry of the Nayanars; the Aghora Paddhati, a codified form of all the above and additionally the Saiva Siddhanta Shastras for the Meykandar denomination.

A widely quoted and often given classical status, anonymous verse in Tamil Saiva Siddhanta expresses the relationship between the Vedas, Agamas, and Tamil literature:

===Early theology===
Siddhas such as Sadyojyoti (c. 7th century) are credited with the systematization of the Siddhanta theology in Sanskrit. Sadyojyoti, initiated by the guru Ugrajyoti, propounded the Siddhanta philosophical views as found in the &quot;Rauravatantra&quot; and &quot;Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṅgraha.&quot; He may or may not have been from Kashmir, but the next thinkers whose works survive were those of a Kashmirian lineage active in the 10th century: Rāmakaṇṭha I, Vidyākaṇṭha I, Śrīkaṇṭha, Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha, Rāmakaṇṭha II, Vidyākaṇṭha II. Treatises by the last four of these survive. King Bhoja of Gujarat (c. 1018) condensed the massive body of Siddhanta scriptural texts into one concise metaphysical treatise called the &quot;Tattvaprakāśa&quot;.

===Later theology===
The culmination of a long period of systematisation of its theology appears to have taken place in Kashmir in the 10th century, the exegetical works of the Kashmirian authors Bhatta Narayanakantha and Bhatta Ramakantha being the most sophisticated expressions of this school of thought. Their works were quoted and emulated in the works of 12th-century South Indian authors, such as Aghorasiva and Trilocanasiva. The theology they expound is based on a canon of Tantric scriptures called Siddhantatantras or Shaiva Agamas. This canon is traditionally held to contain twenty-eight scriptures, but the lists vary, and several doctrinally significant scriptures, such as the &quot;Mrgendra&quot;, are not listed. In the systematisation of the ritual of the Shaiva Siddhanta, the Kashmirian thinkers appear to have exercised less influence: the treatise that had the greatest impact on Shaiva ritual, and indeed on ritual outside the Shaiva sectarian domain, for we find traces of it in such works as the Agnipurana, is a ritual manual composed in North India in the late 11th century by a certain Somasambhu.

==Monastic orders==
Three monastic orders were instrumental in Shaiva Siddhanta&#x27;s diffusion through India; the Amardaka order, identified with one of Shaivism&#x27;s holiest cities, Ujjain, the Mattamayura order, in the capital of the Chalukya dynasty, and the Madhumateya order of Central India. Each developed numerous sub-orders. Siddhanta monastics used the influence of royal patrons to propagate the teachings in neighboring kingdoms, particularly in South India. From Mattamayura, they established monasteries in regions now in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra and Kerala.

In today&#x27;s Tamil Nadu, there are both the ancient grhasta Amardaka lineage Aghora Paddhati Adi Shaiva Maths and the sanyasi non Adi Shaiva Meykandar Sampradaya Adheenams (monastic) today. Adi Shaiva Maths numbering around 40 are usually centred in Kongu Nadu and the 18 Adheenams in Tondai Nadu, Chola Nadu and Pandya Nadu.

In the Sinhalese areas of Sri Lanka, the &quot;Tamil Velala Gurukkal&quot; either returned back or merged with the priestly &quot;Kapurala&quot; caste but retaining their Tamil surnames with a few persisting in places like the SellaKataragama temple. In Indonesia, Siwa Siddhanta syncretised with Tantrayana survives as Agama Hindu Dharma. In Indo-China, Shaiva Siddhanta survives as an uninstitutionalised worship of Shiva as an ancestral God of gods: Phra Isuan (Tamil: Isuwaran), while in Vietnamese Cham, it flourishes within the Balamon section.

<text>K. H. Ting, Ting Kuang-hsun or Ding Guangxun (; 20 September 1915 – 22 November 2012), was Chairperson emeritus of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and President emeritus of the China Christian Council, the government-approved Protestant church in China.

Ting was trained in the Anglican tradition and, in 1955, was consecrated as Anglican Bishop of Chekiang. As he never renounced his ordination, he remained a bishop until his death. However, in 1958 the Anglican Church in China came to an end as an independent institution in mainland China, leaving Ting with no episcopal functions to perform.

Ting had also held a number of political posts. He was a vice-chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (1989–2008), and a member of the National People&#x27;s Congress, China&#x27;s legislature.

== Biography ==
Ting was educated at Shanghai&#x27;s Saint John&#x27;s University (1937–42), graduating B.A. in 1937 and B.D. in 1942. In the same year, he was ordained as an Anglican deacon and married Siu-May Kuo (1916–1995), both taken place at the Church of Our Savior on Wu Yuan Road, Shanghai.

From 1942 to 1945, Ting worked in the administration of the YMCA. In 1946, he and his wife moved to Canada, where he became missions secretary of the Canadian Student Christian Movement. Ting studied at Columbia University and at Union Theological Seminary, both in New York City, from 1947 to 1948, gaining a master&#x27;s degree in arts and theology. From 1948 to 1951, he worked in the administration of the World Student Christian Federation in Geneva, Switzerland.

In 1951 the Tings returned to China with their young son Stephen Yenren Ting, born in November 1948. Their second son Heping Ting was born in July 1952. Ting went on to serve as general manager of the Shanghai-based Chinese Christian Literature Society from 1951 to 1953, when he became principal of Nanjing Union Theological Seminary.

In 1954, shortly after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, 138 Chinese Christian leaders presented the Christian Manifesto to the country, pledging the support of Christians for anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and the struggle against bureaucratic capitalism. This manifesto would launch the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, of which Ting was elected to the standing committee in the same year. In 1955, he was consecrated as the Anglican bishop of Zhejiang. By 1957, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement claimed the loyalty of the overwhelming majority of Christians in China.

In 1958, the Anglican Church in China was merged into the Chinese Christian Church and Ting lost his positions in the Anglican Church, but he remained a bishop in the eyes of many Chinese Christians and the wider Anglican Church. He returned to prominence in the 1970s. In 1980, he became President of the China Christian Council and leader of the TSPM, positions he held until 1997. In 1985, Ting helped found the Amity Foundation and remained its president as well as being principal of Nanjing Union Theological Seminary until his death. In 1988, Ting proclaimed that &quot;the church should be in tune with socialism, but should not be a government department&quot;, proposing the end of the Three-Self Movement by 1991. This proposal was rejected after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

Ting died on 22 November 2012, and his body was cremated on 27 November. Yu Zhengsheng attended his funeral on behalf of the central government. Several Chinese Anglican leaders, such as Peter Kwong and Paul Kwong, led Ting&#x27;s funeral service on 8 December at Christianity Mochou Road Church.

==Theology==
Before the 1950s, influenced by his predecessor Y. T. Wu, Ting joined the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA), attempting to devote himself to the national salvation and advocating that Christianity focuses not just individual salvation, but also social salvation. At that time, he also appreciated communism, although cautiously. In 1948 when he commented on the civil war in China, he wrote:
With the fall of Chiang and the Kuomintang government, and after the defeat of contemporary Chinese reactionaries who now rally around Chiang, a democratic coalition government will be formed in which Communists, Democratic Leaguers, progressive Nationalists and members of other anti-reactionary parties will all participate. What Americans think of as a Communist dictatorship is not in the wind for China&#x27;s future.

After he returned the new China in 1951, he joined the Three-self movement which was led by Y. T. Wu and chose to cooperate with the CCP regime. Ting became one of the most influential Christian leaders in the national Three-self Patriotic Movement and the China Christian Council since the 1980s.

=== Theological reconstruction ===
Ting&#x27;s writings were mainly published after the 1980s. Ting formally started to construct his theological discourse aiming to deal with the relation of Christian faith with communism and other religions; meanwhile, he promoted &quot;theological reconstruction&quot; () in an attempt to construct indigenous theology on the basis of Chinese socio-political and religio-cultural context. It was also seen by some as an attempt to remove fundamentalist and evangelical forms of Christianity from the Chinese church.

=== Ecclesiology ===
The TSPM was regarded as the application of the three principles of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. Ting claimed that &quot;it is work of God.&quot; Ting avidly accused Wang Mingdao of distorting the meaning of three principles and refusing to cooperate with TSPM. Besides, he believed that the church should play an active role in the society for serving the people, rather than cling to the church just paying attention to individual salvation.

=== Christology ===
Ting summarizes that a Cosmic Christ encompasses two aspects:

(1) the universal extent of Christ&#x27;s domain, concern and care, and (2) the kind of love which we get a taste of in Jesus Christ as we read the Gospels being the first and supreme attribute of God and the basic to the structure and dynamic of the universe, in the light of which we get an insight as to how things go in the world.

Influenced greatly by the thinking of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and process theology based on the writings of Alfred North Whitehead, Ting argues that creation is a long process in which Christ not just participated in creation in the beginning, but continues to sustain the incomplete creation. Redemption is in the process of creation. Following this, he contends that not Christians but humankind are involved in Christ&#x27;s redemptive work. In this way, he appeals to Christians to appreciate the values in communism and other religio-cultural resources.

=== The sinned against ===
With regards to the doctrine of sin, Ting has pushed away from the traditional emphasis on people as &quot;sinners&quot; but also as individuals who are &quot;sinned against.&quot; Ting is opposed to creating &quot;antagonism between believers and nonbelievers&quot; by aggressive proselytization, favoring brotherly love towards and not condemnations to hell of Chinese non-Christians. Because China is a Confucian society where the theory of the goodness of human nature is the mainstream. The emphasis of &quot;The sinned against&quot; leads people to know the love of God and receive consolation after a long-time oppression and suffering in the history.

=== Justification by faith ===
Ting has argued that the doctrine of justification by faith has been misunderstood by many Christians and that it was originally meant to liberate humans rather than consign people to hell. Because of this, he has been accused of replacing the traditional Protestant doctrine with justification by &quot;love&quot;, to support the notion that those who God&#x27;s love are within the boundaries of Christianity; it is therefore considered to be an attempt to reconcile the atheistic ideology of communism with Christianity in order to maintain good relations with the People’s Republic of China. However, he has explicitly stated that he neither understands what the phrase means but considers it a misleading imitation of justification by faith.

=== Relation between Christians and atheists ===
Ting considered that Christians should get along well with non-Christians and atheists of all sorts. Besides, he further stresses that &quot;Provisional unities of truths we can observe with joy and thanksgiving because they illuminate us and point toward the ultimate unity in Christ which is the promise of his revelation.&quot;

<text>The 72nd Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored films released in 1999 and took place on March 26, 2000, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, beginning at 5:30 p.m. PST / 8:30 p.m. EST. During the ceremony, the AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by husband-and-wife producing team Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck and was directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Billy Crystal hosted the show for the seventh time. He first presided over the 62nd ceremony held in 1990 and had last hosted the 70th ceremony held in 1998. Three weeks earlier in a ceremony at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California held on March 4, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Salma Hayek.

&quot;American Beauty&quot; won five awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included &quot;The Matrix&quot; with four awards, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; and &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; with two, and &quot;All About My Mother&quot;, &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, &quot;King Gimp&quot;, &quot;My Mother Dreams the Satan&#x27;s Disciples in New York&quot;, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, &quot;One Day in September&quot;, &quot;The Red Violin&quot;, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, and &quot;Tarzan&quot; with one. The telecast garnered almost 47 million viewers in the United States.

==Winners and nominees==
The nominees for the 72nd Academy Awards were announced on February 15, 2000, at 5:38 a.m. PST (13:38 UTC) at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Robert Rehme, president of the academy, and the actor Dustin Hoffman. &quot;American Beauty&quot; received the most nominations with eight total; &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; and &quot;The Insider&quot; tied for second with seven nominations each.

The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 26, 2000. Sam Mendes was the sixth person to win Best Director for his directorial debut. Best Actor winner Kevin Spacey became the tenth performer to win acting Oscars in both lead and supporting categories. By virtue of her father Jon Voight&#x27;s Best Lead Actor win for 1978&#x27;s &quot;Coming Home&quot;, Best Supporting Actress winner Angelina Jolie and Voight became the second father-daughter Oscar acting winners. At the age of 11, Haley Joel Osment became the second-youngest actor to receive a nomination in Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, after Justin Henry was nominated in the same category for 1979&#x27;s &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; at the age of 8.

==Ceremony information==

In view of the new millennium, the academy sought to both shorten the telecast and give the ceremony a new look. Husbandandwife producers Richard D. Zanuck and Lili Fini Zanuck were recruited to oversee the production of the 2000 ceremony. AMPAS President Robert Rehme explained the decision to hire the Zanucks saying, &quot;With this new producing team in place, I look forward to a whole new perspective.&quot; This marked the first occurrence that a woman was tapped for producing duties at the Oscars. Despite Richard and Lili&#x27;s promises to make changes to the ceremony, they hired actor and veteran Oscar host Billy Crystal to host the ceremony for the seventh time.

Production of the ceremony was reported to be far more ambitious and extravagant than previous ceremonies. Art director Bob Keene designed an ambitiously technological stage design for the telecast that used a floor adorned with flashing lights and several 35 foot columns consisting of high-definition video monitors stacked atop each other. The columns were used to display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage, nomination packages, and reaction shots of the acting nominees as the winner was being announced. Because of serious technical challenges concerning movement, lighting, and overheating, Keene and his production design team tested the stage at ABC Prospect Studios before installing it at the Shrine Auditorium.

Several other people were involved in the production of the ceremony. Actor Peter Coyote, who served as announcer for the telecast, was often seen before commercial breaks live behind the stage. Musical directors Burt Bacharach, Don Was, and Rob Shrock composed a techno-pop soundtrack that substituted for a live orchestra during most of the ceremony. In addition, Bacharach rounded up musicians that included Garth Brooks, Queen Latifah, and Dionne Warwick to perform a medley of songs previously nominated for Best Original Song. Choreographer Kenny Ortega supervised the &quot;Blame Canada&quot; musical number.

===Box office performance of nominees===
At the time of the nominations announcement on February 15, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees was $521 million with an average of $104 million per film. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $278.4 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by &quot;The Green Mile&quot; ($120.7 million), &quot;American Beauty&quot; ($74.7 million), &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; ($20.7 million), and finally &quot;The Insider&quot; ($26.6 million).

Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 37 nominations went to 11 films on the list. Only &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (2nd), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (13th), &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (26th), and &quot;American Beauty&quot; (27th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned the nominations were &quot;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; (1st), &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (3rd), &quot;The Matrix&quot; (5th), &quot;Tarzan&quot; (6th), &quot;The Mummy&quot; (8th), &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (11th), and &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (20th).

===Missing paper ballots===
Nearly two weeks before Oscar voting was finished, AMPAS reported that 4,000 of the ballots mailed to Academy members were missing. The bags that carried the ballots were mislabeled as third-class mail. On March 6, 2000, 1,000 of the ballots were discovered at a US Postal Service regional distribution center in Bell, California. In response to affected members, AMPAS sent replacement ballots sealed in yellow envelopes, and extended the voting deadline by two days to March 23.

===Oscar statuettes theft===
On March 10, 2000, 55 Oscar statuettes were stolen from a Roadway Express loading dock in Bell, California. In the event the stolen awards were to be still missing during the festivities, AMPAS announced that R.S. Owens &amp; Company, the manufacturer of the awards would produce a new batch of the golden statuettes. Nine days later, 52 of the stolen statuettes were discovered in a trash bin at a Food 4 Less supermarket located in the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles by a man named Willie Fulgear. For the safe recovery of the stolen statuettes, Roadway Express rewarded Fulgear with $50,000, and the academy invited him and his son Allen to the ceremony. Two Roadway Express employees, truck driver Lawrence Ledent and dock worker Anthony Hart, were arrested for the theft of the Oscars. Both men pleaded no contest. Lawrence served six months in prison and Anthony received probation. A third man who was Mr. Fulgear&#x27;s half-brother was initially charged with the crime, but police dropped those charges after Mr. Fulgear divulged that they were estranged from each other. Three years later, one of three remaining missing Oscar statuettes was discovered during a drug bust at a mansion in Miami, Florida; the other two have yet to be found.

===Critical reviews===
The show received a positive reception from most media publications. Television critic Monica Collins of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; praised producers Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck for overseeing a show that was &quot;clean, snappy, high-gloss and very well produced.&quot; She also quipped that host Billy Crystal did not need to save the show this time because &quot;everything seemed to come together. &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; Wesley Morris wrote &quot;the show was downright hip, more so than it&#x27;s been in decades.&quot; He also gave high marks for the &quot;techno-chic&quot; production elements from the music and stage design. Columnist Paul Brownfield of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; raved that &quot;the 72nd annual Academy Awards telecast was hipper than in years past, sleeker in look and edgier in tone.&quot; He added that Crystal was &quot;the perfect antidote to the entire evening&#x27;s self-serious posturing.&quot;

Some media outlets were more critical of the show. John Carman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; lamented that despite being solid and tidy, &quot;the show never quite managed the big surprises, sloppy excesses and emotional highs we hope to see.&quot; &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; television critic Rob Owen criticized the uneven pacing of the ceremony writing that the telecast &quot;started slowly – 20 minutes of Billy Crystal&#x27;s spoofs and singing that weren&#x27;t as funny as his past Oscar intros – and never got up to speed.&quot; Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that &quot;the four-hour show turned into a zombie.&quot; She also stated that the telecast was bloated with too many tributes to Hollywood&#x27;s past.

===Ratings and reception===
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 46.52 million viewers over its length, which was a 3% increase from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony. An estimated 79.11 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 29.64% of households watching over a 48.32 share. It also drew a higher 1849 demo rating with a 19.86 rating over a 39.34 share among viewers in that demographic.

In July 2000, the show received nine nominations at the 52nd Primetime Emmy Awards. Two months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Louis J. Horvitz&#x27;s direction of the telecast.

<text>In supergravity theories combining general relativity and supersymmetry, the gravitino () is the gauge fermion supersymmetric partner of the hypothesized graviton. It has been suggested as a candidate for dark matter.

If it exists, it is a fermion of spin and therefore obeys the Rarita–Schwinger equation. The gravitino field is conventionally written as &quot;ψμα&quot; with a four-vector index and a spinor index.
For one would get negative norm modes, as with every massless particle of spin 1 or higher. These modes are unphysical, and for consistency there must be a gauge symmetry which cancels these modes: , where &quot;εα&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a spinor function of spacetime. This gauge symmetry is a local supersymmetry transformation, and the resulting theory is supergravity.

Thus the gravitino is the fermion mediating supergravity interactions, just as the photon is mediating electromagnetism, and the graviton is presumably mediating gravitation. Whenever supersymmetry is broken in supergravity theories, it acquires a mass which is determined by the scale at which supersymmetry is broken. This varies greatly between different models of supersymmetry breaking, but if supersymmetry is to solve the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model, the gravitino cannot be more massive than about 1 TeV/c2.

== History ==

Murray Gell-Mann and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen intended the spin-3/2 particle associated with supergravity to be called the &#x27;hemitrion&#x27;, meaning &#x27;half-3&#x27;, however the editors of &quot;Physical Review&quot; were not keen on the name and instead suggested &#x27;massless Rarita–Schwinger particle&#x27; for their 1977 publication. The current name of gravitino was instead suggested by Sidney Coleman and Heinz Pagels, although this term was originally coined in 1954 by Felix Pirani to describe a class of negative energy excitations with zero rest mass.

==Gravitino cosmological problem==
If the gravitino indeed has a mass of the order of TeV, then it creates a problem in the standard model of cosmology, at least naïvely.

One option is that the gravitino is stable. This would be the case if the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle and R-parity is conserved (or nearly so). In this case the gravitino is a candidate for dark matter; as such gravitinos will have been created in the very early universe. However, one may calculate the density of gravitinos and it turns out to be much higher than the observed dark matter density.

The other option is that the gravitino is unstable. Thus the gravitinos mentioned above would decay and will not contribute to the observed dark matter density. However, since they decay only through gravitational interactions, their lifetime would be very long, of the order of in natural units, where &quot;Mpl&quot; is the Planck mass and &quot;m&quot; is the mass of a gravitino. For a gravitino mass of the order of TeV this would be , much later than the era of nucleosynthesis. At least one possible channel of decay must include either a photon, a charged lepton or a meson, each of which would be energetic enough to destroy a nucleus if it strikes one. One can show that enough such energetic particles will be created in the decay as to destroy almost all the nuclei created in the era of nucleosynthesis, in contrast with observations. In fact, in such a case the universe would have been made of hydrogen alone, and star formation would probably be impossible.

One possible solution to the cosmological gravitino problem is the split supersymmetry model, where the gravitino mass is much higher than the TeV scale, but other fermionic supersymmetric partners of standard model particles already appear at this scale.

Another solution is that R-parity is slightly violated and the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle. This causes almost all supersymmetric particles in the early Universe to decay into Standard Model particles via R-parity violating interactions well before the synthesis of primordial nuclei; a small fraction however decay into gravitinos, whose half-life is orders of magnitude greater than the age of the Universe due to the suppression of the decay rate by the Planck scale and the small R-parity violating couplings.

<text>The Chicago School of literary criticism was a form of criticism of English literature begun at the University of Chicago in the 1930s, which lasted until the 1950s. It was also called Neo-Aristotelianism, due to its strong emphasis on Aristotle&#x27;s concepts of plot, character and genre. It was partly a reaction to New Criticism, a then highly popular form of literary criticism, which the Chicago critics accused of being too subjective and placing too much importance on irony and figurative language. They aimed instead for total objectivity and a strong classical basis of evidence for criticism. The New Critics regarded the language and poetic diction as most important, but the Chicago School considered such things merely the building material of poetry. Like Aristotle, they valued the structure or form of a literary work as a whole, rather than the complexities of the language. Despite this, the Chicago School is considered by some to be a part of the New Criticism movement.

==Beginnings==
Ronald Salmon Crane (1886–1967) is considered the founder of the Chicago Aristotelians. He began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1924, was made a professor in 1925, and chaired the English department there from 1935–1947. In 1935, he wrote “History versus Criticism in the Study of Literature” (published in &quot;English Journal&quot; 24 [1935]:645-67), in which he defined literary criticism as “simply the disciplined consideration, at once analytical and evaluative, of literary works as works of art.” Crane was greatly influenced by Richard McKeon, a professor of philosophy at the University, who stressed Aristotle&#x27;s idea of &quot;pluralism,&quot; which says that many systems of criticism are necessary to completely understand literature, specifically poetry, or in the case of philosophy, the world. Crane said that “the only rational ground for adhering to one [form of criticism] rather than to any of the others is its superior capacity to give us the special kind of understanding and evaluation of literature we want to get, at least for the time being.”

==Theory==
The question for the Chicago School (as it was for Aristotle) was always what the purpose of the theory of criticism was, what hypotheses were brought to bear by the theory about the nature of literature (for instance, whether it consisted of the words alone, or whether it was to be thought of as part of a larger context such as an era or an artist&#x27;s life), and the definitions of words (such as the definition of tragedy or comedy).

The Chicago School claimed not to preclude other theories of criticism. It did, however, criticize those who were not clear or consistent about the initial hypotheses and definitions behind their theories. It thus appeared to many of the proponents of those theories that the Chicago School was claiming that theirs was the only good and effective approach to literature. For this reason, they were considered by some critics (including W.K. Wimsatt, whose essay &quot;The Chicago Critics&quot; is a critical assessment of their work) to be hypocritical, although they would vehemently deny this.

==Purpose==
Many of the ideas of the Chicago School are thought to have come out of the reorganization of undergraduate education at the University of Chicago by Robert Maynard Hutchins, then President there. He placed great importance on primary sources and interdisciplinary studies for all students. Crane and his colleagues were forced to defend English as a valid topic of study, and the Chicago School might have developed partly from this pressure to put the study of English on a sound classical basis.

Other key figures in the Chicago School were Norman Maclean, Elder Olson, William Rea Keast and Bernard Weinberg. After this first generation, the most important critics to carry on the theory were Wayne C. Booth (who taught at the University of Chicago from 1947-1950 and again from 1962 until his death in 2005) and his contemporaries, Richard L. Levin, Sheldon Sacks, Robert Marsh, Arthur Heiserman, Ralph W. Rader, and Mortimer J. Adler. Booth loosened the rigid categories of genre originally set forth by the Chicago School and moved the concentration away from poetry towards rhetoric. The Chicago School has demonstrated continuing importance, and continuing flexibility, in the work of the third-generation Chicago critics, including Michael Boardman, Barbara Foley, Walter A. Davis, Dorothy Hale, Elizabeth Langland, James Phelan, Peter J. Rabinowitz, David H. Richter, and Harry Shaw, among others.

==Works==
Notable works in the Chicago School include &quot;Critics and Criticism&quot; (Crane, ed. Chicago, 1952), &quot;The Languages of Criticism and the Structure of Poetry&quot; (Crane, Toronto, 1953), and &quot;The Rhetoric of Fiction&quot; (Booth. Chicago, 1983).

<text>Cynthia Ann Birdsong (born December 15, 1939) is an American singer who became famous as a member of The Supremes in 1967, when she replaced co-founding member Florence Ballard. Birdsong had previously been a member of Patti LaBelle &amp; The Bluebelles.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Birdsong was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey on December 15, 1939, to parents Lloyd Green Birdsong Sr. and Annie Birdsong, as the eldest of their children. After living in Philadelphia for a duration of her childhood, the family returned to New Jersey, settling in Camden. Birdsong set her sights on becoming a nurse and attending college in Pennsylvania. When Cindy returned to Philadelphia she was contacted by a longtime friend, Patsy Holte, in 1960 to replace Sundray Tucker in Holt&#x27;s singing group The Ordettes. At twenty years of age, Birdsong was the oldest member of the group with the remainder of the group still in their mid-teens.

===Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles===
By 1962, the group had two new members, Sarah Dash, and Nona Hendryx, both who previously sung for a vocal group which was defunct at the time. In the same year, they auditioned for local record label owner Harold Robinson. Robinson agreed to work with the group after hearing LaBelle sing the song &quot;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman&quot;.

Shortly after Robinson signed them, he had them record as the Blue Belles and they were selected to promote the recording of &quot;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman&quot;, which had been recorded by the Starlets. It was recorded as a Bluebelles single due to label conflict. The Starlets&#x27; manager sued Harold Robinson after the Blue Belles were seen performing a lip-synching version of the song on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. After settling out of court, Robinson altered the group&#x27;s name to &quot;Patti LaBelle and The Blue Belles&quot;. Initially, a Billboard ad cited the group as &quot;Patti Bell and the Blue Bells&quot;. In 1963, the group scored their first hit single with the ballad &quot;Down the Aisle&quot;. Later in the year, they recorded their rendition of the &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;; the single was later re-released on Cameo-Parkway Records where the group scored a second hit on the pop charts with the song in 1964. Another charted single, &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, was released that same year. In 1965, after Cameo-Parkway folded, the group signed with Atlantic Records where they recorded twelve singles for the label, including the mildly charted singles &quot;All or Nothing&quot; and &quot;Take Me for a Little While&quot;. The group&#x27;s Atlantic tenure included their rendition of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and a version of the song &quot;Groovy Kind of Love&quot;.

===Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes (1967–1970)===

By this time, Birdsong was contacted by Berry Gordy in April 1967. She was being considered as a replacement for Florence Ballard by Diana Ross due to Ballard&#x27;s &quot;erratic behavior&quot;. Birdsong said: All I was told was they wanted me there. I was met at the airport by Motown executives and driven to Berry Gordy&#x27;s house where the group was having a meeting with him. I was a still a member of Patti&#x27;s group and didn&#x27;t even tell her that I was going to Detroit. So, the door of the room swung open and Florence came out in tears. Her mother came out with her. Oh, she was so upset, so shaken, she didn&#x27;t even see me. it was then I realized that I was to replace her. I felt so bad, but later on Florence understood why I did it. Birdsong began to rehearse with the Supremes doing Ballard&#x27;s work as in her place, and when Ballard was fired from the Supremes at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, and forced Ballard back to Detroit, Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.

During her tenure with the group, Gordy mostly used the Andantes on background vocals to accompany Ross instead of Birdsong nor Wilson. However, when the single, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;, hit number one, the group made their final television appearance with Ross, performing on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on December 21, 1969.

===Post Diana Ross: The &quot;new&quot; Supremes (1970–1972; 1973–1976)===
In 1970, Jean Terrell replaced Ross as lead singer of the Supremes. However, at first, Syreeta Wright was considered a replacement but Terrell was chosen instead. In the new group, both Wilson and Birdsong&#x27;s voices were heard more prominently, including the three albums the group recorded with the Four Tops. The group had a hit with the Four Tops with a cover version of Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;. They scored more chart success at the beginning of the new decade, scoring hits in the United Kingdom, while having several pop and soul hits in the United States, including &quot;Up the Ladder to the Roof&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got the Right to Love&quot;, &quot;Stoned Love&quot;, &quot;Nathan Jones&quot;, and &quot;Floy Joy&quot;. However, Birdsong left to have her first child and was replaced by Lynda Laurence. Birdsong later returned to replace Laurence in 1973 after Laurence left to start a family with her husband Trevor Lawrence. It was also when Scherrie Payne joined the group as well, replacing Jean Terrell. During that period, Birdsong contributed to two albums: &quot;The Supremes&quot; (1975) and &quot;High Energy&quot; (1976). Birdsong was later fired from the Supremes in February 1976.

===Later career===
In June 1977, Wilson performed a &quot;farewell&quot; concert with The Supremes (by then Scherrie Payne and Susaye Greene) and thereafter embarked on a solo career. Later that fall, Wilson was forced to play several Supremes dates, most notably in South America, that Payne and Greene would not fulfill on such short notice. Rather than risk lawsuits, Wilson recruited Birdsong and Debbie Sharpe as her backups, performing under &quot;Mary Wilson of the Supremes&quot;. 

After leaving the Supremes, Birdsong worked at UCLA Medical Center under her married name of Cindy Hewlett, and then went to work for Suzanne de Passe at Motown Records. In 1983, Birdsong joined former Supremes Mary Wilson and Diana Ross in a one-off reunion on the &quot;Motown 25&quot; anniversary television special. In 1986, she was a member of the Former Ladies of the Supremes along with Terrell and Payne but left to pursue a solo career in music. Once again, she was replaced by Laurence in the group. She briefly recorded for the small Hi–Hat Records with a single &quot;Dancing Room&quot;.

In 1999, she reunited with The Bluebelles, who changed their name to Labelle after Birdsong&#x27;s departure, for the first time in thirty-two years as the group accepted an R&amp;B Foundation Award for Lifetime Achievement, singing &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; together. In 2004, Birdsong joined Mary Wilson and Kelly Rowland (of Destiny&#x27;s Child) to perform a medley of Supreme hits for the &quot;Motown 45&quot; anniversary television special.

==Personal life==

Birdsong married Charles Hewlett in August 1970 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. In attendance were then singing partners Jean Terrell and Mary Wilson. This was Birdsong&#x27;s first marriage and Hewlett&#x27;s second marriage. Birdsong filed for divorce in March 1975, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. The couple have one son, Charles, known as David.

In June 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed a full length article on Birdsong&#x27;s health and financial status. Her family revealed that she suffered several debilitating strokes, and expressed frustration with Birdsong&#x27;s longtime caretaker and roommate Rochelle Lander who they said was preventing family support. However, in 2021, Birdsong was removed from her apartment by Los Angeles police and was put in a skilled nursing facility. A judge awarded the family conservatorship in October 2023.

In April 2024, the New York Times printed a follow-up article, chronicling Birdsong&#x27;s continued challenges. Her son David filed a lawsuit against Brad Herman who had been credited for &quot;rescuing&quot; Cindy from her financial and medical woes.

==Kidnapping==
In December 1969, Birdsong was kidnapped while returning to her Los Angeles apartment with then–boyfriend Hewlett and their friend, Howard Meek. The intruder forced Birdsong to tie up the two, then forced her downstairs into her car at knifepoint. Birdsong managed to unlock the car door while Collier was driving and jumped out of the vehicle onto the Long Beach Freeway to safety. She was &#x27;hospitalised with cuts, bruises and knife wounds.&#x27; Days later, Charles Collier, a maintenance man at Birdsong&#x27;s apartment, surrendered himself in to Las Vegas police. In April the following year Collier was sentenced to five years to life in the (California) State Prison. Collier claimed he &#x27;did not know why&#x27; he kidnapped Birdsong.

<doc id="633241" wikidata="Q653318" url="?curid=633241" title="Silicosis">
<text>Silicosis is a form of occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust. It is marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of pneumoconiosis. Silicosis, particularly the acute form, is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, fever, and cyanosis (bluish skin). It may often be misdiagnosed as pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pneumonia, or tuberculosis. Using workplace controls, silicosis is almost always a preventable disease.
Silicosis resulted in at least 43,000 deaths globally in 2013, down from at least 50,000 deaths in 1990.
The name &quot;silicosis&quot; (from the Latin &quot;silex&quot;, or flint) was originally used in 1870 by Achille Visconti (1836–1911), prosector in the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing in dust dates to ancient Greeks and Romans. Agricola, in the mid-16th century, wrote about lung problems from dust inhalation in miners. In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini noted asthmatic symptoms and sand-like substances in the lungs of stone cutters. The negative effects of milled calcined flint on the lungs of workers had been noted less than 10 years after its introduction as a raw material to the British ceramics industry in 1720. 

With industrialization, as opposed to hand tools, came increased production of dust. The pneumatic hammer drill was introduced in 1897 and sandblasting was introduced in about 1904, both significantly contributing to the increased prevalence of silicosis. In 1938, the United States Department of Labor, led by then Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, produced a film titled &quot;Stop Silicosis&quot; to discuss the results of a year-long study done concerning a rise in the number of silicosis cases across the United States.

In the early 21st century, an epidemic of silicosis was caused by the unsafe manufacturing of engineered stone countertops containing quartz (and obsidian), which became popular.

==Signs and symptoms==
Because chronic silicosis is slow to develop, signs and symptoms may not appear until years after exposure. Signs and symptoms include:

* Dyspnea (shortness of breath) exacerbated by exertion
* Cough, often persistent and sometimes severe
* Fatigue
* Tachypnea (rapid breathing) which is often labored 
* Loss of appetite and weight loss
* Chest pain
* Fever
* Gradual darkening of skin (blue skin)
* Gradual dark shallow rifts in nails eventually leading to cracks as protein fibers within nail beds are destroyed

In advanced cases, the following may also occur:
* Cyanosis, pallor along upper parts of body (blue skin)
* Cor pulmonale (right ventricle heart disease)
* Respiratory insufficiency
Patients with silicosis are particularly susceptible to tuberculosis (TB) infection—known as silicotuberculosis. The reason for the increased risk—3 fold increased incidence—is not well understood. It is thought that silica damages pulmonary macrophages, inhibiting their ability to kill mycobacteria. Even workers with prolonged silica exposure, but without silicosis, are at a similarly increased risk for TB.

Pulmonary complications of silicosis also include chronic bronchitis and airflow limitation (indistinguishable from that caused by smoking), non-tuberculous &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; infection, fungal lung infection, compensatory emphysema, and pneumothorax. There are some data revealing an association between silicosis and certain autoimmune diseases, including nephritis, scleroderma, and systemic lupus erythematosus, especially in acute or accelerated silicosis.

In 1996, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reviewed the medical data and classified crystalline silica as &quot;carcinogenic to humans.&quot; The risk was best seen in cases with underlying silicosis, with relative risks for lung cancer of 2–4. Numerous subsequent studies have been published confirming this risk. In 2006, Pelucchi et al. concluded, &quot;The silicosis-cancer association is now established, in agreement with other studies and meta-analysis.&quot;

==Pathophysiology==
When small silica dust particles are inhaled, they can embed themselves deeply into the tiny alveolar sacs and ducts in the lungs, where oxygen and carbon dioxide gases are exchanged. There, the lungs cannot clear out the dust by mucus or coughing.

When fine particles of crystalline silica dust are deposited in the lungs, macrophages that ingest the dust particles will set off an inflammatory response by releasing tumor necrosis factors, interleukin-1, leukotriene B4 and other cytokines. In turn, these stimulate fibroblasts to proliferate and produce collagen around the silica particle, thus resulting in fibrosis and the formation of the nodular lesions. The inflammatory effects of crystalline silica are apparently mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Characteristic lung tissue pathology in nodular silicosis consists of fibrotic nodules with concentric &quot;onion-skinned&quot; arrangement of collagen fibers, central hyalinization, and a cellular peripheral zone, with lightly birefringent particles seen under polarized light. The silicotic nodule represents a specific tissue response to crystalline silica. In acute silicosis, microscopic pathology shows a periodic acid-Schiff positive alveolar exudate (alveolar lipoproteinosis) and a cellular infiltrate of the alveolar walls.

===Silica===

Silicon (Si) is the second most common element in the Earth&#x27;s crust after oxygen. The compound silica, also known as silicon dioxide (SiO2), is formed from silicon and oxygen atoms. Since oxygen and silicon make up about 75% of the Earth&#x27;s crust, the compound silica is quite common. It is found in many rocks, such as granite, sandstone, gneiss and slate, and in some metallic ores. Silica can be a main component of sand. It can also be in soil, mortar, plaster, and shingles. The cutting, breaking, crushing, drilling, grinding, or abrasive blasting of these materials may produce fine to ultra fine airborne silica dust.

Silica occurs in three forms: crystalline, microcrystalline (or cryptocrystalline) and amorphous (non-crystalline). &quot;Free&quot; silica is composed of pure silicon dioxide, not combined with other elements, whereas silicates (e.g., talc, asbestos, and mica) are SiO2 combined with an appreciable portion of cations.

* Crystalline silica exists in seven different forms (polymorphs), depending upon the temperature of formation. The main three polymorphs are quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite. Quartz is the second most common mineral in the world (next to feldspar).
* Microcrystalline silica consists of minute quartz crystals bonded together with amorphous silica. Examples include flint and chert.
* Amorphous silica consists of kieselgur (diatomite), from the skeletons of diatoms, and vitreous silica, produced by heating and then rapid cooling of crystalline silica. Amorphous silica is less toxic than crystalline, but not biologically inert, and diatomite, when heated, can convert to tridymite or cristobalite.

Silica flour is nearly pure SiO2 finely ground. Silica flour has been used as a polisher or buffer, as well as paint extender, abrasive, and filler for cosmetics. Silica flour has been associated with all types of silicosis, including acute silicosis.

Silicosis is due to deposition of fine respirable dust (less than 10 micrometers in diameter) containing crystalline silicon dioxide in the form of alpha-quartz, cristobalite, or tridymite.

==Diagnosis==
There are three key elements to the diagnosis of silicosis. First, the patient history should reveal exposure to sufficient silica dust to cause this illness. Second, chest imaging (usually chest x-ray) that reveals findings consistent with silicosis. Third, there are no underlying illnesses that are more likely to be causing the abnormalities. Physical examination is usually unremarkable unless there is complicated disease. The examination findings are not specific for silicosis.

Pulmonary function testing may reveal airflow limitation, restrictive defects, reduced diffusion capacity, mixed defects, or may be normal, especially without complicated disease. Most cases of silicosis do not require tissue biopsy for diagnosis, but this may be necessary in some cases, primarily to exclude other conditions. Assessment of alveolar crystal burden in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may aid diagnosis.

For uncomplicated silicosis, chest x-ray will confirm the presence of small (&lt; 10 mm) nodules in the lungs, especially in the upper lung zones. Using the ILO classification system, these are of profusion 1/0 or greater and shape/size &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, or &quot;r&quot;. Lung zone involvement and profusion increases with disease progression. In advanced cases of silicosis, large opacity (&gt; 1 cm) occurs from coalescence of small opacities, particularly in the upper lung zones. 

With retraction of the lung tissue, there is compensatory emphysema. Enlargement of the hilum is common with chronic and accelerated silicosis. In about 5–10% of cases, the nodes will calcify circumferentially, producing so-called &quot;eggshell&quot; calcification. This finding is not pathognomonic (diagnostic) of silicosis. In some cases, the pulmonary nodules may also become calcified.

A computed tomography or CT scan can also provide a mode detailed analysis of the lungs, and can reveal cavitation due to concomitant mycobacterial infection.
===Classification===
Classification of silicosis is made according to the disease&#x27;s severity (including radiographic pattern), onset, and rapidity of progression. These include:
;Chronic simple silicosis: Usually resulting from long-term exposure (10 years or more) to relatively low concentrations of silica dust and usually appearing 10–30 years after first exposure. This is the most common type of silicosis. Patients with this type of silicosis, especially early on, may not have obvious signs or symptoms of disease, but abnormalities may be detected by x-ray. Chronic cough and exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath) are common findings. Radiographically, chronic simple silicosis reveals a profusion of small (&lt;10 mm in diameter) opacities, typically rounded, and predominating in the upper lung zones.
;Accelerated silicosis: Silicosis that develops 5–10 years after first exposure to higher concentrations of silica dust. Symptoms and x-ray findings are similar to chronic simple silicosis, but occur earlier and tend to progress more rapidly. Patients with accelerated silicosis are at greater risk for complicated disease, including progressive massive fibrosis (PMF).
;Complicated silicosis: Silicosis can become &quot;complicated&quot; by the development of severe scarring (progressive massive fibrosis, or also known as conglomerate silicosis), where the small nodules gradually become confluent, reaching a size of 1 cm or greater. PMF is associated with more severe symptoms and respiratory impairment than simple disease. Silicosis can also be complicated by other lung disease, such as tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, and fungal infection, certain autoimmune diseases, and lung cancer. Complicated silicosis is more common with accelerated silicosis than with the chronic variety.
;Acute silicosis: Silicosis that develops a few weeks to 5 years after exposure to high concentrations of respirable silica dust. This is also known as silicoproteinosis. Symptoms of acute silicosis include more rapid onset of severe disabling shortness of breath, cough, weakness, and weight loss, often leading to death. The x-ray usually reveals a diffuse alveolar filling with air bronchograms, described as a ground-glass appearance, and similar to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and alveolar cell lung cancer.

==Prevention==

Using the Hierarchy of Controls, there are various methods of preventing exposure to respirable crystalline silica. The best way to prevent silicosis is to avoid worker exposure to dust containing respirable crystalline silica. The next best preventive measure is to control the dust. Water-integrated tools are often used where dust is created during certain tasks. To avoid dust accumulating on clothing and skin, wear a disposable protective suit or seal clothes in an airtight bag and, if possible, shower once returning home. 

When dust starts accumulating around a workplace, and the use of water-integrated tools is not feasible, an industrial vacuum should be used to contain and transport dust to a safe location for disposal. Dust can also be controlled through personal dry air filtering. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a measure of last resort when attempting to control exposure to respirable crystalline silica.

Preventing silicosis may require specific measures. One example is during tunnel construction where purpose-designed cabins are used in addition to air scrubbers to filter the air during construction. Items to be considered when selecting respiratory protection include whether it provides the correct level of protection, if facial fit testing has been provided, if the wearer is absent of facial hair, and how filters will be replaced.

Exposure to siliceous dusts in the ceramics industry is reduced by either processing and using the source materials as aqueous suspension or as damp solids, or by the use of dust control measures such as local exhaust ventilation. These have been mandated by legislation, such as &quot;The Pottery (Health and Welfare) Special Regulations 1950&quot;. The Health and Safety Executive in the UK has produced guidelines on controlling exposure to respirable crystalline silica in potteries, and the British Ceramics Federation provide, as a free download, a guidance booklet. 

==Treatment==
Silicosis is a permanent disease with no cure. Treatment options currently available focus on alleviating the symptoms and preventing any further progress of the condition. These include:

* Whole lung lavage. this method involves repeatedly flushing the lungs with saline under intravenous anesthesia, together with mechanical ventilation, to remove the pathogenic factor
* Stopping further exposure to airborne silica, silica dust and other lung irritants, including tobacco smoking.
* Cough suppressants.
* Antibiotics for bacterial lung infection.
* Tuberculosis (TB) prophylaxis for those with positive tuberculin skin test or IGRA blood test.
* Prolonged anti-tuberculosis (multi-drug regimen) for those with active TB.
* Chest physiotherapy to help the bronchial drainage of mucus.
* Oxygen administration to treat hypoxemia, if present.
* Bronchodilators to facilitate breathing.
* Lung transplantation to replace the damaged lung tissue is the most effective treatment, but is associated with severe risks of its own from the lung transplant surgery as well as from consequences of long-term immunosuppression (e.g., opportunistic infections). 
* For acute silicosis, bronchoalveolar lavage may alleviate symptoms, but does not decrease overall mortality.
* Preliminary work utilising whole lung lavage for patients with artificial stone-associated silicosis has shown significant radiological improvement following whole lung lavage.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, silicosis resulted in 46,000 deaths in 2013, down from 55,000 deaths in 1990.

===Occupational silicosis===

Silicosis is the most common occupational lung disease worldwide. It occurs everywhere, but is especially common in developing countries. From 1991 to 1995, China reported more than 24,000 deaths due to silicosis each year. It also affects developed nations. In the United States, it is estimated that between one and two million workers have had occupational exposure to crystalline silica dust and 59,000 of these workers will develop silicosis sometime in the course of their lives.

According to CDC data, silicosis in the United States is relatively rare. The incidence of deaths due to silicosis declined by 84% between 1968 and 1999, and only 187 deaths in 1999 had silicosis as the underlying or contributing cause. Additionally, cases of silicosis in Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio are highly correlated to industry and occupation.

The latest data from The Health and Safety Executive shows that there are typically between 10 and 20 annual silicosis deaths in recent years, with an average of 12 per year over the last 10 years. In 2019 in the UK, there were 12 deaths in 10 years.

Although silicosis has been a known occupational disease for centuries, the industrialization of mining has led to an increase in silicosis cases. Pneumatic drilling in mines and less commonly, mining using explosives, would raise fine-ultra fine crystalline silica dust (rock dust). In the United States, a 1930 epidemic of silicosis due to the construction of the Hawk&#x27;s Nest Tunnel near Gauley Bridge, West Virginia, caused the death of at least 400 workers. Other accounts place the mortality figure at well over 1000 workers, primarily African American transient workers from the southern United States. Workers who became ill were fired and left the region, making an exact mortality account difficult. The Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster is known as &quot;America&#x27;s worst industrial disaster&quot;. The prevalence of silicosis led some men to grow what is called a miner&#x27;s mustache, in an attempt to intercept as much dust as possible.

Chronic simple silicosis has been reported to occur from environmental exposures to silica in regions with high silica soil content and frequent dust storms.

Also, the mining establishment of Delamar Ghost Town, Nevada, was ruined by a dry-mining process that produced a silicosis-causing dust. After hundreds of deaths from silicosis, the town was nicknamed &quot;The Widowmaker&quot;. The problem in those days was somewhat resolved with an addition of a nozzle to the drill which sprayed a mist of water, turning dust raised by drilling into mud, but this inhibited mining work.

Because of work-exposure to silica dust, silicosis is an occupational hazard to construction, railroad, demolition, mining, sandblasting, quarry, tunnelling, ceramics and foundry workers, as well as grinders, stone cutters, stone countertops, refractory brick workers, tombstone workers, workers in the oil and gas industry, pottery workers, fiberglass manufacturing, glass manufacturing, flint knappers and others. Brief or casual exposure to low levels of crystalline silica dust are said to not produce clinically significant lung disease.

In less developed countries where work conditions are poor and respiratory equipment is seldom used, the life expectancy is low (e.g. for silver miners in Potosí, Bolivia, is around 40 years due to silicosis).

Recently, silicosis in Turkish denim sandblasters was detected as a new cause of silicosis due to recurring, poor working conditions.

Silicosis is seen in horses associated with inhalation of dust from certain cristobalite-containing soils in California.

Social realist artist Noel Counihan depicted men who worked in industrial mines in Australia in the 1940s dying of silicosis in his series of six prints, &#x27;The miners&#x27; (1947 linocuts).

A recent rise of cases in Australia has been associated with the manufacture and installation of engineered stone bench tops in kitchens and bathrooms. Engineered stone contains a very high proportion of silica. The Australian Government Department of Health established a National Dust Disease Taskforce in response to the number of reported cases of silicosis in 2018. Workplace health and safety regulations for cutting these bench tops have been tightened in response. The Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union, the major workplace trade union representing construction workers in Australia, has called for a nationwide ban on high-silicon engineered stone by 2024, and stated that it will ban its members from using the material if a governmental ban is not put in place.

Silicosis has also been identified as one of many long-term health outcomes for first responders from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, after having been exposed to dust containing high concentrations of respirable crystalline silica, as well as other metals and toxins.

===Desert lung disease===

A non-occupational form of silicosis has been described that is caused by long-term exposure to sand dust in desert areas, with cases reported from the Sahara, Libyan desert and the Negev. The disease is caused by deposition of this dust in the lung. Desert lung disease may be related to Al Eskan disease, a lung disorder thought to be caused by exposure to sand dust containing organic antigens, which was first diagnosed after the 1990 Gulf war. The relative importance of the silica particles themselves and the microorganisms that they carry in these health effects remains unclear.

== Regulation in the US ==
In March 2016, OSHA officially mandated that companies must provide certain safety measures for employees who work with or around silica, in order to prevent silicosis, lung cancer, and other silica-related diseases.

=== Key provisions ===
One of the main updates to OSHA&#x27;s silica standard was the reduction of the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for respirable crystalline silica from 250 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air, averaged over an 8-hour shift. The updated standard also shifts the focus of controlling silica exposure from the use of PPE (respirators) to the use of engineering controls (such as using water-integrated tools or vacuum systems) and administrative controls (limiting exposure time per shift). Employers are still required to provide respirators when engineering and administrative controls cannot adequately limit exposure.

Additional provisions include limiting worker access to high exposure areas, signage requirements in high exposure areas, the development of a written exposure control plan, medical exams to highly exposed workers (optional for exposed employees), and training for workers on silica risks and how to limit exposures. Special equipment may be needed to prevent machine water from evaporating and leaving behind dust. The standard also provides requirements for cleaning up the slurry left behind when water-integrated tools are used as an engineering control.

The medical exams include a discussion with a physician or licensed health care provider (PLHCP) of prior respiratory health, chest X-ray, pulmonary function test, latent tuberculosis infection, and any other tests deemed necessary by the PLHCP. These medical exams are to occur within 30 days of the initial assignment that includes silica exposure and must be made available for renewal at least every three years unless the PLHCP deems otherwise.

As part of the updated standard, OSHA created a table of specific engineering and administrative control methods to reduce silica exposure when using specific tools in 18 different applications that are known to create an exposure to silica from stationary masonry saws to using handheld grinders.

An additional provision exists for small business who are provided flexibility.

=== Compliance schedule ===

Both standards contained in the final rule took effect on June 23, 2016, after which industries had one to five years to comply with most requirements, based on the following schedule:
* Construction – June 23, 2017, one year after the effective date.
* General Industry and Maritime – June 23, 2018, two years after the effective date.
* Hydraulic Fracturing – June 23, 2018, two years after the effective date for all provisions except Engineering Controls, which have a compliance date of June 23, 2021.

<text>Overtime (OT) or extra time is an additional period of play to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw where the scores are the same. In some sports, this extra period is played only if the game is required to have a clear winner, as in single-elimination tournaments where only one team or players can advance to the next round or win the tournament and replays are not allowed.

The rules of overtime or extra time vary between sports and even different competitions. Some may employ &quot;sudden death&quot;, where the first player or team who scores immediately wins the game. In others, play continues until a specified time has elapsed, and only then is the winner declared. If the contest remains tied after the extra session, depending on the rules, the match may immediately end as a draw, additional periods may be played, or a different tiebreaking procedure such as a penalty shootout may be used instead.

==Association football ==
===Knock-out contests (including professional competition)===
In association football knockout competitions or competition stages, teams play an extra 30 minutes, called extra time, when the deciding leg (or replay of a tie) has not produced a winner by the end of normal or full-time. It follows a short break (traditionally five minutes) where players remain on or around the field of play and comprises two 15-minute periods, with teams changing ends in between. Although the Laws of the Game state that extra time is one of the approved methods to decide a winner, competitions are not bound to adopt extra time, and each competition is free to choose any method designated in the Laws of the Game to decide a winner.

In a one-off tie or deciding replay, level scores nearly always go to extra time but this only applies to the FIFA competitions and the first-tier continental national team competitions. In games played over two legs at the continental levels (such as the three–tier men&#x27;s continental club competitions and the women&#x27;s continental club competitions), domestic levels (such as , DFB-Pokal and the Coppa Italia semi-finals or Bundesliga relegation and promotion play-offs) or even at lower levels (such as the English Football League play-offs), teams only play extra time in the second leg where the aggregate score – then normally followed by an away goals rule – has not produced a winner first, however starting the 2021–22 season, UEFA decided to abolish it for all club competitions and changed with the penalty shootout if the aggregate is still tied after the extra time. Ties in the FA Cup used to be decided by as many replays as necessary until one produces a winner within normal time rather than have any extra time or shootouts though, nowadays, replays are limited to just one with the game going to extra time if teams are still level. Equally, CONMEBOL has historically never used extra time in any of the competitions it directly organizes except only in the final match of a competition, such as the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana. The score in games or ties resorting to extra time are often recorded with the abbreviation a.e.t. (after extra time) usually accompanying the earlier score after regulation time. The two-legged format for the club competition finals with this rule is still used in CONCACAF club competitions where an away goals rule still takes place.

Ties that are still without a winner after extra time are usually broken by kicks from the penalty spot, commonly called a penalty shootout. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, many international matches tried to reduce this by employing the golden goal (also called &quot;sudden death&quot;) or silver goal rules (the game ending if a team has the lead after the first 15-minute period of extra time), but competitions have not retained these. The abbreviation &quot;a.s.d.e.t.&quot; refers to a result &quot;after sudden death extra time&quot;.

===U.S. collegiate rules===
Up until 2021, under NCAA college soccer rules, all games that remained tied after 90 minutes had an overtime period. A sudden-death golden goal rule was applied, with the game ending as soon as an overtime goal was scored. If neither team scored in the two 10-minute halves, the game ended in a draw unless it was a conference or national championship tournament game. A playoff game tied after two overtime periods then moved to a penalty kick shoot-out with the winner determined by the teams alternating kicks from the penalty mark.

Since the 2022 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s season, the golden goal has been abolished during the regular season. Since 2024, games that ended in a draw during a conference or national tournament game involve two 10-minute periods, with golden goal. A playoff game tied after two overtime periods still moves to a penalty kick shoot-out with the winner determined by the teams alternating kicks from the penalty mark.

===U.S. high school rules===
High school rules vary depending on the state and conference, but most will have a sudden-death overtime procedure wherein the game ends upon scoring a golden goal, although in some instances the overtime will go until completion with the team in the lead after time expires (i.e., silver goal rules) declared the winner. The overtime period length may vary, but it is commonly 10 minutes long. Depending on the state, if the game is still tied at the end of the first overtime:

* As many additional overtime periods – golden or silver goal rules – may be played as needed to determine a winner.
* After one or more overtime periods result in the score remaining tied, a shootout procedure may be played. In a shootout, the coaches or team captains select five players to shoot penalty kicks with teams alternating kicks from the penalty mark in an attempt to put the ball into the net. The procedure continues until each team has taken five kicks, or, if one side has scored more successful kicks, the other could not possibly reach with its remaining kicks.
* If both teams make the same number of successful penalty kicks after all eligible players have taken their first kick, the procedure repeats; the teams are not required to follow the same order of kickers as was used for the first kick, and may replace one or more of the original kickers. The procedure repeats until one side has successfully converted more penalty kicks in a set of five attempts.
* Depending on the state or conference, the game may go directly to a penalty shootout rather than playing overtime.
* Under rules published by the NFHS, a section called &quot;Sample Tie-Breaking Procedure&quot; is included, but state associations are not required to adopt those procedures.

==American and Canadian football==

===National Football League===
In the National Football League (NFL), sudden death overtime periods are played during regular-season and postseason games, but not during preseason games from to and since . Regular-season games end in a tie if the score is still tied after one 10-minute overtime period, while in postseason games, 15-minute overtime periods are played until a winner is determined.

====Procedure====
At the start of overtime, the team captains and officials hold another coin toss. Similarly to the coin toss at the beginning of the game, the team that wins the coin toss chooses whether they want to receive or kick the opening kickoff, while the other team chooses which end of the field they will defend. Gameplay is conducted similarly to the regulation periods (in contrast with the &quot;Kansas system&quot; used in college football rules), and each team is given two timeouts. Instant replay reviews must be initiated by the replay official, i.e. there are no challenges.

The winner is then decided as follows:
* If the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown on their opening drive, they win the game.
* If the team that receives the opening kickoff turns the ball over without scoring (including a turnover on downs) on their opening drive, the next team to score wins the game. 
* If the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a field goal on their opening drive, the other team gets a chance to possess the ball.
**If the trailing team scores a touchdown on that possession, &quot;they&quot; win the game.
**If the trailing team ties the score by scoring a field goal of their own, the next team to score wins. 
**If the trailing team turns the ball over without scoring, including a turnover on downs, they lose the game.
* Any score by the defense (e.g., safety, fumble or interception returned for a touchdown) results in a win for that team. 
* The point after touchdown is not attempted if the game ends on a touchdown.
* The game ends in a tie if the score is still even at the end of the 10-minute overtime period.

Because playoff games cannot be tied, the overtime procedure is modified for these games:
* Each team gets three timeouts instead of two. 
* Both teams get one possession, i.e. the team receiving the opening kickoff does not win immediately if they score a touchdown on the initial possession. 
* Overtime periods are 15 minutes instead of 10. 
* If the score is still even at the end of the first overtime period, or the second team to possess the ball has not completed their initial possession at that point, additional 15-minute overtime periods are played until a winner is determined.
*If more than one overtime period is needed:
** There is a two-minute intermission between overtime periods.
** Second and fourth-quarter timing rules apply during the second overtime period.
** The rules stipulate that there is no halftime break after the second overtime period and provide for another coin toss at the end of every fourth overtime period; however, no playoff game to date has extended into a third overtime.

====History====

The National Football League (NFL) introduced sudden-death overtime for any divisional tiebreak games beginning in 1940, and for championship games beginning in 1946. The first postseason game to be played under these rules was the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants (the &quot;Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;).

In 1974, the NFL adopted sudden-death overtime for regular season and preseason games: if the score is tied after regulation time, one additional period is played.

Until the 2016 season, the period was 15 minutes in all games: in , it was changed to 10 minutes in regular season games, while overtime in preseason games was abolished in , and it remains 15 minutes for playoff games.

In March 2010, NFL owners voted to amend overtime rules for postseason games; the changes were extended to the regular season in 2012.

Since no 2010 postseason game went into overtime, the first overtime game played after the implementation of this rule came in the wild-card round in 2011. Incidentally, this was also the shortest overtime in NFL history until 2019; Pittsburgh Steelers kicker Shaun Suisham kicked off and the ball went out of the back of the end zone, resulting in a touchback and no time off the clock. Tim Tebow, then with the Denver Broncos, threw an 80-yard touchdown pass on the first play to Demaryius Thomas to give the Broncos the win in only 11 seconds.

The first time the &quot;first-possession field goal&quot; rule was enforced occurred on 9 September 2012, the first week of the season, in a game between the Minnesota Vikings and Jacksonville Jaguars. Minnesota&#x27;s Blair Walsh kicked a 38-yard field goal on the Vikings&#x27; first drive. When Jacksonville regained possession, they failed to gain a first down, losing possession and the game on a failed fourth-down conversion.

The first overtime in which both teams scored occurred on 18 November 2012, in a game between the Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars; the Texans won 43–37. The first overtime game that ended in a tie after both teams scored in overtime occurred on 24 November 2013, when the Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers played to a 26–26 tie.

On 5 February 2017, a Super Bowl went into overtime for the first time, with the New England Patriots defeating the Atlanta Falcons, 34–28; the Patriots scored a touchdown on their initial possession, so the Falcons never received the ball in overtime.

In 2019, in their season finale against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Falcons finished the game with a pick-six seven seconds into overtime by Deion Jones, breaking the record for the shortest overtime in NFL history.

A rule change gives both teams one possession to start the first overtime in playoff games, no matter whether or not a touchdown is scored first. The first and only game to go into overtime under this rule was Super Bowl LVIII following the season. However, that game was not impacted by the rule change; the San Francisco 49ers kicked a field goal on their first possession and the Kansas City Chiefs would have gotten a possession under the pre-2022 rule as well.

===Other professional football leagues===
The Arena Football League and NFL Europe used a variant in which each team is guaranteed one possession. Whoever is leading after one possession won the game; if the teams remain tied after one possession, the game went to sudden death. This procedure was used by the United Football League in its inaugural 2009 season. This included both games of all semifinals series. All overtime periods thereafter were true sudden death periods.

The short-lived World Football League, for its inaugural 1974 season (the same year the NFL established sudden death in the regular season), used a fifteen-minute quarter of extra time, divided into two halves. It was not sudden death.

The New York Pro Football League, a 1910s-era league that eventually had several of its teams join the NFL, used the replay to settle ties in its playoff tournament. The replay was used in the 1919 tournament to decide the championship between the Buffalo Prospects and the Rochester Jeffersons. The teams had played to a tie on Thanksgiving; Buffalo won the replay 20–0 to win the championship.

The United Football League settles ties this way: teams will try three rounds of 2-point conversions from the three-yard line. Coin toss is called by the visiting team; winner of the toss can choose to possess the ball first or defend. Whoever scores the most points after three rounds wins it; otherwise, teams play sudden-death rounds until one team scores. One timeout can be called per overtime round.

===College, high school, and Canadian football===
In college (since the 1996 season) and high school football, as well as the Canadian Football League (since the 2000 season) and the short-lived Alliance of American Football, an &quot;overtime procedure&quot; is used to determine the winner. This method is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Kansas Playoff&quot;, or &quot;Kansas Plan&quot; because of its origins for high school football in that state. A brief summary of the rules:
*A coin toss determines which side attempts to score first, and at which end zone the scores are attempted.
*Each team in turn receives one possession, starting with first-and-10 from a fixed point on the opponent&#x27;s side of the field:
** Under NCAA rules, the first possession of overtime begins at the opponent&#x27;s 25-yard line. When overtime was introduced, all possessions for each team started at that point, but the procedure for subsequent overtimes has changed twice since 2019.
*** In 2019 and 2020, the first four possessions for each team (if necessary) started at the opponent&#x27;s 25. All subsequent possessions were two-point conversion attempts taken from the 3-yard line, the standard starting point for that play under NCAA rules, and were scored as conversions.
*** Since 2021, the first two possessions for each team start at the opponent&#x27;s 25. All subsequent possessions are two-point conversion attempts.
** Under standard high school football rules, the possession begins at the 10-yard line, and all plays are goal-to-go. However, the high school rulebook only recommends the overtime procedure and allows state associations to use their own; the 15-, 20-, and 25-yard lines are variously used. The AAF also used the 10-yard line as its starting point.
** In the CFL, where a single point can be scored on a punt, the possession begins at the 35-yard line.
*The play clock runs as normal. There is no game clock, and all play is otherwise untimed.
*A team&#x27;s possession ends when it (or the defense) scores, misses a field goal, or turns over the ball (either on downs or by the defense otherwise gaining possession).
*In high school, college and the CFL, a field goal can be kicked at any time. Thus, if the first team fails to score, the opponent, already usually in field goal range, can end the game by kicking one (in the CFL, as previously noted, one can do the same with a single). In the AAF, no field goals were allowed at any time during the playoff.
*As usual, a touchdown by the offense is followed by a try for one or two points. In NCAA football, since 2021, teams must attempt a two-point conversion after a touchdown in double overtime; all overtime procedures thereafter consist of two-point conversion attempts and are scored as such. Since 2010, CFL teams must also attempt the two-point conversion after any touchdown in overtime. The AAF required two-point conversions after any touchdown.
*In college football, the defense may score a touchdown on a play on which it gains possession by turnover; such a play will satisfy the condition of each team having a possession and will therefore end the game. In high school football, the defense is generally not allowed to score if it gains possession, although the Oregon School Activities Association adopted the college rule experimentally in 2005, and the two main high school governing bodies in Texas, the University Interscholastic League and Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools, use NCAA football rules (as did Massachusetts through the 2018 season, after which it adopted standard high school rules). If scoring is not allowed or the turnover play does not end with a score, regardless of the eventual position of the ball at the end of the play, the team assumes offense and will begin their procedure from the specified position on the field.
*Each team receives one charged time-out per offensive or defensive series (except in the CFL).
*If the score remains tied at the end of the first overtime period, the procedure is repeated. The team with the second possession in one overtime will have the first possession in the next overtime.
*In the CFL, there is a limit of two overtime procedures in regular-season games, and if the scores are still level, the game is a tie, but in playoff games, overtime periods are continued until a winner is determined. The AAF did the same, except that regular-season games ended after only one overtime procedure, regardless of the score. (The AAF folded before it ever played any playoff games.)
*In American college and high school football, the overtime periods are continued until a winner is determined.
*All points scored in overtime count as if they were scored in regulation. (This is in contrast to the analogous penalty shootout used in other sports, where shootout points are counted separately and only one point is awarded to the winner; however, this procedure is like extra innings in baseball.)

====Record and notable overtime games====
On two occasions, just two plays were required to determine an overtime winner in an NCAA football game: on 26 September 2002, when Louisville defeated Florida State 26–20 and on 27 September 2003, when Georgia Tech defeated Vanderbilt 24–17.

It is possible for a college game to end after a single play in overtime if the team on defense secures a turnover and returns it for a touchdown: on 9 September 2005, Ohio defeated Pittsburgh 16–10 on an 85-yard interception return by Dion Byrum on the third play of overtime. It is also possible for the defense to get a safety on the first play of overtime (which would also end the game), but this would require the offense to lose 75 yards on the play, which is extremely unlikely (such a scenario is attested in regular play from scrimmage in college football but never in an overtime period).

As of the beginning of the 2024 season, the Tennessee Volunteers have competed in the most overtime college football games, going 15–8 across the 23 games.

The college game with the most overtime periods was on 23 October 2021, when Illinois defeated Penn State, 20–18, in nine overtime periods. Prior to that, five games had been decided in seven overtime periods: Arkansas vs. Ole Miss in 2001, Arkansas vs. Kentucky in 2003, North Texas vs. FIU in 2006, Western Michigan vs. Buffalo in 2017, and LSU vs. Texas A&amp;M in 2018, the latter of which was the impetus for the 2019 rule change which mandated two-point conversion attempts after a set number of overtime periods. In 2024, Georgia defeated Georgia Tech 44–42 in eight overtime periods, the second-longest NCAA game up to that point.

The most overtimes required to decide a bowl game in Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) history is six, which occurred in the 2024 GameAbove Sports Bowl.

====Overtime formats====
The Kansas System was first implemented in 1971. The original Kansas System had each team start on the 10-yard line. Throughout the state that first year, 70 games went into overtime with one game requiring five overtime periods to determine a winner. After the system was reviewed positively by the majority of state&#x27;s coaches and administrators, Kansas State High School Activities Association leadership presented the system to the National Federation of State High School Associations, who approved giving state associations the option of using the overtime system for two years. Two years later the overtime system became a permanent option for state associations use.

Another type of overtime system was once used by the California Interscholastic Federation. Known as the &quot;California tiebreaker&quot;, it was used in high school football from 1968 through the 1970s and 1980s. The California tiebreaker starts with the ball placed at the 50-yard line, and the teams run four plays each (a coin toss decides who gets to go first), alternating possession at the spot of the ball after every play. If no one manages to score (field goals are not allowed), then the team that is in its opponents&#x27; territory at the conclusion of the eight plays is awarded one point and declared the winner. When the California tiebreaker was finally phased out, it was replaced by the Kansas tiebreaker.

The Louisiana High School Athletic Association did not adopt the Kansas tiebreaker for its playoffs until 1977. Prior to this, if a game ended tied, the team with the most first downs was declared the winner; if that was tied, the next criteria was penetrations inside the opponent&#x27;s 20-yard line. On at least two occasions, both of those criteria were even following a drawn match, forcing a replay.

==Basketball==
In basketball, if the score is tied at the end of regulation play, the teams play multiple five-minute overtime periods until a winner is decided. In levels below collegiate/Olympic play, an overtime period is half the length of a standard quarter, i.e., four minutes for high school varsity. The alternating possession rule is used to start all overtime periods under international rules for full-court basketball, while a jump ball is used under high school and NCAA rules, with the arrow reset based on the results of the jump ball to start each overtime. The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, which uses a quarter-possession rule to start periods after the opening jump, also uses a jump ball. The entire overtime period is played; there is no sudden-death provision. All counts of personal fouls against players are carried over for the purpose of disqualifying players. If the score remains tied after an overtime period, this procedure is repeated until a winner is determined.

As many as six overtime periods have been necessary to determine a winner in an NBA game.

In exhibition games (non-competitive play), it is upon the discretion of the coaches and organizers if an overtime is to be played especially if it is a non-tournament game (a one-off event).

Starting in the 2009–10 season, Euroleague Basketball, the organizer of the EuroLeague and EuroCup, introduced a new rule for two-legged ties that eliminated overtime unless necessary to break a tie on aggregate. The rule was first used in the 2009–10 EuroCup quarterfinals (which consist of two-legged ties), although no game in that phase of the competition ended in a regulation draw. Euroleague Basketball extended this rule to all two-legged ties in its competitions, including the EuroLeague, in 2010–11. One game in the qualifying rounds of that season (the only phase of the EuroLeague that uses two-legged ties), specifically the second leg of the third qualifying round tie between Spirou Charleroi and ALBA Berlin, ended in a draw after regulation. No overtime was played in that game because Spirou had won the first leg, and the two-legged tie. Although other competitions use two-legged ties at various stages, the FIBA Europe competitions are the only ones known to use overtime only if the aggregate score after the second game is tied.

A rule change in the FIBA rules effective 1 October 2017 (Article D.4.2) permits drawn games at the end of either leg of the two-legged tie. The definition states, &quot;If the score is tied at the end of the first game, no extra period shall be played.&quot;

In The Basketball Tournament, a 64-team single-elimination tournament held each summer in the U.S. with a $1 million winner-take-all prize, no overtime is played since 2018. Games employ the &quot;Elam Ending&quot;, named after its creator, Ball State University professor Nick Elam, with the idea of making sure the game always ends on a basket. Upon the first dead ball (time-out, foul, violation) with 4 minutes or less remaining in the fourth period, the game clock is turned off (though the shot clock remains active). A target score is set at the current lead score plus eight points (originally seven, but changed for the 2019 edition), and the first team to reach or surpass the target wins. The NBA All-Star Game had used the Elam Ending from 2020 to 2023. The fourth period had no game clock, but the shot clock was active. Instead, a target score is set at the leading score after three periods plus 24 points; the first team to reach or exceed that score by any legal basket (field goal, three-pointer, or free throw) wins the game. The Canadian Elite Basketball League first used the Elam Ending in a 2020 tournament that replaced the season that was scrapped due to COVID-19, using TBT rules except that the target score was set by adding 9 points instead of 8. The CEBL made this permanent starting with its 2021 season.

Starting in 2022–23, the NBA G League adopted a variation of the Elam Ending in regular-season games, calling it the &quot;Final Target Score&quot;. Instead of replacing overtime, the G League is using the Elam Ending as its overtime format. In this implementation, the target score is set by adding 7 points to the tied teams&#x27; score. The teams then play with a shot clock but no game clock, with the game ending once the target score is reached or exceeded. For the G League Winter Showcase, an event held in December in Las Vegas that sees all 30 teams play two games, the Elam Ending is implemented in the same manner as in the NBA All-Star Game, except the target score is the leading score plus 25 (instead of 24).

In 3x3 basketball, a formalized version of the half-court three-on-three game, ties after a 10-minute game are settled by continuing play with no game clock (only the shot clock) until one team scores two additional points: baskets made outside the arc being worth two points and all others being worth one point. The 21-point rule, under which a regulation game ends once either team has reached 21 points, does not apply during overtime; a tie at 20 must go to 22. The team that did not get first possession in the game gets first possession in overtime (as jump balls are not used in 3x3). Individual personal foul counts are not kept at any time during the game; all personal fouls are recorded against the team, and team fouls carry over to overtime.

==Ice hockey==
Ties are common in ice hockey due to the game&#x27;s low-scoring nature. If the score is tied at the end of regulation play, certain leagues play overtime.
* NHL (regular season): If a game is tied after regulation time (three 20-minute periods), the teams play in a sudden-death five-minute overtime period, with a goaltender and three skaters per side (as opposed to the standard five). If regulation time ends while a power play is in progress, the team with the advantage starts overtime with more than three skaters (four, or rarely five), and maintains its advantage for the duration of the penalty. Similarly, if a penalty is called in overtime, the player is removed from the ice (or one of the skaters if the penalized player is the goaltender), but can be replaced, while the non-penalized team receives an extra skater for the duration of the penalty. If nobody scores in the overtime period, the teams engage in a penalty shootout where three skaters, selected by the head coaches, go one-on-one against the opposing goaltender, taking the puck at center ice for a penalty shot. If the shootout remains tied after the initial three rounds, additional rounds are played until there is a winner; no player may participate in a shootout twice unless the entire active roster (excluding the backup goaltender) has been exhausted. The greatest number of shooters in a single shootout was 40 during a game between the Florida Panthers and Washington Capitals. Panthers player Nick Bjugstad gave Florida a 2–1 victory on a trick move.

:The 5-minute overtime period was introduced for regular season games beginning with the 1983–84 NHL season, but with teams at full strength on the ice. Overtime in the regular season was reduced to four skaters a side starting in the 2000-2001 season. The shootout was introduced for the 2005–06 NHL regular season, thus abolishing tie games. Previously, ties during the regular season were allowed to stand if not resolved in overtime. Starting in the 2015–16 season, overtime was reduced to three skaters a side.
* NHL (postseason and all tiebreaker games): Following an intermission, multiple full 20-minute periods are played. Teams remain at full strength unless this is affected by penalties. A goal ends the game in sudden death; if neither team scores, this procedure is repeated after the intermission. The teams change ends after each period. This has made for lengthy games, with some going as far as five or six overtimes before the deciding goal is scored.
* NCAA (regular season): Effective with the 2020–21 season, all regular-season men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s games that are tied at the end of regulation use the NHL regular-season overtime procedure (5 minutes, sudden death, three skaters per side unless affected by penalties). Ties at the end of regulation stand in nonconference games; conferences may (but are not required to) use the NHL penalty shootout for league games. The so-called &quot;spin-o-rama&quot; move, in which the shooter completes a 360-degree turn with the puck, is banned in NCAA shootouts as of 2020–21. Previously, the teams played the 5-minute overtime at full strength (unless affected by penalties), and all games tied at the end of regulation ended in a tie.
* NCAA (in-season tournaments): For tournaments held during the season (such as the Beanpot and Great Lakes Invitational), in which advancement or determination of a champion is necessary, the new regular-season overtime procedure is used, followed by the NHL shootout procedure. Before 2020–21, organizers had the option of either using the postseason overtime procedure or using the regular-season procedure followed by a shootout. Statistics from a shootout are not counted by the NCAA, and a game decided by a shootout is considered a tie for NCAA tournament selection purposes.
* NCAA (postseason): Same as the NHL postseason overtime procedure above. Games decided in overtime are considered wins or losses rather than ties, regardless of how many overtimes are played.
* International (round robin): As of the 2007 IIHF World Championship, the IIHF instituted the &quot;three-point rule&quot;, which not only awarded the winning team three points for a regulation win, but awarded them two points for a win in a 5-minute overtime period or a game-winning shot (shootout). Games in IIHF round robins can therefore no longer end in a tie. In the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, the NHL&#x27;s tiebreaking procedure at the time was followed: there was a five-minute sudden-death period at four skaters per side, and if the score remained tied after the overtime period, it stood as a tie. The game between Sweden and Finland ended in a 4–4 tie after 65 minutes. The 2016 World Cup of Hockey had the new NHL tiebreaking procedures: in round-robin play, 5-minute sudden-death period with three skaters per side, plus best-of-3-round shootouts and extra rounds if needed.
* International (medal rounds): Various tiebreaking procedures have been used for international tournaments, with all of them save one (World Cup of Hockey 2004) following a common theme: one period varying in length of sudden-death overtime followed by a shootout of five skaters (since 2010, 3) per side (as opposed to the NHL&#x27;s three skaters per side originally; it also differs in that if the shootout does not resolve the tie, the same five skaters [now 3] then shoot again). The length of the overtime period has varied between 5, 10, and 20 minutes, and 5-on-5 and 4-on-4 formats have been used. The most recent format used was at the 2010 Olympics (particularly in the gold medal game); there were 20 minutes of 4-on-4 followed by a shootout. In 2006, it was 20 minutes of 5-on-5. All men&#x27;s games ended in regulation during the medal rounds, while the women&#x27;s semifinal between the United States and Sweden required a shootout to determine the winner. At the World Cup of Hockey in 2004, the NHL&#x27;s postseason tiebreaking procedure was used (multiple 20-minute periods of 5-on-5 until a goal is scored). The only overtime game in the playoff round was the semifinal between the Czech Republic and Canada. Canada won 4–3 with a goal at 2:16 of overtime. The 2016 World Cup of Hockey had the same overtime procedure as the 2004 event. Since 2019, the gold medal game for the World Championships and Olympics uses multiple 20-minute 3-on-3 periods until one team scores, which wins the game.

==Handball==
When a tie needs to be broken in handball, two straight 5-minute overtimes are played. If the teams are still tied after that, this overtime procedure is repeated once more; a further draw will result in a penalty shootout.

==Baseball and softball==

Baseball and softball are unique among the popular North American team sports in that they do not use a game clock. However, if the regulation number of innings are complete (normally nine in baseball and seven in softball) and the score is even, extra innings are played to determine a winner. Complete innings are played, so if a team scores in the top half of the inning, the other team has the chance to play the bottom half of the inning; they will extend the game by tying the score again and win if they take the lead before their third out. The longest professional baseball game ever played, a 1981 minor league baseball game between the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings required 33 innings and over eight hours to complete. The Red Wings had scored in the top half of the 21st inning, but Pawtucket tied the game in the bottom half, extending the game.

Major League Baseball games normally end in a tie only if the game is called off due to weather conditions. In the early decades of baseball (up to the 1920s), a game could also be called off due to nightfall, but this ceased to be a problem once stadiums began installing lights in the 1930s. Two Major League Baseball All-Star Games have ended in a tie; the second 1961 game was called due to rain with the teams tied 1–1 after the ninth inning, and the 2002 game was called after the eleventh inning after both teams had exhausted their supply of pitchers. Since 2022, extra innings in All-Star games had been abolished, settling ties with a three-player, three-swing playoff (plus multiple triple-swing rounds if ties persist) after nine innings of regulation.

The exceptions to this are in Nippon Professional Baseball, Chinese Professional Baseball League, and the Korea Baseball Organization, where the game cannot go beyond 12 innings (in Japan Series, first 7 games only; no such limit thereafter). During the 2011 season the NPB had a game time limit of hours during the regular season; ties are allowed to stand in the regular season and postseason ties are resolved in a full replay, extending a series if necessary. Extra innings are not played in KBO doubleheaders&#x27; first game.

In 2017, the Arizona League and Gulf Coast League served as testing grounds for the softball version of the World Baseball Softball Confederation extra-inning rule that places a runner on second base to start an extra inning of play. That rule also was followed by MLB as an experimental rule in and , now a permanent one.

== Cricket ==

Ties are allowed to stand in most forms of cricket (c.f. Tied Test), but should a winner be necessary (such as in tournament settings), the most commonly used tiebreaking method is the Super Over, which is a limited extra session of the game wherein each team plays an additional six balls (together known as an over) to determine the winner. Tied Super Overs may be followed by another Super Over in some matches, such as (since 2008) the knockout matches of International Cricket Council tournaments. The Super Over originates from Twenty20 cricket, and has been used several times in Twenty20 International games; its first use in a One-Day International was the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final, wherein the Super Over was tied, and the winner then had to be determined by boundary countback (a statistical tiebreaker). Following this event, the ICC changed the rules of its knockout matches so that tied matches continue until one team wins a Super Over.

In the past, a bowlout was used in which bowlers attempted to hit an unguarded wicket. In an International Cricket Council tournament, it was used only once when India beat Pakistan 3–0 in the bowlout after scores were level in the group stage sending India to the Super 8 stage of the competition. 
In the ICC ODI World Cup 2019 Final, the score was decided by a super over with that being tied and England winning it 32–24 on boundary count.

==Rugby league==

Rugby league games in some competitions are decided using overtime systems if scores are level at full-time (80 minutes). One extra time system is golden point, where any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) by a team immediately wins the game. This entails a five-minute period of golden point time, after which the teams switch ends and a second five-minute period begins. Depending on the game&#x27;s status, a scoreless extra time period ends the game as a draw, otherwise play continues until a winner is found.

==Rugby union==
In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the Rugby World Cup, two full-length extra time periods of 10 minutes each are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes, the rules call for a single sudden-death period of 10 minutes to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring, standard World Rugby rules call for a kicking competition to determine the winner. Domestic leagues may use other tiebreakers; for example, playoff games in the French professional leagues that are level at the end of extra time use a set of tiebreakers before going to a kicking competition, with the first tiebreaker being tries scored.

For Example: Exeter Chiefs and Montpellier played in the round of 16 in the European Rugby Champions Cup on April 2, 2023. The match ended 33–33 AET. Instead of a penalty kick shootout, it had a try count-back in which Exeter Chiefs had more tries.

==Rugby sevens==

In the sevens variant of rugby union, extra time is used only in knockout stages of competitions, such as the World Rugby Sevens Series and Rugby World Cup Sevens. Extra time begins one minute after the end of full-time, and is played in multiple 5-minute periods. Unlike the 15-man game, extra time in sevens is true sudden-death, with the first score by either team winning the match. If neither team has scored at the end of a period, the teams change ends. This procedure is repeated until one team scores.

==Other sports==
* In Australian rules football, drawn matches during a season remain as draws, with the premiership points being split 2 points apiece. Extra time is generally played only in finals matches; for example, in the Australian Football League finals, if the scores are level when regular time has expired, two periods of three minutes (five minutes prior to 2020) each (plus time on) are played. If the scores remain level after the extra time has expired, this procedure is repeated (but in true golden point) until the winner is determined. In some competitions, there are no extra time periods and play simply continues under sudden death rules until the next score. The 2013 VFL reserves Grand Final was a notable match decided in this manner. A third period under golden point rules was implemented in 2016, but was never used before the AFL abolished it in 2019.
**Before the 2016 season, the only exception to this rule was the AFL Grand Final, which used a full replay in case of a drawn match, and only used extra time if the score was tied at the end of regular time in the replay. The AFL extended its extra-time procedure to the Grand Final in 2016, thereby abolishing Grand Final replays.
* In most codes of bowling, ties are allowed to stand, but most organizations have tiebreaker procedures should a winner be necessary (such as in tournament settings).
* In gaelic football and hurling, two straight ten-minute periods are played each way after a draw. In major Gaelic football and hurling tournaments, a further two straight five-minute periods may be played each way if the scores are still level; then golden goal thereafter, in two straight five-minute periods.
* In knockout futsal matches, two extra time periods of 5 minutes each are played, with teams changing ends in between. If the teams are still tied after extra time, the match is decided with a penalty shootout.
* In water polo, if the score is tied at the end of regulation play the game goes to penalty shootouts. In college play teams play two straight 3-minute periods, and if still tied multiple 3-minute golden goal periods thereafter. Same for high school, but may incorporate both methods.
* If a game of curling is tied at the end of its prescribed number of rounds (called ends), extra ends are played until there is a winner.
* In netball matches, two straight 7-minute periods of extra time are played, with teams changing ends in between (with no break between periods). If the scores are still tied after the overtime, the match continues uninterrupted. Whoever is up two goals will be the winners. This is known as double overtime should a match end this way. All ANZ Championship matches (2008–2014), ANZ Championship finals (2015–2016), ANZ Premiership, Suncorp Super Netball, Commonwealth Games finals and World Netball Championships finals implement this tiebreaker to ensure a winner.
* In touch football under the Federation of International Touch structure, finals matches that are drawn at full-time progress into an extra time period known as a &quot;drop-off&quot;. During a drop-off, each team reduces their on-field playing strength by one player every two minutes, until teams are down to three players. Both teams must have had possession of the ball before a result can be declared.

*In kabaddi, ties are initially broken by giving each team five raids, with various rules relaxed to encourage point-scoring. If the tie is still not broken, a &quot;golden raid&quot; is performed in which sudden death-style rules apply.
*In kho-kho, the tiebreaker is known as a &quot;Minimum Chase&quot;, wherein each team gets an additional turn to score, and the team that scores its first point faster wins.

==Longest games==
===American football===
*Six National Football League playoff games have gone into double overtime, the longest being an AFC divisional playoff game on December 25, 1971. The Miami Dolphins defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 at 7:40 into double overtime (at 82:40 of total play, the longest game in NFL history). Garo Yepremian kicked a walk-off field goal to win it. The length of the game, coupled with the fact that it was played on Christmas Day, led to a great deal of controversy and the league placed an 18-year moratorium on Christmas games. The most recent NFL game came in an AFC divisional playoff game on 12 January 2013, with the Baltimore Ravens beating the Denver Broncos 38–35 on a field goal at 1:42 of double overtime. Justin Tucker kicked a walk-off field goal to win it.
*In the former American Football League, the championship game played on 23 December 1962, the Dallas Texans defeated the Houston Oilers 20–17 on a 25-yard field goal at 2:54 into double overtime. (This game, along with all other AFL games, was incorporated into the NFL record books following the 1970 merger of the two leagues.)
*The former United States Football League had a triple-overtime playoff game on 30 June 1984, with the Los Angeles Express defeating the Michigan Panthers 27–21 on a walk-off touchdown 3:33 of triple overtime. At 93:33 of total play, this is the longest professional football game ever played in the United States.
*Collegiate (NCAA Division I FBS, formerly Division I-A): Six games have gone to seven overtimes, and one game has gone to nine overtimes:
** On 24 November 2018, Texas A&amp;M beat LSU 74–72 in a game that had been tied 31–all at end of regulation. This game directly led to the NCAA&#x27;s 2019 change in overtime rules that calls for all overtime procedures after the fourth to be played (and scored) as two-point conversion attempts, also adopted for Texas high schools because that state&#x27;s high school governing bodies base their rules on the NCAA set.
** On 23 October 2021, Illinois beat Penn State 20–18 in nine overtimes in the longest game in FBS history. This game, tied 10-all at the end of regulation, took place after a further NCAA rule change that calls for all overtime procedures after the second (instead of the fourth) to be played and scored as two-point conversion attempts. This rule change was also adopted for Texas high schools.
* Collegiate (NCAA Division I FCS, formerly Division I-AA) – 27 September 1998: Bethune-Cookman University recorded a 63–57 victory over Virginia State University, ending in eight overtimes.
* High school – 29 October 2010: Jacksonville High School (TX) beat Nacogdoches High School (TX) 84–81 after 12 OT&#x27;s. Nacogdoches could have won in earlier overtime periods, but needed a win by 8 points to keep its postseason hopes alive and so they intentionally forced additional overtime periods rather than win by fewer than 8 points (in some states which use point differential to break ties within a district, such as Kansas, teams can gain or lose only one point in a game which goes to overtime, regardless of the final margin).

===Association football===
* In the past, some football competitions also allowed successive extra time before the use of penalty shoot-outs. The final game of the 1977 Campeonato Pernambucano de Futebol, which ended with the victory of Sport Recife over Náutico, was decided in the fourth extra time of 15 minutes each, resulting in a game of 158 minutes duration.
* The 1922 Final for the German Championship between Hamburger SV and 1. FC Nürnberg had to be called off after 189 minutes at 2–2 as the coming dusk made play impossible. The rematch seven weeks later was also called off after 158 minutes at 1–1, as Nürnberg were unable to field the minimum of eight players due to injuries, with no substitutions being allowed under the rules of the time.
* The 1982 and 1985 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s soccer finals both went to the 8th (10-minute) period of extra time before being decided, lasting into the 160th and 167th minutes respectively.
*In Game 1 of the 1971 North American Soccer League playoffs semifinal (best of three series) between the Dallas Tornado and the Rochester Lancers, league scoring champion Carlos Metidieri of Rochester mercifully ended the match in the 6th overtime at the 176th minute, less than four minutes shy of playing two complete games. Seven days later in Game 3, the two teams also played a 4-OT, 148 minute match with Dallas winning this time. Incredibly, only four days after that, Dallas lost Game 1 of the NASL Championship Series in the 3rd OT to Atlanta in the 123rd minute. All totaled, Dallas played 537 minutes of football (3 minutes short of six games) in 13 days&#x27; time.

===Baseball===
*MLB – American League – 8 May 1984: Chicago White Sox beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7–6 in 25 innings. The game took 8 hours and 6 minutes to decide; play was suspended after 17 innings with the score tied 3-3 and resumed the next night. Harold Baines hit a walk-off home run to win it.
*MLB – National League – 1 May 1926: Game between the Brooklyn Robins and Boston Braves ended in a 1–all tie after 26 innings.
*MLB – By time length – 3 June 1989: Timewise, the Houston Astros beat the L.A. Dodgers 5–4 in 22 innings as Rafael Ramírez hit a walk-off single off Jeff Hamilton to end the 7-hour-14-minute contest. Bill Doran scored the winning run, and Fernando Valenzuela was playing first baseman that night.
*MLB Playoffs – 15 October 2022: The Houston Astros beat the Seattle Mariners in the longest shutout game in postseason history, 1–0 in 18 innings. The game was 6 hours, 22 minutes long. Jeremy Peña hit a solo shot to lead off the 18th, and Luis García was the winning pitcher. The 17 scoreless innings in a game set a playoff record.
*World Series – 26 October 2018: Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Boston Red Sox 3–2 in 18 innings as Max Muncy hit a walk-off solo shot off Nathan Eovaldi to end the 7-hour-20-minute contest.
*Minor league – International League – 18 April 1981: In the longest professional baseball game, with 8 hours and 25 minutes of playing time, the Pawtucket Red Sox defeated the Rochester Red Wings 3–2 in 33 innings. The game was suspended at the end of the 32nd inning at 4:09 am local time and resumed one month later. The decisive 33rd inning took just 18 minutes to play.
*Collegiate – 30 May 2009: The Texas Longhorns defeated the Boston College Eagles 3–2 in 25 innings in the Austin regional of the 2009 NCAA Division I Baseball Championship tournament.

===Camogie===

*&quot;Extra extra time&quot; was played in the 2015 Ashbourne Cup final.

===Hurling===

*A semi-final of the 2014 Ulster Senior Hurling Championship went to 30 minutes of extra time. After Down and Derry finished level (3–23 to 4-20) after the usual 20 minutes (two periods of 10 minutes&#x27; duration) of extra time, it was agreed by both teams to play another ten minutes of extra time (two periods of 5 minutes). After this, the game was still tied: 3–28 to 5–22 after 100 minutes&#x27; play.

===Ice hockey===
* Olympics — At the 2018 Winter Games, the USA defeated Canada 3–2 in a shootout in the women&#x27;s final after both teams went the entire 20-minute overtime period scoreless; Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson scored in the 6th shootout round. The men&#x27;s final at the same Olympics also went into overtime; Kirill Kaprizov, playing for the Olympic Athletes from Russia, scored at 9:40 of overtime, resulting in a 4–3 win over Germany. The overtime procedure for gold-medal games is multiple 20-minute 3-on-3 periods until one team scores come 2022.
*GET-ligaen (premier Norwegian ice hockey league) - 12 March 2017: Storhamar beat Sparta 2–1 in octuple overtime after Joakim Jensen scored the game winner at 17:14 of the 8th overtime period, for a total of 157:14 of overtime and a game length of 217:14.
*NHL – 23 March 1936: The Detroit Red Wings beat the Montreal Maroons 1–0 in sextuple overtime and after a total of 116:30 minutes had been played in overtime.
*Collegiate (NCAA Division I, men&#x27;s) – 6 March 2015: In a Hockey East men&#x27;s first round, UMass beat Notre Dame 4–3 in quintuple overtime, after 151:42 minutes of play. Yale University @ Union College &amp; Quinnipiac University @ Union College also extended 5 overtimes.
*Collegiate (NCAA Division I, women&#x27;s) – February 22, 2020: In a New England Women&#x27;s Hockey Alliance tournament semifinal, Saint Anselm defeated Franklin Pierce 2–1 at 12:36 of quintuple overtime (152:36 overall time).
*High School (Ohio High School Athletic Association)- The 2014 state championship game between Sylvania Northview (OH) and Cleveland St. Ignatius (OH) ended in a 1–1 tie after 7th (8 minute) overtime period by mutual agreement, mostly due to concerns over player safety. In response, all tournaments since 2015 allow a limit of five overtime periods, with 4-on-4 play starting on the 2nd overtime period, and a 3-player shootout commencing after all periods were played. In terms of number of periods, the 1977 North Dakota state high school hockey championship game between Grand Forks Central and Grand Forks Red River, tied 1–1 after regulation, went eight scoreless five-minute overtime periods. Officials, citing player safety concerns, stopped play after the eighth overtime and declared the teams co-champions.

===Lacrosse===
*Collegiate (NCAA Division I, men&#x27;s) – 28 March 2009: The Virginia Cavaliers team played in the longest game in the history of NCAA Division I lacrosse—a 10–9 victory over the Maryland Terrapins in seven overtime periods.

===Rugby league===
The longest rugby league game at first class level is 104 minutes, during the 1997 Super League Tri-series final between NSW and QLD. Normal game time is 80 minutes, but with scores level a further 20 minutes was played. When the scores remained level after 100 minutes, golden point extra time was invoked, a Noel Goldthorpe field goal decided the game after 104 minutes.
At a lower level, the 2015 Group 21 grand final lasted 128 minutes

===Tennis===
The Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships was a first round Men&#x27;s Singles match, in which the American 23rd seed John Isner played French qualifier Nicolas Mahut. In total, the match took 11 hours, 5 minutes of play over three days, with a final score of 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7), 7–6(3), 70–68 for a total of 183 games. It remains by far the longest match in tennis history, measured both by time and number of games. The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.

The official longest tie-break on record, 50 points, came in the first round of Wimbledon in 1985 when Michael Mortensen and Jan Gunnarson defeated John Frawley and Victor Pecci 6–4, 6–4, 3–6, 7-6 (24). Of note is an even longer tie-break of 70 points, with Benjamin Balleret defeating Guillaume Couillard 7-6 (34), 6–1. The match, held in Plantation, FL in 2013, was only a qualifying match in a Futures event, the lowest level tournament in pro tennis. All matches in qualifying are played without any chair umpire or any lines people. Without any official scorecard, this record is not official.

Since 2022, all 5th-set tiebreakers for men&#x27;s (3rd-set for women&#x27;s) are broken using the &quot;super tiebreaker&quot;, with the first to reach 10 points winning the match; this began with the Australian Open. If the tiebreaker game deciding the match is tied at 9–all (or any tie hereafter), whoever scores two straight points wins. This includes the French Open &amp; Olympics.

==Summary==
Length is in minutes unless otherwise specified.

<text>The Dodge Dynasty is a mid-size four-door sedan that was marketed by the Dodge division of Chrysler Corporation from 1988 until 1993 model years. Serving as the direct successor of the Dodge 600 sedan, the Dynasty was slotted between the Dodge Spirit and Dodge Monaco in the Dodge sedan line. 

One of the largest Chrysler K-car variants, the Dynasty used the front-wheel drive Chrysler C/AC platform, sharing its body with the 1988–1993 Chrysler New Yorker. The 1990 through 1993 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue and Chrysler Imperial share the platform with the Dynasty/New Yorker, but use an extended-wheelbase chassis, denoted the Chrysler Y platform (the longest-wheelbase sedan variant of the K-car). 

Chrysler assembled the Dodge Dynasty at its Belvidere Assembly Plant facility (Belvidere, Illinois) alongside the Chrysler New Yorker, New Yorker Fifth Avenue, and Imperial. The final vehicle was produced on May 28, 1993. For the 1993 model year, Dodge introduced the Dodge Intrepid as its largest sedan line, replacing both the Dynasty and the Monaco. 

==History==
Although it was fairly popular, the Lee Iacocca-dictated styling was boxy and conservative compared to more aerodynamically styled competitors such as the Ford Taurus and the Chevrolet Lumina. When the new front-wheel-drive Chrysler Corporation C-body cars (Dynasty and New Yorker) debuted for the 1988 model year, they were the first mass-produced cars in the world to have a fully multiplexed, fiber-optic wiring buss connecting all electronic accessories and controllers, which greatly reduced the amount and weight of wiring harnesses in the car.

==Specifications==
A 2.5 L inline-4 Chrysler engine (base model only), a Mitsubishi-sourced 3.0 L V6, the 6G72 engine, and a Chrysler-built 3.3 L V6 were available. The 3.0 engine is a non-interference engine. The 3.3 L V6 was not available until 1990. 

The four-cylinder came equipped with a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission (the A413), as did the 3.0 L in 1988. The 1988 3.0 L V6 models with TorqueFlite transmission were rated at 18 city / 24 highway MPG. The 1989-1990 Ultradrive-equipped models came with a 2.36:1 axle ratio, which was revised to 2.52:1 for 1991 to 1993. EPA mileage ratings were 21 city/25 highway MPG with the four-cylinder and three-speed TorqueFlite transmission. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG.

The new electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission, known as the Ultradrive or A604 (List of Chrysler transmissions), debuted in 1989, and became the sole transmission for V6 models through the 1993 final production year of the Dynasty. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG. The new 3.3 L V6 engine for 1990, with the Ultradrive transmission, was rated at 19 city/ 26 highway MPG. 

==Features==

The Dynasty was offered in &quot;Base&quot; (1988-1993), &quot;Premium&quot; (1988 only), &quot;LE&quot; (1988-1993), and &quot;Brougham&quot; trim levels, the latter offered on LE models, adding a padded &quot;landau&quot; vinyl roof (1992-1993).

Most Dynasty models were equipped with V6 engines, and four-cylinder engines were marketed to fleets. All were equipped with a driver&#x27;s side airbag starting in 1990. A Bendix anti-lock braking system (including 4-wheel disc brakes) (note 2 anti-lock systems were used on C/AC cars Bendix &amp; bosch) was available on V6 models during those years as well. The 1993 models featured a stainless steel exhaust system and a tamper-proof odometer.

The 1988 LE models featured rear headrests, which were deleted for 1989-1993. Early production models (1988-1990) featured standard cornering lamps and a remote fuel door release even on base trim models. The base models lost cornering lamps for 1991, and the LE models lost them for 1992.

All models (1988-1993) featured power locks that automatically locked when the car&#x27;s speed exceeded 15 miles per hour. Leather seats were optional on the LE models, but very few were so equipped. Also available were load-leveling suspension, 14-inch alloy wheels, wire wheel covers, an illuminated entry system, Infinity stereo with equalizer and power antenna, power trunk pull-down, dual 6-way power seats, with memory available for driver&#x27;s seat, and power outside mirrors.

==Production==
==Canada and Mexico==
In Canada and Mexico, Chrysler marketed the model line under the Chrysler Dynasty nameplate. Chrysler of Canada replaced the Dodge 600 with the Dodge Spirit, with the Chrysler Dynasty replacing the Chrysler LeBaron GTS hatchback (and ultimately, the Dodge Diplomat, as the Dodge Monaco was not marketed in Canada).

Within the model line, the Dynasty was slotted between the LeBaron sedan and the New Yorker. Largely identical to the base-trim Chrysler New Yorker Salon introduced in 1990, the Chrysler Dynasty featured a unique grille. In Canada, four-cylinder and V6 engines were offered; only V6 engines were offered in Mexico.

<text>The Indian National Satellite System or INSAT, is a series of multipurpose geostationary satellites launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to satisfy telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search and rescue operations. Commissioned in 1983, INSAT is the largest domestic communication system in the Indo-Pacific Region. It is a joint venture of the Department of Space, Department of Telecommunications, India Meteorological Department, All India Radio and Doordarshan. The overall coordination and management of INSAT system rests with the Secretary-level INSAT Coordination Committee.

INSAT satellites provide transponders in various bands to serve the television and communication needs of India. Some of the satellites also have the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR), CCD cameras for meteorological imaging. The satellites also incorporate transponder(s) for receiving distress alert signals for search and rescue missions in the South Asian and Indian Ocean Region, as ISRO is a member of the Cospas-Sarsat program.

==INSAT system==

The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system was commissioned with the launch of INSAT-1B in August 1983 (INSAT-1A, the first satellite was launched in April 1982 but could not fulfil the mission). INSAT system ushered in a revolution in India&#x27;s television and radio broadcasting, telecommunications and meteorological sectors. It enabled the rapid expansion of TV and modern telecommunication facilities to even the remote areas and off-shore islands. Together, the system provides transponders in C, Extended C and Ku bands for a variety of communication services. Some of the INSATs also carry instruments for meteorological observation and data relay for providing meteorological services. KALPANA-1 is an exclusive meteorological satellite. The satellites are monitored and controlled by Master Control Facilities that exist in Hassan and Bhopal.

== List of INSAT Satellite ==
This is a total list of INSAT satellites with their outcome.

It was launched in March 2007 by the European Ariane launch vehicle. Configured with payloads identical to that of INSAT-4A, INSAT-4B carries 12 Ku band and 12 C-band transponders to provide EIRP of 52 dBW and 39 dBW respectively. Two Tx/Rx dual grid offset fed shaped beam reflectors of 2.2 m diameter for Ku band and 2 m diameter for C-band are used. INSAT-4B augments the high power transponder capacity over India in Ku band and over a wider region in C-band. It is co-located with INSAT-3A at 93.5 degree E longitude.

The national space agency Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has allotted nearly seven Ku band transponders to Sun Direct; a DTH service provider from South India, and the other five to Doordarshan&#x27;s DD Direct Plus. 12 transponders in the C band are for TV, radio and telecommunication purposes.

The satellite was decommissioned on 24 January 2022. The satellite was moved to a disposal orbit, 340 km above geostationary orbit.

===== China-Stuxnet Connection =====

American cyber warfare expert Jeffrey Carr, who specialises in investigations of cyber attacks against government, mentioned in his interview with The Times of India, that the reason for this power glitch may have been an infection by the sophisticated Stuxnet worm. He attributed the development of Stuxnet worm most likely to Government of China which had the necessary sophistication to develop the bug and would gain the maximum by failure of Indian satellite. He also pointed out that Stuxnet was discovered just a month before the Indian satellite was hit by the power glitch, the reason for which still remains unknown. ISRO uses the same Siemens software that was targeted by Stuxnet.

====INSAT-4CR====

INSAT-4CR was launched on 2 September 2007 by GSLV-F04. It is a replacement satellite of INSAT-4C which was lost when GSLV-F02 failed and had to be destroyed on its course. It carries 12 Ku band 36 MHz bandwidth transponders employing 140 W TWTAs to provide an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power of 51.5 dBW at Edge of Coverage with footprint covering Indian mainland. It also incorporates a Ku band Beacon as an aid to tracking the satellite.

On 8 September 2007 ISRO reported the satellite had reached a near geosynchronous orbit, and would be stabilized in its intended orbital position of 74 degrees E longitude by 15 September. The satellite is designed for a mission life in of ten years. There were reports that the mission life of the satellite had decreased by five years as the thrusters had to burn this much fuel to restore the satellite to its correct orbit. However, the ISRO later refuted this claim dismissing it as false.

=== GSAT Series ===
The GSAT satellites are India&#x27;s indigenously developed communications satellites, used for digital audio, data and video broadcasting for both military and civilian users. As of November 2018, 19 GSAT satellites of ISRO have been launched out of which 15 satellites are currently in service.

<text>The Dodge Lancer is an automobile that was marketed in three unrelated versions by Dodge during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s. The first version debuted as a hardtop version of the full-sized 1955 Dodge, and was produced in that form until 1959. The second version revived the nameplate in 1961 for a Chrysler A platform-based compact that was marketed for two model years and replaced by the Dodge Dart. The third version returned the Lancer nameplate in 1985 for a front-wheel drive mid-sized Chrysler H platform model that was in production until 1988 after which it was replaced by the Dodge Spirit.


==1955–1959: Coronet Lancer, Royal Lancer and Custom Royal Lancer==
Dodge used the Lancer name from 1955 until 1959 to designate the two- and four-door hardtop (no B-pillar) models in the full-sized Coronet, Royal, and Custom Royal lines. The Custom Royal Lancer was a hardtop only and top-of-the-line model for Dodge in 1959. There were 6,278 two-door and 5,019 four-door hardtops made in 1959. A total of 11,397 Custom Royal Lancers were built.

The Custom Royal Lancer featured a big-block V8 engine, the producing . A D-500 option was available, which included a engine with a single Carter four-barrel carburetor rated at , as well as a Super D-500 version with dual four-barrel carburetors producing .

The Custom Royal Lancer featured a padded dashboard and steering wheel, Lancer emblems on the fenders, steering wheel, hubcaps, foot-operated windshield wipers, dual-radio antennas, deluxe side trim, and thick chrome eyebrows. Optional equipment included power windows and brakes, air conditioning, and swivel seats. The Lancer designation was dropped for 1960.
==1961–1962: Lancer==
For the 1961 model year, Dodge applied the Lancer nameplate to a higher-priced, upmarket badge-engineered version of Chrysler&#x27;s Valiant compact. The model was introduced when Chrysler officially assigned the Valiant to the Plymouth division for 1961, leaving Dodge dealers without a compact car to sell. All body styles of the Valiant were also available on the Lancer: two- and four-door sedans, two-door hardtop, and a four-door wagon. After 1962, the line was renamed the Dodge Dart.

A survey of 1961 Lancer owners by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; based on a total of miles driven reported that 77.6.2% rated their cars as excellent with handling, comfortable ride, power/performance, and styling as their top likes.

===Styling &amp; trim===

The Lancer wheelbase and body shell were identical to those of the Valiant, but interior and exterior trim were more upscale for the Lancer. Lancers featured round taillights and a full-width grille, instead of the Valiant&#x27;s cat&#x27;s-eye taillights and central grille. For 1961, trim levels were the basic &quot;170&quot; and the premium &quot;770&quot;. During 1961, the two-door hardtop was marketed as the &quot;Lancer 770 2-Door Hardtop&quot;. For the 1962 model year, the hardtop was marketed as the &quot;GT 2-Door Hardtop&quot; and carried premium trim. Two-tone paint was available and instead of the front bench seat, there were two bucket seats. Also for the 1962 model, &quot;Lancer GT&quot; medallions were mounted on the doors&#x27; interior trim panels below the vent window and on the sides of the front fenders just aft of the headlamps. &quot;GT&quot; emblems were placed on the hood, the deck lid, and on the vinyl dash pad. The headlamp bezels and the grille&#x27;s horizontal slats were blacked-out. The GT also lacked certain ornamentation found on the 170s and 770s such as the &quot;Lancer&quot; door scripts, the slanted chrome hash marks on the lower quarter panel, and the hook-ended stainless steel door-to-fender spears.

===Powertrains===
The Lancer used the slant-6 engine. The base engine was the unit, rated at . The optional power package consisted of the larger engine, rated at . After the start of the 1961 model year, a die-cast aluminum version of the 225 engine block was made available. The aluminum 225 weighed less than the iron 170 and less than the iron 225. Any of the available engines could be equipped at the dealer with Chrysler&#x27;s Hyper Pak parts kit for a significant power upgrade: the 170 Hyper Pak&#x27;s published output was , while the 225 Hyper Pak&#x27;s was . The Hyper-Pak shaved more than four seconds off the 0 to time versus the standard 225, and was over a second quicker and seven miles per hour faster in the quarter mile. With the Hyper Pak, a 225 Lancer could go from 0 to in 8.6 seconds and turn in a standing quarter-mile time of 16.4 seconds. 1962 cars had the engine and transmission moved for a flatter front floor.

Transmission options were a Chrysler-built A903 three-speed manual with the shifter on the floor in 1961 and on the steering column in 1962, or a pushbutton-operated A904 Torqueflite three-speed automatic.

===Drag strip &amp; sales competition===
In the 1962 NHRA Winternationals, Wayne Weihe won the C/FX (Factory Experimental) class with a Hyper-Pak-equipped Lancer, clocking a 15.67 E.T. Although the bigger Dodges were beginning to appear at drag strips around the country, the &quot;Golden Lancer&quot; of Dode Martin and Jim Nelson was one of the fastest compacts on the strips in 1962. The engine was a Chrysler RB V8 engine modified by the Chrysler engineers&#x27; &quot;Ramchargers&quot; racing team. The Golden Lancer raced successfully in A/FX class and could do the quarter-mile in 12.68 seconds at .

Lancer sales did not meet expectations and sold about half as well as the Valiant. As a late part of the total redesign of Dodge&#x27;s compact car for 1963, the Lancer name was discontinued. Dodge compacts for 1963 through 1976 were named Dart, a name that had previously been assigned to a larger car produced by Dodge from 1960 through 1962.

===South African market===
In South Africa, a right hand drive version of the Lancer was sold from 1961 through 1963, badged as the DeSoto Rebel not long after the DeSoto name was discontinued in the U.S. All were equipped with the Slant 6 engine, and most had the three-speed manual transmission. As with the Australian RV1 and SV1 Valiants, the DeSoto Rebel used the instrument cluster from the U.S. 1961 Plymouth Valiant. White reflectors were mounted to the front bumper, in compliance with South African vehicle equipment regulations.
The Rebel name was re-introduced by Chrysler South Africa in 1967 as the economy-priced &quot;Valiant Rebel&quot;.

==1985–1989: Lancer==
The Dodge Lancer was re-introduced in 1985 as a mid-sized 5-door hatchback. It was a rebadged version of the Chrysler LeBaron GTS and was based on the Chrysler H platform, a stretched version of the Chrysler K platform. The Lancer eventually slotted between the Aries and the 600. All Lancers were built in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Production ended on April 7, 1989, and the market position was replaced by the Spirit.

===Lancer Shelby===

A special version was available for the 1987 model year called the Shelby Lancer, which was built by Shelby Automobiles in Whittier, California. A total of 800 units were produced with half featuring a 5-speed manual transmission and cloth seats while the other half were equipped with a 3-speed automatic transmission and leather upholstery. 

Along with Shelby-themed trim changes, the cars included modified suspension, with upgraded sway bars, shorter springs, and quicker steering, as well as 4-wheel disc brakes and a Pioneer CD player which were an advanced features for the time. The Lancer Shelby is powered by a 2.2 L Turbo I engine converted to Turbo II specifications with an intercooler, producing and of torque. Period 0-60 mph (97 km/h) tests achieved between 7.2 and 8.0 seconds.

=== Dodge Lancer Shelby ===
Chrysler took over production starting with the 1988 model year, building them in the same Sterling Heights plant as regular Lancers.
The &quot;Dodge Lancer Shelby&quot; featured many of the same appearance and handling modifications as the Shelby, with some omissions. These included the upgraded sway bars, shorter springs, and quicker steering along with other comfort and convenience features such as leather seats, power locks, windows, seats and mirrors, a tilt steering wheel, and a two-position cup holder. While some of the modifications from the 1987 Shelbys were included, the Shelby shocks and wheels were replaced by Chrysler units and the rear disk brakes were discontinued in favor of the regular Lancer&#x27;s rear drums. Most of the Shelby graphics and badges were also removed and the Pioneer CD player was replaced by Chrysler&#x27;s Infinity II system. While the 1987 models were only available in red, the 1988 and 1989 models added a choice of white or black. 

The Lancer Shelby used a true intercooled Turbo II engine for the manual transmission version, providing the same and of torque. The automatic variant was equipped with the Turbo I. 279 Lancer Shelbys were produced in 1988 and 208 in 1989 for a total of 487 units.

===European market===
In April 1988, Chrysler started offering some models on the European market. One of them was the &quot;Chrysler GTS&quot;, a rebadged version of the Dodge Lancer ES. Due to European vehicle regulations, the exterior appearance was slightly different. The rear turn signals were amber rather than red, the front sidemarkers and the centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL) were blanked off, small round repeaters were installed into the front fenders and the sideview mirrors were of spring-hinged rather than rigid design. The engine options included the naturally aspirated Four, and a turbocharged version of the same engine. From 1989 on, the Four became available with or without a turbocharger. The 2.2 engine was dropped, except for the Turbo II version that was standard equipment on the Chrysler GTS Shelby, the European sibling of the Dodge Lancer Shelby. A five-speed manual gearbox was standard, with a three-speed automatic transmission as an extra-cost option. The GTS Shelby came only with a manual transmission.

The Chrysler GTS had few buyers in Europe; the competition was too hard. Even the comparatively low prices could not help, and sales figures were very low. By the end of 1989, the GTS was replaced by the Saratoga.

<doc id="633248" wikidata="Q5719132" url="?curid=633248" title="Henry Callahan">
<text>Henry Callahan (1957–1982) was a player and ambassador of Ultimate and helped bring the sport to the University of Oregon, formally establishing a team in 1978. In 1982, he was murdered during a robbery while working in Boulder, Colorado. Both the Callahan Award, given each year to the best male and female college Ultimate players and the Callahan Rules of Ultimate are named after him. The idea and the award were founded by Charles Kerr, a long-time coach. 

There is also a move in Ultimate named after Callahan called a &quot;Callahan&quot;. A &quot;Callahan&quot; is when a &quot;defensive&quot; player intercepts the disc in the opponent&#x27;s end zone for a point. It is a rare occurrence, because it requires a defender to intercept, rather than simply block, a pass in the offense&#x27;s own end zone. Under normal circumstances, the offense does not start a possession within their own end zone, so opportunities for a Callahan are limited to situations where the offense has been forced into their own end zone (either by a good pull or defensive pressure) or backward passes near the end zone. The move is so called because it was first legalized as a goal (rather than needing to be put into play from the goal line) in the Callahan version of the rules, which differed from the Ultimate Player Association&#x27;s current rules at the time. The rules were subsequently changed in both the UPA (now USA Ultimate) and the World Flying Disc Federation to make a Callahan a legal goal under all rule sets used for Ultimate. 

Henry Callahan was also a disc golf player and his family donated money to install a memorial disc golf course at Bevier Park in Waukegan, Illinois. Completed in 1992 and expanded in 2008, this course is located in Henry Callahan Memorial Park.

<doc id="633249" wikidata="Q2662383" url="?curid=633249" title="Hank Thompson (baseball)">
<text>Henry Curtis Thompson (December 8, 1925 – September 30, 1969) was an American player in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball who played primarily as a third baseman. A left-handed batter, he played with the Dallas Green Monarchs (1941), Kansas City Monarchs (1943, 1946–47, 1948), St. Louis Browns (1947) and New York Giants (1949–56).

== Early life ==

Thompson was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

=== Negro leagues ===

At the beginning of his career, he was a hard-hitting star for the Monarchs in the Negro American League, playing both infield and outfield. At 17, he played right field in his first season, batting .300.

=== World War II ===

The following year he was drafted into the Army. Thompson was a machine gunner with the 1695th Combat Engineers at the historic Battle of the Bulge. A few years later, he was nicknamed &quot;Ametralladora&quot; (Spanish for &quot;machine gun&quot;) by Cuban fans while playing in the Cuban Winter League.

Sergeant Thompson was discharged on June 20, 1946, and immediately returned to the Monarchs, who were in the midst of capturing the league title. With the start of the major league 1947 season, history was made when Jackie Robinson broke the color line with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

== Major League debut ==
Thompson played his first game with the Browns on July 17, 1947, integrating the Browns&#x27; lineup two days before Willard Brown made his debut as the second black player on the Browns. The following day, July 20, Thompson played second base and Brown played center field for the Browns in a game against the Boston Red Sox. That game marked the first time that two black players appeared in the same major league lineup. Later, in an August 9 doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians, Thompson and Indians outfielder Larry Doby became the first black players of opposing teams to appear on the field at the same time. Thompson was with the Browns a little over a month and hit only .256 in 27 games, mainly at second base. On August 23 he was released, and he rejoined the Monarchs through the 1948 season. Thompson batted .375 in his last year with Kansas City, finishing third in the batting race and leading the league in steals with 20.

== New York Giants ==

On July 4, 1949, the New York Giants called Thompson up from the Giants’ Jersey City farm club. He received $2,500 over the league minimum of $5,000. By signing with the Giants, Thompson earned a unique place in the baseball history. He was the first black baseball player to play in both the National and American leagues. Subsequently, he repeated the same &quot;first&quot; many times. On July 8, 1949, Thompson and Monte Irvin became the first black players for the Giants. Thus Thompson became the only player to participate in breaking the segregation barrier on two different teams. Another first occurred when Thompson batted against Dodgers pitcher Don Newcombe in the same season, becoming the first black batter to face a black pitcher in the majors. And in 1951, after playing a strong role in the Giants&#x27; drive to the pennant, Thompson and Irvin teamed with Willie Mays in the World Series to form the first all-black outfield in the majors. However, for the remainder of his career he played mostly at third base.

On August 16, 1950, Hank Thompson became the first player since 1939 to hit two inside-the-park home runs in one game, a feat which would not be duplicated again until 1972. He enjoyed his best season in 1953, when he batted .302 with 24 home runs, 74 runs batted in and a .567 slugging average. In 1954 he hit 26 homers and drove 86 runs, belted three homers in one game, and in the World Series batted .364 and drew a four-game Series record of seven walks against Cleveland.

In his 9-year career Thompson batted .267, with 129 home runs, 482 runs batted in, 492 runs scored, 801 hits, 104 doubles, 34 triples, 33 stolen bases, 493 walks for a .372 on-base percentage and 1,360 total bases for a .453 slugging average. In 1957 his contract was sold to the minor league Minneapolis Millers of the American Association, where he finished his career.

== Post-baseball struggles and death ==

After leaving baseball, Thompson met with a series of difficulties. He became a cab driver in New York, but following a divorce was convicted of armed robbery in Texas, and in 1963 was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In 1967, however, he was paroled after serving three years; in 1968 he moved to Fresno, California, and became a city playground director. In the summer of 1969 he left that position, possibly to seek a job with the National League; but those plans did not have a chance to materialize. Thompson died at the age of 43 following a seizure on September 30, 1969, 13 years to the day of his last game in the majors.

<doc id="633252" wikidata="Q152553" url="?curid=633252" title="Colchicum autumnale">
<text>Colchicum autumnale, commonly known as autumn crocus, meadow saffron, naked boys or naked ladies, is a toxic autumn-blooming flowering plant that resembles the true crocuses, but is a member of the plant family Colchicaceae, unlike the true crocuses, which belong to the family Iridaceae. It is called &quot;naked boys/ladies&quot; because the flowers emerge from the ground long before the leaves appear. Despite the vernacular name of &quot;meadow saffron&quot;, this plant is not the source of saffron, which is obtained from the saffron crocus, &quot;Crocus sativus&quot; – and that plant, too, is sometimes called &quot;autumn crocus&quot;.

The species is cultivated as an ornamental in temperate areas, in spite of its toxicity. The cultivar &#x27;Nancy Lindsay&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Description==
This herbaceous perennial has leaves up to long. The flowers are solitary, across, with six tepals and six stamens with orange anthers and three white styles. At the time of fertilisation, the ovary is below ground. 

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;C. autumnale&quot; is the only species of its family native to Great Britain and Ireland, with notable populations under the stewardship of the County Wildlife Trusts. It also occurs across mainland Europe from Portugal to Ukraine, and is reportedly naturalised in Sweden, European Russia, and New Zealand. It grows in lowland grassy meadows.

==Pharmaceutical uses==
The bulb-like corms of &quot;C. autumnale&quot; contain colchicine, a useful drug with a narrow therapeutic index. Colchicine is approved in many countries for the treatment of gout and familial Mediterranean fever. Colchicine is also used in plant breeding to produce polyploid strains.

==Toxicity==
&quot;Colchicum&quot; is lethally toxic due to its colchicine content and the leaves have been mistaken by foragers for those of &quot;Allium ursinum&quot; (ramsons or wild garlic), which they vaguely resemble.

This plant (and colchicine itself) poses a particular threat to felines. The corms of meadow saffron contain the highest level of toxins, but all parts of the plant are regarded as poisonous.

<doc id="633253" wikidata="Q200918" url="?curid=633253" title="Wayne C. Booth">
<text>Wayne Clayson Booth (February 22, 1921, in American Fork, Utah – October 10, 2005, in Chicago, Illinois) was an American literary critic and rhetorician. He was the George M. Pullman Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in English Language &amp; Literature and the College at the University of Chicago. His work followed largely from the Chicago school of literary criticism.

==Life==
Booth was born in Utah of Latter-day Saint parents, Wayne Chipman Booth and Lillian Clayson Booth. The older Booth died in 1927, when young Wayne was six years old. Booth graduated from American Fork High School in 1938. He was educated at Brigham Young University and the University of Chicago. He taught English at Haverford College and Earlham College before moving back to the University of Chicago. He maintained his membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout his life, but took the position that many religions were equally acceptable and sufficient. He was a member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==&quot;The Rhetoric of Fiction&quot;==
In what was likely Booth&#x27;s most-recognized book, &quot;The Rhetoric of Fiction&quot;, he argued that all narrative is a form of rhetoric.

The book can be seen as his critique of those he viewed as mainstream critics. Booth argues that beginning roughly with Henry James, critics began to emphasize the difference between &quot;showing&quot; and &quot;telling&quot; in fiction and have placed more and more of a dogmatic premium on &quot;showing.&quot;

Booth argued that despite the realistic effects that modern authors have achieved, trying to distinguish narratives in this way is simplistic and deeply flawed, because authors invariably both show and tell. Booth observed that they appear to choose between the techniques based upon decisions about how to convey their various &quot;commitments&quot; along various &quot;lines of interest,&quot; that is, rhetorical means of persuading the audience.

Booth&#x27;s criticism can be viewed as distinct from traditional biographical criticism (still practiced, especially among popular critics), the new criticism that argued that one can talk only about what the text says, and the modern criticism that argues for the &quot;eradication&quot; of authorial presence. Booth claimed that it is impossible to talk about a text without talking about an author, because the existence of the text implies the existence of an author.

Booth argued not only that it does not matter whether an author—as distinct from the narrator—intrudes directly in a work, since readers will always infer the existence of an author behind any text they encounter, but also that readers always draw conclusions about the beliefs and judgments (and also, conclusions about the skills and &quot;success&quot;) of a text&#x27;s implied author, along the text&#x27;s various lines of interest:However impersonal he may try to be, his readers will inevitably construct a picture of the official scribe who writes in this manner -- and of course that official scribe will never be neutral toward all values. Our reaction to his various commitments, secret or overt, will help to determine our response to the work.This implied author (a widely used term that Booth coined in this book; whom he also called an author&#x27;s &quot;second self&quot;) is the one who &quot;chooses, consciously or unconsciously, what we read; we infer him as an ideal, literary, created version of the real man; he is the sum of his own choices.&quot;

In &quot;The Rhetoric of Fiction&quot; Booth coined the term &quot;unreliable narrator&quot;.

Booth also spent several chapters—which include numerous references to and citations from widely recognized works of fiction—describing the various effects that implied authors achieve along the various lines of interest that he identifies, and the pitfalls they fall into, depending upon whether the implied author provides commentary, and upon the degree to which a story&#x27;s narrator is reliable or unreliable, personal or impersonal.

Booth detailed three &quot;Types of Literary Interest&quot; that are &quot;available for technical manipulation in fiction&quot;:(1) Intellectual or cognitive: We have, or can be made to have, strong intellectual curiosity about &quot;the facts,&quot; the true interpretation, the true reasons, the true origins, the true motives, or the truth about life itself. (2) Qualitative: We have, or can be made to have, a strong desire to see any pattern or form completed, or to experience a further development of qualities of any kind. We might call this kind &quot;aesthetic,&quot; if to do so did not suggest that a literary form using this interest was necessarily of more artistic value than one based on other interests. (3) Practical: We have, or can be made to have, a strong desire for the success or failure of those we love or hate, admire or detest; or we can be made to hope for or fear a change in the quality of a character. We might call this kind &quot;human,&quot; if to do so did not imply that 1 and 2 were somehow less than human.In the 1983 edition of &quot;The Rhetoric of Fiction&quot;, which included a lengthy addendum to the original 1961 edition, Booth outlined various identities taken on by both authors and readers: The Flesh-and Blood Author, the Implied Author, the Teller of This Tale, the Career Author, and the &quot;Public Myth&quot;; and, the Flesh-and-Blood Re-Creator of Many Stories, the Postulated Reader, the Credulous Listener, the Career Reader, and the Public Myth about the &quot;Reading Public.&quot;

==Other works==
A later work is &quot;Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent&quot;, in which Booth defines rhetoric as the art of finding warrantable beliefs. Booth addresses the question of what circumstances should cause one to change one&#x27;s mind, discussing what happens in situations where two diametrically opposed systems of belief are in argument. His central example is an incident at the University of Chicago, when some students and administrators were engaged in fierce debate that eventually degenerated into each side simply reprinting the other side&#x27;s arguments without comment, believing that the opposing side was so self-evidently absurd that to state its propositions was to refute them.

Another book of note is 1974&#x27;s &quot;A Rhetoric of Irony&quot;, in which Booth examines the long tradition of irony and its use in literature. It is probably his second most popular work after &quot;The Rhetoric of Fiction&quot;. 

In &quot;The Company We Keep: An Ethics of Fiction&quot; (1988)&quot;,&quot; Booth returns to the topic of rhetorical effects in fiction, and &quot;argues for the relocation of ethics to the center of our engagement with literature&quot; (cover note, &quot;The Company we Keep&quot;). It is a widely cited contribution to the field of literature and ethics or ethical criticism, building on his arguments in &quot;Critical Understanding&quot; (1979).

The University of Chicago Wayne C. Booth Graduate Student Prize for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching was established in 1991 in honor of Booth. The award is given out annually.

Additionally, Booth House within the University of Chicago College Housing is named in honor of Booth.

<doc id="633263" wikidata="Q17157420" url="?curid=633263" title="Radiotelephony procedure">
<text>Radiotelephony procedure (also on-air protocol and voice procedure) includes various techniques used to clarify, simplify and standardize spoken communications over two-way radios, in use by the armed forces, in civil aviation, police and fire dispatching systems, citizens&#x27; band radio (CB), and amateur radio.

Voice procedure communications are intended to maximize clarity of spoken communication and reduce errors in the verbal message by use of an accepted nomenclature. It consists of a signalling protocol such as the use of abbreviated codes like the CB radio ten-code, Q codes in amateur radio and aviation, police codes, etc., and jargon.

Some elements of voice procedure are understood across many applications, but significant variations exist. The armed forces of the NATO countries have similar procedures in order to make cooperation easier.

The impacts of having radio operators who are not well-trained in standard procedures can cause significant operational problems and delays, as exemplified by one case of amateur radio operators during Hurricane Katrina, in which:...many of the operators who were deployed had excellent go-kits and technical ability, but were seriously wanting in traffic handling skill. In one case it took almost 15 minutes to pass one 25 word message.

== Introduction ==
Radiotelephony procedures encompass international regulations, official procedures, technical standards, and commonly understood conventions intended to ensure efficient, reliable, and inter-operable communications via all modes of radio communications. The most well-developed and public procedures are contained in the Combined Communications Electronics Board&#x27;s Allied Communications Procedure ACP 125(G): &quot;Communications Instructions Radiotelephone Procedures&quot;.

These procedures consist of many different components. The three most important ones are:
# Voice procedures—what to say
# Speech technique—how to say it
# Microphone technique—how to say it into a microphone
These procedures have been developed, tested under the most difficult of conditions, then revised to implement the lessons learned, many times since the early 1900s. According to ACP 125(G) and the Virginia Defense Force Signal Operating Instructions:Voice procedure is designed to provide the fastest and most accurate method of speech transmission. All messages should be pre-planned, brief and straightforward. Ideally, messages should be written down: even brief notes reduce the risk of error. Messages should be constructed clearly and logically in order not to confuse the recipient.Voice procedure is necessary because:
# Speech on a congested voice net must be clear, concise and unambiguous. To avoid interference between speech and data, it will often be expedient to assign the passage of data traffic to logistic or admin nets rather than to those directly associated with command and control.
# It must be assumed that all transmissions will be intercepted by a portion of the civilian population. The use of a standard procedure will help reduce the threat of spreading rumors or creating panic among those not involved in an emergency response.
# Some form of discipline is needed to ensure that transmissions do not overlap. If two people send traffic at the same time, the result is chaos.
Radio operators must talk differently because two-way radios reduce the quality of human speech in such a way that it becomes harder to understand. A large part of the radio-specific procedures is the specialized language that has been refined over more than 100 years.

There are several main methods of communication over radio, and they should be used in this order of preference:
# Procedure words
# Standard (predefined) phraseology (for most things in aviation and maritime use)
# Plain language dialogue (for things that can&#x27;t be handled by phraseology)
# Formal messages
# Narrative messages
# Dialogue (normal conversation)
# Brevity codes, including Ten-codes, and Phillips Code; and operating signals, including 92 code, Q code, and Z code; should be used as a last choice, as these lists of codes are so extensive that it is unlikely that all participants have the full and correct definitions memorized. All of those listed here except the ten-code are designed exclusively for use in Morse code or teletypewriter use, and are thus unsuitable for use on voice circuits.

== International Radio Regulations ==
All radio communications on the planet operate under regulations created by the ITU-R, which prescribes most of the basic voice radio procedures, and these are further codified by each individual country.

=== United States radio regulations ===
In the U.S., radio communications are regulated by the NTIA and the FCC. Regulations created by the FCC are codified in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations:
* Part 4—Disruptions to Communications
* Part 20—Commercial Mobile Services
* Part 80—Stations in the Maritime Services (Maritime Mobile Service)
* Part 87—Aviation Services
* Part 90—Private Land Mobile Radio Services (Concerning licensed wireless communications for businesses and non-federal governments)
** Subpart C—Business Band
* Part 95—Personal Radio Services (MURS, FRS, GMRS, and CB radio)
* Part 97—Amateur Radio Service (Ham radio)
* Part 300—NTIA Rules and Regulations

== Radio call signs ==
Radio call signs are a globally unique identifier assigned to all stations that are required to obtain a license in order to emit RF energy. The identifiers consist of from 3 to 9 letters and digits, and while the basic format of the call signs are specified by the ITU-R Radio Regulations, Article 19, Identification of stations, the details are left up to each country&#x27;s radio licensing organizations.

=== Official call signs ===
Each country is assigned a range of prefixes, and the radiotelecommunications agencies within each country then responsible for allocating call signs, within the format defined by the RR, as they see fit. The Radio Regulations require most radio stations to regularly identify themselves by means of their official station call sign or other unique identifier.

=== Functional designators ===
Because official radio call signs have no inherent meaning outside of the above-described patterns, and other than individually licensed Amateur radio stations, do not serve to identify the person using the radio, they are not usually desirable as the primary means of identifying which person, department, or function is transmitting or is being contacted.

For this reason, functional designators (a.k.a. tactical call signs) are frequently used to provide such identification. Such designators are not sufficient to meet the FCC requirements that stations regularly identify the license they are operating under, typically every x number of minutes and at the end of each transmission, where x ranges from 10 to 30 minutes (longer for broadcast stations).

For the some radio services, the FCC authorizes alternate station IDs, typically in situations where the alternate station ID serves the purposes of identifying the transmitting station better than the standard ITU format. These include:
* Aircraft—the registration number (tail number) of the aircraft, preceded by the type (typical of general aviation aircraft); or the aircraft operator nickname assigned by the FAA, followed by the flight number (typical of scheduled airline services).
* Land mobile—Name of the station licensee (typically abbreviated), location of station, name of city, or facility served, followed by additional digits following the more general ID.
* Land mobile railroad—Name of railroad, followed by the train number, engine number etc.

=== Call signs in the United States ===
The United States has been assigned all call signs with the prefixes K, N, and W, as well as AAA–ALZ. Allocating call signs within these groups is the responsibility of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (almost all government stations) or the Federal Communications Commission (all other stations), and they subdivide the radio call signs into the following groups:

==== Military call sign systems ====
* AAA–AEZ and ALA–ALZ are reserved for Department of the Army stations
* AFA–AKZ are assigned to the Department of the Air Force
* NAA–NZZ is jointly assigned to the Department of the Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard.

==== Amateur call sign systems ====
Ham station call signs begin with A, K, N or W, and have a single digit from 0 to 9 that separates the 1 or 2 letter prefix from the 1 to 3 letter suffix (special event stations have only three characters: the prefix, the digit, and a one-letter suffix).

==== Maritime call signs ====
Maritime call signs have a much more complex structure, and are sometimes replaced with the name of the vessel or a Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number.

== Microphone technique ==
Microphones are imperfect reproducers of the human voice, and will distort the human voice in ways that make it unintelligible unless a set of techniques are used to avoid the problems. The recommended techniques vary, but generally align with the following guidelines, which are extracted from the IARU Emergency Telecommunications Guide
* Hold the microphone close to your cheek, just off to the side of your mouth, positioned so that you talk across, and not into, the microphone. This reduces plosives (popping sounds from letters such as &quot;P&quot;).
* Speak in a normal, clear, calm voice. Talking loudly or shouting does not increase the volume of your voice at the receiving radios, but will distort the audio, because loud sounds result in over-modulation, which directly causes distortion.
* Speak at a normal pace, or preferably, slower. Not leaving gaps between words causes problems with radio transmissions that are not as noticeable when one is talking face-to-face.
* Pronounce words carefully, making each syllable and sound clearly distinguishable.
* Adjust the microphone gain so that a normal voice 50 mm away from the microphone will produce full modulation. Setting the gain higher than that will transmit greater amounts of background noise, making your voice harder to hear, or even distorted. Noise-cancelling microphones can assist in this, but do not substitute for proper mic placement and gain settings.
* If you use a headset boom microphone, be aware that lower-cost models have omni-directional elements that will pick up background noise. Models with uni-directional or noise-cancelling elements are best.
* Do not use voice operated transmission (VOX) microphone circuits for emergency communication. The first syllable or so of each transmission will not actually be transmitted, while extraneous noises may also trigger transmission unintentionally.
* If not operating in a vehicle, use a foot push-to-talk switch so that both of your hands are free to transmit.
* Always leave a little extra time (1 second will suffice) between depressing the PTT switch and speaking. Numerous electronic circuits, including tone squelch, RF squelch and power-saving modes, need a substantial fraction of that time in order to allow your signal to be transmitted or received. This is especially true of repeaters, which might also have a &quot;kerchunk&quot; timer that prevents brief transmissions from keying the transmitter, and doubly true of linked repeaters, which have multiple sets of such circuits that must be activated before all stations can hear you.
* One must also leave gaps between the last station that transmitted and the next station, because such gaps are necessary to let other stations break in with emergency traffic. A pause of two seconds, approximated by a count of &quot;one, one thousand&quot; is sufficient in many conditions.
Similarly, the U.S. military radio procedures recommend headsets with noise-cancelling microphones:Use of Audio Equipment. In many situations, particularly in noisy or difficult conditions, the use of headsets fitted with a noise cancelling microphone is preferable to loudspeakers as a headset will aid concentration and the audibility of the incoming signal. The double-sided, noise cancelling microphone is designed to cancel out surrounding noise, for example engine noise or gunfire, allowing speech entering on one side to pass freely. The microphone should be as close to the mouth as possible.The U.S. Navy radio operator training manuals contain similar guidelines, including NAVPERS 10228-B, Radioman 3 &amp; 2 training course (1957 edition):

Dos:
# Do listen before transmitting. Unauthorized break-in is lubberly and causes confusion. Often neither transmission gets through.
# Do speak clearly and distinctly. Slurred syllables and clipped speech are both hard to understand. A widespread error among untrained operators is failure to emphasize vowels sufficiently.
# Do speak slowly. Unless the action officer is listening he will have to rely on the copy being typed or written at the other end. Give the recorder a chance to get it all the first time. You will save time and repetitions that way. 
# Do avoid extremes of pitch. A high voice cuts best through interference, but is shrill and unpleasant if too high. A lower pitch is easier on the ear, but is hard to understand through background noises if too low.
# Do be natural. Maintain a normal speaking rhythm. Group words in a natural manner. Send your message phrase by phrase rather than word by word.
# Do use standard pronunciation. Speech with sectional peculiarities is difficult for persons from other parts of the country. Talkers using the almost standard pronunciation of a broadcast network announcer are easiest to understand.
# Do speak in a moderately strong voice. This will override unavoidable background noises and prevent drop-outs.
# Do keep correct distance between lips and microphone. If the distance is too great, speech is inaudible and background noises creep in; if too small, blaring and blasting result.
# Do shield your microphone. Turn your head away from noise generating sources while transmitting.
# Do keep the volume of a hand set earphone low.
# Do keep speaker volumes to a moderate level.
# Do give an accurate evaluation in response to a request for a radio check. A transmission with feedback and/or a high level of background noise is not loud and clear even though the message can be understood.
# Do pause momentarily, when possible, and interrupt your carrier. This allows any other station with higher precedence traffic to break in.
# Do adhere strictly to prescribed procedures. Up-to-date radiotelephone procedure is found in the effective edition of ACP 125.
# Do transact your business and get off the air. Preliminary calls only waste time when communication is good and the message short. It is NOT necessary to blow into a microphone to test it, nor to repeat portions of messages when no repetition has been requested.
Do Nots:
# Don&#x27;t transmit while surrounded by other persons loudly discussing the next maneuver or event. It confuses receiving stations, and a serious security violation can result.
# Don&#x27;t hold the microphone button in the push-to-talk position until absolutely ready to transmit. Your carrier will block communications on the net.
# Don&#x27;t hold a hand set in such a position while speaking that there is a possibility of having feedback from the earphone added to other extraneous noises.
# Don&#x27;t hold a hand set loosely. A firm pressure on the microphone button prevents unintentional release and consequent signal drop-out.
# Don&#x27;t send test signals for longer than 10 seconds.
Many radio systems also require the operator to wait a few seconds after depressing the PTT button before speaking, and so this is a recommended practice on all systems. The California Statewide EMS Operations and Communications Resource Manual explains why:Key your transmitter before engaging in speech. The complexities in communications system design often introduce delay in the time it takes to turn on the various components comprising the system. Transmitters take time to come up to full power output, tone squelch decoding equipment requires time to open receivers and receiver voting systems take time to select the best receiver. While these events generally are accomplished in less than one second&#x27;s time, there are many voice transmissions that could be missed in their entirety if the operator did not delay slightly before beginning his/her voice message. Pausing one second after depressing the push-to-talk button on the microphone or handset is sufficient in most cases to prevent missed words or responses.Further, transmissions should be kept as short as possible; a maximum limit of 20 or 30 seconds is typically suggested:Transmissions should generally be kept to less than 20 seconds, or within the time specifically allocated by the system. Most radio systems limit transmissions to less than 30 seconds to prevent malfunctioning transmitters or accidentally keyed microphones from dominating a system, and will automatically stop transmitting at the expiration of the allowed time cutting off additional audio.

== Speech technique ==
Communicating by voice over two-way radios is more difficult than talking with other people face-to-face or over the telephone. The human voice is changed dramatically by two-way radio circuits. In addition to cutting off important audio bandwidth at both the low and high ends of the human speech spectrum (reducing the bandwidth by at least half), other distortions of the voice occur in the microphone, transmitter, receiver, and speaker—and the radio signal itself is subject to fading, interruptions, and other interference. All of these make human speech more difficult to recognize; in particular, momentary disruptions or distortions of the signal are likely to block the transmission of entire syllables.

The best way to overcome these problems is by greatly reducing the number of single-syllable words used. This is very much counter to the human nature of taking shortcuts, and so takes training, discipline, and having all operators using the same language, techniques, and procedures.

=== Method of speech ===

Several radio operation procedures manuals, including ACP 125(G) teach the same mnemonic of Rhythm, Speed, Volume, and Pitch (RSVP):
; Rhythm: Use short sentences divided into sensible phrases which maintain a natural rhythm; they should not be spoken word by word. Where pauses occur, the press-to-talk should be released to minimize transmission time and permit stations to break in when necessary.
; Speed: Speak slightly slower than for normal conversation. Where a message is to be written down by the recipients, or in difficult conditions, extra time should be allowed to compensate for the receiving station experiencing the worst conditions. Speed of transmission is easily adjusted by increasing or decreasing the length of pauses between phrases, as opposed to altering the gaps between words; the latter will create an unnatural, halted style of speech, which is difficult to understand.
; Volume: Speak quietly when using whisper facilities, otherwise the volume should be as for normal conversation. Shouting causes distortion.
; Pitch: The voice should be pitched slightly higher than for normal conversation to improve clarity.
According to the UK&#x27;s Radiotelephony Manual, CAP 413, radio operators should talk at a speed of fewer than 100 words per minute.

== Radio discipline ==
Communicating over a half-duplex, shared circuit with multiple parties requires a large amount of discipline in following the established procedures and conventions, because whenever one particular radio operator is transmitting, that operator can not hear any other station on the channel being used.

=== ABC—Accuracy, Brevity, Clarity ===
The initialism ABC is commonly used as a memory aid to reinforce the three most important rules about what to transmit.

=== The Five Ws ===

Whenever a report or a request is transmitted over a two-way radio, the operator should consider including the standard Five Ws in the transmission, so as to eliminate additional requests for information that may occur and thereby delay the request (and other communications).
# Who—needs something
# What—do they need
# Why—do they need it
# When—do they need it
# Where—do they need it

=== Other rules ===
* Think before you speak
* Listen before you speak
* Answer all calls promptly
* Keep the airways free of unnecessary talk
* Be brief and to the point
* Only transmit facts
* Do not act as a relay station unless the net control asks for one

== Voice procedures ==
The procedures described in this section can be viewed as the base of all voice radio communications procedures.

=== Service-specific procedures ===
However, the international aviation and maritime industries, because their global expansion in the 20th century coincided with, and were heavily integral to the development of voice procedures and other aspects in the development of two-way radio technology, gradually developed their own variations on these procedures.

==== Aeronautical Mobile Service ====

Voice communications procedures for international air traffic control and communications among airplanes are defined by the following International Civil Aviation Organization documents:
* Annex 10—&quot;Aeronautical Telecommunications&quot;, Volume II—&quot;Communications Procedures including those with PANS status&quot;,
* &quot;Procedures for Air Navigation Services—Air Traffic Management&quot; (PANS-ATM, ICAO Doc 4444)
* ICAO Doc 9432 (AN/925) &quot;Manual of Radiotelephony&quot;.
Refinements and localization of these procedures can be done by each member country of ICAO.
* United States
** FAA Pilot Controller Glossary
* United Kingdom
** Civil Aviation Authority&#x27;s Radiotelephony manual

==== Maritime Mobile Service ====

Voice procedures for use on ships and boats are defined by the International Telecommunication Union and the International Maritime Organization bodies of the United Nations, and by international treaties such as the Safety of Life a Sea Convention (a.k.a. SOLAS 74), and by other documents, such as the International Code of Signals.
* ITU Radio Regulations

==== Police procedures ====
In the U.S., the organization chartered with devising police communications procedures is APCO International, the Association of Police Communications Officers, which was founded in 1935. For the most part, APCO&#x27;s procedures have been developed independently of the worldwide standard operating procedures, leading to most police departments using a different spelling alphabet, and the reverse order of calling procedure (e.g. 1-Adam-12 calling Dispatch).

However, APCO occasionally follows the international procedure standards, having adopted the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Morse code procedure signs in the 1930s, and adopting the ICAO radiotelephony spelling alphabet in 1974, replacing its own Adam-Boy-Charles alphabet adopted in 1940, although very few U.S. police departments made the change.

APCO has also specified Standard Description Forms, a standard order of reporting information describing people and vehicles.

===== Standard description of persons =====
The Standard Description of Persons format first appeared in the April 1950 edition of the APCO Bulletin. It starts with a description of the person themself and finishes with a description of what they are wearing at the time.
===== Standard description of automobiles =====
APCO promotes the mnemonic CYMBALS for reporting vehicle descriptions:
=== Calling procedure ===
The voice calling procedure (sometimes referred to as &quot;method of calling&quot; or &quot;communications order model&quot;) is the standardized method of establishing communications. The order of transmitting the called station&#x27;s call sign, followed by the calling station&#x27;s call sign, was first specified for voice communications in the International Radiotelegraph Convention of Washington, 1927, however it matches the order used for the radiotelegraph calling procedure that had already existed since at least 1912. In the United States, the radiotelegraph calling procedure is legally defined in FCC regulations Part 80.97 (47 CFR 80.97(c)), which specifies that the method of calling begins with the call sign of the station called, not more than twice, [THIS IS] and the call sign of the calling station, not more than twice&quot;. This order is also specified by the ICAO for international aviation radio procedures (Annex 10 to the Convention on. International Civil Aviation: Aeronautical Telecommunications.), the FAA (Aeronautical Information Manual) and by the ITU-R for the Maritime Mobile Service (ITU-R M.1171), and the U.S. Coast Guard (Radiotelephone Handbook). The March, 1940 issue of The APCO Bulletin explains the origin of this order was found to have better results than other methods,
# MUST give the callsign of the station you are calling, twice (never three times)
# MUST follow the callsign with the proword THIS IS
# MUST give your callsign once, and once only
# Communicate
# SHOULD end your transmission with the proword OVER, or OUT, although this can be omitted when using a repeater that inserts a courtesy tone at the end of each transmission.

=== Break-in procedure ===
Stations needing to interrupt other communications in-progress shall use the most appropriate of the below procedure words, followed by their call sign.

The use of these emergency signals is governed by the International Radio Regulations that have the force of law in most countries, and were originally defined in the International Code of Signals and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, so the rules for their use emanate from that document.

All of these break-in procedure words must be followed by your call sign, because that information will help the NCS determine the relevant importance when dealing with multiple break-ins of the same precedence, and to determine the relevance when multiple calls offering a CORRECTION or INFO are received.
=== Order of priority of communications ===
The priority levels described below are derived from Article 44 of the ITU Radio Regulations, Chapter VIII, and were codified as early as the &quot;International Telecommunication Convention, Atlantic City, 1947&quot; (but probably existed much earlier).
=== Procedure words ===

Procedure words are a direct voice replacement for procedure signs (prosigns) and operating signals (such as Q codes), and must always be used on radiotelephone channels in their place. Prosigns/operating signals may only be used with Morse Code (as well as semaphore flags, light signals, etc.) and TTY (including all forms of landline and radio teletype, and Amateur radio digital interactive modes). The most complete set of procedure words is defined in the U.S. Military&#x27;s Allied Communications Publication ACP 125(G).
=== Radio checks ===
Whenever an operator is transmitting and uncertain of how good their radio and/or voice signal are, they can use the following procedure words to ask for a signal strength and readability report. This is the modern method of signal reporting that replaced the old 1 to 5 scale reports for the two aspects of a radio signal, and as with the procedure words, are defined in ACP 125(G):

The prowords listed below are for use when initiating and answering queries concerning signal strength and readability.
==== Signal strength prowords ====
In the tables below, the mappings of the QSA and QRK Morse code prosigns is interpreted because there is not a 1:1 correlation. See QSA and QRK code for the full procedure specification.
==== Readability prowords ====

The reporting format is one of the signal strength prowords followed by an appropriate conjunction, with that followed by one of the readability prowords:

LOUD AND CLEAR means Excellent copy with no noise

GOOD AND READABLE means Good copy with slight noise

FAIR BUT READABLE means Fair copy, occasional fills are needed

WEAK WITH INTERFERENCE means Weak copy, frequent fills are needed because of interference from other radio signals.

WEAK AND UNREADABLE means Unable to copy, a relay is required

According to military usage, if the response would be LOUD AND CLEAR, you may also respond simply with the proword ROGER. However, because this reporting format is not currently used widely outside of military organizations, it is better to always use the full format, so that there is no doubt about the response by parties unfamiliar with minimization and other shorthand radio operating procedures.

=== International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet ===
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), International Telecommunication Union, and the International Maritime Organization (all agencies of the United Nations), plus NATO, all specify the use of the ICAO Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet for use when it is necessary to spell out words, callsigns, and other letter/number sequences. It was developed with international cooperation and ratified in 1956, and has been in use unmodified ever since.

==== Rules for spelling ====
Spelling is necessary when difficult radio conditions prevent the reception of an obscure word, or of a word or group, which is unpronounceable. Such words or groups within the text of plain language messages may be spelt using the phonetic alphabet; they are preceded by the proword &quot;I SPELL&quot;. If the word is pronounceable and it is advantageous to do so, then it should be spoken before and after the spelling to help identify the word.

==== Rules for numbers and figures ====
When radio conditions are satisfactory and confusion will not arise, numbers in the text of a message may be spoken as in normal speech. During difficult conditions, or when extra care is necessary to avoid misunderstanding, numbers are sent figure by figure preceded by the proword FIGURES. This proword warns that figures follow immediately, to help distinguish them from other similarly pronounced words.

===Closing down===
Ending a two-way radio call has its own set of procedures:
*Generally, the station that originated the call is the station that should initiate termination of the call.
*All stations indicate their last transmission of a particular communication exchange by using the proword OUT (I intend no further communication with you at this time) or OUT TO YOU (I am ending my communication with you and calling another station).
*Stations going off the air (specifically turning their radio equipment off or leaving the station unattended) can additionally state that they are &quot;closing&quot; or &quot;closing down&quot;, based on the proword command &quot;CLOSE DOWN&quot;.

== Radio nets ==
Nets operate either on schedule or continuously (continuous watch). Nets operating on schedule handle traffic only at definite, prearranged times and in accordance with a prearranged schedule of intercommunication. Nets operating continuously are prepared to handle traffic at any time; they maintain operators on duty at all stations in the net at all times. When practicable, messages relating to schedules will be transmitted by a means of signal communication other than radio.

=== Net manager ===
A net manager is the person who supervises the creation and operation of a net over multiple sessions. This person will specify the format, date, time, participants, and the net control script. The net manager will also choose the Net Control Station for each net, and may occasionally take on that function, especially in smaller organizations.

=== Net Control Station ===
Radio nets are like conference calls in that both have a moderator who initiates the group communication, who ensures all participants follow the standard procedures, and who determines and directs when each other station may talk. The moderator in a radio net is called the Net Control Station, formally abbreviated NCS, and has the following duties:
* Establishes the net and closes the net;
* Directs Net activities, such as passing traffic, to maintain optimum efficiency;
* Chooses net frequency, maintains circuit discipline and frequency accuracy;
* Maintains a net log and records participation in the net and movement of messages; (always knows who is on and off net)
* Appoints one or more Alternate Net Control Stations (ANCS);
* Determines whether and when to conduct network continuity checks;
* Determines when full procedure and full call signs may enhance communications;
* Subject to Net Manager guidance, directs a net to be directed or free.
The Net Control Station will, for each net, appoint at least one Alternate Net Control Station, formally abbreviated ANCS (abbreviated NC2 in WWII procedures), who has the following duties:
* Assists the NCS to maintain optimum efficiency;
* Assumes NCS duties in event that the NCS develops station problems;
* Assumes NCS duties for a portion of the net, as directed or as needed;
* Serves as a resource for the NCS; echoes transmissions of the NCS if, and only if, directed to do so by the NCS;
* Maintains a duplicate net log

=== Structure of the net ===
Nets can be described as always having a net opening and a net closing, with a roll call normally following the net opening, itself followed by regular net business, which may include announcements, official business, and message passing. Military nets will follow a very abbreviated and opaque version of the structure outlined below, but will still have the critical elements of opening, roll call, late check-ins, and closing.

A net should always operate on the same principle as the inverted pyramid used in journalism—the most important communications always come first, followed by content in ever lower levels of priority.
# Net opening
## Identification of the NCS
## Announcement of the regular date, time, and frequency of the net
## Purpose of the net
# Roll call
## A call for stations to check in, oftentimes from a roster of regular stations
## A call for late check-ins (stations on the roster who did not respond to the first check-in period)
## A call for guest stations to check in
# Net business
# Optional conversion to a free net
# Net closing
Each net will typically have a main purpose, which varies according to the organization conducting the net, which occurs during the net business phase. For amateur radio nets, it&#x27;s typically for the purpose of allowing stations to discuss their recent operating activities (stations worked, antennas built, etc.) or to swap equipment. For Military Auxiliary Radio System and National Traffic System nets, net business will involve mainly the passing of formal messages, known as radiograms.

=== Time synchronization procedures ===

Stations without the ability to acquire a time signal accurate to at least one second should request a time check at the start of every shift, or once a day minimum. Stations may ask the NCS for a time check by waiting for an appropriate pause, keying up and stating your call sign, and then using the prowords &quot;REQUEST TIME CHECK, OVER&quot; when the NCS calls on you. Otherwise, you may ask any station that has access to any of the above time signals for a time check.

Once requested, the sending station will state the current UTC time plus one minute, followed by a countdown as follows:This is Net Control, TIME CHECK WUN AIT ZERO TOO ZULU (pause) WUN FIFE SECONDS…WUN ZERO SECONDS…FIFE FOWER TREE TOO WUN…TIME WUN AIT ZERO TOO ZULU…OVERThe receiving station will then use the proword &quot;TIME&quot; as the synch mark, indicating zero seconds. If the local time is desired instead of UTC, substitute the time zone code &quot;JULIETT&quot; for &quot;ZULU&quot;.

Instead of providing time checks on an individual basis, the NCS should give advance notice of a time check by stating, for example, &quot;TIME CHECK AT 0900 JULIETT&quot;, giving all stations sufficient time to prepare their clocks and watches for adjustment. A period of at least five minutes is suggested.

=== Modes of radio net operation ===
* Directed Net
** A net in which no station other than the net control station can communicate with any other station, except for the transmission of urgent messages, without first obtaining the permission of the net control station.
* Free net
** A net in which any station may communicate with any other station in the same net without first obtaining permission from the net control station to do so.

=== Types of net calls ===
When calling stations who are part of a net, a variety of types of calls can be used:
=== Types of radio nets ===
The Civil Air Patrol and International Amateur Radio Union define a number of different nets which represent the typical type and range used in civilian radio communications:
=== Radio net procedure words ===
U.S. Army Field Manual ACP 125(G) has the most complete set of procedure words used in radio nets:
==Example usage==

===Aeronautical mobile procedure===

The Federal Aviation Administration uses the term phraseology to describe voice procedure or communications protocols used over telecommunications circuits. An example is air traffic control radio communications. Standardised wording is used and the person receiving the message may repeat critical parts of the message back to the sender. This is especially true of safety-critical messages. Consider this example of an exchange between a controller and an aircraft:

Aircraft: Boston Tower, Warrior three five foxtrot (35F), holding short of two two right.&lt;br&gt;
Tower: Warrior three five foxtrot, Boston Tower, runway two two right, cleared for immediate takeoff. &lt;br&gt;
Aircraft: Roger, cleared for immediate takeoff, two two right, Warrier three five foxtrot.

On telecommunications circuits, disambiguation is a critical function of voice procedure. Due to any number of variables, including radio static, a busy or loud environment, or similarity in the phonetics of different words, a critical piece of information can be misheard or misunderstood; for instance, a pilot being ordered to &quot;eleven&quot; thousand as opposed to &quot;seven&quot; thousand (by hearing &quot;even&quot;). To reduce ambiguity, critical information may be broken down and read as separate letters and numbers. To avoid error or misunderstanding, pilots will often read back altitudes in the tens of thousands using both separate numbers and the single word (example: given a climb to 10,000 ft, the pilot replies &quot;[Callsign] climbing to One zero, Ten Thousand&quot;). However, this is usually only used to differentiate between 10,000 and 11,000 ft since these are the most common altitude deviations. The runway number read visually as eighteen, when read over a voice circuit as part of an instruction, becomes &quot;one eight&quot;. In some cases a spelling alphabet is used (also called a &quot;radio alphabet&quot; or a &quot;phonetic alphabet&quot;). Instead of the letters AB, the words &quot;Alpha Bravo&quot; are used. &quot;Main&quot; Street becomes &quot;Mike Alpha India November street&quot;, clearly separating it from Drain Street and Wayne Street. The numbers 5 and 9 are pronounced &quot;fife&quot; and &quot;niner&quot; respectively, since &quot;five&quot; and &quot;nine&quot; can sound the same over the radio. The use of &#x27;niner&#x27; in place of &#x27;nine&#x27; is due to German-speaking NATO allies for whom the spoken word &#x27;nine&#x27; could be confused with the German word &#x27;nein&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;.

Over fire service radios, phraseology may include words that indicate the priority of a message, for example:

Forty Four Truck to the Bronx, Urgent!

or

San Diego, Engine Forty, Emergency traffic!

Words may be repeated to modify them from traditional use in order to describe a critical message:

Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate!

A similar technique may be used in aviation for critical messages. For example, this transmission might be sent to an aircraft that has just landed and has not yet cleared the runway.

Echo-Foxtrot-Charlie, Tower. I have engine out traffic on short final. Exit runway at next taxiway. Expedite! Expedite!

Police Radios also use this technique to escalate a call that is quickly becoming an emergency.

Code 3! Code 3! Code 3!

Railroads have similar processes. When instructions are read to a locomotive engineer, they are preceded by the train or locomotive number, direction of travel and the engineer&#x27;s name. This reduces the possibility that a set of instructions will be acted on by the wrong locomotive engineer:

Five Sixty Six West, Engineer Jones, okay to proceed two blocks west to Ravendale.

Phraseology on telecommunications circuits may employ special phrases like ten codes, &quot;Sigalert&quot;, &quot;Quick Alert!&quot; or road service towing abbreviations such as &quot;T6&quot;. This jargon may abbreviate critical data and alert listeners by identifying the priority of a message. It may also reduce errors caused by ambiguities involving rhyming, or similar-sounding, words.

=== Maritime mobile procedure ===
(Done on VHF Ch 16)

Boat &quot;Albacore&quot; talking to Boat &quot;Bronwyn&quot;

Albacore: Bronwyn, Bronwyn, Bronwyn* this is Albacore, OVER. (*3×1, repeating the receiver&#x27;s callsign up to 3 times, and the sender&#x27;s once, is proper procedure and should be used when first establishing contact, especially over a long distance. A 1×1, i.e. &#x27;Bronwyn this is Albacore,&#x27; or 2×1, i.e. &#x27;Bronwyn, Bronwyn, this is Albacore,&#x27; is less proper, but acceptable especially for a subsequent contact.)

Bronwyn: Albacore, this is Bronwyn, OVER. (** At this point switch to a working channel as 16 is for distress and hailing only**)

Albacore: This is Albacore. Want a tow and are you OK for tea at Osbourne Bay? OVER.

Bronwyn: This is Bronwyn. Negative, got engine running, 1600 at clubhouse fine with us. OVER.

Albacore: This is Albacore, ROGER, OUT.

&quot;Copy that&quot; is incorrect. COPY is used when a message has been intercepted by another station, i.e. a third station would respond:

Nonesuch: Bronwyn, this is Nonesuch. Copied your previous, will also see you there, OUT.

One should always use one&#x27;s own callsign when transmitting.

=== British Army ===

Station C21A (charlie-two-one Alpha) talking to C33B (charlie-three-three Bravo):

C21A: C33B, this is C21A, message, OVER.

C33B: C33B, send, OVER.

C21A: Have you got C1ØD Sunray at your location?, OVER.

C33B: Negative, I think he is with C3ØC, OVER.

C21A: Roger, OUT.

The advantage of this sequence is that the recipient always knows who sent the message.

The downside is that the listener only knows the intended recipient from the context of the conversation. Requires moderate signal quality for the radio operator to keep track of the conversations.

However a broadcast message and response is fairly efficient.

Sunray (Lead) Charlie Charlie (Collective Call - everyone), this is Sunray. Radio check, OVER.

C-E-5-9: Sunray, this is Charlie Echo five niner, LOUD AND CLEAR, OVER.

Y-S-7-2 Sunray, this is Yankee Sierra Seven Two, reading three by four. OVER.

B-G-5-2: Sunray, this is Bravo Golf Five Two, Say again. OVER.

E-F-2-0: Sunray, this is Echo Foxtrot Two Zero, reading Five by Four OVER.

Sunray: Charlie Charlie this is Sunray, OUT.

The &quot;Say again&quot; response from B-G-5-2 tells Sunray that the radio signal is not good and possibly unreadable. Sunray can then re-initiate a Call onto B-G-5-2 and start another R/C or instruct them to relocate, change settings, etc.

So it could carry on with:

Sunray: Bravo Golf Five Two this is sunray, RADIO CHECK OVER.

B-G-5-2: Sunray this is Bravo Golf Five Two, unclear, read you 2 by 3 OVER.

Sunray: Sunray copies, Relocate to Grid One Niner Zero Three Three Two for a better signal OVER.

B-G-5-2: Bravo Golf Five Two copies and is Oscar Mike, Bravo Golf Five Two OUT.

<doc id="633266" wikidata="Q17089411" url="?curid=633266" title="Extra innings">
<text>Extra innings is the extension of a baseball or softball game in order to break a tie.

Ordinarily, a baseball game consists of nine regulation innings (in softball and high school baseball games there are typically seven innings; in Little League Baseball, six), each of which is divided into halves: the visiting team bats first, after which the home team takes its turn at bat. However, if the score remains tied at the end of the regulation number of complete innings, the rules provide that &quot;play shall continue until 

# The visiting team has scored more total runs than the home team at the end of a completed inning, or 
# The home team scores the winning run in an uncompleted inning.&quot; 

(Since the home team bats second, condition (2) does not allow the visiting team to score more runs before the end of the inning, unless the game is called before the inning ends).

The rules of the game, including the batting order, availability of substitute players and pitchers, etc., remain intact in extra innings. Managers must display caution to avoid exhausting all their substitute players during regular innings, in case the game reaches extensive extra innings. The rules call for a forfeiture if a team is unable to field a full team of nine players.

==Home-field advantage==
In Major League Baseball, home teams won about 52% of extra-inning games from 1957 to 2007. During this same time period, home teams have won about 54% of all baseball games. So while the home team has some advantage in extra-inning games, this advantage is less noticeable than the initial home-field advantage. Home teams tend to have the greatest advantage in run-scoring during the first 3 innings.

For the visiting team to win, it must score as many runs as possible in the first (or &quot;top&quot;) half of the inning and then prevent the home team from tying or taking the lead in the second (or &quot;bottom&quot;) half. Because it bats in the bottom half of an inning, a home team wins the game by taking the lead at any point in the final inning. Normally in such a situation, the moment the winning run scores for whatever reason (base hit, sacrifice, wild pitch), the game immediately ends and no other runs are allowed. The term for winning in this scenario is a &quot;walk-off&quot; win (as everyone can walk off the field as soon as the winning run is scored). The exception is if the winning hit is a walk-off home run; all runners on base and the batter must circle the bases on a home run, provided that they round them all correctly, so all their runs count for the final score. Each extra inning simply repeats this scenario. This is in contrast to the analogous penalty shootout used in ice hockey or association football, where shootout goals are counted separately and only one goal is awarded to the winner (hockey), or the game is recorded as a draw and the team winning the shootout is noted separately (association football); however, the same procedure of counting runs as if they were scored in regulation is like the overtime procedures in American football, Canadian football and basketball.

==Variants==

===Asia===
The East Asian professional leagues, NPB, KBO, and CPBL have a 12-inning limit before the game is declared a draw.

Additionally, NPB games have a total time limit of 210 minutes during the regular season before being counted as a tie. It is also 12 in postseason play, and the last game is completely replayed if drawn, leading to seven-game series that can go on for eight games, something that has happened only once (in the 1986 Japan Series). There are no limits on the number of innings in the eighth and subsequent game of the Japan Series. Furthermore, in 2021, a rule was added that starting in the 13th inning of the eighth (and subsequent) games, the two-runner WBSC tiebreaker would be used.

The KBO does not play extra innings in the first game of a double-header. Tie games are discarded when calculating winning percentages since 2002, except for 2008 when it was counted as a loss in the league&#x27;s standings. From the league&#x27;s formation in 1982 until 2001, they counted as half a win.

For CPBL postseason games, the 12-inning limit does not apply and the games will continue until a winner is decided. The longest game to be played took place during 2009 Taiwan Series, where in Game 6 the Brother Elephants defeated Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions 5 to 4 after 17 innings.

===International play===

====Baseball====
In the 11th inning, the manager selects anywhere in the batting order to start the inning, regardless of the last player put out. The batter immediately preceding this newly designated leadoff man becomes a runner on first base, and the next preceding batter is placed on second base. In subsequent innings, the batting order continues as normal, but the two players preceding the player scheduled to lead off (or substitutes for those players) the inning start on second and first.

This has also been adopted by European leagues Division de Honor (Spain), Italian Baseball League, and Honkbal Hoofdklasse (Netherlands).

Since the 2009 edition, a modified form of the rule has been used for the World Baseball Classic. Unlike the standard rule, the batting order may not start from a different place. Through the 2013 edition, the first inning in which teams started with runners on first and second was the 13th. The rule was not used in either the 2009 or 2013 editions because no game lasted more than 11 innings. For the 2017 World Baseball Classic, the rule was modified to use extra runners for the first time in the 11th inning, and it would see its first use in a second-round game between Japan and the Netherlands at the Tokyo Dome. Japan won that game thanks to a sacrifice bunt and a 2-run hit.

Other methods include the following:
*Putting runners on second and third (those who made the last two outs of the past inning) and an 0-2 count on the batter with no outs.
*Having bases loaded (runners being the last three outs of the past inning), with a 1-1 count on the batter and no outs.
*Sudden-death extra innings (the next team to score wins the game; this can result in a walk-off home run for the visiting team).

====Softball====
In international softball, a special extra innings rule starts immediately after regulation. Each team begins their half of the inning with a runner on second base (the last player to be put out). This increases the odds that teams will score and ensures a faster resolution. There is a drawback, though, in that the home team has a major advantage in batting second. Should the visiting team fail to score, all the home team must do to win is, for example, get a successful bunt and sacrifice fly to score the winning run, though a similar advantage exists in all extra-inning contests just not to that extent. This rule is also used in certain NCAA college conferences, usually applied after one or two extra innings where the &quot;international tiebreaker&quot; is not used.

===Major League Baseball===

====Spring training====
During spring training in Major League Baseball (MLB), most games are played for the regulation nine innings only; if the game is tied after nine innings, the game is over and the tie stands. There are multiple reasons for this brevity. Players are getting back into shape after the off-season, so shorter games help reduce injuries from overexertion. During spring training, teams often travel on a daily basis, so they need time to be able to travel to their next game. Lastly, there are no prizes or penalties associated with a team&#x27;s preseason record, so there is no need for a definitive winner in each game.

However, there have still been extra inning games in spring training, with the most recent one being on March 30, 2022, with the Houston Astros beating the New York Mets 5–3 in 10 innings.

====Regular season====
In 2020, MLB implemented the WBSC softball version of the extra innings rule where each extra inning is started with a runner on second base. As with the earlier WBSC rule, the objective is to increase scoring opportunities and shorten extra inning games. The batting order does not change, as the runner placed on second base is normally the player who, in the batting order, immediately precedes the batter leading off the inning. On July 24, 2020, the Oakland Athletics defeated the Los Angeles Angels, 7–3, in the first MLB extra-inning game played using this rule. The rule increased the percentage of extra inning games ending in the 10th inning from 43.9% during the 2019 season to 69.1% during the 2020 season. The rule was later extended into the 2021 and 2022 seasons and was made permanent beginning with the 2023 season.

====Postseason====
Extra runners are not used in MLB postseason games. Postseason games that last beyond nine innings begin all extra innings without any runner being placed on base.

==Longest games==

===Professional===
There are nine regulation innings in a professional baseball game.

====Minor League Baseball====
The record for the most innings played in a single professional game is 33, which occurred in 1981 in a Minor League Baseball game between the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings, at the time the Triple-A affiliates of the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles, respectively.

Each team had a future Hall of Famer on its roster: Wade Boggs for Pawtucket and Cal Ripken Jr. for Rochester.

====Major League Baseball====
The longest game by innings in Major League Baseball was a 1–1 tie in the National League between the Boston Braves and the Brooklyn Robins in 26 innings, at Braves Field in Boston on May 1, . It had become too dark to see the ball (fields did not have lights yet and the sun was setting), and the game was considered a draw. Played rapidly by modern standards, those 26 innings were completed in 3 hours and 50 minutes. As was the custom, the first pitch was thrown at 3:00 p.m., home plate umpire Barry McCormick called the game as lights began appearing in the windows of buildings across the Charles River, just before 7:00 p.m.

The longest American League game, and tied for the longest major league game by innings which ended with one team winning, was a 7–6 victory by the Chicago White Sox over the Milwaukee Brewers in 25 innings, at Comiskey Park in Chicago in . The game began at 7:30 p.m. on May 8, 1984, and after scoring early runs both teams scored twice in the 8th inning; but the game was suspended after 17 innings with the score tied 3–3 due to a league curfew rule prohibiting an inning from beginning after 12:59 a.m. The game was continued the following evening, May 9, 1984, and both teams scored three times in the 21st inning to make the score 6–6, finally, in the bottom of the 25th, the White Sox&#x27; Harold Baines hit a walk-off home run to end the contest. Tom Seaver was the winning pitcher in relief. A regularly scheduled game followed, meaning both nights saw 17 innings played; Seaver also started, and won, the second game 5–4. The official time of the entire 25-inning game was 8 hours, 6 minutes, also a major league record.

On September 12, 1974, baseball&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals won a marathon night game that had started the evening before, defeating the host New York Mets, 4 to 3, in the 25th inning after 7 hours and 4 minutes. This game is the longest National League contest to be played to a decision and is also tied with the aforementioned Brewers-White Sox game on May 8-9, 1984, for the longest game played to a decision in major league history. Two Mets errors led to the Cardinals&#x27; winning run, starting with an errant pickoff throw that allowed Bake McBride to scamper all the way around from first. The Mets went to the plate 103 times, a record in a major league game; the Cardinals were not far behind with 99 plate appearances. All told, a record 175 official at-bats were recorded, with a major-league record 45 runners stranded. Only a thousand fans were still at Shea Stadium when the game ended at 3:13 a.m. on September 12. Unlike the American League, the National League had no curfew. This was the longest game played to a decision without a suspension.

On April 15, , the Houston Astros defeated the Mets 1–0 in a 24-inning game at the Houston Astrodome. The 6-hour, 6-minute contest, which ended with the Astros&#x27; Bob Aspromonte hitting a grounder through the legs of Mets shortstop Al Weis in the bottom of the 24th, remains the longest shutout game in major league history. It also had the most scoreless innings (23) in a major-league game.

The longest American League game to end in a tie was a 24-inning contest between the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Athletics on July 21, . The teams were tied 1–1 when the game was called due to darkness at Shibe Park; the Tigers&#x27; Les Mueller had pitched a record 19 innings, giving up one run before being taken out in the 20th inning.

The longest game to end in a scoreless tie was a National League contest between the Cincinnati Reds and Brooklyn Dodgers on September 11, . The teams went 19 innings before darkness fell at Brooklyn&#x27;s Ebbets Field, forcing the game to be called on account of darkness. In the American League, the longest 0–0 game was played between the Washington Senators and Detroit Tigers on July 16, . The game was called after 18 innings due to darkness at Bennett Park in Detroit. The longest scoreless period within a completed game came in the April 15, 1968 game between the Astros and Mets which remained scoreless after 23 innings.

The Washington Senators became the first team in Major League history to play multiple games of at least 20 innings in a season when they defeated the Minnesota Twins 9–7 in 20 innings on August 9, 1967, after winning a 22-inning game over the Chicago White Sox on June 12 of that year. This feat would later be accomplished by the 1971 Oakland Athletics who had games of 21 and 20 innings and the 1989 Los Angeles Dodgers who played two 22-inning contests.

The longest doubleheader in Major League history was on May 31, . The San Francisco Giants beat the New York Mets 5–3 in nine innings in the day&#x27;s first game at Shea Stadium, and then won the nightcap 8–6 after 23 innings. The two games lasted a combined nine hours, 52 minutes. The Mets&#x27; Ed Kranepool played in all 32 innings of the two games; Kranepool had been called up to the team that day after having played in both games of a doubleheader the day before for their Triple-A club in Buffalo.

On April 5, , the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Cleveland Indians 7–4 in 16 innings. The five-hour, 14-minute game was the longest Opening Day game in Major League history.

On June 8, , the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Texas Rangers 4–3 in 18 innings while the Miami Marlins beat the New York Mets 2–1 in 20 innings. This was the second time in Major League history that two games of 18 innings or more were played on same day; the first was August 15, 2006.

In the 2013 season, the Arizona Diamondbacks set a major league record by playing 78 extra innings. This broke the season record of 76 extra innings played by the Minnesota Twins in .

In the 2020 season, and later extended into 2021 and 2022 before being made permanent in 2023, a new rule was added, adding a runner on second to begin each extra inning. The longest game played under these rules was a 16-inning game on August 25, 2021 between the Dodgers and Padres in San Diego where the Dodgers won 5–3 after both teams entered extra innings tied at 1 and traded two runs each in the 15th inning.

====Notable postseason extra-inning games====
In October 1999, in the &quot;Grand Single&quot; game 5 of the 1999 NLCS, with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 15th inning, Robin Ventura of the New York Mets, who had hit two grand slam home runs in one game during the regular season, hit the ball over the outfield fence for, apparently, another grand slam. He celebrated with his teammates and did not advance to second base. According to the rules, only one run scored, giving the Mets a 4–3 win over the Atlanta Braves.
The longest postseason game by innings in MLB history is 18 innings; this has occurred in four games, all of which were decided by a solo home run.

The first 18-inning contest was played between the Atlanta Braves and the Houston Astros on October 9, 2005. In Game 4 of a National League Division Series in Houston, the Braves (who were trailing the series 2–1 and facing elimination) took a 6–1 lead into the 8th inning. A grand slam by Lance Berkman in the bottom of the 8th brought the score to 6–5, and with two outs in the bottom of the 9th, Brad Ausmus homered to tie the game and send it to extra innings. The score remained deadlocked at 6–6 until the 18th, when the Astros&#x27; Chris Burke (who entered the game in the 9th inning as a pinch runner) hit a walk-off home run to left to win it, sending Houston to the NLCS. Roger Clemens, who was brought in to pinch-hit in the 15th and pitched the last three innings in relief, was credited as the winning pitcher in the 5-hour, 50-minute contest. Adam LaRoche and Tim Hudson played in both of the first two 18-inning games. This one as Atlanta Braves and the second one as opposing sides of one another with Hudson pitching in both games as the visiting team&#x27;s starting pitcher. It is the longest winner in a potential clinching game in baseball history.

The second 18-inning game was Game 2 of the 2014 National League Division Series, when the visiting San Francisco Giants defeated the Washington Nationals 2–1. The game ended just after midnight on October 5, 2014, and lasted 6 hours 23 minutes. The Nationals had been leading 1–0 with two out in the ninth inning, with starter Jordan Zimmermann one out away from a complete-game shutout. Following a decision by manager Matt Williams to remove Zimmermann with two out after he walked Joe Panik, Washington closer Drew Storen gave up a single to Giants catcher Buster Posey and an RBI double to Pablo Sandoval, scoring Panik to tie the game 1–1. Posey was thrown out at the plate trying to score the second San Francisco run on Sandoval&#x27;s double. After Sergio Romo retired the Nationals in order in the bottom half, the game went into extra innings. There was no further scoring until Giants first baseman Brandon Belt led off the top of the 18th inning with a home run. Hunter Strickland, a September call-up, recorded the save. Until 2022, this was the only one to go the full 18 innings.

The third 18-inning game was Game 3 of the 2018 World Series. It was played on October 26, 2018, between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers took a 1–0 lead in the 3rd inning when Joc Pederson homered off of Boston starter Rick Porcello. The Red Sox tied the game in the top of the 8th when Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a solo home run off of Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen. The game remained deadlocked at 1 until the 13th inning when Brock Holt scored on a throwing error by Dodgers reliever Scott Alexander. The Dodgers subsequently tied it again at 2 in the bottom of the inning, when Max Muncy scored on a throwing error by Red Sox second baseman Ian Kinsler (who had entered the game in the 10th inning as a pinch runner). The score remained 2–2 until the bottom of the 18th, when Muncy (who had missed a walk-off home run in the 15th inning by mere inches) hit a walk-off solo home run off of Red Sox pitcher Nathan Eovaldi (who was in his 7th inning of relief). The winning pitcher for the Dodgers was Alex Wood. With a duration of 7 hours and 20 minutes, this was also the longest postseason game by time in MLB history.

The fourth and most recent 18-inning game was Game 3 of the 2022 American League Division Series. It was played on October 15, 2022, between the Houston Astros and Seattle Mariners at T-Mobile Park. The Astros took a 1–0 lead in the top of the 18th inning on a home run by Shortstop Jeremy Peña. The Mariners went 1-2-3 in the bottom half of the 18th, allowing a 3-game sweep by the Astros to advance to the American League Championship Series, and it took 6 hours, 22 minutes to finish the longest shutout game in postseason history. The 17 scoreless innings in a game set a new Major League postseason record.

The 1986 National League Championship Series was notable for its two climactic extra-inning games. After the Houston Astros and the New York Mets split the first four games of the series, the Mets won Game 5 in 12 innings and Game 6 in 16 innings to claim the pennant.

The 1986 American League Championship Series between the Boston Red Sox and the California Angels featured a dramatic game where the Angels were leading 3 games to 1 and leading 5–4 in game 5, one strike away from the first pennant in franchise history, only for Red Sox&#x27;s Dave Henderson hit a two-run home run off Angels closer Donnie Moore in the top of the ninth inning to give the Red Sox the lead. The Angels tied it in the bottom half but in the top of the 11th, Henderson&#x27;s sacrifice fly off Moore proved to be the winning margin and the Angels lost the game. The series returned to Boston and the Angels were outscored a combined 18–5 in games 6 and 7 to lose the pennant.

Game 6 of the 1986 World Series between the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox went into extra innings as well. The Red Sox scored 2 runs in the top of the 10th inning to take a 5–3 lead and then got two quick outs with no one on base in the bottom of the 10th. With the Red Sox one out away from their first world championship in 68 years, reliever Calvin Schiraldi gave up three straight singles (to Gary Carter, Kevin Mitchell, and Ray Knight), with Carter scoring on Knight&#x27;s single to cut the lead to one run with runners on first and third. Red Sox manager John McNamara replaced Schiraldi with Bob Stanley, who then threw a two-strike wild pitch to Mookie Wilson to allow Mitchell to score the tying run and move Knight to second base. The wild pitch was particularly notable in that it completely turned the tables on the Red Sox from what they had done while facing the Angels weeks earlier, as they themselves had now blown a situation in which they were one strike away from winning the series. Wilson subsequently hit a ground ball to first base that rolled through the legs of first baseman Bill Buckner, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second base and sending the Series to a Game 7 where the Mets completed the comeback. Had Buckner not committed this error, the game would have either remained tied with runners on first and third for the next batter (if Wilson was safe) or would have gone to an 11th inning (if Wilson had been out).

The 1980 National League Championship Series, played between the Houston Astros and the Philadelphia Phillies, had four of its five games go to extra innings. The Astros won Games 2 and 3 in 10 and 11 innings respectively, while the Phillies took Games 4 and 5 in 10 innings each.

Game 6 of the 2011 World Series invokes echoes of 1986. In the bottom of the 9th inning, the Texas Rangers were one strike away from winning their first World Series when David Freese hit a two-run triple to tie the game 7–7 and send the game to extra innings. In the 10th, Josh Hamilton hit a two-run home run to give the Rangers a 9–7 lead, but the Cardinals responded with two runs to tie the game again at 9. The game ended in the 11th inning when Freese led off with a walk-off solo home run. Just like the Mets did in 1986, the Cardinals went on to win Game 7 and the championship.

The 2012 American League Division Series between the Baltimore Orioles and the New York Yankees had back-to-back extra-inning games, going 12 and 13 innings respectively. The Yankees won Game 3 on a walk-off home run by Raúl Ibañez and the Orioles returned the favor the next night by winning Game 4.

In the 1995 American League Division Series, the Seattle Mariners and Yankees battled in Game 2 in 15 innings. The Yankees won the game on a two-run walk-off home run by Jim Leyritz, setting the record for longest game in MLB postseason history by time until 2005. In Game 5, the Mariners won the game and the series in 11 innings on Edgar Martínez&#x27;s famous double that scored Ken Griffey Jr. Until 2011, this was the only LDS game 5 in either league to go into extra innings.

The 2014 American League Wild Card Game featured the first extra-inning game in its third year of postseason existence, was won by the Kansas City Royals over the Oakland Athletics in 12 innings.

The longest Game 7 in postseason history was during the 1924 World Series where the Washington Senators beat the New York Giants 4–3 in 12 innings to claim the title.

The longest &quot;winner take all&quot; game (defined as the final game of a postseason series, in which the winning team clinches the title or advances to the next round while the loser is eliminated from the postseason) in MLB postseason history is the 2018 National League Wild Card Game, won by the Colorado Rockies over the Chicago Cubs 2–1 in 13 innings.

=====All-Star Game=====
The longest major league All-Star Game by time was played on July 15, 2008, at Yankee Stadium, with the American League winning 4–3 in 15 innings after four hours, 50 minutes.
Michael Young hit the walk-off sacrifice fly to win it. This was the first time in All-Star game history that the AL won an All-Star Game in extra innings. The previous nine times the National League went 8–0–1 in extra-inning games.

The All-Star Game of July 11, 1967, at Anaheim Stadium also lasted 15 innings, but was considerably shorter in terms of elapsed time. The All-Star Game of July 9, 2002, at Miller Park was controversially declared a 7–7 tie after 11 innings, when both teams ran out of available pitchers.

Since the 2022 All-Star Game, if the All-Star Game is tied after nine innings, the winner will be decided by a home run derby rather than with extra innings. Despite the association with the All-Star Game, this is distinct from the annual home run derby held every year the day before the All-Star Game. The rules differ somewhat from the regular home run derby, with each manager selecting three players to make three swings
each to hit as many home runs as possible. If a tie remains, sudden death triple-swing rounds will be played until one team outslugs the other. The winning team will be credited with a run and a hit.

=====World Series=====
Over the history of the World Series, 64 games have gone to extra innings, setting the following innings-related records.

*&quot;Most extra innings&quot; played in a &quot;World Series game&quot;: 9 (2018, game 3). Further, game 3 was the longest World Series game played in terms of elapsed time.
*&quot;Most extra innings&quot; played &quot;over the course of a World Series&quot;: 9 (2018). This record, distinct from the above, was also set by the large number of extra innings in 2018&#x27;s game 3 alone, eclipsing the previous record 8 extra innings logged in games 1 and 5 of the 2015 Series.
*&quot;Most innings&quot; played &quot;over the course of a World Series&quot;: 75 (1912). 1912 was one of seven historically unusual Series: four (1903, 1919, 1920, 1921) were best-of-nine contests, and three (1907, 1912, 1922) were best-of-seven contests which each had one tie game apiece. In the 1912 Series, game 2 concluded as an 11-inning tie and the Series-deciding game 8 went for 10 innings, padding the Series&#x27; total inning count to 75.
*&quot;Most innings&quot; played &quot;over the course of a standard World Series&quot;: 69 (1924, 1991). &quot;Standard&quot; denotes best-of-seven Series which had no tie games, excluding the seven above Series. 1924&#x27;s games 1 and 7 each went for 12 innings, while 1991&#x27;s games 3, 6 and 7 went for 12, 11 and 10 innings, respectively.
*&quot;Most games running to extra innings&quot;, played &quot;over the course of a World Series&quot;: 3 (1991). No other Series has had more than two games running to extra innings.

Additionally, World Series-deciding games have gone to extra innings 10 times: 1912&#x27;s game 8, 1924&#x27;s game 7, 1933&#x27;s game 5, 1939&#x27;s game 4, 1991&#x27;s game 7, 1992&#x27;s game 6, 1997&#x27;s game 7, 2012&#x27;s game 4, 2015&#x27;s game 5, and 2016&#x27;s game 7 all went past 9 innings before a champion was determined.

====Japan Series====
On November 6, 2010, the record for longest Japan Series game was set in Game 6. The Chiba Lotte Marines and the Chunichi Dragons played 15 innings totaling 5 hours and 43 minutes. The game ended a 2–2 tie leading to a Game 7 in which the Marines won the game and the championship. There has always been a playing cap in NPB play. For day games, it was sunset, and later 17.30. For night games, it was 22.30. From 1982 to 1986, the time limit was set to 4 hour, 30 minutes. In 1987, the cap changed from time to innings, with the cap being 18 innings in 1987, reduced to 15 in 1994, and since 2018, the limit is 12 innings. In addition, there is no limit on the number of innings played in an eighth or subsequent game. In 2021, starting in the 13th inning of a Game 8 or later, the WBSC tiebreaker with runners on first and second base is used.

====Taiwan Series====
The longest game in Taiwan Series&#x27;s history took place in Game 6 on October 24, 2009. The Brother Elephants defeated the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions 5 to 4 and tied the series 3–3 after 17 innings that totals 6 hours 14 minutes. The Lions eventually took the title after defeating the Elephants 5 to 2 in Game 7. The 12 inning limit is not used in postseason play in CPBL play.

===College baseball===
The longest college baseball game was played between Texas and Boston College on May 30, 2009, in a regional NCAA Division I Baseball Championship tournament game at Austin, Texas. Texas won the game, 3–2, in 25 innings as the visiting team under NCAA tournament rules on home-team declaration during a tournament. The game lasted seven hours and three minutes. Three years later, another NCAA tournament game passed the 20-inning mark when Kent State defeated Kentucky, 7–6, in 21 innings in an opening-round game at the Gary Regional in Gary, Indiana.
==Other records==
The 1943 Boston Red Sox played an MLB record 31 extra inning games, winning 15 and losing 14, with 2 games tied. They played 73 extra innings that season, equivalent to playing an additional eight nine-inning games. The fewest extra inning games played in a season (dating back to at least 1908) is one, by the 2020 St. Louis Cardinals, who played only 58 games in a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2016 Los Angeles Angels played four extra inning games, the fewest in a 162-game season, and lost all four. The record for most extra inning victories in a season is held by the 1959 Pittsburgh Pirates, who won 19 of their 21 extra inning games (one of the two losses came vs. the Milwaukee Braves in the bottom of the 13th at County Stadium after Harvey Haddix pitched 12 perfect innings).

The convention of the visiting team batting first means that there is no limit to the possible margin of victory for the visitors in extra innings. The MLB record is held by the 1983 Texas Rangers, who put up 12 unanswered runs in the top of the 15th inning to defeat the Oakland Athletics by a score of 16–4 on July 3. Conversely, for the home team who bats second, the highest possible margin of victory is four.

<text>The U.S. Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS, pronounced &quot;T-driss&quot;) is a network of American communications satellites (each called a tracking and data relay satellite, TDRS) and ground stations used by NASA for space communications. The system was designed to replace an existing network of ground stations that had supported all of NASA&#x27;s crewed flight missions. The prime design goal was to increase the time spacecraft were in communication with the ground and improve the amount of data that could be transferred. Many Tracking and Data Relay Satellites were launched in the 1980s and 1990s with the Space Shuttle and made use of the Inertial Upper Stage, a two-stage solid rocket booster developed for the shuttle. Other TDRS were launched by Atlas IIa and Atlas V rockets.

The most recent generation of satellites provides ground reception rates of 6 Mbit/s in the S-band and 800 Mbit/s in the Ku- and Ka-bands. This is mainly used by the United States military.

In 2022 NASA announced that it would gradually phase out the TDRS system and rely on commercial providers of communication satellite services.

==Origins==
To satisfy the requirement for long-duration, highly available space-to-ground communications, NASA created the Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STADAN) in the early 1960s. Consisting of parabolic dish antennas and telephone switching equipment deployed around the world, the STADAN provided space-to-ground communications for approximately 15 minutes of a 90-minute orbit period. This limited contact-period sufficed for uncrewed spacecraft, but crewed spacecraft require a much higher data collection time.

A side-by-side network established right after STADAN in the early 1960s, called the Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN), interacted with crewed spacecraft in Earth orbit. Another network, the Deep Space Network (DSN), interacted with crewed spacecraft higher than 10,000 miles from Earth, such as the Apollo missions, in addition to its primary mission of data collection from deep space probes.

With the creation of the Space Shuttle in the mid-1970s, a requirement for a higher performance space-based communication system arose. At the end of the Apollo program, NASA realized that MSFN and STADAN had evolved to have similar capabilities and decided to merge the two networks to create the Spacecraft Tracking and Data Network (STDN).

Even after consolidation, STDN had some drawbacks. Since the entire network consisted of ground stations spread around the globe, these sites were vulnerable to the political whims of the host country. In order to maintain a high-reliability rate coupled with higher data transfer speeds, NASA began a study to augment the system with space-based communication nodes.

The space segment of the new system would rely upon satellites in geostationary orbit. These satellites, by virtue of their position, could transmit and receive data to lower orbiting satellites and still stay within sight of the ground station. The operational TDRSS constellation would use two satellites, designated TDE and TDW (for &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot;), and one on-orbit spare.

After the study was completed, NASA realized that a minor system modification was needed to achieve 100% global coverage. A small area would not be within line-of-sight of any satellites – a so-called Zone of Exclusion (ZOE). With the ZOE, neither TDRS satellite could contact a spacecraft under a certain altitude (646 nautical miles). With the addition of another satellite to cover the ZOE and ground station nearby, 100% coverage could exist. The space-based network study created a system that became the plan for the present-day TDRSS network design.

As early as the 1960s, NASA&#x27;s Application Technology Satellite (ATS) and Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) programs prototyped many of the technologies used on TDRSS and other commercial communications satellites, including frequency division multiple-access (FDMA), three-axis spacecraft stabilization and high-performance communications technologies.

, TDRS project manager is Jeff J. Gramling, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Robert P. Buchanan, Deputy Project Manager, retired after 41 years at NASA with TDRS as one of final missions. Boeing is responsible for the construction of TDRS K.

==The network==
TDRSS is similar to most other space systems, whereby it is composed of three segments: the ground, space and user segments. These three segments work in conjunction to accomplish the mission. An emergency or failure in any one segment could have catastrophic impact on the rest of the system. For this reason all segments have redundancy factored in.

==Ground segment==

The ground segment of TDRSS consists of three ground stations located at the White Sands Complex (WSC) in southern New Mexico, the Guam Remote Ground Terminal (GRGT) at Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station Guam, and Network Control Center located at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. These three stations are the heart of the network, providing command &amp; control services. Under a system upgrade that has been completed, a new terminal has been built at Blossom Point, Maryland.

WSC, located near Las Cruces consists of:
*White Sands Ground Terminal (WSGT) 
*Second TDRSS Ground Terminal (STGT) 
*Extended TDRS Ground Terminal (ETGT)

Additionally, the WSC remotely controls the GRGT on Guam.

The WSC has its own exit from U.S. Route 70 that is for facility staff only. NASA decided on the location of the ground terminals using very specific criteria. Foremost was the ground station&#x27;s view of the satellites; the location had to be close enough to the equator to view the skies, both east and west. Weather was another important factor – New Mexico has, on average, almost 350 days of sunshine per year, with a very low precipitation level.

WSGT went online with the 1983 launch of TDRS-A by the Space Shuttle Challenger. STGT became operational in 1994, completing the system after Flight-6&#x27;s on-orbit checkout earlier in the year. Additionally, after completion of the second terminal, NASA held a contest to name the two stations. Local middle school students chose Cacique (kah-see-keh), meaning &quot;leader&quot; for WSGT, and Danzante meaning &quot;dancer&quot; for STGT. These names seem to have been for publicity purposes only, for official NASA documentation use WSGT and STGT or WSC as designators.

WSGT and STGT are geographically separated and completely independent of one another, while retaining a backup fiber-optic link to transfer data between sites in case of emergency. Each ground station has 19-meter dishes, known as Space-Ground Link Terminals (SGLT), to communicate with the satellites. Three SGLTs are located at STGT, but only two are located at WSGT. The system architects moved the remaining SGLT to Guam to provide full network support for the satellite covering the ZOE. Considered a remote part of the WSGT, the distance and location of the SGLT is transparent to network users.

The Guam Remote Ground Terminal (GRGT) is an extension of the WSGT. The terminal contains SGLT 6, with the Communication Service Controller (CSC) located at STGT&#x27;s TDRS Operations Control Center (TOCC). Before the GRGT was operational, an auxiliary system was located at Diego Garcia.

===Incorporation into the STDN===
The major parts of the Space Flight Tracking and Data Network (STDN) are: the NASA Integrated Services Network (NISN), network control center (NCC), mission operations center (MOC), spacecraft data processing facility (SDPF), and the multi mission flight dynamics lab (MMFD).

NISN provides the data transfer backbone for space missions. It is a cost-effect wide area network telecommunications service for transmission of data, video, and voice for all NASA enterprises, programs and centers. This part of the STDN consists of infrastructure and computers dedicated to monitor network traffic flow, such as fiber optic links, routers and switches. Data can flow through NISN two ways: using the Internet Protocol Operational Network (IPONET) or the High Data Rate System (HDRS). IPONET uses the TCP/IP protocol common to all computers connected to the Internet, and is a standard way to ship data. The High Data Rate System transports data rates from 2 Mbit/s to 48 Mbit/s, for specialized missions requiring a high rate of data transfer. HDRS does not require the infrastructure of routers, switches and gateways to send its data forward like IPONET.

The NCC provides service planning, control, assurance and accountability. Service planning takes user requests and disseminates the information to the appropriate SN elements. Service control and assurance supports functions of real-time usage, such as receipt, validation, display and dissemination of TDRSS performance data. Service accountability provides accounting reports on the use of the NCC and network resources. The NCC was originally located at Goddard Space-flight Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland until 2000, when it was relocated to the WSC.

The MOC is the focal point of spacecraft operations. It will schedule requests for support, monitor spacecraft performance and upload control information to the spacecraft (through TDRSS). MOC consists of principal investigators, mission planners and flight operators. Principal investigators initiate requests for SN support. Mission planners provide documentation for the spacecraft and its mission. And flight operators are the final link, sending commands to the spacecraft and performing the operations.

The MMFD lab provides flight project and tracking network support. Flight project support consists of orbital and attitude determination and control. Orbital parameters are traced through the actual orbit of the mission spacecraft and compared to its predicted orbit. Attitude determination computes sets of parameters that describe a spacecraft&#x27;s orientation relative to known objects (Sun, Moon, stars or Earth&#x27;s magnetic field). Tracking network support analyzes and evaluates the quality of the tracking data.

==Space segment==

The space segment of the TDRSS constellation is the most dynamic part of the system. Even with nine satellites on orbit, the system provides support with three primary satellites, while using the rest as on-orbit spares capable of immediate usage as primaries. The original TDRSS design had two primary satellites, designated TDE, for &quot;east&quot;, and TDW, for &quot;west&quot; and one on-orbit spare. The surge in user requirements during the 1980s allowed NASA to expand the network with the addition of more satellites, with some being co-located in a particularly busy orbital slot. See Tracking and Data Relay Satellite for more details on the satellites.

==User segment==
The user segment of TDRSS includes many of NASA&#x27;s most prominent programs. Programs such as the Hubble Space Telescope and LANDSAT relay their observations to their respective mission control centers through TDRSS. Since crewed space flight was one of the primary reasons for building TDRSS, the space shuttle and International Space Station voice communications are routed through the system.

==Operations==

The TDRSS system has been used to provide data relay services to many orbiting observatories, and also to Antarctic facilities such as McMurdo Station by way of the TDRSS South Pole Relay. The US-built sections of the International Space Station (ISS) use TDRSS for data relay. TDRSS is also used to provide launch data relay for expendable boosters.

==Military applications==
As early as 1989, it was reported that an important function of TDRSS was to provide data relay for the Lacrosse radar imaging reconnaissance satellites operated by the National Reconnaissance Office.

Almost twenty years later, on November 23, 2007, an on-line trade publication noted, &quot;While NASA uses the (TDRSS) satellites to communicate with the space shuttle and international space station, most of their bandwidth is devoted to the Pentagon, which covers the lion&#x27;s share of TDRSS operations costs and is driving many of the system&#x27;s requirements, some of them classified.&quot;

In October 2008, the NRO declassified the existence of mission ground stations in the US called Aerospace Data Facility (ADF)- Colorado, ADF-East and ADF-Southwest near Denver, Colorado, Washington, D.C., and Las Cruces, New Mexico, respectively. ADF-Colorado and ADF-East are known to be located at Buckley AFB, CO and Fort Belvoir, Virginia; ADF-Southwest is located at White Sands Missile Range, assumed to be at the White Sands TDRSS station.

==Production==
The first seven TDRSS satellites were built by the TRW corporation (now part of Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems) in Redondo Beach, California, and all of the satellites since then by Hughes Space and Communications, Inc., in El Segundo, California, (now a part of the Boeing corporation).

== Cultural references ==
The TDRSS system is briefly mentioned in the James Bond movie, &quot;Moonraker&quot;. It is also brought up in the 1997 movie &quot;Event Horizon&quot;.

== Launch history ==

Note: while a TDRSS satellite is in the manufacturing process it is given a letter designation, but once it has successfully achieved the correct geosynchronous orbit it is referred to with a number (for example, TDRS-A during development and before on-orbit acceptance, and TDRS-1 after acceptance on orbit and put into operational use). Thus, satellites that are lost in launch failures or have massive malfunctions are never numbered (for example, TDRS-B, which was never numbered due to its loss in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster).

<text>James Caldwell (April 1734 – November 24, 1781) was a Presbyterian minister who played a prominent part in the American Revolution.

==Biography==
Caldwell was born in Cub Creek in Charlotte County, Province of Virginia, the seventh son of John and Margaret Caldwell, who were Scots-Irish settlers, and traced their ancestry to Huguenots who fled France to Scotland in the 16th century, established Caldwell Castle and later defended the Ulster Plantation and Derry. James Caldwell graduated from the College of New Jersey (later called Princeton University) in 1759 and, although he inherited in Cub Creek, chose to become pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. He was an active partisan on the side of the Patriots, and was known as the &quot;Fighting Parson&quot;. His church and his house were burned by Loyalists in 1780. 

While Caldwell was stationed with the army in Morristown, his wife Hannah was shot by a British light infantryman under disputed circumstances during the Battle of Connecticut Farms in what is now Union Township, an act which Union County immortalizes on their county seal to this day. His wife had been at home with their baby and a 3 year old toddler. As British forces moved into the Connecticut Farms, Hannah Caldwell was shot through a window as she sat with her children on a bed.

Caldwell, who fought in the Battle of Springfield, was killed on November 24, 1781, by an American sentry in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, when he refused to have a package inspected. The sentry, James Morgan, was hanged for murder on January 29, 1782 in Westfield, New Jersey, amid rumors that he had been bribed to kill the chaplain. Their nine orphaned children were raised by the family&#x27;s friends.

==Legacy==
*A monument to Caldwell in Elizabeth, New Jersey was dedicated in 1846. 
*Three towns, known collectively as The Caldwells are named for James Caldwell: 
**Caldwell, New Jersey
**North Caldwell, New Jersey
**West Caldwell, New Jersey
**Caldwell Township, New Jersey
Schools
*James Caldwell High School in West Caldwell 
* James Caldwell Elementary School in Springfield, New Jersey.
*Caldwell University (formerly Caldwell College) located in Caldwell, NJ also carries his name.

<doc id="633282" wikidata="Q503274" url="?curid=633282" title="BMW 7 Series">
<text>The BMW 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan manufactured and marketed by the German automaker BMW since 1977. It is the successor to the BMW E3 &quot;New Six&quot; sedan and is now in its seventh generation.

The 7 Series is BMW&#x27;s flagship car and is only available in a sedan bodystyle (including long wheelbase and limousine models). It traditionally introduces technologies and exterior design themes before other models in BMW&#x27;s lineup.

The first generation of the 7 Series was powered by straight-6 petrol engines, and following generations have been powered by inline-4, straight-6, V8 and V12 engines with both natural aspiration and turbocharging. Since 1995, diesel engines have been optional in the 7 Series.

Unlike the BMW 3 Series and BMW 5 Series sedans, BMW does not offer a full M model, but once offered an M performance variant, the BMW M760 with its 6.6L V12 (at the time the most powerful BMW ever made, not to be confused with BMW 760 6.6 V12 which does not offer the same performance). The Alpina B7 (G12) served as the high-performance variant of the 7 Series.

== First generation (E23; 1977) ==

The E23 is the first generation 7 Series and was produced from 1977 to 1987. It was built in a 4-door sedan style with 6-cylinder engines, to replace the E3 sedans. From 1983 to 1987, a turbocharged 6-cylinder engine was available in some markets.

The E23 introduced many electronic features for the first time in a BMW, including an onboard computer, a service interval indicator, a &quot;check control panel&quot; (warning lights to indicate system faults to the driver), a dictaphone, and complex climate control systems. It was also the first BMW to offer an anti-lock braking system (ABS), a driver&#x27;s airbag, and double-link front suspension.

== Second generation (E32; 1986) ==

The E32 is the second generation of the 7 Series, which was produced from 1986 to 1994. It was initially available with a straight-six or V12 engine, the latter being Germany&#x27;s first passenger car with a V12 since World War II. In 1992, V8 engines became available.

The E32 introduced the following features for the first time in a BMW: Electronic Damper Control, V12 and V8 engines, double glazing, the CAN bus electronic protocol, Xenon headlamps, traction control and dual-zone climate control. The E32 750i was the first car adhering to BMW&#x27;s self-imposed speed limit of .
The &#x27;iL&#x27; models re-introduced a long-wheelbase option not offered by BMW since the &#x27;L&#x27; variants of the E3 &quot;New Six&quot;.

== Third generation (E38; 1994) ==


The E38 is the third generation of the 7 Series, which was produced from 1994 to 2001. The model range consisted of standard length and long wheelbase (&quot;iL&quot; models) sedans.

The petrol engines available consisted of straight-six, V8 and V12 engines. The E38 was the first 7 Series to be available with a diesel engine; initially, a turbocharged straight-six, which was joined by a twin-turbocharged V8 in 1999.

The E38 was the first car available with curtain airbags. It was also the first European car to offer satellite navigation and the first BMW to offer an in-built television.

In 1999, the model received a facelift.

== Fourth generation (E65/E66/E67/E68; 2001) ==

The E65/E66/E67/E68 is the fourth generation 7 Series, which was produced from 2001 to 2008. The model range consisted of standard length and long wheelbase (&quot;Li&quot; models) sedans.

The E65/E66/E67/E68 was the first BMW to include iDrive, &quot;flame-surfacing&quot; exterior styling, active anti-roll bars, a 6-speed automatic transmission, an electronic smart Key (dispensing with the traditional metallic key) and night vision. The 760i model was the world&#x27;s first production V12 engine to use direct injection.

== Fifth generation (F01/F02/F03/F04; 2008) ==


The F01/F02/F03/F04 is the fifth-generation 7 Series, which was produced from 2008 to 2015. The model range consisted of standard length and long wheelbase (&quot;Li&quot; models) sedans.

The F01 was the first BMW to be available with a hybrid drivetrain (&quot;ActiveHybrid 7&quot;), 8-speed automatic transmission, and a turbocharged V12 engine. It was also the first 7 Series to be available with a turbocharged petrol engine and all-wheel drive (xDrive).

In 2013, the model received a minor styling facelift.

== Sixth generation (G11/G12; 2015) ==


The G11/G12 is the sixth generation of the 7 Series, which entered production in 2015. It was revealed on June 10, 2015, at BMW&#x27;s headquarters in Munich. An official public reveal took place at the 2015 International Motor Show Germany.

G11 is the codename for the short-wheelbase model, the Long-wheelbase model is codenamed G12 and designated with an additional &quot;L&quot; letter.

The G11/G12 is the first car lineup of the BMW Group to be based on the modular OKL platform (Oberklasse, German for luxury class). The OKL platform adopts technology first introduced in BMW i models, namely the introduction of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer as structural chassis components.

As part of BMW&#x27;s strategy of introducing plug-in hybrid variants for all future car models, both, the short and long-wheelbase models will be available with hybrid powertrains under the designations 740e and 740Le in 2016.

A LCI model appeared in 2019 which prominently features a larger grille.

== Seventh generation (G70/G73; 2022) ==

The BMW G70 debuted in April 2022. It has an electric variant, the BMW i7, along with Inline 6 740i and V8 760i models. It adopts horizontally split headlight units featured on the X7 LCI which was also launched in April 2022. Engine options remain similar with 3.0-litre Inline 6 and 4.4-litre V8 options but no more V12 engines will be offered.

=== BMW i7 ===
The BMW i7 is an electric variant to the BMW 7 Series, which was unveiled alongside it in April 2022. The i7 xDrive60 is powered by two electric motors generating a combined output of and of torque. It can accelerate 0-60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 4.5 seconds and EPA-range around .

<doc id="633283" wikidata="Q336691" url="?curid=633283" title="Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma">
<text>Patricia Edwina Victoria Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma, Baroness Brabourne, , , (née Mountbatten; 14 February 1924 – 13 June 2017), was a British peeress and third cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. She was the elder daughter of Admiral of the Fleet the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma and of heiress Edwina Ashley (a patrilineal descendant of the earls of Shaftesbury, first ennobled in 1661). She was the elder sister of Lady Pamela Hicks, the first cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and the last surviving baptismal sponsor to her first cousin once removed King Charles III. She was the great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria.

Lady Mountbatten succeeded her father to the Earldom Mountbatten of Burma when he was assassinated in 1979, as his peerages had been created with special remainder to his daughters and their heirs male. This inheritance accorded her the title of &quot;countess&quot; and a seat in the House of Lords, where she remained until 1999, when the House of Lords Act 1999 removed most hereditary peers from the House.

==Marriage and children==
On 26 October 1946, she married John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne (9 November 1924 – 23 September 2005), at the time an aide to her father in the Far East. They had met after Patricia, having served in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service, was commissioned in 1945 as a third officer and was serving in the Supreme Allied Headquarters, South East Asia. The wedding took place at Romsey Abbey in the presence of members of the royal family. Her bridesmaids were Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, Lady Pamela Mountbatten (the bride&#x27;s younger sister), and Princess Alexandra, daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Kent.

Later, they became one of the few married couples each of whom held a peerage in their own right, and whose descendants inherited titles through both. They had eight children:
*Norton Louis Philip Knatchbull, 3rd Earl Mountbatten of Burma (born 8 October 1947), married Penelope Meredith Mary Eastwood (born 16 April 1953) on 20 October 1979 and have three children.
*The Hon. Michael-John Ulick Knatchbull (born 24 May 1950), producer and editor, married Melissa Clare Owen (born 12 November 1960), daughter of judge Sir John Arthur Dalziel Owen, on 1 June 1985 and had one daughter; divorced in 1997; married Susan Penelope &quot;Penny&quot; Jane Henderson &quot;née&quot; Coates (born 23 October 1959), daughter of Stephen Cedric Coates, a civil engineer and businessman, on 6 March 1999 and had one daughter; divorced on 13 February 2006.
*The Hon. Anthony Knatchbull (born/died 6 April 1952)
*Lady Joanna Edwina Doreen Knatchbull (born 5 March 1955), married French Baron Hubert Pernot du Breuil (2 February 1956 – 6 September 2004) on 3 November 1984 and had one daughter; divorced in 1995; married Azriel Zuckerman (born 18 January 1943 in Bucharest, Romania, and educated at the University of Oxford) on 19 November 1995 and had one son.
*Lady Amanda Patricia Victoria Knatchbull (born 26 June 1957), married Charles Vincent Ellingworth (born 7 February 1957) on 31 October 1987 and had three sons.
*The Hon. Philip Wyndham Ashley Knatchbull (born 2 December 1961), married Atalanta Vereker &quot;née&quot; Cowan (born 20 June 1962), daughter of John Cowan, on 16 March 1991 and had two daughters, including Daisy Knatchbull; married Wendy Amanda Willis &quot;née&quot; Leach (born 20 July 1966), daughter of Robin H. Leach, of Ugley Park, Ugley, Essex, on 29 June 2002 and had two sons.
*The Hon. Nicholas Timothy Charles Knatchbull (18 November 1964 – 27 August 1979), killed by an IRA bomb.
*The Hon. Timothy Nicholas Sean Knatchbull (born 18 November 1964), married Isabella Julia Norman (born 9 January 1971), a great-great-granddaughter of the 4th Earl of Bradford, on 11 July 1998 and had five children.

As Lady Brabourne during her father&#x27;s lifetime, her immediate family became closely involved in the consideration of a future consort for her first cousin once removed, Charles, Prince of Wales. In early 1974, Lord Mountbatten began corresponding with the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip about a potential marriage to Lady Brabourne&#x27;s daughter, Amanda. Charles wrote to Lady Brabourne (who was also his godmother), about his interest in her daughter, to which she replied approvingly, though suggesting that a courtship was premature. Amanda Knatchbull declined the marriage proposal of Charles in 1980, following the assassination of her maternal grandfather.

==Activities==
Patricia was educated in Malta, England, and at the Hewitt School in New York City. In 1943, at age 19, she entered the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service as a Signal Rating and served in Combined Operations bases in Britain, including . She was then commissioned as a third officer in 1945 and serving in the Supreme Allied Headquarters, South East Asia.

In 1973 she was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Kent; she was also a serving magistrate and was involved with numerous service organisations including SOS Children&#x27;s Villages UK, of which she was a Patron; the Order of St John, of which she was a Dame; and the Countess Mountbatten&#x27;s Own Legion of Frontiersmen of the Commonwealth, of which she was a Patron.

On 15 June 1974, she succeeded her distant cousin Lady Patricia Ramsay, formerly HRH Princess Patricia of Connaught, as Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, for whom the regiment was named when Princess Patricia&#x27;s father, the Duke of Connaught, was Governor General of Canada during the First World War. Despite her succeeding to an earldom in her own right as Countess Mountbatten of Burma on the death of her father in 1979, she preferred that the officers and men of her regiment address her as Lady Patricia. She was succeeded by The Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson on 17 March 2007. On 28 August 2007, the Governor General of Canada presented her with the Canadian Meritorious Service Cross for her services as Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Light Infantry.

Patricia was in the boat which was blown up by the IRA off the shores of Mullaghmore, County Sligo, in August 1979, killing her 14-year-old son Nicholas; her father; her mother-in-law, the Dowager Baroness Brabourne; and 15-year-old Paul Maxwell, a boat-boy from County Fermanagh. She, her husband, and their son Timothy were injured but survived the attack. Following the incident the Countess became Patron and, later, President of The Compassionate Friends, a self-help charitable organisation of bereaved parents in the UK.

In June 2012, at the time of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s first visit to the Republic of Ireland, Countess Mountbatten said the Queen had her full support for meeting Martin McGuinness, who had been a high-ranking member of the IRA. &quot;I think it&#x27;s wonderful ... I&#x27;m hugely grateful that we have come to a point where we can behave responsibly and positively&quot;, she is reported to have said. In September 2012, she unveiled a memorial to the work of the Combined Operations Pilotage Parties at Hayling Island in Hampshire.

==Death and funeral==
Countess Mountbatten died at her home in Mersham, Kent, aged 93. Her funeral service took place on 27 June 2017 at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge, and was attended by the Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and other senior members of the royal family. Her casket was borne by a party of pall bearers from Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, who were in London on public duties. She was buried in the Knatchbull family plot in Mersham churchyard.

<text>Ireland West Airport , officially known as Ireland West Airport Knock, and formerly known as Horan International Airport, commonly known as Knock Airport, is an international airport south-west of Charlestown, County Mayo, Ireland. The village of Knock is away. 818,000 passengers used the airport in 2023, making it the fourth-busiest in Ireland (after Dublin, Cork and Shannon).

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
The airport opened on 25 October 1985 with three Aer Lingus charter flights to Rome: the official opening was on 30 May 1986. The idea behind the construction of Knock Airport was through Mr Sher Rafique, a multi millionaire during the 80s. The site, on a hill in boggy terrain, was thought by many to be unrealistic, but the airport was built following a long and controversial campaign by Monsignor James Horan, the story of which has even inspired a musical. The primary motivation for building it was to attract pilgrims to Knock Shrine. Despite criticisms that the site was too boggy and too foggy, Horan delivered an airport within five years, primarily financed by a Government grant of £9.8 million. He died shortly after the opening of the airport, and his funeral was held at the then-named Horan International Airport.

In recent times, Horan has been celebrated with a bronze statue erected at the airport.

By 1988, over 100,000 passengers had passed through. Aer Lingus commenced flights from the airport to Birmingham in 1995.

===Development since the 2000s===
Since 2003, flag-carrier, low-cost and regional airlines including Aer Lingus, MyTravelLite, Bmibaby, Ryanair, Aer Arann, flybe, Lufthansa and EasyJet have added routes to Great Britain and mainland Europe. Not all have proven successful, but by 2005 the airport was handling 500,000 passengers per annum.

It was voted Ireland&#x27;s best regional airport in 2006 and 2009 by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. 2007 was a notable year, with scheduled transatlantic services to New York and Boston commencing in May, operated by the now-defunct Flyglobespan.

A record 629,000 passengers used the airport in 2008, a 13% rise compared to the previous year. The installation of the Category II Instrument Landing System in April 2009 has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of flight diversions to other airports due to poor visibility – the airport is 200 metres above sea level. August 2009 was the busiest month for three years, with 81,000 passengers: 28 August was the busiest day in the airport&#x27;s history, with over 4,500 passengers.

In 2011, the month of August was the busiest in the airport&#x27;s history with 84,052 passengers. 2011 was the most successful year to date with 654,553 passengers. The year saw the commencement of routes to Lanzarote, Tenerife and Gran Canaria operated by Ryanair and to Edinburgh operated by flybe. During September 2011 Ryanair celebrated its four-millionth passenger through the airport, while Lufthansa announced it would be commencing weekly flights to Düsseldorf in May 2012. In November 2011, Ryanair announced flights to Beauvais-Tillé, Frankfurt-Hahn, Bergamo-Orio al Serio and Girona-Costa Brava from March 2012. In January 2012 the 20th scheduled route was announced—flybe to Leeds, its third from the airport, from March 2012. Budget carrier BmiBaby announced in May 2012 that it was to axe its only route to Birmingham from 10 June, owing to the airline&#x27;s takeover by IAG. Flights to Beauvais-Tillé and Frankfurt-Hahn have since ended.

In 2013, Ryanair launched a weekly summer route to Málaga on Thursdays. Aer Lingus Regional, which took over the Birmingham route operating a daily service using ATR 72s ended service on 26 October. Flybe began four-times-weekly flights on the route on 27 October. On 31 October 2013, in response to the scrapping of the Irish travel tax, Ryanair unveiled three new routes from Knock to Glasgow-Prestwick, Kaunas and Eindhoven. However, these routes had all been withdrawn by the fourth quarter of 2014.

It was announced in November 2017 that €15 million would be invested in improving and upgrading the airport in 2018 and 2019, to coincide with strong passenger growth. These plans include upgrading of car parks, passenger facilities, the terminal and resurfacing of the runway.

==Government assistance==
The building of the airport was primarily financed by Government grants totaling £9.858 million. The completion of the airport was funded by a £1.3 million grant from the European Union, payable on condition that the airport developers provided an equal sum from their own resources.

On 21 February 2007, the Government of Ireland announced that it was making a €27 million capital grant. The airport stated that it would continue the implementation of its €46 million infrastructural investment programme with over €20 million of spend anticipated for 2008. Work commenced on a number of significant civil and building projects in this year. A€5.5 million extension to the terminal building was completed in April 2009. The implementation of Category II Instrument Landing System (CAT II ILS) on runway 27, to enhance reliability in low visibility, has been completed and approved. An extension to the Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs) and runway turnpad was completed in March 2009.

Departing passengers aged 12 years and over pay a &quot;Development Fee&quot; of €10. The fee is a critical contributor to the ongoing sustainability of the airport and provides a vital funding source to support the ongoing development works of the airport.

In 2005, the airport changed its name to Ireland West Airport Knock. As of August 2009, the Aeronautical Information Publication, including the aeronautical charts available at European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, showed it as Ireland West.

==Corporate affairs==
The airport is owned and operated by Connaught Airport Development Company Ltd – a private company 82.5% owned by The Horan Airport Trust. The remaining 17.5% is owned by seven local authorities – Donegal County Council, Galway County Council, Galway City Council, Leitrim County Council, Mayo County Council, Roscommon County Council and Sligo County Council.

<doc id="633293" wikidata="Q3306606" url="?curid=633293" title="Charter trustee">
<text>In England and Wales, charter trustees are set up to maintain the continuity of a town charter or city charter after a district with the status of a borough or city has been abolished, until such time as a civil parish council or in larger settlements, a town council is established. Duties are limited to ceremonial activities such as the election of a mayor, and various other functions depending upon local customs and laws.

The charter trustees are made up of local councillors in the district representing wards within the boundaries of the town/city. If there are fewer than three district councillors for the former borough, then qualified local electors may be co-opted to make the number up to three.

Charter trustees must hold an annual meeting within twenty-one days of the annual meeting of the district council. The first item of business is the election of a town or city mayor and deputy mayor for the next year. 

As of 2023, there are nineteen areas in England which continue to appoint charter trustees.

==History==
===Local Government Act 1972===
The original bodies of charter trustees were set up in 1974, under section 246 of the Local Government Act 1972. The concept was introduced into the Bill by a government amendment in September 1972.

Section 245(4) of the Local Government Act 1972 allowed the shadow district councils to make a petition to the Queen for borough status, before their coming into effect on 1 April 1974. In this case, if &quot;it is signified on behalf of Her Majesty before that date that She proposes to accede&quot; to the request then, the style of borough could be used immediately from 1 April 1974, despite the fact that the charter would be presented only later.

For the new districts which made no such petition (or where it was refused), for each former municipal borough in the district which was to become an unparished area (rather than a successor parish), a body corporate was established under section 246(4) of the Act, styled as the charter trustees of the town or city.

In the original legislation, charter trustees could also be formed in Welsh districts, but the Charter Trustees Order 1974, which provided for the establishment of the trustees, stated that the section &quot;shall not apply to the area consisting of the counties established by section 20 of the Act (new local government areas in Wales)&quot;, and &quot;there will be no charter trustees in Wales.&quot;

===Charter Trustees Act 1985===

Originally, under section 246(7), when the district in which a town for which charter trustees had been established gained the status of a borough, the trustees would be immediately dissolved. Some new district councils petitioned for borough status soon after 1 April 1974, quickly dissolving the charter trustees.

This was changed by the Charter Trustees Act 1985, which provided that charter trustees would cease to exist only when a parish council was formed for the area of the former borough.

===Local Government Act 1992===
Legislation passed in 1992 led to the establishment of a Local Government Commission whose remit was to review the system created in 1974. As a result there was a partial reorganisation, with a number of districts with borough or city status being abolished. The mechanism of creating charter trustees to preserve civic traditions was again used. However, trustees were created only where an outgoing council requested their establishment. The failure of the extinguished City of Rochester-upon-Medway council to appoint charter trustees for Rochester or to apply for Rochester&#x27;s city status to be transferred to the replacement unitary authority of Medway led to Rochester losing its city status.

Some abolished boroughs such as Beverley included a large rural area. In such cases, the charter trustees were not established for the entire area of the former borough, but were limited to that part of the new authority which was unparished: the area identifiable as the town.

===Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007===
A further wave of reorganisations came into effect in some areas of England on 1 April 2009, under the terms of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. The reforms saw the creation of new unitary authorities and the abolition of a number of districts with city or borough status. The Charter Trustees Regulations 2009 allow for the creation of trustees to preserve civic traditions in those areas where there is no obvious successor parish council. In the case of the cities of Chester and Durham the charter trustees area are identical to the entire abolished district, which includes not only the central unparished area but also the surrounding parishes.

=== Current ===
=== Former ===
==Changes==

=== 2009 ===
The structural changes to local government in 2009 led to the formation of Charter Trustees for Crewe, Macclesfield, Chester and Ellsemere Port. The Charter Trustees for Crewe and Macclesfield were subsequently abolished and replaced by parishes.

=== 2019 ===
Charter trustees were established in April 2019 for Bournemouth, Poole and Taunton as a consequence of local government structural changes in Dorset and Somerset.

=== 2023 ===
On 1 April 2023 the unitary authorities of Cumberland, Westmorland and Furness, and North Yorkshire were established. Charter trustees were established for Carlisle (which also preserved its city status), Barrow, Harrogate and Scarborough.

<text>Robert Jastrow (September 7, 1925 – February 8, 2008) was an American astronomer and planetary physicist. He was a NASA scientist, populist author and futurist.

== Education ==

Jastrow attended Townsend Harris High School. He also attended the summer program at Camp Rising Sun. He entered Columbia University for his undergraduate and graduate college, where he earned the BA, MA (1945), and PhD (1948) degrees in physics.

==Career ==

After leaving Columbia, Jastrow became an assistant professor at Yale, and then joined the Naval Research Laboratory. In 1958, he joined the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration as head of its theoretical division. In 1961, he became the founding director of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and served as its director until his retirement from NASA in 1981. Concurrently, he was a professor of Geophysics at Columbia University.

Jastrow was the first chairman of NASA’s Lunar Exploration Committee, which established the scientific goals for the exploration of the Moon during the Apollo lunar landings. 
Jastrow was a public figure, prolific author and commentator on a range of topics including the space program, astronomy, earth science, and national security issues. He lectured on CBS and NBC, and his book, &quot;Red Giants and White Dwarfs: The Evolution of Stars&quot;. was a bestseller

In 1981, Jastrow left NASA to join the faculty of Dartmouth College as professor of Earth Sciences. He left Dartmouth in 1992 to take up duties as director and chairman of the Mount Wilson Institute, managing the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. Jastrow was a member of the NASA Alumni Association. In 1984, Jastrow, together with Fred Seitz and William Nierenberg, founded the George C. Marshall Institute, an organization that assessed scientific issues affecting public policy in Washington, DC. The institute supported U. S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative (&quot;Star Wars&quot;), for example in Jastrow&#x27;s 1985 &quot;How to Make Nuclear Weapons Obsolete&quot;. He also became a prominent climate change denier. The George C. Marshall Institute opposed the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming. Jastrow acknowledged that Earth was experiencing a warming trend but claimed that the cause was likely to be natural variation. 
Jastrow served as Chairman Emeritus of the George C. Marshall Institute until his death.

== Religious views ==
His expressed views on creation were that although he was an &quot;agnostic, and not a believer&quot;, it seems to him that &quot;the curtain drawn over the mystery of creation will never be raised by human efforts, at least in the foreseeable future&quot; due to &quot;the circumstances of the Big Bang-the fiery holocaust that destroyed the record of the past&quot;. With the discovery of the Big Bang, Jastrow began to hold a belief that, if there was a beginning to the universe, there was also a Creator.

In an interview with &quot;Christianity Today,&quot; Jastrow said &quot;Astronomers now find they have painted themselves into a corner because they have proven, by their own methods, that the world began abruptly in an act of creation to which you can trace the seeds of every star, every planet, every living thing in this cosmos and on the earth. And they have found that all this happened as a product of forces they cannot hope to discover. That there are what I or anyone would call supernatural forces at work is now, I think, a scientifically proven fact.&quot;

In his book, &quot;God and The Astronomers&quot; he illustrated his position as: “For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance, he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.”
In a 1995 panel discussion on the PBS show, &quot;Think Tank with Ben Wattenberg&quot;, Jastrow summed up his position on the apparent conflict between science and religion by saying

The nominees for the 71st Academy Awards were announced on February 9, 1999, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Robert Rehme, president of the Academy, and the actor Kevin Spacey. &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; earned the most nominations with 13; &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; came in second place with 11.

The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 21, 1999. &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; was the second film nominated simultaneously for Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film in the same year (the first being &quot;Z&quot; in 1969). Best Actor winner Roberto Benigni was the second person to direct himself to an acting Oscar win. Laurence Olivier first achieved this feat for his performance in 1948&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He also became the fourth individual to earn acting, directing, screenwriting nominations for the same film. In addition, Benigni was the third performer to win an Oscar for a non-English speaking role. By virtue of their nominations for portraying Queen Elizabeth I of England, Best Actress nominee Cate Blanchett and Best Supporting Actress winner Judi Dench became the first pair of actresses to earn acting nominations in the same year for portraying the same character in different films. Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian person to be nominated for Best Actress category.

==Ceremony information==
Riding on the success of the previous year&#x27;s ceremony which garnered record-high viewership figures and several Emmys, AMPAS sought changes to the festivities that would help build upon this recent success. In June 1998, Academy president Robert Rehme announced that the show would be held on a Sunday for the first time in history. AMPAS and network ABC hoped to capitalize on the high television ratings and viewership that benefit programs airing on that particular day of the week. The Academy also stated that the move to Sunday would ease concerns about traffic gridlock and transportation that are significantly lower on weekends.

The following January, Gil Cates was selected as a producer of the telecast. He immediately selected Oscar-winning actress Whoopi Goldberg as host of the 1999 ceremony. Cates explained his decision to bring back Goldberg as host saying, &quot;The audience adores Whoopi and that affection, plus Whoopi&#x27;s extraordinary talent makes her a terrific host for the show.&quot; In a statement, Goldberg expressed that she was honored and excited to be selected to emcee the telecast commenting, &quot;I am thrilled to escort Oscar into the new millennium. Who would have thought that I would be hosting the last Oscar telecast of the century? It&#x27;s a huge deal.&quot;
Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony and its related events. Bill Conti served as musical director for the festivities. In addition to supervising the Best Song nominee performances, choreographer Debbie Allen produced a dance number featuring five dancers from around the world showcasing the nominees for Best Original Dramatic Score. For the first time, the Academy produced its own pre-show that preceded the main telecast. Produced by Dennis Doty, the half-hour program was hosted by actress Geena Davis and CNN reporter Jim Moret. Similar to coverage of red carpet arrivals on networks such as E!, the pre-show featured interviews with nominees and other guests, recaps of nominations and segments highlighting behind-the-scenes preparations for the telecast.

===Box office performance of nominees===
At the time of the nominations announcement on February 9, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees was $302 million with an average of $60.4 million per film. &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $194.2 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; ($36.5 million), &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; ($30.6 million), &quot;Elizabeth&quot; ($21.5 million), and finally &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; ($18.4 million).

Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 36 nominations went to 13 films on the list. Only &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (2nd), &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (11th), &quot;A Civil Action&quot; (40th) and &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (50th) were nominated for Best Picture, directing, acting or screenwriting. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1st), &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (5th), &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (12th), &quot;Mulan&quot; (13th), &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (17th), &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (18th), &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; (24th), &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (37th) and &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (49th).

===Critical reviews===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Columnist Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; quipped that &quot;Whoopi bombed last night, she knew it—and yet, crassly, she took it as a sign of her own outrageousness.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; television critic Tom Shales bemoaned that Goldberg &quot;spent a great deal of time laughing at her own jokes, many of which were dirty, a few dirty.&quot; He also lambasted the host&#x27;s presentation of the five Best Costume Design nominees saying calling it time-consuming and tasteless. Film critic John Hartl of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; lamented that the telecast &quot;was the longest and possibly the dullest Oscar show of the century, clocking in at four hours.&quot;

Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Television columnist Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; commended Goldberg&#x27;s hosting performance writing that he liked &quot;the sharper, more socially conscious edge Goldberg brings.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; television critic Matthew Gilbert commented, &quot;It was the perfect year with more than enough Hollywood intrigue and a battle for her to play off.&quot; Joanne Ostrow of &quot;The Denver Post&quot; raved that &quot;Whoopi definitely was on, more so than in her two previous hosting stints.&quot; She added that &quot;the show was exceptionally smooth.&quot;

===Ratings and reception===
The American telecast on ABC drew an average of 45.51 million viewers over its length, which was an 18% decrease from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony. An estimated 78.10 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 28.63% of households watching over a 47.79 share. It also drew a lower 1849 demo rating with an 18.85 rating over a 37.31 share among viewers in that demographic.

In July 1999, the show received seven nominations at the 51st Primetime Emmy Awards. Two months later, the ceremony won two of those nominations for Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music Program (Roy Christopher and Stephen Olson) and Outstanding Lighting Direction for a Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special (Robert Dickinson, Robert T. Barnhart, Andy O&#x27;Reilly, Matt Ford).
